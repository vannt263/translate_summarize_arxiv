    "in his famous book on thermodynamics  @xcite , leontovich refers to thermodynamics as a phenomenological science , i.e. , based on a series of `` statements established experimentally '' . beginning with the creation of satellites and experiments in the absence of the gravity field of earth ,",
    "a new period in physical experimental investigations of thermodynamical phenomena occurred .",
    "although these experiments are carried out by robots , and they can not react like a human being to any situation and to change the parameters of the experiment like an animate observer , this must nevertheless unavoidably lead to a reconsideration of the original conception of the great physicists .    on the other hand , computer - aided experiments have been developed so greatly that a new science arose , the so - called molecular dynamics .",
    "the problem of the mathematical axiomatization of thermodynamics and probability theory was posed already by hilbert .",
    "already poincar gave the standard definition of probability as the ratio of the number of cases favorable for the event to the total number of possible events and gave a counterexample to this definition of probability .",
    "this definition must be completed , writes poincar , by the sentence `` under the assumption that these cases are equiprobable '' ( @xcite , russian p.  116 ) and notes that we have completed a vicious circle place by defining probability via probability .",
    "after this , poincar writes : `` the conclusion which seems to follow from this is that the calculus of probabilities is a useless science , that the obscure instinct which we call common sense , and to which we appeal for the legitimisation of our conventions , must be distrusted . ''",
    "( @xcite , russian p.  116 ) .",
    "thus , first of all , the problem is to define what cases can be most naturally assumed to be equiprobable .",
    "`` we are to look for a mathematical thought , '' writes poincar , `` where is remains pure , i.e. , in arithmetic '' ( @xcite , russian p.  14 ) .",
    "the relationship between the quantum statistics of bose gas with number theory ( `` arithmetics '' ) was traced by vershik , one of the greatest contemporary mathematicians , who followed temperley , a famous physicist  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , poincar notes that one still can not reject probability theory , because probability theory is related to thermodynamics , and thermodynamics to experiment .",
    "the author had to study the modern experiments in the most thorough way and profited from consultations with the great russian virtuosi in experimental physics , including v.  v.  brazhkin , k.  i.  shmulovich , a.  a.  vasserman , v.  i.  nedostup , v.  g.  baidakov , a.  e.  gekhman , and also v.  a.  istomin , the greatest expert in applied thermodynamics and the theory of gas mixtures .",
    "it was necessary to study the works of professor  d.  i.  ivanov especially thoroughly ; professor ivanov discovered a discrepancy between the widom ",
    "wilson theoretical critical exponents  ( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) with the experimental ones  ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) and carried out classical measurements in thermodynamics .",
    "birkhoff , a great mathematician , devoted the first chapter of his book `` hydrodynamics '' to paradoxes in hydrodynamics . in the strict mathematical understanding ,",
    "a paradox is a counterexample to a system of axioms .",
    "first of all , the system of axioms we have constructed includes a modified analog of the `` equidistribution law ''  @xcite .",
    "our main axiom is the second one , which claims the ( almost ) uniform distribution of densities in a vessel .",
    "this axiom leads to number theory , where , instead of presenting all the theorems , we address the intuition of the physicists who are acquainted with the bose ",
    "einstein distribution ( this distribution is closely related to number theory ) .",
    "this is sufficient for a new conception of the notion of ideal gas .",
    "further we use the third axiom , claiming the existence of the zeno - line for pure gases , which enables us to pass from ideal gases to unperfect ones . to explain the maxwell rule and the jumps of critical indices at a critical point ,",
    "as compared with the classical ones , we use the axiom of tunnel quantization of the classical equation of state , which thus encloses the system of four axioms .",
    "the theory of ideal liquid treated as an incompressible one is a certain new model in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "following clausius , experts in molecular physics usually argue by proceeding from the symmetry of the motion of a molecule averaged in all six directions . in the scattering problem",
    ", we use the principle of symmetry in all directions , which is standard in molecular physics , but apply it to define not the mean free path , but other molecular physics quantities .",
    "therefore , the fraction of all particles that moves head - on is 1/12 .",
    "there are three such directions ; hence , one quarter of all molecules collide . ] .    for the interaction potential",
    ", we consider the lennard ",
    "jones potential @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy of the depth of the well and @xmath3 is the effective radius .    in the absence of an external potential",
    ", the two - particle problem reduces to the one - dimensional radial - symmetric one . as is well known  @xcite , two quantities : the energy  @xmath4 and the momentum  @xmath5 are conserved in this problem . in the scattering problem , it is convenient to consider , instead of the momentum  @xmath5 , another preserved constant , namely , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the impact parameter , in such a way that @xmath8    by solving with respect to energy @xmath4 the well - known relation @xmath9 we obtain the attracting hamiltonian @xmath10 : @xmath11 the repulsing hamiltonian is separated from @xmath10 by a barrier .",
    "repulsive particles put obstacles in the way of particles of the hamiltonian @xmath10 , by creating `` viscosity '' .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the barrier height increases up to the value @xmath12 , and then starts decreasing ( see  fig .  1 ) .",
    "according to rough energy estimates  @xcite , for lesser temperatures , an additional barrier must arise when clusters form .",
    "this barrier can be given for carbon dioxide gas by micelles and for neutral gases and methane by germs of droplets , i.e. , three - dimensional clusters that contain at least one molecule surrounded by other molecules ( a prototype of a droplet ) .",
    "for diverse values of the target parameter . ]    however , to study the penetration through the barrier of the incident particle , we must plot  @xmath4 along the @xmath13 axis and turn the wells upside down .",
    "then the minimum becomes the barrier and the maximum becomes the depth of the well .     of the @xmath14-point is marked on the abscissa axis .",
    "the particle falls from the left from the point @xmath15 , where @xmath7 stands for the target parameter . in the original problem   ( before the change of variables @xmath16 )",
    "the relation @xmath15 is attained as @xmath17.,width=264 ]    a dimer can be formed in a classical domain if the scattering pair has an energy equal to the barrier height , slipping into the dip in  infinite \" time and getting stuck in it as a result of viscosity ( and hence of some small energy loss ) , because this pair of particles , having lost energy , hits the barrier on the return path .",
    "if the pair of particles has passed above this point , then the viscosity may be insufficient for the pair to become stuck : such a pair returns above the barrier after reflection .",
    "therefore , only the existence of a point  @xmath18 plus an infinitesimal quantity , where @xmath19 is the upper barrier point , is a necessary condition for the pair to be stuck inside the dip ; @xmath20 is the height of the maximum barrier .",
    "we can compare the values @xmath21 with the values @xmath20 in the table below .",
    "@xmath22    above the value @xmath23 , the trap disappears . at the value @xmath24 , the depth of the trap is maximum and corresponds to @xmath25 . for neon and krypton ,",
    "as can be seen from the table , the concurrence is sufficiently good . because @xmath26 , it follows that @xmath27 , which corresponds to the known relation of `` the law of corresponding states ''  @xcite .",
    "the temperature corresponding to @xmath28 , is the temperature above which dimers do not appear .",
    "exactly this is what we call the boyle temperature ( in contrast to  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , an application of the clausius approach to the pairwise interaction gives a pairwise interaction with respect to the lennard ",
    "jones potential for two gibbs ensembles of noninteracting molecules .",
    "this leads to the presence of a small friction for a single pair .",
    "the difference @xmath29 is equal to the energy needed for a particle lying at the bottom of the potential well to overcome the barrier .",
    "the value @xmath19 corresponds to the temperature given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 stands for the universal gas constant . according to graph  2",
    ", @xmath32 corresponds to the energy @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 is the compressibility factor , @xmath35 .",
    "the temperature at the point @xmath36 is equal to the boyle temperature .",
    "the dressed or `` thermal '' potential @xmath37 is attractive  @xcite .",
    "in addition , because the volume  @xmath38 is a large parameter , it follows that , if the quantity @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a smooth function and @xmath41 stands for the number of particles , is expanded in terms of @xmath42 , then @xmath43 expanding @xmath44 where @xmath45 , we can , just as in  @xcite , separate the variables in the two - particle problem and obtain the scattering problem for pairs of particles and the problem of their cooperative motion for @xmath46 . the term @xmath47 does not depend on this problem and the correction @xmath48 is small .",
    "then , in the scattering problem , an attractive quadratic potential ( inverted parabola multiplied by the density or , to be more precise , by the concentration , which we denote by the symbol  @xmath7 as well , because the target parameter does not occur below ) is added to the lennard ",
    "jones interaction potential .    for this problem",
    ", we can find just as in  ",
    ", for all @xmath49 , a point corresponding to the temperature at which the well capturing the dimers vanishes , and thus determine the so - called zeno - line .",
    "it is actually a straight line ( up to 2% ) , on which @xmath50 ( i.e. , an ideal curve ) .",
    "let us clarify this fact in more detail .",
    "we can treat the repulsing potential as a potential creating a small viscosity .",
    "let us find the total energy of the attracting hamiltonian , @xmath51 the first term is negative for @xmath52 and the other term is positive for @xmath53 ( i.e. , the more is the speed , the less is energy ) .",
    "the mean speed is temperature .",
    "let us make the change of variables @xmath54 and get rid of  @xmath3 .",
    "in what follows , we omit both the tilde and the prime .    for a given @xmath55 ,",
    "the minimum @xmath56 and the maximum @xmath57 ( see the graph no .  1 in  @xcite ) are defined by the relation @xmath58    this gives @xmath19 and @xmath32 .",
    "these values coincide at some point @xmath59 , and hence @xmath60 at the point @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 , and this is the very zeno - line .",
    "let us construct the curve @xmath63 minimal with respect to the target parameter as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "let us find the point @xmath64 for @xmath65 and find the corresponding point on the curve @xmath66 .",
    "this point is equal to @xmath67 , i.e. , to the critical value of the compressibility factor @xmath68 for argon .    .",
    "this heuristic binodal does not coincide with the experimental one , whereas the zeno - line and @xmath69 are close to the corresponding experimental curves.,width=264 ]    in order to obtain a binodal according to some `` heuristic principle , '' we must subtract the curve @xmath66  @xcite from the zeno - line .",
    "this gives the graph shown in fig  3 .",
    "in an example describing the creation of a dimer , it is shown that , for @xmath70 , one degree of freedom becomes `` frozen '' , and we obtain two degrees of freedom rather than three . for a dimer with @xmath71 ,",
    "if the oscillational degrees of freedom are taken into account , then the number of degrees of freedom becomes equal to  6 .",
    "two degrees of freedom are obtained under the assumption that the oscillational degrees of freedom of the dimer are also `` frozen '' at @xmath70 .",
    "if we suppose this heuristic supposition for the quantum case , then , for @xmath72 , both dimers with two degrees of freedom and dimers with six degrees of freedom are created .",
    "this corresponds to the two - liquid thiess  landau model  [ 67 ] . in this case",
    ", the dimers with two degrees of freedom give the @xmath73-point and the dimers with six degrees of freedom give superfluidity .",
    "indeed , in the two - dimensional case we have @xmath74 and we obtain a logarithmic divergence at the point @xmath75 for @xmath76 .    the case",
    "in which @xmath41 is not so large as it is in statistical physics , i.e. , the so - called mesoscopic state ( see  [ 68 ] ) , can also be of interest for us . in this case , let us use fock s idea for the hartree equations , which lead to the hartree ",
    "fock equations , which agree well with experiments for a not too large number of electrons in atoms .",
    "namely , we consider the single - particle equation of the mean field ( a self - consistent field ) and apply ( to the resulting `` dressed '' potential ) the procedure of transition to the @xmath41-partial schrdinger equation with a dressed potential , just as we proceeded above for the operator @xmath77 . here",
    "we can consider two ways of investigation .",
    "the first way is the way used by fock and which leads in the semiclassical limit to the thomas  fermi equations for the dressed potential .",
    "another way is to consider the hartree temperature equations ( see  [ 69 ] ) and to obtain the thomas  fermi temperature equations in the classical limit .",
    "since the quantity @xmath78 is small , it is easier to use the first way and to find the `` dressed '' potential .",
    "let @xmath79 be a pairwise interaction potential such that @xmath80 .",
    "the dressed potential @xmath81 is given by the formula @xmath82 where @xmath83 stands for the external potential and @xmath84 for an eigenfunction of the schrdinger equation which depends on the `` dressed '' potential and is thus an equation with a `` unitary '' nonlinearity .",
    "the expansion of the equation in powers of @xmath85 can be found by the method of complex germ up to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is an an arbitrarily large number , one obtains bogolyubov s famous equation  [ 70 ] .",
    "the creation of dimers leads to the ultrasecond quantization , i.e. , to the operators of creation and annihilation of pairs .",
    "this makes it possible to satisfy the boundary conditions in a capillary  ( 4648 , 7173 ) . ]",
    "( see  [ 69 ] , where system  ( 63 ) defines a complex germ ; see also  [ 40 ] , [ 7580 ] ) .",
    "further , we consider two asymptotic formulas for the number of eigenvalues of the one - particle schrdinger operator .    the @xmath88-dimensional phase space is partitioned into a lattice , and the number @xmath89 is determined by the formula @xmath90 this relation was obtained by weyl .    in the mathematical literature , the same notion for the number of eigenvalues of the laplace operator with the dirichlet conditions on the boundary of a @xmath91-dimensional volume , which are less or equal to a given @xmath92 , is called the courant formula : @xmath93 where @xmath91 stands for the dimension of the space , because the spectral density has the asymptotic behavior .",
    "the asymptotics @xmath94 is a natural generalization of formula  .    to reconcile the notion of bose statistics which is given in  [ 9 ] with symmetric solutions of the @xmath41-particle schrdinger equation , i.e. , of the direct sum of @xmath41 noninteracting hamiltonians corresponding to the schrdinger equation , and the symmetric solutions of their spectrum , it is more appropriate to assign to the cells the multiplicities of the spectrum of the schrdinger equation in the way described in  [ 81 ] .    consider the nonrelativistic case in which the hamiltonian @xmath10 is equal to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 stands for the momentum .",
    "the comparison of @xmath97 with the multiplicities of the spectrum of the schrdinger equation gives a correspondence between the eigenfunctions of the @xmath41-partial schrdinger equation that are symmetric with respect to the permutations of particles and the combinatorial calculations of the bose statistics that are presented in  [ 9 ] .",
    "a single - particle @xmath98-function satisfies the free schrodinger equation with the dirichlet conditions on the vessel walls .    using precisely this very correspondence",
    ", we establish a relationship between the bose ",
    "einstein combinatorics  [ 9 ] , the definition of the @xmath41-particle schrdinger equation , and the multiplicity of the spectrum of the single - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "the spectrum of the single - particle schrdinger equation , provided that the interaction potential is not taken into account , coincides , up to a factor , with the spectrum of the laplace operator .",
    "consider its spectrum for the closed interval , for the square , and for the @xmath91-dimensional cube with zero boundary conditions .",
    "this spectrum obviously consists of the sum of one - dimensional spectra .",
    "on the line we mark the points @xmath99 and on the coordinate axes @xmath100 of the plane we mark the points with @xmath101 and @xmath102 . to this set of points @xmath103",
    "we assign the points on the line that are positive integers , @xmath104 .    to every point we assign a pair of points , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , by the rule @xmath107 .",
    "the number of these points is @xmath108 .",
    "this is the two - dimensional case .",
    "consider the 3-dimensional case .",
    "on the axis @xmath109 we set @xmath110 , i.e. , let @xmath111 in this case , the number of points @xmath112 is equal to @xmath113    it can readily be seen , for the @xmath91-dimensional case , that the sequence of multiplicities for the number of variants @xmath114 , where @xmath115 are arbitrary positive integers , is of the form @xmath116",
    "@xmath117    the following problem in number theory corresponds to the three - dimensional case @xmath118 ( cf .  [ 9 ] ) : @xmath119    in the manual  [ 9 ] , following einstein , a passage to the limit is carried out as @xmath120 , which enables one to pass from sums to integrals .",
    "then , in the section `` degenerate bose gas , '' a point is distinguished which corresponds to the energy equal to zero .",
    "this very point is the point of bose condensate on which excessive particles whose number exceeds some value @xmath121 are accumulated at temperatures below the so - called degeneracy temperature @xmath78 .",
    "the theoretical discovery of this point anticipated a number of experiments that confirmed this fact not only for liquid helium but also for a series of metals and even for hydrogen .    from a mathematical point of view , distinguishing a point in the integral is an incorrect operation if this point does not form a @xmath122 function .",
    "the author obtained a more precise expression for the bose ",
    "einstein but for finite values @xmath121 ( see , e.g. ,  [ 82 ] ) .",
    "thus , we consider the case in which @xmath123 , but @xmath124 is not equal to infinity , on the physical level of rigor  [ 82 ] . for the final parastatistics we have @xmath125 in our case , we have @xmath126 , and the point of condensate is @xmath127 .    by  , it is clear that @xmath89 is associated with the @xmath91-dimensional lebesgue measure and , in the limit with respect to the coordinates @xmath128 , gives the volume  @xmath38 in the space of dimension  @xmath129 and the area @xmath130 in the space of dimension  @xmath131 .",
    "the passage with respect to the momenta @xmath132 is also valid as @xmath120 and @xmath133 , where @xmath122 is arbitrarily small .",
    "expanding  ( [ kvas ] ) at the point @xmath127 in the small parameter @xmath134 , where @xmath135 stands for the number of particles corresponding to the degeneration and @xmath78 for the degeneracy temperature , and writing @xmath136 , we obtain @xmath137    for example , if @xmath138 , then @xmath139 , and hence the number @xmath140 in the condensate at @xmath141 does not exceed @xmath142 . if @xmath143 , then @xmath144 .",
    "certainly , this affects the degeneracy temperature , because this temperature can be expressed only in terms of the number of particles above the condensate , @xmath145 , rather than in terms of the total number of particles @xmath135 ( which is equal to the sum of @xmath145 and of the number of particles in the condensate ) .",
    "write @xmath146 , where @xmath147 stands for the coefficient in formula   for @xmath148 .",
    "let us find @xmath149 , @xmath150 where @xmath151 whence we obtain the coefficient @xmath152 in the formula , @xmath153    to begin the summation in   at the zero index ( beginning with the zero energy ) , it is necessary to rewrite the sums   in the form @xmath154    the relationship between the degeneracy temperature and the number @xmath145 of particles above the condensate for @xmath133 ( where @xmath122 is arbitrarily small ) can be found for @xmath155 in the standard way .",
    "thus , we have established a relationship between @xmath97 in formula   ( which is combinatorially statistical ) and the multiplicity of the spectrum for the single - particle schrdinger equation , i.e. , between the statistical  [ 9 ] and quantum - mechanical definitions of bose particles .",
    "consider the two - dimensional case in more detail .",
    "there is an erds theorem for a system of two diophantine equations , @xmath156 the maximum number of solutions of this system is achieved if the following relation is satisfied : @xmath157 and if the coefficient @xmath3 is defined by the formula @xmath158 .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath159 into one summand gives only one version .",
    "the decomposition @xmath159 into @xmath159 summands also provides only one version ( namely , the sum of ones ) .",
    "therefore , somewhere in the interval must be at least one maximum of the variants .",
    "erds had evaluated it   ( see  [ 83 ] )",
    ".    if the number @xmath41 increases and @xmath5 is preserved in the problem  , then the number of solutions decreases .",
    "if the sums   are counted from zero rather than from one , i.e. , if we set @xmath160 then the number of solutions does not decrease and remains constant .",
    "i shall try to explain this effect .",
    "the erds  lehner problem  [ 84 ] is to decompose @xmath159 into @xmath161 summands .",
    "let us expand the number @xmath162 into two summands .",
    "we obtain @xmath163 .",
    "the total number is @xmath131 versions ( this problem is known as `` partitio numerorum '' ) .",
    "if we include  @xmath164 to the possible summands , we obtain three versions : @xmath165 .",
    "thus , the inclusion of zero makes it possible to say that we expand a number into @xmath166 summands .",
    "indeed , the expansion of the number @xmath162 into three summands includes all the previous versions , namely , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , and adds new versions , which do not include zero .    in this case , the maximum does not change drastically  [ 84 ] ; however , the number of versions is not changed , namely , the zeros , i.e. , the bose condensate , make it possible that the maximum remains constant , and the entropy never decreases ; after reaching the maximum , it becomes constant .",
    "let us turn to a physical definition .",
    "note first that , without changing the accuracy of the quantity whose logarithm is evaluated , we can replace @xmath170 by @xmath171 .",
    "then @xmath172 in our case , @xmath173 corresponds to the number of particles above the condensate .",
    "according to formula  , in the two - dimensional case we must set @xmath174 and find the coefficient @xmath152 .",
    "then formula   gives us a relationship between @xmath145 and @xmath78 due to the fact that the number of particles in the condensate is @xmath175 .",
    "in fact , we have proved that there is a gap between @xmath133 and @xmath176 .",
    "consider the maxwell distribution @xmath177 as is well known , it is associated with the potential @xmath178    now consider an ultrarelativistic gas in which the kinetic energy is proportional to  @xmath179 . in this case , @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the velocity of light .",
    "for this gas , the potential  @xmath182 is of the form @xmath183 since @xmath184 and @xmath185 , it follows that , in both the first and the second case , we obtain the equation of an ideal gas @xmath186    in thermodynamics , there is an important notion , namely , @xmath187 , the number of the degrees of freedom of the molecule .",
    "the energy of the molecule is @xmath188 the parameter @xmath187 ( the number of degrees of freedom ) is the coefficient at the potential  @xmath182 .",
    "it does not influence the equation of ideal gas  .",
    "this coefficient is related to the so - called `` equidistribution law '' mentioned above .",
    "possibly , the law is true in some interval of temperatures . however , as the temperature reduces .",
    "some degrees of freedom can be `` frozen . ''",
    "it turns out that it is much more convenient to introduce the parameter @xmath189 presented below .    assuming that the value of @xmath187 depends on the momentum , we replace the above relation by the following one : @xmath190 where @xmath191 stands for some typical momentum .",
    "we can say that both the average momentum and the number of the degrees of freedom depend on the temperature , and hence the number of the degrees of freedom depends on the momentum .",
    "we assume that this dependence is the simplest one , namely , it is a power dependence ( the parameter  @xmath189 of in the exponent characterizes the molecule ) .",
    "here the potential @xmath182 takes the form @xmath192 where @xmath193 stands for a constant corresponding to a given molecule and depending on its mass ( however , we try to avoid the mass by passing from the density to the concentration ) .",
    "it can readily be seen that , in this case , relation   remains valid for an ideal gas .",
    "thus , we replace the parameter of the integer degrees of freedom by some continuous parameter that characterizes the given molecule . in principle , this parameter @xmath194 is of the same physical origin as the number of the degrees of freedom .",
    "but since it is continuous , it takes into account more details of the spectrum of the molecule .    moreover , below we shall see the following remarkable fact : every molecule is characterized by its own value of @xmath194 which does not depend on temperature and depends only on the dimensionless value @xmath69 , which is its critical compressibility factor .",
    "one must not think that this relation ( formula  ) holds for a single molecule .",
    "it can be treated only as a result of averaging over the gibbs ensemble of noninteracting molecules that corresponds to some temperature ( as we shall see below , this ensemble corresponds to the critical temperature @xmath21 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the number of degrees of freedom is related to the number of atoms  @xcite , whereas the number of atoms is related to the dimension of the space .",
    "for this reason , the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom , as the temperature reduced , is equivalent in a gibbs ensemble of noninteracting molecules to the reduction of the mean value of the space dimension . on the other hand",
    ", one can say that the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom is analogous to the reduction of the dimension of the space of oscillators ( from three - dimensional to zero - dimensional oscillators ) , whereas the latter reduction is equivalent ( see sec .  5 ) to the halving of the dimension of the momentum space .",
    "however , for the value of the potential @xmath182 , increasing of the exponent of @xmath96 in energy is equivalent to the reduction of the fractal dimension when integrating with respect to @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the passage to  @xmath195 , which is regarded as an equivalent notion of fractal dimension , is related to averaging of the gibbs ensemble of noninteracting molecules with respect to the number of active degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the formal change of variable in manuals  ( @xcite , p.  212 ) and handbooks  @xcite ( see the section `` integral representations '' in  @xcite and also the book  @xcite ) has a well - founded physical meaning of continuous reduction of a fractional value of the number of degrees of freedom of a molecule as the temperature reduces ( in the mean ) for a gibbs ensemble of noninteracting molecules .    a.  v.  chaplik suggested another interpretation of this law . since it turns out that a law of the form @xmath196 enables us to describe the experiment , and since we assume that this is an ideal gas of particles with this dependence , @xmath195 , it follows that these are quasiparticles , i.e. , collective excitements ( rather than individual molecules ) .",
    "the @xmath96-momentum of the quasiparticle is preserved , because the interaction between the particles is no longer valid .",
    "this trick is customary in physics .",
    "however , in mathematics , the notion of gibbs ensemble corresponds to the notion of the kolmogorov complexity , and therefore , for a mathematician , it is more natural to relate the formula @xmath195 to this vary complexity",
    ". however , the main point is that this generalizes the notion of equidistribution to lower temperatures .",
    "now we can rigorously formulate the axiom of thermodynamics corresponding to the approximate conservation of the gas density ( this corresponds to the physicists statement in equilibrium thermodynamics : `` the density is homogeneous in a vessel '' ; physicists consider equilibrium thermodynamics as a separate discipline , after which fluctuation theory is also considered separately ) .",
    "a physicist thinks that the density of particles inside the vessel is constant up to fluctuations ( of the order of the square root of the number of particles in a small subvolume ) .",
    "this means that the physicist counts the number of particles in every small subvolume containing approximately one million of particles , and the density does not depend on the permutation of the numbers of particles .",
    "however , this is arithmetics , in which the sum does not depend on the permutation of summands ( in contrast to the boltzmann statistics in which a permutation of particles gives a new state ) .",
    "even if we assume that the experimenter had indexed all particles during the previous measurement , this experimenter can not control what index corresponds to a given particle at the next moment of measurement , and the indexing can be carried out again to compute the density .",
    "this is a fact in arithmetics , which is the very base of a special branch of science , namely , of analytic number theory .",
    "* main mathematical axiom of thermodynamics . * _ consider a vessel of volume @xmath38 containing @xmath197 identical molecules corresponding to the parameter @xmath198 . consider a small convex volume of size  @xmath199 containing @xmath200 particles , where @xmath200 is not less than @xmath201 .",

    "the claim of the axiom is that the probability  @xmath202 is sufficiently small .",
    "namely , _ @xmath204    this implies that the numbering of particles in the volume @xmath199 is arbitrary and does not affect the density .",
    "we can rearrange the numbers , and this also does not affect the density , because the rearrangement of summands does not change the sum - particle dynamical system can be said to be chaotic if a relation of the form   arises at a sufficiently large time interval .",

    "@xmath316 i.e. , @xmath317    following m.  green  @xcite , d.  yu .  ivanov , a deep experimenter , poses the following question : why are the deviations from the classical theory in the critical opalescence observed within the limits of hundredths of a degree from the critical points , whereas the deviations in thermodynamical properties show  @xcite a nonclassical behavior at a much larger distance from the critical point ? .",
    "professor ivanov claims that rather many questions of this kind have been accumulated ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , and all these questions mainly deal with the behavior of practical systems .",
    "the point is that , from the point of view of the developed theory of critical indices  @xcite , there must be a drastic passage to the classical indices outside a neighborhood of the critical point .    to make ivanov s question understandable for persons who are not experts in critical points , we paraphrase the question for the case of geometric optics , when the sun rays are collected by a magnifying glass to a focus .",
    "if we had created the special construction for the vicinity of the focus in which the paper smoulders , then the experimenter could ask why the experiment gives a smooth picture of transition in the double logarithmic coordinates and the indices are preserved far away from the smouldering small vicinity of the focus . in the present case , the smouldering paper can be compared with the small area of opalescence ( drastic fluctuations near the critical point ) for which a separate theory was constructed . at the same time , the special function defining the point within the wave theory ( like the weber function ) can be continued quite smoothly to a much wider domain in which the paper does not smoulder . in the opinion of ivanov ,",
    "this fact is much more important than the fact that wilson s theory gives the index 4.82 rather than 4.3 , which is given by modern experiments .",
    "can the experimental index 4.3 be explained in principle in the framework of the conception presented by the author ?    whereas in classical mechanics there is no dependence on the planck constant @xmath318 , in classical thermodynamics there is a slow dependence of the viscosity on @xmath275 and @xmath7 , and thus _ vice versa _ as well . in our picture , the `` stretching '' of @xmath319 and @xmath21 in the experiment for real gases ( figs .  7 and  8) is greater than in the van der waals model , which enables us to introduce in the `` stretching '' the parameter @xmath320 ( i.e. , @xmath321 ) and obtain the index @xmath322 for @xmath323 .",
    "thus , in principle , the answer can be `` yes . ''",
    "it follows from what was said above that new critical indices arise only due to quantization of the conjugate pairs @xmath220 and @xmath324 .",
    "thus , the relationships between intensive quantities can be taken classical , because everything is carried out under the assumption of infinitely small viscosity . in this case",
    ", one can also pass to another coordinates , to the pressure and density .",
    "write , as usual , @xmath325 in the classical case , we have ( @xcite , p.  344 ) @xmath326 in the classical case , we obtain @xmath327    in the tunnel quantum case , we obtain @xmath328 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , p.  356 ) in the limit as @xmath286 , and thus not precisely ( the stretching is not taken into account ) .",
    "this is obtained for the van der waals model quantized in the tunnel way .",
    "an important specific feature of wiener quantization is that , at the expense of viscosity , it smoothes the acute angle on the graphs  8 and  9 , and thus removes the discrepancy between the theory and the experiment .",
    "the heuristic role of viscosity when penetrating through the barrier is described in sec .",
    "as is well known , an exponential penetration through the barrier occurs in the standard quantization as well .",
    "however , in the wiener quantization , we restrict ourselves to a power - law approximation ( see sec .  6 below ) .    if @xmath329 , then an uncertainty principle arises .",
    "let us proceed with the consideration of this principle .",
    "thus , in the case of wiener quantization , the main operators are not the momentum operator @xmath330 and the operator of multiplication by @xmath313 , but the heaviside operator @xmath331 and the operator of multiplication by @xmath313 .",
    "the constant @xmath282 was determined in  @xcite as viscosity .",
    "in contrast to the plank constant , the constant @xmath282 can smoothly depend on the variables of the system .",
    "the main distinction of the tunnel quantization from the euclidean and usual quantization is that it is considered up to @xmath332 , where @xmath87 is any fixed number , i.e. , it is factorized in @xmath332 .",
    "but first it is necessary to define the space where these operators act .",
    "as is well known , the heaviside operator is related to the two - sided laplace transform .",
    "this was shown already by van der pol and bremmer in  @xcite .",
    "introduce a family of functions @xmath333 to which we shall apply the two - sided laplace transform , namely , @xmath334 and thus these functions themselves are one - sided laplace transforms , @xmath335 for @xmath336 .",
    "denote by @xmath337 the two - sided laplace transform , @xmath338    if the functions @xmath339 are compactly supported and infinitely differentiable , then the closure of the operator  @xmath340 with respect to this domain can be carried out in the bergman space .",
    "then the functions @xmath341 here become analogous to the @xmath342-functions in the schrdinger quantization .",
    "moreover , @xmath343 , because these functions are real - valued .",
    "let us note first of all that the squared function or , equivalently , the squared dispersion @xmath344 of the operator @xmath345 is @xmath346 and , since @xmath345 is not selfadjoint , the function @xmath347 need not be positive , and hence one must pass to its absolute value . therefore , the corresponding theorem for generic operators fails to hold in general .",
    "however , for the operators @xmath340 and @xmath313 on a reduced function space , we obtain @xmath348 it can readily be seen that weyl s proof ( which is presented in the comments to  16 of chap .",
    "ii in  @xcite ) can easily be transferred to the operators @xmath340 and @xmath313 in the above function space .",
    "let us note some consequences of tunnel ( or wiener ) quantization for the `` quantum '' bose gas .    a specific feature of photon gas , which is mentioned in  @xcite , ",
    "62,63 , is that the number of particles in this gas , @xmath41 , is a variable quantity ( rather than a given constant , which is the case for ordinary gas ) .",
    "thus , since the number of particles @xmath41 in thermodynamics is conjugate to the chemical potential , it follows that , if the number of particles is undefined , then the chemical potential can be given precisely , @xmath176 , under the assumption that @xmath14 and @xmath41 are tunnel quantized and the uncertainty principle holds .    a contradiction between the conception of the author and the conception of physicists going back to einstein is also removed . in the case of a gas for which @xmath41 is fixed",
    ", we have @xmath349 according to the relation in  @xcite , and the chemical potential @xmath14 can be a small positive quantity .",
    "this is obvious , because @xmath350 ; however , this contradicts einstein s original conception claiming that @xmath351 .",
    "this contradiction is removed if the relationship of the uncertainty principle holds for @xmath14 and @xmath41 , because , if @xmath176 , then @xmath41 can take infinite values as well , and therefore the case @xmath352 is impossible .",
    "thus , it can be said that both the scaling hypothesis and the hypothesis of tunnel quantization do not agree near the critical point with the old thermodynamical conception of the four potentials .",
    "however , the hypothesis of tunnel quantization does not contradict the conception of the four potentials , namely , the hypothesis complements the conception , and this works not only near the critical point but also on the entire domain `` gas  liquid '' by agreeing with the maxwell rule and by removing logical discrepancies in bose gas theory .",
    "we have explained wiener quantization , which enabled us to remove some problems .",
    "let us now also explain the second quantization .",
    "the principal element in fock s approach is the indistinguishability of particles .",
    "in our theory , it follows from the original axiom .",
    "although there are no natural hilbert spaces here , in contrast to quantum mechanics , we can still obtain correct distinguished representations and limits as @xmath353 ( see  @xcite , chap .  1 , appendix  1.a ) and then , in view of the indistinguishability of particles , perform the second quantization of classical theory by introducing the creation and annihilation operators . certainly , this is possible only under the condition of the _ principle of indistinguishability of particles in our measurements _ , which follows from the main axiom , rather than from the `` identity principle '' introduced in  @xcite .    in classical mechanics ,",
    "such operators were introduced in  @xcite and @xcite on the basis of the schnberg concept ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the contemporary derivation of the vlasov equation is obtained by applying the method of second quantization for classical particles  @xcite . in this case , as @xmath120 , one obtains a system for which the creation and annihilation operators asymptotically commute , @xmath354 where @xmath355 is an external field and @xmath356 is the pairwise interaction .    if one replaces @xmath357 and @xmath358 by the operators of creation and annihilation @xmath359 and @xmath360 in the fock space , then , after this change , system   becomes equivalent to the @xmath41-particle problem for the newton system .",
    "however , according to the mathematical proof , this can happen only for the case in which the classical particles are indistinguishable ( from the point of view of the main axiom ) .    only in this case",
    "the projection from the fock space to the @xmath361-dimensional space of @xmath41 particles gives _ precisely _ the system of newton equations .",
    "note that the substitution @xmath362 reduces system to the form @xmath363 we have here @xmath364    the first equation of system   is the _ vlasov _ equation ( see  @xcite ) , where @xmath7 stands for the distribution function and @xmath365 for the dressed potential ( see sec .  2 , formulas  ff . ) ; the other equation is linear , and its meaning is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "note further a tunnel - quantum jump of the index at the points of the spinodal of the liquid phase .",
    "the classical index of the spinodal is equal to 2 , namely , @xmath366 , similarly to turning points in quantum mechanics .",
    "the airy function corresponds to it .",
    "similarly to   , we obtain @xmath367    the solution @xmath304 of the burgers equation can be evaluated by the formula  . as @xmath368 , after the change @xmath369 , we obtain @xmath370 in our case , the momentum @xmath304 is the volume  @xmath38 . hence , similarly to the consideration between the formulas   and , we obtain @xmath371 , and the index at the points of",
    "the spinodal becomes equal to three .",
    "it is possible that an experimenter , when considering the approaching of the critical isotherm for @xmath372 to the critical point @xmath373 , moves ( due to the indeterminacy principle ) towards increasing values of  @xmath41 , and hence towards increasing density , and arrives at the spinodal of the liquid phase .",
    "this effect is similar to the accumulation of the wave crest which overturns afterwards ( a part of the particles outruns the point of creation of the shock wave ) . in this case , the critical index 4.3 passes to the index 3 of the spinodal ( and this index occasionally coincides with the classical index of the critical point ) .",
    "this passage , which is described by the vlasov equation , was experimentally noticed in  @xcite and in other works .",
    "therefore , the experiments of ivanov  @xcite and wagner  ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) , where the modifications of the critical index @xmath122 from 4.3 to 3 were obtained when approaching the critical point , do not contradict our conception .",
    "for the creation of dimers , the author of the present paper used the creation and annihilation operators for pairs of particles and referred to it as the ultrasecond quantization  @xcite .",
    "experimenters do not distinguish between dimers either , counting only their number ( for example , as showed by calo  @xcite , the presence of 57% dimers leads to the appearance of a cluster cascade ) .",
    "thus , we discover new relations , namely an extension of the program `` partitio numerorum '' in number theory , from the point of view of the notion of hartley entropy , and indicate possible generalizations of quantization , which lead to an extension of the heisenberg indeterminacy principle  @xcite .",
    "ultrasecond quantization leads to thermodynamics in nanocapillaries and enabled us to obtain the superfluidity of liquids in nanotubes  @xcite@xcite , which was confirmed in experiments ( see  @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "first , we use the wiener quantization of thermodynamics to explain why , in sec .  5 ,",
    "the model of incompressible liquid was used to derive the condition @xmath374 , where the constant is independent of the temperature .",
    "because of the bachinskii relation on the zeno line , the incompressible liquid model leads to a rigid relation between the density ( concentration )  @xmath7 and the temperature .",
    "since the value of @xmath41 is undefined for @xmath176 ( i.e. , the concentration @xmath7 is undefined ) , the temperature is also undefined , and hence , according to the indeterminancy principle , the entropy takes a constant value and can be determined .",
    "( in addition , we note that , for @xmath176 , the activity is equal to  @xmath375 at any ( undefined ) temperature ) .",
    "this precisely means that @xmath374 .",
    "as we shall see below , the value of this constant is uniquely determined by the new critical point at which the liquid passes into `` foam '' ( dispersion state ) .",
    "the value of this point also determines the constant @xmath193 in the definition of @xmath182 , and hence , after calculating @xmath376 , it is possible to obtain the complete description of the distribution function for the gas branch in thermodynamics .",
    "we note that the indeterminancy at the spinodal point agrees with the results of experiments on the absolute instability of the spinodal point , which were performed by academician skripov and his school .",
    "now we pass to negative @xmath68 .    as is known , the bose ",
    "einstein distribution is obtained as the sum of terms of an infinitely decreasing geometric progression .",
    "if the progression is bounded by the number @xmath41 , then the potential is of the form @xmath377    what is the relationship between @xmath378 and @xmath194 ?",

    "@xmath383 here @xmath384    by  , @xmath385 and thus @xmath386 for @xmath387 .    as was proved in  @xcite@xcite ,",
    "passing to the limit in the euler ",
    "maclaurin formula , we obtain @xmath388 in particular , for @xmath389 , @xmath390 the absolute value of the derivative of the integrand can readily be estimated by using the identities presented below . by the euler ",
    "maclaurin bounds , this shows that one can pass from the sums of the form   to the corresponding integrals with the accuracy needed here .    hence , denoting @xmath391",
    ", we obtain the following formula for the integral at @xmath176 : @xmath392 where @xmath393 .",
    "this implies that @xmath394    we obtain @xmath395 write @xmath396 after the change @xmath397 , we obtain @xmath398 since @xmath399 after denoting @xmath400 we can write @xmath401 hence , @xmath402    since @xmath403 is the number of particles , @xmath404 , and @xmath405 , it follows that @xmath406 for @xmath215 is the value of the riemann zeta function , @xmath407 .",
    "therefore , @xmath408 increases for @xmath409 , and the first term of the right - hand side of equation   can be neglected . introducing the function @xmath410 we see that the compressibility factor @xmath411 is subjected to a flexion  from @xmath215 to @xmath254 .    in this case",
    ", we obtain another critical point , which fully corresponds to the physical meaning ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if the compressibility factor is negative , then we divide @xmath412 by @xmath413 with @xmath386 rather than by @xmath275 , because @xmath414 i.e. , the energy evaluated for a single particle at @xmath176 ( at the `` degeneration '' point ) , for @xmath415 , is proportional to @xmath416 , i.e. , to the temperature taken to a power with an exponent less than one . for @xmath415 ,",
    "the compressibility factor becomes a dimensional quantity ; however , this is always considered in this very way on curves in the space@xmath417 when using the van der waals normalization  .",
    "we write @xmath418 for @xmath386 and @xmath176 we have @xmath419 since the function @xmath420 decreases monotonically , we have @xmath421 ( the nazaikinskii inequality ) .",
    "thus , the spinodal point @xmath271 is determined by the relation @xmath422 where @xmath210 is the riemann zeta function .    for the critical isotherm we have @xmath423 .",
    "hence @xmath424 .",
    "for the point @xmath425 and the isochor @xmath426 we obtain the relation for @xmath427 from the equation @xmath428 the less @xmath425 , the greater @xmath429 .",
    "but @xmath271 can not exceed  @xmath375 , because the pressure and @xmath68 become @xmath430 at this point .",
    "the negative pressure at the point of the spinodal of liquid phase ( for @xmath431 ) is equal to @xmath432 , where the value of @xmath271 obtained above is negative . the condition @xmath433 bounds the transition region for the temperature @xmath434    for a model we can consider thick rubber with many small slots ( see appendix in  [ 33 ) , which is almost incompressible in compression , and because of the holes  slots , has a small young modulus in tension .",
    "it is natural to consider tension of a liquid as the appearance of nanoholds , i.e. , of negative energy @xmath33 , which can be treated as negative pressure ( pressure of the holes ) .",
    "let us now present a graph fig .  9 for negative pressure for the lennard ",

    "when considering a gas mixture , we would like to attract the attention at the following fundamental point .",
    "as is well known , in statistical physics and thermodynamics , the energy is sometimes connected with the number of degrees of freedom and the temperature ; for example , this is the case in the equidistribution law .",
    "it turns out in this case that the energy depends on the temperature and on the number of degrees of freedom and does not depend on the mass .",
    "the sequential usage of this conception gave us a continuous parameter @xmath194 related to the fractal dimension in the momentum space . continuing the use of this conception in the case of a mixture of pure gases",
    ", we should speak of concentration rather than on density , i.e. , we should neglect the masses of miscible pure gases .",
    "the sequential application of number theory in thermodynamics , i.e. , the consideration of the main axiom for the gas mixture ( which was in fact made by experimenters , at least in the case of air ( see  @xcite ) ) , leads to the formulas presented below .",
    "if two values @xmath436 and @xmath437 expanded into sums of @xmath438 and @xmath439 summands , respectively , correspond to the fractional dimensions  @xmath440 and  @xmath441 , respectively , and the values of the pairs @xmath442 and @xmath443 are on the `` verge of degeneration , '' i.e. , adding an excessive number to @xmath438 and to @xmath439 leads to the `` appearance of the bose condensate , '' then , for the sum @xmath444 and for @xmath445 , any adding of an excessive number to @xmath445 also leads to the `` appearance of the bose condensate . ''",
    "let @xmath446 and @xmath447 be the critical concentrations ( ( in the units @xmath448 ) ) , and let @xmath438 and @xmath439 be proportional to the molar concentrations , @xmath449 since @xmath450 for @xmath451 , it follows that , dividing the equation @xmath452 by @xmath453 , we obtain the relation @xmath454 where @xmath455 , the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the first and second gas of the mixture , and the subscript @xmath456 refers to the gas mixture .",
    "similarly , @xmath457 and , using the additivity of the entropy and dividing by @xmath458 , we obtain the relation @xmath459    it follows from the above two relations that the quantity @xmath460 almost linearly depends also on the values @xmath152 and @xmath461 .",
    "this fact is well known as `` kay s rule '' in the phenomenological theory of mixtures . for air , we have @xmath462 , whereas @xmath463 for oxygen ( 20% in air ) and @xmath464 for nitrogen ( 80% in air ) .",
    "the value of @xmath465 coincides with the value of this quantity evaluated according to the above formulas up to the accuracy of @xmath466 .",
    "he have defined @xmath467 for ideal gases , and hence also @xmath468 for gas mixtures .",
    "for a mixture of real gases , we must define the function @xmath469 .",
    "it turns out that , for such mixtures , the zeno - line is not a segment of a straight line , which is the case and is observed experimentally for pure gases .",
    "therefore , for a mixture , it is not sufficient to find the values @xmath470 and @xmath471 .",
    "one must also define the function @xmath472 .",
    "this can be carried out by using the following formulas .",
    "we are interested only in the values of @xmath473 and @xmath474 that correspond to the zeno - line of each of the gases ( see  - ) .    since",
    ", by assumption , the critical point belongs to the domain of homogeneity , it follows that the concentrations @xmath152 and @xmath475 are preserved , and hence , using equations ( 61)(63 ) , we obtain the following equation for the sum of the entropies , where @xmath476 : @xmath477 where @xmath478 is equal to the ratio @xmath479 .    recall that the values of @xmath480 and @xmath481 are taken according to the zeno - lines of the first and the second gas , respectively .",
    "hence , using the given values of @xmath194 , @xmath440 , and @xmath441 obtained from , we find the value @xmath482 , which defines the function @xmath483 by the relation  .",
    "this enables us to define the dependence of @xmath465 for a mixture of real gases .",
    "for the liquid phase , we consider the quasi - ideal case of incompressible liquid . then , for the sum of entropies , we obtain the relation @xmath484          this means that , integrating over all @xmath194 and taking the variation of  , we obtain the condition of chemical equilibrium , @xmath490 this implies a relationship between the chemical potentials , as in the law of mass action .",
    "a similar formula holds for a mixture of a greater number of components .",
    "let us now consider a small correlation sphere for the liquid state of a homogeneous mixture of pure substances ( as a rule , these are 68 molecules ) and consider all possible replacements of molecules of the gas 1 and the gas 2 in this sphere .",
    "let us form an analog of stoichiometric coefficients , as if these were `` chemical bonds . ''",
    "now using the relations for chemical potentials , we obtain a system of necessarily many equations for the original molecules , as it happens for the law of mass action for the original atoms .",
    "this enables us to define the mean concentration of each of these two gases in the liquid phase .",
    "note that it is not rigorously proved in the cycle of papers of the author that to any `` pure '' gas there corresponds a zeno - line .",
    "as is known , for example , the ideal line is substantially curved for water under low densities .",
    "water ( the creation of dew ) , as well as mercury , must be excluded from our theory of real gases and their mixtures .",
    "we have heuristically obtained the zeno - line only for the lennard ",
    "jones interaction potential .",
    "the same heuristic proof can be carried our for other interaction potentials .",
    "therefore , one can agree that , for pure gases interacting according to the same potential , the zeno - line is approximately a line segment ( and this segment is not quite straight in the problem in sec",
