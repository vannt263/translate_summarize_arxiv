    "the effects of the electromagnetic environment on electric transport has been a subject of extensive theoretical and experimental interest in recent years .",
    "the reasons for interest are varied , as are the systems for which studies of the effects of the environment have been performed .",
    "recent interest in quantum computation@xcite has prompted interest in the effects of dissipation on decoherence rates in superconducting qubits.@xcite double quantum dots have been used to study the effects of the environment on inelastic tunneling rates,@xcite and have been proposed as detectors of high - frequency noise produced by mesoscopic devices.@xcite finally , interest in quantum phase transitions@xcite has prompted study of the effects of dissipation on superconducting systems such as thin films@xcite and josephson junction arrays.@xcite    given the possibility of using a single cooper pair box@xcite as a qubit and its similarity to the superconducting single - electron transistor ( s - set),@xcite it seems logical to use the s - set as a model system for studying the effects of environmental dissipation on coherence and transport in small tunnel junction systems .",
    "recently , there have been several such attempts , motivated by experiments in which a josephson junction array was fabricated in close proximity to a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in an gaas / al@xmath5ga@xmath6asheterostructure,@xcite which can be used as a tunable source of dissipation .",
    "( while the effects of a mechanically tunable environment were earlier studied in the macroscopic quantum tunneling regime,@xcite use of a 2deg allows more flexible tuning of the environment over a larger impedance range . ) in place of an array , we and the berkeley group have instead used similar fabrication techniques to couple an s - set to a 2deg.@xcite in one instance , the focus was on transport at higher biases , in the regime of the josephson - quasiparticle cycle.@xcite in the others , the focus instead was on the low bias regime and the tunneling rates of cooper pairs.@xcite theoretical work aimed at an explanation of the results of the berkeley group was undertaken by wilhelm , _",
    "et al._@xcite    the primary experimental difference between our own work and that of the berkeley group lies in the way in which the environment is varied .",
    "the berkeley group followed an approach developed earlier for the study of junction arrays,@xcite using a gate on the back side of the substrate to vary the sheet density @xmath7 of the 2deg , and therefore its resistance per square @xmath8 .",
    "such a change is global , and affects the 2deg not only immediately beneath the s - set , but beneath the macroscopic leads used to measure it as well . in our own work , by placing au gates on the surface of the sample near the s - set itself , we were able to vary the dissipation in the 2deg locally , while leaving 2deg beneath the leads virtually unchanged.@xcite    the berkeley group compared their results to the theory of wilhelm , _",
    "et al . _ , which predicted that within linear response the conductance @xmath9  of the s - set would scale with the ground plane conductance @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 as @xmath12",
    "while the berkeley group did observe power law behavior , their measured exponents were not in quantitative agreement with theory .",
    "furthermore , the measured @xmath13 depended on @xmath11 and @xmath14 on @xmath15 , calling the scaling form into question .    in our own",
    "work,@xcite we examined a somewhat more complex model for the environment than that considered by wilhelm , _",
    "et al . _",
    "specifically , we allowed for coupling of electromagnetic fluctuations to tunneling cooper pairs due simultaneously both to the s - set leads and to the 2deg in the immediate vicinity of the s - set , which is coupled to the s - set central island via a capacitance @xmath16 . by also allowing for averaging of the s - set offset charge , we were able to obtain good agreement between our measurements and calculations .",
    "here we examine our model of the environment in somewhat more detail , provide additional experimental data which supports our earlier analysis , and also give some additional details of the calculation .",
    "our samples consist of an @xmath17-based s - set fabricated in close proximity to a 2deg formed in a gaas / al@xmath5ga@xmath6as  heterostructure@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ sample ] below .",
    "we begin by fabricating six au gates which can be used to deplete the electrons beneath them by application of a negative gate voltage @xmath18 . at the center of the au gates",
    "we then fabricate our s - set , as can be seen in the electron micrograph ( expanded view in fig .  [ sample ] ) .",
    "note that as shown in the larger diagram the s - set leads extend over the 2deg to macroscopic contact pads .",
    "for the vast majority of their length they are well away from the au gates and the 2deg beneath them is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "when we apply a gate voltage @xmath18  to all six au gates , the electrons immediately beneath them are depleted , leaving a small pool of electrons beneath the s - set .",
    "this pool is connected to the rest of the 2deg ( held at ground ) only by two quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) with conductances @xmath19 ( assumed equal ) as shown in the micrograph .",
    "it is also capacitively coupled to the s - set island through a capacitance @xmath16  as shown in the lower right inset to fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "when all six au gates are energized as described above , we say that the electrons are confined in the `` pool '' geometry .",
    "we do not refer to the pool as a quantum dot since for these experiments the qpcs are sufficiently open that no coulomb oscillations are detected in the pool and discrete energy levels have not formed .    because the au gates can be biased independently",
    ", we can also apply @xmath18to only the four outermost gates which form the qpcs .",
    "as before , the electrons beneath the s - set are coupled to ground through the qpcs .",
    "in addition , however , they are now coupled through a resistance @xmath20  to two large reservoirs of electrons located between the four outermost gates , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "the reservoirs are in turn coupled to ground only through a capacitance @xmath21 .",
    "when only the four outer gates are energized , we say that the electrons in the 2deg are confined in the `` stripe '' geometry .",
    "we observe significant differences between the measured s - set conductance @xmath9  versus applied gate voltage @xmath18  for the two different geometries , as will be discussed below .",

    "[ sample ] .",
    "the set island is connected to its leads through junctions with resistance @xmath25 and capacitance @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the s - set leads present an impedance @xmath22  to the set while the 2deg electrons have a total impedance @xmath23  to ground which is coupled to the set through the capacitance @xmath16 .",
    "nearly the entire length of the set leads is far from the au gates , so that @xmath22  is almost completely unaffected by the gate voltage @xmath18 . the electrons immediately beneath the set are strongly affected by @xmath18 so that @xmath23will in general be a function of @xmath18 , and may also depend on the configuration of gates used ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , on the pool versus stripe geometry ) . finally , the set is also coupled to the au gates by a capacitance @xmath24 .",
    "we neglect the possibility of a substantial impedance on the gate lines largely because @xmath27 is by far the smallest capacitance in the problem .",
    "furthermore , any gate impedance would be substantially reduced since there are six gates whose impedances would combine in parallel .",
    "this general model ( excluding the small gate capacitance @xmath24 ) has been investigated previously,@xcite but without considering any particular form for the impedances @xmath22  and @xmath23 .    in table",

    "to proceed , we need accurate models of @xmath22  and @xmath23 ; we begin by considering @xmath22 .      since our leads are fabricated above the 2deg , which acts as a ground plane , it is appropriate to model them as transmission lines.@xcite the most general form for the impedance @xmath51 of a lossy transmission line terminated in a load @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the characteristic impedance of the line , @xmath55 its complex propagation constant and @xmath56 its length .",
    "at the relatively low frequencies ( @xmath57 ) considered here , it is reasonable to ignore the inductive reactance of the line and treat it as a simple @xmath58 line with a resistance and capacitance per unit length @xmath59and @xmath60 .",
    "doing so , we have that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . looking out at the line from the sample ,",
    "the line termination @xmath52 is provided by the bias circuitry , which typically presents a low impedance @xmath63 . for simplicity",
    "we therefore take @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ lleq ] ) , and obtain the resulting approximation @xmath65 which we take as the basic form for the impedance of a finite @xmath58 line .",
    "this form has been considered previously in the context of incoherent tunneling of cooper pairs in individual josephson junctions.@xcite    while this is likely a fairly accurate description of the impedance of a section of our leads , when used in evaluating the kernel @xmath40 in ( [ koteq ] ) it leads to integrals which are analytically intractable .",
    "fortunately a further simplification is possible .",
    "we are interested in the low energy part of @xmath0 , which we expect from ( [ peeq ] ) to be dominated by the long time behavior of @xmath40 , which is in turn dominated by the low frequency part of the impedance @xmath66 .",
    "we therefore expand eq .",
    "( [ zrceq ] ) around @xmath67 to obtain @xmath68 as a reasonable approximation to @xmath66  in the interesting limit .",
    "another common treatment@xcite of the @xmath58 transmission line problem is to consider an infinite @xmath58 line , whose impedance is given by @xmath61 .",
    "unlike the finite @xmath58 line , for which the impedance @xmath66  approaches a constant @xmath69 at @xmath67 , the infinite @xmath58 line has a @xmath70 singularity at @xmath67 which dominates the long - time limit of @xmath40 and therefore @xmath0 .",

    ", a high - temperature expansion must be performed instead.@xcite      having developed a model for @xmath22 , we now consider a model for @xmath23 .",
    "the particular model will depend on the geometry we choose .",
    "for an unconfined 2deg , the simplest choice is that @xmath23  is ohmic with an impedance related to @xmath8  of the 2deg : @xmath72 . when the electrons are confined in the pool geometry ,",
    "they are coupled to the remaining 2deg by two qpcs with conductance @xmath19 ( assumed equal ) , which appear in parallel from the vantage point of the set .",
    "there is likely some shunt capacitance @xmath73 as well , but the associated roll - off frequency @xmath74 is typically large ( @xmath75 ) and we therefore neglect it .",
    "so for the pool geometry , we take @xmath76    the stripe geometry is more complex . here , in addition to the qpc conductances , the electrons beneath the set are coupled to two large electron reservoirs with resistance @xmath20  located between the outermost au gates . at their narrowest ,",

    "when @xmath23  alone is increased , the peak current drops and the voltage at which the peak occurs increases ; at the same time , current at higher biases increases .",
    "this reflects broadening of @xmath183 as @xmath23  is increased , and a higher probability of inelastic processes .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath289alone is increased , the current decreases at all bias voltages , and the voltage at which the maximum current appears is more or less fixed .    in order to obtain good agreement with experiment , we must include both variations in @xmath289  and @xmath23 , as shown in fig .",

    "overall the theory agrees with the experimental results quite well ( apart from an overall scaling factor ) , reproducing the initial rise in current with no shift in peak current position , followed by a reduction in current and an outward shift in peak position .",
    "the agreement is poor only for @xmath334 , for which the experimental current is too large in relative terms .",
    "even here , however , the shape of the @xmath3-@xmath4  curve is reproduced nicely .",
    "additional data ( not shown ) indicates that the s - set current does usually drop sharply for large @xmath23 , so that the amplitude of this particular @xmath3-@xmath4  curve is probably anomalously high .",
    "overall , the agreement between our experimental results and calculations seems quite good , particularly for @xmath296 and @xmath115 .",
    "the good agreement of @xmath287  and @xmath9  for those temperatures , combined with the accurate predictions of our model for the evolution of the @xmath3-@xmath4characteristics gives us confidence that our model , despite its complexity , accurately describes our experimental system .",
    "in particular , it is clear that both the lead impedance and any impedance which is coupled directly to the s - set island must be included to give accurate results . in our particular case",
    ", charge averaging appears to play an important role when the confinement of the 2deg is reduced , either for less negative @xmath18  or when the stripe geometry is used .",
    "overall , this improved understanding indicates that s - set/2deg systems can be used to test the accuracy of the standard environmental theory in a way which was not previously possible",
    ".    generally speaking , the model of the environment presented in ( [ rezteq ] ) should be applicable to any system consisting of an s - set and its leads fabricated above a 2deg , including that of the berkeley group .",
    "the model also gives a simple explanation for the lack of agreement between the experimental results of the berkeley group and the scaling theory of wilhelm , _",
    "et al . _",
    "since neither the leads nor the 2deg can be ignored , @xmath183 must be a convolution of @xmath349 and @xmath350 . in that case ,",
    "our own calculations indicate that the power law behavior described in wilhelm , _",
    "_ , does not survive the convolution .",
    "the resulting dependence of @xmath9  on @xmath15  does however resemble power law behavior over a limited range of @xmath15 , with an exponent which can vary with temperature .",
    "whether charge averaging effects are important in the berkeley system is unclear to us at this time .",
    "the most significant puzzle associated with our own work is the sudden disagreement between theory and experiment between @xmath296 and @xmath303 . while it is clear that the perturbative expression for the tunneling rates in eq .",
    "[ gameq ] has a low temperature bound for applicability , it is unclear why theory and experiment disagree at @xmath303 for _ all _ @xmath351 .",
    "this disagreement , as well as the continued reduction in current for temperatures below @xmath303 is suggestive either of a limitation in the environmental theory , or that some other physics is beginning to dominate at the lowest temperatures .",
    "note that while @xmath23  becomes relatively large , the impedance seen by the junctions never becomes much larger than about @xmath352 at any frequency since both @xmath353 and @xmath168 are relatively small , so that we are still in the low impedance limit @xmath354}}<{\\ensuremath{r_{q}}}$ ] .",
    "difficulties with the environmental theory in this impedance range could be of great importance to potential quantum computation applications .",
    "finally , we do not believe that coulomb blockade physics in the 2deg is likely to be of importance , since the qpc conductances are still quite high even for the smallest values of @xmath15 ; coulomb blockade oscillations do not begin to appear in the 2deg until both qpcs have a conductance below @xmath355 .",
    "it is straightforward to propose experiments which could address these issues .",
    "the simplest would be to perform more measurements like those in fig .",

    "( such measurements were unfortunately not performed for s1 ) .",
    "one could also simplify the analysis significantly by constructing samples in which the 2deg is selectively removed beneath the leads . in that case , the leads would no longer act as transmission lines , and would present a small impedance to the tunneling electrons , so that in all probability only @xmath15  would be of importance .",
    "we can also imagine reducing the coupling capacitance @xmath16  so as to reduce the effective environmental impedance and keep the s - set current relatively large even for large @xmath23",
    ". this could be particularly useful if the 2deg is further confined so as to form a quantum dot , in which case the s - set could be used to probe the dot impedance and energy level structure .",
