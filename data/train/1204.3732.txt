    "oh ( 1720mhz ) masers associated with supernova remnants are unambiguous indicators of interaction with adjacent molecular clouds ( frail , goss & slysh 1994 ) .",
    "the relative ease of identifying supernova remnant - molecular cloud interaction sites relative to other methods , such as searching for molecular gas that is kinematically disturbed or chemically processed ( e.g. denoyer 1979a , b ; wootten 1981 ) motivated surveys of the galaxy for more examples ( frail et al 1996 ; yusef - zadeh et al 1996 ; green et al 1997 ; koralesky et al 1998 ; yusef - zadeh et al 1999a , b ; sjouwerman & pihlstrm 2008 ) , which have found that approximately 10% of galactic supernova remnants have 1720mhz masers and are therefore interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "oh absorption from atca observations of snr w28 ( green , wardle & lazendic 2000 ) , overlaid on the locations of bright oh(1720 mhz ) maser spots ( claussen et al .",
    "1997 ) , and contours of co j=10 and j=32 emission ( arikawa et al .",
    "1999 ) tracing unshocked and shocked gas , respectively .",
    "( adapted from arikawa et al .  1999 ) ]    the masers are collisionally pumped in warm , dense molecular gas with densities and temperatures in the range 50125k , @xmath3@xmath4 and oh column densities @xmath0@xmath5 ( elitzur 1976 ; lockett , gauthier & elitzur 1999 ) .",
    "these conditions are not met in gas overrun by standard `` j - type '' shock waves which dissociate molecules : although molecules reform as the shocked gas cools ( e.g.   hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) , cooling is so rapid that the oh column that is produced in the relevant temperature range is too small ( lockett , gauthier & elitzur 1999 ) . instead the molecular shock must be `` c - type''(mullan 1971 ; draine 1980 ) , in which heating and compression of the gas within the shock front is achieved by magnetically - driven ion - neutral collisions .",
    "the low fractional ionisation of the molecular gas means that this process is relatively slow , yielding a broad shock front with an extended warm tail .",
    "however the requisite oh column is still higher than predicted by standard c - type shock models which rapidly convert oh into water ( draine , roberge & dalgarno 1983 ; kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) .",
    "instead an additional agent , such as x - rays or cosmic rays associated with the supernova remnant , is needed to dissociate water into oh as the gas cools behind the shock , ( wardle 1999 ) .",
    "the clear association of 1720mhz masers with shocked gas ( see e.g.  fig . [",
    "fig : w28 ] ) , underpinned by a theoretical production mechanism hinging on molecular shock waves , provides a firm basis for assuming that the presence of these masers signals the existence of a shock wave driven by a supernova remnant into an adjacent cloud ( wardle & yusef - zadeh 2002 ) .",
    "this has been confirmed by follow - up studies of individual remnants .",
    "a good illustration of this is provided by the supernova remnant g349.7 + 0.2 , about which little was known apart from its having a radio continuum shell and four oh(1720 mhz ) masers . a search for co ( j=10 ) emission from an adjacent molecular cloud ,",
    "h@xmath6 ( v=10 ) emission at @xmath7 from shocked molecular gas , and oh absorption associated with the masers found all three ( lazendic et al .  2010 ) .",
    "the population of 1720mhz - bearing supernova remnants show other hallmarks of interaction .",
    "for example `` mixed - morphology '' remnants are characterised a radio shell , or partial shell , filled with centrally - peaked emission in soft thermal x - rays ( long et al .",
    "1991 ; rho & petre 1998 ) believed to be provided by the evaporation of dense interstellar gas in the interior of the remnants ( white & long 1991 ; cox et al .",
    "there is a strong statistical association between remnants hosting 1720 mhz masers and mixed - morphology remnants ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2003 ) , and also with those with associated gamma - ray sources ( hewitt et al .",
    "2009 ) , which are likely produced by interactions of cosmic - rays accelerated in the remnant with the neighbouring molecular gas .",
    "apart from signalling locations where remnants are driving shock waves into molecular clouds , 1720mhz masers are important probes of the interaction .",
    "the masers require significant columns of shocked molecular gas and good velocity coherence , and so tend to occur on the limbs of supernova remnant shells at velocities close to the systemic lsr velocity of the remnant , allowing distance estimates based on models of galactocentric rotation .",
    "follow - up zeeman observations at 1720 mhz have determined that the magnetic field in the post - shock gas is @xmath83 mg ( claussen et al 1997 , 1999 ; brogan et al 2000 ; hoffman et al 2005 ) .",
    "the post - shock magnetic field acts as the piston driving a c - type shock wave , and a field of this strength provides sufficient post - shock pressure needed to drive a shock at 25@xmath9 into gas of density @xmath10 , so these measurements provide an important sanity check on the basic picture .",
    "in addition the magnetic field measurements provides a good estimate of the pressure in the interior of the supernova remnant that is driving the shock into the molecular cloud .",
    "while 1720 mhz masers are invaluable in pinpointing where supernova remnants interact with molecular clouds , their absence does not imply that an interaction is _ not _ occurring . instead",
    ", one or more of the physical conditions required to collisionally invert the 1720 mhz transition may simply be absent  a sufficient column of oh , or line - of - sight velocity coherence within the oh column .",
    "additional indicators of such interactions would therefore be useful .",
    "the 1720 mhz inversion dies away for oh columns @xmath11 due to photon trapping , but under similar physical conditions the analogous 6049mhz transition in the first rotationally - excited state of oh becomes inverted ( pavlakis & kylafis 2000 ; mcdonnell , wardle & vaughan 2008 ) .",
    "this prompted searches for masers at 6049mhz associated with supernova remnants using parkes ( mcdonnell , wardle & vaughan 2008 ) , effelsberg ( fish , sjouwerman & philstrom 2007 ) and the atca ( mcdonnell 2011 ) ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these searches targeted snr with 1720mhz masers , mixed - morphology , or other evidence of interaction ( note that there is substantial overlap between the snr in the parkes & effelsberg and parkes & atca searches ) , but all were unsuccessful .",
    ".searches for 6049 mhz masers [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath12 p = parkes , e = effelsberg , a = atca",
    "an alternative possibility is that the treatment of overlapping spectral lines in the oh excitation calculations is at fault .",
    "line overlap in oh occurs even for velocity widths of order @xmath13 because of the small splitting of the rotational levels arising through lambda doubling and hyperfine splitting .",
    "this enables photons emitted in one infrared transition between sub levels of different rotational states in one oh molecule to to be absorbed by a transition between different sub - levels in the same pair of rotational rates .",
    "this tends to scramble the level populations within the upper or lower pairs of sub levels inside each rotational level and suppress population inversion in the 1720 and 6049mhz transitions , quenching the masers .",
    "line overlap is at present treated _ locally _ in the oh excitation code , i.e.  the oh - bearing cloud is treated as a uniform slab with a velocity width that is everywhere the same .",
    "its effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the maser optical depth as a function of oh column density in a uniform slab when overlap is neglected . in this case ,",
    "line optical depths ( ie .  photon escape probabilities ) scale as @xmath14 so the curves simply shift to the right as @xmath15 is increased .",
    "the right hand column shows the effect of including local line overlap : once the line width exceeds @xmath16 , line overlap starts to shuffle the populations within rotational levels and the inversions are suppressed .     and",
    "@xmath17k as the total ( thermal + micro - turbulent ) fwhm line width is increased : @xmath18 ( _ solid _ ) , @xmath19 ( _ long - dashed _ ) , @xmath20 ( _ short - dashed _ ) , @xmath21 ( _ dotted _ ) .",
    "the upper and lower panels show the results obtained neglecting or including local line overlap , respectively ( see text ) .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] ]    observed 1720mhz maser lines have @xmath22 , at which point local line overlap would suppress the masers , so this treatment overestimates the effect of line overlap .",
    "in reality the oh column does not have a single , uniform , velocity profile throughout ",
    "instead , the column of oh has local line widths that are much smaller than the net velocity width created by the systematic velocity gradient along the line of sight .",
    "this situation requires a `` non - local '' treatment of line overlap effects , in which photons emitted by an infrared transition are absorbed in a neighbouring transition at a different layer in the slab ( e.g.  doel , gray & field 1990 ) .",
    "this form of overlap is less effective , potentially enabling the 1720mhz line to remain inverted for larger ( @xmath23 ) line widths ; the 6049mhz line however , may then only be weakly inverted at column densities @xmath24 .",
    "resolution of this will have to await calculations including non - local overlap .",
    "the lack of detected oh(6049mhz ) masers in the snr searches conducted to date may be attributed to a combination if two factors .",
    "first , the oh column densities inferred from gbt observations may be systematically overestimated because of the tendency for oh absorption to overlay regions where the background continuum is brightest .",
    "if the continuum has structure within the beam the optical depth ( and so the oh column ) will tend to be overestimated , as appears to be the case in 3c391 and w44 .",
    "however , ic443 clump g appears to have a column density @xmath25 , more than twice that estimated from the single - dish observations .",
    "therefore several additional remnants listed in table  1 may still have oh column densities exceeding the @xmath24 threshold suggested for 6049mhz inversion .",
    "second , non - local line overlap might suppress 6049mhz inversion more effectively than the 1720mhz transition , or simply push the threshold oh column density required for significant maser amplification to columns exceeding @xmath25 .",
    "we thank jack hewitt for providing his 1720 mhz vla data ."
