    "in this paper the 1-dimensional unfolding problem will be addressed . here the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath0 of an experimentally measured characteristic @xmath1 in general differs from the true physical pdf @xmath2 because of the limited acceptance ( probability ) @xmath3 to register an event with true characteristic @xmath4 and finite resolution in the response function @xmath5 , the probability to observe @xmath1 for a given true value @xmath4 .",
    "formally the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is given by @xmath6 the integration in ( [ p1_main ] ) is carried out over the domain @xmath7 of the variable @xmath4 . in practical applications the experimental distribution",
    "is usually discretized by using a histogram representation , obtained by integrating @xmath0 over @xmath8 finite size bins @xmath9 with @xmath10 the bounds of bin @xmath11 .",
    "if a parametric ( theoretical ) model @xmath12 for the true pdf is known , then the unfolding can be done by determining the parameters in a least squares fit to the binned data @xcite or a maximum likelihood fit to the unbinned data . in both cases",
    "the a priori information which is needed to correct for the distortions by the experimental setup is the fit model , which allows to describe the true distribution by a finite number of parameter values .",
    "model independent unfolding to identify a physical distribution , as considered in @xcite , is an underspecified problem and every approach to solving it requires a priori information about the solution .",
    "different methods differ , directly or indirectly , in the use of this a priori information .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] a new method for solving the unfolding problem will be presented .",
    "properties of the algorithm are discussed in section [ sec : discuss ] and illustrated in section [ sec : example ] by applying it to a numerical example proposed in @xcite and also used in refs.@xcite .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to solve the unfolding problem ( [ p1_main ] ) the following ansatz for @xmath2 will be used @xmath13 where the true distribution is written as an offset @xmath14 plus a weighted sum of @xmath15 kernel functions ( pdfs ) @xmath16 , with non - negative weights @xmath17 , central locations @xmath18 and a scale parameter @xmath19 which determines the width of the kernel .",
    "kernels are widely used for the estimation of a pdf @xcite as well as in non - parametric regression analysis @xcite . note that eq.([repres ] ) uses only kernels of one type with a common scale parameter .",
    "the only difference between different kernels is the location of the center . in this paper",
    "we will only consider this simplified case . in principle",
    "the approach could be generalized to vary also functional form and scale parameter .    using eq.([repres ] ) to parametrize the solution @xmath2 reduces the unfolding problem of finding a solution from the infinitely many dimensional space of all functions to finding a solution in a finite dimensional space . this way a discretization",
    "is performed which , in contrast to e.g. a discretization by a histogram , has the advantage to introduce negligible quantization errors for sufficiently smooth distributions .    the following discussion will focus on symmetric kernels , although , depending on the kind of problem one attempts to solve , also asymmetric kernels may be appropriate .",
    "the a priori information of @xmath2 being proportional to a pdf is incorporated by accepting only positive weights .",
    "the scale parameter of the kernel functions acts as a regularization parameter which allows to adjust the smoothness of the result .",
    "weights , locations and the number of kernel functions needed to estimate @xmath2 will be determined by the unfolding procedure described below .    below examples of smooth symmetric kernels",
    "@xmath20 are presented .",
    "all kernels are pdfs which are normalized to unity when integrating over @xmath4 . for convenience , in all cases",
    "the variable @xmath21 is used . with the indicator function",
    "@xmath22 a class of polynomial kernels is defined by @xmath23 often used are the following special cases :    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath24{unfold_2012av.eps } &   \\hspace * { -1.6cm}\\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_2040av.eps}\\\\ \\vspace*{-1.1cm}\\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_err_2012.eps } &   \\hspace * { -1.6 cm } \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_err_2040.eps}\\\\ \\vspace*{-1.65cm}\\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_17512av.eps } &   \\hspace * { -1.6 cm } \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_17540av.eps}\\\\ \\vspace*{-1.1cm}\\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_err_17512.eps } &   \\hspace * { -1.6 cm } \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_err_17540.eps}\\\\ \\vspace*{-1.65cm}\\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_1512av.eps } &   \\hspace * { -1.6 cm } \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_1540av.eps}\\\\                     \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_err_1512.eps } &   \\hspace * { -1.6 cm } \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{unfold_err_1540.eps } \\end{array}$ ]    the behavior of the global characteristics using 12 or 40 bins for the unfolded distribution is shown in fig.[fig : globfom ] .",
    "the behavior in both cases is very similar .",
    "the plots show how with increasing scale parameter @xmath19 , i.e. stronger regularization , statistical errors decrease while the bias increases .",
    "adding both contributions in quadature , the total root mean square error shows a minimum around @xmath25 , i.e. in the region also favored by the cross - validation approach for the determination of @xmath19 .    .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.5% ] .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.5% ]",
    "a new method for unfolding the true distribution from experimental data is presented .",
    "the unfolding problem is known as an ill - posed problem which can not be solved without some a priori information about solution .",
    "smoothness and positiveness are examples for this type of information . in the proposed algorithm",
    "the unknown true distribution is represented as a weighted sum of smooth kernels .",
    "the scale parameter of the kernels acts as a regularization parameter allowing to adjust the smoothness of the result .",
    "a cross - validation approach is proposed to determine an optimal value of this parameter .",
    "the method avoids discretization of the integral equation which is often done by unfolding methods and is an additional source of bias for the solution of unfolding problem .",
    "various criteria were discussed to gauge the quality of the unfolding result .",
    "the methods provides a solution for the unfolding problem with a non - singular error matrix which can be used to test the consistency of a theoretical prediction with the experimental data .",
    "a numerical example including extensive simulation studies of the statistical properties of the method was presented to illustrate and to validate the procedure . for the example typical execution times per unfolding were found to be around 0.1s on a 2 ghz cpu .",
    "the method can be extended to deal with steeply falling spectra or multidimensional distributions and to handle properly the case of limited statistics in the determination of the response function .",
