    "the term dynamical casimir effect  ( dce ) is used nowadays for a rather wide group of phenomena characterized by creation of quanta from the initial vacuum state of some field due to time - dependent variations of the geometry or material properties of a macroscopic or mesoscopic system ( see book , vdodonov , revdal , nori , camop - me for recent reviews ) . in particular , cavity dce @xcite denotes the process of photon generation from the electromagnetic vacuum ( and other initial states ) in cavities due to the motion of some wall or the time - modulation of the material properties ( e.g. , dielectric permittivity or conductivity ) of the wall or a medium inside the cavity @xcite .",
    "an analog of cavity dce was recently implemented experimentally in the solid state architecture known as circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit qed @xcite ) , where a josephson metamaterial was embedded in a low - q microwave cavity , permitting the modulation of the cavity effective length via external magnetic field meta .",
    "although cavity dce has been studied theoretically for more than four decades , some aspects of this phenomenon are still not completely clear .",
    "a particular issue we approach here is the asymptotic behavior of photon generation : while some models predict the saturation of the intra - cavity photon number @xcite , other predict exponential photon growth even in the presence of moderate dissipation diss1,diss2,diss3,diss4,diss5,diss6 .",
    "this controversy can be resolved by constructing a full microscopic model for the interaction between the quantized electromagnetic field and moving or time - modulated objects constituted of individual atoms .",
    "some steps along this line were taken in @xcite , yet the majority of studies employs time - varying boundary conditions for the cavity field to bypass the complicated light ",

    "we utilize the general mathematical description of nonstationary circuit qed systems formulated recently in @xcite to develop a microscopic toy model for cavity dce .",
    "our study is motivated by the following intuition : since the boundary conditions are just a mathematical artifact to manage the interaction between photons and a large number of atoms , dce should ultimately originate from the basic form of light ",
    "matter interaction with nonstationary parameters .",
    "so we consider the special case of cavity dce implemented with a dielectric slab having externally prescribed motion and material properties .",
    "the slab is portrayed as an ensemble of @xmath1 two - level atoms with unspecified transition frequencies and coupling strengths that interact with the field via the standard dipole hamiltonian with time - dependent parameters @xcite .",
    "we use the time - independent boundary conditions to quantize the cavity field in a standard manner , while the interaction between the arbitrarily modulated atoms and photons is treated microscopically .    after cumbersome calculations we arrive at simple mathematical expressions that generalize the common dce description in single - mode cavities bound2,zeilinger .",
    "in particular , we express the photon generation rate in terms of the microscopic parameters , show that the photon growth and amount of squeezing are limited due to effective kerr nonlinearity and point out that cavity dce occurs even for a single atom .",
    "moreover , we discuss how external classical pumping can significantly enhance the photon generation from vacuum for suitable choices of the pump phase @xcite .",
    "since our model is quite general , we also apply it to situations where all the system parameters are known , such as a cloud of cold polar molecules polar1,polar2 or superconducting qubits @xcite .",

    "the annihilation and creation operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 do not depend explicitly on time , so the vacuum state defined as @xmath6 @xcite is the same for all times , unlike the case of a cavity with moving walls for which the field state depends on the instantaneous frequency @xcite .",
    "we consider a small dielectric slab located at an arbitrary position within the cavity , as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the dielectric slab is subject to pre - determined motion with small amplitude , and its material properties ( e.g. , dielectric permittivity ) can be adjusted externally by some bias ( represented by the laser beam in the figure ) . from the microscopic point of view , this problem corresponds to a predetermined motion of an atomic cloud whose internal properties are modulated externally . for consistency , the generation of photons from vacuum in this particular example of dce should be contained intrinsically within any formulation of the light ",
