    "the issue of equivalence of covariant perturbation theory and light front hamiltonian perturbation theory has attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "it is important to establish equivalence between the two approaches as light front field theory has `` spurious '' divergences not present in covariant perturbation theory and it is necessary to understand how these are generated in order to establish a correspondence between light front expressions and the covariant expressions .",
    "one of the approaches consists of establishing equivalence at the feynman diagram level wherein the covariant expression for a feynman diagram is integrated over the light cone energy , @xmath0 , to generate all the diagrams of light front perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "_ etal _ @xcite have given a general algorithm for proving equivalence in theories involving scalars as well spin -@xmath1 particles .",
    "equivalence at feynman diagram level in yukawa theory has been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "correspondence between light - front hamiltonian approach and the lorentz - covariant approach has been discussed for qed @xmath2 and also for qcd by bosonization of the model @xcite .",
    "as far as @xmath3 dimensional theories are concerned , equivalence of lfqed and covariant qed in coulomb gauge has been proved within the framework of feynman - dyson - schwinger theory @xcite .",
    "however , not much work has been done on proving equivalence for qed at the feynman diagram level . in a previous work",
    "@xcite we had addressed the issue of equivalence of light - front qed , @xcite and covariant qed at the feynman diagram level . in @xcite , we have shown how one can obtain all the propagating as well as instantaneous diagrams by performing the @xmath0 - integration carefully .",
    "the feature that sets qed apart from other cases considered in literature is the presence of diagrams involving instantaneous photon exchange .",
    "our previous study was aimed at generating these expressions in the diagram based approach .",
    "it was shown that the equivalence can not be established by performing @xmath0 integration if one uses the commonly used two term photon propagator in light cone gauge , @xcite : @xmath4 \\label{eq : prop1}\\ ] ]    however , if one uses the three term photon propagator term @xcite given by    @xmath5 \\label{eq : prop2}\\ ] ]    then one can generate the diagrams involving instantaneous photon exchange also which completes the proof of equivalence . in present work",
    ", we give an alternative proof of equivalence of covariant and lfqed at the feynman diagram level using the two term photon propagator .",
    "we will show that one can use the asymptotic method proposed by bakker _",
    "etal _ @xcite to generate the instantaneous photon exchange diagrams for one loop self energy correction .",
    "this method does not require the third term in the photon propagator .",
    "there has been some debate in literature over the relevance of the third term in the gauge boson propagator .",
    "it is usually dropped on the grounds that it does not propagate any information . in our previous work",
    ", we emphasized the importance of this term in proving equivalence at one loop level .",
    "the present work gives an alternative proof i.e. one without the need of the third term .",
    "however , it should not be considered as undermining the importance of this term . on the contrary , the present method , being an alternative to the three term propagator method",
    ", may be able to throw some light on the physical significance of this term .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : pertur ] , we summarize the one loop renormalization of lfqed @xcite and briefly review the work of @xcite for completeness . here",
    ", we present only those results of @xcite and @xcite which are needed for our discussion . in section  [ sec : sec3 ] , we consider self energy diagram and use the asymptotic method to generate graph involving instantaneous photon exchange . we will show that in a certain asymptotic limit , the covariant expression for fermion self energy reduces to a sum of expression for the instantaneous photon exchange graph and the ir singular terms of the propagating graph .",
    "we also carry out a similar analysis for vacuum polarization .",
    "since vacuum polarization does not have any contribution from instantaneous photon exchange vertex at one loop level , in this case the above mentioned limit reproduces only the ir singular terms in the propagating part . in section  [ sec : sec4 ] , we summarize and discuss our results . appendix a contains the notations and basics .",
