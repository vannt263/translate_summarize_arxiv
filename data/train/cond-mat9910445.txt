    "its structure exhibits a medium  range order in that it forms a disordered network of sio@xmath14tetrahedra leading to a peak in the static structure factor around @xmath15  @xmath4 @xcite . in recent years",
    "the high frequency dynamics of silica has been the subject of an intense debate because its raman and neutron scattering spectra @xcite show a so  called boson peak around @xmath16  thz , which is also present in many other glassformers but normally gives a less intense contribution to the spectra than in silica .",
    "this feature appears also in experiments as an excess over the debye density of states or , equivalently , over debye s @xmath17law in the specific heat around the temperature @xmath18  k @xcite .",

    ". therefore benassi _ et al .",
    "_  argued that the boson peak has its origin in these propagating sound modes .",
    "in contrast to this suggestion , vacher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found evidence from the available spectroscopic data that the boson peak is due to the strong scattering of acoustic modes by the disorder thus regarding the boson peak as a manifestation of these strongly scattered modes .",
    "simple models have been suggested to explain the origin of the boson peak . from the soft potential model @xcite the idea",
    "is put forward that anharmonic localized vibrations coexist with propagating high frequency sound modes in the frequency range around the location of the boson peak . in the case of silica",
    "these anharmonic soft modes have been related to coupled sio@xmath14-tetrahedra librations @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have analyzed their neutron scattering data of silica within the soft potential model , and have concluded that the sound waves are indeed scattered from such local vibrational modes below @xmath16  thz , whereas above this frequency static rayleigh scattering from the atomic disorder takes place .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied a system of coupled harmonic oscillators with a random distribution of force constants . in this model",
    "they have found an excess over the debye behavior in the density of states which they have interpreted as an analogon to the boson peak feature in real structural glasses . in agreement with this model ,",
    "sokolov @xcite proposed that the boson peak is related to the strong scattering of acoustic like vibrations by fluctuations of the elastic constants .    a feature which shares many properties with the boson peak is also found within the mode  coupling theory ( mct ) of the glass transition : in the ideal glass state where all particles are trapped in the cages formed by their neighbors , the spectrum of the density  density correlation function is a superposition of harmonic oscillator spectra which is due to the variety of cages in which the particles are trapped @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable in this context that the whole light scattering spectra of glycerol , including the boson peak , have been successfully described within a schematic mct model @xcite , and very recently gtze and mayr have shown that deep inside the glass state , i.e. at temperatures well below the mct temperature @xmath20 , the theory predicts dynamical features which are very reminiscent to the boson peak  @xcite .    in the last three years md simulations tried to give insight into the vibrational dynamics of silica @xcite , and other network forming glasses like zncl@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "most of these investigations have analyzed the dynamics within the harmonic approximation , i.e. by determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the diagonalized dynamical matrix .",
    "although the full information of the vibrational part of the dynamics is given by the eigenmodes ( of course only within the harmonic approximation ) the origin of the boson peak remains a puzzle .",
    "one reason for this is the smallness of the system sizes ( @xmath22@xmath23   ) which have been used in the forementioned studies , which has the effect that parts of the boson peak are missing ( see below ) .",
    "a second reason is the difficulty of analyzing the boson peak feature in terms of eigenmodes since , as we will discuss in detail below , in the case of silica the coupling of modes with different @xmath9 is essential for this feature .    in order to avoid these problems we use in the present work a large system size and calculate the exact current and density correlation functions in order to investigate their dependence on wave  vector @xmath9 and frequency @xmath13",
    "therefore , we are able to study the temperature dependence of the high frequency dynamics of silica in the liquid state as well as in the glass state .",
    "moreover , we are able to give insight into the relationship between the vibrational dynamics and structural relaxation in the silica melt .",

    "the values of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be found in the original publication .",
    "the coulombic part of the potential was evaluated by means of ewald sums for which further details can be found elsewhere @xcite . in recent simulations",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the bks potential ( [ bkspot ] ) reproduces many static and dynamic properties of real silica very well and thus it can be considered as a reliable model for this material .",
    "we have simulated a system with @xmath30 ions .",
    "the size of the simulation box was fixed to @xmath31    corresponding to a density of @xmath32  @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the smallest wave  vector of our simulation has magnitude @xmath34  @xmath4 . in order to study finite size effects",
    "we have done also simulations for smaller systems , and the details of these simulations are given below . in the following we will investigate the fully equilibrated liquid state at @xmath35  k , @xmath36  k , and @xmath37  k and the glass state at @xmath38  k , @xmath39  k , and @xmath40  k. in the liquid state we equilibrated the system first at each temperature in the nvt ensemble at each temperature , and after that we started microcanonical simulations by means of the velocity form of the verlet algorithm . during the equilibration the temperature was kept constant by using a stochastic collision algorithm . the time step we used was 1.6  fs , and in order to improve the statistics we simulated at each temperature two independent runs . at @xmath41",
    "k the length of the equilibration runs was 13 million time steps followed by the microcanonical production runs over 12 million time steps , which corresponds to a real time of 20  ns . during the two production runs we have stored on a linear time scale 30 configurations each which have subsequently been used as the starting configuration of a new simulation for investigating the high frequency dynamics .",
    "we mention that the pressure at @xmath41  k is around 0.9  gpa .",
    "further details on the simulation of the liquid state can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the starting ",
    "point for producing the glass state were two equilibrated configurations at @xmath42  k at which the equilibration time was 4 million time steps ( 6.5  ns real time ) . by coupling the system to an external heat bath the temperature",
    "was then decreased linearly in time within one million time steps to 0  k. this corresponds to a cooling rate of about @xmath43  @xmath44 . during the cooling procedure we stored configurations at the temperatures mentioned above which we used as starting configurations in order to anneal the system for @xmath45 time steps at constant temperature .",
    "afterwards we propagated the system over @xmath45 time steps in the microcanonical ensemble and stored configurations every @xmath46 time steps .",
    "thus at the end we had at each of the three temperatures in the glass state 22 starting configurations for the investigation of the high frequency dynamics . the pressure for our glass structures is 0.52  gpa at @xmath47  k , 0.69  gpa at @xmath48  k , and 0.8  gpa at @xmath38  k.    in this paper we are mainly interested in frequency dependent correlation functions .",
    "therefore time fourier transformations have to be calculated which we have done by means of the wiener  khinchin theorem .",
    "it says that the fourier transformation of a correlation function @xmath49 ( @xmath50 : density , longitudinal current , transverse current ) is given by the power spectrum @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the fourier transform of the time series @xmath50 .",
    "the time series were transformed via fast fourier transformation whereby we applied a welch window function @xcite .",
    "usually we have calculated the time series for the density and the currents over 8192 time steps ( @xmath53  ps real time ) by using the aforementioned starting configurations .",
    "this results in a frequency resolution of about @xmath54  thz .",
    "the reliability of the fourier transformation was tested by calculating also time series over 16384 time steps and in these test cases we have found indeed identical spectra , at least for @xmath55  thz .",
    "in this section we analyze the vibrational features of our silica model by means of the longitudinal and transverse current correlation function @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , which depend on the magnitude of the wave  vector @xmath56 and the frequency @xmath13 .",
    "these are defined as @xcite @xmath57 where the longitudinal part ( @xmath58 ) and the transverse part ( @xmath59 ) of the total current @xmath60 are given by @xmath61    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows @xmath1 and @xmath2 for different values of @xmath9 up to @xmath62  @xmath4 at the temperature @xmath41  k. we have plotted only the functions for the oxygen  oxygen correlations because the silicon  silicon and the silicon  oxygen correlations exhibit qualitatively the same behavior , which is reasonable for such small wave  vectors .",
    "note that even at the relatively high temperature @xmath41  k , our sio@xmath21 model is quite viscous having a viscosity of about @xmath63  p , and moreover , that this temperature is well below the critical temperature of mode  coupling theory , which is at @xmath64  k @xcite .",
    "thus within the framework of mct we are indeed probing the system deep in the glass regime . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we show @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the frequency range between 0.4 and 1.6 thz for the four lowest @xmath9 values of our simulation , @xmath34  @xmath4 , @xmath65  @xmath4 , @xmath66  @xmath4 , and @xmath67  @xmath4 . at @xmath34",
    "@xmath4 we recognize that there are two peaks , corresponding to the longitudinal and the transverse part of the current , which are well separated from each other . for increasing wave",
    " vectors these peaks move to higher frequencies whereby their width becomes so large that they overlap more and more with each other . in the following we call the excitations corresponding to these peaks high frequency longitudinal acoustic ( la ) modes and high frequency transverse acoustic ( ta ) modes , respectively . from the figure we see that the ta excitations give the most important contribution to the current spectra in",
    "that their amplitude is about a factor @xmath68@xmath69 higher than that of the la excitations . in the wave ",

    "@xmath4 we observe in @xmath1 for the o  o correlations , apart from the la peak around @xmath68  thz , a peak around @xmath73  thz corresponding to an optical excitation .",
    "moreover , the intensity of the whole spectrum seems to be enhanced in that the la and the optical peak sit on top of a flat background .",
    "if @xmath9 is increased to @xmath74  @xmath4 the la peak moves to larger frequencies whereby a shoulder around @xmath75  thz gets more and more pronounced .",
    "also at @xmath11  @xmath4 there is a la peak but now its position has moved back to @xmath76  thz , i.e.  a smaller frequency than at @xmath77  @xmath4 . in the case of the si  o correlations ( fig .",
    "[ fignew2]b ) the essential difference to the o  o correlations is the negative amplitude of the la peak for @xmath78  @xmath4 which indicates an antiphase motion of the silicon and oxygen atoms .",
    "the curves for the si ",
    "si correlations ( fig .",
    "[ fignew2]c ) show essentially only one difference compared to those for the o  o correlations in that the optical band has a higher weight in the spectrum than the la excitations .",
    "this is due to the fact that the silicon atoms are bonded stronger in the tetrahedral network than the oxygen atoms , and thus on small length scales more localized motions have a higher weight in the case of the silicon atoms which corresponds to frequencies in the optical band .    also in the transverse case for the o  o correlations ( fig .",
    "[ fignew2]d ) the whole spectrum sits on top of a flat background .",
    "the intensity of the ta peak around @xmath79  thz decreases with increasing @xmath9 whereas there is an increase in the intensity around 9  thz . as a result",
    "a broad flat band is obtained for @xmath80  thz .",
    "in contrast to the o  o correlations , @xmath2 for the si  o correlations ( fig .  [ fignew2]e ) shows a strong overall decrease of the intensity if @xmath9 is increased from @xmath62  @xmath4 to @xmath10  @xmath4 .",
    "this can be easily understood because at @xmath11  @xmath4 the current correlation functions measure to a great extent the single particle motion , and therefore the relative motion of the silicon and oxygen atoms gives only a small contribution to the spectra .",
    "the most remarkable feature in @xmath2 for the si ",
    "si correlations is again that , compared to the o  o correlations , the optical excitation around 20  thz has a larger amplitude than those of the acoustic band for @xmath81  @xmath4 . the essential result which is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fignew2 ] is that for intermediate values of @xmath9 the whole spectrum is placed on top of a flat background .",
    "a similar feature has also been found by mazzacurati _",

    "@xcite in a lennard  jones system .",
    "these authors have identified the flat background directly in the spectra and in the participation ratio which measures the number of particles that contribute to the eigenmodes at a certain frequency . at the low frequency edge of the density of states",
    "the participation ratio has values expected for localized modes .",

    "one can interpret the flat background as the contribution of multiphonon excitations .    by reading off the peak maxima @xcite in @xmath1 and @xmath2 corresponding to the longitudinal and transverse acoustic modes one gets dispersion like branches @xmath82 and @xmath83 which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a for @xmath41  k and in fig .",

    "thus , @xmath85 can be interpreted , in analogy to crystals , as a quasi brillouin zone .",
