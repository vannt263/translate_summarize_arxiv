    "<S> nematic order resulting from the partial melting of density - waves has been proposed as the mechanism to explain nematicity in iron - based superconductors . an outstanding question , however , is whether the microscopic electronic model for these systems  the multi - orbital hubbard model  displays such an ordered state as its leading instability . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to usual electronic instabilities , such as magnetic and charge order , this fluctuation - driven phenomenon can not be captured by the standard rpa method . here , </S>",
    "<S> by including fluctuations beyond rpa in the multi - orbital hubbard model , we derive its nematic susceptibility and contrast it with its ferro - orbital order susceptibility , showing that its leading instability is the spin - driven nematic phase . </S>",
    "<S> our results also demonstrate the primary role played by the @xmath0 orbital in driving the nematic transition , and reveal that high - energy magnetic fluctuations are essential to stabilize nematic order in the absence of magnetic order .    </S>",
    "<S> the elucidation of electronic ising - nematic order @xcite  the state in which electronic degrees of freedom spontaneously lower the point - group symmetry of the system  has become an important problem in unconventional superconductors @xcite . in both pnictides </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and cuprates @xcite , the experimentally observed nematic order has been proposed to arise from the partial melting of an underlying spin density - wave ( sdw ) @xcite or charge density - wave ( cdw ) @xcite stripe - order . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is based on robust symmetry considerations . </S>",
    "<S> consider for concreteness the stripe sdw case : the ground state has an @xmath1 degeneracy , with @xmath2 denoting the direction of the magnetic order parameter in spin space , and @xmath3 denoting the selection of the sdw ordering vector @xmath4 or @xmath5 ( in the cdw case , the system has an @xmath6 degeneracy ) . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in layered systems suppress the continuous ( @xmath2 or @xmath7 ) and the discrete ( @xmath3 ) symmetries differently , favoring an intermediate regime in which only the @xmath3 symmetry is broken @xcite . because the @xmath3 symmetry distinguishes between two ordering vectors related by a @xmath8 rotation , its breaking implies a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transition , and therefore nematic order .    </S>",
    "<S> although this mechanism for spin - driven ( or charge - driven ) nematic order has been established in simplified low - energy models for pnictides @xcite and cuprates @xcite , it remains hotly debated whether more realistic microscopic models display nematic order as the leading electronic instability . </S>",
    "<S> the cuprates , a sensible microscopic model is the single - band hubbard model , whose phase diagram has been reported to display nematic correlations in the strong - coupling regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the pnictides , due to the @xmath9 configuration of fe and to the small crystal field splittings , a five - orbital hubbard model , including hund s rule interactions , is a more appropriate starting point  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , because many pnictides display metallic behavior , a weak - coupling analysis of this intricate model can reveal important information about the underlying physics of these materials . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , conventional rpa approaches have been employed to study the onset of sdw , cdw , and ferromagnetism . however , in contrast to these usual electronic instabilities , the standard rpa approach does not capture the nematic instability even qualitatively , as we show below , making it difficult to assess whether the realistic multi - orbital hubbard model has a tendency towards nematic order .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we extend the standard rpa approach and derive the nematic susceptibility of an arbitrary multi - orbital hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations included in this formalism arise solely from the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian , such that interactions are treated at the same order as in the typical rpa method . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this formalism to the case of sdw - driven nematicity in iron pnictides , and establish that the leading instability of the five - orbital interacting model is a spin - driven nematic phase for a wide range of parameters . in general , we find that nematic order exists in a narrow @xmath10 range above the magnetic transition line , in agreement with experiments in the pnictides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , magnetic fluctuations at higher energies can induce a sizable splitting between the two transitions , particularly in the regime where the sdw transition is suppressed to zero . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this effect may be relevant to understanding the unusual nematic phase of fese @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previously , the investigation of the multi - orbital hubbard model in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite revealed the importance of the orbital content of the fermi surface in the low - energy spin - nematic model of the pnictides . here </S>",
    "<S> , we find from the orbitally - resolved nematic susceptibility that whereas the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath0 orbitals contribute almost equally to the sdw instability , the @xmath0 orbital plays a stronger role in driving the nematic instability . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the nematic susceptibility with the rpa - derived ferro - orbital order susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> work provides a promising route to search for nematicity in different compounds , as it is compatible with _ ab initio _ approaches and also with methods that include the effects of moderate interactions , such as lda+dmft @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the multi - orbital hubbard model with onsite interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - interacting part is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 creates an electron with momentum @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 at orbital @xmath17 and the hopping parameters @xmath18 are determined from tight - binding fits to _ ab initio _ calculations ( sums over spin and momentum indices are left implicit ) . </S>",
    "<S> the four onsite interaction terms correspond to the intra - orbital hubbard term , @xmath19 , the inter - orbital hubbard term , @xmath20 , the hund s rule coupling , @xmath21 , and the pair - hopping term @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients are related by @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> previous approaches considered the nematic susceptibility of a spin - fermion model @xcite ; here , we will focus on the hubbard model within rpa . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism in which nematic order arises from the partial melting of an sdw or a cdw requires fluctuations at two momenta related by @xmath8 , in general @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with integer @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> although our formalism can be extended in a straightforward way to arbitrary @xmath27 , hereafter we focus on @xmath28 . to make contact with the pnictides </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the sdw channel . </S>",
    "<S> performing a hartree - fock decoupling of @xmath29 in both the @xmath30 charge channel and the @xmath31 sdw channel : @xmath32 where @xmath33 incorporates the changes in the mean - field densities and @xmath34 are the sdw order parameters with @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction matrix @xmath36 is @xmath37 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider only intra - orbital magnetism , since previous hartree - fock calculations revealed that in the ground state the intra - orbital sdw order parameters are the dominant ones @xcite . in the standard rpa approach for the sdw instability , the electronic degrees of freedom are integrated out , yielding the quadratic magnetic free energy :    @xmath39 & = & \\sum_{q , i = x , y}\\left[\\chi_{i}^{\\mu\\nu}(q)\\right]^{-1}{\\mathbf{m}}_{q,\\mu}^{i}\\cdot{\\mathbf{m}}_{-q,\\nu}^{i}\\,,\\label{eq : second_order_free_energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the magnetic propagator @xmath40 @xmath41^{-1}\\,,\\label{eq : mag_susc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the green s function in orbital basis , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the matsubara frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the rpa magnetic susceptibility @xmath46 is proportional to and diverges at the same temperature as the magnetic propagator @xmath40 . note that the tetragonal symmetry of the system implies that a peak of @xmath40 at @xmath4 will be accompanied by an equal peak at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at this order in perturbation theory , the system does not distinguish the case in which either @xmath47 or @xmath48 is selected ( single-*q * order ) from the case in which both are selected ( double-*q * order ) , i.e. the standard rpa approach is blind to nematicity . to remedy this problem </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : nematic_and_magnetic_instabilities ] , @xmath89 is nearly featureless and @xmath10-independent at low energies . ]    </S>",
    "<S> an important issue in obtaining this phase diagram is that , as shown in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : chi_bare_nem ] ) , the computation of the nematic susceptibility requires summing the magnetic fluctuations not only over the entire brillouin zone , but also over energy ( i.e. over matsubara frequencies ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the propagator @xmath90 is strongly peaked at @xmath86 ( see appendix [ app : freq_dep_mag_susc ] ) , within rpa it saturates to a finite value for large energies [ see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mag_susc ] ) ] , requiring a frequency cutoff @xmath91 . near a finite-@xmath10 magnetic transition , due to the very sharp peak in @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> , it is reasonable to take only the @xmath86 contribution  the low - energy magnetic fluctuations  resulting in the solid line of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase_diagram ] . however , near the region where @xmath93 , ignoring the high - energy magnetic fluctuations ( @xmath94 ) is not justified . to address this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a cutoff @xmath95 ev , at which the propagator reaches values close to its saturation value , as shown in appendix [ app : freq_dep_mag_susc ] . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding nematic transition line is shown as a dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase_diagram ] . near the regime where the magnetic transition takes place at finite @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> the only effect of the cutoff is to increase the nematic transition temperature , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , near the regime where @xmath93 , the nematic transition is stabilized even in the absence of long - range magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> although the precise value of @xmath76 depends on the cutoff value , the main result is that higher - energy magnetic fluctuations are essential to promote nematic order without magnetic order . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that , in fese , the only parent material in which nematic order is observed in the absence of magnetic order , nmr measurements find no evidence for low - energy magnetic fluctuations @xcite , whereas neutron scattering reports sizable fluctuations at modest energy values @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a remaining question is whether or not the spin - driven nematic instability is the leading instability of the system . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> an ongoing debate @xcite concerning iron - based materials is whether ferro - orbital order , signaled by an unequal occupation of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals , @xmath96 , could drive the nematic transition , instead of the spin - driven mechanism explored above . to investigate this issue </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the @xmath30 static component of the rpa orbital order susceptibility , @xmath97 for the multi - orbital hubbard model  @xcite , of which a brief derivation is included in appendix [ app : ferro_orb_order_susc ] . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase_diagram](b ) , our results reveal a nearly @xmath10-independent @xmath89 for the doping range and interactions investigated . </S>",
    "<S> this is not unexpected , since for reasonable values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , there is no attraction in the rpa charge channel . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , within rpa , ferro - orbital order is unable to drive the nematic instability . </S>",
    "<S> of course , once the coupling to magnetic fluctuations is included , which requires going beyond rpa , @xmath89 will diverge at the same @xmath10 as @xmath100 @xcite . in this regard , by effectively decoupling these two channels , rpa provides an interesting route to investigate which instability is the leading one  at least for weak or moderate interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we developed an appropriate extension of the rpa approach to obtain the orbital - resolved spin - driven nematic susceptibility of an arbitrary multi - orbital hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> application to the case of iron - based superconductors reveals that the leading instability of the system is an interaction - driven nematic phase . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 orbital plays a leading role in promoting the nematic instability , and higher - energy magnetic fluctuations are essential to stabilize nematic order in the absence of long - range magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with other rpa susceptibilities reveals that the nematic and magnetic transitions follow each other closely , and that the ferro - orbital susceptibility does not diverge on its own . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , our formalism can also be combined with first - principle approaches to search for other materials that may display electronic nematicity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , because interactions appear only in the determination of the magnetic propagator , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mag_susc ] ) , this formalism can be combined with other approaches that specifically include moderate electronic interactions , such as dft+u or lda+dmft @xcite .    </S>",
