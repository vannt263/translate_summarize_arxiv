    "there is a growing interest in ultracold atoms confined in time - periodically driven optical lattices .",
    "it was pointed out already in 1997 that a metal - insulator - like transition undergone by ultracold atoms in quasiperiodic optical lattices can be induced by changing the amplitude of a time - periodic driving force @xcite .",
    "but the field became truly active only 10 years later , after the unambiguous experimental observation of dynamical tunneling suppression with bose - einstein condensates , and even of driving - induced reversal of the sign of the tunneling matrix element , by the pisa group @xcite , and after related single - particle experiments performed with driven double - well potentials in heidelberg @xcite .",
    "several groups then have monitored the dynamics under the combined action of both a homogeneous time - independent and a time - periodic driving force , either with non - condensed cold atoms @xcite , or with bose - einstein condensates @xcite ; such dynamics may be viewed as an analog of photon - assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "the pisa group subsequently also reported the coherent control of the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition in shaken three - dimensional optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of spontaneous breaking of time - reversal symmetry with fast - oscillating triangular optical lattices by @xcite constitutes a further milestone in this line of research .",
    "moreover , photon - assisted tunneling in a strongly correlated bose gas has very recently been investigated , possibly allowing for applications to topological physics and quantum computing @xcite . also active control of correlated tunneling in ac - driven optical superlattices",
    "has been observed , providing a novel approach to the realization of @xmath0 spin models @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "several studies indicate promising future perspectives : @xcite have suggested to perform avoided - level - crossing spectroscopy with ultracold bose gases in strongly driven optical lattices , while @xcite have worked out a proposal for simulating frustrated quantum antiferromagnetism with oscillating triangular lattices .",
    "later @xcite have pointed out that a small periodic phase modulation of an optical lattice can give direct access to the system s conductivity .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have argued that ac forcing may even change the interparticle interaction from repulsive to attractive , thereby enabeling one to simulate an effectively attractive hubbard model with a temperature below the superconducting transition temperature .    on a first superficial glance ,",
    "ultracold atoms in shaken optical lattices , with shaking frequencies on the order of a few to tens of kilohertz , might appear as typical examples of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "but this naive view is not correct .",
    "quantum systems governed by a time - periodic hamiltonian possess a particular basis , consisting of floquet states , with respect to which one finds occupation numbers which remain _ constant _ in time , with the periodic time - dependence already being incorporated into the basis states themselves .",
    "thus , a weakly interacting quantum gas subjected to time - periodic forcing , and possibly exposed to some sort of noise , will be statistically characterized by a time - independent distribution of floquet - state occupation numbers .",
    "what is that _ equilibrium _ distribution ?    in the present tutorial article",
    "we develop this line of thought , and discuss experimental data , obtained with bose - einstein condensates in kilohertz - shaken optical lattices , which we interpret as evidence for floquet - based dynamics .",
    "we proceed as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : s_2 ] we review basic elements of the floquet picture , and speculate about the existence of analogs of the bose - einstein and the fermi - dirac distribution function for isolated , time - periodically driven quantum gases .",
    "we then turn in sec .",
    "[ sec : s_3 ] to the realization of periodically shaken optical lattices , extending the analysis of @xcite , and pay particular attention to the distinction between the co - moving frame of reference , in which the trapped quantum gas experiences a spatially homogeneous inertial force , and the laboratory frame , in which the measurements are performed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : s_4 ] we briefly introduce the driven bose - hubbard model @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : s_5 ] we calculate momentum distributions expected in time - of - flight absorption imaging for matter waves occupying a single floquet state .",
    "we consider two particular situations : an interacting gas periodically driven at high frequencies , and a noninteracting gas subjected to a force with arbitrary time - dependence . here",
    "we also point out certain characteristic differences between time - of - flight absorption images obtained from shaken lattices utilizing the inertial force , and the corresponding images acquired when the lattice remains at rest , while the force is exerted , _",
    "e.g. _ , through the harmonic modulation of a levitation gradient @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : s_6 ] we tie the various strands together and report our measurements , which suggest the existence of floquet condensates occupying the `` lowest '' available floquet state . while we consider only one comparatively simple experimental setting , it appears likely that our findings are of a more general nature . in the final sec .",
    "[ sec : s_7 ] we briefly spell out our main conclusions .",
    "the notion of bose - einstein condensation of an almost ideal gas @xcite appears to be inextricably linked to the energy eigenstates of some single - particle hamiltonian : when the temperature of a gas of weakly interacting bose particles becomes lower than a certain critical temperature , the gas `` condenses '' into the single - particle ground state , meaning that this ground state becomes macroscopically occupied .",
    "it might seem that this concept can not be applied to explicitly time - dependent systems , for which , in general , there are no stationary states .",
    "yet , there is one notable exception : if a single - particle hamiltonian @xmath1 is periodic in time , so that @xmath2 for some period @xmath3 , then floquet s theorem @xcite suggests the existence of a set of distinguished solutions @xmath4 , known as floquet states , to the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath5 ; these floquet states are in many ways analogous to the usual energy eigenstates of time - independent hamiltonian operators @xcite .",
    "they have the particular form @xmath6 where the functions @xmath7 inherit the period  @xmath3 of the underlying hamiltonian ; the index @xmath8 denotes a set of quantum numbers specifying the state .",
    "the quantities @xmath9 , which determine the phase factors accompanying the time - evolution of the floquet states  ( [ eq : fls ] ) in the same manner as energy eigenvalues of time - independent systems determine the phase factors expressing the evolution of their energy eigenstates , are dubbed quasienergies @xcite .    there is a compelling reason for considering these floquet states .",
    "namely , at each instant @xmath10 the set of floquet functions @xmath11 is complete in the physical hilbert space on which @xmath1 acts .",
    "hence , _ any _ solution @xmath12 to the time - dependent schrdinger equation admits an expansion of the form @xmath13 with _ time - independent _ coefficients @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , under conditions of perfectly coherent evolution the occupation probabilities @xmath15 of the floquet states remain constant , despite the periodic time dependence of the hamiltonian .",
    "these coefficients then keep a memory of how the system has been prepared , that is , how the time - periodic forcing has been turned on in the past , whereas the floquet states and their quasienergies are independent of this history .    if , however , the evolution is not coherent , but the system is in contact with some sort of thermal environment or heat bath , what would be the equilibrium distribution of the floquet - state occupation probabilities which establishes itself in the long run , irrespective of the particular initial condition ?",
    "an important step towards a general answer to this question has been taken by @xcite , who have studied anharmonic oscillators subjected to strong time - periodic forcing while being weakly coupled to thermal degrees of freedom provided by a surrounding , and who have shown that the corresponding quasistationary density matrix actually is diagonal in the floquet representation .",
    "this line of investigation has recently been taken up by @xcite , with a detailed view on the classical - quantum correspondence , after general aspects of such `` periodic thermodynamics '' had been discussed by @xcite .",
    "turning now from the single - particle dynamics to that of an ideal gas of identical quantum particles subjected to some periodically time - dependent external influence , such as a dilute gas of bose particles stored in a confining potential which is modulated periodically in time , an even more intriguing question poses itself : what are the statistics of the floquet - state occupation numbers ?",
    "in other words , what is the replacement for the familiar bose - einstein ( or fermi - dirac , when dealing with fermions ) distribution function in a periodically time - dependent setting ?    in order to appreciate what lies behind this question ,",
    "let us briefly retrace the steps which led @xcite to what is now known as bose - einstein statistics , by now having become basic knowledge of statistical physics @xcite : consider an isolated ideal bose gas consisting of @xmath16 particles possessing a total energy @xmath17 , being kept in some large confinement .",
    "in view of the corresponding denseness of the single - particle spectrum we divide the energy axis into small intervals , the @xmath18th such interval containing @xmath19 single - particle states with practically identical energy @xmath20 .",
    "we then denote the number of particles occupying the @xmath19 states in the @xmath18th interval as @xmath21 , and ask for the most probable set @xmath22 of these cell occupation numbers .",
    "all admissible sets @xmath23 obviously have to comply with the two constraints @xmath24 and @xmath25 the latter holding approximately , reflecting the above coarse - graining procedure , but to good accuracy .",
    "the number of microstates associated with a given set @xmath23 is @xmath26 = \\prod_i { n_i + g_i - 1 \\choose n_i } \\",
    "; , \\ ] ] because the binomial coefficients quantify the number of possibilities to distribute @xmath21 indistinguishable particles over @xmath19 states `` with repetition '' , as is characteristic for bosons .",
    "assuming that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and employing stirling s formula , one then obtains the entropy @xmath29 = \\sum_i \\left [        n_i \\ln\\left ( 1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i}\\right )      + g_i \\ln\\left ( \\frac{n_i}{g_i } + 1 \\right ) \\right ] \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : ent}\\ ] ] the searched - for most probable occupation numbers @xmath22 maximize this expression , subject to the two constraints  ( [ eq : pnc ] ) and ( [ eq : enc ] ) . introducing a lagrangian multiplier  @xmath30 to account for the conservation of the particle number , and a further multiplier  @xmath31 to account for the conservation of energy , we are thus led to the variational problem @xmath32 - \\alpha \\sum_i n_i      -\\beta \\sum_i n_i e_i   \\right)_{n_i = n_i^ * } = 0 \\ ; . \\label{eq : eva}\\ ] ] after brief calculation , this gives @xmath33_{n_i = n_i^ * } \\delta n_i = 0 \\;\\ ] ] and thus results in the bose - einstein distribution @xmath34 quantifying the most probable occupation number of an individual single - particle state with energy @xmath20 under microcanonical conditions .",
    "finally , the multiplier @xmath31 is identified with @xmath35 , with @xmath36 denoting boltzmann s constant and @xmath3 being the temperature of the gas , while @xmath37 is related to its chemical potential  @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "when trying to adapt this reasoning to time - periodically driven quantum gases , and to determine the corresponding floquet - state occupation numbers , we can immediately carry over the first constraint  ( [ eq : pnc ] ) : the sum of all occupation numbers has to equal the total number of particles .",
    "this may seem trivial , but it is not , because already here we are making essential use of floquet theory : it is only because the coefficients @xmath14 in the expansion  ( [ eq : fse ] ) are time - independent that we can assign occupation numbers to the floquet states ; only then can one ask for the associated distribution function .",
    "it is , however , not obvious what becomes of the second constraint  ( [ eq : enc ] ) , because energy eigenvalues do not exist for a time - periodic system , and the quasienergies of the floquet states can not be considered as their proper substitutes in this context . to understand the quasienergy concept more deeply , we insert the floquet states  ( [ eq : fls ] ) into the time - dependent schrdinger equation , and deduce @xmath39 the conspicuous notation employed here , _",
    "i.e. _ , writing the floquet functions @xmath40 with a double right angle instead of @xmath41 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fls ] ) , has a deep significance .",
    "namely , eq .  ( [ eq : eve ] ) has to be regarded as an _ eigenvalue equation _ for the quasienergies ; within the floquet framework , this eigenvalue equation takes over the role played for time - independent systems by the stationary schrdinger equation . unlike the latter , this quasienergy eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : eve ] ) lives in an _ extended hilbert space _ of @xmath3-periodic functions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the usual physical setting , in which `` time '' emerges as an evolution variable , in that extended space time plays the role of a _ coordinate _ , and therefore needs to be integrated over in the associated scalar product : denoting the momentary scalar product of two @xmath3-periodic functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the physical space as @xmath44 , their scalar product in the extended space reads @xcite @xmath45 thus , we write @xmath41 when considering a floquet function in the physical hilbert space , as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fls ] ) and ( [ eq : fse ] ) , whereas @xmath40 refers to that same function when viewed as an element of the extended space , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eve ] ) .",
    "this apparently formal observation has an important , physically meaningful consequence .",
    "suppose that @xmath40 is a solution to the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : eve ] ) with quasienergy @xmath9 , define @xmath46 , and let @xmath47 be an arbitrary ( positive , zero , or negative ) integer .",
    "then @xmath48 also is a @xmath3-periodic solution , with quasienergy @xmath49 . for @xmath50",
    "these two floquet functions obviously are orthogonal with respect to the scalar product  ( [ eq : scp ] ) , and represent _ different _ eigenfunctions in the extended space .",
    "on the other hand , when returning to the physical space and forming the actual floquet states  ( [ eq : fls ] ) , one has @xmath51 so that both solutions represent _ the same _ physical state .",
    "hence , a floquet state does not correspond to a single solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eve ] ) , but rather to a whole class of such solutions , labeled by the index  @xmath8 , while individual representatives of such a class are distinguished by the integer  @xmath47 .",
    "this subtlety already reflects itself in the expansion  ( [ eq : fse ] ) : although _ all _ functions @xmath52 , with @xmath8 ranging over all state labels and @xmath47 extending over all integers , are required for the completeness relation in the extended space , _ only one _ representative from each class is required in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fse ] ) , where no sum over the `` photon index '' @xmath47 appears . by the same token ,",
    "the quasienergy of a physical floquet state is determined only up to an integer multiple of the `` photon '' energy @xmath53 . in accordance with the analogous terminology used in solid - state physics",
    ", the quasienergy spectrum is said to consist of an infinite set of identical `` brillouin zones '' of width @xmath53 , covering the entire energy axis , each state placing one of its quasienergy representatives in each zone .",
    "this means , in particular , that there is no natural `` quasienergy ordering '' : without additional specification it is meaningless to ask whether one given floquet state lies `` below '' another .",
    "and there is still a further complication of a more mathematical nature : because one finds one quasienergy representative of each state in each brillouin zone , the quasienergy spectrum is `` dense '' , and it may be technically difficult to decide whether one has a dense pure point spectrum , so that the expansion  ( [ eq : fse ] ) can be taken literally and the system is stable , possessing a quasiperiodic wave function , or whether there is an absolutely continuous spectrum , allowing for diffusive energy growth @xcite .",
    "we bypass this problem by restricting ourselves to stable systems with a pure point spectrum , such as the forced anharmonic oscillators with superquadratic potentials investigated by @xcite .",
    "these considerations clearly reveal that , although there are floquet - state occupation numbers , the required analog of the energy constraint  ( [ eq : enc ] ) for time - periodically forced microcanonical close - to - ideal bose gases can not involve quasienergies directly . however , each floquet state possesses a mean energy @xcite @xmath54 which obviously is independent of the choice of the representative @xmath55 .",
    "if we now repeat the coarse - graining procedure employed in the formulation of the energy constraint  ( [ eq : enc ] ) , that is , if we divide the energy axis into small cells , the @xmath18th cell now containing @xmath19 floquet states having almost the same mean energy @xmath56 , and if @xmath23 denotes the corresponding sets of cell occupation numbers , then it seems reasonable to demand @xmath57 for an isolated system , thus obtaining a constraint which effectively may replace the previous eq .",
    "( [ eq : enc ] ) . here",
    "we assume that each driven particle sees the other driven particles as its heat bath , and undergoes subsequent short relaxation events only on a time scale which is large compared to the period  @xmath3 . in general , the justification of this constraint may require the consideration of particular physical setups , and some more specifications may be needed .",
    "but if we tentatively accept this constraint  ( [ eq : mec ] ) as it stands , it is immediately clear how to proceed : we assign the entropy  ( [ eq : ent ] ) to a time - periodically forced isolated bose gas with floquet - state occupation numbers @xmath23 , account for the particle number conservation  ( [ eq : pnc ] ) again by introducing a lagrangian multiplier @xmath30 , and incorporate the conservation of the mean energy  ( [ eq : mec ] ) with the help of a further lagrangian multiplier  @xmath58 .",
    "then the most probable set of floquet - state occupation numbers @xmath22 is determined by the variational equation @xmath32 - \\alpha \\sum_i n_i      -\\gamma \\sum_i n_i \\overline{e}_i   \\right)_{n_i = n_i^ * } = 0 \\ ; .\\ ] ] because this problem exactly parallels the problem  ( [ eq : eva ] ) already considered by @xcite , we can directly take over the solution : under the above conditions , the most probable set of floquet - state occupation numbers is @xmath59 suggesting that @xmath60 is the expected occupation number of an individual floquet state with mean energy @xmath61 .",
    "of course , this reasoning can easily be adpated to fermions , leading to the familiar `` plus '' sign in the denominator @xcite .",
    "these deliberations may have some profound physical implications . to begin with ,",
    "a time - periodically forced , stable bose gas manifestly does _ not _ constitute a nonequilibrium system , as one might naively assume , but rather an equilibrium one , with equilibrium parameters @xmath30 and @xmath58 .",
    "most noteworthy , these parameters depend on the form of the periodic time - dependence , because so do the floquet states , and hence their mean energies  ( [ eq : fme ] ) , which enter into the modified constraint  ( [ eq : mec ] ) .",
    "therefore , when writing @xmath62 in analogy to the familiar relation @xmath63 , the parameter @xmath64 introduced here is a temperature - like quantity which can be varied by changing , _",
    "e.g. _ , the strength of an external time - periodic force ; in general , @xmath64 will differ from the usual temperature @xmath3 the gas would have if there were no such forcing . likewise , when setting @xmath65 @xmath66 is the corresponding , forcing - dependent chemical potential .",
    "it follows that there are _ floquet condensates _ :",
    "if the @xmath64-temperature is sufficiently low , a time - periodically forced close - to - ideal bose gas condenses into the single - particle floquet state possessing the lowest mean energy .",
    "this deduction immediately suggests a further possibility : suppose that the hamiltonian under consideration has the natural form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 represents a time - periodic force acting on the unperturbed system @xmath69 with adjustable strength",
    ". in the regime of perturbatively weak forcing the mean - energy ordering of the floquet states of @xmath1 is likely to be the same as the energy ordering of the eigenstates of @xmath69 from which they have developed , but in the nonperturbative regime this is no longer guaranteed ; here the floquet state possessing the lowest mean energy not necessarily is connected to the @xmath69-ground state . under such conditions the floquet state into which an ultracold , time - periodically forced bose gas condenses is determined by the strength of the forcing , and may change when the latter is varied .",
    "we close this section by emphasizing that the above reasoning hinges on two key issues : the assignment of occupation numbers to the floquet states , which is borne out by theory , and the adoption of the mean - energy constraint  ( [ eq : mec ] ) as a building principle for a microcanonical floquet ensemble , which may require further thoughts .",
    "important pieces of evidence supporting our theoretical deductions are provided by the experimental observations reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : s_6 ] below . in order to facilitate the interpretation of our measurements",
    ", we first lay out some important ingredients in secs .",
    "[ sec : s_3 ] to [ sec : s_5 ] .",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice potential , which we write in the form @xmath70 is generated by two linearly polarized counterpropagating beams of laser radiation with wave number  @xmath71 , its depth @xmath72 being proportional to the laser intensity @xcite . here",
    "the lattice coordinate  @xmath73 refers to the laboratory frame of reference . considering an atom of mass  @xmath74 moving in this potential ,",
    "the lattice depth  @xmath72 is measured in units of its single - photon recoil energy  @xmath75 , @xmath76 typical optical lattices are up to tens of recoil energies deep .",
    "for example , when working with @xmath77rb in an optical lattice made up from laser light with wavelength @xmath78  nm one obtains @xmath79  ev .",
    "thus , the typical depth of an optical lattice is 11 orders of magnitude lower than that of the lattices encountered in traditional solid - state physics .",
    "this implies that the characteristic frequencies of ultracold atoms in optical lattices fall into the lower kilohertz regime .",
    "the pairs of counterpropagating beams needed to create optical lattices in one , two , or three dimensions can either be realized by splitting a laser beam in two , or by retro - reflecting a beam off a mirror . in the former case",
    ", a small frequency difference @xmath80 introduced between the two splitted laser beams with the help of acousto - optic modulators makes the lattice move with velocity @xmath81 @xcite .",

    ", this method is suitable for inducing an oscillatory motion as needed for shaking lattices , but not for applying a constant acceleration .    in the following steps , the schrdinger equation for the translational motion of an atom in the shifted lattice , governed by the hamiltonian @xmath85",
    "is subjected to a unitary transformation to the frame of reference co - moving with the lattice .",
    "first , the corresponding shift in position is implemented by means of the unitary operator @xmath86 implying @xmath87 and @xmath88 thus leading to the new hamiltonian @xmath89 next , the shift of momentum showing up here is compensated through @xmath90 giving @xmath91 together with @xmath92 finally , the merely time - dependent energy shift appearing in @xmath93 is removed by the operator @xmath94 since @xmath95 the full transformation to the co - moving frame is then realized by the combined operation @xmath96 , giving @xmath97 with @xmath98 denoting the single - particle hamiltonian pertaining to the undriven lattice , and @xmath99 introducing a homogeneous inertial force @xmath100 acting in the co - moving frame , determined by the lattice motion according to @xmath101 in particular , when a purely sinusoidal frequency shift with an initial phase  @xmath102 is suddenly applied at @xmath103 , @xmath104 eqs .",

    "nonetheless , this kick has an important experimental consequence , as will be discussed later .    as a dimensonless measure of the shaking or driving strength we introduce the quantity @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the lattice constant .",
    "thus , with driving frequencies on the order of the recoil frequency @xmath116 , and modulation amplitudes  ( [ eq : amp ] ) on the order of the lattice constant , one can easily reach the nonperturbative regime @xmath117 .",
    "it would be quite hard to realize corresponding conditions in laser - irradiated traditional solids without introducing , _",
    "e.g. _ , additional polarization effects , or even damaging the sample .",
    "therefore , strongly shaken optical lattices may also be viewed as `` strong - field simulators '' which allow one to study even superstrong - field - induced multiphoton - like processes in periodic potentials , such as interband transitions , in their purest form @xcite .",
    "in principle , the time - periodic motion  ( [ eq : osl ] ) always induces transitions between the unperturbed energy bands of the optical lattice . however , if the energy scale @xmath53 associated with the modulation frequency remains small compared to the energy gap  @xmath118 between the lowest two bands , and if the driving amplitude remains sufficiently low , the dynamics of driven ultracold atoms remain restricted to the lowest band at least to good approximation . since the band structure of a cosine lattice  ( [ eq : ocl ] )",

    "under such conditions the single - band approximation is viable , provided the forcing is not too strong , since crossing the gap would require higher - order multiphoton - like transitions @xcite . in order to model",

    ". moreover , the van der waals length of alkali atoms typically amounts to just a few nanometers @xcite and thus is significantly smaller than the lattice constant @xmath115 , so that only the on - site interaction among the atoms has to be accounted for ; this is done in terms of a parameter  @xmath134 which quantifies the interaction energy of one pair of atoms occupying the same lattice site  @xcite . in short ,",
    "when adopting these three approximations ( single - band , nearest - neighbor , and on - site ) , an ultracold gas of bosonic atoms in a time - periodically shaken optical lattice is described in the co - moving frame by the explicitly time - dependent many - body hamiltonian @xcite @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the standard bose - hubbard model for a 1d lattice @xcite , with @xmath137 denoting the bosonic annihilation operator for atoms occupying the wannier state at the @xmath138th site ; @xmath139 is the number operator for that site . recalling that the position operator  @xmath73 mediating the inertial force built into the single - particle hamiltonian  ( [ eq : spf ] ) translates , on the many - body level , into @xmath140 , with @xmath115 for the distance between two sites , the time - periodic forcing now is introduced through @xmath141 where",

    "invoking the scalar product  ( [ eq : scp ] ) , in this basis the matrix of the quasienergy operator has the structure @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a time - independent bose - hubbard hamiltonian of the familiar form  ( [ eq : bhh ] ) , but with the hopping matrix element  @xmath131 multiplied by a zero - order bessel function @xmath154 with the argument @xmath155 , resulting in the effective hopping strength @xmath156 the operator  @xmath157 , which is off - diagonal with respect to the photon index  @xmath47 , contains nearest - neighbor couplings  @xmath131 scaled by higher - order bessel functions @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "thus , the diagonalization of the quasienergy matrix  ( [ eq : qem ] ) constitutes a tremendous problem of a kind not usually considered in traditional many - body physics : infinitely many @xmath153-blocks , each one corresponding to the full hamiltonian matrix of a time - independent bose - hubbard model  ( [ eq : bhh ] ) with modified hopping matrix elements  ( [ eq : mhm ] ) , are shifted against each other in energy by integer multiples of @xmath53 , and are coupled by @xmath159-blocks .",
    "the latter blocks , in their turn , embody hopping elements which are multiplied by bessel - function factors with indices reflecting the distance of the respective block from the main diagonal . in effect , these @xmath159-couplings cause multiphoton - like resonances among the states described by the shifted diagonal blocks @xcite . while the physics of this problem has not yet been explored in full generality , its high - frequency regime is comparatively transparent .",
    "namely , if @xmath53 is large compared to the two energy scales @xmath131 and @xmath134 ( while remaining still small compared to the band gap  @xmath118 of the underlying optical lattice , so that the single - band treatment remains applicable ) , it is a good approximation to neglect the couplings induced by @xmath157 altogether , so that the driven system  ( [ eq : dbh ] ) reduces to an undriven system described by @xmath153 , meaning that the effect of the time - periodic force essentially is to `` renormalize '' the hopping matrix element according to eq .",

    "all @xmath153-blocks are equivalent , and returning from the extended to the physical hilbert space is tantamount to considering only one such block from the outset .",
    "since the ratio @xmath160 governs the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition intrinsic to the bose - hubbard model @xcite , the renormalization of @xmath131 in response to high - frequency forcing implies that it is possible to induce that transition through adjusting the parameters of the driving force , while keeping the lattice depth and hence @xmath134 constant @xcite .",
    "this type of coherent control over the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition has been demonstrated in a pioneering experiment by @xcite .",

    "such that the high - frequency approximation detailed above is valid , the corresponding many - body state in the driven optical lattice is then obtained by replacing the fock states  ( [ eq : fos ] ) in this expansion  ( [ eq : ees ] ) by the floquet - fock states  ( [ eq : ffs ] ) with @xmath173 , say , resulting in @xmath174 in order to evaluate the momentum distribution  ( [ eq : mod ] ) for this particular many - body floquet state  ( [ eq : flo ] ) we then compute @xmath175 now the only nonvanishing matrix elements are those with @xmath176 for @xmath177 ; together with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
