    "one of the striking results obtained in the last decade on strongly correlated electronic systems is the coexistence of a notion of fermi surfaceand of strong deviations from the predictions of fermi liquid theory for many low - energy properties .",
    "this has been extensively studied experimentally for high - temperature superconducting cuprates , where angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has revealed the presence of fermi surfacearcs , even in the underdoped regime which is characterized by the pseudo - gap seen with most low - energy probes.@xcite although these systems exhibit intermediate or even strong electron interactions , they have triggered many theoretical works using perturbative tools.@xcite    at the beginning of any perturbative analysis , the shape of the fermi surfaceis crucial in determining which couplings survive in an effective low - energy description.@xcite for most crystalline materials the absence of continuous rotational invariance allows for a deformation of the fermi surfaceaway from the bare free electron fermi surface , as interactions are switched on . in many metallic systems",
    "this effect is not expected to play much role beyond usual renormalizations of effective parameters of band theory .",
    "but in some situations , like the vicinity of a van - hove singularity , the presence of a nesting vector , or for strongly anisotropic conductors , it seems essential to understand how to compute the dressed fermi surface , since it is the relevant object for the construction of an effective low - energy theory .    in the case of quasi one - dimensional ( quasi 1d ) systems",
    ", this fermi surfacedeformation is intimately connected to the widely studied notion of transverse coherence .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations converge towards a description in terms of almost uncoupled luttinger liquids along the chains , at high enough energies.@xcite at low energies , optical conductivity measurements@xcite have shown the existence of two types of behaviors : either the system remains confined in a mott - insulator phase ( in the tmttf compounds ) or the transverse hopping of electrons takes over and establishes a long - ranged transverse phase coherence , leading to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi liquid phase ( for the tmtsf ) . in the latter case the dressed fermi surfaceremains warped while in the former it becomes completely flat under the effect of sufficiently strong interactions.@xcite    because of their difficulty , precise computations of fermi surfacedeformations for model systems have been undertaken only recently .",
    "a direct numerical evaluation of the electron propagator to second order in interaction has been performed for the 2d hubbard model.@xcite similar studies have also been carried for more phenomenological models where electrons are scattered by dynamical spin fluctuations.@xcite although these computations yield valuable physical understanding of the processes involved in the fermi surfacedeformation , they suffer from at least two serious problems .",
    "first , they identify the dressed fermi surfacewith the locus of points in @xmath0-space for which the dressed quasiparticle energy is equal to the ( interacting ) chemical potential , which is of course correct .",
    "but this does not imply that the imaginary part of the self - energyvanishes on this surface and for frequencies equal to the chemical potential . therefore this procedure does not lead to a picture of asymptotically stable quasiparticles at low energies .",
    "this remark is valid in the zero temperature approach , which is the only one we are using in this paper , because of its conceptual simplicity .",
    "second , this problem is not cured while going to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , some new problems arise ( namely infrared divergences ) at these higher orders for both zero and finite temperature formalisms .",
    "the underlying assumption of the standard perturbation scheme as used above is that one can generate the interacting ground - state by adiabatically switching on the interactions , starting from the non - interacting ground - state .",
    "this has to be questioned for large systems for which the ground - state lies at the edge of an energy continuum .",
    "because of this , the perturbation algorithm acting on various excited states of the original systems , associated to different shapes of the fermi surface , has the possibility to generate energy levels crossings .",
    "this implies that the seed state to be used in perturbation theory is not known a priori , when interactions do deform the fermi surface .",
    "this difficulty has been pointed out in the sixties by kohn and luttinger,@xcite and also nozires.@xcite these ideas have been revived recently in a mathematically rigorous framework.@xcite the conclusion of all these works is that a sound formalism is obtained when one works with a bare propagator which singularities are pinned to the _ dressed _ fermi surface .",
    "this is achieved in practice by the introduction of counterterms , which have to be computed order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "the main difficulty in practical implementations of this philosophy ( which may be called renormalized perturbation theory ) is that it provides only an implicit determination of the dressed fermi surface , since this algorithm expresses the bare fermi surfaceas a function of the dressed one . although formally this connection has been proved to be invertible,@xcite this remains a formidable task which has never been , to our knowledge , practically undertaken .",
    "note that the necessity to use these counterterms is not a pathology of the zero temperature approach .",
    "it also appears in the matsubara formalism at finite temperature which is the one used in the rigorous works just described .    as a first step towards the realization of this program ,",
    "several groups have performed self - consistent computations .",
    "their basic principle is to start with a trial fermi surface , which is adjusted so that it matches with the calculated fermi surface .",
    "a first example follows directly the standard hartree - fock method.@xcite it has been applied to the 2d hubbard model in the presence of second - neighbor hopping and nearest neighbor interaction , and the possibility of a change in fermi surfacetopology ( from hole - like to electron - like ) has been observed . a rather sophisticated scheme has also been developed by nojiri,@xcite in which the self - energyis self - consistently computed from the corresponding second order feynman diagram .",
    "this work addressed the simplest 2d hubbard model with on - site interaction for which the fermi surfacedeformation was found to be very small and to preserve the fermi surfacetopology .",
    "note that the quantitative difference between this self - consistent scheme and a standard perturbation theory@xcite appears to be small .    in spite of their merits ,",
    "these approaches lack the ability to keep track of the growth of some effective couplings , as the typical energy scale is lowered .",
    "these effects play a crucial role for the 2d hubbard model near half - filling , or for quasi 1d conductors .",
    "a natural way of handling these trends is to use a renormalization group ( rg ) approach .",
    "several groups have incorporated the rg methodology in the computation of the dressed fermi surface.@xcite similar studies have also been carried for two coupled chains where the fermi surfacereduces to four fermi points.@xcite our understanding of these works is that they always begin with a known bare fermi surfaceand compute the evolution of the effective fermi surface , as the high - energy cut - off is gradually decreased .",
    "although this is very reasonable on physical grounds , we may wonder whether this fits with the general rigorous analysis described in the last but one paragraph .",
    "we believe there are two ways to combine the corresponding requirements with a rg approach .",
    "the first one uses the renormalized perturbation theory described above , with a running energy cut - off .",
    "after the usual mode integration in a small energy shell , the kinetic term in the effective action is corrected to preserve the shape of the dressed fermi surface . in the process of integrating the rg flow , one has to keep track of and sum all these counterterms to obtain the bare fermi surfaceas a function of the dressed one .",
    "alternatively , one would fix the bare high - energy theory , and perform the mode integration is such a way that modes being integrated out always remain at a finite distance from the flowing fermi surface .",
    "but then one has to ensure that all modes are integrated over exactly once with a uniform weight .",
    "this is indeed possible but requires some slight modifications of the wilson - polchinski usual rg equations.@xcite we believe the practical implementation of either approach remains to be attempted .",
    "the bulk of this paper is composed of three sections .",
    "[ sec : csfs ] begins with a general discussion of some difficulties with the standard perturbation theory .",
    "we then develop a physical understanding of the driving force that deforms the fermi surfaceon the basis of a simple variational calculation for a system of two spinless chains . the main insight gained here",
    "is that the couplings which tend to deform the fermi surfaceare those for which external momenta of in and out going particles can not be simultaneously taken on the fermi surface , because of momentum conservation . in the rg language , these interactions are usually called irrelevant .",
    "we finally establish the equivalence between this procedure and a standard renormalized perturbation theory where the dressed fermi surfaceis fixed by counterterms .",
    "the reader interested in more technical aspects is referred to appendices [ app : equi ] , [ app : diff_re ] and [ app : diff_im ] ( the first two begin with some simple first order calculations on the system of two spinless chains , whose results can be compared to the ones obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : csfs ] ) . in secs .",
    "[ sec : rg_formalism ] and [ sec : rg_numerical ] we show how the rg can be implemented in the study of quasi 1d systems .",
    "we want to emphasise that we have not made use of a single rg scheme , but of two coupled rg schemes .",
    "we describe our motivations for performing such a study in secs .",
    "[ sec : sub : sub : gen_th_an ] and [ sec : sub : motiv_use_two_rg ] , but let us very briefly explain what they are , before coming to a more detailed description of secs .",
    "[ sec : rg_formalism ] and [ sec : rg_numerical ] .",
    "the field - theoretical rg in the spirit of gell - mann and low@xcite is a simple but powerful way of computing low - energy properties of systems described by a renormalizable field - theory .",
    "this is why we adopted it for this purpose ( this method is discussed in detail in appendix [ app : field_th ] ) .",
    "however , it can not be used to compute the dressed fermi surface , for the simple reason that the fermi surfaceis defined as the locus of the zeros , in @xmath0-space of the inverse propagator evaluated at _",
    "zero frequency_. there is thus no low - energy scale @xmath1 that can be varied to get rg equations as is done for example for the low - energy vertices , when relating the values of these vertices at two different scales @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , one can use the approach known under the name cut - off scaling , and developed by slyom.@xcite this rg does not suffer from the limitation just described , because it is the high - energy cut - off and not the low - energy scale that is varied , and we have used it for the computation of the dressed fermi surface .",
    "the high - energy part of the flows , in which the fermi surface deformation takes place , is thus described by the cut - off scaling .",
    "the dressed fermi surfacethat one obtains in this way then serves as an input parameter for the field - theoretical rg which governs the low - energy part of the flows .",
    "let us say that rg flow equations appear neither in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg_formalism ] nor in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg_numerical ] , but they all have been gathered in appendix [ app : flow_eq ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg_formalism ] we set up the cut - off scaling approach for the study of fermi surfacedeformations in a quasi 1d system of weakly coupled electronic chains . in order to make the ideas more concrete , this method is then applied to the simplest possible example , and we end the section with a comparison to other methods that can be found in the literature .",
    "we then turn to numerical investigations , that are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg_numerical ] , for short range , hubbard - like , repulsive electron interactions .",
    "[ sec : sub : first_num_std ] deals with considerations about systems away from half - filling which exhibit an incommensurate nesting vector for their fermi surface .",
    "the flow pattern involves a high - energy luttinger liquid regime , followed by a fermi liquid at intermediate energy , and finally a long - range ordered spin - density wave ( sdw ) phase is the stable low - energy attractor .",
    "special attention has been given to the scale and transverse size dependence of the quasiparticle weight .",
    "we then focus on the half - filled ( and nearly half - filled ) case in sec .",
    "[ sec : sub : umklapps_limitations ] , where umklapp processes may drive the system into a confined low - energy phase and pin the sdw on the crystal lattice .",
    "in particular we study the cross - over between the confined and the fermi liquid regimes .",
    "it is shown to occur for bare values of the inter - chain hopping of the order of the 1d mott charge gap .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , the computation of the dressed fermi surface in an interacting metallic state encounters some obstacles because of the presence of a continuum of low - lying energy states in the immediate vicinity of the non - interacting ground - state .",
    "this has been already discussed in a very inspiring paper by kohn and luttinger.@xcite there , they have shown that the standard brueckner - goldstone perturbation theory for the ground - state energy is not consistent with a careful procedure of taking the zero - temperature limit of the total energy computed in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "they interpret this failure in terms of the pattern of energy levels of an interacting fermi system as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "when the shape of the fermi surface changes , a deep reshuffling of the spectrum takes place , leading to a huge number of level crossings . a simple illustration for this is given on fig .",
    "[ fig : branch_adiab_et_cr_niv ] .        at this stage",
    ", it is important to distinguish between two situations , which have both interesting physical realizations . for some simple models , such as a ladder of interacting spinless fermions , or a single chain of spin @xmath3 electrons ,",
    "the total number of particles of a given species ( transverse momentum in the ladder case , or the @xmath4 component of the spin for spin @xmath3 electrons ) may be conserved . as a result of this symmetry , the level crossings just mentioned are an essential feature of the exact many - body spectrum . in more general situations , these level crossings appear at any _ finite _ order in a perturbative computation of the spectrum as a function of interaction strength , although they are expected to disappear in an exact treatment for a finite - size system .",
    "let us first concentrate on the former case for a while , since it shows dramatically why and where difficulties arise .",
    "in such situations , the conventional assumption often made in many - body computations does not hold .",
    "it states that one can get the interacting many - body ground - state by adiabatically switching on the interactions , starting from the non - interacting ground - state .",
    "a trivial example where the adiabatic switching procedure most often generates an excited state is provided in the case of the free hamiltonian : @xmath5 where we arbitrarily split @xmath6 in two parts : @xmath7 this induces a decomposition of @xmath8 as a sum @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the `` unperturbed '' hamiltonian , and @xmath11 the perturbation . since @xmath10 and @xmath12 commute , the eigenstates of @xmath8 do not depend on the strength @xmath13 of the perturbation .",
    "but energy levels as functions of @xmath13 are free to cross ,",
    "so the initial ground - state ( i.e.for @xmath14 ) becomes in general an excited state for finite @xmath13 .",
    "this is reflected on the computation of the single particle green s function in the zero temperature formalism .",
    "starting with the `` bare '' propagator @xmath15 , the conventional algorithm yields a `` dressed '' propagator @xmath16 instead of the correct result : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the bare and the dressed chemical potentials respectively .",
    "note that the problem would apparently disappear in a finite temperature approach using the matsubara formalism .",
    "however , kohn and luttinger have shown that special care is needed in taking the zero temperature limit , since they have found a class of diagrams ( they have called them anomalous diagrams ) for which the zero temperature limit and the infinite volume limit do not commute .",
    "taking the former limit first yields a vanishing contribution for those diagrams , and therefore the wrong result of the standard zero temperature formalism is obtained . the correct result for an infinite system",
    "is obtained by taking the other order of limits , where anomalous diagrams do provide finite contributions .",
    "for this reason , and also given the conceptual interest of this problem , we shall use only the zero temperature formalism throughout this paper . in this framework , a natural way to circumvent this problem with level crossings is to start the standard perturbation algorithm with any arbitrary eigenstate of the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath10 . intuitively , we believe in most cases it is sufficient to choose an initial state where the locus of occupied single particle states is singly connected ( i.e.it has no isolated particle - hole excitations from the viewpoint of @xmath10 ) , but with a deformed fermi surface , as shown on fig .  [ fig : sf_lib_hab ] .",
    "the selection of the correct initial state is performed by minimizing the total energy of the dressed state it generates , after switching on the interactions .",
    "an example of this procedure is given below ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sub:2chaines_ordre1 ] ) for a simple two - chain model .    for practical purposes",
    ", it is important to note that this approach may also be implemented through a perturbative computation of the single particle green s function . instead of using the free propagator @xmath15",
    ", we should first make a guess for the dressed fermi surface .",
    "this allows us to define a function @xmath20 such that @xmath21 if @xmath0 does not belong to the trial fermi sea , and @xmath22 if @xmath0 belongs to it .    -space .",
    "the dashed line denotes the non - interacting fermi surface . in state",
    "( a ) , the fermi surfaceis deformed , but no additional particle - hole excitations are present , unlike in state ( b).,width=302 ]    the locus of points in @xmath0-space where @xmath20 jumps from @xmath23 to @xmath24 is our trial fermi surface , and points on this set will be generically denoted as @xmath25 in the present discussion .",
    "the corresponding bare propagator to be used in feynman graph expansions is : @xmath26 as usual , the dressed propagator is obtained as @xmath27 , where the subscript @xmath28 in @xmath29 is to stress the influence of the choice of a trial fermi surface encoded in the function @xmath28 .",
    "if this trial fermi surface is the correct one for the interacting fermi system , we expect the self - energysatisfies the following well - known conditions :    \\i ) there exists a well defined chemical potential @xmath30 so that for any @xmath25 belonging to the trial fermi surface , we have : @xmath31    \\ii ) the inverse life - time of `` quasiparticles '' vanishes on the trial fermi surface so that : @xmath32 of course , these conditions are not satisfied for most trial fermi surfaces , as the reader will immediately notice on simple examples .",
    "we have checked on several examples that both procedures ( i.e.minimizing the total energy , or satisfying conditions i ) and ii ) on the dressed single particle propagator ) yield the same dressed fermi surface . in appendix",
    "[ app : equi ] , we provide a formal proof of this equivalence , first in the finite volume case , and then in the case of an infinite volume .",
    "when the choice of @xmath28 is not the correct one , it is impossible to satisfy both conditions i ) and ii ) simultaneously . in the case of standard perturbation theory @xmath28",
    "is taken to be @xmath33 corresponding to the bare fermi surface , obtained from @xmath10.@xcite the dressed fermi surface is assumed to be determined from an equation which resembles condition i ) , namely : @xmath34 but doing this yields two severe flaws : as shown in appendix [ app : diff_re ] , this does not generate the same dressed fermi surface as the two procedures presented above and argued to be the correct ones do . furthermore , in perturbation theory , @xmath35 changes sign on the non - interacting fermi surface , and for @xmath36 equal to the non - interacting chemical potential @xmath18 as shown in appendix [ app : diff_im ] .",
    "this discussion holds clearly in the case where energy level crossings associated to various initial shapes of the fermi surface are protected by some symmetries of the full hamiltonian , as stated at the beginning of this section . here",
    ", we would like to emphasize that a similar qualitative picture also holds in a more generic situation . on general grounds",
    ", we expect that energy levels of a finite system do not cross as the interaction strength is increased .",
    "this is the famous phenomenon of energy level repulsion which plays a key role in the field of `` quantum chaos '' ( see for instance the book by gutzwiller@xcite ) .",
    "so , standard perturbation theory starting from the unperturbed ground - state is expected to generate the correct interacting ground - state for a _",
    "finite _ system",
    ". however , to get the full single energy level resolution in the spectrum with all the avoided level crossings clearly requires going to very high orders in perturbation theory . instead , in most many - body computations , we first get formal expressions for various quantities such as green s functions for a chosen _ finite _ order in powers of the interaction , and we most often take the thermodynamical limit _ before _ summing the perturbation series .",
    "we believe this procedure is most likely to generate in the end an excited state of the interacting system , although the seed of the perturbation series is the non - interacting ground - state .",
    "this belief is confirmed by the simple computations in appendix [ app : diff_re ] , which do not require any special symmetry of the full hamiltonian .",
    "let us first focus on the simplest possible model exhibiting the features described previously : a system of two chains of interacting spinless fermions .",
    "we will assume this system to be anisotropic , described by a tight - binding hamiltonian , with a hopping @xmath37 along the chain much larger than the transverse hopping @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we have two bands , named by the transverse momentum they correspond to , i.e.0 ( bonding ) and @xmath39 ( anti - bonding ) .",
    "we suppose the filling is such that both bands are partially filled .",
    "we will furthermore focus on the low - energy properties , so that we can linearize the spectrum around the four fermi points , giving rise to four types of fermions : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as usual , we extend the spectrum for arbitrary momenta .",

    ", we will simplify the problem and suppose that the fermi velocities for both branches are equal , and they will simply be denoted as @xmath51 .",
    "we shall also make simplifying assumptions about the interactions .",

    "the use of counterterms in interacting fermionic systems , for which the fermi surfacegets deformed , is quite old , and can for example be found in the beautiful discussion by nozires,@xcite where the reader will find more details .",
    "the main idea , which has been illustrated very recently,@xcite , is to take the interacting fermi sea as the starting point of perturbation theory .",

    "this scale can not be determined precisely in the cut - off scaling scheme , which is only a very simple version of the wilsonian approach .",
    "only the latter approach could precisely describe the transition between the two regimes , which would not even occur at a single scale ( because of the large number of different scales @xmath176 appearing in the rhs of the rg flow equations ) .",

    "note that they obtained this equation from the previous works by bourbonnais and co - workers@xcite and kimura@xcite ( see also the review article by firsov , prigodin and seidel@xcite ) .",
    "we however choose the paper by kishine and yonemitsu because their formalism is the closest to ours .",
    "the comparison is easily achieved in two steps : first notice that our fermi momenta do not flow when no interactions are turned on ( which is desirable , since the fermi surfaceshould not get deformed in this case ) , while their @xmath38 flows in this case , because of the first term of their equation coming from the rescaling they have performed , so that we should simply forget this term if we want to compare our results .",
    "second , we have to take the particular set of couplings they have chosen , namely local couplings .",
    "this is obtained when setting all charge couplings to the same value , and doing the same for spin couplings and umklapps .",
    "repeating exactly what we have done in the previous section , we find : @xmath189 this in particular means that all fermi momenta @xmath190 will be scaled by the same factor .",
    "next , we have to link our charge and spin couplings to the g - ology notation .",
    "it is easily checked that one simply has : @xmath191 and @xmath192 ( here all @xmath193 and @xmath194 couplings of the g - ology are equal because we have restricted ourselves to spin - rotation invariant couplings ) .",
    "we also have the trivial identification @xmath195 .",
    "the difference in the numerical factor 4 simply comes from a different normalization of the dimensionless couplings ( we divided the couplings by @xmath142 and they divided them by @xmath196 ) . finally , we have @xmath197 which shows the equivalence between the two approaches .",
    "we want to stress that this equivalence relies on our simple approximation according to which the fermi surfaceis deformed only in the high energy regime , since this deformation is driven by irrelevant couplings . it would be possible to go beyond this approximation by implementing the iterative procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : sub : sub : gen_th_an ] . to estimate the residual deformation of the fermi surfaceinduced by these irrelevant couplings in the low - energy regime remains an interesting open question , that could be addressed within the general framework discussed in this paper .",
    "furthermore , such a calculation would enable us to take into account the deformation of the fermi surfaceinduced by the hartree terms which are effective only when the forward scattering amplitudes significantly vary along the fermi line .",
    "such a dependence is only generated when the running cut - off becomes comparable to or smaller than the natural scale associated to the transverse dispersion .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we shall give a simple and quick derivation of the rg equation , which emphasizes the role of the 1d chains ( see note 31 of ref .",

    "( [ eq : flot_phi ] ) specialized to the 1d case .",
    "this yields the correct flow equation for @xmath38 .",
    "let us also mention that this way of taking into account the inter - chain tunneling has been recently adopted by essler and tsvelik,@xcite except that they use the exact 1d green s function instead of the result of a perturbative rg computation .",
    "let us now compare our results with those of fabrizio,@xcite whose work is devoted to the two - chain model without longitudinal umklapps , but with fermi velocity renormalization .",
    "fabrizio used a wilsonian rg ( at two loops ) for the calculation of the deformation of the fermi surface .",
    "as one can expect , this formalism allows to cross the energy scales coming from the non - flatness of the fermi surface(see how the flows are defined piece - wise in his appendix a , and for which the various rhs never diverge ) .",
    "our equations coincide with those of fabrizio in the high - energy regime ( when his function @xmath207 is expanded to lowest order in @xmath208 , the dimensionless @xmath209 ) , and in the low - energy regime where the flow of the fermi surfacevanishes .",
    "the intermediate regime is of course different .",
    "note for the comparison that fabrizio s coupling @xmath210 is our coupling @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we would like to note that our results at one loop are consistent with the article of louis , alvarez and gros,@xcite ( see their eqs .  ( 9 ) and ( 13 ) ) if we specialize these to the case of uniform fermi velocities .",
    "before we present our results for specific models , we wish to emphasize that one of our motivations besides the fermi surfacedeformation was to describe precisely the connection between the essentially 1d high - energy regime , and the 2d low - energy physics where the system is sensitive to the warping of the fermi surface .",
    "this can be viewed as a complement to the rg analysis of lin et al.@xcite who have focused exclusively on the low - energy side where the cut - off is much smaller than the scale associated to the transverse dispersion . in this work",
    ", they could relate the high and low energy regimes without actually solving rg flow equations for the former since they assumed very weak bare couplings ( so that these couplings were barely renormalized in the high energy part of the flow ) .",
    "although working with the full wilsonian effective action allows one to get through such intermediate energy scales , it is not clear to us that this can be achieved in a reliable way with the cut - off scaling .",
    "indeed , our view of this procedure is that it provides a simple approximation of the full wilsonian rg , which is certainly well controlled when the running cut - off is much larger than the intrinsic low - energy scales of the system s dynamics .",
    "because of this we have decided to study the low - energy part of the flow in the field - theoretical framework .",
    "this latter scheme heavily relies on the existence of an infinite cut - off limit ( continuum limit ) , or in other words the corresponding theory of 1d fermions with linear dispersion and point - like interactions is renormalizable .",
    "this statement is _ independent _ of the existence of intrinsic low - energy scales such as a mass term , or variations in fermi wave vectors with the chain index . in this context",
    "rg equations are obtained by relating physical properties measured at different running energy scales . to avoid confusion with cut - off scaling this running scale",
    "has been denoted by @xmath1 in appendix [ app : field_th ] which presents some details on this approach .",
    "since we have used a logarithmic approximation , the high - energy flows of the couplings in both cut - off scaling and field - theoretical rg are identical .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the two schemes give the same physical low - energy results or not .",
    "we plan to study this in more detail in a forthcoming work .",
    "we will now show what information can be deduced from numerical computations . for this",

    "we thus have shown that after a high - energy 1d regime where the fermi surface s shape is not felt in the flow of the couplings , and after the crossing of the typical energy - scale given by the curvature of the fermi surface , the system goes to a strong coupling phase of the sdw type , with the above effective low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath276 nesting vector naturally arises from the rg flow , and there is no need to artificially introduce it .",

    "[ fig : flot_nimpair ] .",
    "this figure is obviously different from fig .",
    "[ fig : flot_gcs ] .",

    "we have analysed which couplings are non - zero in the low - energy phase of fig .",
    "[ fig : flot_nimpair ] , and these turn out to be bcs type couplings , indicating a superconducting low - energy phase .",
    "this is not in contradiction with what has been said before in the even @xmath130 case .",
    "when @xmath130 grows , the nesting is better and better in the odd @xmath130 case , so that the rg flow will first be towards the same fixed direction as in the even @xmath130 case .",
    "then , there will be a shift from this fixed direction to another one , corresponding to superconductivity .",
    "but , this will take place at very low energies , and in regimes where the norm of the couplings has exploded .",
    "the conclusion is that the low - energy phase , in the thermodynamical limit , is always the one we have observed in the even @xmath130 case .",
    "this discussion has been quite brief , but we refer the reader to our previous paper where we had analysed in detail how the observed shift from one fixed direction to another one , in a finite @xmath130 situation , slows down as @xmath130 increases and finally disappears in the infinite @xmath130 limit .",
    "we have checked all this numerically , but unfortunately it requires quite a large value of @xmath130 ( more than 30 ) to be visible , so that we could not depict it in this paper .      in the above two simple examples we have studied , we encountered no real limitation of the computation scheme we have proposed .",
    "of course , we had to use a non rigorous ( but plausible ) argument to define the scale at which we had to stop the flow of the couplings .",
    "we will see that there are some cases where it is not possible to use such a simple point of view .",
    "the well known main limitation of a rg approach is its perturbative nature .",
    "we can not fully trust the rg flows when they go to strong couplings , even if the fixed direction that is reached in this regime gives an insight of what physics takes place .",
    "for the two computations of the fermi surfacewe have given previously , it is clear that this was no limitation , because the deformation of the fermi surfaceoccurred in a weak coupling regime ( remember figs .",
    "[ fig : flot_gcs ] and [ fig : norme ] , where the norm diminishes between @xmath278 , which is the time interval where the deformation of the fermi surfacetakes place ) .",
    "the half - filled system is interesting , because it exhibits a variety of behaviors , depending on the strength of the bare couplings ( compared to the value of the bare transverse hopping ) .",
    "we will discuss the strong , intermediate and weak coupling situations , which do not give the same low - energy physics .",
    "after this , we will consider the case of a nearly half - filled system .      by strong coupling ,",
    "we mean the initial couplings are large enough for the behavior of the system to remain purely one - dimensional . to make this statement more precise , let us study the flows for one of these strong coupling initial conditions .",
    "we will assume , as we always did , that @xmath213 .",
    "in this case , the hubbard - condition @xmath279 and @xmath280 is a strong coupling condition , for which the rg leads to a fully flat fermi surface .",
    "in fact , as the couplings are large and grow quickly ( because of the umklapps ) , the fermi surfaceflattens quickly , so that the decreasing cut - off never catches the scale of the fermi surface , and there is no non - zero value of @xmath175 .",
    "the flow of the couplings is thus purely 1d all along the flow and is well known , so that we do not show it .",

    "this means the couplings have grown a lot .",
    "for example for the umklapps , @xmath282 which is very big , so that the rg is not valid anymore . however , if we believe the rg is qualitatively valid , the flow of the fermi momenta seems to show the existence of a confined phase ( the effective @xmath38 is zero ) . as the system goes to strong coupling , and remains purely 1d",

    "the cross - over scale @xmath175 between the luttinger and the fermi liquid behavior is much larger than the typical scale for the onset of long range order .",
    "the system is therefore in a deconfined regime , in the sense that it allows for coherent transverse motion of electron - like excitations .",
    "an example of this is obtained while using initial hubbard couplings @xmath283 and @xmath284 , and as usual @xmath213 .",
    "it is not worth representing the deformation of the fermi surfacein this case , for it is very small ( for @xmath211 , the effective @xmath285 is about 0.0995 , so that the correction is of the order of half a percent ) .",

    "the intermediate coupling regime is the same as the one observed in the half - filled case , where the umklapps are not suppressed , because the scale at which the phase transition takes place is bigger than the scale that measures the distance from half - filling , namely @xmath388 . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "the umklapps are irrelevant , and all vanish ( for the normalized couplings ) at low energies .",
    "the final fixed direction is simply the one we previously found in sec .",
    "[ sec : sub : first_num_std ] , where we had set the umklapps to zero at the beginning of the flow .",
    "the flows of the couplings are represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : flots_gcsu_pdr ] , and were obtained for @xmath211 and initial coupling @xmath386 . we also have represented the evolution of the norm of the couplings , because its behavior changes drastically at the precise time the umklapps become irrelevant ( @xmath389 ) .",
    "the plateau observed in the norm s evolution just after this time reveals the existence of an intermediate fermi liquid phase .",
    "these flows show how our rg , taking account of the different scales of the system , is able to get rid of the irrelevant couplings , such as the umklapps , and leads to the correct final fixed direction .",
    "this is not of a purely academic interest . indeed , if one takes the same value of the initial couplings ( @xmath385 ) , but set @xmath137 to zero from the beginning ( with a flow very much like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : flot_gcs ] ) , the scale at which the phase transition occurs is found to be @xmath390 times smaller as the one found when the umklapps are incorporated and vanish along the flow .",
    "this can in part be explained because neglecting the umklapps from the beginning of the flow is a very crude approximation .",
    "we could also take the umklapps into account in the 1d part of the flow , and then take them to zero .",
    "however , a look at fig .",
    "[ fig : flots_gcsu_pdr ] shows that the umklapps do not vanish very fast , and their influence has thus no reason to be small .",
    "indeed , we performed this comparison , and found that this prediction is correct .",
    "in fact both methods neglecting the umklapps at one time or another , give approximately the same critical temperature , because the hubbard coupling @xmath137 is small so that the couplings do not change much in the 1d region ( we found @xmath391 and @xmath392 in the end of the 1d flow ) .",
    "we have attempted to develop a simple physical picture to understand the forces which drive the deformations of the fermi surfaceof an interacting electron system . using considerations from second - order time - independent perturbation theory",
    ", we showed that the shape of the dressed fermi surfacecontrols the quantum zero - point motion correction to the ground - state energy .",
    "we demonstrated that a given coupling tends to deform the fermi surfaceso as to have all its four momenta precisely on the fermi surface , because this allows for smaller energy denominators ( in the second order contribution ) and thus decreases the total energy . as a consequence ,",
    "we find that the fermi surfaceis deformed by irrelevant couplings , which are characterized by the impossibility of choosing all four momenta on the fermi surface . because of this , the fermi surfacedeformation induced by these couplings can only occur in the high - energy regime where the kinematical constraints associated to the fermi surfacedo not play much role .",
    "once the energy is low enough and the warping of the fermi surfaceis felt , these irrelevant couplings do not flow any more and no longer contribute to the fermi surfacedeformation .",
    "for the quasi 1d materials at half - filling , the umklapp couplings belong to this category . as they undergo a strong renormalization in the high - energy regime , they have a much more drastic effect than the charge or spin couplings in the doped system .",
    "our numerical simulation provide a description of the cross - over from the confined regime to the fermi liquid , which is in overall good agreement with previous works.@xcite we have presented a detailed analysis of the evolution of the quasiparticle weights as a function of the typical energy scale .",
    "this confirms the existence of a fermi liquid regime at intermediate energies , for the deconfined systems .",
    "it would be very interesting to compute the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivities , which could be done by adapting some existing methods@xcite to quasi 1d systems .",
    "another problem is to investigate the nature of spin correlations in the confined regime .",
    "this can not be achieved within the present formalism since the couplings diverge at a scale associated to the charge gap which is much larger than the nel temperature in the limit of small transverse hopping .",
    "this problem has been addressed by kishine and yonemitsu@xcite who used rg equations to two - loop order for the couplings .",
    "but it is not clear that the two - loop corrections provide a reliable description since the couplings do not remain small .",
    "this limitation of our method is certainly connected to the fact that we are using a physical picture in which the fermion fields remain the elementary objects .",
    "this is valid at sufficiently high energies and thus generically adapted to the study of the fermi surfacedeformations .",
    "however in the confined regime , elementary excitations are likely to be very different from the fermi liquid - like quasiparticles , but rather some soliton - like objects . in this case",
    ", it seems a deeper understanding of the corresponding phases should be obtained by expanding around the exact solution for a system of uncoupled chains.@xcite nevertheless this raises the important issue of the validity of an adiabatic principle for generating the ground - state at finite transverse hopping from the ground - state of uncoupled chains . at half - filling",
    "this adiabatical principle certainly holds in the confined phase where the charge gap is finite .",
    "but its validity beyond the critical value of the transverse hopping is questionable .",
    "this may explain the qualitative discrepancy between the perturbation approach of essler and tsvelik,@xcite which leads to a disconnected fermi surfacewith electron and hole pockets , and the dynamical mean - field theory of biermann et al , who have obtained a conventional fermi surface(see fig .  5 of the latter work@xcite ) .",
    "away from half - filling , this notion of adiabatic continuity is even less obvious to prove since the energy gap vanishes for uncoupled luttinger liquids .",
    "however we believe the use of a skeleton expansion by arrigoni@xcite likely provides a way to circumvent this potential difficulty .",

    "the energy minimization method or this self - consistent computation of the self - energycarried formally to first order in interaction do generate the same higher order terms .",

    "the total energy of these states is of course @xmath409 .",

    "using the fact that @xmath510 and @xmath511 behave as @xmath505 for @xmath36 close to @xmath18 , we notice that a single self - energy insertion in the sunrise graph preserves the property that @xmath506 vanishes for @xmath507 .",
    "more generally , this implies that @xmath512 up to third order in perturbation theory .",
    "however , a fermi surface deformation already occurs usually for the simplest hartree and fock graphs , which are first order in the coupling strength . in the standard perturbation scheme ,",
    "the dressed chemical potential and the dressed fermi surface are determined by solving the infinite set of equations : @xmath513 with the constraint that the total volume of the fermi surface does not change as interactions are switched on .",
    "we therefore see that , in this scheme , there is no reason for which @xmath514 should vanish .",
    "this is rather unsatisfactory on physical grounds , since it would imply a finite life - time for particle - like excitations lying just on the dressed fermi surface .",
    "this appendix is devoted to a detailed derivation of the field - theoretical rg equations which we have gathered in appendix [ app : flow_eq ] .",
    "the two main considerations we wish to stress here are : i ) the choice of external momenta in the renormalization prescriptions , which has to be adapted to the fermi surfaceshape , and ii ) the use of the logarithmic approximation .      in the usual `` field - theoretical '' rg ,",
    "the high - energy hamiltonian is given and fixed , and one parametrizes the theory by low - energy values of proper green s functions ( for instance the interaction vertices ) at a typical scale @xmath1 .",
    "requiring that all these theories at different energy scales should correspond to one and the same high - energy theory yields rg flows , when @xmath1 is varied .",
    "this approach is physically natural , because it is based on the calculation of low - energy observables .",
    "furthermore , as we will see , it allows for a study of crossovers between high and low - energy regimes .",
    "one of its limitations is that it requires renormalizable interactions ( i.e.the existence of a continuous limit ) .",
    "but it is not really a severe drawback , since non - renormalizable interactions are expected to be irrelevant ( by power counting ) in the low - energy limit , which is the most interesting to us .",
    "note that the renormalizability constraint disappears in rg schemes based on wilson s idea of gradual mode elimination .",
    "several groups have recently implemented wilson s approach to the rg , expressed via the polchinski equation,@xcite or its one - particle irreducible version.@xcite although these equations are exact , they are quite complicated , since effective interactions involving an arbitrary number of particles are generated along the rg flow .",
    "any numerical computation therefore requires drastic truncations in the effective action .",
    "by contrast , the field - theory approach involves only a much smaller set of effective or running couplings , which is a good feature for practical implementations .",
    "first of all , we have to define the renormalized couplings .",
    "the two corresponding green s functions ( in real space for the direction parallel to the chains ) are : @xmath515 { | 0 \\rangle},\\nonumber\\\\    & & u^{i\\!\\!i}(x_4,x_3,x_2,x_1)=\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{1cm}-{\\langle 0 | } { \\mathrm{t}}\\big [ { \\psi^{}}_{{{\\mathrm r}},i+\\delta,\\tau}(x_4 ) { \\psi^{}}_{{{\\mathrm r}},j-\\delta,\\rho}(x_3)\\\\    & & \\hspace{3cm}\\times{\\psi^\\dagger}_{{{\\mathrm l}},j,\\rho'}(x_2 ) { \\psi^\\dagger}_{{{\\mathrm l}},i,\\tau'}(x_1)\\big ] { | 0 \\rangle}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations , @xmath516 is the interacting ground - state , t is the time ordering operator , and @xmath517 is a shorthand notation for @xmath518 .",
    "the renormalized couplings are the values of the amputated one - particle irreducible parts of these green s functions , divided by @xmath519 .",
    "in fact , the charge and spin couplings are the coefficients obtained from the fourier transform of @xmath520 , factor of @xmath521 and @xmath522 respectively .",
    "the umklapp coupling @xmath523 is defined in the same way from @xmath524 , as the coefficient of @xmath521 ( the one in front of @xmath525 being @xmath526 ) .",
    "the set of external frequencies is chosen to be the same for all types of couplings .",
    "we have decided to take : @xmath527 and by energy conservation we have of course @xmath528 .",
    "@xmath1 is the typical energy scale of the interaction process , and is the quantity to be varied to get rg flows .",
    "it is a bit more difficult to choose the external momenta , because of the warping of the fermi surface .",
    "our choice has been dictated by a few natural requirements .",
    "first the symmetries of the fermi surfaceshould be respected , as the right - left symmetry , the up - down symmetry ( i.e.@xmath529 , in terms of the original transverse momenta ) .",
    "interactions processes for which it is possible to choose all external momenta on the fermi surface , should be computed for this special choice , because it would otherwise mean the introduction of a spurious energy scale .",
    "let us first consider @xmath530 .",
    "it is possible to choose @xmath531 , @xmath532 , @xmath533 , and @xmath534 , only if momentum conservation @xmath535 is respected . in general , this will not be possible , for we will have @xmath536 .",
    "notice that up to a minus sign and a factor of 2 , @xmath537 is simply the generalization of @xmath209 in the two - chain model .",
    "it is then natural to split this quantity equally among the four momenta .",
    "one can check that the following choice fulfills all the conditions we have mentioned : @xmath538    for the umklapps , the choice of external momenta is dictated by the same requirements .",
    "the equivalent of @xmath537 is now @xmath539 , and the natural choice of momenta reads : @xmath540    the next task is to draw all possible feynman diagrams , and compute them .",
    "one can then establish the field theoretical rg flows , requiring the couplings measured at two different scales should correspond to the same high - energy theory .",
    "the couplings flow equations are given in appendix [ app : flow_eq_coup ] , and are obtained in the one - loop approximation . as argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : csfs ] , the most interesting effects connected to fermi surfacedeformation appear at the two - loop level for the single - electron propagator . for the sake of simplicity , we shall use a hybrid scheme , involving a one - loop approximation for the couplings and a two - loop approximation for the electronic self - energy . in the case where all the couplings remain weak",
    ", it is reasonable to keep only the dominant term in the corresponding flow equation .",
    "if by contrast couplings have a tendency to grow and become large at low energies , experience from the kondo problem suggests adding the subleading terms to the couplings flow does not provide a better physical picture .",
    "for the kondo problem , the two - loop approximation predicts an intermediate coupling fixed point,@xcite whereas the low - energy physics corresponds to an infinite coupling fixed point.@xcite    we shall not give any technical detail on the derivation of these couplings flow equations which is standard.@xcite the main new feature is the use of special sets of external momenta , described in eqs .",

    "in fact , the `` true '' rg equations do not involve this function , but rather : @xmath544 it is obvious that these @xmath545 diverge for @xmath546 , so that some couplings will diverge or vanish singularly at the scales given in ( [ eq : car_length_1 ] ) to ( [ eq : car_length_9 ] ) .",
    "though this physically signals the crossing of the characteristic scales , it is practically unpleasant for the numerical simulations . furthermore , if we did not work at zero temperature , the energy scale given by the temperature @xmath547 would suppress these divergences .",
    "notice that the presence of @xmath548 factors also implies that the couplings will not remain real .",
    "for all these reasons , it is thus natural to try to find a way to get rid of these singular behaviors .",
