    "while the rapid rotation ( v@xmath3/v@xmath4 @xmath270 - 80% of their critical velocity ; @xcite ) of classical be stars has long been speculated to be the fundamental source driving the production of their geometrically thin circumstellar disks @xcite , recent photometric surveys @xcite have suggested secondary mechanisms might contribute to the observed phenomenon .",
    "specifically , @xcite and @xcite found that the frequency of the be phenomenon seems to peak in clusters with a main sequence turn - off of b1-b2 , leading to the suggestion that the be phenomenon is enhanced with evolutionary age .",
    "several recent observational studies @xcite have also suggested that the be phenomenon may be more prevalent in low metallicity environments , based on comparisons of the fractional be populations of galactic , lmc , and smc clusters .    in @xcite ( hereafter wb06 )",
    ", we used a simple 2-color diagram ( 2-cd ) technique to identify the fractional candidate be population of numerous large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , and galactic clusters in an effort to improve the statistical database which has been used to link classical be disk formation with evolutionary age and/or metallicity .",
    "wb06 found evidence that the be phenomenon develops much earlier than previously predicted by theory @xcite , i.e before the mid - point main sequence lifetime ; furthermore , they found evidence of an additional enhancement in the fractional be content of clusters with evolutionary age .",
    "the increased statistics offered by this work , while confirming the previously suggested trend of an enhancement in the be phenomenon in low metallicity environments , lowered the average fractional be content of smc clusters from 39% @xcite to 32% .",
    "while the 2-cd has been widely used to link evolutionary age and/or metallicity with be disk formation , it is inherently unclear whether all b - type objects identified as excess h@xmath0 emitters , i.e. `` be stars '' , are truly classical be stars .",
    "it has been noted that other b - type objects , such as herbig ae / be stars , post - main - sequence b[e ] stars , and supergiants , may also exhibit h@xmath0 emission hence `` contaminate '' these claimed detections ( wb06 ) .",
    "polarimetry is a tool which has long been used to investigate the circumstellar environments of be stars @xcite .",
    "electron scattering in the innermost region of classical be circumstellar disks will polarize a small fraction of stellar photons ; furthermore , pre- and post - scattering attenuation by hydrogen atoms within the inner disk region will imprint a characteristic wavelength dependence onto this polarization signature if the inner disk is sufficiently dense @xcite .",
    "the wavelength dependence of intrinsic polarization originating from classical be stars , characterized by geometrically thin , gaseous circumstellar disks , @xcite is significantly different than that expected from the dustier circumstellar environments of herbig ae / be stars , post - main - sequence b[e ] stars , and supergiants @xcite .",
    "thus for non - pole - on disk geometries , polarimetry can be employed to investigate circumstellar environments and discriminate the evolutionary nature of sources .    in this paper , we use imaging polarimetry to investigate the true nature of candidate be stars in six lmc and six smc clusters which were initially identified via photometric 2-cds . in section 2 , we outline our observations and data reduction techniques . in section 3 ,",
    "we detail how we identified and removed the interstellar polarization component associated with each of our lines of sight .",
    "we develop a classification system to characterize the intrinsic polarization observed in our candidate be star sample in section 4 and also discuss the results of individual clusters .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results in section 5 and summarize our work in section 6 .",
    "the imaging polarimetry data presented in this study were obtained at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 1.5 m .",
    "the f/7.5 secondary configuration was used during our 2001 observing run , which yielded a 15 x 15 arc - minute field of view and a 0.44 arc - second pixel@xmath5 scale , while the f/13.5 secondary configuration , which provided a 8 x 8 arc - minute field of view with a 0.24 arc - second pixel@xmath5 scale , was used during our 2002 observing run .",
    "data were recorded with ctio s standard cassegrain focus ccd ( cfccd ) , a 2048 x 2048 multi - amplifier ccd .",
    "the standard cfccd configuration was modified by the addition of a rotatable half - wave plate followed by a fixed analyzer , the latter of which was placed in the upper of the 1.5 m s two filter wheels .",
    "the polymer achromatic wave - plate was manufactured by meadowlark optics and provided polarization modulation for each 90@xmath6 rotation of the wave - plate . unless otherwise noted , each of our fields of view was observed with the wave - plate rotated through 8 positions 22.5@xmath6 apart . the fixed analyzer was a double calcite block whose",
    "optical axes had been crossed to minimize astigmatism and color effects .",
    "further details about this polarimeter can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , & @xcite .",
    "we placed ctio s tek u , b , v , r , and i filters in the second filter wheel .",
    "a summary of the science clusters we observed is presented in table [ polexpose ] .",
    "nightly observations of polarization standard stars were obtained to calibrate the polarimetric efficiency of each filter and determine the zero - point of the polarization position angle in each filter , while nightly observations of unpolarized standard stars were obtained to characterize any instrumental polarization present .",
    "our unpolarized standard data indicate that the polarimeter had an instrumental polarization consistent with zero for our 2001 data .",
    "the b , v , r , and i filters of our 2002 data also had an instrumental polarization consistent with zero @xcite , while the u filter data had an instrumental polarization of @xmath20.1% , which was removed from the data .",
    "the reduction of these data began with standard image processing , including bias and flat field corrections , using standard iraf techniques . following this initial processing ,",
    "aperture photometry was performed for all point sources in each of the 8 images of an observation set , using 10 apertures of size 3 - 12 pixels for the f/7.5 data and 5 - 14 pixels for the f/13.5 data .",
    "the linear polarization of each source was extracted from a least squares solution of the difference amplitudes in the 8 wave - plate positions ( @xmath7 ) , using the pccdpack software suite @xcite .",
    "both the expected photon noise errors and the actual measured errors , defined as the residuals at each wave - plate position with respect to the expected @xmath8 curve , were also calculated . with few exceptions ,",
    "these two errors were consistent with one another .",
    "the polarization observed in our raw data is comprised of the superposition of an interstellar component , attributable to the dichroic absorption of starlight by partially aligned dust grains along each line of sight , and possibly an intrinsic component , attributable to the asymmetric illumination of circumstellar material and/or the illumination of an asymmetrical distribution of circumstellar material . characterizing and isolating each of these components , although often technically challenging , yields two unique diagnostics . isolating the interstellar polarization component can facilitate detailed studies of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) and provide constraints on fundamental properties such as grain size distributions and shapes , as well as diagnosing the magnitude and direction of local magnetic fields .",
    "isolating the intrinsic polarization component enables investigations of the distribution and chemistry of scatterers which comprise unresolved circumstellar environments .",
    "we stress that characterizing the polarizing agent ( i.e. gas or dust ) responsible for producing an intrinsic polarization signal is not possible simply via inspection of the wavelength dependence of the vector sum of interstellar plus intrinsic ( i.e. the total ) polarization data .",
    "fortunately , our efforts to identify and separate the interstellar and intrinsic polarization components of our data are simplified by the fact that we have observed rich stellar associations .",
    "most of the stars in these clusters should be normal main sequence stars lacking any type of asymmetrical circumstellar envelope , hence they should not exhibit an intrinsic polarization component .",
    "furthermore , we can assume that all of our stars are located at the same general distance , since they are members of a cluster population , and that the properties of the interstellar medium do not significantly vary over the angular extent of our clusters .",
    "hence each cluster in our sample provides us with a multitude of suitable `` field stars '' whose polarization we can simply average to estimate the interstellar polarization ( isp ) along each line of sight , via the commonly used field star technique @xcite .    in figure [ 1818vsel ]",
    "we show the total v - band polarization of all sources in the lmc cluster ngc 1818 having polarimetric signal - to - noise ratios ( p/@xmath9 ) greater than 5.0 .",
    "the distinctive grouping of most objects in the stokes q - u diagram of this figure ( panel a ) and the narrow polarization ( panel d ) and position angle ( panel c ) histograms demonstrates that most of these objects do lack significant intrinsic polarization components and only have an isp component . after excluding objects outside of the dominant trends found in these histograms with an iterative method , we calculated the weighted average and standard deviation of these data to determine a preliminary estimate of this cluster s v - band isp , as shown in figure [ 1818serkv ] .",
    "the wavelength dependence of these estimates clearly follow the empirical serkowski law @xcite commonly used to parameterize an isp .",
    "over - plotted in figure [ 1818serkv ] is a modified serkowski law @xcite which we deemed best represented the observational data .",
    "the polarization at the midpoint wavelength location of the u , b , v , r , and i filters was then extracted from this curve and served as the final estimate of the isp .",
    "the modified serkowski parameters determined for all of our lines of sight , along with the extracted filter isp values , are summarized in table [ isptable ] .",
    "the isp values compiled in table [ isptable ] are relevant to our efforts to isolate the intrinsic polarization components associated with our target stars ; however , they do not yet yield any direct information regarding the properties of the interstellar dust grains which reside in their parent lmc and smc clusters , as these isp values are comprised of both foreground galactic isp and magellanic cloud isp contributions . following the techniques used by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we used the interstellar polarization maps of @xcite , to identify and remove this foreground galactic isp contribution ( see table [ foreground ] ) , hence determine estimates of the isp intrinsic to our lmc and smc clusters ( see table [ ispintrin ] ) .",
    "we used a modified serkowski - law @xcite to extrapolate these maps over the wavelength range of our dataset , and assumed a nominal galactic @xmath1 value of 5500  to characterize the parameter k. the errors cited in the galactic polarization maps @xcite and those present in our total isp estimates ( table [ isptable ] ) were propagated to produce the error estimates cited in table [ ispintrin ] .",
    "most of the field stars used to derive our total isp estimates were not highly reddened objects , hence the intrinsic lmc and smc isp values listed in table [ ispintrin ] all are characterized by modest polarization amplitudes , which are often on the order of the errors of our data . in spite of this fact , trends in these data are clearly present . as expected",
    ", the magnitude of ubvri polarization towards each cluster follows a serkowski - like wavelength dependence at a wavelength independent position angle .",
    "this lack of position angle rotation indicates that our galactic interstellar polarization correction was reasonable and that we are looking at a single magnetic field orientation towards each of our clusters .",
    "all lmc clusters exhibit similar isp properties , with polarization magnitudes ranging from @xmath20.2 - 0.5% at a position angle of @xmath225 - 45 degrees ; similarly , all smc clusters also exhibit clear evidence of sharing common isp properties , with polarization magnitudes ranging from @xmath20.3 - 0.6% at a position angle of @xmath2120 - 150 degrees .",
    "the shallow curvature of the serkowski - law dependence of these data , in combination with the moderate level of uncertainty present , make identifying systematic differences in the interstellar dust grain properties of these clusters difficult .",
    "the total isp ( table [ isptable ] ) and smc isp ( table [ ispintrin ] ) of the cluster ngc 330 does however show suggestive evidence of being characterized by a short wavelength @xmath1 value of @xmath24500   ( figure [ 330serk ] ) .",
    "such an effect is commonly attributed to the presence of small dust grains , and has been previously observed in other smc sight - lines @xcite . in a future paper , we will examine the wavelength dependence of moderately and highly reddened objects in our dataset to perform a more detailed investigation of the interstellar medium properties of these lmc and smc clusters , and compliment earlier studies which parameterized the ism properties of other smc @xcite and lmc @xcite sight - lines .",
    "the total polarization vectors of our observations of the lmc cluster ngc 2100 clearly exhibit evidence of a collective , complex morphology ( see figure [ rawn2100i ] ) .",
    "while figure [ rawn2100i ] only presents i - band data , all of our other filters exhibit similar alignment patterns . recall that we expect",
    "most cluster objects should not exhibit an intrinsic polarization component ; thus we suggest that these systematic morphological changes are related to changes in the magnetic field properties within our field of view .",
    "a substantial discussion of the magnetic field properties of ngc 2100 is presented in @xcite . for the purposes of the present study",
    ", we will only discuss our efforts to parameterize and remove the isp along the line of sight to this cluster .",
    "we identified three spatial regions in our field of view , corresponding to the region around the cluster core , the region to the south of the cluster core , and the region to the north of the core , which displayed unique isp characteristics . in figures",
    "[ n2100region1isp ] , [ n2100region2isp ] , and [ n2100region3isp ] , we show the b - band polarization vector maps of what we have defined as regions 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively in the total isp along the line of sight to ngc 2100 , overlaid on dss-2 blue images .",
    "having identified these distinct regions , we then extracted total isp estimates following the technique previously described .",
    "we calculated a @xmath10 weighted average of all objects in each filter served as an initial isp estimate , determined the modified serkowski - law parameters which best represented the data , as seen in figure [ n2100region1serk ] for region 1 , and extracted final isp values ( table [ isptable2 ] ) for each region from these serkowski curves .",
    "the locations of the candidate be stars in ngc 2100 were then correlated to these 3 isp regions to determine the isp correction each should receive .",
    "we found ngc 2100:kwbbe 102 , 630 , and 712 resided in area 2 , ngc 2100:kwbbe 535 , 797 , and 1033 resided in area 3 , and the rest of the candidate be stars resided in area 1 .",
    "we subtracted the isp from the observed polarization to isolate any intrinsic polarization components present .",
    "the location of candidate be stars in our fields of view were identified by careful correlation with literature coordinates and finder charts .",
    "using several pccdpack routines , we meticulously examined the extracted polarization for each of the candidate be stars in our sample to search for undesired contamination by a ) the ordinary or extraordinary images of nearby objects and b ) cosmic ray hits or uncorrected bad pixels .",
    "the total polarization of all candidate be stars which did not suffer from these contamination issues are tabulated in table [ totpol ] , while the intrinsic polarization of these objects are tabulated in table [ inpol ] .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , electron scattering in the pure gas disks of classical be stars will polarize a small fraction of stellar photons , producing a well known wavelength dependent intrinsic polarization signature .",
    "we emphasize that as polarization is a vector quantity , identifying these signatures a ) is only possible via inspection of intrinsic polarization data ; and b ) requires either the _ simultaneous _ inspection of both the wavelength dependence of the polarization magnitude _ and _ position angle , or alternatively inspection of the behavior of the intrinsic data on a stokes q - u diagram .",
    "an observed wavelength independent intrinsic polarization magnitude and position angle across the entire ubvri wavelength regime is the expected signature of pure electron scattering , such as that expected from a gaseous classical be disk .",
    "moreover , pre- or post - scattering absorption will superimpose the wavelength dependent signature of hydrogen opacity on this signal , creating a `` saw - tooth '' polarization signature @xcite , if enough absorption events occur .",
    "specifically , this `` saw - tooth '' signature includes the presence of abrupt jumps in the magnitude of intrinsic polarization at the balmer and paschen limits , as well as a wavelength independent intrinsic polarization position angle across the entire ubvri wavelength regime .",
    "examples of these two signatures of classical be circumstellar disks are given in figure [ pbopiaqr ] , which presents multi - epoch observations of the known classical be star pi aquarii as observed by the university of wisconsin s hpol spectropolarimeter .",
    "we have contemporaneously analyzed the stokes q - u diagrams of all candidate be stars total and intrinsic polarization components to search for evidence of these signatures .",
    "we have developed a conservative 4-point classification scale to rank the likelihood that candidate be stars are truly classical be stars .",
    "results of this classification are summarized in table [ starclass ] for individual objects and in table [ polsummary ] for the net results of entire clusters .",
    "the design of our classification system emphasized the identification of objects exhibiting a `` saw - tooth '' intrinsic polarization signature and a pure electron scattering signature across the _ entire _ ubvri wavelength regime .",
    "specifically , we defined our classification system by :    * * type-1 : * objects which are _ most likely _ classical be stars ; * * type-2 : * objects whose polarimetric properties are _ not inconsistent _ with those expected from classical be stars ; * * type-3 : * objects which are _ unlikely _ to be classical be stars ; and * * type-4 : * objects which are _ highly unlikely _ to be classical be stars .",
    "stars in our sample which displayed , to within 3 @xmath11 , a `` sawtooth - like '' polarization balmer jump ( bj ) along with a wavelength independent polarization position angle across the entire range of available data ( see figure [ polbal ] ) were assigned a designation of type-1 .",
    "we claim that all type-1 objects are most likely classical be stars .",
    "note that we offer a detailed discussion of other objects which could exhibit somewhat similar behavior over _ part _ of the ubvri wavelength regime in section [ bevshaebe ] .",
    "however , as we discuss in section [ nircolors ] , analysis of ancillary data demonstrates that it is highly dubious that stars classified as type-1 polarimetric sources are anything other than classical be stars .",
    "we assigned a designation of type-2 to objects whose polarimetric properties were not inconsistent with that expected from a classical be star - disk system .",
    "as previously discussed , classical be disks of sufficiently low density will not leave an imprint of hydrogen opacity in their intrinsic polarization signals ; hence , stars which exhibited , to within 3@xmath11 , a wavelength independent electron scattering ( es ) polarization signature ( see figure [ poles ] ) received a designation of type-2 .",
    "a small number of objects exhibited a nearly wavelength independent polarization magnitude along with a minor wavelength dependence in their polarization position angles ; we designated these objects as type-2 as we believe such stars most likely are exhibiting es signatures modified by a slight under- or over - correction of their isp components .",
    "we can not rule out that this minor wavelength dependence might also be produced by the additional presence of an optically thin dust disk , as present in post - main - sequence b[e ] stars @xcite .",
    "however , as we show in section [ nircolors ] , analysis of ancillary data demonstrate that most type-2 objects which we claim exhibit electron - scattering ( es ) signatures are likely to be classical be stars , and substantially less likely to be systems characterized by composite gas plus dust disks ( i.e. herbig ae / be , b[e ] stars ) . finally , we assigned all objects which appeared to be intrinsically unpolarized ( @xmath12 0.3% polarization ) , to within 3@xmath11 , a type-2 designation as this is the expected signature of pole - on or nearly pole - on classical be stars .",
    "we caution the reader that we are not 100% certain that these unpolarized objects are classical be stars as : a ) stars without gaseous disks , spuriously detected as excess h@xmath0 emitters on 2-cds , will also exhibit zero net intrinsic polarization and b ) the noise present in the observations of fainter targets may preclude us from clearly identifying them as `` contaminants '' .",
    "we assigned the designation of type-3 to type-4 to objects whose polarization , to within 3@xmath11 , appeared to be inconsistent with the aforementioned signatures expected from a classical be star - disk system ( see e.g. figure [ polunlikely ] ) . we briefly discuss some of the major types of atypical polarimetric signatures we observed .    in table",
    "[ starclass ] , we assigned a designation of type 3 - 4 to several objects whose intrinsic polarization exhibited signs of a 90@xmath6 position angle reversal ( figure [ n2100intrin111 ] ) , which is a signature of a dusty bipolar nebula geometry ( see section [ bevshaebe ] ; see also @xcite ) . from an inspection of the stokes q - u diagram of such an object ( figure [ n2100intrin111 ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that even if our initial isp correction was grossly miscalculated , the wavelength dependent polarization would still be inconsistent with that expected from classical be stars . while it would be interesting to further probe the circumstellar environments of such objects with follow - up investigations , for the purposes of this paper we merely remark that they are unlikely to be classical be stars .",
    "several of our candidate be stars exhibited very large ( 1 - 3.5% ) , complex intrinsic polarization signatures ( see figure [ n1948serklong ] ) .",
    "given the steep drop in their polarization magnitude at short optical wavelengths , along with subtle indications of a corresponding position angle rotation , it is possible that these objects are characterized by dusty bipolar nebulae whose polarization signature exhibits a position angle reversal at uv wavelengths , similar to hd 45677 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the polarization of these objects could be interpreted as following a serkowski - like wavelength dependence characterized by a large @xmath1 value .",
    "as our data have already been corrected for the average isp associated with each of our clusters , this latter interpretation would require these objects to be situated in region of patchy dust , likely populated by larger grains given the long wavelength values of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath13 7000   in figure [ n1948serklong ] @xcite .",
    "@xcite described the expected magnitude of interstellar polarization by the formulation @xmath14 ; hence , an additional reddening of 0.3 - 1.0 e@xmath15 would be required to produce the measured p@xmath16 of these objects , @xmath23% .",
    "the observed colors of at least some of these objects ( ngc 1948:kwbbe 98 , v - i = 0.67 ; keller et al . 1999 ) is likely sufficient to produce the amount of purported additional isp , although other objects ( ngc 1948:kwbbe 246 , v - i = 0.05 ; keller et al .",
    "1999 ) clearly do not meet this criteria . while follow - up optical or infrared spectroscopy of these anomalous candidates would help to determine whether they exhibit a dusty bipolar nebula geometry or are located in a region of patchy dust , for the purpose of this paper we merely stress that it is clear that these objects are not likely to be classical be stars .",
    "we now offer discussion of the polarimetric properties of candidate be stars in individual clusters .",
    "recall that all candidates which exhibited evidence of contamination , predominantly from nearby neighbors , have been excluded from our analysis .",
    "we further note that the effective limiting magnitude of our polarimetric dataset was lower ( i.e. brighter ) than that considered in wb06 .",
    "@xcite identified 40 candidate be stars associated with the lmc cluster ngc 1818 and its surrounding field .",
    "the cluster is densely populated , and because of image overlap issues , we were only able to retrieve polarimetric information for 18 of these candidate be stars .",
    "4 of these 18 ( 22% ) showed intrinsic polarization balmer jump ( bj ) signatures , ngc 1818:kwbbe 69 , 82 , 137 , 243 .",
    "we classified 12 of the 18 candidates ( 67% ) as type-2 objects , and found 5 of the type-2 objects ( i.e. 5 of the 18 stars , 28% , in the total population ) exhibited clear evidence of an electron scattering ( es ) polarization signature .",
    "2 of the 18 candidates ( 11% ) , ngc 1818:kwbbe 47 and 381 , were deemed unlikely to be classical be stars . while the b , v , r , and i filter polarization of ngc 1818:kwbbe 47 were consistent with an es signature , the u filter exhibited a significant position angle rotation which was inconsistent with an es origin .",
    "although noisy , the observation of ngc 1818:kwbbe 381 also did not follow an es wavelength dependence , prompting us to assign it an `` unlikely be star '' designation .",

    "the hpol spectropolarimeter @xcite mounted on the university of wisconsin s pine bluff observatory ( pbo ) has been monitoring the optical spectropolarimetric properties of a sample of 73 known galactic be stars , and it provides a statistically significant polarimetric dataset which we will use to aid the interpretation of our results . as yet , most of the @xmath2800 hpol observations of classical be stars have not had their isp components identified and removed ; hence , we can not readily compare their intrinsic polarization characteristics to our data .",

    "data obtained prior to 1995 have been compiled in catalog form by @xcite , and observations characterized by a polarization balmer jump have already been flagged in the catalog .",
    "we have similarly analyzed all observations obtained from 1995 - 2004 to identify the presence of polarimetric balmer jumps in these data .",
    "we then compiled all hpol observations of individual classical be stars into two categories : a ) classical be stars which had * never * exhibited a polarimetric balmer jump in any pbo observation ; and b ) classical be stars which had exhibited a polarimetric balmer jump in at least one observation .",
    "the results of this classification procedure are given in table [ polsum3 ] .",
    "we found 31 of the 73 ( 42% ) observed galactic be stars exhibited a polarimetric balmer jump for at least part of the time - frame of the hpol survey .",
    "amongst early - type be stars ( o9-b5 ) in the hpol database , 22 of 45 ( 49% ) exhibited polarimetric balmer jumps .",
    "note that further restricting the sample to include only o9-b3 type be stars does not appreciably affect the observed prevalence of polarization balmer jumps , as 17 of 40 ( 43% ) exhibited such a signature .",
    "in contrast , the prevalence of polarization balmer jumps does seem to be noticeably lower for later - type ( b6-a0 ) be stars , as we found only 8 of 26 ( 31% ) exhibited evidence of a polarimetric balmer jump .",
    "the frequency of polarization balmer jumps appears to decrease with metallicity : @xmath245% of galactic be stars in the hpol database , @xmath225% of lmc be stars from the present study , and @xmath24% of smc be stars from the present study exhibit polarization balmer jumps .",
    "we suggest several possible explanations for these results .    1 .",
    "it is possible that the average disk properties of classical be stars are fundamentally different in the low metallicity environments of the smc and lmc as compared to our galaxy .",
    "the presence of intrinsic polarization in classical be stars , as well as its wavelength dependence , is a function of disk inclination angle , disk density , and the effective temperature of disk material .",
    "thus the observed lower frequency of polarization balmer jumps in our data suggest either that it might be harder to form massive disk systems in low metallicity environments or that the average disk temperature is higher in these lower metallicity environments , hence decreasing the amount of pre- and post - scattering absorption by neutral h i. 2 .",
    "our polarimetric observations provided a one time sampling of lmc and smc candidate be stars , while the hpol survey obtained a larger number of observations , albeit at quasi - random intervals , of a population of known be stars .",
    "owing to the variable nature of the be phenomenon , we do not a priori know how often any individual be star will exhibit any of the possible polarization signatures ; hence , the different sampling errors associated with these two databases might explain at least some of the observed differences in the polarization balmer jump frequencies .",
    "the statistics presented in table [ polsum3 ] were based on removing a significant number of objects deemed unlikely to be classical be stars from consideration , i.e. type-3 and type-4 objects .",
    "recall however that our definition of type-2 objects only required their polarimetric properties to be not inconsistent with those expected from classical be stars .",
    "it is possible that a population of `` contaminants '' , either a ) unpolarized objects which are nt pole - on or near pole - on classical be stars ; or b ) non - classical be stars which were not identified as such due to low data quality , still reside within our collection of type-2 objects , hence underestimate our polarization balmer jump fraction frequency .",
    "if such a scenario is true , it would further suggest that extreme caution should be exercised when assessing the nature of stellar populations purely via the use of photometric 2-cds .",
    "wb06 identified a large number of b - type objects having excess h@xmath0 emission via photometric 2-cds and suggested that these stars be classified as candidate be stars .",
    "d. gies ( 2006 , personal communication ) noted that several candidate be stars in the wb06 dataset had colors redder than that expected from classical be stars , and suggested that the frequency of observed blue ( or red ) excess h@xmath0 emitters in the 2-color diagrams presented in wb06 increased with the total number of stars of a given color range .",
    "furthermore , he postulated that if these red excess emitters were a ) a manifestation of extremely young stars with their birth disks still intact , b ) red - type giants or supergiants , or c ) false detections owing from the effects of bright background h ii emission ; measuring the prevalence of these excess emitters could serve as an estimate of the number of `` contaminants '' which affect the blue population of excess h@xmath0 emitters , i.e. the candidate be star population .",
    "we examined the 2-cd photometry of 6 clusters , common to both this survey and that of wb06 and spanning a wide range of ages ( very young , young , old ; wb06 ) and metallicities ( smc , lmc ) , and determined the frequency of excess red - type h@xmath0 emitters relative to the total number of red - type stars .",
    "we restricted our analysis such that the magnitude of ( b - v ) colors used to identify candidate be stars in each cluster ( i.e. @xmath2 -0.3 @xmath12 ( b - v ) @xmath12 0.2 in ngc 458 , wb06 ) matched the range of ( b - v ) colors used to study the frequency of red - type excess emitters ( i.e. 0.2 @xmath12 ( b - v ) @xmath12 0.7 for ngc 458 ) .",
    "furthermore , we adopted the same ( r - h@xmath0 ) cutoffs delineating excess emitters from normal stars for each cluster as used by wb06 .",
    "the results of this exercise are tabulated in column 2 of table [ photcontam ] .",
    "interestingly , with few exceptions , the frequency of potential `` contaminants '' implied by this technique is generally consistent with the minimum rate of contamination derived from our polarization results ( see column 3 of table [ photcontam ] , column 6 of table [ polsummary ] ) , i.e. the candidates we assigned a type 4 classification .",
    "clearly this photometric contamination check can not provide a diagnostic on the be classification of individual objects , unlike our polarimetry ; however , we suggest that this technique might provide a rough estimate of the role of contaminants in cases in which detailed follow - up observations have not been made or are unfeasible",
    ".      one of the interesting results presented in wb06 was the identification of candidate be star in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr , in an abundance similar to the general frequency of the be phenomenon in our galaxy , @xmath217% .",
    "however , it was uncertain based on those results whether the detected excess h@xmath0 emitters a ) were true classical be star - disk systems ; b ) were b - type objects which still possessed remnant star - formation disks , i.e. herbig be stars ; or c ) merely had diffuse h@xmath0 nebulosity coincidentally associated with them .",
    "our intrinsic polarimetric dataset affords us the opportunity to further constrain the evolutionary status of candidate be stars in four clusters of age 5 - 8 myr , lh 72 , ngc 1858 , ngc 346 , and ngc 371 .      as discussed in the introduction , section [ intrinpolsection ] , and references therein , it is well accepted that classical be stars are characterized by geometrically thin gas disks , and the mechanism responsible for producing their intrinsic polarization is electron scattering .",
    "herbig be stars are more complex systems in that their circumstellar environments contain both gas and dust .",
    "dominant _ polarigenic mechanism in herbig be stars is well established to be scattering by dust , as outlined in the review papers of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and numerous references therein .",
    "while herbig be and classical be stars exhibit some similar observational traits , such as the presence of an intrinsic , often variable , polarization component @xcite , the different scattering mechanisms which characterize herbig be versus classical be stars manifest themselves in several observational manners .",
    "the magnitude of linear polarization of classical be stars is typically of order 1% or less @xcite , whereas the average ( @xmath23% ) and maximum ( 14.5% ) polarization observed in herbig ae / be stars is clearly much larger @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the different scattering mechanisms which dominate in each of these star - disk systems will produce a different wavelength dependence in these stars intrinsic polarization .",
    "the characteristic wavelength dependent intrinsic polarization signature of classical be stars has already been documented in section [ intrinpolsection ] .",
    "herbig be stars are not known to exhibit any singular `` characteristic '' intrinsic polarization behavior ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; the grain chemistry , grain size distribution , and relative size and extent of the gas and dust disks / envelopes of individual herbig be systems likely contributes to the heterogeneous mix of observed intrinsic polarization .",
    "some typical intrinsic polarization trends are observed in herbig ae / be stars however , most notably rotations ( and dramatic 90@xmath6 reversals ) in the intrinsic polarization position angle @xcite .",
    "we remark that several literature works which describe and interpret the wavelength dependence of intrinsic polarization from herbig be stars , and at times attempt to draws parallels with the intrinsic polarization behavior of classical be stars , should be viewed with caution .",
    "for example , as noted by @xcite , both @xcite and @xcite employ dubious assumptions in their efforts to constrain the interstellar polarization along the line of sight to their herbig be stars , and as such the wavelength dependence of the `` intrinsic '' polarization they report is likely inaccurate .",
    "similarly , the discussion of the wavelength dependence of intrinsic polarization of the herbig be star bd+61 154 in @xcite ( see their figure 2 ) ignores the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic polarization position angle .",
    "the @xmath240@xmath6 intrinsic polarization position angle rotation from the b to i filter in these data is inconsistent with the expected signature of a pure gas disk system ; the wavelength dependence of intrinsic polarization from this herbig be star is not similar to that observed for classical be stars .",
    "although dust scattering is the dominant polarigenic agent for herbig be stars , it is still possible to detect evidence of the gaseous inner disk component of some of these systems via polarimetry @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite presents intrinsic spectropolarimetry of the herbig be star mwc349a covering the wavelength range @xmath25000 - 10500  ( v , r , i filters ) , which exhibits both line depolarization effects and a paschen polarization jump ( see their figure 7 ) , similar to that observed in the classical be star zeta tau @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest electron scattering as the mechanism responsible for producing these specific features .",
    "evidence of the dusty component of mwc349a s composite disk is also evident in these data .",
    "specifically , the 30 - 40@xmath6 rotation in the intrinsic continuum polarization position angle , beginning at @xmath26200   and extending to the blue edge of the available data , @xmath25000  indicates the presence of an additional scattering mechanism which becomes more pronounced at shorter wavelengths , i.e. dust scattering .    based on the available literature , we are aware of no compelling examples of herbig be stars whose intrinsic polarization magnitude _ and _ position angle fully follow the known ubvri behavior of classical be stars . while neither typical nor likely , we can not rule out the possibility that one could in principle observe a balmer jump signature in the polarization magnitude of _ some _ herbig be stars , as these systems do have composite gas plus dust disks .",
    "however , as dust scattering is the dominant polarigenic scattering agent in herbig be stars , it is dubious that the entire ubvri intrinsic polarization magnitude and position angle of such systems would exhibit no evidence of a non - electron scattering component .",
    "moreover , as astutely pointed out by our referee , it would be even more unlikely to observe one of our `` type 2 electron scattering ( es ) signatures '' in any herbig be star , unless the dust grain chemistry and size distribution would conspire to produce grey scattering .",
    "hence , the ubvri spectral range of the intrinsic polarization data presented in this paper enables us to discriminate deviations from a pure electron scattering signature over a broad spectral range .",
    "this allows us to differentiate herbig be stars analogous to mwc 349a , whose gaseous disk dominates a portion of the optical polarimetric regime , and herbig be stars whose dust disks dominate the optical polarimetric regime , from classical be stars .      as noted in wb06 , many of the candidate be stars identified in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr reside nearby or even within regions characterized by diffuse nebular emission .",
    "we consider whether the observed characteristic polarimetric signatures of classical be stars , both electron scattering and balmer jump polarization features , could merely be artifacts of this background emission .",
    "such polarization signatures are only produced when the electron scattering optical depth is @xmath21.0 , i.e. , that present in the innermost disk region of classical be stars .",
    "the density of any coincident diffuse h@xmath0 nebulosity present around candidate be stars is vastly insufficient to create such a polarization signature .",
    "thus while some of the `` be star '' detections made by h@xmath0 spectroscopic surveys @xcite have been shown to be spurious detections due to the presence of coincident gas @xcite , such diffuse nebulosity can not be responsible for creating the polarimetric signals found in our dataset .      further insight into the evolutionary status of candidate",
    "be stars in our very young ( 5 - 8 myr ) clusters may be elicited via inspection of their near - ir colors .",
    "it has been shown that the fundamentally different composition of classical be disks ( gas ) and herbig ae / be disks ( gas and dust ) will generally result in these objects occupying distinctly different locations in ( j - h ) versus ( h - k ) near - ir 2-color diagrams @xcite , although minor instances of overlap are observed .",
    "as such , we cross - correlated all photometrically identified candidate be stars residing in clusters studied in this paper with the 2mass @xcite survey .",
    "targets for which we were able to extract full jhk photometric data are listed in table [ ircolor ] .",
    "we plot the 2mass jhk photometry of all available sources as a function of our polarimetric classifications in figure [ ir2cd ] ( with error bars ) and figure [ ir2cdnoe ] ( without error bars ) .",
    "our type-1 sources which exhibit polarimetric balmer jumps are plotted as red circles , our type-2 sources which exhibit es polarimetric signatures are plotted as green triangles , and all other candidate be stars ( other type-2 sources , type-3 sources , type-4 sources , and polarimetric non - detections ) are plotted as blue squares . for reference , we have also plotted the near - ir colors of 101 known galactic be stars tabulated by @xcite as filled black triangles , 21 lmc `` elhc '' stars which @xcite suggest are likely to be classical be stars as yellow open triangles , 2mass and ground - based @xcite colors of 13 magellanic cloud b[e ] stars known to have dusty disks as light blue crosses , and the star `` elhc-7 '' which @xcite suggest is likely to be a lmc herbig ae / be dusty star - disk system as a pink triangle .",
    "figures [ ir2cd ] and [ ir2cdnoe ] clearly demonstrate that most of the candidate be stars which we were able to correlate with the 2mass catalog do lie in a distinctly different region of the jhk 2-color diagram than that occupied by known dustier ( herbig ae / be or b[e ] ) systems . furthermore , although the magellanic cloud candidate be stars colors exhibit a wide dispersion , likely due in part to the considerable photometric errors of these faint sources ( figure [ ir2cd ] ; table [ ircolor ] ) , we find no clear distinction amongst the near - ir colors of our candidate be stars as a function of their polarimetric classification .",
    "a small number of candidate be stars marginally overlap with the location of dustier b[e ] sources , although these sources are within 3-@xmath11 of the mean locus of classical be colors .",
    "clearly better quality near - ir photometry of these sources should be pursued to better elucidate their evolutionary status .",
    "two candidate be stars clearly exhibit near - ir colors consistent with dusty disk systems , ngc 346:kwbbe 200 and ngc 456:wbbe 7 .",
    "ngc 346:kwbbe 200 was not detected in our polarimetric survey owing to contamination from a nearby source ; however , @xcite has recently published optical spectroscopic , near - ir photometric , and ir photometric observations of the target and concluded it is a b[e ] supergiant , not a classical be star .",
    "ngc 456:wbbe 7 was observed in our polarimetric survey and assigned a classification of type-3.5 . although noisy , our intrinsic polarization data exhibited marginal evidence of a position angle rotation , which could be indicative of a dusty envelope .",
    "the star s near - ir colors seems to verify this tentative interpretation .    for comparison",
    ", we also plotted the same near - ir colors for only candidate be stars residing in our very young ( 5 - 8 myr ) clusters in figure [ ir2cdvy ] .",
    "comparison of figures [ ir2cdnoe ] and [ ir2cdvy ] reveal no distinctive differences ; rather , it is quite clear that the vast majority of candidate be stars in these very young clusters have near - ir colors consistent with those expected from classical be stars and notably inconsistent with those expected from composite gas plus dust disk systems ( herbig ae / be and b[e ] stars ) .",
    "similar to figure [ ir2cdnoe ] , figure [ ir2cdvy ] reveals that there is no clear color difference amongst our various polarimetric classifications .",
    "we interpret these results as additional evidence that the many of the candidate be stars identified in clusters 5 - 8 myr old by wb06 are classical be stars , and not pre - main - sequence herbig be stars .",
    "the clearing time - scale of natal star formation material ( gas and dust ) will influence whether it is possible or likely , a - priori , to observe early - type herbig star - disk systems in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr . amongst the less massive herbig ae and t tauri stars ,",
    "the median lifetime of inner optically thick accretion disks is 2 - 3 myr , and although exceptions do exist , there is little to no h- and k - band evidence of primordial disks beyond a median stellar age of 5 myr @xcite .",
    "the typical natal disk dissipation for more massive stars is less well known . from a detailed study of the young cluster ngc 6611",
    ", @xcite suggested that the clearing of natal disk material around the more massive stars in this cluster was typically 0.1 myr or less .",
    "similarly , @xcite recently suggested that b0e star hd 53367 is a classical be star , based in part on an observed episodic loss of its disk material , a phenomenon known to characterize many classical be stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite also identified a 4 - 5 m@xmath17 pre - main - sequence binary companion which , given the pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks of @xcite , suggests the system s age is @xmath12 0.8 myr and indicates the natal gas plus dust disk of the b0e star hd 53367 must have dissipated at least on this time - scale .",
    "although clearly not conclusive , these results do suggest that it is reasonable to expect that most of the natal disks will have been cleared from the early b - type stars in our clusters of age 5 - 8 myr .",
    "wb06 and @xcite identified a large population of b - type stars in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr which exhibited an excess of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "observational studies suggest that the natal star formation disks of early b - type stars can clear on timescales of at least 0.1 - 0.8 myr , although it is admittedly not clear if this timescale is `` typical '' for all early - type b stars . the near - ir colors of many of the excess h@xmath0 emitters in these very young clusters are consistent with those expected from gaseous classical be stars and generally inconsistent with those observed from dustier b[e ] and/or herbig ae / be disk systems .",
    "the observed wavelength dependence of intrinsic polarization of many h@xmath0 excess stars in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr are also consistent with that expected from pure gas disk systems ( classical be stars ) and exhibit no evidence of secondary contributions from dust scattering , as would be expected for composite disk systems ( herbig ae / be , b[e ] stars ) . based on these factors",
    ", we suggest that there is compelling evidence supporting the existence of classical be stars in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr .",
    "as outlined and summarized in section [ polconcl ] , data presented in this paper support the suggestion of wb06 that classical be stars do develop before the mid - point main sequence lifetime of a b star . specifically , these data support the presence of a significant number of classical be stars , having crude photometric spectral types of b0-b5 ( wb06 ) , in clusters spanning a near - continuous range of ages from log(t ) of 6.7 - 8.1 , i.e. 5 - 126 myr . these results conflict with claims made by @xcite and @xcite",
    "that the be phenomenon develops in the second - half of a b star s main sequence lifetime .",
    "@xcite do suggest that massive be stars may briefly appear near the zams in the smc and lmc , before losing their `` be status '' until the very end of the first part of their main sequence lifetimes .",
    "we note that this conclusion was essentially based on a single cluster population , which limits its robustness .",
    "wb06 identified , and the intrinsic polarization presented in this paper support , the detection of a large body of magellanic cloud be stars having crude , photometrically - assigned spectral types of b0-b5 , in clusters spanning a range of ages from 5 - 126 myr . no abrupt absence of classical be stars was observed in any of the younger - type clusters of our photometric and/or polarimetric datasets .",
    "thus , our larger , more complete investigation of be stars in magellanic cloud clusters calls into question the suggestion that the be phenomenon is primarily restricted to the second - half of the main - sequence lifetime of b - stars @xcite and contradicts the appearance - disappearance - reappearance of the be phenomenon suggested by @xcite .",
    "wb06 first reported the presence of candidate classical be stars in clusters as young as 5 myr , and noted that if such objects were truly classical be stars , they would not have spent enough time on the main sequence to spin - up to near - critical rotation velocities via the mechanism proposed by @xcite or via mass transfer in a binary system @xcite .",
    "the confirmation of the classical be status of many of these stars via the present study can be interpreted as evidence that a significant number of classical be stars emerge onto the zero - age - main - sequence at near critical rotation velocities .",
    "an alternate interpretation of our results is that these youthful classical be stars are evidence of the existence of a subset of the be phenomenon which rotate at significantly sub - critical rates , perhaps as low as 0.4 - 0.6 v@xmath4 for early - type b stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that only a subset of early - type ( o7-b2 ) be stars might be sub - critical rotators , while later - type objects ( b3-a0 ) should be all near - critical rotators .",
    "our photometric survey of these very young clusters assigned crude spectral types to these candidate be stars of b0-b5 ( wb06 ) ; however , owing to detection biases in our follow - up polarimetric observations , we have in general only been able to confirm that portions of the brightest of these candidates ( i.e. the earliest spectral sub - types , b0 to @xmath2b3 ) are bona - fide classical be stars .",
    "thus our present observations do not rule out the possibility that some of our very young bona - fide classical be stars might belong to the sub - critical rotation population predicted by @xcite .",
    "the observed emergence of the be phenomenon earlier in the main sequence lifetime than previously thought also has important implications regarding the role of magnetic fields in the formation of be disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the transport of magnetic flux tubes in 9 m@xmath18 stars ( @xmath2b2.5-b3 ) and found these structures could rise from the core to the surface within the ( at the time ) expected beginning of the be phenomenon , the mid - point main sequence lifetime .",
    "the present study has confirmed the presence of bona - fide classical be stars in clusters as young as 5 myr having crude , photometrically assigned spectral types of b0 to @xmath2b3 .",
    "although wb06 suggested the presence of an additional population of b4-b5 type candidate be stars in these clusters , the limited dynamical range probed by the present study was unable to confirm the status of these fainter candidates .",
    "although the magnetic flux transport model of @xcite had sufficient time to transport flux to the stellar surface for @xmath2b3 stars , this is unlikely to be the case for later type stars ( @xmath19b4 ) which have a much thicker radiative envelope . hence , the existence of such later - type be stars in extremely young clusters would likely require an additional mechanism to be employed to accelerate the rise times of magnetic flux ( cassinelli , 2006 personal communication ) .",
    "while challenging , follow - up spectroscopy of these young cluster populations would provide one avenue confirm the presence of these purported @xcite later - type systems .",
    "while the present study provides significant advances in identifying and understanding the biases present in earlier 2-cd studies of cluster populations , additional work is clearly required .",
    "our polarimetric survey was not sensitive to pole - on or near - pole - on systems , hence determining which of our `` type-2 '' objects are near - pole - on classical be stars and which are astrophysical objects of a fundamentally different nature is a high priority .",
    "we suggest that followup moderate resolution optical spectroscopic or infrared photometric observations would provide reasonable diagnostics to resolve this bias , and enable more quantitative determinations of the bona - fide classical be content of clusters as a function of age and/or metallicity .",
    "our data suggest that at least 25% of photometrically identified candidate be stars appear unlikely to be true classical be stars ; however , we are unable to place firm constraints on the true astrophysical nature of such objects .",
    "we suggest that followup infrared photometric and/or spectroscopic observations would be useful to further constrain the evolutionary nature of these objects",
    ". furthermore , such observations would also be useful to ascertain the true nature of candidate be stars which were too faint to be reliably probed by our polarimetric observations .",
    "our analysis of the intrinsic polarization properties of lmc and smc classical be stars suggests that the fundamental disk properties of classical be stars may depend on metallicity .",
    "modeling followup moderate resolution spectropolarimetric observations of lmc / smc classical be stars is a clear avenue one could use to further investigate these results , and we note that the advent of accurate linear spectropolarimeters on large aperture telescopes ( i.e. the focal reducer spectrograph ( fors ) at the very large telescope ( vlt ) or the robert stobie spectrograph at the south african large telescope ( salt ) ) make obtaining such observations feasible .",
    "we have used imaging polarimetric observations of six lmc and six smc clusters to investigate the evolutionary status of b - type stars identified as excess h@xmath0 emitters via optical 2-color diagram photometric techniques .",
    "we characterized the interstellar polarization components of these data in a systematic manner , allowing us to isolate the intrinsic polarization properties of our data , hence constrain the dominant polarigenic agent in each system .",
    "we found :    1 .",
    "the interstellar polarization associated with ngc 330 was characterized by @xmath1 @xmath24500 , suggesting the presence of a small dust grain population ; 2 .",
    "the isp of ngc 2100 exhibited clear evidence of a complex morphology , indicating the presence of a non - uniform magnetic field .",
    "we offer a detailed discussion of this b field and its potential origin in @xcite .",
    "the ubvri wavelength dependence of _ intrinsic _ polarization of many candidate be stars in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr exhibit either polarization balmer jumps and/or electron scattering signatures , which is the expected diagnostic of free - free scattering from a gaseous disk .",
    "no evidence of a secondary polarigenic agent , i.e. dust scattering , is observed in these system .",
    "moreover , the 2mass near - ir colors of many of these systems are most consistent with the expected colors of pure gas disks , and inconsistent with the observed colors of dustier magellanic cloud disk systems ( herbig ae / be , b[e ] ) .",
    "we conclude these data confirm the initial suggestion of @xcite that classical be stars are present in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr , contradicting claims that the be phenomenon only develops in the second half of a b star s main sequence lifetime @xcite , i.e. after 10 myr .",
    "4 .   we interpret the observed presence of classical be stars in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr as evidence that a significant population of early - type b stars must emerge onto the zams rotating at near critical velocities .",
    "we note however that these results do not exclude the possibility that we are observing the hypothesized subset of classical be stars which rotate at sub - critical velocities @xcite .",
    "5 .   comparing the polarimetric properties of our dataset to a similar survey of galactic classical",
    "be stars , we find the prevalence of polarimetric balmer jump signatures decreases with metallicity .",
    "we speculate that these results might indicate that either it is more difficult to form large disk systems in low metallicity environments , or that the average disk temperature is higher in these low metallicity environments .",
    "we find evidence that at least 25% of photometrically identified candidate be stars do not exhibit polarimetric signatures consistent with those expected from classical be stars .",
    "these data strongly suggest that caution must be exercised when attempting to correlate the onset of the be phenomenon with evolutionary age and/or metallicity based solely on statistics derived from simple 2-color diagram photometry .",

    "<S> we parameterize the interstellar polarization ( isp ) along the lines of sight to these twelve clusters , thereby providing a diagnostic of the fundamental properties of the dust which characterizes their localized interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we determine that the isp associated with the smc cluster ngc 330 is characterized by a modified serkowski law with @xmath1 @xmath24500 , indicating the presence of smaller than average dust grains . </S>",

    "<S> our _ intrinsic _ polarization results , along with available near - ir color information , strongly supports the suggestion of wisniewski et al . </S>",

    "<S> our data imply that a significant number of b - type stars must emerge onto the zero - age - main - sequence rotating at near - critical rotation rates , although we can not rule out the possibility that these data instead reveal the presence of a sub - group of the be phenomenon characterized by sub - critically rotating objects .    comparing the polarimetric properties of our dataset to a similar survey of galactic classical be stars , we find that the prevalence of polarimetric balmer jump signatures decreases with metallicity . we speculate that these results might indicate that either it is more difficult to form large disk systems in low metallicity environments , or that the average disk temperature is higher in these low metallicity environments . </S>",
