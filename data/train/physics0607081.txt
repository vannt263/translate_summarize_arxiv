    "although , there are well established software packages in the area of quantum chemistry such as gaussian@xcite , molpro@xcite and gamess@xcite which allow to obtain approximate numerical solutions to a number of fair sized molecules , the simplest molecule namely the hydrogen molecular ion , a quantum mechanical three - body problem , still remains mathematically intractable .    in the fixed nuclei approximation",
    ", it is well known that the schrdinger wave equation - a second order partial differential equation ( pde ) - of the problem of one electron moving in the field of two fixed nuclei can be separated in prolate - spheroidal coordinates@xcite .",
    "these coordinates allow a separation of variables that results in two non - trivial ordinary differential equations ( ode ) , and hence two eigenparameters : the energy parameter @xmath3 , and a separation constant @xmath4 related to the total orbital angular momentum and the runge - lenz vector .",
    "we note that asymptotic expansions for small or large internuclear distances @xmath5 have been obtained .",
    "a very comprehensive presentation of the energy eigenvalues for the ground state and a number of exited states is shown in the work of ek _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "these could almost constitute analytical solutions but the resulting series are divergent though asymptotic@xcite and therefore useful only at large internuclear distances .",
    "another complication is that for the homonuclear case , every _ gerade _ energy @xmath6 ( wave function symmetric under exchange of nuclei ) has a counterpart _ ungerade _ solution ( wave function antisymmetric under exchange of nuclei ) whose energy @xmath7 has exactly the same @xmath8 expansion .",
    "this makes the calculation of exchange energy splittings @xmath9 very elusive to calculate at large @xmath5 , although there are specialized methods for recovering these splittings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "even recently , there has been examination of series in small @xmath5 limited to the ground state short - range interaction energy@xcite but we still have no further insight into the actual mathematical nature governing the energy eigenvalues .",
    "we also cite the work of demkov _",
    "et al._@xcite but their analytical solutions correspond to a peculiar charge ratio depending on the internuclear distance and therefore not physically useful .",
    "thus , complete analytical solutions of the eigenstates of h@xmath0 , in areas of molecular interest , such as the region near the equilibrium internuclear distance ( bond length ) of the ground state remain elusive .    a wide variety of _ numerical _ methods have been used to solve the h@xmath0 problem in this case .",
    "for example , bates , ledsham and stewart@xcite used recursion and continued fractions . hunter and pritchard@xcite used matrix methods and rayleigh quotient iteration .",
    "madsen and peek@xcite used power series and associated legendre expansions to set up two equations whose simultaneous solution then gave the two eigenparameters . an accurate way to obtain energies and wavefunctions for the one - electron two - center problem is provided by the program odkil conceived by aubert - frcon _",
    "et al._@xcite based on a method by killingbeck .",
    "as of the 1980s , it was possible to calculate the eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions of the discrete states of h@xmath0 with a rapid fortran program . yet",
    ", complete analytical solutions have so far remained elusive : the classical @xmath10-body problem can not be solved in closed form for @xmath11 and the quantum counterpart is even worse by virtue of being an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the approach used here is called `` experimental mathematics '' , an unorthodox approach involving multi - disciplinary activities by which to find new mathematical patterns and conjectures . the goal in this context is to search and find mathematical structures and patterns to be re - examined with more `` rigor '' at a later stage .",
    "the level of rigor is of course relative : in dealing with a difficult problem in applied mathematics , we can not approach the level of rigor demanded in number theory .",
    "nonetheless , we desire demonstrations sufficiently convincing to the molecular physicist .",
    "the present work will involve a combination of methods , results and procedures from different areas .",
    "we first start with results from what is called : _",
    "dimensional scaling_. it has been known for some time that the schrdinger wave equation can be generalized to an arbitrary number of dimensions @xmath12 which can be subsequently treated as continuous variable@xcite . in the limit as @xmath13 , the hydrogen molecular ion becomes the double well dirac delta function model which can be solved exactly@xcite in terms of the _ lambert w function_@xcite .",
    "dimensional scaling applied to h@xmath0 has been studied at length by hershbach s group@xcite , in particular , by frantz@xcite , loeser and lopez - cabrera@xcite .",
    "the latter work provides even more insight into the mathematical relationship between the real h@xmath0 at @xmath14 and its one - dimensional limit .",
    "next , armed with the information provided by dimensional scaling , we will return to the real three - dimensional formulation of aubert _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this formulation is re - examined using a computer algebra system ( cas ) within the approach of experimental mathematics : patterns and results are obtained . the cas used is maple because it is readily available to us but the results could also be implemented on other systems .",
    "the resulting series expansions are verified numerically and algebraically . in particular",
    ", we will demonstrate that our results are independent of choice of basis and basis size and consequently completely general",
    ". the end - result will be then analytically compared with the one - dimensional result and put on a near equal footing allowing us to find the mathematical category to which belong the eigenvalues of h@xmath0 . in view of the type of solution obtained ,",
    "a tentative `` physical '' picture is associated with the analytical solutions .",
    "a summary with concluding remarks is made at the end .",

    "gerade _ solution and the anti - symmetric or _ ungerade _ solution and @xmath29 is the lambert w function satisfying @xmath30@xcite . this function first introduced by johann heinrich lambert ( 1728 - 1777 ) , a contemporary of euler , has been `` invented '' and `` re - invented '' at various periods in history but its ubiquitous nature was not fully realized within the last decade or so .",
    "for example , the @xmath29 function appears in wien s displacement law of blackbody radiation . in general",
    ", it has appeared in electrostatics , statistical mechanics , general relativity , radiative transfer , quantum chromodynamics , combinatorial number theory , fuel consumption and population growth etc  ( see ref . @xcite and references herein ) .",
    "more recently , the lambert @xmath29 function has also appeared in `` linear '' gravity two - body problem@xcite as a solution to the einstein field equations with one spatial dimension and one time dimension @xmath31 .",
    "the present work also includes a generalization of the @xmath29 function .",
    "recent work@xcite shows that the @xmath29 function can be further generalized to express solutions to transcendental algebraic equations of the form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are polynomials in @xmath35 of respectively degrees @xmath10 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a constant .",
    "the standard @xmath29 function applies for cases when @xmath38 and @xmath39 and expresses solutions for the case of equal charges for eq .",

    "the case of _ unequal _ charges or unequal masses corresponds to cases of higher @xmath10 and @xmath36 values .",

    "some insight into the mathematical nature of the eigenenergies of h@xmath0 is revealed by the fact that the eigensolutions for the electronic energies at @xmath13 and @xmath42 actually bound the @xmath14 ground state eigenenergy of h@xmath0@xcite as shown in figure 1 .",
    "moreover , the latter can be estimated by a linear interpolation formula@xcite : @xmath43 this formula agrees with the numerically accurate eigenenergy ( as given by program odkil or the work of d. frantz ) to within about 2 or 3 digits for the range of r near the bond length .",
    "the result at @xmath44 involves the extrema of a hamiltonian expression ( * ? ? ?",

    "one has to consider a region of @xmath5 divided by @xmath45 . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the root is determined by the root of a quartic polynomial@xcite and the result for @xmath47 is determined by a sixth degree polynomial .",

    "the result at @xmath13 is in terms of an implicit special function , which is the lambert @xmath29 function . given how well this interpolation formulation works , this already suggests what is the mathematical nature of the eigenenergies of the true hydrogen molecular ion @xmath48 .",

    "the results express analytical solutions for the ground state and the countable infinity of discrete states of h@xmath16 for the homonuclear case when the magnetic quantum number @xmath78 . from the discussion below eq .",
    "( [ eq : d3 ] ) , we anticipate that the eigensolutions for @xmath79 for the homonuclear case to be qualitatively similar though admittedly this remains to be proven .",
    "we emphasize that although the basis and approach used here were ideal for @xmath78 and the homonuclear case .",
    "the computer algebra methods shown are directly applicated to the heteronuclear case with @xmath79 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "one should work directly from the recurrence relations of the chosen basis now that we understand how these basis coefficients behave with better and better accuracy for the series expansions of @xmath172 in @xmath67 and the asymptotic series expansions for @xmath109 in @xmath110 .",
    "however , we make no pronouncements concerning the nature or mathematical category of the solutions for the heteronuclear case or when the nuclei are allowed to move .",
    "we note that for @xmath78 , the matrix for @xmath90 remains tridiagonal while the band matrix for @xmath91 is pentadiagonal and consequently governed by nested recurrence relations@xcite suggesting that the analysis shown herein is possible .",
    "a number of issues arise from this result . in a sense ,",
    "the result is both overdue and premature .",
    "it is overdue because of our present capacity to find solutions to fair - sized molecules using computational chemistry . on the other hand , it is premature .",
    "the functions we found @xmath126 and @xmath109 do not seem to resemble anything we have seen in the literature .",
    "the apparent singularities or `` resonances '' at @xmath173 for @xmath126 and @xmath174 for @xmath141 for @xmath175 do not constitute a problem since the eigenparameters @xmath67 and @xmath4 for a given @xmath5 are never found on these resonances . once a value of @xmath5 is injected into @xmath176 , solving for @xmath67 numerically did not create any problems in the test cases examined so far . at any rate ,",
    "the tables shown herein merely illustrate the convergence properties of the functions @xmath126 and @xmath109 we have identified : solving the coupled set of polynomials @xmath91 and @xmath90 for @xmath67 and @xmath4 at a given distance @xmath5 involves no resonances and is still the most useful method from a computational point of view . in principle , the latter can go further than any fortran program .",
    "we have ordered series representations to relatively high order of both of these functions @xmath126 and @xmath109 and we can generate reliable numbers for a number of discrete quantum states . we have also demonstrated that we could use these series beyond their radius of convergence using techniques for handling divergent series .    from here , one could explore and seek alternate representations of these functions with better convergence properties especially at low @xmath5 for @xmath109 and large @xmath5 for @xmath126 but the results from the sidi transformations are already very promising . at any rate",
    ", the hydrogen molecular ion for clamped nuclei can be entirely contained within simple computer algebra sessions , not much more complicated than those of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the exploratory and roundabout way by which we found our solutions , suggests there is something missing in the mathematical physics or the methods for obtaining the eigenvalues of the schrdinger wave equation .",
    "there is hardly any existing `` technology '' for solving quantum chemistry problems involving implicit functions .",
    "our use of a basis is certainly valid to demonstrate or prove a result .",
    "furthermore , the convergence of the bases used here has been confirmed by determining the asymptotic behavior of the expansion coefficients of the wavefunctions for the various basis sets considered@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a more direct way of generating the functions of @xmath126 and @xmath109 would be instructive .",
