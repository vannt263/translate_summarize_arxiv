    "our present understanding of the universe is based upon the successful hot big bang theory , which explains its evolution from the first fraction of a second to our present age , around 13 billion years later .",
    "this theory rests upon four strong pillars , a theoretical framework based on general relativity , as put forward by albert einstein and alexander a. friedmann in the 1920s , and three strong observational facts .",
    "first , the expansion of the universe , discovered by edwin p. hubble in the 1930s , as a recession of galaxies at a speed proportional to their distance to us .",
    "second , the relative abundance of light elements , explained by george gamow in the 1940s , mainly that of helium , deuterium and lithium [ see fig .  1 ] , which were cooked from the nuclear reactions that took place at around a second to a few minutes after the big bang , when the universe was a hundred times hotter than the core of the sun .",
    "third , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the afterglow of the big bang , discovered in 1965 by arno a. penzias and robert w. wilson as a very isotropic blackbody radiation at a temperature of about 3 degrees kelvin ( degrees centigrade above absolute zero ) , emitted when the universe was cold enough to form neutral atoms , and photons decoupled from matter , approximately 300000 years after the big bang .",
    "today , these observations are confirmed to within a few percent accuracy , and have helped establish the hot big bang as the preferred model of the universe .",
    "the big bang theory could not explain , however , the origin of matter and structure in the universe ; that is , the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry , without which the universe today would be filled by a uniform radiation continuosly expanding and cooling , with no traces of matter , and thus without the possibility to form gravitationally bound systems like galaxies , stars and planets that could sustain life .",
    "moreover , the standard big bang theory assumes but can not explain the origin of the extraordinary smoothness and flatness of the universe on the very large scales , seen by the microwave background probes and the largest galaxy catalogs [ see fig .  2 ] .",
    "it can not explain the origin of the primordial density perturbations that gave rise to cosmic structures like galaxies , clusters and superclusters , via gravitational collapse ; neither the quantity and nature of the dark matter that we believe holds the universe together ; nor the origin of the big bang itself .    in the 1980s a new paradigm , deeply rooted in fundamental physics ,",
    "was put forward by alan h. guth , andrei d. linde and others , to address these fundamental questions . according to the inflationary paradigm ,",
    "the early universe went through a period of exponential expansion , driven by the approximately constant energy density of a scalar field called the inflaton .",
    "in modern physics , elementary particles are represented by quantum fields , which resemble the familiar electric , magnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "a field is simply a function of space and time whose quantum oscillations are interpreted as particles .",
    "for instance , the photon is the particle associated with the electromagnetic field . in our case , the inflaton field has associated with it a large potential energy density , which drives the exponential expansion during inflation [ see fig .  3 ] .",
    "we know from general relativity that the density of matter determines the expansion of the universe , but a constant energy density acts in a very peculiar way : as a repulsive force that makes any two points in space separate at exponentially large speeds .",
    "( this does not violate the laws of causality because there is no information carried along in the expansion , it is simply the stretching of spacetime . )",
    "this superluminal expansion is capable of explaining the large scale homogeneity of our observable universe and , in particular , why the microwave background looks so isotropic : regions separated today by more than a degree in the sky were , in fact , in causal contact before inflation , but were stretched to cosmological distances by the expansion [ see fig .",
    "any inhomogeneities present before the tremendous expansion would be washed out . moreover , in the usual big bang scenario a flat universe , one in which the gravitational attraction of matter is exactly balanced by the cosmic expansion , is unstable under perturbations : a small deviation from flatness is amplified and soon produces either an empty universe or a collapsed one . for the universe to be nearly flat today , it must have been extremely flat at nucleosynthesis for example , deviations not exceeding more than one part in @xmath0 .",
    "this extreme fine tuning of initial conditions was also solved by the inflationary paradigm [ see fig .  5 ]",
    ". thus inflation is an extremely elegant hypothesis that explains how a region much , much greater that our own observable universe could have become smooth and flat without recourse to _ ad hoc _ initial conditions .",
    "if cosmological inflation made the universe so extremely flat and homogeneous , where did the galaxies and clusters of galaxies come from ?",
    "one of the most astonishing predictions of inflation , one that was not even expected , is that quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field are stretched by the exponential expansion and generate large scale perturbations in the metric .",
    "inflaton fluctuations are small wave - packets of energy that , according to general relativity , modify the spacetime fabric , creating a whole spectrum of curvature perturbations .",
    "the use of the word spectrum here is closely related to the case of light waves propagating in a medium : a spectrum characterises the amplitude of each given wavelength . in the case of inflation ,",
    "the inflaton fluctuations induce waves in the spacetime metric that can be decomposed into different wavelengths , all with approximately the same amplitude , that is , corresponding to a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "these patterns of perturbations in the metric are like fingerprints that characterise unequivocally a period of inflation .",
    "when matter fell in the troughs of these waves , it created density perturbations that collapsed gravitationally to form galaxies , clusters and superclusters of galaxies , with a spectrum that is also scale - invariant .",
    "such a type of spectrum was proposed in the early 1970s ( before inflation ) by edward r. harrison , and independently by the russian cosmologist yakov b. zeldovich , to explain the distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies on very large scales in our observable universe .    various telescopes , like the hubble space telescope",
    ", the twin keck telescopes in hawaii and the european southern observatory telescopes in chile , are exploring the most distant regions of the universe and discovering the first galaxies at large distances . according to the big bang theory ,",
    "the further the galaxy is , the larger its recession velocity , and the larger the shift towards the red of the spectrum of light from that galaxy .",
    "astronomers thus measure distances in units of red - shift @xmath1 .",
    "the furthest galaxies observed so far are at redshifts of @xmath2 , or 12 billion light - years from the earth , whose light was emitted when the universe had only about 5 percent of its present age .",
    "only a few galaxies are known at those redshifts , but there are at present various catalogs like the cfa and apm galaxy catalogs , and more recently the iras pscz [ see fig .  2 ] and las campanas redshift surveys , that study the spatial distribution of hundreds of thousands of galaxies up to distances of a billion light - years , or @xmath3 , that receed from us at speeds of tens of thousands of kilometres per second .",
    "these catalogs are telling us about the evolution of clusters of galaxies in the universe , and already put constraints on the theory of structure formation based on the gravitational collapse of the small inhomogeneities produced during inflation . from these observations one can infer that most galaxies formed at redshifts of order 2 to 4 ; clusters of galaxies formed at redshifts of order one , and superclusters are forming now .",
    "that is , cosmic structure formed from the bottom up , from galaxies to clusters to superclusters , and not the other way around .",
    "this fundamental difference is an indication of the type of matter that gave rise to structure .",
    "we know from primordial nucleosynthesis that all the baryons in the universe can not account for the observed amount of matter , so there must be some extra matter ( dark since we do nt see it ) to account for its gravitational pull . whether it is relativistic ( hot ) or non - relativistic ( cold ) could be inferred from observations : relativistic particles tend to diffuse from one concentration of matter to another , thus transferring energy among them and preventing the growth of structure on small scales .",
    "this is excluded by observations , so we conclude that most of the matter responsible for structure formation must be cold . how much there is is a matter of debate at the moment .",
    "some recent analyses suggest that there is not enough cold dark matter to reach the critical density required to make the universe flat .",
    "some other form of energy permeates the universe , if we want to make sense of the present observations . in order to resolve this issue ,",
    "even deeper galaxy redshift catalogs are underway , looking at millions of galaxies , like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the anglo - australian two degree field ( 2df ) galaxy redshift survey , which are at this moment taking data , up to redshifts of @xmath4 , or several billion light - years away , over a large region of the sky .",
    "these important observations will help astronomers determine the nature of the dark matter and test the validity of the models of structure formation .",
    "[ table1 ]    .the parameters of the standard cosmological model [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     everything we know about the properties of elementary particles is included in the standard model of particle physics . it describes more than a hundred observed particles and their interactions in terms of a few fundamental constituents : six quarks and six leptons , and their antiparticles [ see table  2 ] .",
    "the standard model describes three types of interactions : the electromagnetic force , the strong and the weak nuclear forces .",
    "these forces are transmitted by the corresponding particles : the photon , the gluon and the w and z bosons .",
    "the theory also requires a scalar particle , the higgs particle , responsible for the masses of quarks and leptons and the breaking of the electroweak symmetry at an energy scale 100 times the mass of the proton .",
    "the higgs is believed to lie behind most of the mysteries of the standard model , including the asymmetry between matter and antimatter .",
    "symmetries are fundamental properties of any physical theory .",
    "a theory is symmetric under certain symmetry operation , like reflection , if its laws apply equally well after such an operation is performed on part of the physical system .",
    "an important example is the operation called parity reversal , denoted by p. it produces a mirror reflection of an object and rotates it 180 degrees about an axis perpendicular to the mirror .",
    "a theory has p symmetry if the laws of physics are the same in the real and the parity - reversed world .",
    "particles such as leptons and quarks can be classified as right- or left - handed depending on the sense of their internal rotation , or spin , around their direction of motion .",
    "if p symmetry holds , right - handed particles behave exactly like left - handed ones",
    ". the laws of electrodynamics and the strong interactions are the same in a parity - reflected universe .",
    "but , as chien - shiung wu discovered in 1957 , the weak interaction acts very differently on particles with different handedness : only left - handed particles can decay by means of the weak interaction , not right - handed ones . moreover ,",
    "as far as we know , there are no right - handed neutrinos , only left - handed .",
    "so the weak force violates p.    another basic symmetry of nature is charge conjugation , denoted by c. this operation changes the quantum numbers of every particle into those of its antiparticle .",
    "charge symmetry is also violated by the weak interactions : antineutrinos are not left - handed , only right - handed . combining c and p one",
    "gets the charge - parity symmetry cp , which turns all particles into their antiparticles and also reverses their handedness : left - handed neutrinos become right - handed antineutrinos [ see fig .  9 ] .",
    "although charge and parity symmetry are individually broken by the weak interaction , one expects their combination to be conserved .",
    "however , in 1964 , a groundbreaking experiment by james cronin , val finch and ren turlay at brookhaven national laboratory showed that cp was in fact violated to one part in 1000 .",
    "it was hard to see why cp symmetry should be broken at all and even more difficult to understand why the breaking was so small .",
    "soon after , in 1972 , makoto kobayashi and toshihide maskawa showed that cp could be violated within the standard model if three or more generations of quarks existed , because of cp nonconserving phases that could not be rotated away .",
    "only two generations where known at the time , but in 1975 martin l. perl and collaborators discovered the tau lepton at the stanford linear accelerator centre ( slac ) , the first ingredient of the third generation .",
    "only recently the last quark in the family was discovered at fermilab , the top quark .",
    "but how does this picture fit in the evolution of the universe ? in 1967 , the russian physicist andrei sakharov pointed out the three necessary conditions for the baryon asymmetry of the universe to develop .",
    "first , we need interactions that do not conserve baryon number b , otherwise no asymmetry could be produced in the first place .",
    "second , c and cp symmetry must be violated , in order to differentiate between matter and antimatter , otherwise b nonconserving interactions would produce baryons and antibaryons at the same rate , thus maintaining zero net baryon number .",
    "third , these processes should occur out of thermal equilibrium , otherwise particles and antiparticles , which have the same mass , would have equal occupation numbers and would be produced at the same rate .",
    "the standard model is baryon symmetric at the classical level , but violates b at the quantum level , through the chiral anomaly .",
    "electroweak interactions violate c and cp , but the magnitude of the latter is clearly insufficient to account for the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "this failure suggests that there must be other sources of cp violation in nature , and thus the standard model of particle physics is probably incomplete .",
    "one of the most popular extensions of the standard model includes a new symmetry called supersymmetry , which relates bosons ( particles that mediate interactions ) with fermions ( the constituents of matter ) .",
    "those extensions generically predict other sources of cp violation coming from new interactions at scales above 1000 times the mass of the proton .",
    "such scales will soon be explored in the first years of the next millenium by particle colliders like the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , the european centre for particle physics , and by the tevatron at fermilab .",
    "the mechanism for baryon production in the early universe in these models relies on the strength of the electroweak phase transition , as the universe cooled and the symmetry was broken . only for strongly first order phase transitions",
    "is the universe sufficiently far from equilibrium to produce enough baryon asymmetry .",
    "unfortunately , the phase transition in these models is invariably too weak to account for the observed asymmetry , so some other mechanism is needed .    if reheating after inflation occurred in an explosive way , via the resonant production of particles from the inflaton decay , as recent developments suggest , then the universe has actually gone through a very non - linear , non - perturbative and very far from equilibrium stage , before thermalising via particle interactions .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis could then take place during that epoch , soon after the end of low energy inflation at the electroweak scale .",
    "such models can be constructed but require a specially flat direction ( a very small mass for the inflaton ) during inflation , in order to satisfy the constraints from the amplitude of temperature anisotropies seen by cobe .",
    "such flat directions are generic in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . after inflation ,",
    "the inflaton acquires a large mass from its interaction with the higgs field .",
    "the crucial ingredient of departure from equilibrium , necessary for the excess production of baryons over antibaryons , is strongly present in this new scenario of baryogenesis , as the universe develops from a zero temperature and zero entropy state , at the end of inflation , to a thermal state with exponentially large numbers of particles , the origin of the standard hot big bang .",
    "if , during this stage , fundamental or effective interactions that are b , c and cp violating were fast enough compared to the rate of expansion , the universe could have ended with the observed baryon asymmetry of one part in @xmath5 , or one baryon per @xmath6 photons today , as deduced from observations of the light element abundances [ see fig .  1 ] .",
    "recent calculations suggest than indeed , the required asymmetry could be produced as long as some new physics , just above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , induces a new effective cp violating interaction .",
    "these new phenomena necessarily involve an interaction between the higgs particle , responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , and the inflaton field , responsible for the period of cosmological inflation .",
    "therefore , for this scenario to work , it is expected that both the higgs and the inflaton particles be discovered at the future particle physics colliders like the lhc and the next linear collider ( nlc ) , to be built in the next millenium .",
    "furthermore , this new physics would necessarily involve new interactions in the quark sector , for example inducing cp violations in the b meson ( a bound state composed of a bottom quark and an antidown quark ) system .",
    "such violations are the main research objective of the b factory at slac in california and at kek , the high energy accelerator research organisation in tsukuba , japan .",
    "those experiments will be taking data in a few months time , at the turn of the millenium , and could give us clues on the issues of the matter - antimatter asymmetry and thus on baryogenesis from reheating after inflation .",
    "if confirmed , such a new scenario of baryogenesis would represent a leap forward in our understanding of the universe from the unifying paradigm of inflationary cosmology .",
    "furthermore , it would bring inflation down to a scale where present or future particle physics experiments would be able to explore it quite thoroughly .",
    "cosmological inflation thus enters the realm of testable low energy particle physics .",
    "we have entered a new era in cosmology , were a host of high precision measurements are already posing challenges to our understanding of the universe : the density of ordinary matter and the total amount of energy in the universe ; the microwave background anisotropies on a fine scale resolution ; primordial deuterium abundance from quasar absorption lines ; the acceleration parameter of the universe from high - redshift supernovae observations ; the rate of expansion from gravitational lensing ; large scale structure measurements of the distribution of galaxies and their evolution , and many more , which already put constraints on the parameter space of cosmological models [ see fig .  10 ] .",
    "however , these are only the forerunners of the precision era in cosmology that will dominate the new millenium , and will make cosmology a phenomenological science .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that all physical theories are approximations of reality that can fail if pushed too far .",
    "physical science advances by incorporating earlier theories that are experimentally supported into larger , more encompassing frameworks .",
    "the standard big bang theory is supported by a wealth of evidence , nobody really doubts its validity anymore .",
    "however , in the last decade it has been incorporated into the larger picture of cosmological inflation , which has become the new standard cosmological model .",
    "all cosmological issues are now formulated in the context of the inflationary cosmology .",
    "it is the best explanation we have at the moment for the increasing set of cosmological observations .    in the next few years",
    "we will have an even larger set of high - quality observations that will test inflation and the cold dark matter paradigm of structure formation , and determine most of the 12 or more parameters of the standard cosmological model to a few percent accuracy [ see table .  1 ] .",
    "it may seem that with such a large number of parameters one can fit almost anything .",
    "however , that is not the case when there is enough quantity and quality of data .",
    "an illustrative example is the standard model of particle physics , with around 21 parameters and a host of precise measurements from particle accelerators all over the world .",
    "this model is nowadays rigurously tested , and its parameters measured to a precision of better than a percent in some cases .",
    "it is clear that high precision measurements will make the standard model of cosmology as robust as that of particle physics .",
    "in fact , it has been the technological advances of particle physics detectors that are mainly responsible for the burst of new data coming from cosmological observations .",
    "this is definitely a very healthy field , but there is still a lot to do . with the advent of better and larger precision experiments , cosmology is becoming a mature science , where speculation has given way to phenomenology .",
    "there are still many unanswered fundamental questions in this emerging picture of cosmology .",
    "for instance , we still do not know the nature of the inflaton field , is it some new fundamental scalar field in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , or is it just some effective description of a more fundamental high energy interaction ?",
    "hopefully , in the near future , experiments in particle physics might give us a clue to its nature .",
    "inflation had its original inspiration in the higgs field , the scalar field supposed to be responsible for the masses of elementary particles ( quarks and leptons ) and the breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "such a field has not been found yet , and its discovery at the future particle colliders would help understand one of the truly fundamental problems in physics , the origin of masses . if the experiments discover something completely new and unexpected , it would automatically affect inflation at a fundamental level .",
    "one of the most difficult challenges that the new cosmology will have to face is understanding the origin of the cosmological constant , if indeed it is confirmed by independent sets of observations . ever since einstein introduced it as a way to counteract gravitational attraction , it has haunted cosmologists and particle physicists for decades .",
    "we still do not have a mechanism to explain its extraordinarily small value , 120 orders of magnitude below what is predicted by quantum physics . for several decades",
    "there has been the reasonable speculation that this fundamental problem may be related to the quantisation of gravity .",
    "general relativity is a classical theory of spacetime , and it has proved particularly difficult to construct a consistent quantum theory of gravity , since it involves fundamental issues like causality and the nature of spacetime itself .    the value of the cosmological constant predicted by quantum physics is related to our lack of understanding of gravity at the microscopic level .",
    "however , its effect is dominant at the very largest scales of clusters or superclusters of galaxies , on truly macroscopic scales .",
    "this hints at what is known in quantum theory as an anomaly , a quantum phenomenon relating both ultraviolet ( microscopic ) and infrared ( macroscopic ) divergences .",
    "we can speculate that perhaps general relativity is not the correct description of gravity on the very largest scales .",
    "in fact , it has been only in the last few billion years that the observable universe has become large enough that these global effects could be noticeable . in its infancy , the universe was much smaller than it is now , and presumably general relativity gave a correct description of its evolution , as confirmed by the successes of the standard big bang theory . as it expanded , larger and larger regions were encompassed and therefore deviations from general relativity would slowly become important .",
    "it may well be that the recent determination of a cosmological constant from observations of supernovae at high redshifts is hinting at a fundamental misunderstanding of gravity on the very large scales .",
    "if this were indeed the case , we should expect that the new generation of precise cosmological observations will not only affect our cosmological model of the universe but also a more fundamental description of nature ."
