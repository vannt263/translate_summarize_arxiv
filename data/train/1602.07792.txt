    "the estimated higher speed is around 337 @xmath6 during 08:02 ut to 08:22 ut ( figures  [ fig14](a ) ) .",
    "the speed increase is due to the reconnection between the erupting filament f1 with the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the reconnection between the erupting filament f1 with the ambient field started at around 08:02 ut and continued up to around 08:15 ut , which is consistent with the fast rising phase of filament f1 .",

    "the present work deals with the observational analyses and interpretations of sympathetic eruptions , associated flares and cmes using multiwavelength data from _ sdo_/aia , _ goes _ , nso / gong , _ stereo - a_/euvi , _ stereo - a_/cor1 , _ rhessi _ and _ soho_/lasco occurring in two active regions on 2013 november 17 .",
    "we discuss various interactions and reconnections between filament magnetic field systems and between the filament magnetic field and the surrounding ambient magnetic field during the eruptions .",
    "the main results of the study are as follows :    1 .   observations clearly show that the two successive eruptions and associated flares can be interpreted as the sympathetic events . 2 .",
    "the magnetic reconnection can be divided into four stages during these sympathetic events .",
    "the first stage reconnection occurred as a flux cancellation between the legs of sheared arcades of filament f2 .",
    "this might trigger a two ribbon solar flare , the eruption of the overlying coronal arcades and coronal loops .",
    "the second stage reconnection could be between the field lines of the expanding flux rope f2 and the flux rope f1 as well as with its arcades .",
    "it activates f1 with heating signatures all along the flux rope and destabilizes it .",
    "the third stage reconnection occurred at the wake of the erupting filament f1 between the legs of overlaying arcades .",
    "this may trigger another two ribbon solar flare .",
    "the fourth stage of reconnection occurred between the erupting arcades of the filament f1 with the nearby surrounding ambient field .",
    "we believe that the acceleration phase and the asymmetric eruption of filament f1 are the consequences of this coronal reconnection .",
    "the present observed eruptions and flares can be interpret as two consecutive sympathetic eruptions and flares .",
    "for the sympathetic eruptions , it requires that they should occur in two different active regions and different pils on the sun with some physical connections @xcite . in our case , we observed two eruptions , from two different nearby active regions as well as different pils ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the nlfff extrapolation shows the presence of overlying field lines of f1 and f2 anchored in the small positive region between them , showing some possible connection between them ( see box 2 in figures  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig16 ] and  [ fig17 ] ) .",
    "the similar directions of both eruptions within a short time period of @xmath540 minutes provides another evidence for sympathetic eruptions .",
    "we also observed two flares associated with these sympathetic eruptions , which can also be considered as the sympathetic flares .",
    "two different set of flare loops have been observed close to each other with common anchoring at the central positive polarity region ( figure  [ fig11](e ) ) .",
    "hence , the present observations not only show the sympathetic eruptions but also the sympathetic flares produced by them .",
    "similar types of sympathetic flares associated with two eruptions have also been reported in a few earlier works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the multi - wavelength observations , we identify the four different stages of reconnections during the sympathetic eruptions ( see schematic in figure  [ fig17 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig17](a ) represents the initial magnetic topology of the filaments and overlying ambient coronal fields .",
    "two nearby filaments ( i.e. , f1 and f2 ) exist along with their overlying arcades as well as surrounding ambient fields ( see figure  [ fig2 ] also ) .",
    "the first flare reconnection seems to be consistent with the low  lying tether  cutting type reconnection between the sheared arcades leading to the formation of a flux rope ( c.f .",
    "the formation of the flare loops and their separation with time can be understood as resulting from reconnection between the legs of the surrounding field as the flux rope of that first eruption moves outward to form cme1 .",
    "the growing flare loops and the spreading flare ribbons are the observational signatures of this first reconnection ( see animations accompanying figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "our observations show that the first eruption , which led to this first reconnection , began from near filament f2 , but there is no clear ejection of f2 .",
    "apparently , f2 was located below the field that erupted in that first eruption .",
    "similar kind of eruptions has been discussed in observational studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some of them have been interpreted with the partial eruption model of flux rope @xcite .",
    "the second stage of reconnection is the most difficult one to explain and it is not obvious where it happened .",
    "what we are sure is that there is an interaction between both systems ( figure  [ fig17](d ) ) and the flux rope of f2 destabilizes the f1 system .",
    "various observational signatures of second interaction and reconnection have been discussed in section  [ sect34 ] .",
    "it has been observed that the removal of overlying field lines during the first eruption plays a crucial role to trigger a nearby eruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some studies proposed that the external breakout type magnetic reconnection during the first eruption either in quadrupolar magnetic configuration @xcite or in unipolar helmet streamer @xcite magnetic configuration may be responsible for the other nearby successive eruption by removing the overlying flux . on the other hand the sucking of the field lines over f1 by",
    "the first reconnection is also a factor of diminishing the tension ( green field lines over f2 in figure  [ fig17](c ) ) .",
    "there was probably a driving reconnection pushing the two systems together .",
    "this kind of reconnection is only possible in 3d as shown mhd simulations for other event sequences @xcite .",
    "the third stage of reconnection is believed to occur during the eruption of filament f1 and has some similarity with the first stage of reconnection occurring in the f2 system ( figures  [ fig11](b)(d ) and  [ fig17](e ) and section  [ sect35 ] ) .",
    "this reconnection may be consistent with the standard cshkp flare model by filament or flux rope eruption ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to this , during the eruption of filament or flux rope the reconnection between the legs of surrounding arcades in the wake may trigger a solar flare .",
    "the erupting arcades of filament f1 also reconnected with the near - by ambient magnetic flux ( figure  [ fig17](f ) ) and formed another new loop system ( figure  [ fig17](f ) ) .",
    "we interpret this reconnection as the fourth stage of reconnection ( refer to section  [ sect36 ] for detail ) .",
    "this reconnection can be interpreted between the ambient open field lines with the filament f1 growing arcades in the corona .",
    "similar kind of coronal reconnection senario has been discussed by @xcite to interpret the filament eruption on 2000 september 12 . recently , for the first time @xcite found the evidence of reconnection in the corona between the field lines of two different active regions during cmes .",
    "they also identified the bright coronal region of reconnection as well as the cool down flowing plasma . in our case",
    ", we also find observational signature of coronal reconnection via bi  directional flow of filament f1 plasma after their arcade reconnection with the ambient magnetic field ( figure  [ fig12 ] and associated animations ) .",
    "we also believe that this reconnection was responsible for the acceleration phase of the eruptive part of filament f1 ( section  [ sect37 ] and figure  [ fig14](a ) ) .",
    "this result suggests that this kind of coronal magnetic field reconnection may play an important role in accelerating the filament speed during its eruption .",
    "this reconnection is also believed for the asymmetric eruption of filament f1 .",
    "we observed that the northern leg of filament f1 erupted fully , while the southern leg remained anchoring on the sun ( figure  [ fig13 ] ) .",
    "we believe that the interaction and reconnection of the erupting southern part of filament f1 with the ambient magnetic field caused the eruption asymmetry .",
    "this is a different mechanism compared with the whipping and zipping type model of asymmetric filament eruption given by @xcite . in the end ,",
    "three different types of loop system are formed , i.e. , two post flare loops and one newly formed loop system ( figures  [ fig11](e ) ,  [ fig12](c ) and  [ fig17](g ) ) .",
    "another interesting result is that filament f1 broke into two different parts , i.e. , the erupting upper and stable lower parts ( figures  [ fig4](h ) ,  [ fig5](h ) and  [ fig12](a ) ) .",
    "we suggest that the reconnection of the erupting filament f1 with the surviving field of f2 may break f1 into two parts .",
    "also , the observed enhancement in the brightness of the southern ribbon of the first flare during the eruption of filament f1 also provides some hint for this type of interaction ( figure  [ fig11](d ) ) .",
    "we also observe that the second fast eruption ( speed @xmath5377 @xmath6 ) overtook the first slow eruption ( 160 @xmath6 ) and the associated cmes merged and formed a compound cme ( see section  [ sect37 ] and figure  [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "the compound cme structure can be seen at 08:48 ut and onward with multiple leading edges and cavities ( figures  [ fig15](f)(h ) ) .",
    "these observations suggest that the sympathetic nearby eruptions and associated cmes in the same directions can also lead to the interesting cme  cme interaction events in the corona near the sun .",
    "these interactions have great importance for the production of solar energetic particle events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "study of nearby eruptions , flares and cmes tells important information about magnetic interactions and reconnections between them .",
    "we have identified several physical mechanisms for producing this sequence of sympathetic events in two different active regions : canceling flux , shear arcades , inflation or expansion of magnetic field systems . in this study , all these mechanisms work together or successively between the different magnetic systems .",
    "it provides a good example of sympathetic events .",
    "these kind of observational studies also provide important inputs for mhd modelings of sympathetic eruptions and the associated flares .",
