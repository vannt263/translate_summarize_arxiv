    "entanglement is one of the most fundamental features of quantum physics and is considered as the key resource for quantum information processing @xcite . in order to detect entanglement highly efficient witness operators",
    "are widely used nowadays @xcite . however , these operators give conclusive answers only for states close to the target state . to detect entanglement of arbitrary states , positive , but not completely positive maps @xcite , are the most universal entanglement identifiers .",
    "however , they are laborious to use as they require full state tomography . therefore , more efficient schemes to detect entanglement are most wanted .",
    "it has been recently shown that the presence of entanglement in a quantum state is fully characterized by suitable combinations of experimentally accessible correlations and expectation values of local measurements @xcite .",
    "this enables a simple and practical method to reveal entanglement of all pure states and some mixed states by measuring only few correlations @xcite .",
    "since the method is adaptive it does not require a priori knowledge of the state nor a shared reference frame between the possibly remote observers and thus greatly simplifies the practical application .    here",
    "we extend these results and analyze in detail the possible performance of two schemes for entanglement detection .",
    "the first one can be seen as an experimental implementation of schmidt decomposition , which identifies the maximal correlations through local measurements only .",
    "the second scheme shows how to deduce a strategy ( decision tree ) to find the maximal correlations of an unknown state and obtain a rapid violation of the threshold identifying entanglement even for an arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "the physical principle behind both of our schemes is correlation complementarity  @xcite .",
    "it makes use of trade - offs between correlations present in quantum states .",
    "once a measured correlation is big other related correlations have to be small and it is advantageous to move to measurements of the remaining correlations .",
    "this simplifies the entanglement detection scheme as a lower number of correlation measurements is required .",
    "a quantum state is entangled if the sum of squared measured correlations exceeds a certain bound @xcite .",
    "this identifier thus neither requires the measurement of all correlations in a quantum state nor the reconstruction of the density matrix .",
    "rather , it is now the goal to find strategies that minimize the number of correlation measurements .",
    "we show how this can be done in different ways described in the subsequent sections .",
    "the first method is to identify a schmidt decomposition from local results and filtering when necessary , the second is a particularly designed decision tree based on correlation complementarity .",
    "any @xmath0 qubit density matrix can be expressed as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the respective local pauli operator of the @xmath3th party ( @xmath4 being the identity matrix ) and the real coefficients @xmath5 $ ] are the components of the correlation tensor @xmath6 .",
    "they are given by the expectation values of the products of local pauli observables , @xmath7 $ ] , and can be determined by local measurements performed on each qubit .",
    "for @xmath0 qubit states , pure or mixed , the following sufficient condition for entanglement holds  @xcite : @xmath8 note , to prove that a state is entangled , it is sufficient to break the threshold , i.e. , in general it is not necessary to measure all correlations . using fundamental properties of the correlation tensor , we design schemes to minimize the number of required correlation measurements .",
    "any pure state of two qubits admits a schmidt decomposition @xcite @xmath9 . \\label{schmidt}\\ ] ] where the local bases @xmath10 and @xmath11 are called the schmidt bases of alice and bob .",
    "this is an elementary description of bipartite pure quantum states , where the existence of a second term in the decomposition directly indicates entanglement .",
    "in addition , in the schmidt bases , the correlation tensor of a two - qubit state takes a particularly simple form and shows maximal correlations in the state .",
    "therefore , finding the schmidt bases can be regarded as a redefinition of the measuring operators relative to the state and thus leads to rapid entanglement detection , in at most three subsequent measurements of correlations .",
    "once the bases are known , alice constructs her local measurements @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and so does bob .",
    "they can now detect entanglement by using the simple criterion ( [ simple_crit ] ) with only two correlation measurements because @xmath14 for all pure entangled states .",
    "note that since the bases of alice and bob are determined on the fly the laboratories are not required to share a common reference frame .    in the next sections we present how to find the schmidt bases ( up to a global phase ) from the experimental results gathered on individual qubits .",
    "we split the discussion into two cases , of non - vanishing and vanishing bloch vectors , i.e. local averages @xmath15 , describing the states of the individual qubits .    this systematic procedure to verify entanglement in a pure two - qubit state",

    "the schmidt bases of alice and bob are related to the standard bases as follows : @xmath16 the global phase of @xmath17 is relevant and required for the characterization of an arbitrary pure state , as can be seen from parameter counting .",
    "an arbitrary pure two - qubit state is parametrized by six real numbers ( four complex amplitudes minus normalization condition and an irrelevant global phase ) . plugging eqs .",
    "( [ schmidtbobp ] ) into the schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidt ] ) we indeed find the relevant six real parameters .    any two - qubit state written in the standard bases of alice and bob can be brought into the schmidt basis of alice by the transformation @xmath18 the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 of this transformation can be read from a non - vanishing normalized bloch vector : @xmath21 finally , the coefficients of the schmidt basis in the standard basis are functions of components of vector @xmath22 built out of experimentally accessible , local expectation values of pauli measurements : @xmath23 if @xmath24 , the standard basis is the schmidt basis .",
    "note that instead of transforming the state we can as well transform the measurement operators @xmath25 .",
    "the new operators are given by : @xmath26 and the schmidt basis is the @xmath27 basis , i.e. @xmath12",
    ".    the equivalent analysis has to be done for the schmidt basis of bob . in summary ,",
    "the schmidt bases are defined by the direction of the bloch vectors of reduced states , up to a global phase .",
    "the global phase of @xmath17 shows up as a relative phase in the schmidt decomposition .",
    "as it is not obtainable by local measurements it influences entanglement detection using operators ( [ new_directions ] ) .",
    "let us denote the basis established by local measurements of bob by @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 . using the locally determined bases the schmidt decomposition takes the form @xmath31 the correlations that alice and bob observe in the measurements related to locally determined bases are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "note that the correlation @xmath37 would vanish for @xmath38 and the two measurements @xmath39 and @xmath37 are not sufficient any more ( they were sufficient if the full knowledge about the schmidt bases had been available ) . in such a case , however , the other two correlations , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are non - zero , and can be used to reveal entanglement .",
    "if the first two measurements are not sufficient to overcome the entanglement threshold of  ( [ simple_crit ] ) , the third measurement of @xmath40 correlations will definitely allow exceeding the threshold for every pure entangled state .",
    "if the two - qubit state is maximally entangled , i.e. in the schmidt decomposition @xmath42 , the bloch vector is of zero length , @xmath43 , and the whole system admits infinitely many schmidt decompositions . for every unitary operation of alice , @xmath44 , there exists an operation of bob , @xmath45 , such that the state is unchanged : @xmath46 therefore , any basis of , say , alice can serve as the schmidt basis as soon as we accordingly update the basis of bob . our strategy to reveal",
    "the corresponding basis of bob is to filter in the chosen schmidt basis of alice .",
    "it is best to explain it on an example .",
    "assume alice chooses the standard basis as her schmidt basis .",
    "due to the mentioned invariance of the maximally entangled state there exists a schmidt basis of bob such that @xmath47 the basis of bob can be found by filtering of alice @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "we implemented this operation experimentally and provide the details later .",
    "in short , we use devices which are transparent to the @xmath50 state , but probabilistically `` reflect '' the @xmath51 state .",
    "if we imagine a perfect detector is observing a port of this device where the reflected particle travels , and we see no detection , the filter operation is performed on the initial state .",
    "if alice applies the filtering on her qubit and informs bob that the filtering was successful the initial state becomes @xmath52 the result of filtering is that for bob a bloch vector emerges and we can again use the method described above to find his schmidt basis .",
    "summing up all required steps we see that to experimentally verify entanglement of any pure two - qubit state without any further a priori knowledge requires at least @xmath53 local measurements to determine the schmidt bases and sometimes filtering requiring 3 local measurements more .",
    "finally two more ( or three if @xmath54 ) correlation measurements allow to verify the entanglement criterion .     and proceed with the correlation along the solid ( dotted ) arrow if the measured correlation is higher ( lower ) than the chosen threshold value ; here of @xmath55 .",
    "due to correlation complementarity there is a good chance of detecting entanglement in a small number of steps .",
    "the measurements in the blue shaded area suffice to detect all maximally entangled pure states with schmidt - basis vectors @xmath56 or @xmath57.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "our second algorithm for entanglement detection does not even require any initial measurements and directly applies also to mixed states .",
    "we will split the presentation into bipartite and multipartite cases .",
    "the decision tree provides an adaptive method to infer the next measurement setting from previous results .",
    "alice and bob choose three orthogonal local directions @xmath56 and @xmath57 independently from each other and agree to only measure correlations along these directions . in fig .",
    "[ fig_dt ] we show exemplarily which correlations should be measured in order to detect entanglement in a small number of steps . starting with a measurement of @xmath58 , one continues along the solid ( dotted ) arrow , if the correlation is higher ( lower ) than some threshold value @xmath59 .",
    "we performed detailed numerical analysis on how the efficiency of entanglement detection depends on the threshold value . the efficiency is quantified by the percentage of entangled states detected at various steps of the decision tree .",
    "it turns out that the efficiency does not depend much on the threshold value and the best results are obtained for @xmath60 .",
    "we therefore set this threshold value in all our simulations .",
    "the construction of the tree is based on the principle of correlation complementarity @xcite : in quantum mechanics there exist trade - offs for the knowledge of dichotomic observables with corresponding anti - commuting operators .",
    "for this reason , if the correlation @xmath61 is big , correlations @xmath62 and @xmath63 have to be small because their corresponding operators anti - commute with the operator @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the next significant correlations have to lie in the @xmath65 plane of the correlation tensor and the next step in the tree is to measure the @xmath66 correlation .    in cases",
    "in which going through the whole tree did not reveal entanglement we augmented it with additional measurements of correlations that were not established until that moment .",
    "the order of the additional measurements also results from the correlation complementarity . with every remaining measurement we associate the `` priority '' parameter @xmath67 that depends on the measurements of the decision tree in the following way @xmath68 according to the correlation complementarity",
    "if the value of the corresponding parameter is small there is a bigger chance that this correlation is significant .",
    "therefore , the correlations @xmath69 with lower values of @xmath70 are measured first .",
    "let us illustrate this on the following example .",
    "the measured correlations of the decision tree are as follows : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73",
    ". therefore , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "accordingly , the order of the remaining measurements is as follows : first measure @xmath65 , then @xmath77 , next @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "correlation complementarity , which holds also in the multipartite case , states that for a set @xmath80 of dichotomic mutually anti - commuting multiparty operators the following trade - off relation is satisfied by all physical states : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the expectation value of observable @xmath83 and so on .",
    "therefore , if one of the expectation values is maximal , say @xmath84 , the other anti - commuting observables have vanishing expectation values and do not have to be measured . in this way",
    "we exclude exponentially many , in the number of qubits , potential measurements because that many operators anti - commute with @xmath83 , and we apply correlation complementarity pairwise to @xmath83 and one of the anti - commuting operators .",
    "this motivates taking only sets of commuting operators along the branches of the decision tree that should be followed if the measured correlations are big .",
    "we are thus led to propose the following algorithm generating one branch of the decision tree in which the first measurement , called @xmath85 , is assumed to have a big expectation value .",
    "* generate all @xmath0-partite pauli operators that commute with @xmath85 .",

    "accordingly , their number is given by : @xmath87 , where @xmath88 if @xmath0 is odd , and @xmath89 otherwise .",

    "an exemplary class of density operators for which the decision tree detects all entangled states is provided by : @xmath138 i.e. the maximally entangled state is mixed with colored noise @xmath139 bringing anti - correlations along the local @xmath57 axes . for this case , quite common for type - ii parametric down - conversion sources , we obtain the following non - vanishing elements of its correlation tensor @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
