    "dust presents one of the biggest obstacles to interpreting observations of starburst galaxies in the optical and especially the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "the problem is difficult , because it depends not only on the amount of dust and its composition , but also the distribution of both dust and light sources .",
    "faced with such complexity , the astronomical community s response includes assuming that star formation remains mostly unobscured by dust  @xcite to deriding those who even consider that uv and optical observations can be corrected for dust  @xcite .",
    "here we use new and published observations to critically examine the importance of dust absorption in starburst galaxies , in order to answer the following : 1 .",
    "is dust important ? 2 .  what is the dust geometry",
    "3.how does dust effect broad band colors and fluxes ?",
    "4 . what does it do to emission line fluxes and line ratios ?",
    "_ can we recover the bolometric flux of a starburst from its uv or optical properties?_. the last question is a proxy for asking whether we can determine the star formation rate , but avoids distance uncertainties and assumptions about the lower end of the initial mass function ( imf ) .",

    "the samples are complementary .",
    "the iue sample contains a lot of dwarfs as well as starbursts with @xmath5 as high as @xmath6 .",
    "iue starbursts are good templates for high - redshift lyman break galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the iras sample includes the most luminous starbursts , the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( uligs : @xmath7 ) , but very few dwarfs .",
    "uligs make up @xmath8%  of the fir background  @xcite , but may be good templates for high - redshift sub - mm sources which could contribute significantly to the star formation rate density at @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "we consider two tracers of star formation : the uv continuum , and balmer emission lines .",
    "the uv continuum dominates the _ intrinsic _ ( before dust ) bolometric output of starbursts ( fig .",
    "[ introfigs]a ) , and is sensitive to main sequence stars with @xmath10 .",
    "the balmer lines are among the strongest in the optical and provide a good measure of the ionizing flux , and hence to stars having @xmath11 .",
    "the fir emission of a starburst represents the total luminosity absorbed by dust . for any star forming or young population ,",
    "the dust heating is dominated by the uv , hence the fir / uv flux ratio , or infrared excess ( irx ) can be transformed directly into an `` effective absorption '' .",
    "figure  [ introfigs]b plots irx versus uv spectral slope @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for both samples . here",
    "@xmath14 is a generalized flux @xmath15 evaluated at rest wavelength @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the flux density .",
    "almost all galaxies emit more in the fir than the uv , hence dust is clearly important for defining the spectral energy distribution . a strong correlation , the irx-@xmath12 relationship , is apparent for the iue sample and readily fit by a linear relationship between effective uv absorption and @xmath12  @xcite .    figure  [ bothsamp]a plots the absorption corrected uv flux , @xmath18 to @xmath19 ratio versus @xmath12 .",
    "the absorption comes from the fit plotted in fig .",
    ". the mean logarithmic ratio of the iue sample is @xmath20 with a scatter of 0.14  dex and no residual correlation with @xmath12 . for the iue starbursts ,",

    "very few uv observations of uligs exist , perhaps because they were expected to be so dusty as to be invisible in the uv . however recent observations of uligs from the ground at @xmath25    @xcite , and with hst at @xmath26    @xcite show that uligs do emit a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity in the uv .",
    "we obtained _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ uv images of seven galaxies with @xmath27  @xcite . in all cases",
    "the galaxies were detected in both the far uv ( rest @xmath28   ) and the near uv ( rest @xmath29   ) with some uv emission detected within a kpc of the nuclei  @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases the uv peak does not coincide well on the few hundred parcecs scale with the near ir emission .",
    "figures  [ introfigs]b and  [ bothsamp]a show that the irx-@xmath12 correlation underpredicts the bolometric flux of uligs by a factor ranging from @xmath30  7 to  90 .",
    "the situation is more optimistic with balmer lines as shown in fig .",
    "[ bothsamp]b which includes data on 28 iras galaxies with @xmath31 .",
    "the  fluxes were derived from narrow band images  @xcite , while spectra from a variety of published sources  @xcite were used to remove [ nii ] contamination and measure . after correcting for absorption ,",
    "uligs have similar @xmath32 to the iue starbursts , with a somewhat larger dispersion : 0.51 dex .",
    "one caveat is that these points represent total  fluxes corrected with _",
    "( @xmath33  kpc ) line ratios .",
    "gradients in @xmath22 may mean that we overestimated @xmath21 .",
    "large spatial variations certainly exist in some galaxies as shown by the two data point for arp220 in fig .",
    "[ bothsamp]b .",
    "however , on average the gradients are shallow with typically @xmath34 mag out to @xmath35 kpc ( where the contribution to the total  flux is small ) compared to @xmath36 mag in the center  @xcite . clearly , spectroscopy over the entire face of uligs is required to properly determine @xmath21 .",
    "there is precious little of this available in the literature .",
    "while we can not yet rule out a fortuitous coincidence , fig .",
    "[ bothsamp]b indicates that integrated balmer line fluxes can be used to predict the bolometric flux of starbursts to a factor of about three accuracy , even in most uligs .",
    "uv color and/or balmer line ratios can be used to crudely estimate the @xmath19 of starbursts , even uligs . when looking at large samples an accuracy of @xmath30 0.5  dex should be sufficient for measuring integrated star formation rate densities .",
    "the effective absorption implied by figs .",
    "[ introfigs]b  &  [ bothsamp]b is @xmath37  mag in the far uv , and @xmath38  mag in .",
    "five to ten magnitudes of dust absorption is large ( factor of  @xmath39 to  @xmath40 in attenuation ) , but not overwhelming .",
    "these results contradict the notion that star formation is essentially buried behind unmeasurabley large absorption in the uv and optical .",
    "why is this ?",
    "first of all , our results do not rule out some very buried star formation .",
    "perhaps the completely buried phase is of short duration , before stars migrate from their birth site or the surrounding dust and gas is cleared away by the supernovae  @xcite .",
    "this scenario may also explain the higher dust column density affecting emission lines compared to continuum radiation  @xcite .",
    "however , we have not found cases where all the star formation is buried behind several tens of magnitudes of absorption in both the uv and .",
    "some appropriately reddened emission usually gets out . secondly ,",
    "some claims for missing star formation are very model dependent .",
    "for example poggianti  @xcite mentioned a short fall of a factor of three in  derived star formation rates compared to fir estimates .",
    "however this is relative to a stellar population model of constant star formation rate with an assumed imf upper mass limit @xmath41  .",
    "a deficit of 0.5 dex compared to this model is completely consistent with our results ( fig .",
    "[ bothsamp]b ) which suggests @xmath42  may be more appropriate .",
    "aperture effects may be behind other claims of high extinction .",
    "for example sturm et al .",
    "@xcite use flux ratios of weak near to mid ir recombination and fine structure lines to infer a @xmath43 band dust absorption of 3080 mag for arp220 .",
    "however , the aperture size they use increases with wavelength , which can induce a spuriously large absorption since this source fills these apertures in  @xcite .",
    "the correlation of effective absorption with @xmath12 ( iue sample ) and balmer decrement ( both samples ) strongly suggests a foreground screen dust geometry  @xcite .",
    "while there is some hostility to such a model ( e.g.  @xcite ) , we have yet to see these correlations well modeled without a screen contribution . however , this screen is not likely to be a thin uniform sheet encompassing all star formation tracers , otherwise the uligs would fall on the same irx-@xmath12 relationship as the iue sample .",
    "the charlot and fall model  @xcite is a hybrid containing both foreground screen dust shells and mixed gas and dust .",
    "it works well for the iue galaxies and perhaps can be adapted to fit the iras sample as well .",
    "it should be no surprise that a foreground screen component is required , since a starburst can naturally produce such a screen .",
    "its stellar winds and supernovae will evacuate a cavity around the starburst and power a galactic wind  @xcite .",
    "most of the dust opacity will arise in the walls of this cavity .",
    "any molecular clouds that wander into the cavity will be compressed by the high pressure within the starburst and hence have a low covering factor .",
    "direct evidence for this scenario is given by heckman et al .",
    "@xcite who show that the metal content in the wind is directly related to the reddening .",
    "in particular , the depth of the blue shifted nai absorption line in starbursts correlates well with both the optical continuum color and the @xmath44 ratio .",
    "we conclude by answering the questions we posed at the start : 1 .",
    "yes , dust is important in most starbursts .",
    "the dust geometry includes a strong foreground screen contribution , probably arising in a galactic wind .",
    "3 .  dust reddens the uv colors as the flux is diminished in the iue starbursts , but this relationship breaks down for uligs .",
    "4.optical emission line flux ratios redden with increasing dust absorption for all types of starbursts .",
    "the bolometric flux of starbursts can be recovered from their uv color ( except uligs ) or more crudely , from balmer line flux ratios ( all starbursts ) .",
    "these results bode well for estimating the star formation rate density locally and out to high redshift from uv and optical surveys .",
    "* acknowledgements*. we thank the conference organizers for the opportunity to research this topic .",
    "this contribution is a progression from what was shown at the meeting ( including more points in fig .",
