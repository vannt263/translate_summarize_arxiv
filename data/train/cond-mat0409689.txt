    "the formation of ultracold diatomic molecules from feshbach resonances and photoassociation has witnessed spectacular developments in recent years .",
    "early demonstrations of molecule formation using two - photon raman photoassociation @xcite and a feshbach resonance @xcite were dominated by the molecular losses due to processes such as inelastic decay to lower energy molecular vibrational states @xcite , so that the existence of the molecules could only be inferred from the decrease in the number of atoms .",
    "the first unambiguous coherent conversion of atoms into molecules was performed by donley _",
    "@xcite , who exploited a feshbach resonance in a @xmath0rb bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . in subsequent experiments starting from an atomic condensate of @xmath1rb , rempe and coworkers used adiabatic rapid passage to create the molecules @xcite .",
    "because the molecules and atoms have different magnetic moments , they could be spatially separated from each other using a magnetic field gradient via the stern - gerlach effect .",
    "similar work has been conducted by xu _",
    "starting from a sodium bec , they used resonant laser light to blast away the remaining atoms in the sample and isolated the molecules .",
    "unfortunately , the conversion efficiency was limited by inelastic losses very close to the resonance so that molecular yields were @xmath2 .    for fermionic atoms close to a feshbach resonance the inelastic collision rate for relaxation to lower energy vibrational states of the molecules scales like @xmath3 whereas for bosons it scales like @xmath4 where @xmath4 is the scattering length near the resonance @xcite .",
    "this is because close to resonance the effective size of the molecules is of the order @xmath4 , which is comparable to the interparticle spacing . in order for a molecule to decay to a more deeply bound vibrational state with radius @xmath5",
    ", the atoms comprising the molecule along with an additional atom must all collide within a distance @xmath6 . since two of the three atoms",
    "are necessarily identical , the collision rate is suppressed for fermions .",
    "taking advantage of this consequence of the pauli exclusion principle , greiner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite achieved the first molecular bec by starting from a quantum degenerate spin mixture of @xmath7k using adiabatic rapid passage through a feshbach resonance with a conversion efficiency of @xmath8 . at about the same time",
    "_ @xcite and jochim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite succeeded in producing a bec of @xmath9li@xmath10 dimers by evaporatively cooling the atoms at a constant magnetic field just below a resonance where @xmath4 is large and positive .",
    "two recent experiments have led to the observation of heteronuclear feshbach resonances in bose - fermi mixtures of @xmath11li and @xmath12na @xcite in one case , and of @xmath1rb and @xmath7k in the other @xcite .",
    "we also mention recent experiments by kerman _",
    "@xcite , who produced metastable rbcs molecules in their lowest triplet state starting from a laser - cooled mixture of @xmath0rb and @xmath13cs by photoassociation .",
    "major current experimental and experimental efforts are directed towards the exploration of the crossover between the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state of fermionic atoms and bec of bosonic molecules as the system crosses a feshbach resonance @xcite . in the vicinity of these resonances ,",
    "the system enters a strongly interacting regime that offers a challenge for many - body theories @xcite .",
    "it is known that the pairing properties of finite - size systems can be significantly different from those of the bulk material , due to the discrete energy spectrum of the particles involved .",
    "the detailed role of the shell structure has been explored both in the nuclei  @xcite and of superconductor grains  @xcite , in which a collective character of pairs plays an important role . in this paper",
    "we consider the photoassociation of a dilute quantum - degenerate gas of fermionic atoms trapped in a spherically symmetric harmonic trap into molecular dimers , including the pairing interaction between fermions . by introducing a pseudo - spin formalism for the time reversal pairing operator  @xcite",
    ", this problem can be mapped onto an extension of the tavis - cummings model  @xcite that describes the coupling of @xmath14 two - level atoms and a single mode of the electromagnetic field , and has found applications in the study of superradiance in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "this analogy allows us to study in detail the ground state and lower excited states of the system , as well as the coherent dynamics of atom - molecule coupling in the trap .",
    "we show that for appropriate conditions , only those fermions on the last energy shell of the trap participate in the photoassociation process , and discuss the impact of the filling of that shell on molecule formation .",
    "we find that depending on the detuning @xmath15 of the photoassociation laser from the energy difference between the molecules and atom pairs , the nature of the ground state changes from being predominantly atomic to predominantly molecular in nature .",
    "we study the crossover between these two regions in detail , and quantify its property via the joint coherence of the atomic and molecular fields and the entanglement entropy of the system .",
    "the coherent conversion of fermions into bosons has been studied in the homogeneous case by several authors  @xcite .",
    "trapped systems , in addition to being closer to the experimental situation , present several unique characteristics : first , the discreteness of the energy levels eliminates many of the difficulties associated with a continuum .",
    "in addition , the high degeneracy of spherically symmetric harmonic potentials simplifies significantly the study of coherent quantum dynamics .",
    "indeed , the problem resembles then the dynamics of a bosonic josephson junction  @xcite , although the nonlinear coupling between fermionic atoms and bosonic molecules leads to considerably richer dynamics .",
    "moreover the additional pairing interaction between fermions is shown to result in a self - trapping transition  @xcite , with a sudden suppression of the coherent oscillations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii discusses our model and formulates it in terms of a pseudo - spin formalism .",
    "section iii presents results of the static problem where the many - body states are classified by number of unpaired fermions known as _ seniority _  @xcite in nuclear physics .",
    "we show that for a fixed number of atoms , the ground state of the system is always the state of minimum seniority .",
    "we examine the crossover behavior of the ground state as the detuning parameter @xmath15 is varied , as a function of the ratio of the total number of fermionic pairs and molecules to the degenerate number of the fermi level . the entanglement between fermions and bosons",
    "is evaluated and found to be reduced as the pairing interaction becomes stronger . in section iv",
    ", we analyze the coherent dynamics of the nonlinear atom - molecule coupling . using a semiclassical factorization ansatz",
    ", we show the appearance of a self - trapping transition in the presence of pairing interaction .",
    "an exact quantum solution shows that around that transition point the dynamics is characterized by large quantum fluctuations .",
    "finally , section v is a summary and outlook .",
    "calculational details are relegated to an appendix .",
    "we consider a trapped dilute gas of two - component fermionic atoms in hyperfine states of spin @xmath16 at zero temperature and coupled to a single - mode gas of bosonic molecules via a two - photon raman transition .",
    "the trap is assumed to be harmonic and spherically symmetric , described by the potential @xmath17 for the atoms , and similarly with @xmath18 for the bosonic molecules .    in the absence of interactions between particles ,",
    "the trap levels have the energies @xmath19 where the principal quantum number @xmath20 is positive or zero . in order to deal with the high degree of degeneracy of this potential ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the ( integer ) radial and angular quantum numbers @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are positive or zero , with @xcite @xmath23 each pair @xmath24 corresponds to a radial wave function @xmath25 and hence @xmath26 common eigenfunctions of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 taking into account the magnetic quantum number @xmath31 the degeneracy of each level @xmath32 is therefore @xmath33 and the total number of states up to the shell @xmath34 corresponding to the fermi energy @xmath35 is @xmath36 where the factor of 2 accounts for the two hyperfine spin states of the atoms . in the following , it will be necessary to include the attractive interaction responsible for the pairing between fermions .",
    "since as we show later on this interaction splits the degeneracy of the trap levels , we keep the angular momentum index in the labelling of the atomic energies , @xmath37 .",
    "the fermionic atoms are therefore described by the annihilation operator @xmath38 , where @xmath39 labels the hyperfine spin state of the atom with single - particle wave function @xmath40 and eigenenergy @xmath37 .    assuming that the atom - molecule photoassociation energy is smaller than the trap energy spacing , @xmath41 , and in addition that the system is sufficiently dilute that the attractive interaction between fermions is likewise less than @xmath41",
    ", it is possible to tune the frequency of the photoassociation laser so as to only couple fermions in the shell @xmath34 with fermi energy @xmath42 to molecules in the ground state of the harmonic trap .",
    "we can then ignore all shells other than the @xmath34-shell for the fermions , and all trap states above the ground state for the molecules , which are then described in terms of the ground state bosonic annihilation operator @xmath43 with single particle energy @xmath44 .",

    "<S> we consider the photoassociation of a low - density gas of quantum - degenerate trapped fermionic atoms into bosonic molecules in a spherically symmetric harmonic potential . for a dilute system and the photoassociation coupling energy small compared to the level separation of the trap , only those fermions in the single shell with fermi energy </S>",
    "<S> are coupled to the bosonic molecular field . introducing a collective pseudo - spin operator formalism </S>",
    "<S> we show that this system can then be mapped onto the tavis - cummings hamiltonian of quantum optics , with an additional pairing interaction . by exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the ground state and low excitations of the bose - fermi system , and study the dynamics of the coherent coupling between atoms and molecules . in a semiclassical description of the system </S>",
    "<S> , the pairing interaction between fermions is shown to result in a self - trapping transition in the photoassociation , with a sudden suppression of the coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the full quantum dynamics of the system is dominated by quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of the self - trapping solution . </S>"
