    "the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) is an undistinguished region in the sky , located at @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "it is , however , a very special region since many astronomical satellites have accumulated a large number of exposures over this location since earth - orbiting satellites must point their fixed solar panels to the sun and be in their orbits over the ecliptic poles . unlike the south ecliptic pole ( sep ) region where the south atlantic anomaly and the lmc prevent the clear view of the extragalactic sky at certain wavelengths ,",
    "the nep region suffers very little or no obscuration by foreground galactic sources .",
    "the galactic coordinates of the nep are @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the foreground extinction in this direction is @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the nep is a good target for deep , unbiased , contiguous surveys for extragalactic objects such as galaxies , galaxy clusters , and agns .",
    "the @xmath15 all - sky survey ( rass ) is one of the most representative surveys of the nep region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 was the first x - ray imaging satellite to survey the entire sky .",
    "a source catalog of x - ray sources that were extracted from a large area surrounding the nep was constructed from this rass data @xcite . from the followup observations and optical counterpart investigations",
    ", @xcite reported that most x - ray sources in the nep region are agns ( @xmath16 ) , stars ( @xmath17 ) , and galaxy groups / clusters ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xcite also found a supercluster of galaxies in the nep region using the rass data and suggested that some galaxy clusters in this region are part of the supercluster at z = 0.087 .",
    "the nep region was also observed in the 1.5 ghz band by @xcite . using this radio source catalog",
    ", @xcite investigated the correlation between the radio sources and the rass x - ray sources , and identified optical counterparts of the radio / x - ray sources .",
    "they found that a significant number of radio loud sources are also bright in the x - ray band , and that x - ray selection is an effective way for the search of galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "while the x - ray luminosity is an efficient measure of the hot ionized gas in the galaxy clusters , the star formation activities and the resultant stellar mass in galaxies can be estimated from the optical and infrared flux .",
    "recently , a new infrared space telescope , named akari , was launched in february 2006 .",
    "akari is expected to give exceedingly higher quality data than the previous infrared space missions such as _ infrared astronomical satellite _ @xcite and _ infrared space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the akari data will also complement the successful _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite data by providing better wavelength coverage over the @xmath19 m band , which is not available from the _ spitzer_. as one of its major science programs , akari is currently carrying out deep near - to - mid infrared surveys over the wide area around the nep through two major survey programs , ` nep - deep ' and ` nep - wide . '",
    "the key scientific objectives of these nep surveys are to unveil the dusty star formation history of the universe , the mass assembly and large scale structure evolution , and the nature of the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) . for further information on these nep programs",
    ", please refer to @xcite .",
    "combined with these space - borne infrared surveys , the optical survey of the nep region constitutes the multifrequency dataset that is essential for the studies of cosmic star formation history .",
    "many researchers have investigated optical counterparts of radio and x - ray sources in this region , but , for the imaging data , they mostly relied on the cosmos scan ( e.g. , brinkmann et al . 1999 ) or digitized sky survey images of the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - ii ) plates , only complemented by some independent but patchy observations ( e.g. , gioia et al .",
    "although the poss - ii data are excellent in complete coverage of the whole sky , the usefulness of the data are still limited by the low resolution with @xmath20 per pixel scale and the shallow depth with the limiting magnitude of @xmath21 mag @xcite . in this study , therefore , we provide the first optical catalog of sources in the nep region based on deep observations in @xmath22 bands obtained with megacam at cfht .",
    "this optical catalog will be an important part of multifrequency datasets of galactic and extragalactic sources in the nep region .",
    "it will also serve as a basis of the akari nep survey mission by providing the information on the optical counterparts of the infrared sources .",
    "this paper is composed as follows : we describe our observations in section 2 and data reduction procedures in section 3 .",
    "we present a bright source catalog in section 4.1 , photometric properties of the sources in the nep region in section 4.2 , and galaxy number counts in section 4.3 .",
    "the result of galaxy cluster search using the color of red sequence galaxies is given in sections 4.4 and 4.5 .",
    "some photometric properties of other x - ray sources are presented in section 4.6 and our primary results are summarized in the last section .",
    "the observation of the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) region was carried out over nine photometric nights between august 22 and september 22 , 2004 using the 3.6 m cfht telescope located at mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we used a wide field imager megacam at the telescope primary focus megaprime .",
    "the megacam is composed of 36 2048 @xmath23 4612 ccd s covering about 1@xmath24 area with 0.185 arc seconds resolution per pixel @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 filter system provided with megacam is basically the same as that used by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite except for the @xmath0 filter which is designed to take advantage of the improved uv extinction condition at the cfht site .",
    "therefore , the photometric data generated from this observation are presented in the cfht unique @xmath0 and the sdss @xmath26 system . for further information on these filter systems used with megacam ,",
    "see the ` filter set ' section in http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/instruments/imaging/megaprime/specsinformation.html page .    as shown in figure [ map ] , the observed fields are composed of two fields separated by about 1@xmath27 away from each other in the east - west direction , covering about two square degrees in total .",
    "the nep - e ( east ) field was observed with five filters , @xmath25 and the other field , nep - w ( west ) , was observed with only four filters , @xmath26 .",
    "each field was covered twice with a 15@xmath28 offset for dithering in each filter with total exposure times of 3600 sec for @xmath0 ( 1800 @xmath23 2 ) , 2400 sec for @xmath1 ( 1200 @xmath23 2 ) , 3000 sec for @xmath2 ( 1500 @xmath23 2 ) , 3000 sec for @xmath3 ( 1500 @xmath23 2 ) , and 3600 sec for @xmath4 ( 1800 @xmath23 2 ) .",
    "the raw images were processed using elixir system by cfht staff .",
    "the elixir is a collection of programs , databases , and other tools specialized in processing and evaluation of the large mosaic data @xcite .",
    "the overall quality of the preprocessed images is good with a typical seeing of @xmath29 .",
    "detailed information on the observation is listed in table [ obslog ] .",
    "for the reliable source detection and photometry , it is essential to prepare a master image that satisfies the following two factors : ( 1 ) to obtain the required photometric depth and ( 2 ) to give the complete areal coverage .",
    "we used a software package swarp written by e. bertin at terapix to transform each multi extension fits ( mef ) file containing 36 individual ccd frames into a single fits image data .",
    "swarp also corrects different distortion effects between input data through the resampling process , and then combines the resampled images to create a deep output image after flux scaling and background subtraction .    to make a master image , we combined the @xmath26 four band data using swarp for the nep - e and the nep - w field respectively . during the swarp run ,",
    "bilinear resampling method was used since this method was found to be effective in suppressing the discontinuity effects around the chip boundaries , while other methods such as lanczos3 produced more noticeable discontinuities .",
    "we also used weighted images during swarp run to enhance the quality of the output image . in the weight maps we assigned zero weights to pixels with negative values .",
    "we excluded the @xmath0 band data from the master image construction since we do not have the @xmath0 band data for the nep - w and the s / n is relatively lower compared to other bands .",
    "finally , we created two master detection images with high s / n s , one for the nep - e and the other for the nep - w region .",
    "two mef images for each band were processed using swarp with the same parameters to generate a final photometry image for the corresponding filter .",
    "these @xmath25 band images were made to have the same dimension and coordinates with the master detection image of the corresponding field .",
    "the depth of photometry attained by combining two raw images was calculated as @xmath30 flux over a circular aperture with 1 @xmath28 diameter .",
    "the measured limiting magnitudes are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 mag , as listed in table [ obslog ] .",
    "after all these processings , two master detection images and nine photometry images were prepared for the source detection and photometry .",
    "all the information on the reduced photometry images will be available from an web site http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~  nhwang / index.files / nep.html .",
    "we have used sextractor @xcite to detect sources from the master detection images of the nep - e and nep - w fields . a source is confirmed if it has more than five contiguous pixels above four times the background sky fluctuation .",
    "the signals from each source were measured in the @xmath25 band photometry images over the isophotal area previously defined during the source detection .",
    "the photometry was made using sextractor in dual mode operation .",
    "this scheme enables the detection and photometry of any source that is registered at least once in any of the @xmath26 band images .",
    "the total number of sources detected in our two observed nep fields is about 130,000 .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were transformed into standard magnitudes using the transformation information provided and recorded in the header of the images by the cfht staff . during this transformation ,",
    "only the calibrated magnitudes of sources that have available color information required for the calibration are calculated and kept in the catalog .",
    "otherwise , we assigned dummy values ( 99.000 ) to the magnitudes of sources in the final source catalog .",
    "figure [ mhist ] displays a source count histogram in the @xmath25 band along with the @xmath2 band error and stellarity distributions .",
    "this shows that the number of sources in our data increases up to @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 mag before the incompleteness effect starts to take place and the number of the detected sources starts to decrease .",
    "the @xmath2 band magnitude error is estimated to be about 0.1 mag or less at @xmath38 mag where the source count reaches its maximum .",
    "the stellarity distribution shows how efficiently the star / galaxy classifier works in our dataset . from this distribution",
    ", it is clearly seen that the stellarity index , which is calculated by sextractor based on the isophotal areas , peak intensity , and seeing information , separates the point sources ( stellarity @xmath41 1 ) and the extended sources ( stellarity @xmath42 ) with high confidence for the sources with @xmath43 mag .",
    "one more point to be noted in this stellarity distribution is that sources with @xmath44 mag and stellarity @xmath45 are the results of the image saturation .",
    "thus the stellarity index is most relable in the magnitude range of @xmath46 mag .      considering the source count and the stellarity distribution ,",
    "we have decided the magnitude range of the most reliable sources for the final bright source catalog entry , which is @xmath47 23 mag .",
    "the number of sources compiled in the final bright source catalog is about 56,000 .",
    "table [ nepcat ] lists a sample of the bright source catalog for reader s guide and the full source catalog will be available electronically from the online journal and from an web site http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~  nhwang / index.files / nep.html .",

    "column 1 is the identification number of an optical source .",
    "column 2 & 3 list , respectively , the j2000.0 right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) of a source in degrees .",
    "the uncertainties of the astrometric solution derived by elixir are about @xmath48 .",
    "column 4 @xmath41 13 are the ab magnitudes and magnitude errors of a source in the @xmath25 bands .",
    "these are given by mag_auto and magerr_auto parameters of sextractor , which are kron - like elliptical aperture magnitudes and their errors .",
    "column 14 is the extraction flag of a source given as a sum of powers of 2 by sextractor .",
    "if a source has neighbors ( flag = 1 ) and is blended with another source ( flag = 2 ) and some pixels are saturated ( flag = 4 ) , then the final extraction flag given to the source is 7 (= 1 + 4 + 2 ) .",
    "generally , a source with the extraction flag 0 gives the most reliable photometry .",
    "for detailed information on this flag , see the sextractor user s manual .",
    "column 15 is the stellarity index of a source calculated from a @xmath26 combined detection image .",
    "this index has a value between 1 ( point sources ) and 0 ( extended sources ) .",
    "see figure [ mhist ] for the distribution of this index .",
    "column 16 is the ellipticity of a source calculated by sextractor using the second order image moments .",
    "column 17 is the fwhm in arcseconds of a source calculated under the assumption that the source has a gaussian profile .",
    "column 18 is the effective radius or a half - light radius of a source in arcseconds .",
    "this value is computed by setting the input parameter phot_fluxfrac = 0.5 and is given by the output parameter flux_radius .",
    "column 19 is the semi - major axis of a source in arcseconds .",
    "column 20 is the detected isophotal area of a source .",
    "this parameter may be used as a measure of the object s size for the case of extended sources .",
    "column 21 is the field number that the photometric data of a source comes from .",
    "the field number 1 represents the nep - e field and 2 represents the nep - w field .",
    "we have investigated the photometric properties of the nep sources using several color - magnitude and color - color diagrams . in each diagram",
    ", we use the stellarity index given by sextractor to distinguish between point sources and extended sources : stellarity @xmath49 for point sources ( mostly stars ) and stellarity @xmath50 for extended sources ( mostly galaxies ) .",
    "they are found to be statistically very useful tools to separate stars and galaxies brighter than @xmath51 mag from all kinds of sources in the catalog .",
    "the @xmath2 vs @xmath52 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and @xmath52 color histogram in figure [ grrcmd ] shows two prominent vertical sequences of point sources , i.e. , stars at @xmath53 0.3 ( g dwarf stars ) and 1.4 ( m giant stars ) , respectively .",
    "the extended sources , presumably galaxies , are seen to be concentrated around the peak at @xmath53 0.8 that corresponds to the @xmath52 color of early type galaxies @xcite . the extended sources start to dominate at @xmath54 22 mag and fainter",
    ". some of these sources may be faint stars that the sextractor failed to classify as point sources .",
    "however , the different @xmath52 color histograms of the extended and the point sources suggest that the majority of these faint extended sources are galaxies .    figure [ urrcmd ] displays the @xmath2 vs @xmath55 cmd and @xmath55 color histogram of sources in the nep - e field .",
    "the cmd shows that there are many galaxies distributed around @xmath56 1.0 as shown in the @xmath55 color histogram of extended sources .",
    "this value is consistent with the @xmath55 color of scd type galaxies @xcite , whereas the @xmath52 color of most galaxies in figure [ grrcmd ] is that of early type galaxies .",
    "it is also noted that there is a very long redward tail in the @xmath55 color distribution of extended sources , reaching nearly @xmath57 4 or higher .",
    "the elliptical galaxies can be as red as @xmath56 2.8 @xcite .",
    "therefore , some of those faint and red sources with @xmath58 could be distant galaxies with redshift @xmath59",
    ".    figures [ grriccd ] through [ urgzccd ] show the characteristic distribution of point sources and extended sources in three color - color diagrams : @xmath60 vs @xmath52 , @xmath61 vs @xmath60 , and @xmath62 vs @xmath55 .",
    "the most prominent feature in these color - color diagrams ( ccd s ) is very distinguishable sequences of point sources , i.e. stars . in figure",
    "[ grriccd ] , the stellar sequence in a flipped ` l ' shape has a very narrow width of about 0.2 dex in the @xmath60 vs @xmath52 color space .",

    "extended sources are found to populate in a relatively well constrained color space centered at a certain color .",
    "it is still clear that we can not possibly separate extended sources from point sources by simply constraining colors in the @xmath60 vs @xmath52 and the @xmath61 vs @xmath60 color - color space .",
    "however , figure [ urgzccd ] shows that the @xmath62 vs @xmath55 color - color combination enables us to define the two exclusive spaces that are mostly populated by stars and galaxies , respectively .",
    "the boundary of these regions can be drawn by combination of three straight lines connecting @xmath63 = @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "this is a very useful tool for separating faint galaxies from stars to search for distant galaxy clusters or to compute the 2d correlation function of galaxies .",
    "we have investigated the galaxy number counts using the nep optical source catalog .",
    "to select galaxies efficiently from the photometry catalog , we adopted two different definitions of galaxies : ( 1 ) ` galaxy i ' sources with stellarity @xmath50 and ( 2 ) ` galaxy ii ' sources that belong to the designated area where the extended sources appeared to occupy in the @xmath55 vs @xmath62 ccd as denoted by the dashed line in figure [ urgzccd ] .",
    "the results of number counts for galaxy i and galaxy ii sample , as shown in figure [ galcount ] , show a consistent rise from @xmath68 mag up to about @xmath69 mag and then a steep down turn due to the incompleteness at @xmath70 mag . from the lower and mid panels of figure [ galcount ]",
    ", it is clear that galaxy ii sample outnumbers galaxy i sample in @xmath71 mag .",
    "this difference between number counts is mostly due to the deteriorating reliability of stellarity index in @xmath70 mag , as shown in the upper panel of figure [ mhist ] .",
    "therefore , the galaxy i sample is likely to lose a large number of faint galaxies compared to the galaxy ii sample .    in figure",
    "[ galcount ] , we also plotted the r - band galaxy number count of @xcite for comparison after a simple transformation into @xmath2 band . @xcite",
    "derived the number count of extended sources by modeling the number count distribution of point - like sources ( star ) and then subtracting the extrapolated model count of point - like sources from the detected source count .",
    "on the other hand , we defined galaxies as a certain part of all the detected sources that satisfy a given stellarity condition ( galaxy i ) or a given two - color criterion ( galaxy ii )",
    ". nonetheless , it is clear from the plot that the number count by @xcite is generally consistent with our result except for the differences in the faint magnitude domain where the incompleteness becomes significant .    as shown in the mid panel of figure [ galcount ] , the logarithmic number counts defined as @xmath72 also display very similar slopes over the range of @xmath73 mag .",
    "simple linear square fits over that magnitude range returned the slope d(logn)/dm = 0.387 for galaxy i , 0.408 for galaxy ii , and 0.397 for @xcite data .",
    "the errors of the fitted slopes are about @xmath74 for all cases .",
    "therefore , the slopes of logarithmic galaxy number counts are in good agreement with that of @xcite within the errors .",
    "however , there are some differences in several minor features between the logarithmic profiles of galaxy number count .",
    "this is more clearly shown in the upper panel of figure [ galcount ] .",
    "it is apparent that there are two small dips in galaxy ii data : one at @xmath75 mag and another smooth one at @xmath76 mag .",
    "the first dip also appears to exist in @xcite data but the second smooth and shallow dip could not be identified from @xcite data in this plot .",
    "however , the magnitude of the second dip is roughly coincident with the break point at @xmath77 mag as shown in their figure 4 . ,",
    "is made with 0.5 mag bin .",
    "the use of 0.5 mag bin instead of 0.25 mag bin in the number count is considered to cause the smoothing out the feature . ]",
    "we have carried out a galaxy cluster search using our optical photometry catalog . among numerous galaxy cluster finding methods available",
    ", we adopted a simplified version of the ` c4 cluster finding algorithm ' by @xcite that utilizes a seven - dimensional position and color space . in this study , we use only a three - dimensional color space constructed based on @xmath52 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 colors to select cluster member galaxies and then we investigate the spatial distribution of the selected galaxies to find any overdensity of these galaxies in small regions .",
    "finally , the cmds of any overdense region are consulted to check whether the red sequence of galaxies is apparent before we identify the region as a galaxy cluster .",
    "this approach requires the definition of color ranges spanned by the cluster member galaxies with various redshifts and richness classes before the actual application to the photometric data .",
    "we have used the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite data for this purpose .",
    "the sdss project provides a huge amount of multiband photometric and spectroscopic data over a large sky area .",
    "this enables us to select cluster member galaxies using the spectroscopy information and to reduce the possible contamination by field galaxies and stars .",
    "one more advantage of using the sdss dataset to define color ranges occupied by cluster member galaxies is that the sdss filter system is the same as the megacam filter system of cfht except for the @xmath0 filter ( see section [ obs ] for details ) .",
    "therefore , we have searched the sdss database and retrieved photometric and spectroscopic data of nearby galaxy clusters for the calibration of the red sequence colors in the sdss filter system .",
    "we have searched the sdss dr5 database @xcite and found 101 nearby abell galaxy clusters whose @xmath78 filter is the sloan system , which is different from the cfht @xmath0 system .",

    "application of these parameters finally returned about 1,700 early type galaxies in 88 clusters and the number of early type galaxies in each cluster runs from 4 ( a2192 ) to 73 ( a2199 ) depending on the redshift and the richness class .",

    "this indicates that those bright galaxies may happen to be located in front of the faint background galaxies by chance .",
    "therefore , we suggest that these galaxies are members of a galaxy group rather than a galaxy cluster . the red sequence s @xmath92 color is about 0.793 , corresponding to an estimated redshift of @xmath109 .",
    "the relative large error may be due to the poorly determined slope of red sequence depends sensitively on several bright galaxies with @xmath110 mag .",
    "there is a known x - ray source rx j1757.9 + 6609 at the similar position .",
    "it is listed as a type 2 agn with redshift @xmath111 in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "a type 2 agn is a narrow emission line ( fwhm @xmath112 km @xmath113 ) object , while a type 1 agn is a broad emission line ( fwhm @xmath114 km @xmath113 ) object @xcite .",
    "the spatial number density plot ( lower panel ) of the red sequence galaxies in figure [ zone6 ] shows some clustering in the 2d projected space .",
    "this point was also noted by @xcite who carried out a cluster search using the digitized second palomar observatory sky survey ( dposs ) data .",
    "they detected an overdensity of galaxies at this location and listed it as a galaxy cluster candidate under the name of nsc j175751 + 660924 , and also estimated its redshift to be @xmath115 from their photometric redshift analysis .",
    "our photometric data shows well developed red sequences running from @xmath116 mag in @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 colors , confirming that it is a genuine galaxy cluster .",
    "the red sequence s @xmath92 color is about 0.811 and this leads to the estimated redshift of @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , there appears to be a galaxy cluster with redshift @xmath118 and a type 2 agn with redshift @xmath119 in the background of the same projected area .",
    "we have identified two galaxy clusters and one galaxy group by applying the simple color cut method to our photometry catalog . however , there are two more galaxy clusters that are listed in the literature in our observation field that we failed to confirm .",
    "one is rx j1801.7 + 6637 ( @xmath120 ) reported by @xcite and the other is rx j1757.3 + 6631 ( @xmath121 ) from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "there appear to be some weak hints of clustering around these clusters on the images .",
    "but our photometry is not deep enough to identify any red sequence of galaxies in the cmd of the galaxies .",
    "the photometric properties of various x - ray sources such as stars , agns , bl lac s could provide valuable information regarding their stellar populations and evolution .",
    "comparison of our photometry catalog with the x - ray source catalog of @xcite returned about 25 possible matches .",
    "based on the classification information of the x - ray sources by @xcite , we have investigated the photometric property of each object class using several cmds and ccds .",
    "figure [ h06cmd ] shows a @xmath52 vs @xmath2 cmd and the three different ccds of various optical counterparts of x - ray sources . for a guideline in each diagram , the distribution of point sources , which are mostly stars , is also plotted .    in figure",
    "[ h06cmd ] , it is easily seen that ( 1 ) generally , x - ray bright stars do not belong to the well defined stellar sequence in each diagram , and ( 2 ) agns and bl lac objects are not readily separated from stars or other kind of objects in these cmds and ccds .",
    "most x - ray bright stars that are used in this comparison are very bright ( @xmath122 mag ) and are mostly saturated except for one faint giant star as shown in the upper - left panel of figure [ h06cmd ] .",
    "this may explain why these x - ray bright stars appear to be in different color domains from other generic stars .",
    "even one faint star ( marked by a star with a circle in figure [ h06cmd ] ) is bluer in @xmath55 color than normal stars .",
    "although agns and bl lac s as a whole do not show any distinct pattern in each color , the agn1s with stellarity @xmath123 , which are relatively free from wrong identification , are found only in the blue domains of @xmath52 , @xmath60 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath52 cmd also shows that any sources with @xmath124 and @xmath125 mag are very likely to be agn or bl lac objects .",
    "we have obtained @xmath25 optical band high resolution images of the two square degrees area centered at the nep with megacam / megaprime at cfht . from the source detection and the photometry using sextractor , we have compiled about 56,000 sources with @xmath126 mag , including point and extended sources , into the final optical photometry catalog as listed in table [ cat ] . the use of the color - magnitude diagrams and color - color diagrams revealed strikingly different photometric characteristics of stars and galaxies .",
    "we have found that the use of @xmath55 vs @xmath62 color enables us to clearly separate galaxies from stars and this separation does not suffer from the uncertainties involved in the morphological classification of faint sources .",
    "the galaxy number counts constructed from the galaxies selected based on the @xmath55 vs @xmath62 color show a nearly monotonic increase up to about @xmath69 mag with a slope d(logn)/dm @xmath127 , which is in agreement with the literature .",
    "however , there are some changes in the slope at @xmath128 mag and @xmath129 mag , which needs further studies .    using the sdss dr5 data of the 101 nearby abell galaxy clusters with redshift @xmath118",
    ", we have derived a relation between the redshift and the color of the red sequences in the sdss filter system which is compatible with the cfht megacam filter system . utilizing the information derived from the nearby galaxy clusters , we have applied a simple color cut method to find galaxy clusters in our data field , which returned two galaxy clusters and one galaxy group .",
    "these galaxy clusters and group are also radio and x - ray sources , which were reported by previous studies .",
    "we have also estimated the redshift of these galaxy clusters and group using the linear relation between the @xmath92 color and the redshift .",
    "the estimated redshift is in agreement with the known value of 0.09 for galaxies in nepx1 but it is relatively lower than the spectroscopic redshift in the literature for galaxies in rx j1754.7 + 6623 and the photometrically derived redshift for rx j1757.9 + 6609 . for rx j1754.7 + 6623 , this underestimation of redshift may be due to the poorly determined slope of red sequence since there are only a few bright galaxies . for rx j1757.9 + 6609",
    ", the galaxy cluster seems to be overlayed on the background type 2 agn with redshift of 0.4875 .",
    "we have compared our photometry catalog with an x - ray source catalog in the literature to investigate the photometric properties of other x - ray sources .",
    "the result of comparison implies that the sources with @xmath130 could be classified as candidates of agns or bl lac objects .",
