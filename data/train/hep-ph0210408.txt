    "there has recently been much interest @xcite in whether the higgs boson could be easier observed , or even discovered , in diffractive scattering events at hadron colliders , _ viz .",
    "_  @xmath1  at the fermilab tevatron or @xmath6 at cern s future large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the underlying idea is that the lower hadronic activity in such events with large rapidity gaps should improve the possibility to reconstruct the higgs from its decay products .",
    "one crucial issue is whether the cross section for diffractive higgs production is large enough to give an observable rate .",
    "theoretical predictions based on different models vary by orders of magnitude and it is therefore important to check and constrain these models in various ways .    another crucial issue is which decay mode of the higgs that is considered .",
    "although @xmath2 ( fig .  [ fig - diagrams]b ) has a small branching ratio , its very clear experimental signature with two high-@xmath7 photons makes it interesting and often considered for a higgs of intermediate mass .    in this note",
    "we will address both these crucial issues .",
    "our prediction @xcite for the diffractive higgs cross section is given additional credibility by further experimental checks supporting our soft color interaction ( sci ) model .",
    "the @xmath2 channel is further considered by investigating the background from prompt @xmath8 production .",
    "the process @xmath4 is similar to the dominating higgs production process @xmath5 , both involving gluon - gluon fusion into a quark loop ( fig .",
    "[ fig - diagrams ] ) .",
    "the experimental observation of prompt photon pairs in rapidity gap events can therefore be used to test the models for diffractive higgs production .",
    "we therefore give predictions on such prompt photon events based on our model .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     at lhc , the high energy and luminosity facilitates a study of single diffractive higgs production , where also the striking @xmath9 decay should be observed . also a few dpe higgs events may be observed , but these events will not be as clean as naively expected .",
    "the available energy is here enough to produce the higgs and the leading protons as well as an underlying event that will populate forward detector rapidity regions with particles @xcite .",
    "this causes a much lower diffractive cross section when requiring a gap instead of a leading proton at lhc .",
    "the @xmath2 decay mode is of experimental interest due to its clear signature with two photons of high @xmath7 ( up to @xmath10 ) .",
    "its branching ratio is , however , quite low since it proceeds via a higher order loop diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig - diagrams]b ) and is only of interest for an intermediate mass higgs , below the thresholds for decaying into @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "as the higgs mass increases from @xmath13 gev to @xmath14 gev , the branching ratio decreases from about @xmath15 to about @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "therefore , this decay mode gives too low rates to be observable in diffractive interactions ( table  [ tab - higgs ] ) , except for a handful @xmath2 in single diffraction at lhc .",
    "concerning the backgrounds to this higgs signal , the requirement of the two high-@xmath7 photons to be essentially back - to - back in the transverse plane and isolated , removes the major backgrounds of photons as decay products in jets .",
    "the serious , irreducible background is given by the production of a pair of prompt high-@xmath7 photons from the hard processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - diagrams]cd ) . as above",
    ", we simulate these processes with pythia  including the sci model and obtain the inclusive cross sections , as well as the single diffractive and dpe ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - gammagamma ] .",
    "the tevatron cross sections for diffractive higgs and prompt photons with high mass are very suppressed due to kinematics at the edge of phase space , while at the lhc , this kinematic suppression is much less pronounced .",
    "as can be seen , the irreducible prompt @xmath8 background is larger , in particular at the tevatron , than the cross section times the branching ratio for @xmath2 .",
    "this applies to inclusive , sd and dpe events when considering a bin width of only @xmath171  gev , corresponding to the width of a higgs with @xmath14  gev and a detector with good energy resolution . for a higgs of lower mass",
    "the width is much smaller , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath1710  mev at @xmath18  gev , such that the @xmath2 signal could in priciple stand out from the background in 10  mev bins obtained from a detector with extremely high energy resolution .",
    "to be realistic , however , we must unfortunately conclude that @xmath8 is not a straightforward signal for observing the higgs boson .",
    "on the other hand , the prompt @xmath8 production has a large enough cross section to be investigated in diffractive events . at the tevatron ,",
    "observable rates are predicted for sd events with @xmath19 up to @xmath20 gev , so the model can be tested against data even up to scales of order @xmath10 , but for dpe , @xmath19 is only observable up to 15 - 20 gev . for large @xmath19 the leading order subprocess @xmath3 dominates . the higher order process @xmath4 dominates , however , at lower @xmath19 where the momentum fraction @xmath21 of the initial partons can be smaller and the large gluon density of the proton increases the cross section .",
    "therefore , in order to test the model for a similar gluon - gluon fusion process with a quark loop as in higgs production , one should consider @xmath19 up to @xmath22 gev for sd and up to @xmath23 gev for dpe ( fig .",
    "[ fig - gammagamma]b ) .    similarly at the lhc , prompt @xmath8 gives observable rates for sd for @xmath19 up to @xmath24 gev and for dpe up to @xmath25 gev , _",
    "i.e. _  up to the scale of @xmath10 . the process @xmath4 dominates for values of @xmath19 below @xmath26 gev for sd and below @xmath27 gev for dpe .",
    "thus , the basic mechanism for producing rapidity gap events with a high mass state from @xmath28 fusion via a quark loop can be tested already at the tevatron and further investigated at the lhc .",
    "diffractive higgs production is currently considered with great interest for forthcoming investigations at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "different theoretical models predict quite different magnitudes of the cross section , as discussed recently @xcite . in this context ,",
    "diffractive prompt @xmath8 production can be used as a further testing ground for the models . in particular",
    ", the contributing subprocess @xmath4 involves a similar gluon - gluon fusion process via a quark loop as in higgs production .",
    "although models based on pomeron exchange can be made to fit diffractive hard scattering data at both hera and the tevatron , they have conceptual and theoretical problems as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it seems improper to regard the pomeron as ` emitted ' from the proton and having qcd evolution as a separate entity .",
    "this problem is avoided in the soft color interaction model which , although not having a firm theoretical basis , can be seen as an effective model for final state interactions as discussed theoretically in @xcite .",
    "this sci model has , furthermore , strong phenomenological support since it has been very successful in describing and predicting diffractive hard scattering processes both in @xmath0 collisions at hera and @xmath1  at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the sci model describes well the production of dijets in dpe events  a process which has similar dynamics to dpe higgs and has been advocated  @xcite as a testing ground for different models aiming at describing diffractive higgs .",
    "based on the sci model , we find that the rate of diffractive higgs events at the tevatron will be too low to be useful .",
    "some single diffractive higgs events should be produced , but they can only be accessed through the @xmath29 decay channel which does not provide a clear signal in view of the large qcd background and non - trivial experimental @xmath30 reconstruction .",
    "the higgs must , therefore , be primarily searched for in inclusive events with their more complex underlying event .",
    "the situation is quite different at lhc .",
    "here single diffractive higgs production can be investigated , including a few events with the striking @xmath2 decay mode , and a few dpe events with a higgs should also be produced .",
    "diffractive events are , however , not so clean at the lhc since the large available energy produces underlying event activity extending to larger forward rapidities making observable gaps less abundant .",
    "therefore , a much larger sample of diffractive higgs events would be obtained by very forward ` roman pot'-type proton tagging detectors .",
    "we furthermore find that the @xmath2 signal in all cases has a smaller cross section than the irreducible background of prompt @xmath8 production .",
    "as discussed above , the latter process is interesting in its own right and our model gives observably large cross sections both at the tevatron and lhc , such that prompt @xmath8 event samples should be obtained inclusively as well as in single diffraction and dpe .",
    "a one to two orders of magnitude larger cross section for prompt @xmath8 in dpe was predicted in @xcite based on a pomeron model , but the uncertainty was considered large due to the poorly constrained reggeon exchanges .",
    "thus , the investigation of diffractive prompt @xmath8 production at the tevatron is essential to test the models for diffractive hard scattering and obtain safer predictions for diffractive higgs production at the lhc .",
