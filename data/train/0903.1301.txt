    "the decay @xmath13 is among the largest known branching fractions for the @xmath14 meson . for some time the mode @xmath15 was used as the normalizing mode for @xmath14 decay branching fractions , typically done by choosing events with the @xmath16 invariant mass near the narrow @xmath17 peak .",
    "observation of a large contribution from @xmath18 @xcite makes the selection of @xmath15 dependent on the range of @xmath16 invariant mass chosen ; the observed yield of non-@xmath19 contributions can be larger than 10%  @xcite .",
    "this is an unacceptably large uncertainty for a normalizing mode and we proposed  @xcite that the branching fraction for @xmath13 in the neighborhood of the @xmath19 peak , without any attempt to identify the @xmath20 component as such , could be used for @xmath14 normalization .",
    "relating the @xmath13 branching fraction in  @xcite to the rates for such phase space - restricted subsets requires an understanding of the resonance contributions to the final state .",
    "the only published dalitz plot analysis  @xcite has been done by e687 @xcite using 701 signal events .",
    "the focus collaboration has studied this decay in a dalitz plot analysis in an unpublished thesis @xcite and a conference presentation @xcite .    here",
    "we describe a dalitz plot analysis of @xmath13 using the cleo - c data set which yields a sample of over @xmath21 signal candidates .",
    "charge conjugation is implied throughout except where explicitly mentioned .",
    "the next section describes our experimental techniques , the third section gives our dalitz plot analysis formalism , the fourth describes our fits to the data , and there is a brief conclusion .",
    "cleo - c is a general purpose detector which includes a tracking system for measuring momenta and specific ionization of charged particles , a ring imaging cherenkov detector to aid particle identification , and a csi calorimeter for detection of electromagnetic showers .",
    "these components are immersed in a magnetic field of 1  t , provided by a superconducting solenoid , and surrounded by a muon detector .",
    "the cleo - c detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we reconstruct the @xmath13 decay using three tracks measured in the tracking system . charged tracks satisfy standard goodness of fit quality requirements  @xcite .",
    "pion and kaon candidates are required to have specific ionization , @xmath22 , in the main drift chamber within four standard deviations of the expected value at the measured momentum .",
    "we use two kinematic variables to select @xmath13 decays , the candidate invariant mass @xmath23 and the beam constrained mass @xmath24 where @xmath25=1968.2  mev/@xmath26  @xcite is the @xmath14 mass , @xmath27 is the beam energy , @xmath28 is the momentum of reconstructed @xmath29 candidate , and @xmath30 = 2040.25  mev/@xmath26 is the expected @xmath31 value of the @xmath14 meson in the process @xmath32 at @xmath33  mev .",
    "we require @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where the resolutions @xmath36  mev/@xmath26 ( 4.79@xmath370.05  mev/@xmath26 in single gaussian fit ) , and @xmath38  mev/@xmath26 ( 1.89@xmath370.02  mev/@xmath26 ) represent the widths of the signal peak in the two dimensional distribution . when there are multiple @xmath14-meson candidates in a single event we select the one with smallest @xmath39 value .",
    "we use a kinematic fit to all 3-track combinations which enforces a common vertex and @xmath29 mass constraint .",
    "the kinematic fit - corrected 4-momenta of all 3 particles are used to calculate invariant masses for further dalitz plot analysis .",
    "the resolution on the resonance invariant mass is almost always better than 5  mev/@xmath26 .",
    "after all requirements , we select 14400 candidate events for the dalitz plot analysis . the fraction of background , 15.1% , in this sample is estimated from the fits to the @xmath40 spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : selection_2 ] .     the @xmath41 distribution .",
    "the vertical ( online blue ) lines show the @xmath42 signal region.,width=604 ]    in most fits to the dalitz plot we constrain the value of the signal fraction , @xmath43% . in cross checks we use a set of sub - samples , splitting the data by time of observation and by sign of @xmath14-meson charge , @xmath29 and @xmath44 .",
    "we also consider samples with tight ( @xmath45 standard deviations in @xmath31 and @xmath40 ) and loose ( @xmath46 three standard deviations ) selection versus the standard selection , as well as samples of @xmath14 mesons produced in @xmath47 decays , selected with a displaced signal box using @xmath31 low band ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath31 high band ( @xmath49 ) .    to determine the efficiency we use a signal monte - carlo ( mc ) @xcite simulation where one of the charged @xmath14 mesons decays in the @xmath50 mode uniformly in the phase space , while the other @xmath14 meson decays in all known modes with relevant branching fractions .",
    "in total we generated @xmath51 @xmath29 and @xmath44 signal decays .",
    "these underlying events are input to the cleo - c detector simulation and processed with the cleo - c reconstruction package .",
    "the mc - generated events are required to pass the same selection requirements as data selected in the signal box .",
    "we only select the signal - side @xmath14 mesons which decay uniformly in the phase space , separating them by charge .",
    "we analyze events on the dalitz plot by choosing @xmath52 and @xmath53 as the independent ( @xmath54 ) variables .",
    "the third variable @xmath55 is dependent on @xmath56 and @xmath57 through energy and momentum conservation .",
    "we do not expect any resonant sub - structure in the @xmath58 invariant mass ; with these dalitz plot variables any structure in @xmath59 is due to reflections of structures in @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dp_data ] shows the dalitz plot .",
    "the dalitz plot for the data.,width=604 ]    besides the clear @xmath17 and @xmath60 signal , no other narrow features are clearly observed .",
    "the variation of the population density along the resonance band clearly indicates that these resonances are spin one as the amplitude for a spin - one resonance should have a node in the middle of its band .",
    "there is a significant population density in the node region of the @xmath17 resonance , indicating that there is likely to be an additional contribution .",
    "the simulated signal sample is used to determine the efficiency .",

    "we perform a dalitz plot analysis of the @xmath0 decay with the cleo - c data set of 586  pb@xmath1 of @xmath2 collisions accumulated at @xmath3  gev .",
    "this corresponds to about 0.57 million @xmath86 pairs from which we select 14400 candidate events with a background of 15% .",
    "we compare our results with the previous measurement from e687 using the isobar model and find good agreement with the e687 parameters , as shown in table  [ tab : comp_e687 ] .",
    "we find that all resonances from e687 model are significant and their exclusion degrades the fit quality .    however , the fit quality is signficantly improved if we add an additional @xmath87 resonance to the model . as shown in tables  [",
    "tab : add_kpi_resonance ] and [ tab : add_kk_resonance ] , almost any additional resonance or non - resonant contribution improves the agreement with the data .",
    "the best improvement is achieved if we add an @xmath5 contribution .",
    "we find that a six - resonance model , containing contributions from @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 , and @xmath10 resonances , gives better consistency with our data with @xmath88 .",
    "tables  [ tab : add_kpi_to_modela ] and [ tab : add_kk_to_modela ] show that any further additional resonance does not have a significant amplitude , fit fraction , or significantly improve the fit quality and we give upper limits on their fit fractions at the 90% c.l .    in table",
    "[ tab : resonance_parameters ] we show the resonance parameters when they are allowed to float in the fit . we find that the @xmath60 width is 5  mev/@xmath26 smaller than in pdg .",
    "this result is consistent with our observation in the @xmath89 analysis  @xcite .",
    "other resonance parameters are consistent with their values from the pdg  @xcite or the bes experiment  @xcite for @xmath90 .",
    "we estimate a systematic uncertainty on fit parameters from numerous fit variations , and table  [ tab : summary ] shows the final results on fit parameters with their statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
