    "1996 , 1998 ; bker , frster - schreiber , & genzel 1997 ; vanzi et al .",
    "this transition occurs because the hot , ionizing stars in a starburst stellar population have lifetimes of only a few million years , while supernovae are produced by stars that are of relatively low mass and are only relatively weak uv emitters ( see , e.g. , the starburst models of leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .    we propose that traditional weak-[oi ] liners and hii / liners arise as the episode of star formation ages and the snrs start making an important contribution to the observed flux of the [ feii ] lines , as well as to the low - ionization optical emission lines . the [ feii]@xmath34m / pa@xmath4 line ratio will rise as the number of snr increases and the ionization flux from very young stars decreases ( and therefore the pa@xmath4 flux ) .",

    ", it provides a very plausible fit to the line ratios in most of the weak-[oi]6300 and some classical liners .",
    "a separate set of calculations confirms that we can account for the line ratios in many of these galaxies with very hot ( t @xmath230 45,000k ) stars as was pointed out by filippenko & terlevich ( 1992 ) .",
    "thus , neither set of fits is unique for starburst - dominated liners , and the choice between them depends on other evidence . in this regard ,",
    "the upper limits of 40,000k for the stellar temperature we have set for ngc  3504 and ngc  3367 would indicate that the new class of fit is to be preferred .",
    "second , the high - stellar - temperature models have trouble reproducing cases with strong [ oiii ] as well as low - ionization lines , such as those toward the upper right in figure  8 .",
    "very hot stars appear to dominate starbursts for very short times .",
    "therefore , we believe that the success of the lower temperature / shock excitation model is strong evidence that many liners are aging starbursts , in which the snrs play an increasingly important role as the starburst ages .",
    "not all the liners studied in this paper fall into either of these categories though .",
    "ngc  2639 , ngc  1052 , ngc  3031 , ngc  3998 , ngc  4579 and ngc",
    "7743 have optical line ratios which are not easily modeled with the composite hii region  snr model .",
    "although we do not rule out the possibility that star formation is playing some role , it seems that in this group of objects the low - luminosity agn is dominant .",
    "we can explore the liner - starburst connection through a simple parametarization of the behavior of a starburst galaxy .",
    "we take a typical mass - luminosity relation :    @xmath231    where @xmath232 is the stellar mass and @xmath233 its luminosity ( and @xmath25 a constant ) .",
    "@xmath8 is @xmath234 for stars with @xmath235m@xmath236 ( vacca , garmany , & shull 1996 ) .",
    "we approximate the main sequence lifetime of a star as ,    @xmath237    now we assume a starburst in which all stars are formed simultaneously .",
    "it can then be shown that the mass at the main sequence turnoff as a function of the starburst age ( @xmath238 ) is approximately :    @xmath239    where @xmath240 is a constant .",
    "we take the initial mass function imf ( for high mass stars ) in the starburst to be ( with upper mass cutoff @xmath241 ) :    @xmath242    where @xmath243 is a constant . with these approximations , the supernova rate ( snr )",
    "can be computed as ,    @xmath244    using a similar approach , the starburst luminosity is :    @xmath245    we have made the approximation that all the luminosity emerges from stars near the main sequence turnoff ( @xmath246 ) in simplifying the integral .",
    "additional luminosity is produced by stars in post - main - sequence evolution , but it would correct the expression by only a small factor , and since these stages are predominantly at much lower stellar temperature than the main sequence ones , much of this luminosity may escape the starburst region .",
    "thus , from equations  [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] we get that the starburst luminosity to supernova rate ratio does not depend upon the imf slope , and using the nominal value of @xmath8 goes as ,    @xmath247    that is , so long as the main sequence turnoff is high enough that virtually all evolving stars end their lives as supernovae ( nominally corresponding to a turnoff mass near 8m@xmath236 ) , then the proportionality between luminosity and supernova rate should change only slightly as the starburst ages .",
    "however , because starburst galaxies are usually identified by their emission lines , it would be more appropriate to use the ionizing luminosity to represent the starburst phase .",
    "the ionizing luminosity can be expressed as @xmath248 , and in this case , equation  [ 7 ] becomes ,    @xmath249    the value of @xmath4 is approximately 7 for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 32,000k and 40,000k ( vacca et al .",
    "1996 ) , so the time dependence is :    @xmath250    the analytical prediction given in equation  ( 9 ) is in good agreement with the model prediction ( figure  7 ) in which the line ratio [ feii]@xmath92m / br@xmath149 drops by more than a factor of a hundred between 1 and 10myr .",
    "thus , the nature of the emission spectrum of a galaxy will change rather abruptly from hii - dominated to shock - dominated ( equation  9 ) .",
    "this transition will occur while there is still a substantial luminosity from the starburst ( equation  7 ) .",
    "we therefore predict that there will be two general classes of luminous starburst - powered galaxy , dominated respectively by hot stellar and shock excitation .",
    "intermediate cases will arise largely because extended periods of star formation can cause parts of the starburst to be in a young phase while other parts have evolved into the shock - excited phase .      to test these predictions",
    ", we need to determine when the supernova rate is high enough ( compared with the luminosity of the starburst ) that we will start detecting liner characteristics .",
    "pure starbursts could be defined such that the ratio of ionizing radiation to supernova shock - heating is greater than 1 . from figure  7 , for a burst of 1myr duration ( fwhm ) , the transition occurs after about 6myr , as defined by when the ratio of the predominantly shock excited [ feii ] to the predominantly photo - ionized br@xmath149 lines exceeds one . in fitting starbursts with evolutionary models , it is generally found that strong star formation occurs over a period of @xmath251myr ( e.g. , rieke et al .",
