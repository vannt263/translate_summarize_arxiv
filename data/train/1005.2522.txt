    "originally suggested  @xcite as descriptive of adsorption of molecules on a substrate ( a motivation that has been renewed in recent experiments  @xcite ) , dimer models have attracted the interest of researchers in various branches of physics , ranging from statistical and condensed matter physics to high - energy physics  @xcite .",
    "their distinctive properties essentially result from the close - packing condition , which imposes that on a lattice , each site should be part of one and only one dimer .",
    "this strict condition generates strong correlations between degrees of freedom , even when interactions are absent from the system .",
    "classical dimer models have been originally studied in statistical mechanics , with the famous result that non - interacting dimer models on planar graphs can be solved exactly using pfaffians  @xcite . on the square lattice for instance ,",
    "it was shown using subsequent techniques that dimer correlation functions decay algebraically with distance  @xcite .",
    "it was latter shown that dimer models can also be viewed as dual versions of ising models  @xcite and generate the ground - state manifolds of fully frustrated ising models  @xcite .",
    "for bipartite lattices in three dimensions , dimers can be represented by an effective magnetic field living on the bonds of the lattice .",
    "the close - packing condition for the dimers encodes a gauss law for the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "postulating a quadratic dependence on this field of the effective entropic action suggests the existence of _ dipolar _ dimer - dimer correlations .",
    "monte carlo simulations  @xcite indeed confirm this picture with a great accuracy , and the corresponding phase of dimers on 3d bipartite lattice is often referred to as a coulomb phase  @xcite with this electromagnetic analogy in mind .",
    "in some sense , dimer models form the  ising model \" of local constraint , spelling out their ubiquity in physics . in condensed - matter ,",
    "dimer models emerged as classical counterparts of quantum dimer models  @xcite ( which properties for particular values of parameters are determined by those of the classical problem ) , as well as effective models for magnetization plateaus in frustrated magnets  @xcite .",
    "dimer models show also close similarities with spin - ice systems  @xcite which can also host a coulomb phase . there",
    "the close - packing condition translates into the `` ice rule '' .",
    "intriguing physics take place in classical dimer models when interactions are present . the perhaps simplest case to study",
    "is to add local interactions which favor parallel alignment of dimers on a plaquette of the lattice . in two dimensions on bipartite lattices , the system undergoes a phase transition from a columnar phase at low temperature to a disordered critical phase at high temperature  @xcite .",
    "the transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "it is possible to obtain a field theoretical description of the transition in terms of an height model which predicts accurately the behavior of the correlation functions of different observables  @xcite .",
    "the situation is much less clear in three dimensions . at high temperature on the cubic lattice ,",
    "the system is located in the coulomb phase which is destabilized as the temperature is lowered towards a columnar order of dimers . quite surprisingly , the transition between the critical coulomb phase and the ordered phase is _ continuous _  @xcite .",
    "critical exponents estimated from the numerical simulations do not appear to be those of a known `` simple '' universality class , although being very close to those of a tricritical theory .",
    "a field theoretical description of the transition observed in the @xmath2 classical dimer model is not easy .",
    "in particular , it can not be properly addressed in the traditional ginzburg - landau formalism since the correlations between degrees of freedom in the disordered phase decay algebraically and not exponentially .",
    "different attempts to provide for a field theoretical description of the critical point have led to a representation in the continuum in terms of two complex matter fields coupled to a non compact @xmath3 gauge field  @xcite , a theory known as the non compact @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) theory .",
    "the problem is that it is not clear at present if this theory possesses in fact an infra - red fixed point .",
    "efforts to simulate lattice versions of the @xmath5 model either lead to a weakly first - order transition  @xcite , or to a continuous transition with unconventional critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "of course , it is possible that the @xmath5 theory possesses a tricritical point and that the different simulated microscopic models all correspond to the same theory but flow in the continuum toward different parameter regimes .",
    "another possibility is that the microscopic dimer model of ref",
    ".   sits at a tricritical point , which would be the essentially unique way of reconciling the observed continuous transition with a ginzburg - landau approach based on symmetry - breaking .",
    "note that the value of the critical exponents @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite are suggestive of this scenario as they are close to the ones of a @xmath0 tricritical theory",
    ". this putative tricritical point could be the one of the @xmath5 theory , or of another field theory yet to be specified .",
    "it is however unclear why the dimer model should be precisely located at a tricritical point : this usually requires a fine - tuning of parameters , and there is no other parameter than temperature in the original microscopic model  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we step aside from field theoretical considerations and instead provide new valuable data regarding the critical behavior of 3d classical dimer models . we have carried an extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of a dimer model consisting of a four - dimers interaction on a cubic lattice , in addition to the usual attractive two - dimers plaquette interactions .",
    "the cubic interaction corresponds to a coupling between four parallel dimers sitting on the edges of a cube which can be attractive ( non frustrated regime ) or repulsive ( frustrated regime ) .",
    "the system is studied with a worm mc algorithm which allows us to sample systems of linear size up to @xmath9 .",
    "our results suggest that the phase transition between coulomb and columnar phases is first order almost everywhere in the non frustrated regime , and second order in the frustrated side - forcing the existence of a tricritical point in between these two regimes .",
    "moreover , we find that the critical exponents in the strongly frustrated regime are different from the ones measured in the absence of the cubic interaction , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in order to rule out a very weak first order transition for all the range of parameters ( which is always possible )",
    ", we performed a flowgram analysis which clearly indicates two collapses above and below the tricritical point .",
    "finally , at very low temperature in the strongly frustrated regime , we observe a new crystalline phase resulting from the destabilization of the columnar phase .",
    "this phase has a degeneracy growing extensively with the linear system size and is separated from the columnar phase by a first order transition . the final phase diagram that we obtain",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "we note that similar results were recently obtained by papanikolaou and betouras  @xcite in a different deformation of the dimer model .",

    "the partition function reads : @xmath15 and the energy of an allowed configuration @xmath14 is given by : @xmath16 where the first term is proportional to the number of plaquettes in the configuration containing two parallel dimers ( referred in the following as `` parallel plaquettes '' ) and the second counts the number of unit cubes sustaining four parallel dimers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cubes ] ) .",
    "both occurences of terms in a given dimer configuration are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] . in the remainder of this study",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the case of attractive plaquette interactions @xmath17 while cubic interaction @xmath18 can be attractive or repulsive .",
    "we investigate the properties of the system as a function of the ratio @xmath19 and temperature @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath21 , both interactions have the same sign and the system will be said to be non frustrated , as both interactions favor the same columnar ground - states . on the opposite , when @xmath22 , the system will be in a frustrated regime ( @xmath23 and @xmath18 terms compete ) . in general",
    ", we take @xmath24 and vary @xmath18 .",

    "[ eq : model ] : interacting plaquettes ( top ) and cube ( bottom ) are represented with shaded surfaces . ]    we simulate the dimer model by means of a worm monte carlo algorithm with a local heat - bath detailed balance condition  @xcite .",
    "compared to a local metropolis algorithm , autocorrelation times are drastically reduced with a worm algorithm due to the use of non - local moves , which allows us to reach systems of linear size up to @xmath9 . as we will see in the next section , the ability to simulate very large system sizes is of crucial importance to distinguish between continuous and weakly first - order transitions .",
    "we would indeed like to emphasize that for systems like dimer models , or others which contain _ a priori _ long - range correlations , one should be particularly cautious regarding the issue of finite - size scaling . here , for the largest system sizes , up to @xmath29 sweeps",
    "have been carried ( we define one sweep by performing enough worm moves such that on average every site of the lattice is visited ) .",
    "the convergence of simulations is checked by looking at autocorrelation times of the various observables , as obtained from a binning analysis .",
    "the observables in our system are of three kinds : a first group is made of the thermodynamic quantities such as the average energy , a second type of observables is related to the columnar ordering , and the third type is related to the stiffness of the system ( fluctuations of dimer fluxes ) .",
    "a phase transition can generally be detected by monitoring the probability distribution of the energy of the system .",
    "for a first order transition , the average energy @xmath30 is discontinuous and exhibits a latent heat when the temperature is lowered . for a second order transition ,",
    "the average energy is continuous but its first derivative , the specific heat per site @xmath31 , obeys the scaling law : @xmath32 the first term @xmath33 , corresponding to the regular part of the specific heat at criticality , is often forgotten in fits of numerical data as the divergence of the second term usually dominates ( for @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , at several points of the phase diagram , we find that this term can not be neglected as the divergence of the specific heat can turn quite slow . in this situation",
    ", one can take @xmath33 as either a new fitting parameter or as given by results obtained on small systems where the second term is negligible . in these cases ,",
    "we take a conservative approach for the error bar on @xmath35 and quote a result which encloses all possibilities .    in comparison , for a first order transition , the specific heat diverges like the volume : @xmath36 .",
    "finally , another mean to distinguish between first and second order transitions is to consider the whole histogram of energy at the transition temperature , as obtained in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "we expect for a first order phase transition the appearance of double peaks , centered at the average energy of the two co - existing phases .",
    "these peaks will appear only for samples with size above ( or close to ) the correlation lenght at the transition , and should keep being separated when increasing system size .",
    "for a second order phase transition , the histogram should contain a unique peak .",
    "the local columnar order parameter @xmath37 is defined with respect to the dimer occupation number at each site @xmath38 : @xmath39 the global order parameter reads @xmath40 and is normalized such that the six columnar states correspond to : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "one also considers the corresponding susceptibility @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , for a second order transition : @xmath44 while for a first order transition @xmath45 . finally , the binder cumulant : @xmath46 is a scale - invariant quantity in the case of a continuous transition , and should thus exhibit a crossing point at criticality as a function of the system size .",
    "moreover , the finite size - scaling ( fss ) of its derivative with respect to the temperature : @xmath47 gives a direct access to the critical exponent @xmath48 .      the ( inverse ) stiffness encodes fluctuations of dimer fluxes across a plane  @xcite : @xmath49 where the flux @xmath50 is the algebraic number of dimers crossing a plane perpendicular to the unit vector @xmath51 . given a lattice direction ,",
    "the contribution to the flux is @xmath52 for a dimer going from one sublattice to the other and @xmath53 for the reverse situation . the stiffness is finite in the coulomb phase , reflecting the presence of dipolar correlations between dimers . on the other hand ,",
    "the columnar phase is robust to insertion of fluxes and @xmath54 vanishes exponentially with system size . at a second order phase transition",
    ", the quantity @xmath55 should be scale invariant  @xcite and the scaling of its derivative : @xmath56 provides another access from the high temperature side to the exponent @xmath48 .",
    "in general , the error bars that we quote on exponents include at the same time errors due to the fitting procedure ( which we measure by considering stability of fits with exclusion of a few data points ) , errors from the determination of critical temperature as well as statistical errors .",
    "we start the discussions of our numerical results on the non - frustrated side @xmath57 and @xmath17 of the phase diagram . when both interactions are attractive , we expect to find the same phases as in the simple attractive plaquette model : a six - fold degenerate columnar phase at low temperature and a coulomb phase with dipolar correlations at high temperature .    at first , let us consider the extreme case where only attractive cubic interactions are present ( @xmath58 or @xmath59 in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the energy , columnar order parameter @xmath60 and inverse stiffness @xmath54 for small system sizes is presented on figure [ fig : extremenf ] . as expected , the columnar order is non - zero only at low temperature where the inverse stiffness vanishes . but in constrast with the attractive plaquette model , both quantities exhibit a strong discontinuity at the transition temperature @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , the energy also displays such a jump , characteristic of a latent heat .",
    "this shows undoubtedly a first order transition .     and inverse stiffness @xmath54 as a function of temperature for @xmath58 and @xmath62 .",
    "right : temperature dependence of the average energy per site @xmath63 .",
    "here l = 16.,width=264 ]    to settle definitively the nature of the transition as well as to benchmark the method , we also study the histogram of energy observed during the simulation , which corresponds to the probability distribution of the energy @xmath64 .",
    "the appearance of a double peak distribution at the critical temperature is a typical sign of a first order transition . for @xmath65",
    ", we can easily detect this double peak for system sizes as small as @xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histos ] ) .",
    "we now introduce a small attractive plaquette interaction @xmath23 and repeat the procedure by tracking the temperature at which columnar order sets in and inverse stiffness vanishes .",
    "we observe that the nature of the transition remains discontinuous but that the correlation length grows as the ratio @xmath67 is decreased : for @xmath68 we find double peaks only at sizes @xmath69 , for @xmath70 at sizes @xmath71 and for @xmath72 at @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histos ] ) .",

    "moreover , in the non frustrated regime , we have seen in section [ sec : nonfrustrated ] that the transition between coulomb and columnar phases is clearly first order , at least when @xmath103 .",
    "a natural interpretation of these data is that there is a tricritical point for a value @xmath104 in the vicinity of @xmath102 , separating a continuous transition in the frustrated case to a discontinuous one in the non - frustrated case .",
    "the presence of a tricritical point can influence the effective critical exponents measured for values of @xmath67 in the vicinity of @xmath105 . despite the large samples used in our simulations , we are not able to precise the exact location of this tricritical point . in particular , there is no formal reason to believe that the tricritical point is located exactly at @xmath102 . in the next section",
    ", we will show that the tricritical point should at least be located on the non frustrated side , that is @xmath106 .    another possible explanation that we can not exclude _",
    "a priori _ is that the transition is always first order .",
    "in fact , by looking at the evolution of the different exponents from the non frustrated to the frustrated side , one can perfectly imagine that the correlation length grows continuously but remains _ finite _ at any @xmath67 .",
    "that would mean in particular , that the exponents found in ref .   for the pure plaquette model",
    "are artifacts caused by a very weakly first order transition .",
    "there are several examples of models where reports of unconventional continuous phase transitions have been made and which were finally found to be weakly first order . in order to rule out this scenario , we present in the next section a flowgram analysis combined with a study of histograms at very large system sizes .",

    "( i ) _ introduce a definition of the critical point for finite - size systems consistent with the thermodynamic limit and which is insensitive to the transition order and _ ( ii ) _ compute a quantity @xmath107 which is scale invariant at criticality , vanishes in one phase and diverges in the other . to define the operational critical temperature",

    "we then consider @xmath111 , as this product is indeed scale invariant for a second order transition , vanishes in the columnar phase ( as we expect @xmath54 to vanish exponentally with system size ) there and diverges in the coulomb phase ( as @xmath54 is a constant ) .",

    "the second group of flows is thus associated with the strongly discontinuous transition . at this stage",
    "we can not draw any conclusion about the first group of curves since it might be that all curves diverge and are actually connected by a scaling transformation . by this , we mean that we need to check if there exists no renormalization fonction @xmath116 such that plotted as a function of the renormalized length : @xmath117 all the different flows collapse into a single master curve : @xmath118 to search for such a transformation , we first try to collapse the flows two by two , starting from the largest positive values of @xmath67 . fixing @xmath119",
    ", we find the best numerical value for @xmath120 such that the corresponding flows collapse as a function of @xmath121 .",
    "we then proceed successively with the next two consecutive values of @xmath67 and find the best factor for @xmath122 . in this manner",
    ", we go through all the parameter space , trying to collapse the curves two by two and finding the corresponding @xmath116 , down to @xmath123 .",
    "if such an action is possible , and if the estimated function @xmath124 varies monotonically as a function of @xmath67 , then all the critical points in the interval @xmath113 $ ] should refer to the same critical behavior .",
    "we have searched for such a scaling function @xmath124 and we have arrived to the unambiguous conclusion that it is _ not possible _ to perform a global collapse of the flows . in particular , the slow divergence of the flow for @xmath125 is not compatible with the strong growth shown by the flows around @xmath70 .",
    "this is because the flows between these two intervals can hardly be collapsed with their neighbors ( meaning that for any pair of consecutive flows in the interval @xmath126 , we could not find a rescaling factor such that the two flows are superimposed ) . on the contrary ,",
    "we have succeeded in performing two local collapses : one for the region @xmath127 , and the other for the region @xmath128 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flowgram ] bottom ) .",
    "this is a clear indication of the presence of two different critical behaviors in the phase diagram . because the collapse for positive @xmath80 is strongly diverging , we naturally associate it with a first order transition .",
    "the collapse in the negative range of @xmath67 describes most probably a second order regime .",
    "one can see that this collapse has actually not converged , as it should for a continuous transition .",
    "this is partly due to our original choice of the constant @xmath109 which made our operational critical temperature slightly above the real @xmath129 .",
    "a small amount of non - zero stiffness remains present in the system and perturbs the convergence towards the fixed point behavior .         to further confirm our conclusion on the flowgram",
    ", we have performed the following check .",
    "suppose that the points @xmath125 and @xmath70 refer nevertheless to the same critical regime .",
    "then , there should exist a scaling function connecting the flows at @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "it is in fact possible to connect _ very roughly _ the two flows by renormalizing the length @xmath12 for @xmath70 by a factor @xmath132 while leaving the flow for @xmath125 unchanged ( see fig .",

    "if this rescaling is really a physical renormalization transformation , then the properties of the system at @xmath125 and @xmath133 should correspond to those at @xmath70 and @xmath134 .",
    "for this latest value , we know in particular that the transition is first order since the energy histogram displays a double peak ( see fig .  [ fig : histos ] ) .",
    "if the critical point @xmath135 is indeed in the same regime as the critical point at @xmath136 , we should expect to see a double - peak also for samples of sizes @xmath137 at @xmath135 .",
    "we have therefore carried a simulation at @xmath102 with @xmath9 and have then measured the histogram of energy at the maximum of the specific heat .",

    "[ fig : histo180 ] bottom right ) , which confirms that the transition at @xmath135 is continuous .",

    "in this study , we presented an extended version of the classical dimer model with plaquettes and cubic interactions .",
    "our simulations indicate that depending on the sign of the interactions , the nature of the critical phase transition between the coulomb and columnar phases changes . compared to the pure plaquette model ( @xmath74 ) , a cubic interaction which reinforces the alinement of dimers ( @xmath141 ) leads to a first order transition , identified by a double peak distribution of the energy and a strong divergence in thermodynamic quantities . whether an infinitesimal positive cubic coupling is enough to alter the nature of the transition is not certain ,",
    "as we lack any theoretical argument to support this , but simulations tend to indicate that this change should occur very close to @xmath102 . on the other side ,",
    "when both interactions compete ( @xmath140 ) , finite size scaling analysis of thermodynamic quantities shows no sign of any discontinuity at the transition .",
    "when the cubic interaction is largely dominant ( @xmath94 ) , the critical exponents deviate significantly from those measured in the pure plaquette model , with @xmath100 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 in the first case and @xmath143 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the latter . in the interval @xmath144",
    ", we find exponents in between these two cases , probably due to a cross - over effect .",
    "to discharge the possibility of a weak first order transition on the frustrated side , we carried out a flowgram analysis in the vicinity of @xmath102 .",
    "the flowgram clearly demonstrates the presence of two groups of flows , one corresponding to positive values of @xmath67 and the other to negative values .",
    "this rules out the possibility of a connection between the two parts of the phase diagram , and thus reveal the presence of a tricritical point  @xcite .",
    "finally , we also detected the presence of a new crystalline phase at low temperature , deep in the frustrated regime .",
    "this phase is characterized by a degeneracy growing with the system size .    in a parallel work ,",
    "papanikolaou and betouras recently studied another extension of the dimer model that slightly differs from ours but which leads to similar conclusions  @xcite . to perturb the pure plaquette model ,",
    "these authors introduce further neighbor interactions between dimers which preserve the cubic symmetry .",
    "they find that when the extra couplings favor the columnar alinement , the transition becomes first order . on the opposite ,",
    "a frustrating coupling maintains the continuity of the transition .",
    "the critical exponents they measure are in agreement with ours in the limit of large frustration .",
    "our study has the advantage of using much larger samples ( the maximum system size used in ref .   is @xmath145 ) , giving more confidence on the values of exponents .",
    "furthermore , the use of the flowgram analysis provides an explicit evidence for tricriticality . in another related work ,",
    "chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite find that by favoring one particular subset of the 6 columnar orderings at low temperature , the transition between the coulomb and columnar phases becomes either first order or in the @xmath2 @xmath146 universality class .",
    "while not entirely interpretive , it is tempting to compare the exponents on the frustrated side of the dimer model to other models which also display unconventional phase transitions . in ref .",
    ", a lattice gauge theory representing a coarse - grained version of the dimer model was simulated by monte carlo .",
    "there , the exponents were found to be very close to the @xmath2 @xmath146 universality class and thus differ from those presented here .",
    "another source of information is given by the study of the @xmath5 field theory .",
    "there exists several indications that the exponent @xmath91 in the @xmath5 theory should be large and positive  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the transition observed in the ring - exchange models studied in ref .",
    "provide an estimate of @xmath147 ( depending on which correlation function is looked at ) and @xmath148 .",
    "these values are not far from those we observed in the strong frustration regime .",
    "on the other hand , direct simulations of lattice versions of the @xmath5 all exhibit a first order transition  @xcite .",
    "this possibility is ruled out in the dimer model , thanks to our results obtained with the flowgram analysis .",
    "we gratefully thank l. marty for her active participation at an early stage of this work .",
    "we also thank s. trebst for useful discussions . this work was performed using hpc resources from genci - ccrt / idris ( grant 2009 - 100225 ) .",
    "we also thank calmip for allocation of cpu time .",
    "we use the alps libraries  @xcite for the monte carlo simulations .",

    "<S> we present an extensive numerical study of the critical behavior of dimer models in three dimensions , focusing on the phase transition between coulomb and crystalline columnar phases . </S>",
    "<S> the case of attractive interactions between parallel dimers on a plaquette was shown to undergo a continuous phase transition with critical exponents close to those of the @xmath0 _ tricritical _ universality class , a situation which is not easily captured by conventional field theories . </S>",
    "<S> that the dimer model is exactly fine - tuned to a highly symmetric point is a non trivial statement which needs careful numerical investigation . in this paper , we perform an extensive monte carlo study of a generalized dimer model with plaquette and cubic interactions and determine its extended phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when both interactions favor alignment of the dimers , the phase transition is first order , in almost all cases . on the opposite , when interactions compete , the transition becomes continuous , with a critical exponent @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a tricritical point between the two regimes is confirmed by simulations on very large size systems and a flowgram method . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a highly - degenerate crystalline phase at very low temperature in the frustrated regime which is separated from the columnar phase by a first order transition . </S>"
