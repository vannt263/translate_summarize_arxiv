    "supersymmetric ( susy ) so(10 ) model has a number of desirable features that make it an ideal candidate to describe physics beyond the standard model in a grand unified framework .",
    "they are : + ( a ) unification of all fermions of each generation into a single spinor representation@xcite restoring quark - lepton symmetry to weak interactions ; + ( b ) a natural implementation of the see - saw mechanism@xcite for understanding small neutrino masses , which in the minimal version of the model are of the right order of magnitude to explain the solar neutrino puzzle via the msw@xcite mechanism ; + ( c ) a simple mechanism for explaining the origin of matter starting with a zero baryon and lepton asymmetry of the universe for temperature above the grand unification scale@xcite .    in this paper , we wish to discuss a subclass of susy so(10 ) models which have another highly desirable feature : automatic r - parity conservation which leads to natural conservation of baryon and lepton number symmetries prior to symmetry breaking . as is well - known , this property is not present in the susy standard model nor in the susy su(5 ) model@xcite , where extra symmetries have to be imposed by hand to ensure r - parity invariance . on the other hand , in the so(10 ) model if all higgs representations are chosen to have congruence number zero ( such as * 45 * , * 54 * , * 210 * , etc . ) and two ( such as * 10 * , * 120 * , * 126 * , @xmath0 , etc . ) , the r - parity symmetry is automatic .",
    "two possible minimal models with this property are given below : + * * the higgs particles belong to representations \\{*210 * } , \\{*126 * } @xmath1 \\{@xmath0 } and \\{*10*}@xcite .",
    "the role of \\{*210 * } is to break so(10 ) down to su(2)@xmath2 su(2)@xmath3 su(4)@xmath4 ; that of \\{@xmath0 } ( denoted by @xmath5 ) is to break su(2)@xmath3 su(4)@xmath4 down to u(1)@xmath6 su(3)@xmath4 while at the same time giving heavy majorana mass to the right - handed neutrino ( @xmath7 ) to implement the see - saw mechanism for neutrino masses ; the role of \\{*126 * } ( denoted by @xmath8 ) is to cancel the @xmath5 contribution to the d - term so that supersymmetry is maintained down to the weak scale ; the role of \\{*10 * } ( denoted by @xmath9 ) is of course to break the su(2)@xmath2 u(1)@xmath10 to u(1)@xmath11 and generate fermion masses . the model is minimal in the sense that omitting any one of these multiplets will leave extra undesirable local symmetries at low energies or break susy at gut scale .    * * the higgs particles belong to the multiplets \\{*45 * } @xmath1 \\{*54 * } ( denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ) , and \\{*126 * } @xmath1 \\{@xmath0 } @xmath1 \\{*10*}. apart from being more economical compared to model a , this model has another difference from model a. _ i.e. _ , here so(10 ) is broken down to su(2)@xmath2 su(2)@xmath3 u(1)@xmath14 su(3)@xmath4 before breaking to @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in general superstring models , the \\{*126 * } @xmath1 \\{@xmath0 } ( or higher ) so(10 ) representations do not emerge below the planck scale after compactification@xcite",
    ". therefore , several so(10 ) models discussed in the literature @xcite have only \\{*45 * } , \\{*16*@xmath16 + @xmath17 } , and \\{*10 * } , where \\{*45 * } @xmath1 \\{*16*@xmath16 } @xmath1 \\{@xmath17 } are used to break so(10 ) down to the standard model . in these models ,",
    "the vacuum expectation values(vev s ) of \\{*16*@xmath16 } @xmath1 \\{@xmath18 } lead to r - parity breaking terms at low energies .",
    "for instance , a term of the form @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 denotes matter spinor and @xmath21 denotes higgs spinor ) will lead to b - violating terms of the form @xmath22 , which can lead to catastrophic baryon number violation terms was pointed out to r. n. m. by a. farragi ] .",
    "one must invoke additional symmetries to prevent the r - non - invariant terms .",
    "it may very well be that such symmetries emerge from superstring compactification .",
    "but this remains to be demonstrated .",
    "moreover , with the above minimal set , it is impossible to break the so(10 ) symmetry down to the standard model without including large planck scale induced non - renormalizable terms in the superpotential .",
    "let us now discuss the question of fermion masses in the r - parity conserving so(10 ) models .",
    "it is well known@xcite that if only a complex * 10 * higgs representation contributes to fermion masses , then one gets the undesirable mass relations between leptons and quarks e.g. @xmath23 , which is a factor of 10 off compared to observations .",
    "one way to correct it is to have the higgs doublets contained in the @xmath24 contribute to the fermion masses through their direct dimension 3 couplings .",
    "however , if we naively added a separate @xmath24 , for this purpose , there would be an extra pair of higgs doublets at low energies which is unacceptable from the point of view of gauge coupling unification@xcite .",
    "moreover , the usual problem of doublet - triplet splitting will also get worse .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is a simple solution to this problem : the same @xmath24 , which contributes to the breaking of @xmath25 symmetry and to the see - saw mechanism , can have its weak doublets acquire an induced vev without leaving any extra light doublet and without any fine tuning provided there is a coupling between the * 10 * and the @xmath24 in the superpotential via other higgs multiplets that only have vev s of order of the gut scale .",
    "( such couplings can arise , for instance , if there is a * 210 * multiplet in the theory . )",
    "the induced vev then will correct the bad charged fermion mass relations .",
    "this property of inducing vev for * ( 2,2,15 ) * of @xmath5 can also be stated in another way .",
    "when so(10 ) breaks down to the standard model at m@xmath26 , there are two light doublets ( say @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) . to obtain realistic quark lepton mass relations",
    ", they must be a linear combination of the doublets in \\{*10 * } and \\{@xmath0}. in the rest of the paper , we will call this ",
    "mixed light higgs property\"(mlhp ) .",
    "it is simple to see that models with mlhp do not have the property of yukawa unification widely discussed in recent literature @xcite but strict yukawa unification is anyway not realistic for the first and second generation .",
    "this property , mlhp does impose non - trivial constraints on model building .",
    "for instance , maintaining mlhp while implementing the doublet - triplet splitting ( dts ) is rather nontrivial in general . in the dimopoulos - wilczek scheme@xcite for dts ,",
    "an example was constructed@xcite , where this property emerges consistent with some discrete symmetries .",
    "in fact , it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that any new dts scheme must have this property . in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate a simple so(10 ) model which has this good light higgs property and study the consequences of this general class of so(10 ) models with the additional minimality criterion .",
    "this paper has been organized as follows : in sec .  2 , we argue in favour of the necessity of the mlhp in r - conserving so(10 ) models ; in sec .  3",
    ", we discuss the superpotential of the model b and introduce the doublet - triplet splitting mechanism with mlhp ; in sec .  4 , we study the quark and lepton mass matrices and discuss its implications for neutrino masses and mixings ; in sec .  5",
    ", we discuss the implications for proton decay ; sec .",
    "6 is devoted to an r - conserving so(10 ) model where the higgsino mediated contributions to proton decay is naturally suppressed while maintaining mlhp ; in sec .  7 , we summarize our results and conclude ; in an appendix , we discuss the minimum of the higgs potential consistent with the desired symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "in this section , we explore to what extent , it is an absolute necessity to have mixed light higgs doublets in an automatically r - parity conserving so(10 ) model . _",
    "i.e. _ , could the light higgs below gut scale be purely light higgs ( plh ) arising solely from the complex \\{*10 * }  ?",
    "it is obvious that if non - renormalizable planck induced terms are not included in the superpotential , then plh scheme will not work since it will lead to the bad fermion mass relation @xmath29 already mentioned .",
    "however , once the non - renormalizable planck induced terms are included , the result is not obvious . to see what happens ,",
    "let us assume first that the so(10 ) is broken down to the standard model by \\{*210 * } higgs , via vev s for the components ( * 1,1,1 * ) @xmath1 ( * 1,1,15 * ) @xmath1 ( * 1,3,15 * ) .",
    "the possible non - renormalizable terms involving the matter superfields are of the form : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , etc .",
    "it is then easy to verify that fermion mass matrices will have the general form : @xmath32 here , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are of order @xmath36 ; @xmath33 is symmetric coming from an effective @xmath0 operator ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are antisymmetric coming from effective * 120 * operators .",
    "one then has the relation @xmath37 taking trace of both sides of this equation , we get @xmath38 or zero .",
    "the right hand side of eq.2 is completely determined by the known values of the quark masses and ckm angles .",
    "these values have to be extrapolated to the gut scale in order to test the sumrule in eq.2 .",
    "the details of this extrapolation procedure is described in sec.4 and is applied to the model b. here we use those extrapolated values of the parameters to study the validity of eq.2 .",
    "we find that generically , the electron mass comes out a factor of five or so too large compared to the observed value with no free parameter left to adjust.the muon mass is also in disagreement with the known value by about a factor of 1.5 .",
    "therefore , we feel that it is highly unlikely that a pure light higgs possibility in the sense defined in this paper would be realistic .    similar arguments apply if the gut symmetry is broken by a combination of \\{*45 * } @xmath1 \\{*54*}. thus , we feel that the mixed light higgs doublet property provides a better chance to get a realistic fermion spectrum in a minimal r - conserving so(10 ) model . in the next section ,",
    "we give an example of an explicit model where mlhp is realized and proceed to discuss its implications in subsequent sections .",
    "in this section , we present a simple minimal so(10 ) model , where the light higgs doublets have the desirable property ( mlhp ) described in the introduction . as already mentioned , the key step is to have a term in the superpotential that couples the * 10 * higgs with the @xmath24 higg(s ) via higgs fields that have vev s of order of the gut scale .",
    "if we do not allow for planck scale induced non - renormalizable terms , then we need a * 210 * higgs to achieve this goal ; but as shown in@xcite , achieving this together with doublet - triplet splitting is not very simple , although we did manage to construct an example which is technically natural . in this paper",
    ", we will take the point of view that one should include non - renormalizable planck scale induced terms and we will keep only the lowest order planck induced terms . as we will see this allows for the construction of a rather simple model with mlhp .    as usual , we assign the fermions to the 16-dimensional spinor representation of so(10 ) .",
    "we denote them by @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 stands for generations ) and we use the following set of higgs bosons needed for complete symmetry breaking : + ( i ) \\{*45 * } @xmath1 \\{@xmath41 } ( denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ) to break so(10 ) down to the left - right symmetric group su(2)@xmath2 su(2)@xmath3 u(1)@xmath14 su(3)@xmath4 ; + ( ii ) \\{*126 * } @xmath1 \\{@xmath0 } to break the su(2)@xmath2 u(1)@xmath42 symmetry down to u(1)@xmath10 while keeping supersymmetry in fact down to the m@xmath43 scale ; + ( iii ) a single \\{*10 * } ( denoted by @xmath9 ) to break the su(2)@xmath2 u(1)@xmath10 down to u(1)@xmath11 .",
    "the superpotential of the model is chosen to consist of the following parts : @xmath44 where @xmath45    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , if we show that the light doublets in the model are linear combinations of the doublets in \\{*10 * } and \\{@xmath0 } multiplets , then @xmath46 can accommodate a realistic charged fermion spectrum for all generations .",
    "this is , of course , intimately connected with the question of the doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "it is easy to see ( see appendix ) , using the above superpotential , that the vanishing of f - terms at the scale m@xmath26 and @xmath47 ( which are equal to fit low energy lep data@xcite ) , is guaranteed by the following choice of vev s for the higgs fields @xmath13 , @xmath12 , @xmath8 , and @xmath5 :    @xmath48    using this , we find that the mass matrix for the fermionic doublets in @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and @xmath5 can be written as : @xmath49 where we have fine tuned @xmath50 ( assumed to be zero in writing eq .",

    "it is important to note that in general @xmath63 .",
    "we find this to be a rather simple way to get the light doublets with the correct group theoretical property at low energies , for fermion masses .",
    "furthermore , we expect @xmath64 and @xmath65 to be much smaller than one so that the departure from strict yukawa unification @xciteis small .",

    "the primed symbols represent non - zero group theoretical factors and @xmath68 are proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "it is certain that all eigenvalues are of order @xmath70 .",
    "this solves the doublet - triplet splitting problem .",
    "we want to point out that the specific form of the superpotential @xmath71 can be derived by requiring invariance under a @xmath72 symmetry , under which @xmath13 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 are even and @xmath12 , @xmath5 are odd .",
    "this symmetry for instance forbids the @xmath73 term . coming to the matter part of the superpotential , @xmath46 ,",
    "the @xmath74 term is forbidden but there is an allowed planck induced term @xmath75 which essentially plays the same role as the second term in @xmath46 . the effective coupling in the mass matrix is then given by @xmath76 .    before turning to a discussion of the fermion masses in the model ,",
    "we wish to emphasize two points : first , in discussing the fermion masses in any r - conserving so(10 ) model , one must first ensure that the light higgs doublets have the correct mlhp property consistent with the doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "the absence of color singlet higgs doublets in * 45 * representation makes our mechanism a good starting point for model building ; secondly , this property of the mixed light higgs doublets is not trivial to ensure while keeping all color triplet higgsinos heavy . for instance , if instead of \\{*45 * } , we used a \\{*210 * } to break so(10 ) , the doublet mass matrix becomes a four - by - four matrix since it includes the ( * 2,2,10 * ) submultiplet of \\{*210 * } and several elements in this matrix must be engineered to zero value to attain the mlhp goal@xcite .",
    "of course , one could double the number of \\{*126 * } @xmath1 \\{@xmath0 } multiplets such that one set contributed to the light higgs doublets while the other breaks b - l symmetry and the two remain totally separate .",
    "however , in this case , one must worry about the possibility of unwanted pseudo - goldstone supermultiplets which spoil gauge unification .",
    "let us now turn to the fermion mass matrices in this model .",
    "it was shown that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fermion mass matrices in this model are characterized by 12 parameters , which can all evaluated given the six quark masses , three charged lepton masses and three ckm angles .",
    "the neutrino masses and mixings are then completely predicted .",
    "we repeat this discussion with two differences from ref .",
    "first , we take the effect of the superpartners on the running of the gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "second , we take the effect of the top quark yukawa couplings on the running of the masses@xcite .",
    "we will follow naculich@xcite below .",
    "the low energy superpotential for the model is given by :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are three - by - three matrices expressible in terms of the so(10 ) coupling matrices @xmath81 and @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) as follows : @xmath82    as emphasized earlier @xmath63 is required .",
    "otherwise all ckm angles vanish .",
    "moreover , in a strict supergravity framework , where supersymmetry breaking is implemented in the hidden sector , at @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 . their extrapolation down to the electroweak scale is governed predominantly@xcite by @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "correct symmetry breaking pattern ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath87 ) also requires that @xmath64 and @xmath65 be different from each other .",

    "( [ mudl ] ) , we obtain @xmath185 the first point to note is that since for all our solutions in sec . 4 @xmath94 + @xmath186 to @xmath187 , the proton decay amplitudes receive an extra enhancement factor @xmath188 to 200 ( depending on the cases ) compared to minimal su(5 ) . however , unlike the su(5 ) case , we have two separate contributions to the proton decay amplitude and we could hope to invoke parameters for which there is a cancellation . to see",
    "if this is possible , we choose the special case where @xmath189 . for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath190 we , then , get @xmath191 ( note that one of the triplet pairs completely decouples from the proton decay amplitude . )",
    "we have @xmath192 .",
    "we , thus , have three equations involving the three mixing angles that characterize the matrices @xmath193 and @xmath194 and we could therefore expect a solution for which the proton decay is suppressed .",
    "it must however be pointed out that this does require a fine tuning of parameters .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that the minimal r - parity conserving so(10 ) model of sec . 2 tends to predict higher strengths for the dim .- five proton decay operators compared to minimal susy su(5 ) ; however , unlike the minimal susy su(5 ) model , here there is the possibility of cancellation if one allows fine - tuning among the mixings and masses for the color - triplet higgsinos .",
    "it is , however , worth emphasizing that the predictions for the neutrino sector and realization of realistic quark - lepton masses are logically independent of the proton life - time predictions .",
    "the question , therefore , arises as to whether it is possible to suppress the higgsino - mediated proton decay amplitude while at the same time keeping the discussion of light higgs doublets with correct group theoretical properties to give the mass matrix structure of sec .",
    "4 . a discussion of how to suppress such amplitudes in a different class of so(10 ) models has recently given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we present a different example that has the addition property of  mixed light higgs doublet \" property ( as defined in the introduction ) .",
    "we extend the model by addition of one more higgs in the \\{*10 * } representation ( denoted by @xmath195 ) .",
    "note that automatic r - conservation is maintained in the model .",
    "we choose the superpotential to be @xmath196 we require all @xmath197 and the fine - tuning condition @xmath198 .",
    "it is then clear that the light doublet mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ dm ] ) is preserved .    in table",
    "i , we present a discrete @xmath199 symmetry under which all but dimension two terms are invariant , providing a symmetry basis for this idea . due to the presence of dim",
    ".- two terms , this symmetry is softly broken , which in the supersymmetric context means that even after susy breaking terms are included no hard dim .-",
    "four term would be generated with infinite coefficient that break the symmetry ( thereby helping to maintain our conclusion ) .",
    "this symmetry has the implication that it allows the following matter couplings that will eventually lead to realistic fermion masses and mixings if we assign @xmath200 to be @xmath201 under the symmetry .",
    "@xmath202 where @xmath203 .",
    "the second term leads to both \\{@xmath0 } , \\{*120 * } as well as \\{*10 * } type couplings .",
    "the mass matrices are therefore less predictive than before . +",
    "in summary , we have studied the question of how to get realistic fermion masses in automatically r - parity conserving susy so(10 ) models .",
    "we have argued that an economical way to do this is to have the light higgs doublets contain a piece from the @xmath24 higgs multiplet that is responsible for the breaking of the @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "strict yukawa unification does not hold in these models@xcite .",
    "but , of course , it is well known that models with strict yukawa unification do not address the problem of second and first generation masses .",
    "we have given two examples of such models and studied their predictions for neutrino masses and mixings as well as proton decay .",
    "we find that all the models are testable by the solar neutrino experiments as well as the proposed accelerator experiments . in the proton decay sector",
    ", the situation is less predictive than in the case of the minimal su(5 ) model due to the presence of two different contributions .",
    "we have also given a model in which the higgsino mediated proton decay can indeed be arbitrarily suppressed .",
    "in this appendix , we will discuss the symmetry breaking of the so(10 ) model down to the standard model for the choice of higgs multiplets @xmath13 \\{*54 * } , @xmath12 \\{*45 * } , @xmath8 \\{*126 * } @xmath1 @xmath5 \\{@xmath0}. the relevant part of the superpotential is given by @xmath204 in eq .",
