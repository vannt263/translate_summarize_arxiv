    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can be observed in the spectra of distant quasars through resonant absorption in the hydrogen lyman-@xmath0 transition @xcite .",
    "the absence of strong absorption throughout the spectrum ( gunn - peterson trough ) indicates that the igm is very highly ionised , @xmath5 below redshifts @xmath6 , but the nature of the first ionising sources remains uncertain .",
    "if the sources responsible for reionizing are sufficiently hard , then will be reionized at the same time . however , if for example galaxies were the main contributor to the uv - background , then reionization may be significantly delayed until a population of harder sources appears .",
    "the large fluctuations in the optical depth observed with stis and fuse @xcite suggest reionization occurs late , around @xmath7 .",
    "there is supporting evidence from the hardening of the uv - background , as deduced from metal line ratios although these results remain controversial @xcite .",
    "an independent approach is to study the temperature of the igm .",
    "photo - heating and adiabatic expansion introduce a tight density - temperature relation @xcite , @xmath8 for the low density igm responsible for producing the lyman-@xmath0 forest .",
    "a sudden injection of entropy resulting from reionization will increase @xmath9 and make the gas nearly isothermal , @xmath10 . detecting reionization through a sudden entropy increase",
    "has the advantage that one determines the epoch at which a significant fraction of the volume of the universe is overrun by the ionization front .",
    "schaye et al . used hydrodynamical simulations to demonstrate that the density - temperature relation introduces a cut - off in the scatter plot of column density @xmath11 versus line width @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "they used a set of many high resolution simulations to calibrate the relation between the position of the cut - off and @xmath13 ) . applying the calibration to the cut - off",
    "measured in ten high - resolution spectra , they found evidence for a rise in @xmath9 around a redshift @xmath4 , and an associated dip in @xmath14 , which they associated with reionization .",
    "ricotti , gnedin & shull ( @xcite ) applied a similar technique , but calibrated with pseudo hydrodynamical simulations , to published line lists , and found a similar temperature increase , although their error bars are large and their result is consistent with a non - evolving @xmath9 as well .",
    "bryan & machacek @xcite also found evidence for a high value of @xmath9 , but mcdonald et al .",
    "@xcite did not find an increase in @xmath9 around @xmath15 , although they used largely the same data as schaye et al .",
    "zaldarriage @xcite applied a wavelet analysis similar to the one discussed here to look for temperature changes in the spectrum of qso 1422 + 231 which might be a relic from reionization , and constrained them to be smaller than a factor of 2.5 .",
    "a discrete wavelet is a localised function with a finite bandwidth .",
    "this makes wavelets useful for characterising line widths in a spectrum , since the amplitude of the wavelet will be related to the width of the line , and the position of the wavelet to the position of the line .",
    "the decomposition is moreover unique , for a given wavelet basis .",
    "theuns & zaroubi @xcite used the daubechies 20 wavelet to characterise temperature fluctuations in simulated lyman-@xmath0 spectra .",
    "they demonstrated how the wavelet amplitudes are large when the gas is cold and the lines narrow , and _",
    "vice versa_. they also showed how the cumulative distribution of wavelet amplitudes can be used to characterise the gas temperature , and to judge whether two stretches of spectrum have different temperatures or not . here",
    ", we have used @xmath16 , the maximum difference between the cumulative distribution of a stretch of spectrum , and the distribution for the spectrum as a whole , as a measure of how much @xmath9 for a stretch , differs from @xmath17 .",
    "we have extended this method to attach a statistical significance to differences in cumulative distributions . given a line list ,",
    "we construct mock spectra by scrambling the lines , thereby producing a spectrum where the lines have the _ same shapes _ as in the original spectrum , but any _ correlation _ in line widths that might result from temperature variations along the spectrum has been removed .",
    "we can now attach a statistical level of significance for the correlation between line widths  and hence the temperature of the gas  by comparing the statistics of the original spectrum with the scrambled one .    in our simulation , we chose the photo - ionization rates for hydrogen and helium such that and reionize around redshift @xmath18 but reionization is delayed until @xmath19 . in order to investigate the effect of different temperatures , we impose a power law equation of state , @xmath20 , on the simulation output before computing mock spectra .",
    "we have used @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these spectra are made to look like real data as much as possible , by adding photon and read - out noise , and broadening the lines with the instrumental profile of the spectrograph .",
    "voigt profiles are fitted to the absorption lines with the same programme as used to analyse the data .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ttfig1 ] ) .",
    "the dot  dashed line ( right hand scale ) is the maximum difference between the cumulative distribution of wavelet coefficients for a window of size 8000 km s@xmath2 at redshift @xmath23 , and the spectrum as a whole .",
    "histogram ( left hand scale ) is the significance ( in % ) for unusually large values of @xmath24 , obtained from comparison with spectra constructed from randomised line lists .",
    "negative values indicate gas colder than average , and vice versa for positive values . in the simulated spectrum ( top panel ) , the first and second halves of the spectrum have @xmath25k and @xmath26k respectively .",
    "the wavelet statistic @xmath16 detects this imposed jump , as can be seen from the sudden change in the sign of @xmath16 .",
    "the significance of the change is computed to be @xmath27 per cent .",
    "the bottom panel applies the analysis to the spectrum of qso  0055269 .",
    "we detect a sudden change in the value of @xmath16 around @xmath4 , significant at the @xmath28 per cent .",
    "note that no simulations are used to compute the level of significance : the method described here is solely based on the line list .",
    "we note that the high redshift gas is _ colder _ than the lower redshift gas .",
    "this is opposite to what one would expect from photo - heating in the optically thin limit , in which case the igm will _ smoothly cool down_. therefore we suggest this sudden temperature increase is due to reionization at redshift @xmath29 .",
