    "the stride interval of normal human walking is the time period between consecutive heel strikes of the same foot @xcite . for more than two decades",
    ", a line of research focused on the understanding of the nature of the subtle variations observed in stride intervals and the origin of typical long - range structures in these variations .",
    "today , these investigations are of paramount importance since they could provide a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved in normal human walking and in alterations observed in clinical practice .",
    "the nature of these stride interval variations could arise either from noisy neural processes that result in errors in the motor output or from alterations in the motor command that account for balance instabilities @xcite .",
    "normal gait is characterized by the presence of autocorrelations in the stride interval when considering walking on a sufficiently long time scale @xcite .",
    "the origin of these autocorrelations may be attributed to neural central pattern generators ( cpgs ) @xcite or a super cpg coupled to a forced van der pol oscillator @xcite , and/or to the biomechanics of walking @xcite .",
    "structural irregularities are easily captured by deteriorated autocorrelations and other related indexes .    since the pioneering works of hausdorff et al .",
    "@xcite , long - range autocorrelations in stride intervals are estimated by the so - called hurst or fractal exponent ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "a fractal , introduced in 1975 by the french mathematician benot mandelbrot ( 19242010 ) @xcite , is defined as a geometrical structure that has a regular or an uneven shape repeated over all scales of measurement .",
    "it is characterized by a dimension greater than the spatial dimension of the structure @xcite",
    ". a famous example of such object is a snow flake .",
    "objects that are statistically self - similar  parts of it show the same statistical properties at many scales ",
    "exhibit strong autocorrelation .",
    "the hurst exponent @xmath4 is a statistical measure of long - term memory of time series ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a review ) and is usually associated to fractal - like behaviour . in particular , the peculiar behavior of the stride interval is often referred to as ",
    "fractal behavior \" @xcite .    however , physiological time series might be well autocorrelated without being fractals per se .",
    "the theoretical model of optimal movement complexity @xcite is based on the complementary concepts of _ predictability _ and _ complexity_. a holistic approach to study these mechanisms therefore requires to associate specific measurements to these two concepts .",
    "the hurst exponent @xmath4 captures part of the story and is well suited to reflect predictability .",
    "the minkowski fractal dimension @xmath5 has been shown to provide good measurability the  pparent rugosity \" of fractals @xcite and reflects our second concept , complexity .",
    "this parameter will here complement the quantification of autocorrelation @xmath4 .",
    "a natural question arises as to what is the relation between fractal and human walking ?",
    "because fractal dimension and hurst exponent provide , respectively , a measure of the complexity and irregularity of time series , they were successfully used in various areas including human standing posture @xcite .",
    "previously , autocorrelations in stride interval time series have been identified not only in healthy young adults @xcite but also in children @xcite and elderly @xcite , and even  although significantly modified  in several neurodegenerative conditions .",
    "in particular , the cases of huntington s disease @xcite , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis @xcite , and parkinson s disease have been studied @xcite , with a hope of connecting the observed modifications of fractal behavior to some relevant evaluation of the risk of falling @xcite .    as of today ,",
    "the vast majority of studies explored autocorrelation in the stride interval during forward walking .",
    "in one notable exception however , bollens et al .",
    "@xcite also tested backward walking in a small sample of young healthy subjects .",
    "the authors did not find significant differences in long - range autocorrelation between both walking directions .",
    "a recent literature review pointed out differences in the neural circuitry involved during backward walking compared to forward walking @xcite .",
    "importantly , although less natural , backward walking measures were more sensitive than forward walking measures to classify elderly who are prone to fall from those not prone to fall @xcite .",
    "the study of backward walking under the perspective of fractal analyses is therefore promising to provide more reliable predictive index of subject profiles prone to falls , as previously proposed for forward walking @xcite .",
    "the vestibular system provides an essential sensory contribution to the maintenance of balance during human walking @xcite .",
    "for instance , individuals with vestibular disorders show a decreased walking stability accompanied by an increased risk to fall @xcite and understanding the role played by the vestibular system in the appearance of ac in the stride interval is nowadays necessary . from a clinical point of view , a large number of pathologies of various etiologies are referred to as  vestibular disorders \" , including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo , vestibular neuritis , labyrinthitis , mnire s disease or vestibular problems following surgical procedures such as labyrinthectomy or removal of an acoustic neuroma . therefore",
    ", perturbing the vestibular system of healthy subjects with gvs is advantageous since it is a well controlled stimulation .    until now ,",
    "the effects of gvs were mainly studied during target - directed fw . with vision , gvs had no influence on the walking path of subjects , but without vision it causes subjects to turn from their planned trajectory .",
    "fitzpatrick et al .",
    "@xcite realized measurements during bw with gvs on 2 subjects and observed that they also turned from their trajectory .",
    "therefore , vision is thought to be used to continuously correct for differences in perceived target location with respect to locomotor trajectory @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of gvs on ac in the si during bw are unknown .    the combined effects of walking direction ( wd ) and the application of gvs on long - range ac in the si have not yet been investigated ; therefore the main aim of this study is to measure @xmath4 during fw and bw , with and without the application of binaural and monaural gvs .",
    "since @xmath4 is associated to predictability and @xmath5 to physiological complexity of the time series , we display our results in a ( @xmath4 , @xmath5)-plane and comment them within the theoretical model of optimal movement variability developed by stergiou and deker @xcite .",
    "our results are also compatible with the model of ahn and hogan @xcite stating that long - range ac may emerge from the dynamics of a particular pendular model of walking .",
    "thirty - four undergraduate and graduate healthy students ( 18 males , 16 females ) in physiotherapy took part to this study and were recruited at haute ecole louvain en hainaut ( charleroi , belgium ) .",

    "four walking conditions were studied during two measurement sessions on two different days : forward walking without gvs ( @xmath0 ) and with gvs ( @xmath1 ) and backward walking without gvs ( @xmath2 ) and with gvs ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "session 1 included @xmath0 and @xmath1 conditions and session 2 included @xmath2 and @xmath3 conditions . during each condition",
    ", subjects walked on the treadmill for 15 minutes . before each session , subjects were given five minutes to familiarize themselves with the treadmill and the conditions .",
    "subjects walked at their comfortable speed that was determined during the familiarization procedure by the same experimenter ( nal ) by tuning the speed of the belt while the subject was walking without gvs .",
    "the same speed was then imposed when gvs was applied . vertical ground reaction force ( @xmath9 ) and centre of pressure ( @xmath10 ) of each foot was recorded at a sampling rate of 500 hz using the manufacturer s software ( cuefors 2 , motekforce link , the netherlands ) .",
    "time series stride interval were computed from heel strikes ( during forward walking ) or toe strikes ( during backward walking ) of the right foot identified on @xmath9-time histories and time series step width from maximal medio - lateral displacement of @xmath10 of two consecutive steps .",

    "@xmath49 for a differentiable curve and 2 for a surface with differentiable boundary . for time",

    "efficient gait requires an overall coordination of the different body segments , carried out with visual , somatosensory and vestibular inputs .",
    "the rationale for the study is related to the three following points .",
    "first , there is actually a gap in the literature about the role of vestibular inputs in relation to walking direction .",
    "second , backward walking is frequently used in sports and in rehabilitation settings @xcite .",
    "third , while the use of gvs is an increasingly common clinical intervention on locomotion , we still lack a thorough understanding of its effects on stability in healthy subjects .",
    "therefore , this technique deserves more attention specifically when coupled to innovative measurements such as the ones adopted here . indeed",
    ", nonlinear dynamic stability measures may provide information on how the neuromuscular system controls locomotion and responds to small perturbations @xcite .",
    "we will now discuss the effects of walking direction and gvs on our results .",
    "walking direction has a major impact on our results .",
    "stride interval increased in backward walking compared to forward walking .",
    "this has been previously observed , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "this fact is coherent with the lower walking speed spontaneously chosen by the subjects when walking backward .",
    "the kinematic parameters @xmath66 and @xmath24 are larger in the backward walking conditions than in forward walking : fluctuations in the stride interval during backward walking are indeed larger than in forward walking . the increase of @xmath66 has been reported previously ( @xcite ) either for young or elderly adults while , to our knowledge , the corresponding increase in the step width has not been reported elsewhere .    in any of the four experimental conditions , stride interval time series exhibit long - range autocorrelations since @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note that our value of @xmath4 in the fw@xmath63 condition is compatible with that retained in the meta - analysis @xcite for healthy subjects : a 95 @xmath69 confidence interval of @xmath70 $ ] is quoted , while we obtain @xmath71 $ ] in the fw@xmath63 .",
    "the existence of autocorrelations in backward and forward walking has previously been proved in @xcite but no significant difference in the hurst exponent has been observed in this last study , presumably because of the smaller sample size ( 12 subjects ) . the hurst exponent appears to be larger in backward compared to forward walking .",
    "such an increase in @xmath4 has been reported in children up to typically 14 years old @xcite .",
    "the hurst exponent decreases to the optimal value with time . in the two cases of children walking forward and adults walking backward ,",
    "higher values of @xmath4 , corresponding to a more strongly autocorrelated motion ( actually more repetitive ) seem to be related to learning processes in walking .",
    "note that values computed in @xcite can not be _ stricto sensu _ compared to ours however since these authors computed the hurst exponent by using dfa with a second order detrending .    in their recent paper , ahn and hogan have shown that long - range autocorrelations may emerge from the dynamics of a particular pendular model of walking .",
    "their model , described in detail in @xcite , reduces the body to a point mass attached to rigid massless legs moving in a vertical plane under the influence of gravity .",
    "the hip is a genuine pivot , while the trailing leg produces a torque proportional to the ankle angle during double stance .",
    "the torque magnitude is moreover controlled by a constant randomly changing at each step according to a normal law . during single stance",
    ", the model is an inverted pendulum .",
    "this model has the peculiar feature of adding afferent feedback from the ankle and intrinsic neurophysiological noise to a classical , pendulum - like , walking model through the ankle torque and its random magnitude .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these ingredients seem to be a minimal requirement to reach stable walking with long - range autocorrelations similar to those observed in healthy subjects .",
    "one of the key plots of @xcite shows the variation of the hurst exponent computed on a range of 500 strides for realistic values of the different parameters versus the stride amplitude @xmath25 , which is fixed in their walking model .",
    "both parameters have been computed from experimental data in the present work , allowing a direct comparison of our results to those of @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our results and those of ahn and hogan s model is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : model ] : results from the fw~s0~ condition are clearly in agreement with the model .",
    "moreover , we think the bw~s0~ condition can be compared to the model too since the dynamical equations of ahn and hogan s model are invariant with respect to time reversal @xcite provided that the random variability of ankle torque is kept constant with respect to walking direction . as for fw~s0~ ,",
    "our results for the bw~s0~ condition match quite well with the trend of the model .",
    "the larger value of @xmath4 in the bw@xmath63condition can thus be related to the smaller value of @xmath25 by resorting to the peculiar pendular model of walking @xcite .",
    "galvanic vestibular stimulation is a known procedure to electrically stimulate vestibular afferents @xcite .",
    "continuous ( cgvs ) and noisy ( ngvs ) gvs are mostly studied . from a practical point of view ,",
    "one of the major differences lies in the perception of the current by the subject , which is directly related to the intensity of the applied current .",
    "the intensity during a cgvs typically ranges from 0.1 to 2 ma @xcite whereas for ngvs the same range is used but for peak intensity @xcite . here , we used cgvs with an average current of 1.4 ma .",
    "it was well tolerated by all subjects : msaq median scores reveal a rather weak disturbance of gvs , mostly related to the perturbation of the central nervous system .",
    "another important difference for the researchers and clinicians is that these stimulation modalities are used to achieve opposite effects : cgvs is applied to disrupt walking ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) while ngvs aims at improving it @xcite .",
    "since the interaction between visual and vestibular information during locomotion is not well understood @xcite , we have put in place a protocol with combined sensory perturbations . a previous study @xcite investigated visual ",
    "vestibular interactions with ngvs ( eyes closed ) and showed an increased dynamic walking stability in healthy subjects . here ,",
    "our objective was different .",
    "we have applied cgvs to disrupt walking and visual perturbation during backward walking was only a consequence of changing walking direction .",
    "in particular , the backward walking condition allows to study a visual disturbed condition in which subjects must rely more on other sources of sensory input , _",
    "i.e. _ cutaneous , proprioceptive , and vestibular senses @xcite .",
    "previously , vestibular inputs were thought to be primarily required for stabilizing the head to ensure stable gaze control during gait and for spatial orientation in navigational tasks @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has also been suggested that vestibular inputs play a role in maintaining dynamic walking stability since they generate phase - dependent influences on lower body control during walking by fine tuning the timing and magnitude of foot displacement @xcite . according to our results ,",
    "gvs significantly modifies the average stride interval and coefficient of variation of our stride interval time series , in agreement with the aforementioned role of vestibular inputs .",
    "since the effects of cgvs and ngvs have to be distinguished , only the effects of cgvs will be discussed hereafter .",
    "we think that the effects of ngvs would deserve a separate study .",
    "our results show that turning on cgvs influences walking differently according to direction . turning on cgvs during forward walking",
    "significantly modifies step width , @xmath24 , and the minkowski fractal dimension of the stride interval time series , @xmath5 .",
    "previous research has demonstrated that cgvs influence balance control during walking and that stability is mostly affected in the medio - lateral direction @xcite .",
    "this is in accordance with our results that show an increased @xmath24 during forward walking . in forward walking rehabilitation",
    ", cgvs is therefore a useful tool to work on balance in patients .",
    "turning on cgvs during backward walking significantly modifies @xmath22 and @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath22 increased compared to bw~s0~ , which implies an increase in the length of the stride since the speed between bw~s0~ and bw~s+~ conditions was not significantly different .",
    "this result suggests that vestibular inputs contribute to the control of stride length , at least during backward walking .",
    "the absence of significant result during forward walking could be explained by the difference of speed with direction ( forward : 4.4 @xmath59 vs backward : 2.2 @xmath59 ) since the existence of a hierarchical importance of vestibular information with speed has been showed ; a sensory perturbation has a higher impact on gait at slow speed than fast @xcite .",
    "having this in mind , imposing the same , slow , walking speed in both walking directions would probably be relevant for future works .",
    "our results are also inline with @xcite showing that planning of the foot placement at heel contact is modulated by vestibular information .    in terms of variability ,",
    "@xmath66 during bw~s+~ decreased compared to bw~s0~. in backward walking rehabilitation , cgvs is therefore a useful tool to work on the regularity of the steps in patients . the magnitude of @xmath66 is regularly associated to the risk of fall @xcite .",
    "we observe that turning on cgvs significantly decreases @xmath66 in backward walking ; hence training in bw~s+~ may be relevant to decrease the risk of fall . however , further studies are needed to demonstrate that backward walking training effects can be transferred to forward walking @xcite .",
    "stride interval time series exhibit long - range autocorrelation in both walking directions but cgvs has no significant influence on it .",
    "our results lead us to believe that vestibular inputs are not involved in their modulation .",
    "this is in favor of a mostly mechanical origin of stride interval on long - range autocorrelation @xcite .",
    "gvs has an influence on @xmath5 however .",
    "to our knowledge , it is the first time that @xmath5 was computed during @xmath1 . in this walking condition ,",
    "@xmath5 decreased compared to @xmath0 , indicating a less complex , smoother , stride interval time series .",
    "it is known that vestibular system provides essential contribution to the maintenance of balance throughout the stepping cycle , with phase - velocity / cadence - dependent modulation on the activity of hip , knee and ankle muscles @xcite .",
    "interestingly , vestibular - muscle coupling is specific for each muscle , probably organized according to each muscle s functional role in whole - body stabilization during walking .",
    "for example , @xmath72 and @xmath73 responses are strongest at heel strike , whereas @xmath74 is active before and after heel contact .",
    "we hypothesize that the less complex nature of the stride interval time series reflects the disruption of dynamic balance evoked by gvs .",
    "furthermore , the flexible organization of gvs - evoked responses in appendicular muscles also raises the question about the source and relevance of sensory feedback required to engage the vestibular control of balance @xcite . during bw , when vision is excluded , subjects rely more on other sources of sensory input @xcite and in this case @xmath5 was not modified during @xmath3 compared to @xmath2 .",
    "bw is known to increase the soleus h - reflex during the swing phase compared to fw , but after training of a bw task , or when subjects held on to handrails , the marked reflex increase in swing is no longer present @xcite .",
    "this suggested to the authors that the reflex increase in bw was related to elements of instability , since after training , the reflex increase reappears when subjects close their eyes during bw .",
    "our protocol was not designed to study the interaction between a specific source of sensory input and vestibular influences during walking but our results support the idea that the application of cgvs during bw could be of major importance in rehabilitation since we show that it significantly reduced @xmath66 without modifying @xmath4 and @xmath5 , measuring respectively the global behaviour or long - term memory and the local characteristic or roughness of the stride interval time series .",
    "stergiou and decker @xcite proposed that time series originating from human motion could be classified by using two indices .",
    "the first catches signal complexity and the other measures its predictability . in this context",
    ", a healthy motion should be chaotic , characterised by a maximal complexity reflecting the adaptability of the subject to exterior perturbation , and an intermediate predictability .",
    "pathological motion should be characterised by a lower complexity ( fewer adaptability ) and a predictability that could be either lower ( random ,  drunken - sailor - like \" , motion ) or higher ( robotic motion ) than the healthy motion .",
    "inspired by that picture , we propose to take d as a measure of the complexity of our time series . indeed",
    ", a large fractal dimension is associated to a rough signal , with possibly abrupt changes of values from a step to another .",
    "this is , to our opinion , a good indicator of complexity which has , moreover , already been successfully applied to study standard biomechanical parameters such as center of pressure variability in static equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the entropy is the most intuitive candidate to estimate the predictability of a time series , since it encodes the amount of information available from this time series .",
    "however we think that the hurst exponent could be a relevant predictability index too : @xmath4 can discriminate between a random motion ( @xmath45 ) and a far more predictable , strongly autocorrelated , time series ( @xmath75 ) . in that sense ,",
    "long - range autocorrelations are an indicator of predictability . in our opinion",
    ", the healthy subject should be characterised by a maximal value of @xmath5 and an optimal value of @xmath4 : any significant difference from this value could be interpreted as a potential indicator of pathological motion .",
    "our results are displayed in a @xmath76-plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : class ] .",
    "it clearly appears that the fw~s0~ condition  the healthy motion  has the higher complexity and an intermediate predictability as argued in @xcite .",
    "the other conditions , non - standard though not pathological either , have lower complexities .",
    "walking backward without gvs leads to a larger value of @xmath4 , that is a more stereotyped , more predictable walking .",
    "gvs slightly decreases @xmath4 in backward walking . in that condition , walking gets closer to a random process , presumably because of the perturbation of the vestibular system . as already pointed out , children walking forward also have a larger @xmath4 than healthy young adults walking forward .",
    "we have calculated from a freely available dataset @xcite the average @xmath5 for the 50 children having participated to the study .",
    "we found values equal to @xmath77 , a significantly lower value than in our @xmath0 condition ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) , as expected .    a case",
    "in which @xmath4 is smaller than the young , healthy , adult case , is the one of parkinson s disease .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath4 decreases with disease s severity .",
    "we have computed @xmath81 from the data of @xcite ( 20 patients with parkinson s disease walking for 10 min , with @xmath82 ) .",
    "although lower than our maximal , @xmath0 , the difference between both values is not significant ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) .",
    "similarly , neurodegenerative pathologies have actually been shown to generally decrease @xmath4 with respect to its optimal value @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that at least one of the two parameters @xmath76 is significantly modified when going from one condition to another .",
    "a two - dimensional representation is necessary to classify all the experimental conditions we study .",
    "hence it can be conjectured that the only study of @xmath4 in pathological cases may be too restrictive to discriminate between the pathologies and that more non - linear indexes are worth to be added .",
    "stride interval dynamics behave as a chaotic system exhibiting long - range autocorrelations independently of walking direction .",
    "the hurst exponent is however increased when walking backward , suggesting that the more predictable fluctuations of the stride interval reflect more stereotyped motion adopted by the subjects in response to this nonstandard condition .",
    "the magnitude of these fluctuations are however larger in backward walking , due to the weaker stability of the subjects .",
    "the trend of @xmath4 _ versus _ stride amplitude is compatible with a peculiar pendular model of walking incorporating afferent feedback from the ankle . according to our results",
    ", long - range autocorrelations might be mostly from mechanical origin .",
    "the minkowski fractal dimension complements the characterisation of stride interval variability by considering complexity , or , more intuitively the adaptive capacities of the subject while in motion .",
    "any nonstandard condition reduces complexity . in particular",
    ", gvs reduces stride interval complexity during forward walking .",
    "the present study thus opens new avenues as to how more accurately classify healthy or pathological walking according to the complexity and predictability of stride interval time series .",
    "our findings may finally have applications in the field of rehabilitation .",
    "they suggest that , in forward walking , gvs is a relevant tool to work on balance , while in backward walking , gvs may help improve steps regularity .",
    "further studies are however needed to demonstrate that backward walking training effects can be transferred to forward walking .",
