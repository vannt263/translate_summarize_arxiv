    "herzog introduced a generalization of local cohomology so called generalized local cohomology , denoted by @xmath17 which is isomorphic to @xmath18 .",
    "we note that if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 is the usual local cohomology .",
    "as is well known , the finiteness of the local cohomology modules have an important role in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry .",
    "many of mathematicians work on finiteness of local cohomology .",
    "one of approaches in finiteness is artinianess .",
    "authors , in [ bft ] , [ brs ] , [ rs ] and [ s ] studied artinianess of the graded modules @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ". in the recent paper we will study the artinianess of generalized graded local cohomology . here , we briefly mention some our results which have been proved in this paper .",
    "let @xmath24 be the least non - negative integer such that the graded module @xmath25 is not finitely generated .",
    "we prove that @xmath26 is artinian for each @xmath27 .",
    "we also prove that if @xmath2 is of finite projective dimension with @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the largest non - negative integer @xmath30 such that @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is artinian .",
    "in particular if @xmath33 is the largest non - negative integer @xmath30 such that @xmath34 , then @xmath35 .",
    "we prove a similar result for invariant @xmath36 which shows the largest non - negative integer @xmath30 such that @xmath37 is not artinain .",
    "moreover , we show that if @xmath17 is @xmath7-cofinite , then @xmath38 is artinian .",
    "finally we study artinianess of generalized local cohomology when @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", we prove that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are artinian for all @xmath42 .",
    "it should be noted that local flat morphism of local noetherian rings is faithfully flat .",
    "so , if @xmath43 is flat over @xmath10 and @xmath44 , then @xmath43 is faithfully flat over @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , it follows from [ k , theorem 1 ] that if @xmath45 is a faithfully flat local @xmath10-algebra , then @xmath46 is a graded artinian @xmath4-module if and only if @xmath47 is a graded artinian module over @xmath48 . in view of this argument , we have the following proposition .",
    "we prove the assertion by induction on @xmath30 . if @xmath50 , then @xmath51 is finitely generated ; and hence @xmath52 is finitely generated .",
    "thus there exists some positive integer @xmath53 such that @xmath54 and so the result follows in this case . now , suppose inductively that the result has been proved for all values smaller than or equal to @xmath30 with @xmath55 and we prove it for @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",

    "we note that for each @xmath30 , there is an isomorphism @xmath63 and then this module is an @xmath7-torsion finitely generated graded @xmath4-module .",

    "now , in view of the sequence @xmath70 , we can conclude that @xmath71 is artinian if and only if @xmath72 is artinian .",

    "let @xmath74 be an indeterminate and let @xmath75_{{\\frak m_0}r_0[\\mathbf{x}]}$ ] , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . then by the flat base change property of local cohomology , for each @xmath30 we have @xmath79 and using the above argument @xmath71 is artinian if and only if @xmath80 is artinian .",
    "so we may assume that the residue field @xmath81 of @xmath10 is infinite .",

    "therefore by the sequence @xmath95 , the module @xmath96 is artinian .",
