    "while there are several open issues about the way quantum dynamics is currently handled in loop quantum gravity , the pretty kinematics  or perhaps the mathematically elegant attempts to understand de sitter space in this framework ( see @xcite)can be separated and could well serve as a useful piece of our future understanding of quantum gravity without recourse to a background .    under some assumptions",
    ", loop quantum gravity implies that the black hole entropy is proportional to the area of the horizon @xmath1 @xcite as well as a numerical constant called the barbero - immirzi parameter @xcite whose value must be chosen appropriately so that the result agrees with the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "the frustrating role of the barbero - immirzi parameter recently changed a bit because of an interesting paper by dreyer @xcite .",
    "building on a proposal by bekenstein and mukhanov @xcite and extending a numerical observation by hod @xcite , dreyer proposed that the gauge group of lqg should be @xmath2 rather than @xmath3 .",
    "such a minor modification changes the barbero - immirzi parameter required to reproduce the bekenstein - hawking entropy from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "more importantly , this new constant leads to a new value of the minimal positive area @xmath6 . the frequency emitted by a black hole",
    "which is changing its area by this amount turns out to coincide with another frequency that has been only known numerically : the asymptotic real part of the frequencies of black hole s",
    "quasinormal modes .. the main reason was puzzling numerical results by kokkotas et al .",
    "@xcite that we will discuss in subsection [ generalove ] . ]",
    "they will be the focus of our paper .",
    "although an immediate reaction is that this agreement is a coincidence , we will present some evidence that it does not have to be an accident .",
    "for example , a concern is that the real part agrees with the conjectured value @xmath7 only in the first few decimal places and the following ones will show a discrepancy .",
    "we will show that this is not the case .",
    "the most important result of this paper is an analytical proof that the asymptotic frequency is indeed equal to @xmath8 for perturbations of even spin .",
    "we will also present several other arguments that the agreement might indicate something important .",
    "we will use methods of classical general relativity .",
    "every good theory of gravity should probably reproduce these results ( for large black holes , the frequencies can be still taken to be much smaller than @xmath9 , for example ) .",
    "the thermodynamic nature of our answer suggests that the result might tell us something nontrivial about quantum gravity .",
    "the possible radial spin-@xmath10 perturbations of the four - dimensional schwarzschild background @xcite are governed by the following master differential equation @xcite : we will treat this equation as a schrdinger equation with the ( regge - wheeler ) potential @xmath11 : morally speaking , the perturbation @xmath12 contains a factor of the spherical harmonic @xmath13 with the orbital angular momentum equal to @xmath14 that appears in the `` centrifugal '' term of .",
    "the numerator @xmath15 of the other term is usually called @xmath16 and is characteristic for perturbations of various spins .",
    "it might be useful to summarize its values for the most important examples of @xmath10 : the `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath17 is related to @xmath18 by we chose units with unit radius of the black hole s horizon : @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the difference @xmath20 is simply the usual schwarzschild warp factor .",
    "also , in the equivalent quantum mechanical problem the doubled mass equals @xmath21 .",
    "we want to study the equation on the interval because the potential is mostly positive ( for @xmath22 it is strictly positive ) , there are no discrete normalizable bound states .",
    "nevertheless it makes mathematical sense to look for discrete _ quasinormal _ states , analogous to quasistationary states in quantum mechanics whose frequency is allowed to be complex .",
    "these states are required to have purely outgoing boundary conditions both at the horizon @xmath23 _ and _ in the asymptotic region @xmath24 : such a constraint is as strong as the requirement of normalizability and singles out discrete solutions @xmath25 .",
    "it is however very hard to look for the right wave functions numerically because requires the exponentially decreasing component of the wave function to be absent asymptotically .",
    "separating the exponentially small contribution from the rest is an extremely difficult task , especially for large decay rates .",
    "the time dependence of the wave function in our quantum mechanical model is then @xmath26 , and because we want to study exponentially decaying while the latter is equal to @xmath25 .",
    "the spacetime equations of motion are second order equations",
    ". therefore one should not worry about our nonstandard sign in @xmath26 that was chosen to agree with literature .",
    "] modes , the imaginary part of @xmath25 will always be taken positive .",
    "this also implies that while the solutions can oscillate , they must also exponentially increase with @xmath27 .",
    "there is a reflection symmetry which changes the sign of @xmath28 .",
    "although the usual conventions describe the wave @xmath29 as outgoing at @xmath30 for @xmath31 , we will use the reflection symmetry and assume , without loss of generality , @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "the assumption @xmath33 is physical and important because our final result will originate , in a sense , from positive integers @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36while the quasinormal modes with small enough @xmath37 represent the actual damped vibrations of the black hole  those that bring it quickly to the perfect spherical shape ,",
    "the physical interpretation of the very unstable , high - overtone states with @xmath38 is more problematic . despite these conceptual problems ,",
    "the existence of such formal solutions implies the presence of poles in the transmission amplitude ( or equivalently , the one - particle green s function ) .",
    "such poles can be important just like in many other situations and we will investigate some possible consequences at the end of this paper .",
    "the following two subsections review the existing literature on the quasinormal modes and basics of lqg .",
    "the reader interested in our analytical computation is advised to continue with section [ ourproof ] .",
    "numerically it has been found by leaver @xcite , nollert @xcite , andersson @xcite and others that the @xmath39 quasinormal mode of a gravitational @xmath40 ( or scalar @xmath41 ) perturbation has frequency this asymptotic behavior is independent of the orbital angular momentum @xmath14 although the detailed values are irregular and @xmath14-dependent for finite @xmath37 .",
    "the asymptotic value is valid for @xmath40 as well as @xmath41 , for example ; we will argue that @xmath28 must asymptotically vanish for odd and half - integer values of @xmath10 .",
    "the number of quasinormal modes is infinite .",
    "this fact was proved ten years ago @xcite by methods that did not allow the authors to say anything about the frequencies .",
    "the real part in equals this constant has been determined numerically with the indicated accuracy .",
    "such a frequency is related to a natural value of the minimal area quantum @xmath42 , one of the values @xmath43 favored by bekenstein and mukhanov @xcite because of their ability to describe the black hole entropy from area - degenerate states . @xcite which also agrees with wheeler s idea _ it from bit _ , hod found the value @xmath44 more reasonable .",
    "also the authors of @xcite propose some arguments in favor of @xmath44 .",
    "although we disagree with the proposal of equally spaced black hole spectrum , we are grateful to j.bekenstein for correspondence about the early history of black hole thermodynamics . ]",
    "four years ago , hod @xcite became the first one to notice that the constant can be written in terms of @xmath45 and proposed a heuristic picture trying to explain this fact .",
    "as far as we know , our paper contains the first analytical proof that this number is indeed @xmath46 .",
    "guinn et al .",
    "@xcite presented two similar and very accurate higher - order wkb calculations .",
    "however , an undetermined subtlety makes their results invalid because they obtain @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 for the real part .",
    "the very recent paper @xcite can be viewed as a refined version of @xcite ; it leads to results that are compatible with the present paper .",
    "ashtekar proposed new variables for canonical quantization of einstein s theory .",
    "see for example @xcite for an efficient review of loop quantum gravity or @xcite for a more extensive one .",
    "the spatial three - dimensional components @xmath49 of the metric at @xmath50 are expressed in terms of the inverse densitized dreibeins @xmath51 the index @xmath52 is an adjoint index of some @xmath2 ( or formerly @xmath3 ) gauge theory and the components @xmath53 themselves are interpreted as the dual variables to the gauge field : note that the case of three spatial dimensions is special because the adjoint and vector representations of @xmath2 have the same dimension .",
    "the hilbert space is _ a priori _ the space of functionals of @xmath54 .",
    "however it is possible to consider the subspace of _ functions _ of @xmath2-valued open wilson lines defined on links of a `` spin network '' ; this is known as _ loop transform_. the union of such subspaces for all possible spin networks is dense in the original hilbert space . the functions on the cartesian product of many copies of the @xmath2 group manifold can be expanded into spherical harmonics .",
    "the open wilson lines , i.e.  the links , then carry a spin @xmath55 associated with the spherical harmonic , `` coloring '' the spin network .",
    "colored spin networks then form an orthogonal basis of the hilbert space .",
    "the most interesting result of this approach to quantization of gravity is the following area quantization law @xcite that results directly from and : here @xmath56 are spins defined on the links @xmath57 of a spin network ( not to be confused with @xmath10 introduced in ) that intersect a given two - dimensional sheet in the coordinate space .",
    "the physical area @xmath1 of the sheet depends on the dynamical metric variables .",
    "according to lqg , the physical area is `` concentrated '' in the intersections with the spin network .",
    "recall that colored spin networks form a basis of the hilbert space of an @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "theory instead of @xmath2 .",
    "they were motivated by the possibility of incorporating fermions into a future version of loop quantum gravity .",
    "we believe that there is no reason why a theory that is meant to rewrite gravitational physics should `` know '' about our desire to incorporate fermions .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 is more natural than @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3 gauge theory could lead to similar physics but @xmath55 could also be half - integers in this case .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath58 has not been supported by any numerical coincidences . ]",
    "the constant @xmath59 denotes the so - called barbero - immirzi parameter @xcite , a pure number that can be interpreted as the finite renormalization of @xmath60 between the planck scale and low energies .",
    "a specific value of @xmath59 is required for lqg to reproduce the bekenstein - hawking entropy as we will recall soon .",
    "the area becomes a quasicontinuous variable if it is large because of the contributions with @xmath61 : the ratios between numbers @xmath62 for different @xmath55 are irrational .",
    "nevertheless the typical microstates of a horizon are dominated by links with the minimal possible value of @xmath63 .",
    "if the links with higher values of @xmath63 were absent altogether , the spectrum of the area operator would become equally spaced .",
    "the step would be equal to @xmath64 for the entropy to come out correctly @xcite .",
    "if the relation between the area and the mass is preserved ( which is however hardly the case microscopically ) , the links with @xmath61 are _ essential _ to keep the energy spectrum as well as the spectrum of hawking radiation continuous",
    ". furthermore the emission of a typical hawking quantum should rearrange a large number of links  including links with @xmath65if lqg is to be compatible with hawking s semiclassical results , otherwise the spectrum would be peaked around discrete frequencies .",
    "this is one of the problems that was mentioned in footnote in the introduction .",
    "we believe that the assumption that the energy spectrum is discrete with spacing @xmath66 was incompatible with the spectrum of hawking radiation whose energies are of the same order but continuous .",
    "the correct interpretation is probably more subtle .",
    "if we reject hawking s prediction of highly thermal radiation , then we also have no more reasons to believe the calculation of black hole entropy that is an implication of the temperature calculation ; at least the numerical coefficient would be unjustified .",
    "we find it hardly acceptable to reject hawking s semiclassical calculations , in part because they have been confirmed by many developments in string theory .",
    "the need for a macroscopic rearrangement of many links ( including those with @xmath65 ) in lqg to explain a single hawking particle should not be too surprising because lqg needs a similar miraculous interplay between a large number of links to generate the flat space itself .",
    "one should also note that the problem is equally serious regardless of the value of @xmath67 and therefore we should not discard dreyer s proposal to switch from @xmath3 to @xmath2 on these grounds .",
    "while loop quantum gravity does not yet offer a well - defined framework to explain the key question why black hole entropy has no volume extensive contributions coming from the interior , there exist arguments that lqg implies the correct entropy of the horizons of all possible black holes i.e.  the entropy proportional to their area ( up to the universal constant mentioned a moment ago ) .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite as well as references therein for more information . instead of the sophisticated chern - simons computations initiated by krasnov ,",
    "let us review a simpler version of the argument .",
    "the observables @xmath68 living on the links intersecting a given area become undetermined and physical if the area happens to be a horizon .",
    "the mixed state of the black hole is dominated by microstates with the minimal allowed value of @xmath69 occupying most links ( for the @xmath3 gauge group , we would have @xmath70 ) . because of , the number of such links is each link carries @xmath71 possible @xmath72-components of the spin and therefore the number of microstates equals the corresponding power of @xmath71 , namely this is equal to the exponential of the black hole entropy @xmath73 for such a value of @xmath59 may seem very unnatural .",
    "however dreyer @xcite has recently suggested an independent argument for this particular value of @xmath59 . because we disagree with several details of his argument",
    ", we will present a modified version of it .",
    "assume that a new link with @xmath69 is _ absorbed _ by a black hole horizon ( or it is _ created _ there ) .",
    "its area therefore increases by @xmath74 , which is according to and equal to because @xmath75 , this variation can be written as it follows there should be a preferred frequency ( energy ) associated with the emission of the most generic link . while black holes emit hawking radiation with continuous frequencies , the special frequency @xmath76 turns out to be exactly equal to the asymptotic real part of the quasinormal frequencies in ( divided by @xmath77 ) .",
    "we believe that the special frequency should _ not _ be interpreted as the energy of a physical hawking quantum which is continuous .",
    "because dreyer was forced to switch from @xmath3 to @xmath2 and because the justification of @xmath45 on one side was only numerical , it is clear that his argument is nontrivial .",
    "although we do not think that the imaginary part can be ignored in dreyer s mechanistic arguments involving the bohr s frequency and one can criticize other issues , such a coincidence nevertheless deserves an explanation .",
    "the first step is to extend the numerical evidence for the @xmath45 form of this asymptotic frequency into an exact analytical derivation .",
    "we will realize this step in the next section .",
    "the solution of can be expanded in the following way ( see for example @xcite ) : the prefactor is meant to satisfy the boundary conditions :    * @xmath78 is necessary for the correct leading behavior at @xmath79 i.e. @xmath80 ; * @xmath81 fixes the behavior at @xmath82 i.e. @xmath83 ; * @xmath84 repairs the subleading behavior at @xmath80 coming from the logarithmic term in .",
    "the power series converges for @xmath85 and also for @xmath86 if the boundary conditions at @xmath86 are preserved .",
    "the equation is equivalent to the recursion relation where the coefficients @xmath87 can be extracted from the equation and rewritten in the following convenient way : @xmath88 note that except for the factor @xmath34 in @xmath89 , the coefficients @xmath87 depend on @xmath90 only through their combination @xmath91 .",
    "the initial conditions for the recursion relation guarantee that the boundary conditions at @xmath92 will be preserved .",
    "they are @xmath93 ( or any nonzero constant ) and @xmath94 ( which also implies @xmath95 for all positive integers @xmath34 as a result of ) .",
    "we also define the minus sign was chosen to agree with @xcite .",
    "the relation then implies or , equivalently , @xmath96 can be consequently written as an infinite continued fraction .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath92 , i.e.  @xmath94 , take the form the convergence of at @xmath86 implies a particular asymptotic form of @xmath96 for large @xmath34 ( and @xmath97 for @xmath98 ) and the boundary conditions require .",
    "the equation , written in terms of continued fractions , is then a condition that @xmath25 must satisfy for a quasinormal mode to exist :      let us now consider @xmath25 with a huge positive imaginary part . because @xmath99 as @xmath98 @xcite ( in other words , @xmath100 ) and because for large @xmath101 , the changes of @xmath96 slow down , it is an extremely good approximation to assume that @xmath96 changes adiabatically as long as @xmath34 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 : such an approximation is good for @xmath103 ( where we calculate @xmath96 recursively from @xmath104 ) as well as @xmath105 ( where we start the computation with @xmath106 ) .",
    "note that a similar fact holds for the coefficients of the taylor expansion of the exponential . by inserting @xmath107 into",

    "note that neglecting this first term is equivalent to neglecting @xmath118 in the original quadratic equation ; this term will turn out to be irrelevant for _ all _ values of @xmath34 in the large @xmath101 limit , with the possible exception of some purely imaginary frequencies where @xmath89 or @xmath119 vanish .",
    "the ratio of @xmath114\\pm m}$ ] can be calculated from as the ratio of @xmath120 for @xmath121 :    because the assumptions that led to for @xmath122 where the coefficients @xmath123 strongly depend on @xmath34 and furthermore contain terms of order @xmath124 ( or @xmath125 ) that now can not be neglected , in the present case , the breakdown of the generic result is analogous to the way how the simple _ ansatz _ for the wave function in the wkb approximation _ breaks down _ near the classical turning points . ]",

    "we will be able to calculate the continued fraction exactly in the @xmath126 limit .",
    "the continued fraction must predict the same ratio as the adiabatic argument because these two solutions must be eventually `` connected . ''",
    "this agreement will impose a non - trivial constraint on @xmath25 .",

    "it is clear that the effect of @xmath129 in goes to zero .",
    "the only possible exception is the case when @xmath89 and/or @xmath119 become almost zero for some @xmath34 ; this exception can not occur for nonzero @xmath28 but we will study it in the next subsection .    because @xmath129 does not affect the asymptotic frequencies , the orbital angular momentum @xmath14 is irrelevant , too .",
    "therefore the asymptotic frequencies will depend on @xmath10 only ( which is contained in the definition of @xmath119 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath34 in can be replaced by the constant @xmath133 $ ] as the frequency goes to infinity if we want to study a relatively small neighborhood of @xmath134 $ ] only .",
    "moreover , the continued fraction simplifies into an ordinary fraction .",
    "inserting recursively into itself @xmath135 times tells us that the dependence of all coefficients @xmath136 on @xmath25 was suppressed .",
    "now we can combine and to eliminate the remainders @xmath96 ; we will formulate the requirement that the generic adiabatic solution that is valid almost everywhere can be `` patched '' with the exact solution for @xmath137 $ ] that has also been simplified by the large @xmath101 limit .",
    "fortunately , the products of @xmath89 and @xmath119 can be expressed in the language of the @xmath138 function ( partially because @xmath139 ; this is a deeper reason why we write @xmath16 as @xmath140 ) .",
    "since @xmath119 is bilinear , the four factors inside the product actually lead to a product of @xmath141 factors , each of which is equal to a ratio of two @xmath138 functions .",

    "the necessary condition for the _ regular _ asymptotic frequencies ( i.e. frequencies where our analysis is valid ; we will explain this point later ) becomes we chose @xmath147 so that we could erase @xmath111 from the arguments of the trigonometric functions .",
    "we are also allowed to replace @xmath148 by @xmath25 again because the functions in are periodic with the right periodicity and we could have chosen the number @xmath149 $ ] even .",

    "this form of our result can be easily derived if we multiply by the denominator of the right hand side and expand the @xmath151 functions in terms of the exponentials .",
    "one can be more careful about the signs to see that the correct result must satisfy where @xmath156 is the sign function .",
    "note that the modulus of the left hand side is never smaller than one , and therefore the asymptotic quasinormal modes do not exist for @xmath157 .",
    "let us now study for various physical values of @xmath10 . if @xmath10 is a half - integer , the right - hand side of equals @xmath158 .",
    "the allowed frequencies are therefore if @xmath10 is an odd integer , the right - hand side of equals @xmath159 and we obtain because the frequencies in and lead to an indeterminate form in in other words , @xmath89 and/or @xmath119 vanishes for certain values of @xmath34our analysis , strictly speaking , breaks down for these frequencies and more effort is needed to decide whether these solutions are physical .",
    "we will discuss these issues in the next subsection . at any rate , all these possible frequencies have a vanishing real part .",
    "on the other hand , the result for even @xmath10 ( scalar or gravitational perturbations ) is more interesting .",
    "there is no cancellation and simplifies to this is the solution that has been used to support loop quantum gravity .    * a partial summary : * the only `` regular '' quasinormal frequencies that follow from our equations  without encountering indeterminate forms  are those with the real part equal to @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "it is also conceivable that there are solutions with @xmath162 for odd @xmath10 and @xmath163 for half - integer @xmath10 ( with vanishing real part ) where our analysis breaks down . in the next subsection",

    "in this ( most likely unphysical ) case we again obtain no solutions ( even if one allows the sign function in to be replaced by an arbitrary sign ) .      the purpose of this subsection is to resolve the question marks regarding the special frequencies where our approximation , neglecting @xmath129 , breaks down .",
    "first , we want to argue that the `` regular '' solutions are guaranteed to exist .",
    "once we are able to relate the remainders @xmath165}$ ] through the continued fraction where we are allowed to neglect @xmath129 as we said , we can also extrapolate them to .",

    "but the signs turn out to agree with the signs of @xmath169 that lead to our solutions automatically .",
    "the _ necessary _ condition for @xmath25 is also _",
    "sufficient_. the only solutions of this kind are the @xmath45 solutions from .",
    "their existence is guaranteed .    in order to find all irregular solutions , we start with two useful observations .    * the continued fraction depends on the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath170 , but only through their products @xmath171 . *",
    "if zeroes appear in exclusively in the numerator or the denominator , the ratio @xmath172-m}/r_{[-2 i\\omega]+m}$ ] will be effectively either zero , or infinite . after we take @xmath129 into the account , `` zero '' or `` infinity '' is replaced by a negative or positive power of @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the second point implies that the only possibility to obtain irregular solutions is to find @xmath25 such that is an indeterminate form of type @xmath173 .",
    "because @xmath89 can vanish at most for one value of @xmath34 , there must be at least one value of @xmath34 where @xmath119 vanishes .",
    "equation then implies that @xmath174 or @xmath175 ( or both ) must be integer .    for an integer or half - integer spin , @xmath10",
    ", these two conditions are equivalent and therefore both numbers @xmath176 must be integers for the quasinormal mode to have a chance to exist . in the half - integer case this condition precisely agrees with the solutions proposed in : because the numbers @xmath176 differ by an odd integer for a half - integer @xmath10 , one of the corresponding @xmath119 factors appears in the numerator and the other appears in the denominator of and allows for an indeterminate form .",
    "the coefficients @xmath89 are then guaranteed to be nonzero for all @xmath34 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath25 from affects the ratio in a generic fashion . for a suitable choice of this deviation ,",
    "the indeterminate form is regularized to @xmath169 once we include the effect of two relevant coefficients @xmath129 .",
    "we have checked the existence of solutions with _ mathematica_. in the case of @xmath177 , for each allowed value of @xmath37 there are two solutions with nonzero @xmath178 that converge to zero .",
    "now consider the case of integer @xmath10 .",
    "as stated above , both numbers @xmath176 must be integers .",
    "but if @xmath10 is integer , then these two numbers differ by an _ even _ number .",
    "it follows that both vanishing factors of @xmath119 appear in the numerator of , or both appear in the denominator of this fraction . without loss of generality ,",

    "we can again find such a deviation from that the effect of @xmath129 gives us any desired result . for @xmath180",
    "we therefore confirmed the existence of the states while for @xmath181 the _ regular _ states from are the _ only _ solutions . our numerical calculations done using _ mathematica _ furthermore indicate that for each allowed value of @xmath37 there are two states with nonzero values of @xmath178 that approach zero as @xmath182 .    to amuse the reader",
    ", we would like to mention that for the special unphysical choice of the spin @xmath164 discussed previously , at most one of the numbers @xmath179 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 can be integer and therefore we obtain only one zero in either in the numerator _ or _ in the denominator .",
    "this is not enough to end up with the indeterminate form of type @xmath173 .",
    "therefore for @xmath164 there are _ no _ asymptotic quasinormal modes : neither _ regular _ nor _ irregular_. this contrasts with the behavior for general @xmath10 where we find four finite _ regular _ asymptotic quasinormal modes in every strip @xmath183 .",
    "we showed that all irregular solutions that we have found are precisely the solutions where led to a cancellation of zero against infinity .",
    "all solutions can be summarized by the equation that we mentioned previously .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize our general procedures to related cases and apply the methods of answer analysis to other calculational frameworks .",
    "we have the following points in mind :    * * reissner - nordstrm charged black holes .",
    "* it is possible to write down the wave function as an expansion in @xmath184 similar to @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the critical behavior could be analogous to ours .",
    "one might be forced to add one or two terms to because the reissner - nordstrm warp factor contains an extra term @xmath185 .",
    "it has been recently shown by functional @xcite and numerical @xcite methods that the universal hod - like result @xcite is replaced by a more complicated equation : * * kerr and kerr - newman rotating ( and charged ) black holes .",
    "* in the case of kerr black holes ( with @xmath186 ) , it is still possible to separate the differential equations into radial and angular equations ; see for example @xcite .",
    "investigation of the quasinormal modes by the methods of this paper as well as the methods of @xcite is in progress @xcite . but",
    "some numerical calculations have already been done @xcite .",
    "they indicate that the answer @xmath187 is not universal ; in fact , their calculation seem to imply that the quasinormal modes do not exist for @xmath188 where the critical angular momentum is @xmath189 .",
    "this result would mean that the connection between the area quantum and quasinormal modes of the schwarzschild black holes @xcite was a coincidence that does not generalize to other black holes .",
    "therefore it is desirable to confirm or reject the results of @xcite by other means @xcite . * * black holes in ads spaces .",
    "* a more detailed analysis of black hole quasinormal modes in anti de sitter space might be interesting especially because the maldacena s ads / cft correspondence might shed a new light on their origin .",
    "papers @xcite show that the facts about the black hole quasinormal modes in the ads space can be reinterpreted in terms of thermal physics of the dual conformal field theory . in @xcite ,",
    "the continued fractions play an important role .",
    "however , the asymptotic structure of the quasinormal modes of the ads black holes differs from the flat space in many important respects .",
    "these differences follow from a different asymptotic geometry of the spacetime .",
    "for example , even the asymptotic frequencies depend on @xmath14 .",
    "not only the imaginary part , but also the real part of the frequencies diverge .",
    "there is no @xmath45 limit .",
    "the recurrence relation describing the quasinormal modes of ads black holes has also been studied @xcite . *",
    "* de sitter space and rindler space . * the usual perturbations of de  sitter space form an integrable system that does not exhibit the @xmath45 effect , at least in the simplest models that we checked ( which however corresponded to @xmath190 where our prediction for @xmath28 vanishes anyway ) .",
    "the perturbations of rindler space can be rewritten as a quantum mechanical model with the potential @xmath191 .",
    "this is the asymptotic behavior of for @xmath82 and a general property associated with the horizons .",
    "the solutions are simply bessel functions ; see @xcite for another application of the same bessel equation .",
    "we do not know a clear argument determining what the boundary condition at @xmath192 should be .",
    "therefore we can not derive a similar @xmath45 effect in the rindler space ; it is even impossible to associate a unique temperature scale with the whole rindler space and therefore it might be unreasonable to expect any definite answer .",
    "another contradiction is that the result should be @xmath10-dependent as we have seen in the schwarzschild case , but the regge - wheeler - like potential for the rindler space seems to be @xmath10-independent . *",
    "* higher - dimensional black holes . * the calculation of the higher - dimensional schwarzschild black hole s quasinormal modes could lead to much more important and interesting results .",
    "this is not just our belief ; see the recent speculative attempt @xcite to predict the higher - dimensional behavior .",
    "even if the general structure of the modes remains valid , the factor of @xmath45 in could be replaced by a different constant  for example @xmath193 .",
    "the recent paper @xcite showed that it was possible to calculate quasinormal modes in higher dimension ; their asymptotic behavior was finally calculated in a very recent paper @xcite that is based on functional methods .",
    "the quasinormal modes of scalar perturbations of schwarzschild black holes seem to approach @xmath187 in any dimension .",
    "this result seems puzzling from the viewpoint of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to reproduce or reject this result by numerical calculations and/or by the methods of this paper .",
    "however , the five - dimensional schwarzschild black hole would probably lead to a recursion relation of the fifth order that is much more difficult to handle .",
    "+ let us mention a very unlikely ( but not quite impossible ) speculative scenario .",
    "imagine that for 11-dimensional black holes or black branes of some kind , @xmath45 in is replaced by @xmath194 in the case of _ gravitational _ perturbations .",
    "such a coincidence would probably encourage many to search for a spin network description of ( the bosonic part of ) the 11-dimensional supergravity based on the @xmath195 gauge theory .",
    "such a description might be related to the usefulness of @xmath195 gauge theory in the bulk for the path integral quantization of the three - form potential , studied by diaconescu , moore , and witten @xcite .",
    "the @xmath195 gauge field has a sufficient number of components to include the three - potential ( expressed as the chern - simons three - form ) as well as the metric that could be perhaps written in the ( almost ) usual lqg fashion : the field @xmath196 has many components , @xmath197 .",
    "while it might sound like a very redundant choice , we think that the meaningful proposals of lqg can be generalized to any spacetime dimension , as long as we allow the gauge theory configuration space to be bigger than the configuration space of pure gravity . for example , the quantization of two - dimensional areas in four spacetime dimension _ must _ generalize to the quantization of @xmath198-dimensional areas in @xmath199 spacetime dimensions  which is directly implied e.g.  by .",
    "the reason is simply that the @xmath198-dimensional areas determine the entropy .",
    "* * the wkb approximation . *",
    "the article @xcite tried to solve the problem of the highly damped quasinormal modes in the wkb approximation .",
    "although the authors could calculate the subleading corrections at very high orders , it was later realized that a subtlety invalidates this wkb approximation even at zeroth order because their asymptotic @xmath200 for the highly damped modes is incorrect  certainly for general real values of @xmath10 .",
    "subsequently andersson and linnus @xcite improved the method of @xcite and looked for the highly damped quasinormal modes again but the asymptotic behavior was not understood analytically .",
    "we should note that the wkb prescription of @xcite seems to break down in a controllable way .",
    "furthermore , the resulting frequencies should be a periodic function of @xmath10 that appears , through the combination @xmath15 , in the coefficient of the @xmath201 term of the potential in @xcite .",
    "the correct result was finally reproduced by functional methods in a very recent paper @xcite .",
    "we start this section by rewriting the equation for the quasinormal modes in usual units where @xmath202 and @xmath203 : note that the ratio between the real part and the spacing of the imaginary part equals @xmath204 , regardless of the choice of units .",
    "it is useful to recall that the hawking temperature of the schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath111 equals @xmath205 .",
    "consequently , the equation can be also written as we can remove the term proportional to @xmath34 simply by exponentiating ( @xmath206 in gives the minus sign below ) : because the quasinormal modes show the position of poles of the transmission amplitude in the corresponding quantum mechanical model  and these poles will probably also have some interpretation in the spacetime terms  the asymptotic structure of this transmission amplitude ( for large @xmath37 , and perhaps for large @xmath101 in general ) will be proportional to the factor the roots obtained by the reflection symmetry have a negative imaginary part @xmath207 and lead to a similar factor @xmath208 .",
    "these denominators are reminiscent of thermal physics .",
    "actually , had we started with our results for the odd spin and the half - integer spin , the same procedure would have given us a more familiar factor in the transmission amplitude proportional to this is exactly the average occupation number in bose - einstein statistics ( for @xmath10 odd the denominator has a minus sign ) or fermi - dirac statistics ( for @xmath10 half - integer the denominator has a plus sign ) . in both cases the statistics agrees with the spin @xmath10 of the perturbation .",
    "we can imagine that the transmission amplitude results from an interaction of the given particle with a thermal bath of temperature @xmath209 , containing particles of the same statistics .",
    "in other words , the amplitude is related to the thermal green s function in the schwarzschild background ; this explains the general form of and .",
    "this agreement makes the result for the even values of @xmath10 even more puzzling . why do we fail to obtain the same bose - einstein factor as we did for odd @xmath10",
    "instead , we calculated a result more similar to the half - integer case , i.e.  fermi - dirac statistics with the number @xmath210 replacing the usual number @xmath124 ; let us call it _ tripled pauli statistics_. such an occupation number can be derived for objects that satisfy the pauli s principle , but if such an object does appear ( only one of them can be present in a given state ) , it can appear in three different forms .",
    "does it mean that scalar quanta and gravitons near the black hole become ( or interact with ) @xmath211 links ( triplets ) in a spin network that happen to follow the pauli s principle ?",
    "our puzzling results are summarized in the table below .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the asymptotic periodicity of the time coordinate in the euclidean black hole solutions equals the inverse hawking temperature @xmath212 exactly if there is no deficit ( or excess ) angle at the horizon ( which is a `` tip '' of the solution ) . in this sense ,",
    "the euclidean solution `` knows '' about the hawking temperature .",
    "black holes can only be in equilibrium with a heat bath of the hawking temperature because if we want to consider black hole configurations contributing to the path integral , we are forced to take the right periodicity of the time direction .",
    "if we glance at , we see that the quasinormal modes also `` know '' about the right temperature .",
    "the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in the case of spin @xmath213 satisfy @xmath214 .",
    "but @xmath215 is the evolution operator by @xmath212 in the euclidean time .",
    "so the allowed asymptotic frequencies are exactly the frequencies that respect the time periodicity .",
    "alternatively , the transmission amplitude contains the information about the thermal ensemble",
    ". both hawking radiation as well as quasinormal modes deal with general relativity linearized around the black hole solution , so it is perhaps not too surprising that they contain a similar piece of information .",
    "we understand that is a natural expression related to the thermal properties of the black hole .",
    "but what about , which has @xmath216 instead of @xmath217 in the denominator ?",
    "these quasinormal frequencies appear for @xmath161 . they satisfy @xmath218 ( or @xmath219 , if we consider the solutions with the negative real part ) .",
    "just like the solutions and lead to which correspond to the path integral with periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions on the time coordinate of periodicity @xmath212 , the extra frequencies seem to lead to the path integral where the fluctuations get multiplied by @xmath220 ( or @xmath221 , which is related to @xmath220 by the time reversal symmetry ) if we perform a rotation around the euclidean time .",
    "such boundary conditions correspond to the evaluation of the thermal expectation value of the operator where @xmath222 is the number of gravitons ( or scalar quanta ) in the state . just as the frequencies and inform us that the thermal expectation values of various ordinary operators contain the denominator , the extra quasinormal modes might perhaps hide a similar insight .",
    "note that the insertion of @xmath223 in might be interpreted as a chemical potential for gravitons ( or scalar quanta ) in a grand canonical ensemble @xmath224 .",
    "something special should happen when the chemical potential @xmath225 formally approaches the ( complex ) value @xmath226 .    in loop quantum gravity",
    ", @xmath45 arises as the entropy of a single link with the minimal possible spin @xmath69 ( we assume the @xmath2 version of lqg ) .",
    "an advocate of loop quantum gravity could argue in the following way : @xmath223 is an operator that receives some `` resonant '' contributions from the nontrivial quasinormal modes .",
    "the reason could be that @xmath223 might actually be the operator that creates ( or destroys ) a single link of the spin network .",
    "the number @xmath210 ( or @xmath220 , we have no understanding of the minus sign at this point ; it might arise from fermi - like statistics of some objects such as the @xmath211 links ) would be related to the number of possible @xmath227 polarizations of the new link .",
    "the number of gravitons @xmath222 would be correlated with the number of the links in some unknown way .",
    "finally , there could also be an explanation why the creation operator of a link has a large resonant expectation value in the canonical ensemble describing a black hole .",
    "only time can show whether these speculations can be supported by a consistent formalism .",
    "in this paper we calculated the asymptotic form of the frequencies of the quasinormal modes on the four - dimensional schwarzschild background .",
    "we used the method of taylor expansion and continued fractions that can be approximated very well for large frequencies by imposing the constraint that the quantities @xmath96 , describing the continued fractions , change slowly .",
    "for the values of index @xmath34 near @xmath228 , this estimate breaks down for general values of @xmath25 .",
    "but for large @xmath101 the recursion relations near @xmath228 can be approximated by an exactly solvable system .",
    "the continued fractions become ordinary fractions .",
    "the expressions can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath138 function and then even in terms of trigonometric functions .",
    "the result for odd and half - integer spins @xmath10 of the perturbation are the frequencies but for even integer spins @xmath10 we proved the existence of modes with we conjectured that these asymptotic frequencies of quasinormal modes can be found for other black holes , too , as long as the frequency is written as a multiple of the hawking temperature ; the result was recently confirmed in the case of higher - dimensional schwarzschild black holes @xcite , but ruled out in the reissner - nordstrm case @xcite as well as the case of kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "while carries some information on the thermal structure of the black hole , the significance of the nontrivial frequencies remains clouded in mystery .",
    "we presented speculations how might be understood in the language related to loop quantum gravity .",
    "it would be interesting to    * check more carefully whether all _ a priori _ allowed solutions in and exist ; look for the `` irregular '' solutions numerically ; it is however true that some very difficult numerical calculations become less interesting because their computational goals can now be achieved analytically * generalize the calculation to higher - dimensional black holes and derive what @xmath7 is replaced by ; a very recent paper @xcite confirmed that @xmath187 appears for scalar perturbations of schwarzschild black holes in an arbitrary dimension * try to apply similar methods to the case of charged black holes and black holes in the anti de sitter space ; functional methods have been used to derive the aperiodic structure of the reissner - nordstrm black holes in four dimensions @xcite and this structure has been confirmed in a very recent paper @xcite * investigate the asymptotic structure of the quasinormal modes of rotating kerr black holes in four dimensions ; preliminary results suggest that @xmath187 is _ not _ the universal answer in this case @xcite * calculate the subleading contributions in @xmath229 to @xmath28 using our methods or the methods of @xcite as the zeroth order approximation * find an interpretation of the real part that does not involve loop quantum gravity * or even more ambitiously , find a solid interpretation in terms of loop quantum gravity ; our analysis never led to the number @xmath230 ; does it show that loop quantum gravity is inconsistent with the existence of fermions ?",
