    "germanium detector array ( gerda ) @xcite is an experiment searching for the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay of @xmath1ge .",
    "high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors enriched in @xmath1ge to @xmath8 are exposed acting both as sources and detection media .",
    "the experimental signature of @xmath0 decay is a peak in the spectrum of the summed energies of the two electrons , released in the nuclear process .",
    "the peak is expected at the @xmath9 value that for @xmath1ge is @xmath10kev .",
    "the events from @xmath0 decays can be distinguished from @xmath11-induced background ; infact it is expected that the energy deposition of the two emitted electrons is localized within few mm ( single - site events , sse ) while @xmath11-rays deposit energy in several positions ( multi - site events , mse ) .",
    "the signals are different for sse and mse ; surface events from @xmath12 or @xmath13 decays also exhibit characteristic shapes .",
    "thus , pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) techniques can improve the experimental sensitivity .",
    "the half - life on @xmath0 decay can be calculated as @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the avogadro number , @xmath16 is the isotopic mass of the considered isotope , @xmath17 is the observed signal strength , @xmath18 the total source mass and @xmath19 the live time of the measurement .",
    "the total efficiency @xmath20 is the product of several factors : @xmath21 @xmath22 is the fraction of @xmath1ge atoms , @xmath23 is the active volme fraction , @xmath24 is the signal acceptance by the psd and @xmath25 is the probability that a @xmath0 decay releases its entire energy in the detector , losses are due to bremsstrahlung photons , fluorescence x - rays or electrons escaping the detector active volume .",
    "the construction of gerda was tailored to background minimization .",
    "the germanium detectors are mounted in low mass ultra - pure holders and are directly inserted in @xmath26m@xmath27 of liquid argon ( lar ) , acting as cooling medium and shield against external background radiation ( fig .",
    "[ gerda - view ] shows the section of the gerda setup ) .",
    "the argon cryostat is complemented by a water tank with @xmath28 m diameter which further shields from neutron and @xmath11 backgrounds .",
    "it is instrumented with photomultipliers to veto the cosmic muons by detecting erenkov radiation .",
    "the muon veto hermeticity is provided by plastic scintillators installed on the top of the structure .",
    "a detailed description of the experimental setup is in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a first physics data collection , denoted as phase i , was carried out from november 2011 to june 2013 . in this phase",
    "eight p - type semi - coaxial detectors enriched in @xmath1ge from the heidelberg - moscow ( hdm ) @xcite and igex @xcite experiments and five broad energy germanium ( bege ) detectors were used @xcite .",
    "three coaxial detectors with natural isotopic abundance from the genius test facility ( gtf ) project @xcite were also installed .    in 2013 , at the completion of phase i , the setup upgrade was started ; in 2015 many test and commissioning runs were performed and since january 2016 the phase ii physics data taking is ongoing .      from november 2011 to may 2013 a global exposure of @xmath29kg@xmath7yr has been collected .",
    "data blinding was implemented for the first time in a @xmath0 experiment data analysis protocol .",
    "events with energies within @xmath30kev were not processed .",
    "after the fine energy calibration , the psd criteria and the background model were finalized the window was opened except for @xmath31kev ( @xmath32kev ) around @xmath9 for the semi - coaxial ( bege ) detectors ; only at the end the @xmath9 region were analyzed .",
    "the gerda background model @xcite predicts a flat energy distribution between 1930 and 2190 kev from compton events of @xmath11 rays of @xmath33tl and @xmath34bi decays , degraded @xmath12 events and @xmath13 rays from @xmath35k and @xmath34bi .    in the range @xmath36kev",
    "seven events are observed before the psd , to be compared to @xmath37 expected background counts .",
    "three out of the six events from the semi - coaxial detectors are classified as sse by the artificial neural network ( ann ) method , consistent with the expectation .",
    "the event in the bege data set is rejected by the @xmath38 cut ( the powerful psd method for the beges that uses the ratio between the ampitude of the current pulse @xmath39 and the total energy @xmath40 ) , hence no events remain within @xmath41 after psd .    the combined energy spectrum around @xmath9 , with and without the psd selection , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ spectrum - psd ] .        to derive the signal strength @xmath42 and a frequentist coverage interval ,",
    "a profile likelihood fit was performed @xcite .",
    "the fitted function consists of a constant term for the background and a gaussian peak for the signal with mean at @xmath9 and standard deviation @xmath43 according to the expected resolution .",
    "the best fit value is @xmath44 that means no signal events above the background .",
    "the derived half - life limit on @xmath0 decay is : @xmath45 including the systematic uncertainty .",
    "gerda phase i data show no indication of a peak at @xmath9 and the claim for the observation of @xmath0 @xcite decay in @xmath1ge is not supported .",
    "this result is consistent with the limits by hdm and igex experiments and extending the profile likelihood fit including the data sets of those experiment the best fit yields is still @xmath44 and a new limit for the @xmath0 decay is established : @xmath46    in addition to the new limit on the @xmath0 , the phase i data allowed to establish the new value for the two neutrino accompanied @xmath47 decay ( @xmath48yr ) , to search for neutrinoless @xmath47 decay processes accompanied with majoron emission ( no signals were found and lower limits of the order of @xmath49yr were set ) @xcite and to study the two neutrino @xmath47 decay of @xmath1ge to excited states of @xmath1se @xcite ( no signal observed and new bounds determined for three transition , two orders of magnitude larger than those reported previously ) .",
    "the gerda phase ii goal is the reduction of a factor of ten the background obtained in phase i and this can only be achieved with an optimized experimental design .",
    "after several years of r & d , a version of the broad energy germanium ( bege ) detector @xcite from canberra with a thick entrance window has been selected .",
    "the advantages of using the bege detectors are their superior rejection of background with a simple and powerful analysis and their optimal energy resolution due to a very low detector capacitance .",
    "in addition an active suppression of background by detecting the lar scintillation light is introduced .",
    "[ array2 ] shows the core of the phase ii gerda setup : the ge detector array , whose mass is doubled compared to phase i , is at the center of a vetoed lar volume .",
    "the design allows to assemble both the detector array and the surrounding lar veto system in the open lock under dry nitrogen atmosphere and to lower both systems together into the cryostat .",
    "the bege detectors for phase ii ( 5 of them already used in phase i ) are a modified model be5030 available from canberra semiconductor ( olen ) . a schematic view of a bege diode is shown in fig . [ bege ] .",
    "the detector is made of p - type hpge with the li@xmath50 drifted n@xmath51 contact ( @xmath52 mm specified thickness ) covering the whole outer surface , including most of the bottom part .",
    "the small p@xmath51 contact is located in the middle of the bottom side .",
    "the raw material for the bege diodes enriched in @xmath1gehas been produced in form of @xmath53 kg of @xmath54geo@xmath55 from ecp ( zelonogorsk , russia ) with the @xmath1geisotope enriched to @xmath56 .",
    "the reduction and purification of the geo@xmath55 was achieved with an efficiency of @xmath57 yielding @xmath58 kg @xmath3ge(6n ) for crystal production at canberra ( oak ridge ) , a total of 9 crystals could be pulled .",
    "the crystals were cut into 30 slices and sent to canberra ( olen ) where they were transformed into working bege detectors with a total mass of @xmath59 kg .",
    "all detectors have been characterized in the hades underground facility close to olen ; the relevant operational parameters including active volumes , dead layers and pulse shape performances have been defined .",
    "29 out of 30 detectors work according to specifications reaching full depletion with bias voltages below @xmath60kv and an energy resolution at @xmath61mev of @xmath62kev of fwhm when operated in a standard vacuum cryostat and standard canberra ge detector front end electronics @xcite . in a final step ,",
    "al pads for wire bonding were evaporated on the p@xmath51 and n@xmath51 substrates of each crystal . during all production steps ,",
    "the exposure of the enriched material to the cosmic radiation has been reduced significantly by shielded transport and underground storage of the material .",
    "the two main adavantages of using these detectors are the optimal energy resolution due to the very low input capacitance ( @xmath63pf ) and the powerful pulse shape discrimination .",
    "the particular position of the p@xmath51 and n@xmath51 contacts produces a non - uniform electrical field inside the bege detectors , allowing to discriminate the single - site ( like the @xmath0 ) from the multi - site events using the @xmath38 ratio : the sse events have a fixed @xmath38 and can be discriminate from the typical background events normally mse .      to provide a further background reduction a new holder for detectors , new contacts and new read - out electronics were implemented for phase ii .",
    "since the model of the gerda phase i background @xcite showed that a large fraction of the background is originated from sources close to the ge detectors , in phase ii most of the material close to the ge detector array were replaced by material of higher radio - purity and reduced mass .",
    "the phase i spring - loaded detector contacts have been replaced by wire bonded ones .",
    "moreover the new holder is made by a plate of @xmath64 g of mono - crystalline silicon which is intrinsically radio - pure .",
    "the silicon plate provides also the fixation of both the signal and the hv contacts .",
    "the test and commissioning runs showed that , for different reasons , many detectors had reverse current . many detectors were sent to canberra for groove passivation and the back - to - back detector mounting assemblies were modified to have the groove looking downward .",
    "this to prevent particles floating in the lar depositing and stay in the groove triggering the reverse current . as a consequence of the taken actions the fraction of detectors showing",
    "reverse current significanty decreased .    to take full advantage of the low input capacitance of the bege diodes and to accomplish the more stringent requirements in terms of radio - purity of the phase ii",
    "also the front - end electronics was improved .",
    "a new version of the charge sensitive preamplifiers , called cc3 , was developed for gerda phase ii @xcite .",
    "the new preamplifier cc3 is composed of two separate sections : the very - front - end ( vfe ) section ( fig . [ vfe ] ) , consisting of the preamplifier input jfet , the feedback components ( resistor and capacitor ) and the main section of the preamplifier , consisting of operational amplifiers , passive components and connectors .",
    "the vfe section is mounted very close to the detector to improve its performances .",
    "for this reason it must be extremely radio - pure : the input jfet is a commercial bare die ( sf291 ) connected with bonding wire , the discrete feedback resistors ( of @xmath65m@xmath66 ) is a 0402 smd ceramic package and the feedback capacitor ( @xmath67pf ) is a printed trace .",
    "the flexible vfe circuit has a coplanar waveguide tail to transmit the three relevant signal ( test , feedback and jfet drain ) from / to the cc3 .    the high mortality of the bare die jfets during the detector handling operations motivated to keep the phase i readout scheme , with the bf862 jfet close to the second amplifying stage located at @xmath64 cm ( @xmath68 cm ) above the top ( bottom ) detector in the string .",
    "the detector - csa contacts , the csa boards and the full coaxial cabling ( for ge , pmts , sipms ) have been redesigned and made out of new material with respect to phase i ; as result their @xmath69th , @xmath70u , @xmath71ra contents is reduced by a factor of 3 for the front - end devices and factor 10 for unit length of the coaxial cables .",

    "[ fwhm ] reveals that the beges energy resolution correlates to the detector position in the string , that in turn scales with the length of the detector to jfet contact .",

    "this is confirmed by the analysis of the fft noise spectra , not shown here : the white noise scales with the detector - to - jfet distance .",
    "detailed analysis is in progress to model and finally improve the noise .",
    "for the coaxials the same trend is not found : apart from individual detector peculiarities , this may be related to the different ratios of parasitic vs intrinsic detector capacity for the bege than for the coaxial detectors .",

    "all detectors are working and the performances of the first period of data taking indicate that the noise could be improved mitigating the parasitic sources ; this will improve both energy resolution and psd performances .    the gerda phase ii physics program is to take data for about three years in order to obtain @xmath78kg@xmath7yr of exposure and searching for the @xmath1ge   @xmath0   or improving both the half - life and the effective majorana neutrino mass limits , possibly attaining the top border of the neutrino masses inverted hierarchy region .",
