    "[ sec : intro ]    for helium cores more massive than about 30 @xmath0 , post - carbon burning stages are , initially at least , unstable @xcite .",
    "the production of electron - positron pairs at high entropy and temperatures over about @xmath4 k softens the equation of state , reducing the structural adiabatic index below 4/3 . roughly speaking",
    ", the creation of the rest mass of the pairs takes energy that might have gone into providing pressure support . a contraction to a higher temperature",
    "does not encounter as much resistance as it might have otherwise , and the star becomes unstable .",
    "this is the `` pair - instability '' @xcite .",
    "this instability results in a dynamical implosion of the helium and heavy element core which , provided the mass of that core does not exceed 133 @xmath0 , is reversed by nuclear burning @xcite . within this range of presupernova helium core masses , 30 - 133 @xmath0 , which corresponds to a larger , less certain range of main sequence mass of roughly 70 - 260 @xmath0 , ignoring rotation , a diverse range of outcomes is expected .",
    "helium cores above about 64 @xmath0  experience a single violent pulse that disrupts the entire star as a `` pair - instability supernova '' ( pisn ) .",
    "these events have been well studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in part because they are easy to simulate . unlike iron core - collapse supernovae , the explosion mechanism is well understood and easily calculated accurately in 1d .",
    "the major uncertainties lie instead with the formation and evolution of the progenitor stars .",
    "less well studied are the `` pulsational pair - instability supernovae '' ( ppisn ) powered by the `` pulsational - pair instability '' ( ppi ) . here , the nuclear flashes are not sufficiently energetic to disrupt the entire star .",
    "instead a series of pulsations occurs .",
    "the core contracts , ignites burning , typically of oxygen or silicon , expands and cools , then contracts and ignites burning again , either on a hydrodynamic time scale in low mass cores or on a kelvin - helmholtz time scale in higher mass ones . in the kelvin - helmholtz case , pulses , followed by cooling by radiation and neutrino emission ,",
    "recur until the mass and entropy of the helium and heavy element remnant become sufficiently reduced to avoid the ppi . as a result ,",
    "the final core masses converge on a relatively narrow range of values in the range roughly 35 - 50 @xmath0 .",
    "these remnants complete their lives , finishing silicon burning in hydrostatic equilibrium with no further pulsing activity and mass loss .",
    "the entire activity , from the onset of pulsations until the iron core collapses , can have a duration that spans many orders of magnitude , from a few hours to 10,000 years .",
    "though ppisn have also been extensively studied @xcite , these studies have not been as thorough and systematic as for pisn , and there is some confusion about how these explosions might appear .",
    "they certainly are not all super - luminous .",
    "very few light curves of pure ppisn ( i.e. , ppisn without an artificial core explosion ) have been calculated except for the 110 @xmath0  model of @xcite ; ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or parametrized representations thereof @xcite .",
    "other studies of light curves have considered only bare helium cores @xcite or assumed parametrized core explosions to calculate light curves @xcite .",
    "the latter violates the common assumption ( which may be wrong ;   [ sec : superl ] ) that the cores of stars that experience the ppi do not explode , but collapse into black holes .",
    "the recent discovery of gravitational radiation from merging intermediate mass black holes @xcite has also heightened the interest in the evolution of stars in this mass range @xcite , and offers new insights into their deaths .",
    "the present paper addresses these issues .",
    "the focus is on ppisn in metal poor stars ( 10% @xmath5  = @xmath6 ) , primarily as a way of suppressing , but not eliminating mass loss in the presupernova star .",
    "the key quantities of a ppisn progenitor are the mass of its helium and heavy element core and the mass and radius of its hydrogen envelope , if any , when the star first encounters the ppi , i.e. , at central carbon depletion .",
    "various choices of the uncertain mass loss rate can give similar values for these quantities for progenitors with different initial masses and compositions .",
    "for example , solar metallicity stars with greatly reduced mass loss rates also give very similar results .",
    "rotation , including the extreme case of chemically homogeneous evolution ( che ) , increases the helium core mass for a given main sequence mass and may affect the explosion mechanism , but otherwise gives similar outcomes .",
    "the same is true for stars in interacting binaries .    a large range of light curves results from explosions of differing pulsational power and interval . some are ultra - luminous , some are quite faint , and many are relatively normal type iip supernovae .",
    "the nucleosynthesis is unique , however .",
    "since it is usually assumed ( though see ",
    "[ sec : superl ] ) that the elements deep in the core all end up in a black hole , the new elements are restricted to lighter ones ejected in the pulses . he , c , n , and o are abundant and some ne , na , and mg are ejected , but little intermediate mass elements and no iron group elements . since the mass ejected experiences no nuclear processing during its expulsion , the results are similar to that obtained using an enhanced mass loss rate .",
    "when mixed with a small amount of matter from heavier pair - instability supernovae , the composition would be cno - rich , but very iron poor .    to begin , the physics of the ppi is briefly discussed .",
    "this includes both the physics used in the code (   [ sec : procedure ] ) , especially for mass loss , as well as a brief physical discussion of the operation of the ppi itself (   [ sec : taukh ] ) .",
    "since the outcome of the ppi depends critically upon the helium core mass ( actually the carbon - oxygen ( co ) core mass , which is almost the same , is a better discriminant ) , some time is spent (   [ sec : hecoreexp ] ) reviewing the outcome of instability and explosion in bare helium cores of constant mass .",
    "this has the advantage of removing some of the uncertainties in the mass loss rate , convection theory , rotation - induced mixing , and binary mass exchange which affect the final helium core mass as a function of main sequence mass .",
    "it also produces a set of models that are appropriate for hydrogen - stripped supernovae or for the products of che .",
    "surveys of helium core evolution have been done before @xcite .",
    "these differ in carrying a larger nuclear reaction network and providing a more thorough exploration of the observational outcomes .",
    "the discussion then moves to full star models calculated for a metallicity 10% that of the sun .",
    "a grid of masses is treated that spans the range in which the ppi is observed to occur in the stars without rotation or binary interaction , 70 - 140 @xmath0 , and shows the results of varying the uncertain mass loss rate (   [ sec : tmods ] ) .",
    "attention is paid to the bolometric light curves expected for stars of different masses .",
    "these turn out to include long , low luminosity red transients (   [ sec : t70 ] ) , ordinary type iip supernovae (   [ sec : t90 ] ) , long , irregular , luminous supernovae (   [ sec : t100 ] ) , recurrent supernovae , some ultraluminous (   [ sec : t110 ] ) , and long transients that are not ordinary supernovae , but essentially young supernova remnants with intense circumstellar interaction (   [ sec : t120 ] ) .",
    "two subsequent sections present a more limited grid of masses calculated for solar metallicity (   [ sec : solar ] ) and for low metallicity including rotation (   [ sec : rotate ] ) .",
    "these show that , with a dramatic reduction in mass loss , near solar metallicity stars are also capable of making ppisn .",
    "the rotating models show a shift downwards in the main sequence mass necessary to produce ppisn , and also show that the cores of the stars are rapidly rotating when they die , which may have interesting implications for the way in which they die .",
    "none of the conservative , `` first principles '' models considered here produce supernovae as bright as the brightest `` superluminous supernovae '' ( slsn ) .",
    "this may be surprising .",
    "most stay below 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 and emit less than @xmath7 erg of light , with only a few models briefly surpassing that luminosity .",
    "more speculative models are thus considered (   [ sec : superl ] ) in which rapid rotation launches at least a partial explosion of the star when the iron core collapses .",
    "the motivation is the observation in recent 2d and 3d simulations of mhd core collapse of jet formation .",
    "it may be that leaving a large black hole remnant and producing an energetic explosion along the rotational axis are not incompatible hypotheses .",
    "these are not relativistic jets and the explosions do not make gamma - ray bursts , though they are related . given the freedom to invoke rotationally - powered explosions _ and _ the ejection of large masses by the ppi , more luminous transients with smoother light curves are possible .",
    "the next section (   [ sec : etacar ] ) discusses the possibility that eta carinae is a ppisn in progress .",
    "the idea has appeal , but requires that eta carinae have been a more luminous supernova and a more energetic explosion some time in the past than most people presently believe .",
    "it offers the tantalizing prospect , however , that the main `` star '' in eta carinae is actually a wolf - rayet remnant experiencing kelvin - helmholtz evolution on its way to becoming a massive black hole .",
    "the nucleosynthesis expected from ppisn is then briefly reviewed (   [ sec : nucleo ] ) and the relevance of stars in this mass range for gravitational radiation briefly explored (   [ sec : gwave ] ) .",
    "  [ sec : conclude ] summarizes the principle conclusions of the paper .",
    "[ sec : mdot ]    the most uncertain aspect of thermonuclear ppisn is not how they explode , but how presupernova evolution produces the necessary helium core masses .",
    "mass loss , in particular , is critical .",
    "if the star loses all its hydrogen envelope and enough of its helium core to shrink below 30 @xmath0 , the pair - instability is avoided .",
    "this is probably the case for all stars of solar metallicity .",
    "mass loss in very massive stars is a subject of great interest and considerable uncertainty . generally speaking , for single stars",
    ", the mass loss is of three varieties : line - driven mass loss which dominates on the main sequence and for other hot stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; less well understood continuum driven mass loss and envelope instabilities which may play an important role in luminous blue variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and mass loss where grain formation is important , as in red supergiants @xcite . of these ,",
    "line - driven mass loss is most studied and best understood .",
    "analytic functions and routines are available to facilitate the use of such rates in computer codes .    the mass loss formula used here for the stars with hydrogen - rich envelopes is taken from @xcite . correcting a typo in the abstract , @xmath8 this formula",
    "is dated and of questionable accuracy , especially for the stars considered here , which lie far from the masses and metallicities for which the fit was originally calibrated , but the expression is simple and easily applied across the hr - diagram .",
    "it was adopted , but multiplied by various constants less than one to explore the sensitivity of outcomes .",
    "it was also multiplied by @xmath9 to approximate its scaling with metallicity . for hot stars with line - driven winds , a better",
    "scaling is @xmath10 or @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "given the limited metallicity range studied here , the difference could be accounted for by a small shift in the overall mass loss rate . for red supergiants",
    "whose winds may be driven by grain formation , the dependence on metallicity is not known .",
    "unfortunately , supergiant mass loss is important for many of the stars considered here .    using this formula and some simple approximations",
    ", one can estimate the necessary conditions for the pair instability to occur in stars that still retain some hydrogen envelope . because such massive stars all have luminosities near the eddington limit , their lifetimes on the main sequence are nearly constant at 3 million years , and their helium burning lifetime is close to 300,000 y ( i .. e . , the eddington luminosity divided by the energy release from hydrogen and helium burning assuming that the whole star burns ) . these numbers",
    "are validated later in the actual stellar models (   [ sec : tmods ] ) and are good to a factor of two .",
    "there is some trade off involved in that the luminosity is not quite eddington and the fraction of the hydrogen core that burns to helium is only about 3/7 . from 70 to 140 @xmath0",
    ", it turns out that the main sequence lifetime for non - rotating stars decreases from 3.3 my to 2.5 my and the helium burning lifetime varies from 330,000 to 270,000 y. the luminosities both on the main sequence and during helium burning are , at all times , within a factor of two of @xmath12 erg s@xmath3 . for hydrogen burning ,",
    "a more accurate approximation is @xmath13 erg s@xmath3 ; for helium burning , @xmath14 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the radius does not vary greatly on the main sequence , @xmath15 cm .",
    "the radius during helium burning does vary greatly , however , according to whether the star is a red supergiant , @xmath16 cm , or a blue one , @xmath17 cm .",
    "this variation introduces uncertainty into an otherwise estimate of the mass loss .",
    "together these considerations and the assumption m@xmath18 = 3/7 m@xmath19 , imply that a fraction of the hydrogen envelope @xmath20 will be lost to winds .",
    "here @xmath21 is the average radius of the star in 10@xmath22 cm units while burning helium . for solar composition @xmath23 ; for 10% solar metallicity @xmath21 varies from 0.3 to 2 but is usually closer to 2 .",
    "since @xmath24 must be less than one , this equation implies , for the approximate mass loss rate chosen , that no solar metallicity star will end its life as a ppisn ( or a pisn ) , but a large fraction of stars with metallicity below 10% @xmath5  might ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially if the metallicity scaling of @xcite is employed instead of z@xmath25 , or the mass loss rate of @xcite is an overestimate .",
    "this motivates the choice z = 0.1 @xmath5  for emphasis in the present survey .",
    "the uncertainty in this estimate is to be emphasized though .",
    "the mass loss rate implied for a 100 @xmath0  solar metallicity star with radius @xmath26 cm and luminosity 10@xmath27 @xmath28  using the analytic expression above would be 10@xmath29 @xmath0  y@xmath3 .",
    "for the same star , @xcite give a mass loss rate of @xmath30 @xmath0  y@xmath3 ( though the temperature here , 4500 k , may be too cool to apply the vink formula ) .",
    "@xcite estimate an upper limit to line - driven mass loss of @xmath31 @xmath0  y@xmath3 for a star of this luminosity ( though see * ? ? ? * for a different approach ) , and all of this theoretical work on line - driven winds neglects continuum driven processes , instabilities , and grain formation .",
    "the default mass loss rates employed here must then be considered uncertain to at least a factor of a few and probably overestimates .",
    "this affects the metallicity range where ppisn might occur , and even _ if _ they occur . to compensate for this uncertainty",
    ", the mass loss rates in this study are multiplied by various factors less than 1 .",
    "opacity , semiconvection , and rotation also play important indirect roles in determining the mass loss .",
    "less efficient semiconvection favors more time as a red supergiant and thus more mass loss .",
    "rotational mixing affects the composition of the hydrogen envelope and its opacity as well as the luminosity of the helium core .",
    "higher opacities favor a larger stellar radius and hence greater mass loss .",
    "the opal opacities used here @xcite have a well - known `` iron bump '' at low temperature that can lead to artificial density inversions in the outer envelopes of red supergiant stars @xcite",
    ". this tends to overinflate the star and thus boost its mass loss .",
    "all of these effects need further study .",
    "so long as the helium core is not uncovered prior to death , similar core masses and similar explosions , including e.g. , remnant masses , result",
    ". the exact value of the mass lost , as well as the secondary uncertainties in opacity , semiconvection and rotation , serve to define the observational properties of the presupernova star and the metallicities that can make ppisn . to first order",
    "though , they do not affect the explosion .",
    "it also may be that the stars rotate sufficiently rapidly to experience che in which case giant formation is avoided altogether and the formula of @xcite is not applicable .",
    "the treatment of mass loss for such stars is discussed in   [",
    "sec : rotate ] .",
    "[ sec : procedure ]    all stars and explosions were modeled using the kepler code @xcite .",
    "several modifications to the standard set up were necessary to follow these events which often made extreme excursions in density and temperature as they contracted , exploded , and then contracted repeatedly .    a nuclear reaction network of at least several hundred nuclei was directly coupled to the stellar model . use of the `` quasi - equilibrium '' and `` nuclear statistical equilibrium '' approximations was avoided . frequently , the cores would experience oxygen and silicon burning in their centers , producing a central region of iron , and then explode to low density and temperature , and then contract back to ignite silicon burning again later .",
    "it was important to follow the weak interactions during both the high temperature and high density burning and the long , cool phases where the temperature was often less than 10@xmath32 k and the quasiequilibrium network would have failed to converge",
    ". a small network would not have sufficed . in all cases the adaptive network approach proved stable and conserved mass to high accuracy .",
    "the network used was complete up to germanium ( z = 32 ) which is sufficient for following energy generation and electron capture .",
    "in several cases , the network was extended to bismuth to accurately track the weak s - process of nucleosynthesis .",
    "it was also important to follow convective mixing in the bound remnants , but not in shock wave or in the ejected shells which were being carried in the same simulation .",
    "convective mixing during the interpulse period affected the distribution of fuel for the next flash and needed to be included , but tracking convective mixing in a shock wave in the explosively ejected matter would have been both unphysical and unstable .",
    "convection extending all the way to the surface of any bound remnant gave that remnant an unphysically large luminosity during the interpulse period .",
    "the solution was simple .",
    "convection was turned off in all zones exterior to a few tenths of a solar mass beneath the final remnant .",
    "shells ejected to very large radii , greater than 10@xmath33 cm sometimes needed to be manually removed , especially when they became compressed and thin . resolving fine structure in both the distant shells and a collapsing iron core required a greater precision than the code was set up to handle .",
    "the effect of these distant shells on subsequent pulses was negligible , amounting to no more than a dense interstellar medium surrounding the star .",
    "all mass that was ejected had its composition and energy added to the totals .",
    "the opacity in the ejecta posed a special problem .",
    "the ejecting shells expanded to such low density that it was not on existing grids of stellar opacities .",
    "treatment of the bound - free and bound - bound opacities in the presence of large velocity shear would have posed special problems .",
    "the approximation made here was to employ only electron scattering opacity everywhere after the pulsations began , and to calculate the electron abundance with an accurate saha solver that included all ionization stages of 19 elements .",
    "an opacity floor of 0.001 to 0.01 @xmath34 g@xmath3 was also assumed to account very approximately for other low temperature sources of opacity besides electron scattering .",
    "this was important , for example , during the long interpulse periods when substantial matter fell back from an ejected shell and accreted , essentially at the eddington luminosity on the core .",
    "the luminosity of the core from this accretion was substantial .",
    "further work on low density opacity tables is needed .",
    "a special computational challenge was the ( unrealistic ) density spikes that developed when fast moving shells snowplowed into ones moving slower . in a 1d code , there was no way for mixing and overturn to occur , and no resistance to compression in regions with large velocity gradients , unless the density becomes so high that ideal gas pressure offered some resistance .",
    "the pile up often included a large fraction of the entire mass of the ejecta in a thin dense region all moving with the same speed . these density spikes",
    "could sometimes have a contrast @xmath35 with their surroundings of 10@xmath36 - 10@xmath37 . in a 2d study ,",
    "the pile up would still exist , but not with such great contrast @xcite .",
    "very tight convergence criteria on the radius ( as small as @xmath38 ) were necessary to keep the calculation stable and , even then , often failed .",
    "collisions of these thin massive shells sometimes produced unphysical spikes in the luminosity .",
    "[ sec : helium ]    many generic properties of ppisn can be understood from examining a grid of pure helium stars evolved to the supernova stage at constant mass without rotation .",
    "not only are the properties of ppisn most sensitive to the helium core mass at death , but in many cases the envelope of the star will have been lost , either to a binary companion or a wind , so these models should have observable counterparts in nature .",
    "che (   [ sec : rotate ] ) also produces stars whose evolution resembles that of bare helium cores .",
    "as we shall see , the explosion of such stars produces type ib and ic supernovae with variable properties , ranging from faint , fast blue transients to very luminous supernovae , and possibly long radio and x - ray transients .",
    "[ sec : taukh ]    in the weakest case , for the lightest helium cores less than about 36 @xmath0 , the ppi manifests as a small amplitude vibrational instability brought about by the temperature sensitivity of the nuclear reactions and the proximity of the structural adiabatic index to 4/3 .",
    "vibrational periods are about ten minutes , essentially the sound crossing time of the helium core . as the core mass increases or the abundance of nuclear fuel declines , however , the amplitude of these pulses increases and becomes non - linear .",
    "a major readjustment of the core structure occurs during each pulse that requires a kelvin - helmholtz time scale to recover .",
    "the most interesting explosions happen in this kelvin - helmholtz regime .",
    "there the characteristics of the ppi can be understood from an examination of the contraction , through its kelvin - helmholtz phase , of a helium star of constant representative mass .",
    "as we shall see , the most relevant mass range for the ppi is 30 to 65 @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : taukh ] shows the evolution of a 40 @xmath0  helium core in which nuclear burning , but not neutrino losses , has been suppressed .",
    "the evolution of a carbon or oxygen core of the same mass would be very similar .",

    "cores that have already burned some oxygen also bounce deeper and burn more , provided there is still fuel left to burn .",
    "explosive burning leads to rapid expansion and cooling .",
    "part of the energy released powers a shock wave that can eject matter from the edge of the core , but , qualitatively , the core s evolution is not altered , so long as its total mass stays roughly constant . after a brief period of large amplitude oscillation",
    ", the core settles back down into a new state of hydrostatic equilibrium at a less negative net binding energy and commences a new stage of kelvin - helmholtz contraction .",
    "the time until the next pulse depends on the net binding energy following the prior pulse . a pulse appreciably over @xmath46 erg in the 40 @xmath0  model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : taukh ] would completely disrupt the core producing a regular pisn .",
    "a pulse of @xmath47 erg , on the other hand , would put the star back into a state similar to what existed 10@xmath42 s earlier .",
    "of course , some energy would be lost to mass ejection , and the core entropy would change due to the burning and neutrino losses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ent50 ] ) , but qualitatively the evolution would be similar to the first contraction .",
    "the core explodes , stays bound , but relaxes to a less tightly bound configuration that experiences another stage of kelvin - helmholtz contraction until it becomes unstable again .",
    "the process repeats until all fuel is exhausted , the mass is reduced below a critical value , or the entropy lost from repeated kelvin - helmholtz episodes removes the instability .",
    "small explosions thus recur after a short time , while violent explosions have a longer recurrence interval .",
    "the interval between pulses is given by the energy of the prior pulse .",
    "violent pulses also burn more fuel , so there are fewer of them .    helium core contracting and experiencing the pulsational - pair instability .",

    ", this broad range of energies and time scales results in a diverse set of observable phenomena .",

    "superluminous supernovae are more easily produced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slsnlite],fig .",
    "[ fig : hyper ] ) .",
    "these events would not leave a magnetar remnant , however , and there would thus be no magnetar contribution to the light curve itself @xcite .",
    "it has been known for some time that normal pair - instability supernovae leave no bound remnants .",
    "a helium core over 133 @xmath0  is required for the production of a black hole , and for some range of masses below that no black hole is made , but how far down in mass does this void extend ?",
    "this study answers that question ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pisn will occur down to helium core masses of 64 @xmath0 , but the ppi will eject any mass in excess of 52 @xmath0  ( table [ tab : hecore ] , table [ tab : tmodels ] , and table [ tab : rmodels ] ) .",
    "a generation of bare helium cores or of che models that managed to span all masses at death would no produce any black holes between 52 and 133 @xmath0 , but what of stars that retain some hydrogen envelope ? there the answer is more nuanced and depends upon the mass loss rate , the effects of binary membership , and other possible mechanisms besides the ppi for removing the envelope at the time the star dies .",
    "consider model t70b ( table [ tab : tmodels ] ) for example , which has a helium core of 30.5 @xmath0  when it dies and thus avoids the ppi .",
    "will only the helium core collapse to a black hole , or will the hydrogen envelope participate in the collapse ? if the envelope collapses and there has been no mass loss , then a black hole of 70 @xmath0  could result .    more generally ,",
    "if the mass loss rate ( or metallicity ) is high , then the envelope will have little or no mass and the 52 @xmath0  limit will not be violated .",
    "if late time mass ejection @xcite removes the envelope , the limit also will not be violated .",
    "perhaps most relevant , since black hole mass determinations , including those from gravitational radiation , mostly come from interacting binaries , a companion star may have robbed the ppi candidate of its envelope , perhaps through common envelope evolution .",
    "this is particularly the case for systems that produce binary black holes that must merge in a hubble time by emitting gravitational radiation ( de mink , private communication ) .",
    "so probably , if the black holes seen in gravitational radiation experiments have been produced by the evolution of a single stellar system ( and not , e.g. , dynamical mergers in a dense cluster ) , they will exhibit the predicted gap from 52 to 133 @xmath0 .",
    "in reality , since 133 @xmath0  helium cores require extremely massive stars for their production ( 260 @xmath0 ? ) , the `` gap '' will probably be seen as a `` cliff '' above which no black holes are found in merging systems .",
    "in addition to limiting the range of black hole masses that exist in nature , the present study also limits the mass of @xmath90ni ejected in a core - collapse supernova . as table [ tab : hecore ] and table [",
    "tab : tmodels ] show there can be no co core mass bigger than 51 @xmath0  at the time of iron core collapse , even in stars that avoid the ppi , i.e. , the minimum of m@xmath92 and m@xmath264 .",
    "most likely these cores collapse to black holes , but even if they are artificially exploded with very high energy , the @xmath90ni production is limited .",
    "model he50 with a co core of 42 @xmath0  exploded with a central energy deposition of @xmath265 erg ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hyper ] ) only made 2.7 @xmath0  of @xmath90ni .",
    "it thus seems unlikely that credible models can produce more than about 4 @xmath0  of @xmath90ni without encountering the ppi and shrinking in mass first ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since the matter ejected in ppisn experiences no explosive nuclear processing , the nucleosynthetic yields are the same as if , towards the end of its life , the star had a very rapid mass loss rate .",
    "most of the elements heavier than magnesium , and all appreciable radioactivities , are left in the black hole .",
    "of course this assumes the implosion of the entire remnant to a hole and an axial explosion (   [ sec : superl ] ) would alter this conclusion .",
    "the nucleosynthesis for a representative set of non - rotating models is given in table [ tab : nucleo ] and shows the appreciable nucleosynthesis of helium and cno , with traces of neon and magnesium .",
    "one has to go to full pair - instability supernovae before the ejection of intermediate mass elements competes , in solar proportions with oxygen , and even then very little iron - group elements are made until the star s helium core exceeds about 90 @xmath0  ( stellar mass about 190 @xmath0 ) . at very low metallicity",
    ", rotating models will also copiously produce primary @xmath22n @xcite .",
    "a first generation of such stars might thus contribute a composition rich in either co or cno , with a trace of neon and magnesium and very silicon and iron poor @xcite .",
    "stars with this sort of composition have been seen @xcite .",
    "given that a single one of the more massive stars discussed here could produce , e.g. , 1% solar oxygen for thousands of solar masses of second generation stars , the nucleosynthetic role of pop iii ppisn deserves greater attention .",
    "this is an interesting topic for future work .",
    "this work , which spanned many years , has profited from conversations with many people , especially alex heger , nathan smith , jorick vink , selma de mink , and thomas janka .",
    "alex heger also contributed important parts of the kepler code that were necessary to this study , e.g. , the physics used in the rotating models , the adaptive network for nuclear burning , and many other features that made the code easier to use and the results easier to analyze .",
    "early on , the research was supported by the nsf ( arra ast-0909129 ) and by nasa ( nnx09ak36 g ) .",
    "more recently it has been supported solely by nasa ( nnx14ah34 g ) ."
