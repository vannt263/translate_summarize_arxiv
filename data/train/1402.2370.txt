    "relativistic jets are ubiquitous features of many accreting black hole and neutron star systems .",

    "it is commonly believed that jets are powered and collimated by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes ( lovelace 1976 ; blandford 1976 , 2000 ; blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",

    "black holes indicate jet production consisting of a poynting dominated ( in the sense that the energy is transferred predominantly by the electromagnetic field ) high lorentz factor spine , and a matter dominated , mildly relativistic sheath with @xmath2 possibly embedded in a sub - relativistic speed , @xmath3 , disk / coronal wind .",
    "note however , the that the lorentz factor can achieve a maximum in a tenuous boundary layer between a poynting - flux spine and a dense lower speed kinetically dominated sheath via rarefaction acceleration ( e.g , aloy & rezzolla 2006 ; mizuno et al .",
    "2008 ; zenitani et al . 2010a ; komissarov et al . 2010 ) .",
    "it is thought that relativistic jets on the largest scales are kinetically dominated , i.e. , most of the electromagnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy .",
    "the means by which magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy has not been identified , but it is generally thought to involve gradual acceleration by magnetic forces ( beskin & nokhrina 2006 ; komissarov et al 2007 , 2009 , 2010 ; tchekhovskoy et al .",

    "the large scale magnetic field may dissipate if the regular magnetic structure is destroyed as a result of a global mhd instability , the kink instability being the most plausible candidate ( lyubarskii 1992 , 1999 ; eichler 1993 ; spruit et al 1997 ; begelman 1998 ; giannios & spruit 2006 ) .",
    "the most promising mhd models for the acceleration and collimation of jets involve the presence of a magnetic field with foot points anchored to a rotating object ( an accretion disk or a spinning neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "the dominance of the toroidal component ( @xmath4 ) over the poloidal component ( @xmath5 ) is a natural consequence in these models .",
    "it is well known that current carrying plasma columns containing strong toroidal magnetic fields are unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations ( bateman 1978 ) . among these current - driven ( * cd * ) instabilities ,",
    "the kink mode is the most violent .",
    "the kink mode leads to helical displacement of the plasma - column and may disrupt the system .",
    "thus , non - linear development of the kink mode could trigger violent magnetic dissipation in relativistic outflows .",
    "mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) pointed out that when the kruskal - shafranov ( ks ) instability criterion , @xmath6 , for cylindrical force - free equilibria is applied to relativistic jets , the jets become unstable beyond the alfvn surface located at @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational radius , and where the jet radius @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , jet rotation and velocity shear significantly affect the instability criterion ( istomin & pariev 1994 , 1996 ; lyubarskii 1999 ; tomimatsu et al . 2001 ; narayan et al . 2009 ) and need to be studied in this context .    on the smallest scales , the rapid observed variability of x - ray / tev gamma - ray flares with timescales from several minutes to a few hours in blazars",

    ", helical structures may be attributed to the kelvin - helmholtz ( * kh * ) helical instability driven by velocity shear at the boundary between the jet and the surrounding medium ( e.g. , hardee 2004 , 2007 ; mizuno et al .",
    "2007 ) or triggered by precession of the jet ejection axis ( begelman et al . 1980 ) .",
    "it is still not clear whether cd , velocity shear driven , or jet precession is responsible for the observed structures , or whether these different processes are responsible for the observed twisted structures at different spatial scales .    in previous work , we investigated the temporal development of the cd kink instability using a periodic computational box . in mizuno et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we studied the instability of helically magnetized static plasma columns ( or more generally rigidly moving flows considered in the proper reference frame ) .",
    "simulation results showed that the initial configuration was strongly distorted but not disrupted by the cd kink instability .",
    "the growth rate depended on the radial profile of the magnetic pitch and the density .",
    "the plasma column was more unstable when the helicity of the magnetic field lines increased with radius ( magnetic pitch parameter , @xmath11 , decreased with radius @xmath12 ) and when the density decreased with radius . in mizuno",
    "et al . ( 2011 ) , we investigated the influence of velocity shear on the cd kink instability and found that the kink propagates along the jet with speed and flow structure dependent on the radius of the velocity shear ( hereafter called the velocity shear radius ) relative to the characteristic radius of the helically twisted force - free magnetic field . in mizuno",
    "2012 ) , we studied the influence of jet rotation and differential motion on the cd kink instability , and in accordance with linear stability theory , we found that development of the instability depends on the lateral distribution of the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "when the profile of the poloidal field is shallow , the instability develops slowly and eventually saturates .",
    "when the profile of the poloidal field was steep and the magnetic pitch in the inner portion of the jet was sufficiently small , i.e. , the magnetic field was sufficiently tightly twisted , multiple growing helical wavelengths disrupted the initial configuration .",
    "recently oneill et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have also investigated the cd kink instability in a local , co - moving frame using the 3d rmhd module within the athena code ( beckwith & stone 2011 ) .",
    "they also studied rotating jets with a purely toroidal magnetic field , the hoop stress being balanced by the gas pressure and centrifugal force , and found that the instability brings the system into a turbulent state .",
    "all of these results have been obtained using a periodic computational box that allows study of the temporal growth of a few axial wavelengths that fit within the small simulation domain .",
    "the time has come to begin systematic more physically realistic simulations that study the spatial development of cd instability .    in order to investigate the spatial development of the cd kink instability",
    "a non - periodic computational box must be used . at this time , only a few 3d simulations of relativistic , magnetized jets have been performed that study the spatial properties of the cd kink instability , and the results are still controversial .",
    "mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) simulated the generation and propagation of a relativistic highly magnetized jet and found no significant development of non - axisymmetric instabilities , even though the simulation satisfied the ks criterion for instability . on the contrary , mignone et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found strong jet distortion in their jet simulation .",
    "the discrepancy may be attributed to the difference in the setup .",
    "mignone et al . (",
    "2010 ) assumed that the magnetic field was purely toroidal , whereas mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) simulated jet launching from a rotating magnetized configuration and their jet contained both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components .",
    "recently , porth ( 2013 ) performed a simulation of relativistic jet formation from magnetospheres in keplerian rotation .",
    "the simulation showed development of the kink mode but the kink saturated before notable dissipation or disruption occurred .    in this paper ,",
    "we begin a systematic study of the spatial development of the cd kink instability in a relativistic jet via 3d rmhd simulations using a non - periodic computational box . in order to isolate the role of different factors and therefore to gain physical insight",
    "we do not attempt to properly account for poorly known relativistic jet poloidal and radial profiles . here",
    "we concentrate on the role of the velocity shear radius relative to the radius at which the toroidal component of the magnetic field is maximum and the radial density profile .",
    "we do not investigate the effect of a radial velocity or magnetic pitch profile in this study .",
    "we know that the temporal development of the cd kink instability is dependent on differential motion , the magnetic pitch profile , and the density profile ( appl et al . 2000 ; mizuno et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 , 2012 ) . our previous temporal growth simulations ( mizuno et al .",
    "2009 ) considered declining and constant density profiles with constant density profiles being slightly more stable . in order to compare spatial results to previous temporal results and",
    "to more closely simulate a high speed tenuous jet surrounded by a denser sheath or wind , we consider declining , constant and increasing density profiles . since temporal stability results ( mizuno et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 , 2012 ) indicate more substantial instability dependence on the magnetic pitch and velocity profiles that are unknown for observed relativistic jets , a choice of constant magnetic pitch and sharp velocity shear is reasonable for this first study .",
    "we describe the numerical method and setup used for our simulations in section 2 , present our results in section 3 , and in section 4 compare our results to instability expectations and conclude .",
    "we perform rmhd simulations of the cd kink instability using the 3d grmhd code  raishin \" ( mizuno et al . 2006 , 2011 ) .",
    "the code setup for spatial development of the cd kink instability is similar to the setup for temporal development in a periodic computational box outlined in mizuno et al .",

    "we use a non - periodic simulation box that is longer in the jet propagation direction .",

    "we impose outflow boundary conditions on all surfaces except the inflow plane at @xmath20 . in the simulations ,",

    "the radial profile of the magnetic pitch , @xmath26 , is determined by the pitch parameter @xmath25 , where smaller @xmath27 indicates increased helicity of the magnetic field lines . in the present simulations ,",
    "we choose a characteristic magnetic radius of @xmath28 ( the computational domain is @xmath29 ) , and we choose @xmath30 which gives constant magnetic pitch and magnetic helicity .",

    "we choose this radial gas pressure decline in order to keep the sound speed from exceeding the jet speed .",
    "this choice for the gas pressure means that we are not strictly in a static steady state equilibrium initial configuration .",

    "thus , relativistic magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , blackman & field 1994 ; lyubarsky 2005 ; watanabe & yokoyama 2006 ; zenitani et al . 2010b ; takahashi et al . 2011 ; zanotti & dumbser 2011 ; baty et al . 2013 ; takamoto 2013 ) associated with non - linear kink development is not treated .",
    "development of resistive relativistic mhd ( rrmhd ) codes are now one of the frontiers of relativistic mhd ( e.g. , komissarov 2007 ; palenzuela et al .",

    "we have developed an rrmhd code ( mizuno 2013 ) .",
    "the present and ongoing work using ideal mhd will be used to establish a baseline for comparison with cd kink instability work allowing for relativistic magnetic reconnection .",

    "<S> we have investigated the influence of velocity shear and a radial density profile on the spatial development of the current driven kink instability along helically magnetized relativistic jets via three - dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we use a non - periodic computational box , the jet flow is initially established across the computational grid , and a precessional perturbation at the inlet triggers growth of the kink instability . </S>",
    "<S> if the velocity shear radius is located inside the characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field , a static non - propagating current driven kink is excited as the perturbation propagates down the jet . </S>",
    "<S> temporal growth disrupts the initial flow across the computational grid not too far from the inlet . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the velocity shear radius is outside the characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field , the kink is advected with the flow and grows spatially down the jet . in this case flow </S>",
    "<S> is maintained to much larger distances from the inlet . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of different radial density profiles is more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> when the density increases with radius , the kink appears to saturate by the end of the simulation without apparent disruption of the helical twist . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior suggests that relativistic jets consisting of a tenuous spine surrounded by a denser medium with a velocity shear radius outside the radius of maximum toroidal magnetic field have a relatively stable configuration . </S>"
