    "<S> a subminiature mesoscopic cell , consisting of an asymmetric double quantum dot capacitively coupled to a nearby mesoscopic circuit , is proposed , which can transform disordered noise energy to ordered electric energy . </S>",
    "<S> two schemes , the noise originating from the nearby mesoscopic circuit and from the electromagnetic wave disturbance in external environment , are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the proposed cell can manifest as a good constant current source and the output current may not reach its largest value even if the circuit is shorted .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 73.40.gk , 73.50.lw , 73.50.td    mesoscopic physics , a new branch of condensed matter physics , has been developed and become an active field in the last two decades , not only because of the fundamental physics , but also because of the great potential as regards the new generation of electronic and photonic devices.@xcite very recently , by using inelastic transitions in a tunable two - level system,@xcite aguado and kouwenhoven proposed a detector of high - frequency quantum noise.@xcite this detector consists of a double quantum dot which is capacitively coupled to a nearby mesoscopic conductor . then from the inelastic current through the double quantum dots , one can measure the noise spectrum in the nearby conductor .    </S>",
    "<S> noise always exists in the electronic systems , whether johnson - nyquist noise in equilibrium states or shot noise in non - equilibrium states , and has been investigated extensively.@xcite in addition , a system usually exists in an electromagnetic environment from that the noise can also be induced in the system from the electromagnetic wave ( emw ) disturbance of the environment .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a subminiature mesoscopic cell , consisting of an asymmetric double quantum dot ( dqd ) and a noise offering circuit , capacitively coupled to a nearby mesoscopic circuit via capacitors @xmath0 ( fig.1(b ) ) , by which one can obtain the useful ordered energy from the disordered noise energy . in the proposed structure , the asymmetric dqd is described as a system of three tunnel barriers ( see fig.1(a ) ) with capacitances @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the impedance of the appliance load . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , the current noise @xmath3 of the noise offering circuit will give rise to the fluctuation of the electric potential of the two quantum dot,@xcite following the intro - dot energy levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 fluctuate too . </S>",
    "<S> this leads that the electron in the level @xmath5 of the right dot maybe absorb a quanta from the noise offering circuit and jump to the level @xmath4 of the left dot ( see fig.1(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a inelastic current goes through the dqd system from the right side to the left side . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that no battery exists in this device , but the system can produce ordered current , in other words , the system play a role of electric cell . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider that : ( 1 ) each dot of the dqd has only one electronic level , @xmath4 for the left dot and @xmath5 for the right dot , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the dqd is designed asymmetric to make the two levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 not in line . </S>",
    "<S> notice that no gate voltage applied in this dqd for controlling the intra - dot levels , different from the cases in ref .. ( 3 ) @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the chemical potential , so that the level @xmath9 is almost empty and the level @xmath5 is almost occupied by the electron . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) @xmath10 with @xmath11 the coupling between two dots.@xcite then the coherent tunneling between the two dots can be neglected,@xcite while the incoherent tunneling dominants , in which the photon emission or absorption to or from the environment may happen . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) let @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the tunneling rates through the left and right barriers , and @xmath14 the inelastic transition rate through the middle barrier . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider the situation with @xmath15  , i.e. , the middle barrier is much larger than left and right barriers . </S>",
    "<S> then the inelastic current through the dqd system ( from the right side to the left side ) is mainly decided by @xmath16.@xcite from perturbation theory , one can obtain this inelastic current as:@xcite @xmath17\\ ] ] @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the fermi distribution function in the left / right lead , @xmath20 is the temperature of dqd s system . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is related to the coupling strength @xmath21 by @xmath22@xcite and the probability @xmath23 for the exchange of energy quanta with the environment is given ( at @xmath24):@xcite @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the current noise spectrum at frequency @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) in the mesoscopic device , @xmath29 is the quantum resistance . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 is the trans - impedance connecting the dqd system and the noise offering circuit . for the circuit of fig.1(b ) , @xmath31 is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .    in terms of noise spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic current through the asymmetric qdq is : @xmath36 where @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the output current of the subminiature mesoscopic cell ( i.e. the current through the appliance load @xmath2 ) is equal to the current through the dqd . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate in detail the output current for the two schemes : ( i ) the noise originates from the equilibrium noise offering circuit itself . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the noise from the emw disturbance in a nearby external electromagnetic environment .    </S>",
    "<S> ( _ i _ ) _ the noise from the noise offering circuit_. in this case we assume that the noise offering circuit is not affected by emw disturbance in the external environment ; and the mesoscopic device is a quantum point contact ( qpc ) in equilibrium . then the noise spectrum @xmath38 can be expressed as:@xcite @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the conductance , @xmath41 is the temperature of the noise offering circuit ( or the qpc s system ) . in the numerical studies , we take relevant parameters as : ( 1 ) @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ; which are typical experimental values.@xcite ( 2 ) let @xmath46 , so as to satisfy the condition @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) set @xmath48 and @xmath49 . ( 4 ) let the qpc only has one open channel , leading to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> first , we investigate the case in which the circuit is shorted , i.e. @xmath51 , meanwhile @xmath52 . the output current @xmath53 vs. the temperature difference @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) at different @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> is presented in fig.2(a ) , showing an almost linear relation . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2(b ) shows the output current @xmath53 vs the energy difference @xmath57 , exhibiting a non - monotonous variation . in both limits of @xmath58 and @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath53 becomes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the position @xmath57 , at which @xmath53 has its maximum , is determined by @xmath60 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that @xmath53 is exactly zero if @xmath61 , regardless of the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is obviously consistent with the second law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one can consider the cell as a heat engine , which works between two heat reservoirs with the temperature @xmath41 and @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> ( _ ii _ ) _ the noise originates from the emw disturbance in the nearby environment_. in this case , we can assume that the temperature difference @xmath62 is zero , and the noise of the emw disturbance is the only source of the output current @xmath63 for simplicity we also assume that the noise spectrum @xmath38 from the emw disturbance is independent with @xmath64 , i.e. a white noise , @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in fig.2(b ) shows the output current @xmath53 vs. @xmath57 at the short circuit case . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly see that the output current @xmath53 is nonzero with the following features : @xmath53 is zero at @xmath66 , with the increase of @xmath57 , the difference of the occupation number becomes larger , leading to a larger current @xmath63 then @xmath53 reaches its maximum when @xmath57 at a certain value ( several times of @xmath67 . with the further increase of @xmath57 , @xmath53 decreases slowly , because that the transition from @xmath5 to @xmath4 becomes to very difficult at large @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> it is merit mentioning that : in order to obtain a greater output current @xmath53 , one can take different ways as : ( 1 ) to lower the temperature of the system , @xmath41 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) to change the noise offering circuit into a lc circuit with the condition of @xmath69 .    up to now , we have studied the output current @xmath53 at the short circuit case ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , in which the subminiature mesoscopic cell can produce a current @xmath53 , but its output power is zero . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we study the case of @xmath70 , in which the cell has a nonzero output power . since in this case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 and @xmath72 are nonzero , the output current @xmath73 has to be solved from eq.(3 ) and the equation @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3(a ) shows @xmath53 vs @xmath2 for case ( i ) . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that : ( 1 ) when @xmath75 varies from @xmath76 to a critical value @xmath77 , @xmath53 keeps almost independent with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that this cell is a good constant current source.@xcite the critical appliance impedance @xmath77 is also dependent with @xmath57 , and is approximately determined by @xmath78 : @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) when @xmath83 , the output current @xmath53 drops quickly with the increase of @xmath84 , quicker than @xmath85 .    </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the subminiature mesoscopic cell , @xmath86 is defined as the ratio of the output energy of the cell to the input energy from the high - temperature heat reservoir.@xcite neglecting external losses , one has @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the bias voltage across the appliance impedance @xmath84 . @xmath89 </S>",
    "<S> vs @xmath41 at different @xmath2 is shown in the inset of fig.2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the limit efficiency of heat engine , @xmath90 , is also shown by the dotted curve . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency @xmath91 monotonously increases with the temperature @xmath41 and the appliance impedance @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath89 can never excess @xmath92 , the efficiency of the ideal heat engine by the second law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> but the efficiency @xmath89 may still be quite high , e.g. at @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 ; which is close to the limit efficiency of heat engine , @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us study an interesting result . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that for the ordinary electric cell , the output current @xmath53 has its largest value if the circuit is shorted . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the proposal cell , the output current @xmath53 may be larger if the circuit is loaded ( @xmath70 ) than the circuit is shorted ( @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3(b ) shows @xmath98 vs. @xmath2 at very low temperature ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that @xmath53 is not the largest at @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath81 , the largest current @xmath53 is at @xmath101 , is not at @xmath102 . because that the current @xmath103 is directly proportional to the modulus square of the trans - impedance , @xmath104 , which also depends on @xmath2 ( see eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath2 increases , @xmath105 increases quickly in a certain range of @xmath2 , may lead to a larger current @xmath53 .    in summary , by using an asymmetric double quantum dots </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a subminiature mesoscopic cell , which can change the the disordered noise energy in a nearby mesoscopic device to the useful ordered electrical energy . </S>",
    "<S> two different cases of the origin of the noise are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the cell manifests a good constant current source and high efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> moveover , an interesting phenomenon , that the output current may have its largest value for the loaded circuit is discussed , which is important from the point of view of the application .    </S>",
