    "the motion of a quantum particle interacting with a surroundings particle gas is characterized by collision - induced decoherence as well as dissipation and thermalization effects . an appropriate master equation which provides a unified quantitative description of both phenomena in a mathematically consistent way",
    "is the quantum linear boltzmann equation ( qlbe ) , proposed in its weak - coupling form in @xcite , and in final form in @xcite .",
    "this equation represents the quantum mechanical generalization of the classical linear boltzmann equation which describes the motion of a distinguished test particle under the influence of elastic collisions with an ideal , stationary background gas .",
    "the qlbe may be derived on the basis of a monitoring approach @xcite which permits a non - perturbative treatment of the interactions with the environmental gas particles @xcite .",
    "these interactions may therefore be strong and the test particle may be in a state which is far from equilibrium .",
    "a condition for the applicability of the monitoring approach is that three - particle collisions are sufficiently unlikely , and that successive collisions of the test particle with the same gas particle are negligible on the the relevant time scale .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled in the case of an ideal background gas in a stationary equilibrium state .",
    "a further condition is that the interactions are short - ranged so that scattering theory may be applied .",
    "the mathematical structure of the qlbe is rather involved and analytical solutions of this equation are known only for some specific limiting cases @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spatially nonlocal structure of this equation makes a direct numerical integration through deterministic methods extremely demanding .",
    "however , being in lindblad form , the qlbe allows one to apply the monte carlo wave function techniques @xcite . as has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite these techniques lead to a simple and numerically efficient stochastic simulation method in the momentum representation of the test particle s density matrix , employing the translational covariance of the qlbe .    the simulation technique developed in @xcite",
    "is restricted to the qlbe within the born approximation @xcite , in which the scattering cross section depends only on the momentum transfer of the scattered particles , yielding a considerably simplified equation of motion . here",
    "we generalize this stochastic approach to the full qlbe allowing for an arbitrary form of the microscopic interaction between the test particle and the ambient gas particles and , thus , arbitrary scattering amplitudes .",
    "in addition , we show how the algorithm can be extended to simulate efficiently the dynamics of spatially localized wave packets .",
    "this enables the exact numerical treatment of many physically relevant phenomena , such as the loss of coherence in position space and the determination of the fringe visibility in interferometric devices , as well as the assessment of the quality of various approximations of the qlbe .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
