    "the degenerate parabolic equation @xmath0 arises in description of the evolution of the height @xmath1 of a liquid film which spreads over a solid surface ( @xmath2 ) under the action of the surface tension and viscosity in lubrication approximation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "lubrication models have shown to be extremely useful approximations to the full navier - stokes equations for investigation of the thin liquid films dynamics , including the motion and instabilities of their contact lines . for thicknesses in the range of a few micrometers and larger",
    ", the choice of the boundary condition at the solid substrate does not influence the eventual appearance of instabilities , such as formation of fingers at the three - phase contact line ( see @xcite ) . for other applications , such as for the dewetting of nano - scale thin polymer film on a hydrophobic substrate the boundary condition at",
    "the substrate appears to have crucial impact on the dynamics and morphology of the film .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 is related to the condition imposed at the liquid - solid interface , for example , @xmath4 for no - slip condition , and @xmath5 for slip condition in the form @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the horizontal component of the velocity field , @xmath8 is a non - negative slip parameter , and @xmath9 is the weighted slip length .",
    "distinguished are the cases @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the first one corresponds to the assumption of a no - slip condition , the second one to the assumption of a navier slip condition at the liquid - solid interface .",
    "the wetted region @xmath12 is unknown , hence the system is simulated as a free - boundary problem , where the free boundary being given by @xmath13 , i.e. the triple junctions where liquid , solid and air meet .",
    "the main difficulty in studying equation ( [ 0.0 ] ) is its singular behaviour for @xmath14 .",
    "the mathematical study of equation  ( [ 0.0 ] ) was initiated by f.  bernis , a.  friedman @xcite .",
    "they showed the positivity property of solutions to ( [ 0.0 ] ) and proved the existence of nonnegative generalized solutions of initial  boundary problem with an arbitrary nonnegative initial function from @xmath15 .",
    "more regular ( _ strong _ or _ entropy _ ) solutions have been constructed in @xcite .",
    "one outstanding question is whether zeros develop in finite time , starting with a regular initial data .",
    "what is known is that with periodic boundary conditions , for @xmath16 this does not occur @xcite , while for @xmath17 the solution develops zeroes in a finite time @xcite .",
    "one way of looking at the problem ( [ 0.1 ] ) has been to study similarity solutions to ( [ 0.0 ] ) in the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) . in the paper @xcite , the authors proved also existence dipole solutions and found their asymptotic behaviour .",
    "we note that the solutions of such type do not exist in the case @xmath20 , however , there exists a traveling wave solution ( see @xcite ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on a traveling wave solution to ( [ 0.0 ] ) at @xmath11 , namely , we consider the following problem with a regular initial function : @xmath21 system ( [ 0.1 ] ) describes the growth of dewetted regions in the film .",
    "fluid transported out of the growing dry regions collects in a ridge profile which advances into the undisturbed fluid ( see figure  1 ) . under ideal conditions",
    ", it could be imagined that dry spots could grow indefinitely large . by conservation of mass , the growing holes would shift fluid into the ever - growing rims . in our situation ,",
    "large length scale to limit the sizes of these structures is absent , and we might expect the motion and growth of the ridges to approach scale - invariant self - similar form . at the same time , the ridge profiles have a pronounced asymmetry ( see @xcite ) .    in the problem at hand , @xmath22 is the position of the former moving interface , i.e. the contact line , while the position of the latter interface will give an effective measure of the width of the ridge , @xmath23 .",
    "the ridge is assumed to be moving forward , @xmath24 , corresponding to an expanding hole .",
    "the arbitrary positive parameter @xmath25 corresponds to the contact angle of liquid - solid interface .",
    "thus , we can control a dewetted region in the film by the contact line and obtain asymmetry profiles of solutions . as the paper @xcite has shown that the axisymmetric profile can be analyzed within a one - dimensional thin - film model .",
    "the authors found matched asymptotic expansion , speed and structure of the profile , in particular , they obtained that @xmath26 where the asymptotic constant @xmath27 .",
    "hereinafter , we assume that the contact line moves with a constant velocity ( @xmath28 ) and the width of the ridge ( @xmath29 ) is a constant . as in @xcite , we are going to look for a solution to ( [ 0.1 ] ) in the following form @xmath30 we can remove v and @xmath25 from the resulted problem by rescaling appropriately , @xmath31 as a result , we obtain the following problem for the traveling - wave @xmath32 boatto et al .",
    "@xcite reduced this problem to the problem of finding a co - dimension one orbit of a second - order ode system connecting equilibria .",
    "hence generically solutions will exist but only for isolated values of the free parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 was found in @xcite by integration ( [ 0.2 ] ) , and @xmath34    our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we prove the existence and uniqueness of a traveling wave solution to the problem ( [ 0.2 ] ) ( theorem  [ th1 ] ) .",
    "lower and upper bounds for the traveling wave solution are contained in section  3 ( theorem  [ th2 ] ) .",

    "we find an absolute error estimate of approximation of a solution to ( [ 0.1 ] ) by the traveling - wave solution ( theorem  [ th3 ] ) .",
