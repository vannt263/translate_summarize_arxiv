    "the control of quantum superpositions in coupled electronic systems has been suggested as a possible way to realize quantum logic gates in semiconductor structures .",
    "an example are coupled quantum dots @xcite , where coulomb interactions between electrons can be exploited @xcite to define very small effective hilbert spaces such as that of two tunnel - splitted ground states , separated by a large energy gap from the remaining many - particle states@xcite .    if parameters of the hamiltonian ( like the tunnel - coupling between dots ) are slowly changed as a function of time , adiabatic control of the state vector @xcite , swap operations @xcite , and the controlled transfer from an initial to a final state @xcite become possible .",
    "in addition , by coupling such a system to external electronic reservoirs , one can pump electrons through the system in a controlled , adiabatic manner which in principle can serve as a ` read out ' of the state vector in form of an electric current . in the simplest case",
    ", this can be achieved through a simultaneous variation of two parameters as a function of time .",
    "both adiabatic control of rotations or swaps , and coherent pumping of electrons evidentally are very sensitive to decoherence .",
    "the coupling to dissipative degrees of freedom such as phonons disturbs the coherent time - evolution and therefore leads to a loss of control over the desired superposition .",
    "decoherence and dissipation in quantum xor gate operations have been discussed recently by thorwart and hnggi @xcite in a powerful numerical scheme .",
    "they found that properties like gate fidelities are very sensitive to the dissipative bath coupling constant , but only weakly depend on temperature .    in this article , we quantitatively investigate the role of dissipation for one- and two - qubit adiabatic ` rotations ' of an electron between two coupled quantum dots .",
    "for the electron charge one - qubit , we discuss a ` quantum electron pump ' for dots which are coupled to external leads ( electron reservoirs ) . in our scheme , decoherence is mainly due to absorption of bosons in excitations of the instantaneous ground state which leads to an exponential temperature dependence . for a sinusoidal pulse ,",
    "we use an exact solution and perturbation theory in the phonon coupling to predict how quantum mechanical oscillations between the dots can be made visible in a ` read out ' electronic current , similar to the experiment by nakamura _ et al . _ in a superconducting cooper pair box @xcite and the recent electron spin resonance scheme for dots by engel and loss @xcite .",
    "first , we compare results for both weak and strong coupling to the bosons and derive an analytic expression for the influence of the bath on the fidelity of the operation .",
    "second , we investigate two - qubit swap operations in spin - based two - electron quantum dots .",
    "these _ spin _ qubits sensitively depend on _ charge _ decoherence due to intermediate states where charge has tunneled between the dots .",
    "piezoelectric phonons coupled to the electron charge incoherently mix states in the singlet sector and lead to a loss of fidelity of the swap operation .",
    "adiabatic transfer and pumping of charges through small metallic islands or semiconductor quantum dots @xcite has already been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "furthermore , in the strong coulomb blockade regime of coupled quantum dots , the non - adiabatic coupling to ac fields in photo - assisted transport @xcite has been established in experiments @xcite . in the opposite regime of weak coulomb correlations , experiments in open dots",
    "@xcite have demonstrated the feasability of an ` adiabatic quantum electron pump ' .",
    "these systems can be described as non - interacting mesoscopic scatterers @xcite .",
    "a _ combination _ of strong coulomb blockade and the adiabatic control of the wave function in a triple quantum dot has been suggested recently @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in superconducting josephson junction qubits @xcite , adiabatic quantum computation with cooper pairs @xcite and adiabatic controlled - not gates for quantum computation have been proposed by averin @xcite .    the decoherence properties of adiabatic one- and two - qubit operations are closely related to the dissipative landau - zener problem ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite for further references ) . in time - dependent operations , decoherence rates in general become time - dependent themselves and therewith usually involve the whole ( or a large part ) of the spectrum of frequencies in the effective spectral density @xmath0 of the bosonic bath .",
    "as we show below , adiabatic pulses can be chosen such that qubit rotations run at a _ constant _ energy gap @xmath1 to the excited state whereby dissipation is due to @xmath2 , i.e. , one boson frequency only .",
    "this can be used to extract @xmath0 from the pump current by using a series of pulses with different @xmath1 .    a suppression of @xmath0 at certain frequencies",
    "@xmath3 has been predicted in free - standing ` phonon cavities ' due to symmetry and geometrical confinement @xcite . here",
    ", we demonstrate that a ` rabi ' rotation pulse tuned to constant energy difference @xmath4 effectively ` switches off ' the decoherence in such systems , at least within second order in the coupling constant .",
    "consequently , this defines a one - dimensional ` decoherence - free manifold ' ( curve ) on the adiabatic groundstate energy surface of the system , which might be of interest for adiabatic quantum computation schemes suggested recently @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section_one_qubit ] , we discuss one - qubit rotations , introduce the time - dependent spin - boson model , and describe the adiabatic transfer of an electron between quantum dots with and without dissipation . in section [ sectionfidelity ] , we derive a perturbative , analytical expression for the one - qubit fidelity , compare with the strong - coupling case , and suggest a scheme to extract quantum oscillations as a ` read out ' electron pump current . in section [ section_two_qubit ] , we turn to spin - qubit swaps and charge decoherence for the gate discussed recently by schliemann , loss , and macdonald . finally , section [ conclusion ] is a short conclusion .",
