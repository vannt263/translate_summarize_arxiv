    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism remains perhaps the most compelling explanation for the absence of cp - violating effects from the qcd vacuum structure  @xcite .",
    "an unavoidable consequence is the existence of the axion , the nambu - goldstone boson of a new u(1)@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "axions acquire a mass @xmath2 by their mixing with neutral mesons , where @xmath3  mev and @xmath4  mev are the pion mass and decay constant , and @xmath5 is a large energy scale related to the spontaneous breaking of u(1)@xmath1 .",
    "axions generically interact with hadrons and photons",
    ". they may also interact with charged leptons , the dfsz model  @xcite being a generic case .",
    "all interactions are suppressed by @xmath6 , so for large @xmath5 , axions are both very light and very weakly interacting . reactor and beam - dump experiments require @xmath7  kev @xcite , while precision cosmology excludes the @xmath8 range 1  ev300  kev @xcite .",
    "sub - ev mass axions would still be copiously produced in stars .",
    "the cooling of white dwarfs ( wds ) , neutron stars and supernova ( sn ) 1987a pushes the limits to @xmath9  mev @xcite , i.e.@xmath10  gev .",
    "we here explore the impact of axions near this limit , i.e.  the mev frontier of axion physics .",
    "this range is complementary to the other extreme of the allowed axion window . during the qcd epoch of the early universe",
    ", the axion field gets coherently excited , generating a cold dark matter ( cdm ) fraction of @xmath11 @xcite , where is the initial `` misalignment angle '' relative to the cp - conserving value . for @xmath12 , axions with @xmath13ev ( @xmath14  gev )",
    "provide all of cdm and can be detected in the admx experiment  @xcite . if the reheating temperature after inflation was large enough to restore the pq symmetry , our visible universe emerges from many domains and an average @xmath15 has to be used . in this case , axions also emerge from the decay of topological defects and the cdm density could correspond to @xmath8 as large as a few 100  @xmath16ev  @xcite . either way , mev - mass axions provide only a subdominant cdm component .",
    "the most restrictive astrophysical limits on those axion models that couple to charged leptons arises from wds . an early study used the wd cooling speed , as manifested in their luminosity function , to derive a limit on the axion - electron coupling of @xmath17 @xcite . in the early 1990s it became possible to test the cooling speed of pulsating wds , the class of zz ceti stars , by their measured period decrease @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , the star g117-b15a was cooling too fast , an effect that could be attributed to axion losses if @xmath19 @xcite . over the past twenty years",
    ", observations and theory have improved and the g117-b15a cooling speed still favors a new energy - loss channel  @xcite .",
    "what is more , the wd luminosity function also fits better with axion cooling if @xmath20@xmath21 @xcite .    while complete confidence in this intriguing interpretation is certainly premature ( perhaps even in the need for a novel wd cooling itself ) , the required axion parameters are very specific , motivating us to explore other consequences based on the wd benchmark .",
    "axion cooling of sne has been widely discussed in the context of sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "the 10  s duration of the neutrino burst supports the current picture of core collapse and cooling by quasi - thermal neutrino emission from the neutrino sphere .",
    "new particles that are more weakly interacting than neutrinos , such as the axions discussed here , can be produced in the inner sn core , leave unimpeded , and in this way drain energy more efficiently than neutrinos , which can escape only by diffusion .",
    "the sn  1987a neutrino burst duration precludes a dominant role for axions .",
    "quantitatively , this argument depends on the model - dependent axion - nucleon couplings , the uncertain emission rate from a dense nuclear medium , and on sparse data .",
    "as we shall see , the limit does not preclude the wd interpretation , but a sn would lose a significant fraction of its energy in the form of axions .",
    "the speed of neutron - star cooling as measured by the surface temperature of several pulsars  @xcite is another possible laboratory to search for axion cooling and a limit comparable to the sn  1987a bound was found  @xcite . however , neutron - star cooling depends even more dramatically on nuclear physics uncertainties and on the details of axion - nucleon coupling than the sn  1987a bound so that it is hard to make such arguments precise .",
    "however , if the wd interpretation applies , axion emission is another effect to be taken into account in the complicated theory of neutron - star cooling .",
    "returning to the energy loss of proto neutron stars after core collapse , axions saturating the sn  1987a limit are emitted as copiously as neutrinos .",
    "then one not only expects a strong axion burst from each sn , but also a large cosmic diffuse background flux from all past sne , the diffuse sn axion background ( dsab ) in analogy to the diffuse sn neutrino background ( dsnb ) @xcite .",
    "all past sne in the universe provide a local @xmath22 flux of order @xmath23 @xcite that will become detectable in a gd - enriched version of super - kamiokande  @xcite or a future large scintillator detector  @xcite with a rate of a few events per year .",
    "the estimated core - collapse rate is scaled to the amount of extra - galactic background light ( ebl ) , representing the integrated star - formation history  @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the ebl is 50@xmath24 , corresponding to an energy density of 13@xmath25 , i.e.  about 10% of the energy density provided by the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the present - day average core - collapse rate is @xmath26 and increases with redshift roughly proportional to @xmath27 until @xmath28 and then flattens or slightly decreases @xcite . assuming that every sn releases @xmath29  erg in the form of neutrinos of all flavors and integrating over @xmath30",
    ", properly redshifting the energy , leads to a present - day dsnb of @xmath31 , almost identical with the ebl .",
    "in other words , stellar populations release on average as much gravitational binding energy in the form of neutrinos as they release nuclear binding energy in the form of photons .    for mev - mass axions",
    ", therefore , the energy density of the dsab can be comparable to the dsnb and the ebl , and indeed would be the most important axion population in the universe .",
    "the axion losses of ordinary stars would contribute a much smaller energy density , just as the neutrinos emitted by all ordinary stars contribute an energy density of only about 7% of the ebl  @xcite .",
    "the dsab will be calculated in analogy to the dsnb where the @xmath22 spectrum as a function of present - day @xmath22 energy @xmath32 is given by the redshift integral @xmath33 \\bigr\\rbrace \\bigl\\lbrace r_{\\rm cc}(z)\\left|\\frac{dt}{dz}\\right|\\bigr\\rbrace\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the core - collapse rate .",
