    "the extreme inner galaxy ( eig ) has long been the subject of intense astrophysical study as it provides excellent opportunities to explore dynamics , phenomena ( from stellar to galactic scales ) and physical environments which do not exist in the large - scale galactic disk .    throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to the area inside of , and including , the 3kpc arms as the eig ( i.e. @xmath1 ) .",
    "` inner galaxy ' is a term already used to describe the areas of the milky way inside the solar circle , likewise the term ` galactic center ' ( gc ) usually refers to the relatively small area with a galactocentric radius less than a few hundred parsecs .",
    "useful reviews of the eig environment include @xcite and @xcite , who discuss the interstellar medium ( ism ) and structural components respectively .",
    "radio observations of the eig region have been performed since the 1950s ( using the dwingeloo 26 m antenna , * ? ? ?",
    "these early studies discovered large - scale hifeatures with non - circular motions @xcite , and concentrated on understanding these individual structures , or particular objects .",
    "the eig has been extensively observed in co. molecular tracers probe denser material than neutral hydrogen ( hi ) and co is readily observed , therefore co observations allow for analysis of regions in which the ism is concentrated into structures such as arms and bars @xcite .",
    "in contrast , observations of atomic gas trace diffuse interstellar clouds .",
    "while hiin the eig has been well studied at low resolutions , it is only recently that high - resolution hidata which cover the entire eig region have become available ( i.e. atca higalactic center survey ( higcs ) * ? ? ?",
    "these high - resolution hidata allow an analysis of the beginnings of the spiral arms ; the transition between orbits associated with the bar ; a comparison to high - resolution molecular observations , dynamical models and molecular transitions ; as well as investigations into the association of hiwith the galactic wind @xcite .    as a result of the variation in the temperature of interstellar hydrogen , hiemission and absorption spectra probe different phases of the ism . in most emission spectra",
    "it is the warmer components that dominate .",
    "however , cool gas is readily observed in absorption against background continuum sources , where it may be disentangled from warmer material along the line of sight .",
    "one advantage to studying hi absorption in the eig is that it probes this predominantly cool material , which tends to be more localised in space , and more closely confined to structural entities such as arms .",
    "previous hiabsorption studies have been vital to our understanding of the structure , rotation and the nature of atomic gas in the eig region .",
    "these include observations of absorption features associated with non - circular velocities , radio arc non - thermal filaments as well as particular objects including sgra * ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    while high - resolution hiabsorption measurements have been made towards several bright , or otherwise interesting , eig continuum sources ( *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) a complete hiabsorption study of the eig region has not been attempted .",
    "this present hiabsorption survey constitutes the most complete study of hiabsorption against the continuum emission from the entire sample of hiiregions known with @xmath0 .",
    "this study is only possible due to recent hiiregion discovery surveys ( which provide a list of target continuum regions with which to measure absorption against ) and improved resolution in hisurveys that include the gc region .",
    "in addition to providing a sample of bright continuum sources against which to measure hiabsorption , hiiregions also provide an important secondary tracer of galactic structure : the hiiregions themselves .",
    "galactic hiiregions are the formation sites of massive ob stars , which have a main sequence lifetime of @xmath2tens of millions of years . as a result",
    ", galactic hiiregions reveal the locations of current massive star formation , indicate the present state of the ism , provide a unique probe of galactic chemical evolution and are the archetypical tracers of galactic spiral structure @xcite .    in this work",
    "we measure hi absorption against only those hii regions with known radio recombination line ( rrl ) velocities .",
    "this sub - sample is discussed in section [ data ] , and the method of hi absorption is described in section [ hiabs ] .    we then summarise the known eig structures ( section [ gc ] ) and their locations in longitude - velocity ( @xmath3 ) space .",
    "we plot these structures on an ` @xmath3 crayon diagram ' , and use the diagram to consider the eig @xmath3 distribution of hiabsorption , in section [ hidist ] , and later for hiiregions ( section [ hiidist ] ) .",
    "we combine the results from sections [ hidist ] and [ hiidist ] to explore the galactic distribution of hiiregions ( section [ distances ] ) - through determining the lower limit of the line of sight distance to each hiiregion based on its hiabsorption profile and systemic velocity .",
    "finally , a discussion of individual sources appears as appendix [ individual ] .",
    "large scale , high resolution astronomical surveys are now publicly available in many wavelength regimes .",
    "this work uses large - scale hidata and radio continuum maps .",
    "radio continuum maps were sourced from the nrao vla sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nvss ) and the southern galactic plane survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sgps ) .",
    "the nvss covers 82% of the sky ( north of @xmath4 ) at 1.4ghz , resulting in 2326 4x4 degree continuum cubes of stokes parameters and a catalog of continuum emission sources .",
    "only the stokes i maps were used for this work .",
    "it should be noted that the nvss maps do not include zero spacing ( u , v ) information and therefore many , larger , diffuse emission regions , particularly those in the @xcite catalog , are not detected .",
    "for this work , hiabsorption spectra were extracted from the two sgps datasets ( @xmath5 ) and the atca higalactic center survey ( @xmath6 , higcs * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observations for the sgps ( i & ii ) and atca higcs were performed with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and supplemented with data from the parkes radio telescope .",
    "the three surveys provide continuous coverage of the inner galactic plane ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath22 resolution .",
    "catalogues of rrls provide systemic velocities for hiiregions .",
    "large - scale surveys of rrls from hiiregions were performed during the 1960 s to 1980 s .",
    "more recently , the green bank telescope hiiregion discovery survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gbthrds ) covered @xmath8 and detected rrls from 448 new hiiregions , effectively doubling the number known in that longitude range .",
    "the gbthrds is complete to 180 mjy at 9 ghz , and is able to detect all hiiregions ionised by a single o - star to a distance of 12 kpc .",
    "in addition , the gbthrds also includes a catalog of known hiiregions as of 2010 . for the @xmath0 region",
    ", this includes the combined works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gbthrds team carefully compiled this `` known '' catalog , removing duplicate sources through radio continuum and mid - infrared inspection .",
    "however they note that it is `` likely to contain some residual contamination and duplicate entries '' .",
    "the combination of this `` known '' catalog of hiiregions and the gbthrds source list , within @xmath0 , provided the sample list of regions for this work .",
    "both the gbthrds catalog and the compilation of previous catalogs can be found at .",
    "there are nearly 200 known hiiregions in the range @xmath9 with observed rrl velocities .",
    "hiabsorption spectra were extracted towards a total of 151 of these hiiregions ( see figure set [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the remaining hiiregions were either not visible in the nvss continuum maps ( also used by the gbthrds ) , usually diffuse hiiregions from the @xcite catalog , or hiiregions with coordinates that could refer to several continuum sources - see table [ table1 ] .",
    "therefore this study obtains hiabsorption spectra towards over 80% of known hiiregions with @xmath0 .",
    "the ` name ' for each hiiregion is taken from the rrl catalog from which it was sourced .",
    ".hiiregions that were _ not _ included in this work .",

( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal . ) [ fig3 ] ]      the co emission from both the near and far 3kpc arms is contained within @xmath10 @xcite , similar to the galactic latitude range of the hiiregions in this work ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "furthermore , both 3kpc arms are thought to span @xmath12 , which includes the whole longitude range of this work .",
    "therefore , if an hiiregion is located behind either of the 3kpc arms , hiabsorption should be visible at velocities pertaining to that arm .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] demonstrates that significant hiabsorption is seen toward the near 3kpc arm at all longitudes ; although there is a conspicuous gap in absorption at longitudes @xmath13 , consistent with a paucity of hiiregions for which to measure absorption towards .",
    "indeed 67@xmath14 hiiregions display absorption associated with the near 3kpc arm .",
    "there is less absorption associated with the far 3kpc arm than with the near ( @xmath15 ) , with the site of greatest absorption for the far 3kpc arm centered at @xmath16 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the disparity in the amount of hiabsorption may be an effect of the smaller latitude extent of the far 3kpc arm , which is particularly thin in the fourth quadrant @xcite .",
    "both the higcs and @xcite report a bifurcation in the velocities far 3kpc arm ( in @xmath3 space ) at @xmath17 .",
    "there is limited evidence of this bifurcation at longitudes extending to @xmath18 , the best example of this is in the absorption spectrum of g007.176 + 00.087 ( see figure set [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the near 3kpc arm also displays evidence of bifurcation , in both the hiemission and absorption , near @xmath19 ( see , for example , g358.616 - 00.076 , g358.623 - 00.066 , g358.633 + 00062 and g359.432 - 00.086 in figure set [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "however they excluded large regions of longitude , within @xmath0 , from the computation of the physical properties of each arm .    in order to investigate the locus of each arm in @xmath3 space ,",
    "a subset of absorption channels were selected for analysis ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we included all channels within @xmath21 ( between @xmath22 there is ambiguity between the 3kpc arms and the circular rotation velocities and for @xmath23 there is ambiguity with the tilted disk ) , which had velocities outside the envelope of allowed circular - rotation velocities ( i.e. @xmath24 km s@xmath20 ) and were not associated with either of bania s clumps .",
    "linear fits to these appear as equations [ nabs ] and [ fabs ] for the near and far arms respectively .",
    "near 3kpc arm : @xmath25    in both cases , the linear fits ( @xmath26 ) of the structure as given by hiabsorption are consistent with the @xcite fits from co emission ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .    ) , the fits from this analysis are displayed in green .",
    "( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal . )",
    "hiiregions provide radio continuum sources to measure hiabsorption toward , but they also provide a secondary tracer of the eig region - their own systemic velocities .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution of known hiiregions has previously been investigated by @xcite , however all hiiregions with highly non - circular motions ( i.e. those of interest to this work ) were excluded from their analysis .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution of hiiregion rrl velocity components used in this work is shown in figure [ fig5 ] - note : for hiiregions with multiple velocity components , all are shown .",
    "just as the distribution of hiabsorption was closely associated with known @xmath3 features in the eig region (  [ hidist ] , figure [ fig3 ] ) , the systemic velocities of hiiregions also trace these structures .    ) showing the distribution of hiiregion rrl velocity components.(a color version of this figure is available in the online journal . ) [ fig5 ] ]    the circular - rotation allowed velocities ( yellow envelope in ` crayon plots ' ) account for @xmath27 of the hiiregion rrl velocity components .",
    "@xcite , in a study of 6.7 ghz methanol masers near the eig , find the same velocity range accounts for @xmath28 of their sample .",
    "however , only @xmath29 of hiiregions with a single rrl velocity component are associated with eig features .",
    "a list of hiiregions with rrl velocities associated with an eig structure appears in table [ table3 ] .      until recently",
    ", it was believed that there are no known hiiregions inside of the 3kpc arms , except in the tilted disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite found no significant 6.7 ghz methanol maser emission towards the + 135 km s@xmath20 expanding arm , nor the connecting arm ; suggesting that the features are primarily gas that is not undergoing high - mass star formation .",
    "this is in - keeping with observations of other early - type barred galaxies which show star formation in the central nuclear region and at the ends of the bar , but not in the dust lanes along the bar @xcite .    using the collated hiiregion catalog of @xcite",
    ", @xcite found no hiiregions associated with structures outside the nuclear disk within @xmath31 .",
    "the gbthrds recorded rrl velocity components from 21 previously unknown hiiregions within @xmath31 , many ( especially in quadrant iv ) with non - circular velocities - these hiiregions are included in the target list of this work . however , as the @xcite study found , these new hiiregions are associated ( in @xmath3 space ) with the nuclear disk and looping ridge intersection .",
    "@xcite then investigated a wider longitude range , but could not identify any dust lane associated hiiregions .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite did not rule out the possibility of undetected ultra - compact hiiregions in the dust lanes .",
    "one diffuse hiiregion , g007.700 - 0.079 identified by @xcite ( but not included in the @xcite catalog used in the @xcite study ) appears to have one of its rrl velocity components associated with the connecting arm .",
    "there is also evidence of two 6.7 ghz methanol masers , tracers of current high - mass star formation , in the same part of @xmath3 space ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there are four hiiregion rrl velocity components associated with the + 135kms@xmath20 expanding arm and/or bania s clump 1 ( at @xmath32 km s@xmath20 ) , as well as two 6.7 ghz methanol masers from the methanol multibeam survey ( cited in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however only two of these regions have single rrl velocity components ( multi - rrl component hiiregions are probably the result of blending multiple emission sources along the line of sight ) .",
    "therefore there is evidence of some recent star formation in these structures .",
    "the other hiiregion of note is g002.611 + 0.135 as it is the only hiiregion that distinctly lies outside the `` crayon '' lines that delineate eig structures in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "@xcite suggest that g002.611 + 0.135 could be associated with either their structure j or ( see figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "the latitude of the hiiregion suggests a stronger association with clump 2 .",
    "only recently has there been evidence of significant star formation @xcite and large numbers of hiiregions @xcite in the 3kpc arms . in emission from molecular clouds the signatures of the 3kpc arms",
    "are clearly seen @xcite , but the gbthrds was unable to discover many new hiiregions , in either of the arms . however , both arms demonstrate high - mass star formation as traced by about fifty 6.7 ghz methanol masers @xcite .",
    "the certainty of associating hiiregions with the 3kpc arms ( in @xmath3 space ) is best in the longitude range of this study ( @xmath0 ) , as outside this limit the expected velocities of the 3kpc arms overlap with circular - motion spiral arm models and the association becomes more ambiguous @xcite .    inside @xmath0",
    "there are eleven hiiregion rrl velocity components consistent with the near 3kpc arm and two consistent with the far 3kpc arm .",
    "this small number of rrl components does not allow for a repetition of the analysis of  [ 3kpclocation ] using hiiregion rrl components rather than hiabsorption .",
    "the analysis of an hiabsorption spectrum towards a hiiregion can constrain the line of sight distance to the hiiitself .    due to the lack of a reliable rotation model for the inner @xmath23kpc of the milky way , kinematic distances to objects near , or in , the eig are the most difficult to ascertain . however",
    ", it should be possible to provide distance constraints for hiiregions with allowed circular rotation systemic velocities , using hiabsorption associated with eig features as approximate distance indicators .    in the inner galaxy , inside the solar circle",
    ", each velocity corresponds to two degenerate solutions for the kinematic distance - each equidistant from the tangent ( subcentral ) point .",
    "this kinematic distance ambiguity can be resolved in cases where hiabsorption is present at the velocity of a known structure - which indicates the hiiregion must be located behind the absorbing gas .",
    "the distance arrangement of eig features , listed in  [ gc ] , from the literature is assumed to be : near 3kpc arm , connecting arm , tilted disk , looping ridge , + 135 km s@xmath20expanding arm ( and bania s clump 1 ) , far 3kpc arm ( however not all structures are expected along any single line of sight , see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if hiabsorption is seen at velocities corresponding to a particular feature , the hiiregion must lie in , or beyond that structure . in this way",
    ", we use hiabsorption as an indicator of the lower limit of the line of sight distance , @xmath33 .",
    "the rrl velocity of an hiiregion also hints at its location , table [ table3 ] lists those hiiregions with systemic velocities beyond the range expected by circular rotation ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) and associated with eig feature(s ) .",
