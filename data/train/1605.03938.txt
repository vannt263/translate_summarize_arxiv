    "strongly lensed galaxies are very important in the study of galaxy formation and evolution because they permit derivation of important physical parameters such as the total mass of the lensing object , without any assumption on the dynamics .",
    "cases in which the einstein ring ( er ) is almost complete and the central lensing galaxy isolated are rare ; these permit constraining with great accuracy the enclosed mass within the projected einstein radius @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted several @xmath7 optical er to be detectable over the whole sky , down to a magnitude limit of @xmath8 and a lower limit for the enclosed mass of @xmath9 .",
    "this notwithstanding , despite extensive surveys ( see for example @xcite ) only a few tens of complete or nearly complete optical ers have been identified so far , and among these objects , only a few show a close similarity , in morphology and elongation of the ring , to the one we discuss in the present work .",
    "the first er to be discovered is the radio source mg1131 + 0456 @xcite .",
    "@xcite report the discovery of a partial er ( @xmath10 ) with @xmath11 ; the background oii emitting galaxy at @xmath12 is lensed by an elliptical massive galaxy at @xmath13 .",
    "this is the first known case in the literature of a er discovered at optical wavelengths .",
    "discovered an almost complete er ( @xmath14 ) with @xmath15 produced by a massive and isolated elliptical galaxy at @xmath16 . the source galaxy is a starburst at @xmath17 .",
    "then , a similar er to the one we report in this letter , in morphology , but not in the physics of the source galaxy , a bx galaxy , is the so called `` cosmic horseshoe '' @xcite ; the ring extension is similar to the one we report here , ( @xmath0 ) , but the einstein radius is double , @xmath18 ; the lensing galaxy has a huge mass of @xmath19 . other partial",

    "here we report the discovery of iac j010127 - 334319 , an optical , almost complete er , that we refer to as the `` canarias einstein ring '' , noticed as a peculiar object in decam images .",
    "no previous reference to the object has been found in the literature .",
    "subsequently we observed it with osiris@gtc for a spectroscopic confirmation of its nature . in this letter",

    "in order to confirm the lensing nature of this system we performed a spectroscopic follow - up at the @xmath2 m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) on roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , spain ) using the optical system for imaging and low - intermediate - resolution integrated spectroscopy ( osiris ) spectrograph .",
    "osiris has a mosaic of two e2v ccd42 - 82 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "all the obtained spectra were registered on the second detector , which is the default for long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "we used a binning of @xmath50 providing a pixel size of @xmath51 , and the grism r300b , which provides a spectral coverage of @xmath52  and a nominal dispersion of @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "the slit width was @xmath55 .",
    "long - slit spectral observations were performed on 2015 december 2 in good seeing conditions of @xmath56 .",
    "the slit was placed along the n - s direction , in order to minimize the effects of atmospheric differential refraction at culmination .",
    "the total exposure time was 3600 s divided into 6 exposures of 600 s each . in each of the 6 exposures",
    "the two components , ring and lensing galaxy , have been detected and in particular their spectra were not overlapping .",
    "the position of the slit was such that the spectra obtained for the ring refers to peak b.    for the pre - reduction we have used the osiris offline pipeline software ( oops ) ; sky subtraction and flux calibration were performed using iraf .",
    "we performed wavelength calibration using standard hgar+ne+xe arc lamps ; the resulting error on wavelength determination has been measured to be consistent with the above spectral resolution .",
    "we corrected the extracted spectra for instrumental response using observations of the spectrophotometric standard star gd140 , a white dwarf , obtained the same night .",
    "the fluxes of this standard star are available in @xcite .",
    "in order to derive the redshifts for the two components we noted the strong emission line in the source spectrum and the 4000  balmer discontinuity in the lens spectrum .",
    "this led us to choose template models for a starburst galaxy and a early - type galaxy respectively , as specified below . following line identification , we determined redshifts .          using the template spectra by @xcite results that the spectrum of the lens galaxy fits well the spectrum of a s0 galaxy ( see figure  [ fig : spec ] ) , a typical early - type galaxy characterized by a large increase in flux from the uv part of the spectrum to the optical .",
    "the @xmath57 balmer discontinuity at @xmath58 is noticeable .",
    "the redshift of the lens galaxy is @xmath59 and it has been determined from the measurements of : @xmath60 , ca k @xmath61 , ca h @xmath62 , @xmath63 , g - band @xmath64 , mg - b2 @xmath65 , mg - b1 @xmath66 ( marked red features from left to right in figure  [ fig : spec ] middle panel ) .      for the source galaxy we used the template spectra by @xcite and we found that the spectrum best fitting our observed spectrum corresponds to a starburst galaxy in the case of _ clumpy scattering slab _ , where it is assumed that clumped dust is located close to the source of radiation . in such circumstances ,",
    "@xcite show that scattering into the line of sight dominates over absorption by the dust , providing a significant positive contribution to the emerging radiation .",
    "this template spectrum fits well the strong @xmath67 emission line .",
    "we also identified the following lines : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , 11 @xmath70 , @xmath71,10 @xmath72 ( marked blue features from left to right in figure  [ fig : spec ] upper panel ) . according to these features , we derived for the source galaxy a redshift of @xmath73 .",
    "we note that the selected slit position enable us to extract only the portion of the spectrum corresponding to peak b ( see figure  [ fig : color ] ) ; this notwithstanding , the emission coming from the opposite side of the ring can be easily noted in our spectra .",
    "the strong circular symmetry of our object ( see figure  [ fig : color ] ) suggests that it can be approximated to the case of a circularly symmetric lens , with source and lens in the line of sight . under these assumptions , for an arbitrary mass profile @xmath74 , ( i.e. without assuming any particular model for the potential ) , we can apply the following relation @xcite and solve it for the mass .",
    "@xmath75    here @xmath76 is the einstein radius in radians ; @xmath74 is the mass enclosed within the einstein radius ; @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 are the angular diameter distances respectively of source - lens , lens - observer and source - observer .",
    "these last quantities are related to the relative comoving distances and , in general , this relation depends on the assumed curvature of the universe @xcite . in our case",
    "@xmath80 has been assumed and the resulting angular diameter distances are @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we calculated a total mass @xmath5 where the error on the mass ( @xmath84 ) is overwhelmingly due to the measurement error in the determination of the einstein radius , that we have estimated to be @xmath85 which corresponds to @xmath86 .",
    "the error on the redshift derives from the error estimated on the wavelength calibration which is @xmath87  .",
    "this value is consistent with the spectral resolution ( @xmath53  @xmath54 ) of the grating r300b that we used .    under the assumption of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) it is possible to give an estimate of the magnification of the ring : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the source size .",
    "from @xcite the average size of a starburst galaxy in our redshift range is @xmath90 kpc which corresponds to @xmath91 .",
    "the derived magnification is @xmath92 .",
    "we determined also the mass - to - light ratio of the lens in the @xmath93 band ; a k - correction of 2.1 has been derived for the lens using the ned calculator @xcite .",
    "the resulting ratio is @xmath94 .",
    "the former mass estimate can be improved by applying to the system a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model using the gravlens / lensmodel software @xcite .",
    "this software allows to fit a sie model using only the image positions and fluxes .",
    "the obtained best - fit model is plotted in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "the solutions have been derived for pointlike sources ; the ring shape is due to the fact that the source should actually be more extended with respect to the caustics than is shown here .",
    "the best fit ellipticity is @xmath95 calculated as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the axis ratio ; the associated position angle is -57 deg , angle measured from north to east .",
    "the best fit @xmath98 value is 6.12 , calculated setting to 0 the weights relative to image fluxes .",
    "the derived einstein radius is @xmath99 , which translates in an enclosed mass of @xmath100 , hence in excellent agreement with our previous estimate .",
    "we report the discovery of an almost complete ( @xmath0 ) circular optical einstein ring in the constellation of sculptor .",
    "the gravitational lens is a massive luminous red galaxy at @xmath101 .",
    "the source galaxy is a starburst at redshift @xmath102 ; its spectrum is dominated by a strong emission line . using these redshift determinations and the einstein radius @xmath103 we calculated the total enclosed mass that produced the lensing effect : @xmath5 .",
