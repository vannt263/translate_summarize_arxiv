    "in this tribute in honor of the memory of prof .",
    "herbert walther , we consider the possibility of extending his famous work on the trapping of an ordered lattice of ions @xcite in a paul trap @xcite , to the trapping of neutral atoms , and more generally , to the possible levitation of a macroscopic neutral polarizable object , in a purely electrostatic trap , for example , in the dc electric field configuration of a charged ring .  earnshaw s theorem will be extended to the case of such neutral objects , and we shall show below that the stable levitation and trapping of a neutral , polarizable object , which is a high - field seeker , is generally impossible in an arbitrary electrostatic field configuration .",
    "we shall do this first for the special case of the electrostatic configuration of a simple charged ring , and then for the general case of any dc electric field configuration .",
    "consider the charged - ring geometry shown in figure [ charged - ring - a ] .",
    "the region near the so - called levitationpoint @xmath0 in this figure is akin to the focal region of a lens in optics . just as two converging rays of light emerging from a lens in physical optics can not truly cross at a focus , but rather will undergo an avoided crossing  near the focal point of this lens due to diffraction ,  so likewise two converging lines of the electric field can not cross , and",
    "therefore they will also undergo an avoided crossing  near @xmath0 .",
    "there results a maximum in the @xmath1 component of the electric field along the vertical @xmath1 axis at point @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting avoided crossing  region of electric field lines in the vicinity of point @xmath0 is therefore similar to the gaussian beam - waist region of a focused laser beam .",
    "ashkin and his colleagues @xcite  showed that small dielectric particles , which are high - field seekers , are attracted to , and can be stably trapped at , such gaussian beam waists in optical tweezers .",
    "similarly here a neutral dielectric particle , which is a high - field seeker , will also be attracted to the region of the convergence of @xmath2-field lines in the neighborhood of @xmath0 , where there is a local maximum in the electric field along the @xmath1 axis .",
    "the question arises : can such a high - field seeker be _ stably _ levitated and trapped near @xmath0 ?",
    "the electric potential at the field point @xmath3 due to a charge element @xmath4 of the ring is given in by@xmath5where the distance @xmath6 from the source point , whose coordinates are @xmath7 , to the field point @xmath3 , whose coordinates are @xmath8 , is@xmath9(primed quantities refer to the source point ; unprimed ones to the field point ) . since the charged ring forms a circle of radius @xmath10 which lies on the horizontal @xmath11-@xmath12 plane,@xmath13    an infinitesimal charge element @xmath14  spanning an infinitesimal azimuthal angle of @xmath15 can be expressed as follows:@xmath16where @xmath17 is the total charge of the ring .",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless variables@xmath18thus@xmath19    due to the bilateral symmetry of the ring under the reflection @xmath20 , it is useful to sum up in pairs the contribution to the electric potential from symmetric pairs of charge elements , such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 with coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , shown in figure [ charged - ring - a ] .",
    "these two charge elements contribute equally to the electric potential @xmath25 if they span the same infinitesimal azimuthal angle @xmath15 .",
    "thus one obtains@xmath26along the @xmath1  axis , this reduces to the well - known result@xmath27the @xmath1 component of the electric field , which is the dominant @xmath28-field component in the neighborhood of point @xmath0 , is given by@xmath29along the @xmath1  axis , this also reduces to the well - known result@xmath30which has a maximum value at@xmath31the levitation  point @xmath0 then has the coordinates@xmath32neglecting for the moment the downwards displacement of a light particle due to gravity .",
    "the potential energy @xmath33 for trapping a neutral particle with polarizability @xmath34 in the presence of an electric field @xmath35 is given by@xmath36since the contributions to @xmath33 from the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of the electric field , which vanish as @xmath37 near the @xmath1 axis for small @xmath38 , can be neglected in a small neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "we now calculate the curvature at the bottom of the potential - energy well @xmath33 along the longitudinal @xmath1 axis , and also along the transverse @xmath11 axis .",
    "the force on the particle is given by @xmath39therefore the @xmath1 component of the force is , to a good approximation,@xmath40and the hooke s law constant @xmath41  in the longitudinal @xmath1  direction is given by@xmath42where all quantities are to be evaluated at @xmath0 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "taking the indicated derivatives and evaluating them at @xmath0 , one obtains@xmath45where the positive sign indicates a longitudinal stability of the trap in the vertical @xmath1 direction .",
    "the @xmath11 component of the force is , to the same approximation,@xmath46and the hooke s law constant @xmath47  in the transverse @xmath11  direction is@xmath48where again all quantities are to be evaluated at @xmath0 where @xmath43 and @xmath49 .",
    "again taking the indicated derivatives and evaluating them at @xmath0 , one obtains    @xmath50    where the negative sign indicates a transverse instability in the horizontal @xmath11 direction .",
    "similarly , the hooke s law constant @xmath51  in the transverse @xmath12direction is@xmath52where the negative sign indicates a transverse instability in the horizontal @xmath12 direction .",
    "note that the trap is azimuthally symmetric around the vertical axis , so that the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions are equivalent to each other .",
    "because of the negativity of two of the three hooke s constants @xmath53 , @xmath51 , and @xmath41 , the trap will be unstable for small displacements in two of the three spatial dimensions near @xmath0 , and hence @xmath0 is a saddle point .",
    "note also that the sum of the three hooke s constants in equations ( [ k_z]),([k_x ] ) , and ( [ k_y ] ) is zero , i.e. , @xmath54",
    "we shall see that equation ( [ sum - of - hookes - constants ] ) can be derived from earnshaw s theorem when one generalizes this theorem from the case of a charged particle to the case of a neutral , polarizable particle in an arbitrary dc electrostatic field configuration .  a quantitative consideration of the force on the particle due to the uniform gravitational field of the earth , in conjunction with the force due to the dc electrostatic field configuration , does not change the general conclusion that the mechanical equilibrium for both charged and neutral polarizable particles is unstable .",
    "we shall first briefly review here earnshaw s theorem stratton , which implies an instability of a charged particle placed into any configuration of electrostatic fields in a charge - free region of space in the absence of gravity .",
    "suppose that there exist a point @xmath0 of mechanical equilibrium of a charged particle with charge @xmath55 in the presence of arbitrary dc electrostatic fields in empty space .",
    "the potential @xmath25 for these fields obey laplace s equation@xmath56now the force on the charged particle is given by@xmath57where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the three unit vectors in the @xmath11 , @xmath61 , and @xmath1 directions , respectively . by hypothesis",
    ", at the point @xmath0 of mechanical equilibrium@xmath62_stable _ equilibrium would require all three hooke s constants @xmath47 , @xmath51 , and @xmath41 at point @xmath0  to be positive definite , i.e.,@xmath63however , laplace s equation , equation ( [ laplace s equation ] ) , can be rewritten as follows:@xmath64i.e . , the sum of the three components of hooke s constants for the charged particle must be exactly zero .",
    "the simultaneous positivity of all three hooke s constants is inconsistent with this , and hence at least one of the hooke s constants along one of the three spatial directions must be negative .",
    "therefore the system is unstable .",
    "the azimuthally symmetric field configurations like that of a charged ring is an important special case .",
    "let @xmath1 be the vertical symmetry axis of the ring .",
    "suppose that there is stability in the longitudinal @xmath1 direction ( such as along the @xmath1 axis above point @xmath0 ) , so that@xmath65by symmetry@xmath66so that equation ( [ sum - of - k s ] ) implies that@xmath67implying instability in the two transverse @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions .",
    "conversely , suppose there is instability in the longitudinal @xmath1 direction ( such as along the @xmath1 axis below point @xmath0 ) , so that@xmath68again , by symmetry@xmath66so that equation ( [ sum - of - k s ] ) implies that@xmath69implying stability in the two transverse @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions .",
    "the potential energy of a charged , massive particle in a dc electrostatic field in the presence of earth s gravitational field is@xmath70note that the term due to gravity , i.e. , the @xmath71 term , is linear in @xmath1 , and therefore will vanish upon taking the second partial derivatives of this term . therefore the hooke s constants @xmath47 , @xmath51 , and @xmath41 will be unaffected by earth s gravity .",
    "the force on the particle is@xmath72where @xmath60 is the unit vector in the vertical @xmath1 direction . in equilibrium , @xmath73 , but this equilibrium is again unstable , since upon taking another partial derivative of the term @xmath74 with respect to @xmath1 will yield zero , and therefore all of the above hooke s law constants are the same in the presence as in the absence of earth s gravity .",
    "now suppose that there exists a point @xmath0 of mechanical equilibrium of the neutral particle with positive polarizability @xmath75  somewhere within an arbitrary electrostatic field configuration .",
    "such a particle is a high - field seeker , and hence point @xmath0 must be a point of high field strength .",
    "choose the coordinate system so that the @xmath1 axis is aligned with respect to the local dominant electric field at point @xmath0 .",
    "thus the dominant electric field component at @xmath0 is thus @xmath76 .",
    "the potential energy @xmath33 for a neutral particle with polarizability @xmath34 in the presence of an electric field @xmath77 is given by@xmath36since the contributions to @xmath33 from the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of the electric field , which vanish as @xmath37 near the @xmath1 axis for small @xmath38 , can be neglected in a small neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "the force on the particle is@xmath39therefore the @xmath1 component of the force is , to a good approximation,@xmath40and the hooke s law constant @xmath41  in the @xmath1  direction is given by@xmath78where the last equality follows from the hypothesis of mechanical equilibrium at point @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11 component of the force is , to the same approximation,@xmath79and the hooke s law constant @xmath47  in the @xmath11  direction is given by@xmath80where the last equality follows from the hypothesis of mechanical equilibrium at point @xmath0 .",
    "similarly the @xmath12 component of the force is , to a good approximation,@xmath81and the hooke s law constant @xmath51  in the @xmath12  direction is given by@xmath82where again the last equality follows from the hypothesis of mechanical equilibrium at point @xmath0 .",
    "thus the sum of the hooke s law constants along the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath1 axes is given by@xmath83therefore@xmath84and again , the sum of the three hooke s law constants must be exactly zero according to laplace s equation .",
    "suppose that the system possesses axial symmetry around the @xmath1 axis with@xmath85i.e .",
    ", with stability along the @xmath1 axis . then by symmetry@xmath66so that equation ( [ sum - of - ks - for - neutral - case ] ) implies that@xmath86implying instability in both @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions .",
    "this is exactly what we found by explicit calculation for the case of a neutral , polarizable object near point @xmath0 of the charged ring .",
    "the potential energy of a neutral , polarizable , massive particle in a dc electrostatic field plus earth s gravity is@xmath87again , note that the term due to gravity , i.e. , the @xmath71 term , is linear in @xmath1 , and therefore will vanish upon taking the second partial derivatives of this term . therefore again",
    "the hooke s constants @xmath47 , @xmath51 , and @xmath88 will not be affected by earth s gravity .",
    "the force on the particle is@xmath89where @xmath60 is the unit vector in the vertical @xmath1 direction . in equilibrium , @xmath73 , but this equilibrium is again unstable , since upon taking another partial derivative of the term @xmath74 with respect to @xmath1 will yield zero , and therefore again all of the above hooke s law constants are the same in the presence as in the absence of earth s gravity .",
    "some known ways to evade earnshaw s theorem and thereby to construct a truly stable trap for charged or for neutral particles are ( 1 ) to use non - electrostatic fields such as a dc magnetic field ( e.g. , the penning trap @xcite ) in conjunction with dc electric fields , or ( 2 ) to use time - varying , ac electric fields , rather than dc fields ( e.g. , the paul trap @xcite ) , or ( 3 ) to use active feedback to stabilize the neutral equilibrium of a charged particle in a uniform electric field , such as was done for a charged superfluid helium drop @xcite , or ( 4 ) to use the low - field seeking property of neutral , diamagnetic objects to levitate them in strong , inhomogeneous magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the latter two methods may be practical for levitating the superfluid helium millikan oil drops  in the experiment described in @xcite ."
