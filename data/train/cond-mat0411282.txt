    "mixtures of colloidal particles and non - adsorbing polymers dispersed in a solvent provide experimentalists and theoreticians with a very flexible model system to explore the statics and dynamics of phase transitions , including fluid  fluid demixing , crystalization , gelation or glass transitions@xcite , as well as the interfacial properties associated with phase coexistence .",
    "the flexibility of this model system stems from the fact that its properties can be easily tuned by varying , among others , the size ratio of the two components ( e.g.  by controlling the degree of polymerization ) , their concentrations , or the quality of the solvent which determines whether the polymer coils behave essentially like interacting self  avoiding walks ( saw ) , or more like ideal non  interacting polymers ( under @xmath0solvent conditions ) .",

    "the profiles are compared to earlier predictions based on a square gradient density functional ( sgt ) @xcite , using the same effective one  component description .",
    "there are remarkable differences between the profiles corresponding to interacting and ideal polymers .",
    "the interface is much sharper in the latter case and exhibits striking oscillations on the high colloid density ( liquid \" ) side  @xcite .",
    "the profile obtained with interacting polymers varies more smoothly , and shows no sign of oscillations . this clear  cut difference in behaviour may be partly understood by noting that the jump in colloid density between the two fluid phases is significantly smaller in the case of interacting polymers , for which the triple and critical points are much closer than for ideal polymers .",
    "figures  [ ff_lou ] and [ ff_ao ] also show the result of our earlier square gradient calculations ( sgt ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding profiles agree reasonably well with the results of the more elaborated density functional used in this paper ; as expected the square gradient functional can not account for the oscillatory structuring on the dense fluid side in figure  [ ff_ao ] .    in the case of interacting polymers ( figure  [ ff_lou ] )",
    "the width of the interface predicted by the present perturbation dft is significantly larger than that obtained from square gradient theory . the interfacial width @xmath172 is conventionally defined as the distance between the two points where the density profile @xmath121 reaches 90% and 10% of the difference between the bulk densities of the two coexisting phases .",
    "results for @xmath172 obtained within the perturbation dft are plotted in figure  [ ff_w ] as a function of the deviation of the polymer reservoir packing fraction from its value at the critical point , @xmath173 , for ideal and interacting polymers and for three size ratios @xmath60 . as expected",
    ", the width increases with @xmath60 and increases sharply as @xmath174 decreases , i.e.  upon approaching the critical point .",
    "although the widths @xmath172 for ideal and interacting polymers are rather close for given @xmath174 and @xmath60 , polymer interactions tend to reduce the width compared to the ideal case , as found in @xcite .",
    "the surface tension @xmath63 of the fluid ",
    "fluid interface is given by a relation similar to eq  [ gammadft ] , and it is easily verified that the bulk terms @xmath28 and @xmath131 in eq  [ omegagrand ] do not contribute to @xmath63 .",
    "the relation reads : @xmath175 -\\rho_c(z)\\mu_c^0 + p_c\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 and @xmath176 are the common values of the colloid contribution to the chemical potential and of the pressure in the coexisting bulk phases .",
    "figure  [ ff_gamma_ao ] compares results obtained from the perturbation and square gradient theories for ideal polymers , at three different size ratios ; @xmath63 is plotted versus the difference between the colloid packing fractions in the liquid `` and gas '' phases .",
    "the surface tensions are seen to increase with @xmath60 and @xmath177 .",
    "the agreement between the two theories is excellent for @xmath178 , and deteriorates for smaller size ratios .",
    "the surface tensions obtained from perturbation dft are systematically larger than their square gradient counterparts and closer to the results of the two  component dft of ref  @xcite .    a comparison between the surface tensions calculated within perturbation dft for ideal and interacting polymers is finally made in figure  [ ff_gamma ] .",
    "the surface tension is seen to be lowered when polymer interactions are included , a trend which is opposite to that observed for the wall surface tension @xmath179 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ gammaw10 ] ) .",
    "a fluid - fluid interface also implies an inhomogeneous polymer density profile . for ideal polymers at constant @xmath22",
    "this does not cost any additional free - energy , but this is not true for interacting polymers . for the latter depletant",
    ", this correction will raise the surface tension compared to the values we calculate within the one - component picture . on the other hand , for ideal polymers",
    ", the many - body interactions between the colloids , fully taken into account with the two - component formulation , also result in a larger surface tension .",
    "the effect of many - body interactions for interacting polymers is unknown .",
    "thus our prediction for the relative strength of the surface tensions should be tempered by the fact that the exact form of the neglected corrections is not know and awaits a full two - component treatment of interacting polymer - colloid mixtures .",
    "we have introduced a simple generic density functional description of colloid  polymer mixtures within the effective one  component picture where polymer degrees of freedom have been traced out .",
    "the free energy functional accounts correctly for the colloid excluded volume effects , and treats the polymer  induced depletion attraction within first order perturbation theory .",
    "the dft formulation is very flexible and can be applied to confined colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures as well as to the free interface between coexisting fluid phases .",
    "although this effective one  component description accounts only for pair  wise additive depletion interactions , and neglects more  than  two  body effective interactions ( which are automatically included in an effective two  component representation ) , the present theory has the advantage of being able to treat the cases of ideal as well as interacting polymers consistently , thus allowing a direct estimate of the effect of polymer interactions on the interfacial properties of colloid  polymer mixtures . the present effective one  component dft description can be tested against the more fundamental two  component dft picture in the case of ideal polymers@xcite .",
    "reasonable agreement is found for size ratios up to @xmath180 , giving confidence in the predictions of the simpler one  component representation for ideal and interacting polymers alike .",
    "the reduction to an effective one  component representation leads to the appearance of zero and one  body bulk contributions to the total grand potential of the mixture ( terms @xmath28 and @xmath131 in eq  [ omegagrand ] ) , which make significant contributions to the wall surface tension @xmath179 and to the depletion interaction between two walls , and must not be overlooked .",
    "the key findings of the present investigation may be summarized as follows :    * density profiles @xmath121 near a hard wall deviate considerably from pure hard sphere behaviour at low colloid packing fractions .",
    "significant differences between the behaviour observed for ideal and interacting polymers may be traced back to the weaker depletion attraction induced by the latter .",
    "* when the bulk terms @xmath28 and @xmath131 in the grand potential are properly taken into account , the wall surface tensions @xmath179 calculated with ideal polymers are in good agreement with a recent full two  component treatment of the ao model@xcite , for @xmath181 and not too high colloid packing fraction @xmath182 . *",
    "the depletion potential induced by colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures between two walls exhibits structure on both length scales @xmath18 and @xmath21 which opens the possibility of further flexibility in engineering \" effective depletion forces . * in general ,",
    "the wall surface tension @xmath179 induced by mixtures of colloids and interacting polymers is larger than that found for ideal polymers .",
    "this trend is opposite to that predicted for the fluid",
    " fluid interfacial tension .",
    "the present predictions agree at least qualitatively with the experimental data of ref  @xcite , and may be understood in terms of the wall surface tension of the pure polymer component . *",
    "the present effective one  component dft predicts an oscillatory density profile on the high colloid density side of the fluid ",
    "fluid interface in the case of ideal polymers sufficiently close to the triple point ; this behaviour agrees with the earlier prediction based on the effective two  component ( ao model ) representation@xcite . the oscillations are not observed in the case of interacting polymers , presumably due to the smoother variation ( larger width ) of the interfacial profile . *",
    "a direct comparison between the results of square gradient analysis@xcite and the present more sophisticated dft shows that the former is surprisingly accurate , even for rather sharp fluid ",
    "fluid interfaces ( except , of course , as regards the oscillatory behaviour observed for ideal polymers ) .",
    "the good agreement validates the predictions of the simple square gradient theory concerning the effect of polymer  polymer interactions on the fluid  fluid interfacial properties@xcite .",
    "the present effective one  component description predicts a number of significant differences between interfacial behaviour of mixtures of colloids and ideal versus interacting polymer coils . the corresponding two  component representation involving ideal polymers ( i.e.  the ao model ) is well established , and confirms many of the predictions of the present effective one  component picture .",
