    "with the ability of creating exponential number of superposition of states , quantum computation provides an unprecedented computational power over classical computation .",
    "for example , shor s factoring algorithm  @xcite , the harrow - hassidim - lloyd ( hhl ) algorithm  @xcite , and other progresses in quantum simulation  @xcite provide strong evidences that quantum computation can gain exponential speed - up in practical problems .",
    "apart from computational decision problems , quantum devices can be exploited for other classically - intractable computational tasks , including sampling distributions of some quantum systems  @xcite . as a result , one may expect to gain  quantum supremacy \"  @xcite in relatively - simple quantum devices in the near future .",
    "although these results are promising , complete and rigorous proofs for supporting the claims of gaining quantum supremacy are still unavailable .",
    "recall that for the case of shor s algorithm , we have not excluded the possibility for the existence of a polynomial - time classical algorithm for the factoring problem . for the hhl algorithm , which is -complete , it remains to determine if quantum computation is indeed more powerful than classical computation , or technically , if it is true that @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the success of the sampling algorithms is founded on several conjectures in the theory of classical computational complexity .",
    "even though boson - sampling devices are capable of creating an exponential number of superposition of quantum states , the transition amplitudes can still be estimated by classical devices within additive errors  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , query complexity , which counts the number of queries of black - box functions ( i.e. , without the knowledge of the internal structure ) , provides further evidences supporting quantum speed - up over the classical counterparts .",
    "for example , grover s search algorithm  @xcite , the deutsch - jozsa algorithm  @xcite and simon s algorithm  @xcite are all characterized in the context of query complexity .",
    "recently , aaronson and ambainis @xcite introduced a new concept in query complexity , called forrelation , which characterizes the multi - fold correlations among different boolean functions .",
    "it was found that a quantum computer is capable of solving 2-fold forrelation problems within a constant @xmath1 number of queries . however , classical computers require an exponential number of queries .",
    "the difference between the query complexity between quantum and classical methods is shown to be a maximally - achievable separation with quantum methods ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore ,",
    "multiple - fold forrelation problems are as hard as quantum computation  @xcite , i.e. , -complete .    .",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are query operators that map states @xmath5 to @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 respectively , where@xmath9 .",
    ", width=377 ]    here we report the first experimental study of the 2-fold and 3-fold forrelations in a system of nuclear spins , where the nmr quantum circuit of 2-fold forrelation involves only 2 queries of the black box functions , but classically , it takes a total of 8 queries for an exact result .",
    "similarly , 3 queries are needed for the nmr implementation of 3-fold forrelation , while 12 queries are needed classically if memory is given for the black - box functions ; otherwise it can go up to 192 classical queries .",
    "however , we note that the measurement results come directly form the nmr signals , but a standard implementation of the quantum circuit involves probabilistic measurement outcomes . furthermore , similar to other experimental demonstrations of deutsch - jozsa algorithms  @xcite ,",
    "the applied nmr pulse sequences depends on the knowledge of the functions , which are not strictly  black boxes \" .",
    "therefore , the current experimental results can not be taken as a direct proof for demonstrating quantum supremacy , which is relevant only in the large-@xmath10 limit .",
    "the purpose of the experiment is to investigate whether a small - size prototype experiment can produce forrelation within the accuracy required for demonstrating the quantum advantages ( above the threshold @xmath11 or below the threshold @xmath12 ) , given the current technology and in the presence of experimental noise . in particular",
    ", our experimental fluctuation for the spin measurement has to be controlled within @xmath13 .",
    "these experimental results allow us to identify the places one can improve for scaling up the size of the experiment in future .",
    "given @xmath14 boolean functions , @xmath15 , each with @xmath16 variables , i.e. , @xmath17 , the @xmath14-fold forrelation , @xmath18 , of these functions is defined as follows , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 indicates the bitwise inner product between the @xmath16-dimensional binary vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the total number of possible assignment is @xmath24 .",
    "essentially , @xmath25-fold forrelation is simply the inner product between a boolean function and fourier transformation of another boolean function , i.e. , @xmath26    importantly , an exact determination of 2-fold forrelation @xmath27 is a computationally - hard problem for classical devices , which can be justified by the following challenge  @xcite : given a pair of boolean functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , suppose it is known that either ( i ) @xmath30 or ( ii ) @xmath31 is true , all classical methods require an exponential number @xmath32 of queries to the black - box functions , but the quantum computers can finish the task with a constant number of queries .",
