    "in a magnetic field parallel to the surface of a type ii superconductor , the nucleation of superconductivity @xcite near the surface is known as `` surface superconductivity '' .",
    "it is characterized by a third critical field @xmath2 which is higher than the second critical field @xmath3 of the superconductor .",
    "e.g. , for a plane superconductor - insulator interface , the value of the third critical field is given by @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for magnetic fields between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , a superconducting sheath appears near the surface .",
    "its thickness is of the order of the temperature - dependent coherence length @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that the effect of surface superconductivity becomes increasingly important with decreasing dimensions of the samples , in particular when the volume of the near - surface layer becomes comparable to the total volume of the sample . in this case",
    "one might expect that the magnetic - field behavior of the mesoscopic superconductor is determined by the third critical magnetic field @xmath6    however , not only the volume , but also the sample geometry plays a crucial role in mesoscopic superconductors .",
    "the presence of several plane surfaces or of a curved surface with a small radius of curvature ( substantially smaller than @xmath7 ) , enhances the superconductivity . as a result , critical fields in mesoscopic structures even _",
    "@xmath2 , as will be shown below theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the nucleation of superconductivity at magnetic fields above @xmath2 was first studied in a wedge @xcite .",
    "technological progress in the last two decades enabled the manufacturing of mesoscopic superconducting structures with sharp corners , and resulted in a renewed interest in the problem of superconductivity in a wedge .",
    "for instance , recent investigations on superconductivity in a wedge with a small angle @xmath8 using a variational approach @xcite or the adiabatic approximation devr , kfdm , revealed that strongly localized distributions of the order parameter dominate at @xmath9 . also , states of the superconducting phase with integer numbers ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) of confined circulating superconducting currents have been found @xcite in wedges with a sufficiently small angle ( @xmath13 ) . within the framework of numerical solution of the gl equations in a wedge @xcite , the critical magnetic field for @xmath14",
    "was found to be approximately equal to @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , strong enhancement of the superconductivity has been demonstrated experimentally in al mesoscopic squares and square loops , by measuring the temperature dependence of the midpoint of the normal - to - superconducting resistive transition @xcite .",
    "the phase boundaries obtained in this experiment lie in a region of substantially higher magnetic fields than the phase boundary for bulk al .",
    "the numerical solution of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations revealed @xcite spatially inhomogeneous distributions of the order parameter in a mesoscopic square loop , and the resulting superconducting phase boundary in a square loop with leads @xcite turns out to be in agreement with the experimentally observed phase boundary @xcite .",

    "a smooth transition from a multivortex superconducting state to a giant vortex state with increasing both the disk thickness and the magnetic field has been found for thin disks @xcite . the flux penetration and expulsion in thin superconducting disks",
    "have been analyzed @xcite . in ref .",
    ", the saddle points or energy barriers have been obtained , which are responsible for some metastabilities observed in mesoscopic superconducting disks . on the basis of the linearized gl equations ,",
    "dimensional crossover in a mesoscopic superconducting loop of finite width has been studied @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a dimensional transition occurs if the film thickness is of order @xmath17 similar to the 2d-3d transition for thin films in a parallel magnetic field .",
    "vortex states in superconducting rings with out - of - center location of the opening have been recently discussed @xcite .",
    "superconductivity near the surface of a superconductor can still be enhanced if it is surrounded by a medium with a higher transition temperature than the one of the sample .",
    "the vortex structure of thin mesoscopic disks with this type of enhanced surface superconductivity has been considered in ref .  .",
    "the magnetic field versus temperature phase diagram was obtained , and the regions of existence of the multivortex state and of the giant vortex state were found . in ref .",
    "the enhancement of the superconductivity near the surface of a mesoscopic superconductor was studied , due to both the surrounding medium and the curved surface of the sample .",
    "all the above - mentioned superconducting structures can be described by 2d ( wedges , thin disks , squares and square loops ) or quasi-3d ( if the thickness of a sample is effectively taken into account ) , or even 1d ( double loop in a network approach ) gl equations .",
    "another kind of mesoscopic superconducting systems , which radically differs from the above structures , is a cone ( or , more generally , a conoid ) .",
    "superconducting properties of a cone can not be described by 2d gl equations with an `` effective thickness '' of the sample . instead , the gl equations in a cone have to be solved in a general 3d form .",
    "our interest in the problem of superconductivity for a conic structure was induced by recent experiments @xcite with a nanosized pb bridge , which is formed between a substrate and the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope .",
    "the shape of the bridge is close to a geometrical figure consisting of two cones linked by their apexes .",
    "the diameter of the bridge varies from a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers .",

    "for the fields ranging from 0 to approximately @xmath144 , the bridge is superconducting and has zero resistance .",
    "the resistive superconducting - to - normal transition is characterized by a range of fast changes in the interval @xmath144 to @xmath165 , followed by a range of slow changes for higher fields .",
    "the above - mentioned fast changes are explained by a fast reduction of @xmath82 in the regions near the bases of the bridge with increasing applied magnetic field .",

    "the contribution of the states with @xmath122 to the resistive superconducting - to - normal transition in the mesoscopic bridge is , however , relatively small as compared to the state with @xmath91 .    in summary ,",
    "the resistive superconducting - to - normal transition as a function of applied magnetic field is characterized by a fast change in some range of relatively low applied magnetic fields and by a slow change for higher fields .",
    "this behavior is explained by an inhomogeneous distribution of the superconducting phase in the bridge .",
    "the fine structure appears in the resistive superconducting - to - normal transition as a function of applied magnetic field , when the states with @xmath122 are taken into account .",
    "as discussed above , the diameter of the bridge varies along the @xmath69-direction from a few nanometers in the neck ( @xmath93 ) until about 23 nanometers near the bases .",
    "this suggest that , given the applied magnetic field and the temperature , superconducting states characterized by various @xmath18 are realized in different parts of the bridge . in this section , we analyze the possibility of existence of such vortex states . for this purpose",
    ", we calculate the free energies of the states with various vorticities for disks of different radii .",
    "the radii of the disks are chosen to coincide with those of cross - sections of the bridge in the @xmath150-planes at different values of @xmath69 .",
    "the results of the free energy calculations are shown in fig .",
    "9 . for sufficiently large disks [ fig .",
    "9(a ) , @xmath167 that corresponds to 24 nm in the case of the pb bridge ( ref .  ) at @xmath88 ] , the states characterized by different @xmath18 are possible for various applied magnetic fields .",
    "the transition @xmath169 takes place at about @xmath170 for the temperature @xmath88 [ fig .",
    "9(a ) ] . for disks with smaller radii",
    ", this transition occurs at higher values of the applied magnetic field [ figs .",

    "is realized in the considered range of applied magnetic fields [ fig .",
    "9(e ) ] .",
    "using the obtained plots ( fig .",
    "9 ) , we can find the radii of the disks at which a transition @xmath171 occurs for different values of the applied magnetic field .",
    "for @xmath103 the transition @xmath172 turns out to take place in a disk with diameter @xmath173 [ 18 nm for the pb bridge ( ref .  ) at @xmath88 ] , shown in fig .",

    "9(c ) , the state @xmath91 is realized . for the areas between the bases of the bridge and the disk [ fig .",
    "9(c ) ] , the state @xmath146 is energetically favored .",
    "thus , there are three competing states : the state with @xmath91 all over the bridge [ fig .  10(a ) ] , that with @xmath146 all over the bridge [ fig .  10(b ) ] , and also the vortex state characterized by a _ varying vorticity _",
    "@xmath174 in the direction of the bridge s axis [ fig .",
    "we have calculated the free energies for these states .",
    "the calculations show that the state @xmath174 with varying vorticity has the smallest free energy .",
    "the value of the free energy for this state is about 50 per cent lower than for the state @xmath146 .",
    "however , the free energy for the state @xmath174 is only 2 per cent lower than that for the state @xmath91 .",
    "hence , in the bridge under consideration the state @xmath91 is a reasonable approximation for a wide range of applied magnetic fields .",
    "comparison in fig .",
    "8c between the resistance calculated for thermodynamically equilibrium states involving different numbers @xmath18 , on the one hand , and the resistance calculated only for the state with @xmath91 , on the other hand , confirms this conclusion .",
    "but to describe the fine structure of the superconducting - to - normal resistive transition [ fig .",
    "8(b ) ] , the states with @xmath122 have to be taken into consideration .",
    "we have solved the _ three - dimensional _ ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations in a mesoscopic superconducting multi - conoidal structure with cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the calculations have been performed for a geometrical body , which is restricted by six conoidal surfaces and two base plane surfaces .",
    "this body is a model of a pb nanosized superconducting bridge between a scanning tunneling microscope tip and a substrate @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that the distribution of the superconducting phase in the bridge is strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "superconductivity in the bridge is suppressed by increasing the applied magnetic field .",
    "this suppression occurs first near the bases of the bridge . in a region near the neck of the bridge ,",
    "superconductivity survives to much higher magnetic fields than the surface critical field @xmath2 . at high magnetic fields this neck region",
    "is separated from the bases by regions of the normal phase .",
    "we have also studied the suppression of superconductivity in the bridge by increasing temperature .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath82 decreases along with a redistribution of @xmath82 in the bridge .",
    "this redistribution is characterized by a concentration of the superconducting phase near the neck of the bridge with a relative reduction of @xmath82 away from this central region .",
    "we have analyzed the superconducting states in the bridge from the point of view of the thermodynamical stability .",
    "the free energy of the superconducting states has been calculated as a function of the applied magnetic field . for a wide range of applied magnetic fields ,",
    "the state @xmath91 is realized in the bridge .",
    "this range widens with increasing temperature .",
    "the superconducting - to - normal resistive transition is studied in detail as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "we have shown that a switching from the superconducting to the normal regime occurs in a wide interval of applied magnetic fields of the order of @xmath175 and depends on temperature .",
    "for example , for @xmath88 , the resistive transition starts at about @xmath144 and reaches the midpoint at about @xmath165 .",
    "this agrees with the experimental data according to which superconductivity in the bridge has been detected at @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "it is shown , that the main contribution to the superconducting - to - normal resistive transition is determined by the state with orbital angular momentum @xmath91 . when states with higher @xmath18 are taken into account",
    ", a fine structure appears in the transition , which reflects the effect of the fluxoid quantization in the bridge .    in the bridge ,",
