    "a _ network _ , in the simplest terms , is a collection of points in some space ( e.g. on the euclidean plane ) , called _ nodes _ or _ vertexes _ , and a collection of node pairs , called _",
    "edges_. the presence of an edge between two nodes indicates that they can directly communicate with each other .",
    "the mathematical name for this network model is _",
    "graph_.    a class of networks that has recently attracted particular interest in the wireless communication context , is called _ ad - hoc networks_. it is distinguished by the fact that the network nodes are not subject to any regular ( say periodic ) geometric emplacement in the space but can be rather seen as a snapshot of some _ random point pattern _ , called also _ point process _ ( pp ) in the mathematical formalism typically used in this context .",
    "connectivity , i.e. possibility of indirect , multi - hop , communication between distant nodes , is probably the first issue that has to be addressed when considering ad - hoc networks .",
    "an ubiquitous assumption when studying this problem is that the node randomness is modeled by a spatial _ poisson _ pp .",
    "this latter situation can be characterized by independence and poisson distribution of the number of nodes observed in disjoint subsets of the space .",
    "poisson assumption in the above context is often too simplistic , however analysis or even modeling of networks without this assumption is in most cases very difficult .    in this paper",
    "we introduce some class of point processes that might be roughly described as exhibiting less variable point patterns than poisson pp .",
    "we call point processes ( pp s ) of this class _ sub - poisson point processes_. our objective is two - fold .",
    "on one hand we want to argue that this class of pp s allows to extend some classical results regarding network connectivity and on the other hand we want to bring attention to sub - poisson pp s , as they might be useful for modeling of ad - hoc networks , whose nodes are more regularly distributed than a poisson  pp .",
    "a random variable is called sub - poisson , if its variance is not larger than its mean ( with the equality holding true for poisson variable ) . intuitively ,",
    "if strictly sub - poisson variables were to describe the number of nodes in different subsets of the space then the resulting point patterns would exhibit less clustering ( or bunching ) than the poisson point pattern having the same number of points per unit of space volume .",
    "this in turn , still intuitively , should have positive impact on the connectivity and perhaps capacity and other network performance metrics , the reason being that the perfectly regular , periodic patterns are commonly considered ( and sometimes can be proved ) as being optimal .",
    "the aim of the present article is to provide rigorous results on the comparison of the connectivity and capacity properties of certain sub - poisson networks to these of the respective poisson networks .",
    "the statistical variability of random variables ( say with the same mean ) can be compared only to some limited extent by looking at their variances , but more fully by convex ordering . under this order one can compare the expected values of _ all _ convex functions of these variables . in multi - dimensions",
    "there is no one single notion of convexity . besides different statistical variability of marginal distributions , two random vectors ( think of number of nodes in different subsets of the space )",
    "can exhibit different dependence properties on their coordinates .",
    "the most evident example here is comparison of the vector composed of several copies of one random variable to a vector composed of independent copies sampled from the same distribution . among several notions of `` convex - like '' ordering of random vectors the so called _ directionally convex _ ( @xmath0 ) order , allowing one to compare expectations of all @xmath0 functions ( see section  [ sec : dcx_defns ] below ) of these vectors , takes into account both the dependence structure of random vectors and the variability of their marginals .",
    "it can be naturally extended to random fields by comparison of all finite dimensional distributions , as well as to random ppas and even locally finite random measures by viewing them as non - negative fields of measure - values on all bounded borel subsets of the space ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "using this latter formalism , we say that a pp is _ sub - poisson _ ( or simply _ sub - poisson _ when there is no ambiguity ) if it is @xmath0-smaller than a poisson pp having the same mean measure , i.e. , the mean number of nodes in any given set .",
    "we will also say _ sub - poisson network _ in the case when the nodes of the graph modeling the network are distributed according to some sub - poisson pp .",
    "we shall also see that there are classes of pp whose so - called _ joint intensities _ ( densities of the higher order moment measures , when they exist ; see section  [ ss.intensities ] ) are smaller than those of poisson pp",
    ". using this latter ( and weaker ) property we define the class of _ weakly sub - poisson point processes_.    another weakening of the comparability assumption , to the expectations of increasing ( or decreasing ) @xmath0 functions allows to define _ increasing @xmath0 _ sub - poisson pp s , which can be seen as being less variable than some poisson pp having possibly smaller ( or larger ) mean measure .",
    "we shall abbreviate increasing @xmath0 by @xmath1 and similarly _ decreasing _",
    "@xmath0 by @xmath2 .",
    "our choice of the @xmath0 order to define sub - poisson pp s has its roots in  @xcite , where one shows various results as well as examples indicating that the @xmath0 order implies ordering of several clustering characteristics known in spatial statistics such as ripley s k - function or second moment densities .",
    "namely , a pp that is larger in the @xmath0 order exhibits more clustering ( while having the same mean number of points in any given set ) .      full connectivity ( multi - hop communication between any two nodes ) of an ad - hoc network with many nodes is typically hard to maintain , and so , a more modest question of existence of a large enough , connected subset of nodes ( called component ) is studied .",
    "a possible approach to this problem , proposed in  @xcite , and based on the mathematical theory of _ percolation _ , consists in studying existence of an _ infinite _ ( called _ giant _ ) _ component _ of the infinite graph modeling a network .",
    "existence of such a component is interpreted as an indication that the connectivity of the modeled ad - hoc network scales well with its number of nodes .",
    "percolation models have been extensively studied both in mathematical and communication literature . the model proposed in  @xcite , called now the _ gilbert s model _  , is now considered as the classical continuum model in percolation theory .",
    "it assumes that each node has a given fixed range of communication @xmath3 and direct connection between any two nodes is feasible if they are within the distance @xmath3 from each other , regardless of the positions of other nodes in the network .",
    "the known answer to the percolation problem in this model is given under the assumption that the nodes are distributed according to a homogeneous poisson pp having a _ density _ of @xmath4 nodes on average per unit of volume ( or surface ) .",
    "the result says that there exists a _",
    "non - degenerate critical communication range _ @xmath5 , such that for @xmath6 there is no giant connected component of the network ( the model does not percolate ) , while for @xmath7 there is exactly one such component ( the model percolates ) , both statements holding true almost surely ; i.e. , for almost all poisson realizations of the network . an equivalent statement of the above result says that for a given communication range @xmath3 there exists a non - degenerate critical density of nodes @xmath8 , below which the model does not percolate and above which it does so almost surely .    as one of the main results of this paper we will prove an extension of the above result , which says that the _ critical communication range of any homogeneous sub - poisson gilbert s network model is not degenerate_. moreover",
    ", this critical communication range is bounded away from zero and infinity by the constants which depend only on the mean density of nodes and not on the finer structure of the sub - poisson pp of network nodes .",
    "partial results , regarding only non - degeneracy at zero or at infinity can be proved for @xmath9 and @xmath2-sub poisson networks respectively .      a more adequate percolation model of a wireless communication network , called the _ sinr _",
    "graph , was studied more recently in  @xcite .",
    "it allows one to take into account the interference intrinsically related to wireless communications .",
    "the interference power is modeled by the _ shot - noise _ field generated by the pp of transmitting nodes .",
    "each pair of nodes in the new model is joined by an edge when the signal power to this shot - noise plus some other ( external ) noise power ratio is large enough .",
    "the resulting random graph does not have the independence structure of the gilbert s model and increasing the communication range ( equivalent in this model to increasing the signal power and hence the value of the shot - noise ) is not necessarily beneficial for connectivity .",
    "similar observation holds as regards the increase in the node density .",
    "in fact , the above sinr network model has two essential parameters : the density @xmath4 of poisson pp of nodes and the shot - noise reduction factor @xmath10 .",
    "the percolation domain is characterized in the cartesian product of these two parameters .",
    "the key result of @xcite says that whenever @xmath4 is larger than the critical value corresponding to the percolation of the model with interference perfectly canceled out ( for @xmath11 , which simplifies the model to the gilbert s one ) then there exists a critical value @xmath12 such that the model percolates for @xmath13 and does not percolate for @xmath14 .",
    "as the second main result of this paper , we extend the above result , also to sub - poisson sinr networks .",
    "our proofs rely on the comparison of extremal and additive shot - noise fields generated by @xmath0-ordered pp s studied in  @xcite .",
    "while the connection to the sinr model is evident ( additive shot - noise is an element of this model ) the connection to the gilbert s model is perhaps less evident and relies on the fact that this latter model can be represented as a upper level - set of some extremal shot - noise field",

    "* propsition  4.1 ) one can conclude that the probability of @xmath15 given locations in the space _ not _ being within the communication range of any of the nodes in the gilbert s model is higher for the network whose nodes are modeled by a pp larger in @xmath0 order . using this property , suitable discretization of the model and the peierls argument ( cf .",
    "@xcite or  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 14.1.4 ) ) one can prove finiteness of the critical transmission range in the sub - poisson gilbert s network .",
    "the strict positivity of this range can be proved by comparing the expected number of paths from the origin to the boundary of an increasing box , again in some suitable discretization of the model .",
    "this latter comparison can be done relying only on weak sub - poisson assumption .    _ the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows _ :",

    "let us take one step further and consider the interference created by the original pattern of network points ( the back - bone process @xmath83 ) rather than an external ( independent ) interference field .",
    "in this case the interference @xmath172 at receiver @xmath98 usually has to be considered under the so - called palm distribution of @xmath83 _ given _ the location of the emitter ( in @xmath83 ) of this receiver @xmath98 ( again see e.g. the bipolar model of spatial aloha in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  16 ) for a detailed example ) .",
    "the problem is that @xmath0 ordering of @xmath83 implies only @xmath1 ordering of the respective palm versions of @xmath83 ; cf .  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental reason for the required `` extra '' _ increasing _ property of the comparable functions is that a smaller in @xmath0 pp @xmath83 ( having less clustering or even some point `` repulsion '' ) will have under palm probability potentially _ fewer points in vicinity of the conditioned point_. this potentially decreases interference created locally near this point , thus potentially increases our capacity characteristic . more formally : having @xmath1 ordered of @xmath83 under palm probability @xmath173 and the capacity expressed as a @xmath2 function of @xmath174 we can not conclude any inequality for @xmath175 $ ] .    the situation is naturally inverted when we are dealing with pp which are @xmath0 larger than poisson pp .",
    "a detailed analysis in  @xcite of the outage capacity in the bipolar model generated by some poisson - poisson cluster pp known as neyman - scott pp ( which is @xmath0 larger than poisson pp ) confirms the above observations .",
    "namely , for smaller transmission distance the negative impact of clustering ( locally more interferers ) decreases the outage capacity , while for larger transmission distance the positive impact of interferers being more clustered increases this capacity .",
    "percolation models have been also shown useful to study the transport ( multi - hop ) capacity of ad - hoc networks .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , by using a specific multi - hop transmission strategy that involves percolation theory models , it was shown that a poisson sinr network can achieve capacity rate of the order of @xmath176 bits per unit of time and per node , thus closing the gap with respect to the rate @xmath177 shown achievable in poisson networks in  @xcite . an interesting and open question ( particularly in view of what was shown above )",
    "is whether these capacity results can be extended to sub - poisson networks .",
    "from  ( * ? ? ? * section  5.2 , 5.3 ) , we have a rich source of examples of cox ( doubly stochastic poisson ) pp s comparable in @xmath0 and @xmath2 order .",
    "in particular , we know that the so called lvy - based cox pp ( with poisson - poisson cluster pp as a special case ) is @xmath0 larger than the poisson pp of the same mean intensity . thus , they can be called as _ @xmath0-super - poisson_. however , note that any cox pp , whose ( random ) realizations of the intensity are almost surely bounded by some constant , can by coupled with ( constructed as a subset of ) a poisson pp with intensity equal to this constant .",
    "consequently such cox processes are trivially @xmath1-sub - poisson .      in the remaining part of this section we concentrate on the construction of examples of @xmath0-sub - poisson pp s .",
    "consider some lattice ( e.g. the planar hexagonal one , i.e. , the usual `` honeycomb '' model often considered in cellular network context ) .",

    "perturbations , it can be shown that these pp s are @xmath0 ordered if their respective @xmath179 s are convexly ordered .",
    "this follows from proving that the following function @xmath185 is convex in its argument @xmath15 : @xmath186 for any @xmath0 function @xmath27 , disjoint bounded borel subsets @xmath187 and any fixed @xmath178 of the original lattice . *",
