    "hickson compact groups ( hickson 1982 , referred hereafter as hcgs ) are collections of three to seven galaxies inside a three - magnitude interval , where the members have a projected separation of the order of the galaxy diameter .",
    "the original photometric selection criteria found spectroscopic confirmation for 92% of the group candidates @xcite . with a low velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) and a high galaxy density ,",
    "hickson compact groups are privileged laboratories to study different stages of interactions , from violent interacting systems to systems with no apparent signs of interaction .",
    "we began in 1995 an observing program using a fabry - perot instrument to obtain 2d - velocity maps of hickson compact group galaxies with the aim of investigating the influence of the dense environment on the kinematics and dynamics of their galaxy members .",
    "such a study is the extension of a previous effort in the same lines , in order to determine the influence of the dense environment of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "we first looked at a few particularly interesting groups in detail , in order to understand the evolution of galaxies in such dense environment .",

    "these studies revealed that there are large differences in the kinematic behavior of these systems , between galaxy to galaxy within a group and between one group to the other . combining the kinematics of the galaxies with other data from the literature we were able to classify the groups in different evolutionary stages , from evolved groups , strongly interacting , to unevolved systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present fabry - perot data for a set of three hickson compact groups , hcg 88 , hcg 89 and hcg 100 .",
    "we were able to derive kinematic information for 15 galaxies in these groups .    when available , we also present rotation curves ( rcs ) from previous studies using long - slit spectroscopy ( rubin et al .",

    "the continuum level was taken to be the mean of the three faintest channels , to avoid channel noise effects .",

    "the rc derived in this study is symmetric , i.e. both sides of the curve match , which is not observed in the rc derived by rhf1991 .",
    "indeed , the latter displays a flat approaching side and a rising receding side , while in the present paper we find that both sides are rising .",
    "the disagreement between both sides of rhf1991 s rc is probably due to a bad choice of the kinematic center of rotation , as it can be suspected from the strong disagreement between both sides of their rc around the center , within 5 arcsec .",
    "the rc derived by nsomt2000 does not agree with those derived by us and by rhf1991 .",
    "moreover , they derive an rc out to 16 arcsec only , while rhf1991 and this paper present rcs which extend out to 32 arcsec ( 12.5 kpc ) .    the sbb galaxy hcg 88b presents a very clumpy monochromatic map , with a strong asymmetric emission in an arm - like feature in the northeastern side and a less strong emission region in the southern region . in contrast , on the northwestern side of the galaxy , almost no emission can be seen .",
    "due to the presence of a bar in this galaxy ( sbb ) , the continuum image shows an asymmetric and irregular shape , rotating from 34@xmath22 within 10 arcsec to 160@xmath22 at a radius of 30 arcsec . at large radius ( 50 arsec )",

    "3b shows our data together with that from nsomt2000 .",
    "the rc obtained by nsomt2000 is plotted with a pa = @xmath24 , which is orthogonal with respect to the pa = @xmath25 we derived for the major axis of this galaxy .",
    "this obviously leads to very different results , which can not be directly compared .",

    "this was noted by rhf1991 , who suspected that this knot was a tidal dwarf candidate .",
    "the brightest part of the h@xmath6 knot is very round and a velocity gradient of @xmath35 can be measured from one side to the other .",
    "this very bright giant hii region will perhaps become a tidal dwarf galaxy .",

    "a bright emission region is visible in the h@xmath6 monochromatic map , we called hcg 89x on fig . 7a . at very low intensity level ( not shown here ) , our continuum image shows that this isolated region is in fact weakly linked ( by a stellar bridge ) to the main body of hcg 89a .",
    "we do not know the absolute velocity of this object since we have no absolute measurement of it , but only relative velocities subject to a shift of the free spectral range of the interferometer ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "the kinematic and stellar major - axis position angles of hcg 89a differ by 10@xmath22 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the velocity field of hcg 89a shows no major twisted isovelocities at large radii , which is confirmed by the symmetric rc for radii larger than 8 arcsec ( 4.6 kpc ) .",

    ", a very steep velocity gradient is observed to the northeast ( receding side ) , up to 4 arcsec ( 2.3 kpc , @xmath9 ) , followed by a decrease of @xmath44 to 8 arcsec ( 4.6 kpc , @xmath45 ) .",
    "farther out , the two sides of the galaxy match . note that this high - velocity spot does not present any morphological counter part neither in the h@xmath6 map nor in the continuum image .",
    "in the northwestern side of the galaxy , the velocities rise regularly .",
    "this non - bulgy galaxy is not classified as a barred galaxy .",
    "in fact , the asymmetric signature of the velocity field could not be due to a bar perturbation since that would give rise to a symmetric feature .",
    "the rc of hcg 89a extends up to 30 arcsec ( 17.3 kpc ) for a velocity of @xmath46 .",
    "rhf1991 and nsomt2000 published rcs for this galaxy , which can be compared to that derived here .",
    "the rc derived by rhf1991 is symmetric and reaches 25 arcsec ( 14.4 kpc ) , where the receding and approaching sides match well except for the high velocity spot and the depression discussed before .",
    "the shape of both rcs is quite similar ( we also can notice the presence of the high velocity region at -5 `` ) except for the approaching part when , our rc decreases and their has a flat shape .",
    "the main difference between our data and their ( fig .",
    "9a ) , comes from the velocity amplitude ( @xmath47 and @xmath45 respectively ) .",
    "this difference is due to the kinematic inclination we deduced from the velocity field ( 45@xmath48 ) and the inclination deduced from the photometry by rhf1991 ( 60@xmath48 ) .",
    "indeed , the velocity dispersion observed at each radius for different azimuthal angles reaches a minimum for an inclination of 45@xmath49 , ( see @xcite for more details on the method we used to determine the inclination ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the morphological inclination is indeed the value used by rhf1991 ( 60@xmath48 ) , if one excludes the southeastern knot discussed above .",
    "as this knot is visible in the continuum image and as we argued that this knot belongs to the main body of the galaxy , there is no reason to exclude it to determine the inclination of the galaxy . including this knot , the morphological inclination becomes compatible with the kinematic one ( 45@xmath49 ) .",
    "the rc determined by nsomt2000 is more irregular than that of rhf1991 and ours , emphasizing the high velocity region .",
    "in addition , it does not reach as far out as the other rc s do ( only out to 20 '' ) .",
    "the velocity amplitudes derived by nsomt2000 agree better with ours because the inclination adopted ( 51@xmath48 ) is more similar to the inclination derived by us .",
    "the monochromatic and continuum images of hcg 89b show well a spiral structure .",

    "even if we use our continuum map to derive a photometric inclination ( which is presumably what they used ) , the value we find is 56@xmath48 ( see table 4 ) , still lower than the value of inclination used by rhf1991 to derive the rc of hcg 89b . simulating a long slit on our vf and using rhf1991 s parameters",

    "the rotation of this object is not consistent with a disk - like rotator .",
    "hcg 100c is a late - type barred spiral galaxy .",
    "the monochromatic map shows strong central emission with an extension out to a radius of 35 \" .",
    "@xcite show an h@xmath6 image of the central part of the galaxy only .",
    "the pa of the major axis obtained in the continuum map is slightly different from the monochromatic map ( stellar and kinematic axes differ by 20@xmath48 ) .",
    "the velocity map clearly shows the presence of the bar , with the central @xmath60 isovelocity .",
    "the velocity field also shows the strong variation of the major axis along the radius and presents inconsistent isovelocities to the northeast .",
    "the rc of hcg 100c shows pretty good agreement between both sides out to a radius of 13 arcsec ( 4.5 kpc ) .",
    "further out , the receding side continues to rise out to 14 arcsec ( 4.9 kpc ) and then reach a plateau .",
    "the approaching side has dropping velocities for radii between 13 arcsec to 20 arcsec ( 7 kpc ) .",
    "this drop corresponds to the inconsistent isovelocities to the northeast of the velocity field .",
    "we compare the rc derived in this study with that derived by rfh1991 ( fig .",
    "there is good agreement only in the center .",
    "hcg 100d is a late - type edge - on spiral galaxy .",
    "no redshift information is available for this object but , due to the narrow fhwm of our interference filter ( 17    = @xmath61 ) , the probability for this object to be part of the group is high .",
    "the monochromatic image of the galaxy shows a clumpy structure , consistent with the image produced by @xcite .",
    "the continuum map is regular , but with a knot to the northeast .",
    "the knot corresponds to an excess emission on the monochromatic map .",
    "the velocity field if fairly regular but also shows a variation of the isovelocities along the radius .",
    "the rc of hcg 100d is continuously rising , both sides agree well within 8 arcsec ( 2.8 kpc ) and further out the discrepancy between both sides increases with radius .",
    "the velocity amplitudes reach @xmath62 and @xmath9 for the approaching and receding sides respectively at a radius of 30 arcsec ( 10.4 kpc ) .",
    "hcg 100x is an extragalactic emission object located 30 `` east of hcg 100b .",
    "we did not find any mention of this object in the literature .",
    "this object has an h@xmath6 extension of 20 '' and a very compact and intense nucleus of 5 \" radius .",
    "line emission and continuum emission are concentrated in the nucleus but we observed a shift of 2 arcsec between both maxima .",
    "the velocity map is not axisymmetric , as can be seen also in the rc .",
    "the approaching and receding sides of the rc disagree completely .",
    "one of the main reasons why it is important to have the full kinematic information for each compact - group member is to have some insight about the possible interaction history of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite described several interaction indicators and listed those present in the galaxies studied by them .",
    "similarly , in table 5 , we list different indicators for all the galaxies studied here . different interaction scenarios , depending on the strength of the encounter and the morphological types of the interacting systems , will leave different signatures on the velocity fields of the galaxies . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "indicators like _ highly disturbed velocity field , double nuclei and double kinematic gas component _ are used to show strong evidences for merger .",
    "other indicators such as _ warping , stellar and gas major axis misalignment , tidal tail , high ir luminosity and central activity _ are used to show indications of collisions which do not lead to merging .",
    "the data presented in this paper support the existence of regular gaseous rotating disks in the centers of all studied galaxies , except for hcg 100b . based on the interaction indicators for each galaxy listed in table 5 and in the context of the various models of galaxy interactions ( @xcite , @xcite ) we suggest the following histories for the 12 giant galaxies studied here .    galaxies hcg 88c , hcg 88d and hcg 100d seem to be undisturbed galaxies , with no signs of interaction . however , hcg 88d and hcg 100d may be in unfavorable inclinations to see any signs of interaction in their velocity fields .",
    "although we have small number statistics , this small sample of undisturbed galaxies is composed of the faintest members of their respective groups .",
    "galaxies hcg 88a , hcg 88b , hcg 89a , hcg 89b , hcg 89c and hcg 89d seem to have suffered mild interaction .",
    "hcg 89a has a strong kinematic peculiarity only in its center .",
    "hcg 89c has a peculiar velocity field but no other sign of strong interaction .",
    "the remaining galaxies show evidence for mild interaction histories .",
    "galaxies hcg 100a , hcg 100b and hcg 100c are galaxies which show strong interaction .",
    "these are all in one single group , suggesting that in this group strong encounters have happened in the past .",
    "this group must be , therefore , in an advanced stage of evolution .",
    "hcg 100a may have also suffered a major accretion event , given its very peculiar velocity field .",
    "hcg 88 does not display many indicators of having suffered interaction and it displays no indicators of merging .",
    "hcg 88c and hcg 88d do not show any interaction signature at all .",
    "we should note , however , that the rc for hcg 88d is difficult to obtain because of the high inclination of the disk .",
    "hcg 88b has the most disturbed velocity field for this group and it has the least regular rc of the four galaxies of the group .",
    "however , it can not be classified as `` highly disturbed '' , as other galaxies in group hcg 100 are .",
    "hcg 88a is an active galaxy but there is no evidence in its velocity field , that this galaxy has suffered interactions in the recent past .",
    "this is not an unexpected result , since it is well known that although active galaxies often appear to be in interaction , it is not always the case . in conclusion ,",
    "hcg 88 may be an unevolved group , which has recently formed , with low level of interaction .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusion from the hi kinematic study of this group @xcite .",
    "the list of table 5 shows that the galaxies in hcg 89 have more positive indicators than those in hcg 88 .",
    "hcg 89c seems to have the most disturbed velocity field .",
    "hcg 89b , hcg 89c and hcg 89d show mildly disturbed rotation curves .",
    "hcg 89a has a large disturbance in its center , perhaps because of the canibalism of a small galaxy , or perhaps due to an interaction with the bright emission blob present in the eastern part of the galaxy .",
    "the difference of systemic velocities between hcg 89c and hcg 89d is only @xmath44 and the projected distance is 30 arcsec .",
    "it is tempting to say that these two objects may be in interaction .",
    "the velocity field of hcg 89d shows an extension to the south , towards hcg 89c , but the velocity difference between the two galaxies is @xmath63 , which is too large for a scenario of gas exchange between the two objects .",
    "this distant group does not have a lot of ism material but hcg 89d clearly shows an excess of warm gas in comparison with hcg 89c .",
    "we conclude that this group is in an intermediate evolutionary phase , not as unevolved as hcg 88 but also not as evolved as hcg 100 .",
    "hcg 100 shows many signs of interactions .",
    "three of the four giant galaxies of the group have a highly disturbed velocity field and no member has a rc which is completely regular and axisymetric ( however we should note that the peculiarity for hcg 100d is small but difficult to detect due to its high inclination ) .",
    "change of pa of the major axis along the radius is also present for three galaxies in this group .",
    "however , no central activity has been found for any group member .",
    "the most disturbed group member is hcg 100b .",
    "this object may be the product of a merger . in conclusion ,",
    "hcg 100 is the most evolved group of the three studied here .",
