    "in the rocket flight which discovered x - ray stars ( giacconi et al 1962 ) , the presence of a diffused x - ray background ( xrb ) was also observed .",
    "reviews of the findings up to the middle 70 s are given in gursky and schwartz ( 1977 ) , fabian and barcons ( 1992 ) and references therein .",
    "the measurement by uhuru of the high degree of isotropy led to the conclusion that the xrb had to be extragalactic .",
    "the logn  logs relation for sources at high galactic latitude ( @xmath26 ) showed a slope of 1.5 which would account for the entire xrb already at fluxes larger than 10@xmath27 erg @xmath4 s@xmath3 ( matilsky et al 1973 ) .",
    "the required number of discrete sources had to be large ( @xmath28 sr@xmath3 ) to be consistent with the value of the fluctuations of @xmath29% over 2 degrees ( schwartz et al 1976 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the xrb had been measured over the range 3 to 100 kev and could be fitted with two power laws of index @xmath30 = 1.4 for @xmath31 kev and @xmath32 for @xmath33 kev ( gursky and schwartz 1977 ) .",
    "however , the results of heao1 gave an excellent fit over the @xmath34 kev range of the xrb spectrum to a thermal bremstrahlung from a hot plasma at 40 kev , leading the authors ( marshall et al 1980 ) to suggest that the flux could be due to a hot intergalactic medium as had been considered by field and perrenod ( 1977 ) .",
    "the finding that the spectrum of agns had been measured to be steeper than that of the xrb ( mushotzky 1984 ) further strengthened the view that the xrb could not be due to the sum of known sources .    on the other hand , the einstein survey showed that about 25% of the soft xrb ( 13 kev ) was resolved into discrete sources at a flux of order @xmath35 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 ( giacconi 1980 , griffiths et al .",
    "a large fraction of these sources were agns .",
    "a reasonable extrapolation of the x - ray properties and optical counts of extragalactic sources led to the conclusion that it was unlikely that discrete sources contributed less than 50% of the xrb ( e.g. , schmidt & green 1986 ; setti 1985 ) .",
    "if so , and their spectrum continued to be steep ( energy index @xmath36 ) , then one could show that a diffuse bremsstrahlung hypothesis for the residual was untenable ( giacconi & zamorani 1987 ) . the cobe result entirely ruled out the possibility that the xrb could be due to thermal bremsstrahlung from a hot plasma ( mather et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the rosat survey established that 7080% of the xrb is resolved into discrete sources in the 1 - 2 kev range at a flux level of @xmath37 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) . at higher energies",
    "( 210 kev ) the asca and bepposax satellites have achieved detection limits of @xmath38 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 and have resolved @xmath39 of the 2 - 10 kev xrb into discrete sources ( ogasaka 1998 ; cagnoni et al . 1998 ; della ceca et al .",
    "1999a ; giommi , fiore & perri 1998 ) .",
    "the population of sources appears to be composed of obscured and unobscured agns .",
    "the majority of hard sources appear to have counterparts in the soft x ",
    "ray band and are believed to be obscured agns . in this case , the soft emission may be due to electron scattered radiation . in addition to the scattered radiation , there are in principle several possibilities why obscured agn could show up in the soft band : a very high redshift , so that the absorption cutoff is shifted to the soft energy band ; a starburst component ; photoionized gas emission ( as observed by xmm in ngc 1068 , paerels 2000 ) .    the very high sensitivity , broad energy range and high angular resolution of the chandra observatory ( weisskopf , odell & van speybroeck 1996 ) will permit the final resolution of the origin of the xrb at least in the 0.5 to 10 kev range",
    ". however , the most important aspect of the deep surveys ( exposure time @xmath40 msec ) to be conducted with chandra will be the study of the individual classes of objects rather than their integrated properties . based on the limiting sensitivity , exposure map and source surface density found in the first chandra data , we expect a limiting flux of @xmath41 } = 2\\times 10^{-17}$]erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 in the center of the field for 1.5 msec of exposure .",
    "such a depth will permit the study of : ( 1 ) the formation and evolution of agns at large redshifts ( @xmath42 ) ; ( 2 ) clusters of galaxies at redshifts greater than @xmath43 and ( 3 ) study of star  forming regions in galaxies at moderate redshifts ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we selected a field for our observations which has the following properties : ( 1 ) very low galactic neutral hydrogen column ( @xmath45 )  a southern sky equivalent to the lockman hole ; ( 2 ) no stars brighter than @xmath46 and ( 3 ) well suited to observations with 8 meter class telescopes such as the vlt and gemini .",
    "our observations are centered at ra = 3:32:28.0 dec = -27:48:30 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the results in this paper pertain to the initial 130 ksec of observations out of the currently planned 500 ksec ( another exposure of 500 ksec has been approved , for a total of 1 msec , for the end of the year 2000 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 we describe the data reduction . in  3 we will present the results on the x  ray data including spectral properties of the sources , number counts and correlation function . in ",
    "4 we will describe the optical data . in  5",
    "we will discuss our results .",
    "finally , we will summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) data are obtained from the combination of two exposures taken when the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer  imaging ( acis - i ) detector was at a temperature of -110 k. the first observation ( obs i d 1431_0 ) was taken on 1999 - 10 - 15/16 , in the very faint mode , for a total 34 ks exposure . the second observation ( obs i d 1431_1 ) was taken on 1999 - 11 - 23/24 , in the faint mode , for a total 100 ks exposure .",
    "the data were reduced and analyzed using the ciao software ( release v1.3 , see http://asc.harvard.edu/cda ) . the level",
    "1 data were processed using the latest calibration files and the latest aspect solution .",
    "we included the new quantum efficiency uniformity files , that correct the effective area for loss due to charge transfer inefficiency at a temperature of -110 k. this correction compensates for the loss of events far from the readout , especially at high energies , and it is particularly relevant when fitting the total spectrum in the broadest energy range .",
    "the data were filtered to include only the standard event grades 0,2,3,4 and 6 .",
    "all hot pixels and columns were removed as were also the columns close to the border of each node , since the grade filtering is not efficient in these columns .",
    "we looked for flickering pixels , defined as pixels with more than 4 events contiguous in time .",
    "the removal of columns and pixels reduces slightly the effective area of the detector and this effect has been included when computing the total exposure maps .",
    "time intervals with background rates larger than @xmath47 sigma over the quiescent value ( @xmath48 counts s@xmath3 per chip in the 0.310 kev band ) were removed .",
    "this procedure gave 25 ksec of effective exposure out of the first observation , and 93 ksec out of the second , for a total of 118 ks .",
    "the two observations had different roll angles , so that the exposure in the combined image of the field ranges between 25 and 118 ksec over a total coverage of 0.096 deg@xmath49 .",
    "since the two observations have the same nominal aimpoint , the exposure time is 118 ksec over the majority of the field of view .",
    "the chip s2 was active during both observations .",
    "we did not include data from this chip in the following analysis , since the point spread function ( psf ) is very broadened ( @xmath50 arcsec ) and it adds a very small effective area especially at low fluxes .",
    "we selected a soft band from 0.52 kev and a hard band from 27 kev in which to detect sources .",
    "the hard band was cut at 7 kev since above this energy the effective area of chandra is decreasing , while the instrumental background is rising , giving a very inefficient detection of sky photons .",
    "a wavelet detection algorithm run on the 710 kev image , gives no sources over our detection threshold .",
    "note also that the counts expected on the acis - i detector in the 710 kev band for the hardest sources , are always no more than 3% of the total hard photons .",
    "thus , including the 710 kev band would always decrease the signal for the hard sources .",
    "however , we will always quote the fluxes in the canonical 210 kev band , as extrapolated from the flux measured from the 27 kev count rate , in order to have a direct comparison with the previous results .",
    "figure 1 shows a sky map of the field .",
    "we used a wavelet detection algorithm ( rosati et al .",
    "1995 ) to find x ",
    "ray sources . in order to match the psf variation as a function of the off - axis angle ,",
    "the wavelet analysis was carried out at five scales , @xmath51 pixels , for @xmath52 and pixel size 0.984 arcsec .",
    "simulations have shown that simple aperture photometry is very accurate across the acis ",
    "i detector and was therefore preferred to time  consuming wavelet photometry ( see rosati et al .",
    "the area of extraction of each source is defined as a circle of radius @xmath53 ( with a minimum of 5 pixels @xmath54 ) .",
    "the fwhm ( in arcsec ) is modeled as a function of the off - axis angle @xmath55 ( in arcmin ) as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 ( see the observatory guide , http://asc.harvard.edu/udocs/docs/docs.html ) .",
    "the background was calculated locally for each source in an annulus with outer radius of @xmath58 and inner radius of @xmath59 , after masking out other sources . with this choice ,",
    "the average number of counts in the background regions is @xmath60 1122 in the soft band and @xmath61 1734 in the hard band .",
    "thus the local estimate of the background has a poissonian fluctuation always less than 30% .",
    "we define the @xmath0 ratio as @xmath62 where s are the net counts in the extraction region of radius @xmath63 , and b are the background counts found in the annulus defined above and rescaled to the extraction region .",
    "since the lowest @xmath0 ratio of our final catalog is 2 across the field , the flux threshold across the field in the soft band , including the effect of vignetting and of the point spread function , is @xmath64 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 within the central 6 arcmin , and grows to @xmath65 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 at 10 arcmin off  axis . in the hard band ,",
    "the flux limit is @xmath66 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 within the central 6 arcmin , and @xmath67 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 10 arcmin off  axis . in the following",
    "we describe the analysis of point  like sources only , leaving the analysis of diffuse sources to a subsequent paper .",
    "we performed extensive simulations to determine the accuracy of our aperture photometry and our completeness limit .",
    "the aperure photometry with the aforementioned parameters is accurate within 3% . from the catalog of candidate sources selected by the wavelet detector",
    ", we remove all sources with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath68 , corresponding to 7 net counts in the center . with these criteria ,",
    "our detections have a less than 5% probability of including a fake source on the total acis - i field .",
    "this is a robust limit since the background is very low and we are always signal limited .",
    "more importantly , the simulations provide a test for the sky coverage model , which is defined as the area of the sky where a point  like source of a given flux can be detected by the wavelet algorithm and has a @xmath69 in the extraction region of radius @xmath70 .",
    "the effective solid angle of the chandra observations is equal to the geometrical solid angle ( 0.096 deg@xmath49 ) only at fluxes @xmath71 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 in the soft and hard bands respectively , whereas it drops at 50% of these values at fluxes @xmath72 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 . by comparing the input logn ",
    "logs with the output logn  logs in the simulations we verified that our model for the sky coverage is accurate within 5% .",
    "a further check comes from the preliminary analysis of a total exposure of 300 ksec of the cdfs .",
    "we found the presence of 5% of spurious sources , to be added to six sources associated with flickering pixels that were not removed from the exposure .",
    "we used two separate conversion factors to derive the energy flux from the observed count rate for the soft and hard bands .",
    "the conversion factors were @xmath73 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 per count s@xmath3 in the soft band , and @xmath74 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 per count @xmath75 in the hard band assuming an absorbing column of @xmath76 @xmath4 ( galactic value ) and a photon index , @xmath77 , consistent with the average spectrum of the bright sample .",
    "the uncertainties in the conversion factors reflect the range of possible values for the photon index , @xmath78 . as suggested by the spectral analysis of the stacked spectra , these values are representative of our sample ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the conversion factors were computed at the aimpoint ( which is the same for both exposures ) . before being applied to the net count rate of a given sources , the conversion factors are corrected for vignetting .",
    "the correction is given by the ratio of the value of the exposure map at the aimpoint to the value of the exposure map at the source position ( averaged over the extraction region ) .",
    "this is done separately for the soft and the hard band , using the exposure maps computed for energies of 1.5 kev ( soft ) and 4.5 kev ( hard ) .",
    "sources with more than 100 total counts in the two bands were analyzed also with xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) , fitting an absorbed power law to the data binned with a minimum of 20 photons per bin .",
    "the soft and hard fluxes of the fitted spectra are always within 10% of the values obtained using the conversion factors quoted above .",
    "the majority of the sources are faint .",
    "thus we measure the average stacked spectrum of both the faint sources and bright sources . to this purpose , we use only the longest exposure ( 93 ksec ) , in order to have a uniform exposure for the stacked spectra . from our sample of 159 sources ,",
    "5 were excluded because they were present only in the field of view of the first exposure .",
    "we divided the remaining sample into two groups of 29 and 125 with a dividing count rate of @xmath79 cts / sec in the total band 0.57 kev .",
    "the background spectrum was obtained using the event file of the total field of the same exposure , after the removal of the detected sources .",
    "the background is scaled by the ratio of the total exposure maps of the sources and of the background .",
    "such a procedure guarantees a correct background subtraction despite the non - uniformities of the instrumental background across acis - i .",
    "the ancillary response matrix for the effective area is obtained from the counts  weighted average of the matrices of the single sources .",
    "the response matrix is assumed to be the one computed in the aimpoint .",
    "we recall that we use the quantum efficiency uniformity file appropriate for a temperature of -110 k. this file corrects the quantum efficiency with respect to the pre ",
    "flight values ; especially , it takes into account the correction due to the charge transfer inefficiency .",
    "we used xspec to compute the slope of a power law spectrum with @xmath80 absorption at low energy , in the energy range 0.510 kev and in the 210 kev band only .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is fixed at the galactic value when the fit is done using the hard energy range , while , if the total energy range is used , @xmath80 is left free to vary .",
    "we exclude bins below @xmath81 kev because the calibration is still uncertain below this energy .    for the total sample , including all the 154 sources on the largest exposure",
    ", we performed a power - law fit over the energy range 0.510 kev , and obtained a photon index @xmath30 of @xmath82 and a column density @xmath83 @xmath4 .",
    "errors refer to the 90% confidence level .",
    "then we perform the fit using only the 210 kev energy range , with galactic @xmath84 @xmath4 .",
    "we obtained @xmath85 .",
    "the contribution of the total sample to the xrb is @xmath86 erg @xmath4 s@xmath3 deg@xmath15 in the soft band and @xmath87 erg @xmath4 s@xmath3 deg@xmath15 in the hard band .    for the bright sample we obtained a photon index @xmath30 of @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath4 from the fit in the 0.510 kev energy range .",
    "using the 210 kev energy range with galactic @xmath80 we obtained @xmath30 of @xmath90 .",
    "the contribution of the bright sample to the xrb is @xmath91 erg @xmath4 s@xmath3 deg@xmath15 in the hard band .",
    "we note that our bright sample shows a spectrum that is softer than that measured at about the same fluxes by asca in the energy range 210 kev ( della ceca et al .",
    "1999a find @xmath92 at @xmath93 cgs , ueda et al .",
    "1999 find @xmath94 ) .",
    "this may be due to cosmic variance , since we poorly sample the bright end of the number counts .    for the faint sample we obtained a photon index @xmath30 of @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath4 from the fit using the 0.510 kev energy range , and @xmath30 of @xmath10 with galactic @xmath80 using the 210 kev energy range .",
    "the contribution of the faint sample in the hard band is @xmath97 erg @xmath4 s@xmath3 deg@xmath15 . in this case",
    "the spectral shape of the faint sample is consistent with the average spectrum of the xrb , which is around 1.4 .",
    "we conclude that the average spectrum of the detected sources is approaching the average shape of the hard background ( see also mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the results of the spectral fits are shown in table 1 and 2 .",
    "the new quantum efficiency file provided with the cxc software was used which includes the effect of a reduced quantum efficiency at higher energies caused by the radiation damage .    to test the accuracy of our background subtraction",
    ", we perform the same spectral analysis in two ways .",
    "first , we build a synthetic spectrum using the software of m. markevitch ( see http://hea-www.harvard.edu/  maxim / axaf / acisbg/ ) and we extracted the background from the same regions used for the extraction of the source spectra . in this way",
    "we eliminate the uncertainties due to the use of different extraction regions for the sources and the background .",
    "the results are the same within a few percent .",
    "second , we build a background file summing all the background events found in the annuli around each source , and scaling the resulting file by the ratio of the total area af the extraction radius to the total area of the annuli . in this case too , the spectral fits change by a few percent .    a more detailed view of the spectral properties as a function of the fluxes comes from the hardness ratio @xmath98 where h and s are the net counts in the hard ( 27 kev ) and the soft band ( 0.52 kev ) , respectively .",
    "the distribution of the hardness ratios as a function of the count rate in the soft band is shown in figure 2 .",
    "there are 15 sources which are observed only in the hard band plotted at @xmath99 ( corresponding to 9% of the total combined sample ) and 68 which are observed only in the soft band , and are plotted at @xmath100 . when the hardness ratio of the stacked spectrum of the only hard and only soft sources are computed , we find respectively @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these hardness ratios are plotted as big asterisks .",
    "it is clear that faint sources are harder than bright ones , as already shown by the fits of the faint and bright stacked spectra .",
    "we note that the stacked spectrum of the 15 sources detected only in the hard band , is consistent with the typical hardness ratio of the sources detected in both bands at the count rate of @xmath103 cts / sec ( see asterisks in the upper left of figure 2 ) .",
    "in fact , we detected soft emission at 3 sigma levels in the stacked spectrum of these 15 sources .",
    "they have been missed in the soft band only because their emission were just below the detection threshold , while they would have been detected in a longer exposure . with this result , we have no evidence for sources in which the soft emission lower is lower than a 510 % of the energy emitted in the total ( 0.510 kev ) band .",
    "this is expected in synthesis models of the xrb , where a soft component is considered in obscured agns .",
    "we compute the number counts in the soft and hard bands .",
    "we show in figure 3 a comparison of the soft 0.52 kev band to the rosat results .",
    "we find the chandra results in excellent agreement with rosat in the region of overlap @xmath104 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the chandra data extend the results to @xmath105 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 . in figure 4",
    "we show the logn  logs distribution for sources in the hard band , extending to a flux limit of @xmath106 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , which represents a substantial improvement over previous missions .",
    "we performed a maximum likelihood fit with a power law in the range @xmath107 for the soft band and @xmath108 in the hard band .",
    "the resulting best fit to the soft logn ",
    "logs is : @xmath109 and to the hard logn  logs : @xmath110    the errors on the slope correspond to 2 sigma .",
    "the normalization of the soft counts is consistent within 1 sigma with the estimate of mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . on the other hand , we find that the previous chandra results for the hard counts reported by mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , shown as crosses , are higher by 40% ( see  5 ) . from the maximum likelihood analysis we find that the normalization of the hard counts is , in fact , more than three sigma lower than the value found by mushotzky et al .",
    "this is partially due to a different @xmath30 used in deriving the converson factors .",
    "if we use an average @xmath11 , which is appropriate for the faint end of the number counts , the discrepance in normalization between our hard counts and that of mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is reduced to 3 sigma .",
    "our hard counts are consistent with those derived from other deep acis - i pointings , namely the lynx field ( stern et al .",

    "the inclusion of the asca data at bright fluxes minimizes the effect of cosmic variance .",
    "we conclude that , given the uncertainty on the value of the total background , a fraction between @xmath117% and @xmath118% is still unresolved .    as for the total contribution to the soft x ",
    "ray background , we refer to the 12 kev band , following hasinger et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1998 ) and mushotzky et al .",

    "we have performed an analysis of the clustering of the x  ray sources in the cdfs using the sources which were identified in both the soft and hard bands . since the limited statistics of our sample is expected to provide a weak clustering signal , we consider the average value of the two - point angular correlation function , @xmath123 , defined as the excess of source pairs at separation @xmath124 with respect to a random distribution ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the random control sample was generated by distributing 50,000 points at random within an area of the sky with the same geometry as our field and a distribution modulated by the exposure map .",
    "statistical errors in our value of @xmath125 are estimated using the standard bootstrap resampling technique .",

    "our analysis shows a statistically significant correlation signal out to scales of about 100 arcsec , while the noise dominates at larger separations .",
    "there is a marginal indication for the brighter sources to be more clustered at smaller separations .",
    "if confirmed , this would indicate that close pairs tend to be formed preferentially by bright objects , as is apparent even by visual inspection of the cdfs .    vikhlinin & forman ( 1995 ) analysed the correlation function for the the angular distribution of sources identified within rosat pspc deep pointings .",
    "quite remarkably , and despite the different nature of the sample they used , their correlation function turns out to be consistent with our chandra data .",
    "although their much larger statistics and the wider pspc field  of  view allowed them to extend their analysis out to scales @xmath130 arcsec , the exquisite angular resolution achievable with chandra provides here a detection of a correlation signal down to scales @xmath131 arcsec , about four times smaller than those sampled by vikhlinin & forman ( 1995 ) .",
    "we defer to a forthcoming paper a detailed correlation analysis for the distribution of the chandra discrete sources and its implication for models aimed at explaining the nature of x  ray emission from agns .",
    "for identification of sources we have carried out an imaging survey in 3 bands , vri with the fors1 camera at the antu telescope ( ut1 of vlt ) ( programme i d 64.o0621 ) .",
    "we obtained exposures between 4000 to 7000 seconds in 4 adjacent fields of 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin@xmath49 covering a large fraction of the cdfs 16x16 arcmin@xmath49 field .",
    "some shallower r - band fields of about 1200 seconds each in were obtained with the fors imager in 4 additional positions in order to cover the entire area in the sky swept by different orientations of the chandra field of view .",
    "for a few objects we were able to obtain spectroscopic information using the fors1 multislit capabilities in march 2000 , just before the cdfsbecame inaccessible .    our identification process was complemented with data from the eso imaging survey ( rengelink et al .",
    "1998 ) in the j and k bands obtained with sofi at the ntt and in the uv bands obtained at the eso ntt + susi2 .",
    "we also used a @xmath132 arcmin image in b band obtained during the commissioning of the wfi camera at the eso / mpi 2.2 meter telescope .",
    "the near - ir imaging covers , at present , the central @xmath133 arcmin of the cdfs .    in the source identification process",
    ", we have found a positional offset of order of 0.3 arcsec and then found the correspondence of some of the brightest x  ray sources to likely candidates .",
    "we find an positional offset ( -0.2 , + 1.4 ) arcsec between the optical and x  ray data .",
    "using this correction we find x  ray / optical position deviations highly concentrated in a radius of rms 0.67 arcsec .",
    "a 2 arcesc correlation radius has been used for further analysis .",
    "spatial coincidence allows identification of a large fraction of the sources .",
    "approximately 10% of the x  ray sources with more than 10 detected counts have no immediately identifiable optical counterpart at @xmath134 .",
    "this could be due to a flux ratio @xmath23 larger than average but still close to the values observed for most of the sources ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "we find approximately @xmath135 of the sources are extended , which we associate with galaxies , and @xmath136 of the sources appear are point like . if we compare the diagram of x  ray flux vs r magnitude for rosat ( hasinger et al .",
    "1999 ) and the chandra deep field south , we find that a large part of the chandra sources appear to be consistent with an extension to fainter fluxes of the rosat sources , with an average @xmath137 .",
    "however a significant fraction of the sample ( @xmath138 ) appear to have a very low @xmath139 and is detected only in the soft band at fluxes @xmath140 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "most of these objects are identified as galaxies .",
    "another subsample of objects that have @xmath141 , appear below fluxes @xmath142 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 ( soft band ) .",
    "for these sources ( about 20 ) with no optical counterpart at @xmath143 , it could be that the corresponding objects are fainter , thereby increasing the @xmath23 to more than @xmath144 , or that they correspond to clusters .",
    "we also plot r - k vs r magnitudes for the chandra sources ( see figure 8) .",
    "the color magnitude plot of the sources in the chandra deep field south essentially overlaps the same plot with the rosat sources and extends to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the faintest chandra sources appear to have very red colors , r ",
    "k @xmath111 , with two of them at r ",
    "k @xmath145 , possibly indicating high redshift obscured agns .",
    "we have obtained spectroscopic data for a dozen optical counterparts of the x  ray sources using the multislit capability of fors1 .",
    "the results are reported in table 3 , where we give the redshift , the counts in the soft and hard bands , the hardness ratio , the 0.52 kev x  ray flux in erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , the 0.52 kev intrinsic luminosity in units of @xmath146 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , and the preliminary optical classification based on the width of the emission lines for seyferts and qsos .",
    "the objects described in table 3 are not meant to be a well defined sample .",
    "they are just a random sample of bright cdfs sources for which we obtained the first spectra .",
    "the optical follow up started october 26 2000 .",
    "at present we identify an elliptical galaxy where we observe an early type continuum with strong h and k absorption and weak , or no emission lines .",
    "in total we identified 4 qsos , 5 seyfert 2 galaxies , 1 elliptical galaxy and 2 galaxies in an interacting pair .",
    "while we make no claim for completeness , it is interesting to note that the type of objects we observe are not extremely different from those we have observed in the rosat surveys .",
    "this can also be shown by plotting the computed values of @xmath24 against z for the chandra identifications ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the many objects shown in the diagram are from previous surveys , as specified by different symbols .",
    "we note that the luminosity of the objects we have classified as qsos is of order @xmath147 erg s@xmath3 , while the luminosity of those we classify as seyfert 2 range between @xmath148 and @xmath149 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the elliptical galaxy has a luminosity of @xmath150 erg s@xmath3 and the nearby interacting pair galaxies have luminosities of 6 and @xmath151 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "none of these objects appear to exhibit unusual properties .",
    "from the sources detected in the chandra deep field south we resolve 6080% of the hard x  ray background .",
    "their x  ray and optical properties are consistent with agns being the dominant population .",
    "absorbed agns , which have hard x  ray spectra , are missed in shallow surveys because of absorption dimming .",
    "they should be detected efficiently at low fluxes .",
    "the average spectrum of sources detected in x  ray surveys is expected to become harder with decreasing flux .",
    "this trend , which has already been observed in surveys performed with other satellites , is shown in fig .",
    "although the average spectrum of the sources gets harder with decreasing flux , only a small fraction ( @xmath152 ) of the sources are detected in the hard band and not in the soft band .",
    "the hardness ratio of their stacked spectrum is consistent with the hardness ratios of the hard sources already detected both in the soft and hard bands , showing that they may lie just below the soft detection limit .",
    "this might imply that there is not a sizeable population of sources visible only in the hard band .",
    "indeed , even in highly obscured agns , soft x  ray emission could be produced by partial covering of the nuclear emission , scattered components , or circumnuclear starbursts associated with agn .",
    "evidence for soft components in obscured agns is commonly observed in good quality x  ray spectra ( e.g. turner et al . 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the x  ray color  color plot for recent asca and bepposax surveys ( della ceca et al",
    ". 1999b , fiore et al .",
    "2000 , giommi , perri & fiore , 2000 ) is consistent with this scenario , with the soft components being 110% of the nuclear emission .    for",
    "about 30% of the x  ray sources a host galaxy is resolved in the optical images .",
    "most of the objects clustered on the lower  left corner of the soft @xmath153 vs r diagram of figure 7 are associated with bright galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are overluminous in the r band with respect to the other x  ray detected sources .",
    "their x - ray emission generally comes from the center and is soft .",
    "many of them are undetected in the hard band .",
    "the upper limits of the hardness ratios indicate that for the four brightest galaxies the average slope is @xmath154 . for three of these galaxies",
    "we have measured redshifts of z = 0.075 , 0.075 and 0.215 with @xmath24 of @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath150 erg s@xmath3 respectively as given in table 3 .",
    "the remainder of the galaxies are optically fainter and presumably more distant with luminosity greater than @xmath148 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "all our soft galaxies fall below the detection threshold of the deepest rosat survey , @xmath13 erg @xmath4 s@xmath3 ( hasinger et al . 1998 ) , and thus chandra has opened up a new parameter space for the study of moderate redshift galaxies in the x  ray band .",
    "two sources have been detected in the k but not in the r band ( see figure 8) .",
    "they have r - k @xmath157 , and can be classified as extremely red objects ( eros , elston et al .",
    "very red colors would be produced both by a dust reddened starburst or by an old stellar population in high redshift galaxies ( @xmath158 , c.f .",
    "crawford et al . 2000 ) . in the first case the x",
    " ray emission could arise from a surrounding cluster .",
    "alternatively these objects could be high redshift obscured agns .",
    "the last hypothesis seems more likely for two objects with a similar color found by rosat in the lockman hole , based on their hard x - ray spectrum ( lehmann et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , the two eros in our field are detected only in the soft band , suggesting that the x  ray emission is likely due to a starburst component or to a cluster .",
    "another interesting possibility is that we are observing the soft scattered component in highly obscured compton - thick agns at high redshift .",
    "the cumulative number counts in the cdfs are fully consistent with those of mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in the soft band , while in the hard band we found a surface density lower by @xmath159% depending on the average spectral slope @xmath30 assumed for the x  ray source population . in the soft band",
    "the logn - logs is within the region allowed by rosat fluctuation analysis ( hasinger et al .",
    "1993 ) , while in the hard band the bepposax fluctuation analysis ( perri & giommi 2000 ) does not extend to sufficiently low fluxes to allow a full comparison .",
    "the source counts are in agreement within the errors with the predictions of agn synthesis models ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 , gilli et al .",
    "furthermore , the source density observed at low fluxes seems to favor models where the cosmological evolution of absorbed agns is faster than that of unabsorbed ones gilli , salvati & hasinger ( 2000 ) .",
    "in the chandra deep field south we have a similarly large survey area and limiting flux to the chandra deep field north carried out at penn state .",
    "our results are in general agreement with those quoted by this group who , in their two recent papers ( hornschemeier et al . 2000 , brandt et al . 2000 ) , concentrated on a limited number ( @xmath160 ) of sources where they had optical identifications .    the limiting flux of the mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) results is similar but the area surveyed is about one third of the two deep fields . while we agree on the soft counts , we have a @xmath161 40% lower normalization of the hard counts , which implies that an important fraction of the xrb , at least 20% , has yet to be resolved .",
    "our data confirm that the xrb is due to the summed contribution of individual sources . in the 0.52 kev band",
    "this result had been foreshadowed by the einstein measure of an individual source contribution of 25% ( giacconi 1980 ) and by the rosat determination of a 70% contribution ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) . at higher energies",
    "( 210 kev ) the contribution to the background from sources was of 25% ( cagnoni et al .",
    "1998 ; della ceca et al . 1999a",
    "; ueda et al . 1999 ; giommi , fiore & perri 1998 ) .",
    "our results bring the individual source contribution to the xrb in the 210 kev range to the level of 6080% . since there is still a non - negligible fraction of order 20 - 40% of the xrb to be resolved , it is important to push the detection limit at least down to @xmath162 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 in the hard band , or even at lower fluxes if the number counts flatten below @xmath13 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 .    with our increased number of sources we determined that the hardness ratio increases with fainter limiting flux and the spectrum of the fainter sources matches the background .",
    "much of this was expected from earlier work of setti and woltjer ( 1989 ) , schmidt and green ( 1986 ) , madau , ghisellini & fabian ( 1993 ) , comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and the asca results by della ceca et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "in addition , the angular correlation function of the x  ray sources in our field exhibits significant power on scales of order of the survey size . the slope and correlation length is consistent with that observed for galaxies .",
    "this indicates the presence of large ",
    "scale clustering at high redshift , whose spatial extent requires knowing the redshift distribution of the identified sources , by either spectroscopic or photometric methods .",
    "detailed analyses of the correlation function in chandra deep pointings will provide important complementary information on the nature of the discrete x - ray sources ( e.g. , haiman & hui 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "only 9% of the sources are detected in the hard band and not in the soft band .",
    "most of these sources show some flux in the soft band below our detection threshold .",
    "as discussed in  3.1 , the average hardness ratio of these faint sources is @xmath163 consistent with that found for the faint end of the sample .",
    "we conclude that we find no evidence for sources which are completely obscured in the x  ray soft band .    our colour - magnitude and flux ",
    "magnitude diagrams follow the trends well known from the rosat data .",
    "a small fraction of the x  ray sources ( @xmath164 ) with more than @xmath144 detected counts are not immediately identified at r @xmath165 26 .",
    "a substantial number of nearby galaxies appear in the chandra survey at very low @xmath166 and below the detection threshold of rosat .",
    "the x  ray emission from these galaxies is characterized by a soft spectrum and thus does not contribute significantly to the x  ray background at high energies . however , their study is of great intrinsic interest for the understanding of the properties and evolution of normal and starburst galaxies .",
    "chandra sensitivity is higher than or equal to that anticipated .",
    "longer exposures to the confusion limit will still be in a signal  limited regime . for a @xmath167 s exposure we should reach @xmath168 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 in the soft band , which would allow detection of @xmath169 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 at @xmath170 .",
    "this will enable a statistically significant study of normal and star  forming galaxies to significant look back times .",
    "studies of bright qsos can reach very large redshifts ( 510 ) and even observations of low surface brightness features ( e.g. , clusters ) can be extended to @xmath171 .",
    "a deep observation of 385 ksec in the same field is planned during the guaranteed time of one of us with xmm .",
    "the larger area of xmm will contribute significantly to the study of the spectra of point sources and the study of diffuse emission from galaxy clusters .",
