    "advances in the epitaxial growth technologies have lead to the fabrication of high - quality two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems that are almost defect - free and upon which electronic nanostructures can be built .",
    "the electron transport properties of these nanostructures have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "@xcite the most studied nanostructure is the quantum point contact ( qpc ) , due to its simple configuration , and due also to the significant quantization effects in such systems , as is shown in the conductance @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite        these qpc s , when created electrostatically by negatively biasing a split - gate located on top of a 2deg ,  @xcite can be pictured as a narrow constriction connecting adiabatically at each end to a 2deg ,  @xcite as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the energy levels in the narrow constriction are quantized into one - dimensional subbands which density of states ( dos ) is singular near a subband bottom .",
    "this singular dos was found , in the presence of an attractive scatterer , to give rise to dip structures in @xmath0 ,  @xcite which is associated with the formation of impurity - induced qbs s  @xcite formed just beneath a subband bottom .",
    "more recently , attentions have been shifted to qpc s acted upon by high frequency fields .",
    "these time - dependent fields include transversely ,   or longitudinally  @xcite polarized fields , or simply gate - induced time - modulated potentials .",
    "@xcite these studies focus on coherent inelastic scatterings by assuming the range of the time - modulated fields to be shorter than the incoherent mean free path . a number of interesting transport characteristics were explored . in the case of zero source - drain bias , it was demonstrated that electron pumping could occur when an asymmetric spit - gate is acted upon by a time - modulated field.@xcite in the case of a finite source - drain bias , and the qpc s have varying widths , the photon - assisted quantum transport characteristics have been studied .",
    "@xcite one might also be prompted by the impurity - induced qbs features ,  @xcite and ask whether the qbs s could find their way of manifestation in the time - dependent transport characteristics in qpc s . indeed , earlier studies have already found qbs features for cases when the qpc s have either a delta - profile oscillating barrier  @xcite or transverse field .",
    "@xcite in a recent study , we consider the more realistic case of a finite - range longitudinally polarized field , @xcite and we find qbs features that are associated with electrons making intrasubband and intersideband transitions to the vicinity of a subband bottom .",
    "since the transitions allowed depend on the polarization of the time - modulated field , we opt to investigate in this paper the qbs features for a finite - range transversely polarized field .    in theoretical studies of coherent quantum transport in mesoscopic nanostructures ,",
    "the transfer - matrix and the scattering - matrix method are powerful tools .",
    "both the methods enable us to numerically calculate current transmission probabilities for arbitrary shaped configurations .",
    "the conductance of the nanostructure can be obtained by landauer - bttiker formalism .",
    "@xcite however , since the transfer - matrix method fails in systems for which energy conservation is violated , it is unapt for a time - dependent external field acting upon the system .",
    "thus , one has to develop a generalized scattering - matrix method to calculate numerically the current transmission probability of a time - modulated mesoscopic nanostructure .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a generalized scattering method for a finite - range transversely polarized time - dependent electric field acting upon a narrow constriction , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "this method enables us to calculate not only the current transmission and reflection probabilities but also the contributions from each subband and sideband states yielded by the transversely polarized electric field .",
    "this transverse field @xmath1 has a finite longitudinal profile , namely that @xmath2 covers a length @xmath3 that excludes the reservoirs .",
    "the finiteness of the electric field in the @xmath4 direction breaks the longitudinal translational invariance , and hence allows electrons to make intersideband transitions not to conserve their longitudinal momenta .",
    "@xcite moreover , since the transverse electric field is not uniform in the @xmath5 direction , the transverse translational invariance is also violated .",
    "thus the electron - photon scattering processes can include intersubband transitions .",
    "this transmission mechanism is quite different with the scatterings that induced by a longitudinal field  @xcite or a time - modulated potential ,  @xcite where the electrons can only make intrasubband transitions ( the subband index remains unchanged ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the generalized scattering - matrix method is formulated that has incorporated a time - dependent mode - matching scheme to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation . the method described in sec",
    "ii is calculated numerically in sec .",
    "iii . from our numerical evidence",
    ", we predict that qbs features caused by the transversely polarized field can occur in narrow constrictions .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "in this section , the coherent inelastic scattering problem in the presence of a finite - range transverse electric field is formulated .",
    "the finite - range time - dependent electric field is divided by a series of segments , each of them is described by a @xmath6-profile field .",
    "@xcite the matching between these sliced regions has to be performed in the cascading of the scattering matrices , from which the transmission and reflection coefficients are obtained .",
    "the conductance @xmath0 is then expressed in terms of these coefficients .    previously , we have investigated transport properties of electrons in narrow constrictions acted upon by a longitudinally polarized time - dependent electric field .  @xcite the potential due to the longitudinal field that have a finite range in the @xmath4 direction , but remain uniform in the @xmath5 direction . this uniformity in the transverse direction",
    "allows us to propose a matching scheme that avoids slicing the region covered by the longitudinal time - dependent field .",
    "however , as long as the narrow constriction is acted upon by a transversely polarized time - dependent field , the translational invariance in the @xmath5 direction is breaked  both intersubband and intersideband transitions are involved .",
    "hence , we have to develop a generalized scattering method to formulate the quantum transport problem when a transverse external field acts upon the narrow constriction .",
    "since the electric field is assumed to be applied only on the narrow constriction region , we need only to formulate this scattering problem in the narrow constriction region . in the ballistic regime ,",
    "the length of the narrow constriction , @xmath7 , is smaller than the phase breaking length , @xmath8 , and hence the electron transport can be treated as a single particle problem .",
    "thus the electron transport can be formulated by a time - dependent schrdinger equation , given by @xmath9 with the hamiltonian of the form @xmath10 ^ 2 + v_c(y ) .",

    "recent experiments show that the transport characteristics are masked by the bolometric effect when the entire qpc , including the end - electrodes , is exposed to the incident electromagnetic field .",
    "@xcite second , the length @xmath3 of the time - dependent field has to be shorter than the wave length of the incident field .",
    "the purpose is to increase the coupling between the electrons and the photons by breaking the longitudinal translational invariance . that the coupling between the photon field and the conduction electrons can be much enhanced , when either the electrons are confined or the time - dependent field has a localized profile , has been pointed out recently by yakubo _",
    "_  @xcite thus the qpc needs to be in the near - field regime of the time - dependent field .    to avoid the bolometric effect , we suggest to apply ac field to the split gates of the qpc instead of shining an electromagnetic wave upon the qpc . the split gates are negatively biased with respect to a common ground , and made of superconducting materials with superconducting wires connecting to an ac - signal generator .",
    "this generator can be available using the impatt diode that has successfully been demonstrated to cover the complete millimeter range ( 30 - 300 ghz ) .",
    "@xcite this proposed experimental setup is expected to generate a transversely polarized electric field only in the narrow constriction region while keeping the two - end electrodes from the time - modulated field . in this work , though the time - dependent region covers only part of the narrow constriction , we believe these two situations will manifest similar features . given the availability of millimeter wave sources ,  @xcite the suggested experimental setup would be manageable by the present nanotechnology .",
    "the features reported in this work , however , are not limited to millimeter waves .",
    "a generalized scattering - matrix method has been developed for investigating coherent quantum transport in narrow constrictions with a transversely polarized time - dependent electric field .",
    "this method allows us to solve nonpertubatively the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the numerical sense .",
    "since the energy conservation law is violated in such a time - modulated system , a conventional transfer - matrix method technique is inapplicable . using the present numerical method ,",
    "not only the transmission and reflection probabilities of systems can be calculated , all the subband and sideband states can be obtained .",
    "the scattering processes due to the time - dependent external field are both inelastic and coherent .",
    "since this field is transversely polarized , electrons can make both intersubband and intersideband transitions .",
    "this increases the complexity in calculation , but has more interesting features .",
    "different dip structures associated with different intersubband and intersideband transitions to the vicinity of a subband bottom are found .",
    "these dip structures can be understood as the formation of a qbs at energy near a subband bottom due to its singular dos .",
    "@xcite moreover , due to the tunability of frequency and intensity of the field , this proposed configuration can be applied to be a high - frequency detector .",
    "we expect that these dip structures could also be found when the qpc has a varying width .",
    "we hope that the present method will be utilized to study new transport phenomena in mesoscopic nanostructures .",
    "the authors would like to thank the national science council of the republic of china for financially supporting this research under contract no .",
    "nsc88 - 2112-m-009 - 028 .",
    "computational facilities supported by the national center for high - performance computing are gratefully acknowledged ."
