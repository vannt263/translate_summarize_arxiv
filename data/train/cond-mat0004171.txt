    "one salient aspect of the high-@xmath5 materials is the vicinity of two , at first sight rather different , states of matter , superconductivity ( sc ) and antiferromagnetism ( af ) in their phase diagram .",
    "the transition between the undoped ( af ) system at half - filling and the sc phase is driven by doping with mobile holes . in most of the materials ,",
    "this transition is not direct , and a disordered `` spin - glass '' phase occurs in between .",
    "however , it has been argued that the `` clean '' material would display a direct transition from af to sc phases , and that the spin - glass phase occurs due to the high sensitivity to impurity disorder in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "a direct transition from an insulating into a sc phase in a quasi - two - dimensional system ( such as the high-@xmath5 materials ) is a very interesting , yet insufficiently understood issue .",
    "in fact , it is not clear whether this transition is second order down to zero temperature , and thus is related to a quantum critical point , or whether there is a finite - temperature classical bicritical point . in the framework of the projected so(5)-theory of high-@xmath5 superconductivity  @xcite",
    ", it has been suggested that the af and the sc phases may indeed coexist in some portion of the temperature versus doping phase diagram .",
    "another open question is the nature , i.  e.  the universality class of this transition .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that this transition may be controlled by an so(5)-symmetric fixed point  @xcite .",
    "so(5 ) symmetry is thus restored in the long - wavelength limit  @xcite , and af and sc can be described in terms of a unique superspin vector  @xcite in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "many efforts have been directed towards studying the af - sc transition in strongly correlated lattice models by numerical techniques such as quantum - monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations . as a relevant model , the hubbard model ,",
    "is widely accepted for the description of salient features of high-@xmath5 materials .",
    "unfortunately , it is quite difficult to study large enough hubbard - model systems by qmc , due to the occurrence of the minus - sign problem at finite doping .",
    "the numerical problem can , in principle , be cured , if one can drive the af - sc transition by means of a parameter , alternative to the doping , which conserves particle - hole symmetry and , therefore , avoids the tedious minus - sign problem .",
    "this idea was followed through by assaad , imada , and scalapino ( ais )  @xcite in terms of their so - called @xmath1 model .",
    "it rests on adding an interaction term @xmath4 , which depends on the square of the nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "this @xmath4 term can be obtained from a su - schrieffer - heeger type of electron - phonon interaction in the antiadiabatic limit @xcite . in qmc simulations @xcite this",
    "@xmath1 model exhibits a transition from an antiferromagnet to a d - wave superconductor at half - filling and at a critical value of the interaction @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the qmc data of ais supports the picture of a continuous quantum phase transition in the sense that the magnetization vanishes continuously at the critical point .",
    "the disadvantage of the @xmath1 model is that the bandwidth grows substantially with @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , one of us @xcite suggested to introduce a phase factor in the @xmath4-term which has a d - wave like symmetry .",
    "although this latter model solves the problem of the bandwidth , the existence of a phase transition to a d - wave superconductor remains open .",
    "while qmc calculations provide an essentially exact description of the properties of the model , semi - analytical , i.  e.  diagrammatic , calculations allow for a more direct understanding of the processes which are responsible for a given phenomenon .",
    "for this reason in this paper , we carry out a systematic diagrammatic study of the @xmath1 model .",
    "we first consider in sec .",
    "[ hartree ] the simple hartree - fock level , which , due to the complexity of the interaction terms , allows for different broken symmetry phases .",
    "however , a careful comparison of the energies of these phases shows that the antiferromagnetic phase is always the stablest one , even for very large values of @xmath4 .",
    "this holds for both versions of the @xmath1 model which are considered , i.  e.  with and without phase factors .",
    "moreover , the only allowed superconducting solution in the simple @xmath1 model has an @xmath9-wave symmetry , while @xmath10-wave symmetry is not allowed .",
    "these mean - field results are in strong contrast with the qmc calculations , which predict a transition to a @xmath10-wave sc state at some finite @xmath4  @xcite . on the other hand , in the af region our mean - field results are in very good accord with qmc , in particular concerning single - particle dispersions , as shown in sec .",
    "[ band ] .",
    "indeed the relevant transition to the d - wave sc state is dominantly driven by an effective attractive interaction mediated by spin fluctuation , as is the case for the hubbard model  @xcite . for this reason",
    ", one has to consider the effect of spin fluctuations beyond the hartree - fock level , in order to reach the sc state .",
    "this is done in sec .",
    "[ rpa ] , where we carry out a complete rpa summation of all particle - hole diagrams ( both bubbles and ladders ) , with hartree - fock green s functions , in order to obtain the frequency- and momentum - dependent spin and charge susceptibility .",
    "the solution of the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation is technically quite difficult to achieve and significantly more demanding than the standard case of the simple hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the finite extension of the interaction , as well as its dependence on all ( three ) momenta , and not on the momentum transfer only . by changing to a mixed real - space momentum - space representation ,",
    "we demonstrate that it can be reduced , for generic momenta , to the inversion of a @xmath11 matrix .",
    "next , in some analogy to the rpa - analysis of the @xmath12 hubbard model by schrieffer , wen , and zhang  @xcite , we derive the effective two - particle interaction vertex in the static limit , and solve the associated bcs equation . as for the simple hubbard model studied in ref .  , the @xmath10-wave solution turns out to be the only stable one , in accordance with qmc results . on the other hand , as expected ,",
    "the @xmath9-wave solution is unstable , due to the strong on - site hubbard repulsion @xmath2 . in the d - wave phase ,",
    "we obtain a decreasing superconducting gap as a function of @xmath4 , in spite of the fact that the attraction between the quasiparticles should be increased by @xmath4 .",
    "this is due , on the one hand , to the approximation of taking an energy cutoff for the effective interaction , which has been chosen to be of the order of the af gap , which , in turn , decreases with increasing @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the reduction of the density of states at the fermi level , which is related to the broadening of the bands produced by @xmath4 , contributes in reducing the superconducting gap .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] the @xmath1 model with and without phase factors is introduced , and briefly summarized in sec .",

    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath1 model is given by @xcite @xmath13 with the hopping kinetic energy @xmath14 and @xmath15 where in its original formulation @xmath16 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this model was introduced by assaad , imada , and scalapino  @xcite , in order to study the antiferromagnetic - superconducting transition at half - filling . as stressed by these authors",
    "@xcite , the particular choice of @xmath4 was mainly motivated formally as a means of introducing the desired quantum transition from the insulating ( af ) to the sc state .",
    "the choice of the interaction also guaranteed that no fermion - sign problem was encountered in the qmc simulations at half - filling . while there are various approximate ways to physically justify the form of the microscopic hamiltonian , it runs into problems when directly compared to the high-@xmath5 cuprates .",
    "one of the problems of this model is the presence of unphysically broad bands , which also cause problems in the numerical qmc evaluation .",
    "for this reason , one of us @xcite suggested to introduce in the @xmath17term of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) a d - wave like phase factor of the form @xmath18 the phase factor restores the correct width of the single  particle bands at half - filling .",
    "unfortunately , however no transition to a superconductor in qmc simulations @xcite has been observed so far .",
    "the @xmath4 term contains four different processes ( see e.g. ref .  ) , among them single  particle terms that renormalize the chemical potential and permit single ",
    "particle hopping between second and third nearest - neighbor sites as well as singlet and triplet scattering terms .",
    "these terms are not expected to be relevant for the low - energy physics @xcite . however , the most interesting term for the quantum phase transition is the fourth term which generates singlet pair - hopping and produces an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , i.  e. @xmath19 where @xmath20 . for @xmath21 the terms in @xmath22",

    "( [ 5a ] ) to ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 10a ] ) to ( [ 11 ] ) ( appendix [ a1 ] ) , we arrive at the following results :    figure [ fig1a ] displays the free energy of the different phases ( antiferromagnetic , superconducting and paramagnetic ) for the simple @xmath1 model ( top ) and the @xmath1 model with phase factors ( bottom ) as a function of @xmath4 for fixed @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    in the simple @xmath1 model ( fig .  [ fig1a ] , top )",
    "the antiferromagnetic solution ( af ) is always the most favorable .",
    "however , with increasing @xmath4 the energy of this solution approaches the paramagnetic solution ( pm ) .",
    "the superconducting solution ( sc ) has a much higher energy than the other solutions .",
    "the only possible superconducting solutions have @xmath24 ( see appendix [ a1 ] : no on - site pairing , due to @xmath2 ) and @xmath25 ( nearest - neighbor singlet pairing ) , while for @xmath26 there exists no superconducting solution .",
    "the superconducting order parameter @xmath27 corresponds to an s - wave like symmetry .    in the @xmath1 model with phase factors ( fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , bottom ) the mean - field ground state is also antiferromagnetic ( af ) . here ,",
    "however , in contrast to the simple @xmath1 model , the difference in energy with the paramagnetic ( pm ) solution is increasing with increasing @xmath4 . as discussed in appendix a , there also exist two different superconducting solutions , that lie energetically between the antiferromagnetic and the paramagnetic solution and evolve continuously from the paramagnetic solution at @xmath28 . in the first solution , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are nonvanishing , while @xmath31 ( s - wave ) .",
    "the order parameter has a s - wave symmetry with a superimposed weak modulation of the gap . in the second ,",
    "energetically more favorable , solution one has @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , yielding an order parameter with d - wave symmetry . notice that also in qmc simulations at half - filling , no transition to a superconductor was found in the @xmath1 model with phase factors , in agreement with our results .",
    "however , the mean - field result in fig .  [ fig1b ] is promising in direction of doping away from half - filling , where the af phase is suppressed .",

    "one can recognize easily that the bands are much wider than in the hubbard model but their shape is nearly unaltered .",
    "this means that if one would scale the bands by a factor @xmath33 , they would be almost identical .",
    "the effect of @xmath4 seems thus to be a mere `` dilatation '' of the bands .    in the @xmath1 model with phase factors",

    "the width of the bands is nearly the same as in the hubbard model , except for the lifting of the degeneracy along the boundaries of the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) . at @xmath35",
    "a kind of double - hump structure can be seen like it appears in @xmath3-@xmath36-@xmath37 models to describe high-@xmath5 superconductors @xcite .",
    "this can be explained as follows : the @xmath4 term contains also hopping processes to second and third nearest neighbor sites @xcite which , due to the phase factors , have the same sign as in the standard fit parameters @xmath38 which are often used to adjust the bands to the experimental data of bi@xmath39sr@xmath39cacu@xmath39o@xmath40 and yba@xmath39cu@xmath41o@xmath42 .    if one compares the antiferromagnetic bands to the qmc data @xcite of the @xmath1 model as in figs .  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , one gets a very good agreement .",
    "the width of the bands as well as the antiferromagnetic gap were reproduced excellently .",
    "in addition , the energy bands of the @xmath1 model with phase factors ( fig .  [ fig3b ] ) show the same double - hump structure at @xmath35 like it is seen in the qmc spectral weight @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "they also reproduce well the lift of the degeneracy along the boundaries of the mbz .",
    "finally , we want to look at two characteristic features of the antiferromagnetic solution : the sublattice magnetization @xmath44 and the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "the sublattice magnetization defined as @xmath45 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig6a ] ( top ) as a function of @xmath4 . as expected from the behavior of the free energy ( fig .",

    "this is also confirmed by qmc data @xcite , which show an amplification of the antiferromagnetic correlations with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "a similar picture occurs for the antiferromagnetic gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig6b ] , bottom ) . like the sublattice magnetization",
    ", the mott - hubbard gap is decreasing with increasing @xmath4 in the simple @xmath1 model , while it increases ( nearly linear ) with @xmath4 in the model with phase factors .    in summary ,",
    "the hartree - fock calculation gives the antiferromagnetic solution as ground state for any values of @xmath4 in both models .",
    "however , qualitatively there are remarkable differences between the two models with and without phase factors .",
    "a comparison of these results with the qmc data shows that the antiferromagnetic phase is described quite well by the mean - field approximation .    on the other hand ,",
    "the mean - field level is not able to reproduce the transition to a @xmath0-superconductor at @xmath46 observed in qmc simulations in the simple @xmath1 model .",
    "nevertheless , for large @xmath4 , for which the af gap becomes small , one would expect the antiferromagnetic solution to become instable with respect to fluctuations beyond the mean - field level .",
    "this is what we analyze in the next section .",
    "as demonstrated in the previous section , the hf mean - field approximation is not sufficient to describe the transition to a @xmath0-superconductor occurring in the simple @xmath1 model according to qmc simulations .",
    "for that reason , we carried out an improved calculation , including charge- and spin - density fluctuations .",
    "this has been done by means of a time - dependent hf or generalized random phase approximation ( rpa ) , in which we summed both `` bubble '' and `` ladder '' particle - hole diagrams .",
    "in contrast to the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) , the green s functions are not calculated selfconsistently , but taken over from the hartree - fock results , as it has been done in ref .  .",
    "the @xmath49 antiferromagnetic hartree - fock green s function can be written as ( see appendix [ a1 ] , eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) to ( [ 9 ] ) ) : @xmath50 with this green s function we can construct the hartree - fock two - particle propagator @xmath47 : @xmath51 where the set of @xmath52 stand for the indices of the @xmath49 matrix in eq .",

    "in contrast to the hubbard model , also the non - diagonal elements which couple the charge channel to the longitudinal spin channel have to be taken into account . for the following calculations it is also advantageous to transform from the representation @xmath58 to the representation @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 take the values @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    in this representation , e.  g. ,",

    "we obtain the bethe - salpeter equation in matrix form : @xmath76 this is now a simple matrix equation which can easily be inverted for the interacting two - particle propagator @xmath77 : @xmath78 in contrast to the hubbard model we have to deal with complex @xmath79 matrices for the transverse spin - channel and with complex @xmath11 matrices for the coupled charge-/ longitudinal spin - channel .",
    "the rpa susceptibilities can be constructed by taking the @xmath80-matrix element in real space , i.  e. : @xmath81 from this one obtains the retarded susceptibilities by the analytic continuation @xmath82 .",
    "starting from the idea that spin fluctuations are responsible for the pairing of the quasi - particles , it is reasonable to first concentrate on the dynamic spin susceptibilities for the antiferromagnetic nesting vector @xmath63 as a function of @xmath83 , as we expect the strongest response there . in fig .",
    "[ fig7a ] ( top ) , @xmath84 is plotted for the simple @xmath1 model with @xmath85 , while in fig .  [ fig7b ] ( middle ) @xmath84 is displayed for the model with phase factors and @xmath34 .",
    "both calculations can be compared with the result for the hubbard model , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig7c ] ( bottom ) .",
    "one can clearly see that the spectral weight is mainly concentrated at low frequencies and that it is abruptly decreasing at a frequency @xmath86 , which corresponds to the antiferromagnetic gap .",
    "this behavior is most evident in the simple @xmath1 model .",
    "moreover , one can recognize that the overall magnitude of the longitudinal spin susceptibility is biggest in the simple @xmath1 model and smallest in the @xmath1 model with phase factors .      in this section ,",
    "we calculate the effective 2-particle interaction mediated by the collective charge and spin fluctuations evaluated in the preceding section . here",
    ", we restrict to the model without phase factor , since this is the only one which , according to qmc calculations , displays @xmath10-wave superconductivity . as a first step , we evaluate the fluctuation vertex , from which we can determine the modifications of the bare 2-particle interaction given by the @xmath1 hamiltonian .",
    "the calculation of the fluctuation vertex is performed with the same techniques that were used to calculate the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "this gives the expression :    @xmath87    which is diagrammatically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "next , we have to change from the charge / spin channel representation back to the simple spin representation by inverting the transformation given by eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) : @xmath88 since we want to use the effective interaction in order to write an effective hamiltonian , only the static limit of the fluctuation vertex has to be considered .",
    "thus , simple diagrammatic rules @xcite yield for the correction to the bare interaction : @xmath89 the effective interaction can then be written as ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for diagrammatic representation ) @xmath90 with the bare 2-particle interaction @xmath91 and @xmath92 given by eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "since one has to consider the pairing of the hartree - fock quasiparticles , the effective interaction has to be transformed into the @xmath93-base , which produces additional coherence factors @xcite .    for physical reasons , only the pairing of particles with opposite spin ( singlet - pairing ) was considered . in order to take into account the effect of the dynamics on top of our static approximation",
    ", we follow ref .  , and introduce a cutoff frequency @xmath94 , analogous to the debye frequency @xmath95 in the standard bcs theory .",
    "this ensures that only particles within an interval of width @xmath96 above and below the fermi energy @xmath97 are paired .",
    "the motivation for this cutoff frequency @xmath94 becomes clear if one looks at the spin susceptibilities of the simple @xmath1 model in fig .",
    "[ fig7a ] .",
    "we have already shown in the preceding section that the spectral weight is concentrated at low frequencies . under the condition that the spin fluctuations are responsible for the pairing of the quasi - particles ,",
    "the longitudinal spin susceptibility gives quite naturally a cutoff frequency of the size of the antiferromagnetic gap ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this implies that for hole dopings away from half - filling , only the intra - valence band matrix elements have to be considered .",
    "the pairing part of the effective hamiltonian can thus formally be written as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the valance band energy .",
    "the direct interaction @xmath101 , which is given by @xmath102 spin indices contains , besides the longitudinal spin fluctuations , also the bare interactions and the charge fluctuations .",
    "the exchange interaction with @xmath103 consists of the transverse spin fluctuations only . in figs .",
    "[ fig10b ] to [ fig12c ] , the direct interaction and the exchange interaction were plotted for different paths of @xmath104 and @xmath105 through the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) for the simple @xmath1 model and the hubbard model , respectively .",
    "the exchange interaction was plotted there as @xmath106 , since it has exactly this form , with negative sign , in the bcs gap equation ( see eq .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) ) .    comparing the graphs for the simple @xmath1 model ( @xmath85 ) with the simple hubbard model",
    ", one can easily see that the @xmath4 term amplifies the attractive parts of the direct interaction , whereas the attractive parts of the exchange interaction remain constant ( see e.  g.  fig .",
    "[ fig11b ] ) .",
    "however , the repulsive parts of the direct interaction and the exchange interaction were both attenuated considerably by increasing @xmath4 ( see e.  g.  fig .",
    "[ fig12b ] ) .",
    "therefore , the pairing of the quasi - particles is favored in the simple @xmath1 model altogether .",
    "finally , we want to solve the bcs gap equation for the effective pairing interaction . starting point is the effective hamiltonian , as obtained in the previous section @xmath107 with this hamiltonian we want to study the superconducting properties of the simple @xmath1 model for different hole doping and different values of the model parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the bcs gap equation becomes @xmath108 here we used the abbreviations @xmath109 the gap equation ( [ 34 ] ) was iterated by assuming different symmetries of the superconducting order parameter , however , only @xmath10-wave solutions turn out to converge",
    ".    to understand this , one has to keep in mind that there are other important quantities , like the cutoff frequency or the density of states at the fermi level , which have an important effect on the magnitude of the superconducting gap .",
    "how the superconducting gap depends on these quantities is qualitatively seen already in the weak - coupling solution of the original bcs equation for an attractive @xmath110-potential @xcite : @xmath111 a stronger coupling @xmath112 is increasing the superconducting gap , while a smaller cutoff frequency @xmath95 is decreasing it .",
    "moreover , if the density of states at the fermi level @xmath113 is reduced , the superconducting gap is getting smaller , as well .",
    "this final point is decisive , since the @xmath4 term is broadening the energy bands considerably , thus reducing the density of states dramatically .",
    "therefore , the fact that the superconducting gap is getting smaller with increasing @xmath4 can be understood within our approximation .",
    "in this paper , we have first shown that the standard hartree - fock approximation can describe the antiferromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 model , especially the single - particle energy bands , in surprisingly good agreement with the qmc simulations .",
    "on the other hand , like for the hubbard model  @xcite , it is unable to reproduce the transition to a @xmath10-wave superconductor observed in the simple @xmath1 model in numerical simulations ( qmc ) .",
    "the standard hartree - fock approximation captures only the `` high - energy '' physics , and is thus capable of reproducing band - widths and the overall features of the single - particle spectral - function .",
    "equivalently , short - range pairing - correlation functions should be well reproduced within this approximation .",
    "this is indeed the case . at short length scales ( as shown in table 1 ) the extended s - wave vertex contribution to the pairing correlation functions is dominant in qmc simulations of the simple t - u - w model .",
    "it is only at _ larger _ distances that the d - wave pairing correlations become dominant .",
    "this crossover from _ short range _ to _ long range _",
    "properties is not reproduced within the standard mean - field approximation .",
    "alternatively , for the t - u - w model with phase factors d - wave pairing dominates in qmc simulations at small length scales ( see table 2 ) .    on the other hand , by including charge and spin fluctuations within a time - dependent hf , or generalized rpa summation of ladder and bubble diagrams , we were able to obtain an effective attraction between the quasi - particles , which is enhanced by @xmath4 .",
    "moreover we obtain a corresponding superconducting order parameter with the correct d - wave symmetry .",
