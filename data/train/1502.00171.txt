    "<S> we report calculations of the electronic structure and optical properties of doped @xmath0-type perovskite basno@xmath1 and layered perovskites . while doped basno@xmath1 retains its transparency for energies below the valence to conduction band onset , the doped layered compounds exhibit below band edge optical conductivity due to transitions from the lowest conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> this gives absorption in the visible for ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is important to minimize this phase in transparent conducting oxide ( tco ) films . </S>",
    "<S> ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 and ba@xmath3sn@xmath1o@xmath5 have strong transitions only in the red and infrared , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus there may be opportunities for using these as wavelength filtering tco .    </S>",
    "<S> transparent conducting oxides ( tco ) are widely used for electrodes in solar energy and display technologies . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the most commonly used material is sn doped in@xmath2o@xmath1 , known as ito . </S>",
    "<S> this is a stable material that can be readily deposited in thin films and has excellent tco performance . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is interest in alternatives to ito both because of a desire to reduce the use of in and to identify tco materials with a range of other properties and functionalities . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for displays , high dc conductivity , low haze and high transparency for the operating wavelength and viewing angle ranges are needed . </S>",
    "<S> transparency outside these ranges is not needed and is often undesirable since heating due to infrared transmission and ultraviolet photons can degrade devices , e.g. in outdoor use . </S>",
    "<S> we note that transparency below the absorber band gap is undesirable in solar photovoltaic applications . </S>",
    "<S> while light filters can be incorporated in various layers of a device architecture , transparent conductors that also act as filters may be useful .    perovskite structure basno@xmath1 doped by trivalent cation substitutions for ba ( e.g. la ) and by sb alloying on the sn site shows promise as an ito alternative . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite importantly , recent studies of high mobility la doped basno@xmath1 transparent conducting films show transport properties that are still dominated by extrinsic defects , specifically dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the implication is that there remains considerable room for even better conductivity with improvements in film perfection . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies suggested that @xmath0-type basno@xmath1 may have substantial tunability , e.g. in the band gap via alloying and strain , @xcite but applications of strain tuning of basno@xmath1 have yet to be demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that it is possible to tailor the spectral transmission of basno@xmath1 by a dimensional reduction strategy .    </S>",
    "<S> we report first principles calculations for doped basno@xmath1 , in relation to members of the ruddlesden - popper homologous series derived from basno@xmath1 by periodic insertion of nominally insulating bao layers . </S>",
    "<S> the first two members of the series are known bulk equilibrium stable phases in the bao  </S>",
    "<S> sno@xmath2 pseudobinary phase diagram that are readily made using common methods . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite perhaps other phases can also be grown , in analogy with the sr - ti - o system . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this is also consistent with the sr - sn - o system , which has a known ruddlesden - popper series . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite kamimura and co - workers have recently shown that members of the sr - sn - o ruddlesden - popper series can show very different luminescence properties when activated . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite furthermore , the members of the ba - sn - o ruddlesden - popper series have good in plane lattice matches with each other and are presumably compatible with each other in thin film form .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental lattice parameters and spacegroups are basno@xmath1 , cubic , @xmath6 @xmath7=4.116  , @xcite ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 , body centered tetragonal , @xmath8 , @xmath7=4.1411  , @xmath9=13.2834  , @xcite and ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 , body centered tetragonal , @xmath8 , @xmath7=4.129  , @xmath9=21.460  . @xcite as discussed below , we also did calculations for the next member of the series , ba@xmath3sn@xmath1o@xmath5 , which is a phase that has not been reported experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> for this we did calculations both using a fully relaxed structure and a partially relaxed structure in which the atomic coordinates were relaxed but the lattice parameters were fixed to interpolated experimental values from the known phases .    </S>",
    "<S> the main first principles calculations were performed using the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method @xcite as implemented in the wien2k code . </S>",
    "<S> we also did calculations to cross - check using the vasp code with hybrid hse06 functional @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe - gga ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    for the lapw calculations , we used well converged basis sets including local orbitals for the semicore states of the alkaline earth elements , the o 2@xmath10 state and the sn @xmath11 state . </S>",
    "<S> we used the standard lapw basis sets rather than the apw+lo method . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the lapw sphere radii were 2.4 bohr , 2.25 bohr and 1.6 bohr for ba , sn and o , respectively , and a basis set cut - off , @xmath12 , set by the criterion @xmath13=7.0 was used , where @xmath14 is the o lapw sphere radius .    </S>",
    "<S> we fixed the lattice parameters to the experimental values and relaxed the internal atomic coordinates of the layered compounds using the pbe - gga . </S>",
    "<S> following the structure optimization , we did electronic structure and optical calculations using the modified becke - johnson type potential functional of tran and blaha , @xcite denoted tb - mbj in the following . </S>",
    "<S> this potential gives band gaps in remarkably good accord with experiment for a wide variety of simple semiconductors and insulators , @xcite including perovskite stannates . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we compared the tb - mbj results for the undoped compounds with hse06 calculations as discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> doping by la was treated using the virtual crystal approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the virtual crystal approximation is an average potential approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it goes beyond rigid bands , and specifically includes composition dependent distortions of the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the virtual crystal approximation is supported by the fact that in these compounds the highly electropositive elements , ba and la , are fully ionized and serve only to stabilize the structure and donate charge to the conducting bands derived from sn and o. ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 has two crystallographically distinct ba sites , _ </S>",

    "<S> the calculated indirect gaps using the tb - mbj potential are 2.82 ev , 4.22 ev and 3.53 ev for basno@xmath1 , ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 and ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated tb - mbj band gap of bulk nacl structure bao , lattice parameter 5.523  , is 3.61 ev , indirect between @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> two aspects that are immediately apparent from the band structures are ( 1 ) the layered compounds show a dispersive @xmath17 band at the conduction band minimum similar to basno@xmath1 and ( 2 ) the layered compounds show little dispersion in the @xmath9-axis direction , so the layering is indeed strongly reflected in the electronic structure . </S>",

    "<S> [ plasma ] gives the in - plane plasma frequencies , @xmath20 for @xmath0-type doping as a function of doping in carriers per sn . </S>",
    "<S> conductivity in metals and degenerately doped semiconductors depends on the plasma frequency , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an effective inverse scattering rate . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , if one assumes similar scattering rates , the conductivity follows a perhaps expected trend following the density of sn ions ( _ i.e. _ falling as the concentration of insulating bao increases ) . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for in - plane conduction , @xmath23(basno@xmath1)@xmath24@xmath23(ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 ) @xmath24@xmath23(ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the bao layers , while not contributing to conduction , also would not be expected to contribute to optical absorption , and therefore the result suggests that the layered compounds could be good tco as well . as discussed below , our optical calculations show that this may be the case for ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 and higher members of the series , but is not the case for ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 .    the good tco behavior of basno@xmath1 can be understood in terms of three main reasons : ( 1 ) the material can be effectively doped @xmath0-type to high carrier concentrations , ( 2 ) it has a highly dispersive sn @xmath17 derived conduction band that leads to high mobility and ( 3 ) there is a large gap between the lowest conduction band at the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) , which is at @xmath19 , and the next conduction band at @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated absorption spectra for virtual crystal doped basno@xmath1 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ basno3-abs ] . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the optical gap increases with carrier concentration . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence both of the electrostatic effect of adding electrons to a band ( electrons added to the sn @xmath17 derived conduction band by doping provide a repulsion to other electrons in this orbital raising the energy of the band ) , and the increase in fermi level within the band as electrons are added . here </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level shift is the larger effect . </S>",
    "<S> for example , with 0.2 electrons per sn , we obtain a fermi level 1.99 ev above the conduction band minimum in our virtual crystal calculations , while the indirect gap between the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum increases by only 0.14 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this latter increase is a non - rigid - band effect . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this band gap there are other small distortions of the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bands - vc ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the increase in apparent optical gap with la doping is possibly consistent with optical absorption spectra of basno@xmath1 and ( ba , la)sno@xmath1 obtained by kim and co - workers , @xcite whose experimental spectra show such an increase . </S>",
    "<S> however , in view of the broadening of the reported experimental spectra with la addition further measurements would be desirable .    </S>",
    "<S> the band structures of ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 and ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 do not show large gaps above the cbm , but instead show other bands within 3 ev of the cbm . </S>",
    "<S> these arise from the dimensional reduction , specifically the strongly reduced hopping along the @xmath26 , @xmath9-axis direction , which narrows the conduction bands . additionally , in ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 , there are two perovskite layers in the perovskite block , which leads to a band structure with pairs of bands in the @xmath26=0 plane that are characterized by even or odd symmetry with respect to reflection in the bao plane between the sno@xmath2 layers . </S>",
    "<S> such pairs of bands are then strongly connected by dipole transitions for electric field polarization along the @xmath9-axis direction , but not for in - plane polarization , _ i.e. _ not for light propagating along the @xmath9-axis direction .    </S>",
    "<S> other consequences of the dimensional reduction are a higher density of states near the cbm corresponding to the near 2d electronic structure ( note the flatness of the lowest band along the @xmath27-@xmath19 direction ) ; a 2d electronic structure has a high , constant density of states near the band edge , while a 3d band structure has a lower initial density of states , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 relative to the cbm . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly seen in the densities of states ( dos ) , shown for the conduction bands in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dos ] . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the dos for basno@xmath1 shows a smooth increase with energy , while prominent steps corresponding to band onsets are present for the layered compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the consequence of this stepped dos is that in 2d the doping dependence of the fermi level , @xmath30 , will be weaker , with the result that higher doping levels might be possible , and that following arguments given elsewhere the thermopower will be strongly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the conductivity , @xmath23 in plane is generically expected to remain similar to the 3d compound at the expense of a very strong reduction in @xmath9-axis conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this means that use of ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 or ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 films as conducting oxides would require the production of textured films .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical conductivities of the doped compounds are given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cond ] , showing both in - plane and out - of - plane directions . </S>",
    "<S> these plots include a drude contribution , with the drude weight from the calculated @xmath20 and an assumed broadening , @xmath31=0.1 . although undoped ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 is the compound with the highest band gap , it shows strong optical conductivity ( and absorption ) in the visible for light polarization in the @xmath9-axis direction , but low optical conductivity for polarization in the plane , which is the case for normal incidence . </S>",
    "<S> this might suggest that ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 could be used as a transparent conductor for normal incident light . </S>",
    "<S> this may , however , be misleading , since in reality the disorder would lead to symmetry breaking , which could then result in some absorption for normal incident light as well . in any case , this absorption is a consequence of interband transitions from the lowest conduction band to higher bands near the zone center .    </S>",
    "<S> ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 shows different behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it displays very strong interband transitions for @xmath9-axis polarized light in the infrared and red ( below @xmath32 2 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> these lead to high peaks in the optical conductivity for @xmath9-axis polarization even at moderate doping . </S>",
    "<S> this polarization involves dipole transitions between bands with opposite reflection symmetry in the plane between the sno@xmath2 layers as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the band making up the cbm has even reflection symmetry , with an onset of odd reflection symmetry states 1.7 ev above the cbm . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 does not show significant absorption in the visible above 2 ev for either light polarization , but would be expected to be strongly absorbing below 2 ev for electric field out of plane and in the presence of disorder for both polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the insertion of bao layers into basno@xmath1 breaks the translational symmetry along the @xmath9-axis direction . </S>",
    "<S> this then allows dipole transitions for electric field polarization along the @xmath9-axis since the bands folded back to @xmath19 are from different original crystal momenta along @xmath26 ( note that the dipole operator is equivalent to a momentum operator ) .    as mentioned , we also did calculations for hypothetical ba@xmath3sn@xmath1o@xmath5 , which is the next member of the homologous series . </S>",
    "<S> for this , we used lattice parameters based on interpolation using the experimental lattice parameters of basno@xmath1 , ba@xmath3sno@xmath3 and ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we then fully relaxed the internal atomic coordinates within this cell . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice parameters used were from interpolation , @xmath7=4.125  , and @xmath9=29.637  . </S>",
    "<S> full relaxation with the pbe - gga yielded slightly larger lattice parameters of @xmath7=4.202  , and @xmath9=30.170  , also with relaxation of the internal atomic coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated band gaps are 3.24 ev for the interpolated structure and 2.64 ev for the larger volume cell with fully relaxed lattice parameters . the band structure for the interpolated lattice parameters </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bands ] . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane plasma frequency and density of states and optical conductivities are shown along with those of the other compounds . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , its properties generally interpolate between those of basno@xmath1 and ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the energetics of the known compounds , along with those of hypothetical compounds based on addition of an extra bao layer between the perovskite blocks in the series , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ ba@xmath33sn@xmath1o@xmath34 , and the next member of the series , ba@xmath33sn@xmath3o@xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting convex hull for the bao - sno@xmath2 pseudobinary is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ hull ] . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations were done using the pbe - gga with fully relaxed structures , to get a consistent set of energies . as seen </S>",
    "<S> , there is a strong tendency towards compound formation in this pseudobinary . </S>",
    "<S> the stable compounds are basno@xmath1 , ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 and ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the other compounds are above the convex hull , meaning that they are not predicted to be ground state phases in this pseudobinary . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are very close to the hull , within 0.02 ev / atom ( @xmath32 240 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly below the uncertainty of our density functional calculations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore what can be concluded is that these phases are either on or slightly above the convex hull . </S>",
    "<S> based on these results it is likely that they can be stabilized in thin films where kinetic constraints may prevent phase separation , @xcite and perhaps also under other conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental results have shown that heavily @xmath0-type doped basno@xmath1 is promising as a high performance tco with good conductivity and optical transparency in the visible . </S>",
    "<S> layered perovskite variants of this material can be readily made , and it is likely that they can be layered with the cubic perovskite material based on the similar chemistry and in - plane lattice parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it may well be that conventionally made films incorporate some fraction of these phases . </S>",
    "<S> the present calculations show that these phases would not necessarily be harmful for the dc conductivity especially if a high degree of texture is present . however , we find that the presence of doped ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 would be harmful to the visible light transparency . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible in fact that some of the variable results seen in experiments are due to the presence of different amounts of ba@xmath2sno@xmath3 related to various amounts of sn deficiency </S>",
    "<S> . it would be desirable to minimize the occurrence of this phase to improve the transparency . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the occurrence of bi - layer ba@xmath1sn@xmath2o@xmath4 and higher members of the series such as ba@xmath3sn@xmath1o@xmath5 may not be detrimental and may add useful functionality , such as energy selective filtering . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a related concept was recently developed and exploited to produce low loss , room temperature tunable dielectrics based on srtio@xmath1 , specifically using the sr@xmath36ti@xmath37o@xmath38 ruddlesden - popper phases with @xmath0@xmath393 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the present results indicate that it will be interesting to experimentally explore the incorporation of ruddlesden - popper phases into n - type ba - sn - o tco films as a functional tuning parameter .    </S>",
