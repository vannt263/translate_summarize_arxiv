    "the quantum discrete fourier transform ( qft ) is the fundamental ingredient of many principal quantum algorithms , known to provide substantial speed - up over their classical counterparts @xcite , including shor s order finding , factorization and the discrete logarithm @xcite , deutsch s algorithm @xcite and phase estimation @xcite .",
    "being at the heart of quantum computation qft has become a textbook example of the potential superiority of quantum over classical computers and thus it has inspired extensive research aiming at the implementation of this transformation in different physical systems .",
    "experimental demonstrations include the composition of two- and three - qubit qft in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , neutral molecules @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , and semiclassical realizations with trapped ions @xcite and photonic qubits @xcite .",
    "these realizations use predominantly the cooley - tuckey algorithm @xcite , which gives an efficient implementation of qft with a polynomial number o(@xmath0 ) of conditional gates , with @xmath1 being the number of qubits . despite the mathematical efficiency of this algorithm ,",
    "however , the attempts to scale the number of qubits have quickly come across a serious obstacle : the number of gates and the ensuing physical operations with limited precision still grow rapidly with the size of the problem .",
    "they reach prohibitively large values before approaching even moderate computational scales .",
    "therefore one must seek for more realistic implementation models which require less resources .",
    "one way to go is by decomposing qft directly into more favourable gates , which can be realized naturally in the particular physical system .    in this work we present a mathematical construction of qft , which is a modification of the cooley - tuckey scheme .",
    "our circuit is suited for a broad range of systems described by ising - type hamiltonians of the form [ hamiltonian ] = -_k < l=1^j_kl^(k)_z^(l)_z , where @xmath2 represent the spins and @xmath3 represent coupling strengths . examples for such systems are nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , ion traps @xcite , spin chains .",
    "our proposal has two principal advantages .",
    "first , the sequences of conditional gates , which are the major stumbling block to qft , are now carried out by simple time evolutions driven by the hamiltonian over certain time intervals .",
    "thus in our implementation qft is realized with a series of one - qubit gates applied at particular times .",
    "this implies that , second , the number of physical interactions with the system is reduced .",
    "we also show how to obtain quadratically faster qft by applying the conditional interactions simultaneously .",
    "we include an explicit discussion of the physical realization of the proposed scheme with trapped ions .",
    "the @xmath4-dimensional qft is defined through its action on the computational basis states @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 by f _ = _ k=0 ^",
    "-1 e^2i n k/. it is a unitary transformation , which maps each state @xmath10 into an equal superposition of all states each imprinted with a particular phase .    a circuit that implements qft is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ( top ) .",

    "this circuit offers an exponentially faster implementation ( with @xmath13 gates ) compared to the best known classical algorithm for fast fourier transform ( with @xmath14 gates ) . despite this formal superiority ,",
    "however , this implementation has proved difficult to scale due to the sequences of the cphase gates .",
    "hence other mathematical constructions of qft are desirable , which use more favourable gates for the particular physical system rather than the cphase gates",

    "based on the cooley - tuckey scheme , in the following we give a mathematical construction of qft , which is adapted for a class of systems described by the hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian realizes long - range spin - spin coupling and , since it is time - independent , the evolution matrix is @xmath21 , or [ propagator ] u=(i_k < l=1^n_kl_z^(k)_z^(l ) ) . below we will also use the notation @xmath22 $ ] when we want to highlight the dependence of @xmath23 on time .",
    "note that @xmath23 yields control - phase shifts between all pairs of spins , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding phase is @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath27 , which will substitute the cphase gate , is merely delivered by free evolution after time @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the required free evolution time might be different for each @xmath29 ; however , if the coupling @xmath3 can be tailored such , that all @xmath30 are identical , all phases @xmath29 can be acquired in a single step . in nmr , there exist proposals for the implementation of the two - qubit cnot gate and multi - qubit gates , based on always - on interactions ( by refocussing other interactions , and thus `` wasting them '' ) @xcite .",
    "our gate set comprises a rotation @xmath31 , a phase gate @xmath32 , and the entangling gate @xmath33 .",
    "the indices indicate qubit numbers .",
    "we will also use implementations , where the phase gate is incorporated in the rotation to form @xmath34 according to the rule @xmath35 .",
    "such phased rotation can be obtained with a simple phase shift @xmath36 in the driving field implementing @xmath37 .",
    "we have [ gates ] @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "sometimes we will drop the phase dependence in the gates , e.g. @xmath27 will be written more concisely as @xmath40 .",
    "we derive our implementation from the circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( top ) , where we replace the cphase gates with free evolution @xmath17 and phase gates @xmath41 . to this end",
    ", we note that a cphase gate @xmath42 acting on qubits @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be written as @xmath43 and , using the identity @xmath44 , we get @xmath45 . after expanding the product",
    "we arrive at _ kl()=e^i_k()_l()u_kl(),where all gates commute .",
    "hence , up to an unimportant global phase , which will be omitted in what follows , a cphase gate can be achieved with two phase gates and the free evolution gate .",
    "next we proceed with reconstructing the gate sequence from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( top ) , where our aim is to obtain a circuit involving only free evolution gates and a minimum number of single - qubit gates .",
    "we note that the gate series , encircled with a dash line , can be expressed as @xmath46 \\\\ & \\ph_1\\left(\\tfrac{\\phi_1}{4}\\right)\\ph_2\\left(\\tfrac{\\phi_2}{4}\\right)\\ph_3\\left(\\tfrac{\\phi_3}{4}\\right)\\ph_4\\left(\\tfrac{\\phi_4}{4}\\right ) , \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 or @xmath48 for any @xmath4 . if we substitute the phases from eq . , we get @xmath49 we concatenate such sequences of cphase gates with hadamard gates , according to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( top ) , and then we rearrange the so - obtained circuit such that all phase gates to the left ( right ) of the hadamard gates are combined in a single phase gate placed at the beginning ( end ) of the circuit .",
    "thus we reconstruct the entire circuit in the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( middle ) .",
    "therefore , the fourier transform over @xmath50 qubits can be achieved with the following gate sequence ( in operator form , to be read from right to left ) @xmath51 or , in the general-@xmath1 case , @xmath52 where [ seriesu ] p_n = e^i_l = n+1 ^ 2^n - l^(n)_z^(l)_z .",
    "we will refer to eq . as the consecutive sequence . here",
    "@xmath53 is the hadamard gate , applied to qubit @xmath11 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are phase gates , applied to all @xmath4 qubits at the beginning and at the end of the circuit , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in a more compact form",
    "we have @xmath60 note that a phase gate represents a mere shift of the phase of the driving field , rather than a physical modification of the qubit .",
    "as such , it is not associated to any infidelity .    in the rest of this section",
    "we show that by a proper tailoring of the coupling matrix @xmath61 it is possible to execute simultaneously the whole sequence @xmath62 ( cf .",

    "note that no net phase shift must take place between ions 2 , 3 and 4 in the application of @xmath69 and 3 and 4 in the application of @xmath70 .",
    "this leads to [ sys2 ] @xmath71 in eq .",
    "we account for the fact that @xmath72 and @xmath73 commute with the hadamard gate on ion 2 .",
    "therefore they can be combined into a single gate @xmath74 , which must produce no net effect .",
    "it is important to note that the righthand side of eqs . and",
    "is defined up to the addition of @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is an arbitrary integer , @xmath77 .",
    "this offers larger flexibility for the values of @xmath61 .",

    "a simple example is when @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 .",
    "below we illustrate our method with homogeneous magnetic - gradient ion traps @xcite , where the implementation of the @xmath23-gate is appealingly simple : it occurs naturally in the time evolution of the energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "consider a system of @xmath4 ions , confined strongly in two orthogonal directions ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) and by a weaker potential along a third direction ( @xmath76 ) , known as the trap axis .",

    "two internal levels of each ion , which we denote as @xmath92 and @xmath93 , form a qubit .",
    "these can be a pair of hyperfine ground states , serving as effective spin-1/2 states .",
    "in addition , a magnetic field @xmath94 is applied , such that the ions experience a gradient along the trap axis .      the hamiltonian of the system of @xmath4 ions , up to second order in the ions vibrational motion , is given by [ hamiltonian2 ] = _",

    "the second term describes @xmath4 axial collective vibrational modes with frequencies @xmath100 ; @xmath101 and @xmath102 are respectively the creation and annihilation operators of mode @xmath103 .",

    "thus the spin - spin coupling is defined by the values of the magnetic field gradient and the shape of the potential surface around the equilibrium positions of the ions . in the following",
    "we will discover that only the third term is essential for the implementation of qft .    for the complete description of the system",

    "we have @xmath112 .",
    "we assume that initially the system resides in a pure state , which is a product of a spin part and a motional part , @xmath113 .",
    "this happens , for example , when the spins are prepared in a particular state as part of the initialization of the system . because the interactions that we will consider below do not couple the vibrational motion to the spin states , the latter are evolved independently of the motional states and thus @xmath107 preserves its product form over time .",
    "therefore with @xmath111 we will refer only to the spin - driving part of the propagator , as we will be only interested in the dynamics of the logical basis states . for this reason we will omit the second term from the hamiltonian . moreover , because @xmath111 is independent of the vibrational state and it does not matter whether the vibrational state is cooled to the ground state or not .      in our implementation we will use two bases , shown in fig .",
