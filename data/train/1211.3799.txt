    "quasi - monte carlo ( qmc ) rules are equal weight quadrature rules @xmath5 which can be used to approximate integrals of the form @xmath6^s } f({\\boldsymbol{x } } ) { \\,\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{x}},\\ ] ] see @xcite for more information . in qmc rules ,",
    "the quadrature points @xmath7 are chosen according to some deterministic algorithm .",
    "one can show that the convergence rate of the integration error @xmath8^s } f({\\boldsymbol{x } } ) { \\,\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ ] depends on the smoothness of the integrand and some property of the quadrature points .",
    "there are several deterministic construction methods for the quadrature points .",
    "one such method yields so - called digital nets .",
    "these yield a convergence of the integration error of @xmath9 for functions of bounded variation @xcite .",
    "higher order digital nets , using an interlacing factor of @xmath10 , yield a convergence rate of order @xmath11 for integrands with square integrable partial mixed derivatives of order @xmath3 in each variable @xcite .",
    "an alternative to digital nets are lattice rules @xcite . in this case , for a given positive integer @xmath12 one chooses a vector @xmath13 called the generating vector and defines the quadrature points by @xmath14 here , for a real number @xmath15 , the braces @xmath16 denote the fractional part , i.e. , modulo  @xmath4 . for vectors ,",
    "the fractional part is taken component wise .",
    "it is well known that there are generating vectors for lattice rules for which the integration error converges with order @xmath17 ( @xmath2 ) for smoothness @xmath18 , but with the restriction that @xmath19 and its partial derivatives up to order @xmath20 in each variable have to be periodic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  18 , p.  120 ) and @xcite .",
    "fast computer search algorithms for such vectors are known from @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to be able to benefit from the fast rate of convergence , one needs to apply a transformation which makes the integrand ( and its partial derivatives ) periodic .",
    "this can cause some problems though and is not always recommended @xcite . since arbitrarily",
    "high rates of convergence can be obtained using digital nets for nonperiodic functions , the question arises whether this is also possible for lattice rules . until now",
    ", lattice rules achieve a convergence rate of at most @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) for nonperiodic integrands ( via estimates of the star - discrepancy @xcite ) .",
    "if one applies the so - called tent transformation and a random shift , this rate of convergence can be improved to @xmath23 for any @xmath2 for the worst - case error in an unanchored sobolev space of smoothness @xmath24 , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present quadrature rules which achieve a convergence rate of order @xmath17 , @xmath2 , for nonperiodic functions with smoothness @xmath1 .",
    "the way we measure smoothness in this paper is slightly different from the setting used in , for instance , higher order digital nets @xcite though .",
    "we consider functions @xmath19 which can be represented by a cosine series .",
    "note that every continuous function @xmath25)$ ] can be represented by a cosine series ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) for this basis over @xmath26 $ ] ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that the functions @xmath27 are @xmath28-orthogonal and complete .",
    "as mentioned above , the `` smoothness '' of the cosine series in our context is measured by the rate of decay of the cosine coefficients . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider a one - dimensional function @xmath29 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] given by its cosine series @xmath30 where @xmath31      \\displaystyle \\int_0 ^ 1 f(x ) \\sqrt{2 } \\cos(\\pi k x ) { \\,\\mathrm{d}}x & \\text { for } k\\in { \\mathbb{n}}.    \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum over the even frequencies is a @xmath4-periodic function @xmath32 over @xmath33 $ ] . if the coefficients @xmath34 decay with order @xmath35 then @xmath32 is @xmath3-times differentiable in the classical sense .",
    "however , this does not apply to the sum over the odd coefficients .",
    "for instance , the cosine series for @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 k \\text { odd}}}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{k^2 } \\cos(\\pi k x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence the odd coefficients converge with order @xmath38 only , although @xmath15 is infinitely times differentiable .",
    "below we introduce a reproducing kernel hilbert space based on cosine series , with the smoothness measured by the decay rate of the cosine coefficients .",
    "although the smoothness of a cosine series measured by the differentiability of the series can be larger than the decay rate of the cosine coefficients suggests , the opposite can not happen .",
    "that is , we show that the reproducing kernel hilbert space based on cosine series is embedded in the unanchored sobolev space with the same value of the smoothness parameter . the case of smoothness @xmath4",
    "provides an exception , since there the cosine series space and the unanchored sobolev space coincide .",
    "various reproducing kernel hilbert spaces are introduced in section  [ sec_rkhs ] and their embeddings are studied in section  [ sec_embeddings ] .    in this paper",
    "we present two methods which allow us to achieve a higher convergence rate for smoother nonperiodic functions using lattice rules , namely :    1 .",
    "application of the tent transformation to the integration nodes ; 2 .",
    "symmetrization of the integration nodes .    the _ tent transformation _ , @xmath39 \\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ]",
    ", @xmath40 is a lebesgue measure preserving function .",
    "the idea of using this transformation in conjunction with a random shift for integration based on lattice rules comes from hickernell @xcite and was also used in @xcite for digital nets .",
    "in contrast to these works , here we do not rely on a random element in our quadrature rules .",
    "we show that a tent transformed lattice rule achieves an integration error of order @xmath41 , for any @xmath2 , for functions belonging to a certain reproducing kernel hilbert space of cosine series with smoothness parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this result follows by showing that the worst - case error in the cosine series space for a tent - transformed lattice rule is the same as the worst - case error in a korobov space of smooth periodic functions using lattice rules .",
    "thus all the results for integration in korobov spaces using lattice rules @xcite also apply for integration in the cosine series space using tent - transformed lattice rules .",
    "in particular for smoothness @xmath4 , this yields deterministic point sets for numerical integration in unanchored sobolev spaces with the same tractability properties as for numerical integration in the korobov space .",
    "furthermore , we also use symmetrized lattice rules .",
    "we show that these rules achieve the optimal order of convergence for integration of sums of products of cosine series and fourier series .",
    "we apply the transformation @xmath42 to each possible set of coordinates separately , so that if we start off with @xmath12 points we get @xmath43 points ( see section  [ sec : symm ] ) .",
    "this symmetrization approach is also mentioned in @xcite and is one of the symmetry groups applied in the construction of cubature formulae , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we prove that a lattice rule symmetrized this way achieves an integration error of order @xmath44 , @xmath2 , for functions belonging to a certain reproducing kernel hilbert space of cosine series and fourier series with smoothness parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the advantage of symmetrized lattice rules is that functions of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a nonnegative integer , are integrated exactly and hence only the smoothness of the periodic part determines the convergence rate .",
    "note that the decay rate of the cosine series coefficients of the periodic part and of the fourier series coefficients part coincides with the classical smoothness .",
    "thus the problem with functions where the smoothness in terms of differentiability differs from the rate of decay of the cosine series is overcome using symmetrization .",
    "for instance , the function @xmath47 is integrated exactly using symmetrization . however , a disadvantage of the symmetrization compared to the tent transformation is that the number of function evaluations grows exponential in the dimension and therefore symmetrization is only useful in smaller dimensions .    for both methods ,",
    "the rates of convergence we obtain are essentially optimal by an adaption of the lower bound of bakhvalov @xcite , which is presented in section  [ sec_lower_bound ] .    in the next section",
    "we introduce four reproducing kernel hilbert spaces , the unanchored sobolev space , the korobov space , the cosine series space and the sum of the cosine and korobov space .",
    "since the unanchored sobolev space and the korobov space are frequently studied in the literature , we study the relations among these four spaces in section  [ sec_embeddings ] to put our results into context .",
    "it is shown that the korobov space and the cosine series space differ , but both are embedded in the sum of the cosine series and korobov space , which is itself embedded in the unanchored sobolev space . in section  [ sec_num_int ]",
    "we study numerical integration in the cosine series space using tent - transformed lattice rules and numerical integration in the sum of the cosine series and korobov space using symmetrized lattice rules .",
    "numerical results are presented in section  [ sec_num_res ] and a conclusion is presented in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",

    "in such a case there is an exponential dependence on the number of dimensions and the symmetrized rule is then the preferred choice if the dimension is small enough ( this can also be seen in the left bottom panel which has @xmath431 for @xmath422 in @xmath428 dimensions ) .",
    "we remark that the graphs , where one replaces the time in the abscissa by the number of points @xmath12 in figure  [ fig : f1-f4 ] , are very similar to the ones shown in figure  [ fig : f1-f4 ] .",
    "in this paper we have shown that it is possible to obtain a convergence rate of @xmath41 for any @xmath438 for sufficiently smooth integrands for lattice - type rules also for nonperiodic functions . previously , the only qmc rules with such properties where higher order digital nets @xcite .",
    "however , the function spaces we consider here are smaller than the usual smooth sobolev spaces used for higher order digital nets .",
    "since for smoothness @xmath4 the unanchored sobolev space and the half - period cosine space coincide , we obtain that tent - transformed lattice rules achieve the same convergence behavior and tractability results as lattice rules in korobov spaces .",
