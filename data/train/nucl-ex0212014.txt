    "the physics motivation of the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion program at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is to study nuclear matter at extremely high temperature and energy density with the hope to reach a new form of matter called the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . among the various probes of the qgp state , hadrons carry important information about the collision dynamics along with the spatial and temporal evolution of the system from the early stage of the collisions to the final state interactions .    for studies of hadron physics at rhic",
    ", the phenix experiment  @xcite demonstrates good capability for particle identification ( pid ) for both charged hadrons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and neutral pions over a broad momentum range .",
    "the charged hadrons can be identified with time - of - flight measurements in two different detectors : ( 1 ) a high resolution time - of - flight wall ( tof ) and , ( 2 ) an electro - magnetic calorimeter ( emc ) , in conjunction with the tracking system in the phenix central arm spectrometers and the beam counter , which provides the start timing and the event vertex determination .",
    "the tracking system in the central arm consists of drift chambers ( dc ) , three layers of pad chambers ( pc ) , and time expansion chambers ( tec ) .",
    "the phenix central arms cover @xmath7 in pseudo - rapidity , and cover @xmath8 with the tof and @xmath9 by emc in azimuth .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 separation can be achieved up to 2 and 4 gev/@xmath12 in @xmath13 , respectively , using the tof detector , which has a 120 ps timing resolution .",
    "neutral pions are identified with the emc via the @xmath14 decay channel up to 10 gev/@xmath12 in @xmath13 using the full statistics taken during run ii at rhic in au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    ", @xmath4 ( triangles ) in the 05% most central events ( upper panels ) and 6091.4% most peripheral events ( lower panels ) at @xmath0 = 200 gev in au+au collisions .",
    "the left panels show positive particles and the right panels show negative particles .",
    "the error bars are statistical only.,width=453 ]     for protons and anti - protons ( triangles ) , kaons ( squares ) and pions ( circles ) .",
    "the left panel shows positive particles and right panel shows negative particles .",
    "the open symbols indicate the data for 130 gev  @xcite while the filled symbols indicate the data for 200 gev in au+au collisions.,width=453 ]    we have measured the transverse momentum distributions for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 at mid - rapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev over a broad momentum range over various centrality selections . to identify the charged particles , the high resolution tof counter is used in this analysis .",
    "we use about 4 million minimum bias events .",
    "the data are classified into 11 centrality bins expressed in percent of the total inelastic cross section .",
    "the spectra for each particle species are corrected for geometrical acceptance , decay in flight , multiple scattering , and tracking efficiency using a single particle monte carlo simulation .",
    "a multiplicity - dependent track reconstruction efficiency is also determined and applied by embedding simulated tracks into real events .",
    "the upper two panels in figure  [ fig : spectra_cent ] show the @xmath15 distributions for identified hadrons in the most central events ( 05% ) in 200 gev au+au collisions for positive ( left ) and negative ( right ) particles .",
    "the lower two panels show the most peripheral events ( 6091.4% ) . in each panel , the data are presented up to 1.8 gev/@xmath12 for charged pions and kaons , and 3.8 gev/@xmath12 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the low @xmath15 region of the most central events ,",
    "the data indicate that the inverse slope increases with the particle mass .",
    "also , the shape of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra have a shoulder - arm shape while the pion spectra have a concave shape . on the other hand , in the most peripheral events ,",
    "the spectra are almost parallel to each other .",
    "this mass dependence of the slopes and shapes of the spectra for protons in the central events can be explained by a radial flow picture . at around 2.0 gev/@xmath12 in central events ,",
    "the proton yield becomes comparable to the pion yield .",
    "a similar behavior is also seen for negatively charged particles .    in order to quantify the observed mass dependence of the slopes ,",
    "the mean transverse momenta @xmath16 are extracted for 11 centrality selections and for each particle species .",
    "the @xmath15 spectra are extrapolated to below and above the measured range using a power law function for pions , an @xmath17 exponential function for kaons , and a boltzmann function for @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in figure",
    "[ fig : meanpt ] , the centrality dependence of @xmath16 for identified charged hadrons are shown together with the 130 gev data points  @xcite . in both the 200 gev and 130 gev data , @xmath16 for all particle species",
    "increases from the most peripheral to the most central events and also increases with particle mass .",
    "the dependence of @xmath16 on particle mass suggests the existence of a collective hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "the dependence on the number of participant nucleons ( @xmath18 ) calculated using a glauber model  @xcite may be due to an increasing radial expansion from peripheral to central events .",
    "particle composition at high @xmath15 is also interesting in order to understand baryon production and transport , system evolution , and the interplay between soft processes and jet quenching in hard processes . in figure",
    "[ fig : ppi_ratio ] , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 ratios are shown .",
    "for the denominator of the ratio @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we use two independent measurements with different subsystems : ( 1 ) @xmath15 spectra for @xmath1 up to 2 gev/@xmath12 identified using the tof , ( 2 ) neutral pions results from 1 gev/@xmath12 to 3.8 gev/@xmath12 measured using the emc .",
    "both the @xmath19 and @xmath20 ratios have a clear centrality dependence .",
    "the data shows that these ratios in central collisions reach unity at a @xmath13 of 2@xmath213 gev/@xmath12 , while they saturate at around @xmath13 of 0.3  0.4 in peripheral collisions .",
    "this observed behavior in central events may be attributed to the composition of two effects including a larger flow effect for protons ( and @xmath4 ) compared to pions , and a pion suppression effect at high @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "( left ) and @xmath20 ( right ) ratios as a function of @xmath15 for the 05 % and 6091.4% centrality selections .",
    "lines along the data points show the @xmath15-independent systematic error bands .",
    "the error bars show the statistical and @xmath15-dependent systematic errors , summed in quadrature.,width=529 ]",
    "we present results on identified hadrons in au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev at mid - rapidity over different centrality selections from the phenix experiment .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are measured and we observe a mass dependence of the slopes and shapes of the identified charged spectra in central events .",
    "however , they are almost parallel to each other in the most peripheral events .",
    "also , the mean transverse momentum for all particle species increases from peripheral to central events , and with particle mass .",
    "the ratios @xmath19 and @xmath20 up to 3.8 gev/@xmath12 are also measured by using the combined results for charged and neutral pions . in central collisions ,",
    "the ratio reaches unity at a @xmath13 of 2@xmath21 3 gev/@xmath12 and saturates at a @xmath13 around 0.3  0.4 gev/@xmath12 in peripheral collisions .",
