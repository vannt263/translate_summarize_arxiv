    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model predicts that the typical mass of virialized objects in the universe increases with time .",
    "this means that the most massive or hottest galaxy clusters ( @xmath4  kev ) should be the objects that have formed most recently .",
    "in fact , x - ray observations have shown that the hottest clusters are often ` major - merger ' clusters .",
    "these clusters are now growing through the mergers .",
    "for example , cluster 1e  065756 ( @xmath5  kev ) has a clear bow shock associated with a merger ; a smaller cluster is penetrating a larger cluster with a velocity of 3000@xmath6 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these hottest clusters are rarely ` cool core clusters ' , which have a distinct cool core and are almost isothermal outside the core .",
    "this is probably because cool cores are destroyed by cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "cluster mergers may accelerate relativistic particles at shocks and in turbulent regions in the icm @xcite .",
    "with bepposax , non - thermal hard x - ray emission from relativistic particles has been detected from several clusters such as the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "most of them are actually merging clusters @xcite .",
    "however , the detections are still controversial @xcite , and confirmation with other instruments would be highly desirable .",
    "the suzaku hxd has an improved sensitivity for hard x - rays @xcite , and attempts have been made to detect non - thermal hard x - ray emission from clusters .",
    "so far , no firm detections have been reported @xcite .",
    "the ophiuchus cluster is one of the hottest known clusters .",
    "it has been observed with several satellites , such as heao  1 @xcite , exosat @xcite , tenma @xcite , and ginga @xcite .",
    "previous observations with asca and bepposax showed that the temperature of the icm is @xmath7  kev @xcite .",
    "in addition to the high temperature , this cluster has a few interesting features .",
    "first , it has been reported to have a complicated temperature distribution , in particular , the temperature of its western part reaches @xmath8  kev @xcite .",
    "this temperature is comparable to that observed in 1e  065756 @xcite .",
    "thus , this cluster may be undergoing a major merger that induces the motion of the icm with a velocity of @xmath9 km s@xmath10 .",
    "second , non - thermal hard x - ray emission may have been detected from the cluster .",
    "@xcite searched for non - thermal emission with bepposax and found some evidence at a @xmath11 level .",
    "recently , @xcite detected non - thermal emission from the center of the cluster with integral at a @xmath12 level .",
    "however , a recent long exposure with the swift / bat instrument failed to detect any nonthermal emission , and set an upper limit below the claimed integral detection @xcite .    in this paper , we report our observational results of the ophiuchus cluster with suzaku .",
    "thanks to the low background of suzaku @xcite , we can obtain an x - ray spectrum even in regions far from the cluster center ; we discuss the temperature and metal abundance distributions in the icm .",
    "the high spectral resolution of the xis @xcite on board suzaku also enables us to measure or limit the bulk motion of the icm .",
    "moreover , the hard x - ray detector , hxd , can constrain the non - thermal emission from the cluster , which can be compared with the integral and swift / bat results .    in this paper , we assume cosmological parameters of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . since the cluster redshift is",

    "by measuring the redshifts of metal lines in x - ray spectra , we can estimate the velocity of the icm .",
    "there have been a number of previous attempts to measure bulk motions in the icm using x - ray line shifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the xiss on board suzaku have an excellent spectral resolution , they are suitable for such studies @xcite . in this section",

    "we treat the three xis chips separately in order to allow for the gain difference among them .",

    "the mn k@xmath47 line from the calibration sources and the fe  k lines from the icm are each fitted with the gaussian components .",

    "the central energy of the mn k@xmath47 line determined by this fit is referred as @xmath48 .",
    "the gain correction factor is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the true energy ( 5.895  kev ) .",
    "typically , @xmath51 , and the uncertainty of @xmath52 is @xmath53 . on the other hand , we determine the redshift of the icm , @xmath54 , through a spectral fit that is the same as that in section  [ sec : spec ] but for each chip .",

    "the values averaged for the three xiss are shown in table  [ tab : spec ] . for regions w and s ,",
    "only data for fi chips ( xis  0 , and 3 ) are shown because the bi chip ( xis  1 ) is less sensitive to hot gas ( @xmath57  kev ) and the redshifts can not be constrained .",
    "the redshifts in figure  [ fig : redshift ] are consistent with being constant and the average is @xmath58 , which agrees with the optical redshift of the cluster ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the difference of the maximum ( c - nw ) and minimum redshift ( w ) in table  [ tab : spec ] is @xmath59 , which means that the velocity difference between different regions is @xmath60 .",
    "the suzaku hxd pin detector is sensitive to hard x - rays ( @xmath61  kev ) and has a wider fov ( @xmath62 full width at half maximum , fwhm ) than that of the xis ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "although the center of the hxd field is shifted from that of the xis field by @xmath63 , the shift is much smaller than the size of the hxd field .",
    "thus , all of the five hxd fields ( corresponding to the xis fields c , n , w , s , and e ) cover at least partially the central region of the cluster , where integral detected hard x - ray excess emission @xcite .    after correcting for dead time , the exposure times of the five fields are 12.6 , 18.1 , 19.4 , 20.0 , 20.1  ks for c , n , w , s , and e , respectively .",
    "we fit the hxd spectra with a thermal model ( apec ) , which represents the icm , as well as a cxb component .",
    "we first simultaneously fit the spectra of the five fields .",
    "a redistribution matrix file for the hxd nominal position is used for the icm emission .",
    "the arfs of the icm emission for each spectrum are generated with hxdarfgen and addarf by assuming that the emission follows the same beta model that we adopted for the xis ( section  [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "we fix the metal abundance of the apec model at @xmath64 and the redshift at @xmath16 ( optical redshift ) .",
    "the cxb is assumed to be uniform in a @xmath65 field , and a corresponding redistribution matrix file is employed .",
    "the spectrum of the cxb is represented by a power - law model multiplied by a highecut model in xspec .",

    "thus , the free parameters for the fit are the temperature and normalization of the apec model . while the temperature is common , the normalization is allowed to vary among the five spectra .",
    "we do not consider the galactic absorption because it does not affect the results in the hxd energy band .",
    "the nxb spectra created from the pinnxb_ver2.0_tuned nxb model are employed as a normal nxb .",
    "we find that the five spectra can be fitted with the thermal model with a temperature of @xmath68  kev .",
    "the normalizations of the five spectra agree with each other within @xmath69% .",
    "we thus combine the five spectra into one and perform a fit again .",
    "the nxb spectra and the arf are combined , correspondingly .",
    "the result of the fit is @xmath70  kev ( table  [ tab : spec ] and figure  [ fig : hxd ] ) .",
    "the spectrum does not require an extra hard x - ray component .",
    "the flux of the thermal component in 2080 kev band is @xmath71 , which is about 20% higher than that expected from the bepposax pds observations @xcite .",
    "we note that the systematic uncertainty in the hxd nxb strongly affects the results .",
    "according to @xcite , the systematic @xmath34 uncertainty in the 1540  kev nxb is 3.2  % .",
    "we conservatively adopt a systematic uncertainty of @xmath725% ( 90% uncertainty ) , and estimate the upper limit on any extra hard x - ray component . since the uncertainty in the nxb overwhelms the statistical error on the icm temperature , we fix the temperature of the apec model at 9.0  kev and add a power - law component to represent the extra hard x - ray emission .",
    "we fixed the photon index of the power - law at 2.0 , which is the same as that in @xcite .",
    "the 90% upper limit on the hard power - law component is obtained by employing the nxb spectra for which normalization is 5% lower than the normal nxb .",
    "the hxd spectra including @xmath725% variations in the normalization of the nxb are shown in figure  [ fig : hxd ] .",
    "the upper limit on the flux of any extra hard x - ray component is @xmath73 ( 2060  kev ) , which is consistent with the detection obtained with integral ( 0.7@xmath74 ; @xcite ) and the upper limit from a combined swift / bat and chandra spectrum ( @xmath75 ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that the temperature of the apec model is 8.5  kev as @xcite did , the upper limit on the flux is @xmath76 ( 2060  kev ) . on the other hand , if we assume that the icm temperature is 9.7  kev ( region  c ; table  [ tab : spec ] ) , it is @xmath77 .",

    "although @xmath80 is almost equivalent to ionization equilibrium for nei , there is a small difference between nei and apec ( figure  [ fig : ratio ] ) .",

    "in particular , the temperatures of the western and southern regions were reported to be extremely high ( @xmath8120  kev ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our suzaku results indicate that the cluster is almost isothermal ( @xmath3210  kev ) .    one possible cause for the difference would be a problem with the x - ray background for the asca observation .",
    "while @xcite used a background obtained from a source - free region near the cluster ( h  1705250 ) , we constructed a background based on a model of the galactic emission@xmath27 plus a model for the hard cxb .",
    "since the western and southern regions are dim , the difference of the background could affect the results .",
    "however , we found that this is not likely to be the case .",
    "we observed the region around h  1705250 with suzaku with an exposure time of 15  ks .",
    "then , we used the spectrum of this region as the background for a spectral fit of region w. in this case , the temperature is @xmath82  kev , which is consistent with that in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "another possibility is that the high temperature in these faint outer regions is due to stray light from the bright central regions of the cluster . for the x - ray telescopes carried on asca , such problem was much more serious for asca than for suzaku @xcite .",
    "although @xcite took account of the effect in their analysis , the correction might not have been sufficient .",
    "although we could not find the cause of the inconsistency , we believe that the results of suzaku are more reliable , because the problem of the stray light has been much improved .",
    "the existence of a cool core ( section  [ sec : depro ] ) and the isothermality of the cluster ( section  [ sec : spec ] ) indicate that the ophiuchus cluster is a cool core cluster . while many of clusters with medium temperatures ( @xmath83  kev ) are cool core clusters having short central cooling times , most of the hottest clusters with temperatures similar to the ophiuchus ( @xmath84  kev ) do not seem to have cool cores ( e.g. figure  18c , d in @xcite ) .",
    "this is probably because the latter are major - merger clusters in which the core has been destroyed and the temperature has been boosted by the merger @xcite .",
    "for example , the extended hiflugcs sample includes 106 nearby clusters @xcite . among them , there are only 8 clusters , including the ophiuchus cluster , with temperatures larger than 9.0  kev @xcite .",
    "five of them ( a  1689 , a  1914 , a  2163 , a  2319 , and triangulum australis ) do not have a prominent cool core @xcite .",
    "although a  754 and a  2142 have a cool core , they are now undergoing a major merger @xcite .",
    "thus , the ophiuchus cluster seems to be exceptional in having a very high temperature and a cool core with no strong evidence of a major merger .",
    "since clusters with cool cores tend to be old ( e.g. @xcite ) , the ophiuchus cluster would be exceptionally old given its large mass .",
    "contrary to merging clusters in which star formation activities might be induced in the disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the environment in the ophiuchus cluster might have been calm for a long time .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to study the nature of the galaxies inside it .",
    "most of the clusters from which non - thermal x - ray emission has been detected are major - merger clusters @xcite .",
    "since non - thermal synchrotron radio emission has often been observed from these clusters @xcite , the non - thermal hard x - ray emission could be attributed to inverse compton scattering of photons by the relativistic electrons that are responsible for the radio emission . since the cooling time of these electrons (",
    "@xmath85  yr ) is much shorter than the dynamical time - scale of a cluster ( @xmath86  yr ; @xcite ) , the electrons are likely to be primary electrons , which are now being directly accelerated at shocks or turbulence in the icm induced by recent cluster mergers .",
    "the hard x - ray excess detected by @xcite from the ophiuchus cluster is curious in this regard .",
    "although a cluster merger does not always destroy a cool core ( e.g. a  2142 ; @xcite ) and our temperature map ( figure  [ fig : tz]a ) is coarse , the x - ray image and spectra from this cluster do not show any strong evidence for a major merger .",
    "one possibility is that the ophiuchus cluster is currently undergoing an early stage , small impact parameter ( head - on ) merger with the merger axis being close to our line of sight .",
    "then , the two merging subclusters would be projected on top of one another , and no azimuthal temperature variations would necessarily be expected . by the same argument",
    ", one would not necessarily expect any azimuthal variations in the mean redshift .",
    "although the likelihood of a head - on collision along the line of sight is small , this hypothesis would appear to be consistent with the apparent regularity of ophiuchus , the presence of a cool core ( albeit without any very cool gas ) , and the presence of nonthermal hard x - ray emission due to a merger shock or turbulence .    on the other hand ,",
    "if ophiuchus really is not a merging cluster , then the nonthermal hard x - rays can not be attributed to primary electrons accelerated through a recent major cluster merger , although we can not rule out particle - acceleration by turbulence in the core generated by a minor merger @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that particles might have been accelerated by the central agn rather than a cluster merger , because the hard x - ray emission is observed at the center of the ophiuchus cluster @xcite .",
    "moreover , since recent strong agn activities have not been observed at the cluster center @xcite , the non - thermal emission from the cluster may come from secondary electrons that are generated through proton - proton interaction @xcite . in this case , the non - thermal emission can be observed even long after the agn activities and proton acceleration cease , because the cooling time of the protons is longer than the age of a cluster .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the protons are accelerated at the forward shock around a cocoon created by an agn outburst .",
    "another possible source of the non - thermal x - ray emission would be dark matter annihilation ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . in any case",
    ", a confirmation of the non - thermal emission in ophiuchus with other instruments would also be very useful .",
    "the swift / bat instrument observed ophiuchus for 1.3 msec , and failed to detect any non - thermal hard x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "based on a joint chandra and swift / bat analysis ( with chandra used to constrain the thermal emission from the cluster ) , @xcite found an upper limit of @xmath87 ( 2060 kev ) , which is inconsistent with the integral detection at more than 2@xmath88 .",
    "we note that @xcite fit the thermal emission from the cluster with with a single temperature model with a temperature of 8.5  kev .",
    "we find that most of the cluster is hotter than this , in agreement with the results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the difference with @xcite may be due to the cool core in ophiuchus .",
    "it is possible that a more complex thermal model may be needed for ophiuchus , and might bring the integral and swift / bat results into better agreement . given the present disagreement of the integral and swift / bat spectral results , the lack of evidence for a merger , and the lack of a modern radio detection of a halo or relic , we view the non - thermal detection in ophiuchus as tentative .",
    "we observed the ophiuchus cluster with suzaku x - ray satellite .",
    "we found that the icm of the cluster is hot ( @xmath3210  kev ) and is almost isothermal except for the core .",
    "contrary to a previous study , we did not find extremely hot regions ( @xmath89  kev ) in the cluster . in the core ,",
    "the temperature is smaller and the metal abundance is larger than those in the surrounding region .",
    "the radial velocity difference between different regions of the icm is less than @xmath90 .",
    "the iron line ratios in x - ray spectra suggest that the icm has reached a ionization equilibrium .",
    "these features indicate that the ophiuchus cluster is not a major - merger cluster but is a so - called cool core cluster .",
    "this cluster would be an exceptional cluster because most of the clusters with these temperatures ( @xmath84  kev ) are major - merger clusters .",
    "another possibility is that ophiuchus is a nearly head - on merger with the merger axis nearly along our line of sight ; such a model would be consistent with the observed properties of the cluster .",
    "we obtained the upper limit of hard x - ray excess , which is consistent with the recent detection with integral and upper limit with swift / bat . assuming that the ophiuchus cluster is not a major - merger cluster , the origin of any hard x - ray excess may not be a recent major cluster merger .",
