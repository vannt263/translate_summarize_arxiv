    "recently[1 ] we argued that an unique property of high - t@xmath5 cuprates is related with a dual nature of the mott insulating state of the parent compounds that manifests itself in two distinct energy scales for the charge transfer ( ct ) reaction : cu@xmath6+cu@xmath6@xmath7cu@xmath8+cu@xmath9 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath10-@xmath10 ct gap as derived from the optical measurements in parent cuprates such as la@xmath2cuo@xmath11 is 1.5 - 2.0ev while the true ( thermal ) @xmath10-@xmath10 ct gap , or effective correlation parameter @xmath12 , appears to be as small as 0.4 - 0.5ev .",
    "it means cuprates should be addressed to be _ d - d _ ct unstable systems whose description implies accounting of the three many - electron valence states cuo@xmath0 ( cu@xmath1 ) on an equal footing as a well - defined charge triplet .    below",
    "we introduce a minimal model with the on site hilbert space reduced to only three states , three effective valence centers cuo@xmath0 ( nominally cu@xmath1 ) where the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom get strongly locked together , and make use of the s=1 pseudospin formalism we have proposed earlier[1 - 4 ] .",
    "such a formalism constitutes a powerful method to study complex phenomena in interacting quantum systems characterized by the coexistence and competition of various ordered states[5 ] .",
    "in frames of the pseudospin formalism we address a mixed - valence ( mv ) system with three possible stable on - site valence states @xmath13 , hereafter a bare center @xmath14=cuo@xmath15 , a hole center @xmath16=cuo@xmath17 , and an electron center @xmath18=cuo@xmath19 , respectively , and neglect all other degrees of freedom focusing on the quantum charges .",
    "three different valence charge states @xmath20 we associate with three components of the @xmath21 pseudo - spin ( isospin ) triplet with @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "such a correspondence immediately implies introduction of the unconventional on - site mv quantum superpositions @xmath23 , or @xmath24 that points to many novel effects related with local cu states .",
    "however , we should note that at variance with spinless ground states of cu@xmath8 and cu@xmath9 centers the bare cu@xmath6 center has a conventional spin s=1/2 , in other words we arrive at the s=1 pseudospin model with doubly degenerate m=0 value . in the partition function of the classical spin model ,",
    "this leads to a factor of 2 for every cu@xmath6 site .",
    "the @xmath21 spin algebra includes eight independent nontrivial pseudo - spin operators , three dipole and five quadrupole operators : @xmath25 the two fermion - like pseudospin raising / lowering operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 change the pseudo - spin projection by @xmath28 , with slightly different properties @xmath29 @xmath30 in lieu of @xmath31 and @xmath32 operators one may use two novel operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 which do realize transformations cu@xmath6@xmath36cu@xmath9 and cu@xmath8@xmath36cu@xmath6 , respectively . the boson - like pseudospin raising / lowering operators @xmath37 do change the pseudo - spin projection by @xmath38 and define a local nematic order parameter @xmath39 .",
    "this on - site off - diagonal order parameter is nonzero only for the on - site @xmath40(cu@xmath8)-@xmath41(cu@xmath9 ) superpositions .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) operator creates an on - site hole ( electron ) pair , or composite boson , with a kinematic constraint @xmath44=0 , that underlines its `` hard - core '' nature .",
    "obviously , the pseudospin nematic average @xmath45 can be addressed to be a local complex superconducting order parameter .",
    "both @xmath46(@xmath47 ) and @xmath48(@xmath49 ) can be anyhow related with a conventional s=1/2 spin single particle creation ( annihilation ) operators , however , these are not standard fermionic ones , as well as @xmath50(@xmath51 ) operators are not standard bosonic ones .",
    "effective s=1 pseudospin hamiltonian which does commute with the z - component of the total pseudospin @xmath52 thus conserving the total charge of the system can be written to be a sum of potential and kinetic energies : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 being a sum of one - particle and two - particle transfer contributions . in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath32 operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 read as follows : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 with a charge density constraint : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the deviation from a half - filling ( @xmath63=@xmath64 ) .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath65 corresponds to a classical spin-1 ising model with a single - ion anisotropy in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "the first single - site term describes the effects of a bare pseudo - spin splitting , or the local energy of @xmath66 centers and relates with the on - site density - density interactions .",
    "the second term may be related to a pseudo - magnetic field @xmath67@xmath68@xmath69 , in particular , a real electric field which acts as a chemical potential ( @xmath70 is the hole chemical potential , and @xmath71 is a ( random ) site energy ) .",
    "the third term in @xmath65 describes the effects of the short- and long - range inter - site density - density interactions including screened coulomb and covalent couplings .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath56 describes the one - particle inter - site hopping and represents an obvious extension of the conventional hubbard model which assumes that the electronic orbital is infinitely rigid irrespective of occupation number , and has much in common with so - called dynamic hubbard models[6 ] that describe a correlated hopping .",
    "indeed , conventional hubbard model implies all the single particle transfer ( [ h - st ] ) is governed only by the @xmath72-term in ( [ h - st ] ) while the @xmath73 and @xmath74 terms describe a non - hubbard correlated density - dependent single - particle hopping . in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 operators",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath56 transforms as follows : @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 all the three terms in ( [ h1a ] ) suppose a clear physical interpretation .",
    "the first @xmath78-type term describes one - particle hopping processes : @xmath79 , that is a rather conventional motion of the hole @xmath41 ( @xmath80 ) centers in the lattice formed by @xmath14 ( @xmath81)-centers ( @xmath3-type carriers , respectively ) or the motion of the @xmath14 ( @xmath81)-centers in the lattice formed by hole @xmath41 ( @xmath80 ) centers ( @xmath4-type carriers , respectively ) .",
    "the second @xmath82-type term describes one - particle hopping processes : @xmath83 , that is a rather conventional motion of the electron @xmath40 ( @xmath84 ) centers in the lattice formed by @xmath14 ( @xmath81)-centers ( @xmath4-type carriers ) or the motion of the @xmath14 ( @xmath81)-centers in the lattice formed by electron @xmath40 ( @xmath84 ) centers ( @xmath3-type carriers ) .",
    "these hopping processes are typical ones for heavily underdoped or heavily overdoped cuprates .",
    "it is worth noting that the st - type contribution of the one - particle transfer differs in sign for the @xmath78 and @xmath82 transfer thus breaking the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the third @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) term in ( [ h1a ] ) defines a very different one - particle hopping process : @xmath87 , that is the _ local disproportionation / recombination _ , or the _",
    "@xmath88-pair creation / annihilation_. interestingly , the term can be related with a local pairing as the @xmath84 center can be addressed to be electron pair (= composite electron boson ) localized on the @xmath80 center or _ vice versa _ the @xmath80 center can be addressed to be hole pair (= composite hole boson ) localized on the @xmath84 center .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath57 describes the two - particle ( local composite boson ) inter - site hopping , that is the motion of the electron ( hole ) center in the lattice formed by the hole ( electron ) centers , or the exchange reaction : @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , @xmath90 is the transfer integral for the local composite boson .    conventional spin degree of freedom can be build in our effective hamiltonian , if we take into account heisenberg spin exchange cu@xmath6-cu@xmath6 coupling as follows @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a projection operator which picks out the s=1/2 cu@xmath6 center , @xmath93 is an exchange integral .",
    "obviously , the spin exchange provides an energy gain to the parent antiferromagnetic insulating ( afmi ) phase with @xmath94=0 , while local superconducting order parameter is maximal given @xmath94=1 .",
    "in other words , the superconductivity and magnetism are nonsymbiotic phenomena with competing order parameters giving rise to an inter - twinning , glassiness , and other forms of electronic heterogeneities .",
    "effective pseudospin hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is significantly complicated as compared with a typical s=1 spin hamiltonian with uniaxial single - ion and exchange anisotropies on a square lattice : @xmath95 investigated rather extensively in recent years ( see , e.g. , refs.[7 ] and references therein ) .",
    "correspondence with our pseudospin hamiltonian points to @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( @xmath99=0 ; @xmath100=0 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hs ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath101 and a shift of the brillouin zone @xmath102 .",
    "the spectrum of the spin hamiltonian ( [ hs ] ) in the absence of external magnetic field changes drastically as @xmath103 varies from very small to very large positive or negative values .",
    "a strong `` easy - plane '' anisotropy for large positive @xmath104 favors a singlet phase where all the spins are in the @xmath105 ground state .",
    "this quadrupole ( @xmath106=-@xmath107 ) phase has no magnetic order , and is aptly referred to as a quantum paramagnetic phase ( qpm ) , which is separated from the `` ordered '' state by a quantum critical point ( qcp ) at some @xmath103=@xmath108 .",
    "a strong `` easy - axis '' anisotropy for large negative @xmath109 , favors a spin ordering along @xmath69 , the `` easy axis '' , with the on - site @xmath110 ( @xmath69-phase ) .",
    "the order parameter will be `` ising - like '' and long - range ( staggered ) diagonal order will persist at finite temperature , up to a critical line t@xmath111 . for intermediate values",
    "@xmath112 the hamiltonian will have o(2 ) symmetry and the system is in a gapless @xmath113 phase . at t=0 the o(2 )",
    "symmetry will be spontaneously broken and the system will exhibit spin order in some direction . although there will be no ordered phase at finite temperature one expects a finite temperature kosterlitz - thouless transition . at finite effective field",
    "@xmath114 but @xmath115=1 the @xmath113 phase transforms into a canted antiferromagnetic @xmath113-@xmath116 phase , the spins acquire a uniform longitudinal component which increases with field and saturates at the fully polarized ( fp ) state ( all @xmath117=1 , @xmath116 phase ) above the saturation field @xmath118",
    ". however , at @xmath1190 and @xmath1201 the phase diagram contains an extended spin supersolid or biconical phase @xmath113-@xmath121 with ferrimagnetic @xmath122-order that does exist over a range of magnetic fields[7 ] .",
    "the pseudospin hamiltonian , eq.([h ] ) differs from its simplified version ( [ hs ] ) in several points .",
    "this concerns the charge density constraint ( [ sz ] ) , a significantly more complicated form of the `` transversal '' ( @xmath113 ) term , existence of the conventional spin s=1/2 for @xmath123 pseudospin states . the pseudospin parameters , in particular @xmath103 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 in the effective hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be closely linked to each other . at variance with typical spin systems the pseudospin system appears to be strongly anisotropic one with an enhanced role of frustrative effects of in - plane next - nearest neighbor couplings , inter - plane coupling , and different non - heisenberg biquadratic interactions .",
    "despite the difference we can translate many results of the spin s=1 algebra to our pseudospin system . turning to a classification of the possible homogeneous phases of the charge states of the model cuprates and its phase diagram",
    "we introduce @xmath126 ( cu@xmath8 , cu@xmath6 , cu@xmath9 ) , @xmath127 mv-2 ( cu@xmath128 , cu@xmath129 , cu@xmath130 ) , and @xmath131 mv-3 ( cu@xmath1 ) phases in accordance with character of the on - site superpositions ( [ site ] ) .",
    "then , in accordance with the above nomenclature of spin phases and the charge triplet  s=1 pseudospin correspondence we arrive at a parent monovalent ( cu@xmath6 ) phase as an analogue of the qpm phase , the @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath113-@xmath134 , @xmath113-@xmath135 , @xmath113-@xmath136 , @xmath113-@xmath137 , @xmath113-@xmath138 , @xmath113-@xmath139 , @xmath113-@xmath140 , @xmath113-@xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 phases as mono- , bi- , and trivalent analogues of respective spin phases . all the metallic phases with @xmath132 and @xmath133 components",
    "do admit in principle the pseudospin nematic order @xmath1440 related with the high - t@xmath5 superconductivity ( htsc ) . in all the trivalent phases the superconducting order competes with a spin ordering .",
    "moreover , in @xmath113-@xmath141 phase we deal with a competition of superconducting , spin , and charge orders .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath113-@xmath69 nomenclature does strictly reflect an interplay of kinetic ( @xmath113-terms ) and potential ( @xmath69-term ) energies , or itineracy and localization .    for the undoped model cuprate with @xmath145=0 ( half filling ) given rather large positive @xmath146 we arrive at insulating monovalent _ quantum paramagnetic _ @xmath14 ( cu@xmath6)-phase , a typical one for mott - hubbard insulators . in parent cuprates , such as la@xmath2cuo@xmath11",
    ", the cu@xmath6 ions form an antiferromagnetically ( af ) coupled square lattice of s = 1/2 spins , which could possibly realize the resonant valence bond ( rvb ) liquid of singlet spin pairs . in the rvb state",
    "the large energy gain of the singlet pair state , resonating between the many spatial pairing configurations , drives strong quantum fluctuations strong enough to suppress long range af order .",
    "however , by lowering the @xmath103 below @xmath147 the undoped cuprate can be turned first into metallic and superconducting @xmath133 phase , and given @xmath148 into a fully disproportionated mv-2 system of electron @xmath40 and hole @xmath41 centers ( @xmath149-phase ) with @xmath150=1 , or _ electron - hole bose liquid _ ( ehbl)[1 - 4,8 ] .",
    "there is no single particle transport : @xmath151=0 , while the bosonic one may exist , and , in common , @xmath1520 .",
    "given the @xmath153 condition the ehbl phase is equivalent to the lattice hard - core ( hc ) bose system with an inter - site repulsion . indeed",
    ", one may address the electron @xmath40 center to be a system of a local composite boson ( @xmath154 ) localized on the hole @xmath41 center : @xmath155 .",
    "for such a system , the pseudo - spin hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be mapped onto the hamiltonian of hc bose gas on a lattice ( see refs.[9,10 ] and references therein ) @xmath156 where @xmath157 , @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) are the pauli creation ( annihilation ) operators which are bose - like commuting for different sites , but @xmath160 , @xmath161=1 - 2n_i$ ] .",
    "the ehbl model exhibits many fascinating quantum phases and phase transitions .",
    "early investigations[9 ] point to the @xmath162 charge order ( co=@xmath138 ) , bose superfluid ( bs=@xmath113-@xmath134 ) and mixed ( bs+co=@xmath113-@xmath140 ) supersolid uniform phases with an ising - type melting transition ( co - no=@xmath138-@xmath134 ) and kosterlitz - thouless - type ( bs - no=@xmath113-@xmath134-@xmath134 ) phase transitions to a non - ordered normal fluid ( no=@xmath134 ) in 2d systems . at half - filling ( @xmath163 )",
    "given @xmath164 , @xmath165=0 the ehbl system obviously prefers a superconducting bs=@xmath132 phase while at @xmath166 , @xmath165=0 it prefers an insulating checkerboard charge order co=@xmath138 .",
    "it is worth noting that the qmc calculations[11 ] show that under doping away from half filling , the checkerboard solid undergoes phase separation : the superfluid ( bs ) and solid ( co ) phases coexist but not as a single thermodynamic bs+co phase .",
    "the ehbl model truly reproduces many important aspects of the cuprate physics[1 ] , in particular , the pseudogap phenomenon as a result of the eh coupling . at the same time",
    "it can not explain a number of well - known properties , in particular , manifestation of the cu@xmath6 valence states in doped cuprates over wide doping range[12 ] and suppression of the superconductivity for overdoped cuprates .",
    "such a behaviour can not be derived from the ehbl scenario and points to realization of the more complicated `` boson - fermion '' dual xy - z@xmath167 phase with coexisting spin and pseudospin ( charge ) orders in a wide doping range from parent to overdoped compounds including all the superconducting phase .",
    "the suppression of the superconductivity for the hole overdoped cuprates can be explained as a transition from the trivalent superconducting ( m@xmath168 ) phase to a bivalent nonsuperconducting m@xmath169 phase .",
    "indeed , the m@xmath170=cu@xmath8 centers could be energetically gainless under hole doping particularly for overscreened eh coupling .",
    "some properties of nonsuperconducting phases m@xmath169 and m@xmath171 , or @xmath113-@xmath135 and @xmath113-@xmath136 , can be understood if we address limiting insulating phases @xmath16 or @xmath18",
    "( @xmath172 or @xmath173 ) with precisely @xmath16 or @xmath18-centers on each of the lattice sites . in frames of the pseudospin formalism",
    "these phases correspond to fully polarized ferromagnetic states with @xmath174=@xmath175n , where n is the number of cu sites .",
    "interestingly , in frames of the pseudospin formalism the `` heavily overdoped '' @xmath113-@xmath135 and @xmath113-@xmath136 phases with @xmath1761 can be represented as ferromagnets where the charge constraint is realized through the occurrence of ( 1-x)n non - interacting pseudospin magnons ( @xmath177=@xmath1751 ) , that is cu@xmath6 centers , obeying fermi statistics due to s=1/2 conventional spin .",
    "these heavily overdoped cuprates could be addressed to be conventional fermi liquids with a large fermi surface .",
