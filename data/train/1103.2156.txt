    "fu orionis - type objects ( hereafter , fuors ) are a class of low - mass pre - main sequence objects named after the prototype fu orionis , which produced a 5 magnitude optical outburst in 1936 and has remained in its brightened state ever since .",
    "about five more sources have been observed to flare prior to 2010 ; similar spectral characteristics ( broad blueshifted emission lines , ir excess , near - ir co overtone absorption ) have been used to identify @xmath3 10 additional fuor - like objects @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that fuors are the result of a sudden cataclysmic accretion of material from a reservoir that had built up in the circumstellar disk surrounding a young stellar object .",
    "models of fuor outbursts indicate that over only a few months the accretion rate rises from the typical rate for a t tauri star ( @xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 ) up to 10@xmath9m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 , and then decays over an e - fold time of @xmath3 10 - 100 yr @xcite . over the entire outburst",
    "the star could accrete @xmath3 0.01 m@xmath7 of material , roughly the mass of a typical t tauri disk @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared observations of fuors with the spitzer space telescope reveal that some resemble embedded protostars , in which their excess emission at wavelengths greater than @xmath3 30 @xmath1 m can not be accounted for by circumstellar disk models alone , while others lack a strong mid - ir excess above that of a mildly flared disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fuors are connected with both t tauri stars and more embedded systems , repeating outburst cycles with replenished material from an infalling envelope @xcite .",
    "until now we have not had the opportunity to study the far - infrared emission from an fuor close to maximum light , within a few months of outburst .",
    "hbc 722 , also known as lkh@xmath10 188-g4 and ptf10qpf , is located in the `` gulf of mexico '' in the southern region of the north american / pelican nebula ( 520 pc distance ; * ? ? ?",

    "hbc 722 ( 20h58m17.0s + 43d53m42.9s j2000 ) was identified independently as an fuor by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "prior to outburst it was identified as an emission - line object of spectral type k7-m0 by @xcite , who estimated an interstellar reddening of a@xmath11 @xmath0 3.4 mag .",
    "the rise in luminosity began slowly , but accelerated during the summer of 2010 @xcite and was monitored in the optical and near - ir @xcite , exhibiting two separate epochs of behavior : during the june - early august 2010 period it rose @xmath3 1 mag ( beginning at 16.5 mag in r - band in 2009 ) ; then it increased 3 mag in the next 50 days , before reaching peak flux in late september 2010 .",
    "it has since declined by 0.5 mag at optical wavelengths ; this decline rate would suggest a return to quiescence within 1 yr @xcite , considerably faster than a classical fuor ; however from aavso photometry it appears that the rate of decay has since slowed .",
    "no fuor has been as well - characterized prior to outburst as hbc 722 .",
    "hbc 722 was observed with herschel as a target of opportunity ( pi : j. green ) during regular science phase @xcite .",
    "the 50@xmath2@xmath1250@xmath2 region around hbc 722 was observed with all three spectroscopic instruments on herschel ( pacs , spire , and hifi ) , and with the 230 ghz heterodyne receiver and sharc - ii @xcite on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) . all of these observations were obtained between nov .",
    "30 and dec .",
    "14 , 2010 , and the herschel observations are planned to be repeated six months later .",
    "k - band , spitzer - irac 8 @xmath1 m , spitzer - mips 24 @xmath1 m pre - ouburst , pacs , spire , and sharc - ii post - outburst images of hbc 722 and its surroundings are shown in figure [ hbc722_spirephot ] .",
    "the k@xmath13-band image was obtained as part of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) , taken with the wide field camera on the 3.8 m diameter ukirt in 2006 , as part of data release 8 .",
    "the spitzer data were obtained as part of programs 20015 and 462 ( p.i .",
    ": l. rebull ) .",
    "pacs photometry was gathered in single - cycle integration times in the small scan map mode at orientation angles of 70@xmath14 and 110@xmath14 .",
    "the beam sizes at 70 , 100 , and 160 @xmath1 m are approximately 5.5@xmath2 , 6.5@xmath2 , and 11@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "spire photometry was gathered in single - cycle integration times in the small map mode .",

    "the on - orbit beam sizes are 18.1@xmath2 , 25.2@xmath2 , and 36.6@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the herschel data were reduced using hipe ( herschel interactive processing environment ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) pipeline v6.0 .",
    "the sharc - ii bolometer array @xcite has a 2.9@xmath120.7@xmath15 field of view and a beamsize of 8.5@xmath2 at 350 @xmath1 m , and @xmath16 was stable at @xmath3 0.03 .",
    "hifi @xcite was used in single point mode , in band 6b ( 1578.21697.8 ghz ) tuned to co j@xmath014 - 13 ( 1611.8 ghz ) , and in band 1b ( 562.6628.4 ghz ) for co j@xmath05 - 4 ( 576.3 ghz ) .",
    "the data were again reduced using hipe .",
    "the beam size of hifi is 43.1@xmath2 in band 1b , and @xmath3 15@xmath2 in band 6b ; thus the low - j lines contain far more emission from the submillimeter source , while the high - j lines are less confused .",
    "spire - fts @xcite was utilized as a single pointing with sparse image sampling , high spectral resolution , in 1 hr of integration time .",
    "the spectrum is divided into two orders covering the spectral ranges 194  325 @xmath1 m ( ssw ) and 320  690 @xmath1 m ( slw ) , with a resolution of @xmath17/@xmath18 @xmath3 300800 , increasing at shorter wavelengths .",
    "each order is reduced separately within hipe using the standard pipeline for extended sources , including apodization to remove the airy diffraction pattern .",
    "none of the lines in the hbc 722 vicinity detected with spire are spectrally or spatially resolved , and thus include components from all sources in the region .",
    "the measured rms of the spectra range from 0.2 jy to 0.6 jy , as expected from the herschel time estimator .",
    "we recover the same total co j@xmath0 5 - 4 flux measured with hifi .",
    "additionally , most lines appear blueshifted by @xmath3 200 km s@xmath8 , likely an artifact of the pipeline reduction for spire - fts ; the velocity - resolved hifi data do not show this effect , nor do the pacs data .",
    "pacs @xcite is a 5@xmath125 array of 9.4@xmath2 @xmath129.4@xmath2 spatial pixels ( also referred to as `` spaxels '' ) covering the spectral range from 51  210 @xmath1 m with a resolution @xmath17/@xmath18 @xmath3 10003000 , divided into four orders , covering @xmath3 5075 , 70105 , 100145 , and 140210 @xmath1 m .",
    "we reached expected rms sensitivity of @xmath3 a few @xmath12 0.1 jy ( continuum ) or @xmath3 3 - 10 @xmath12 10@xmath19 w m@xmath20 .",
    "each order was first reduced using a modified pipeline based on the standard pacs spectral reduction script within hipe . the relative spectral response function within each band",
    "was determined both before launch and modified using calibration data taken in the early phases of the mission .",
    "further improvements in the flatfielding , spectral response , and defringing are underway and will further improve the spectral shape ; however line fluxes are not likely to be affected strongly except for a reduction in the rms uncertainty .",
    "the telescope sky background was subtracted using two nod positions 6  from the source .",
    "the absolute flux uncertainty is estimated at 20% .",
    "from the photometry it is clear that the position corresponding to the outbursting source does not emit strongly in continuum at wavelengths greater than 70 @xmath1 m , consistent with the low extinction and disk - like spectrum measured pre - outburst . at 70 @xmath1 m",
    "we detect a point - source with f@xmath21 0.412 @xmath22 0.020 jy , but this value should be considered an upper limit as it includes co - spatial cloud emission . like many other fuors , the flaring source has an offset submillimeter counterpart @xcite . in order to isolate the gas component due to hbc 722 , which is only possible in the pacs and cso data due to spatial resolution , we extracted the central spaxel separately , which encompasses a 10@xmath2 square covering hbc 722 itself . the j@xmath014 - 13 to j@xmath021 - 20 co emission from the spaxel that includes hbc 722 is fit with high uncertainty by a single temperature ( 289 k @xmath22 212 k ) .",
    "if the co temperature toward hbc 722 is raised by the outburst , this effect may increase during the second epoch of observations six months later .",
    "figure [ csomap ] shows the distribution of co j@xmath0 2 - 1 , in blue and redshifted contours , showing a clear bipolar structure projected on or behind hbc 722 as well as several additional outflows ; the spatial resolution ( 32@xmath2 ) is insufficient to identify the driving source , but hbc 722 clearly sits in an active star forming region .",
    "the fwhm of the j@xmath0 5 - 4 line observed with hifi is @xmath3 0.04 ghz , or 7.45 km s@xmath8 , centered at 1611.7582 ghz , consistent with the co j@xmath0 2 - 1 spectra .",
    "the profile of this line is almost exactly matched to the j@xmath0 2 - 1 line  barring the stronger absorption in the j@xmath0 5 - 4 profile , indicating a similar emitting source ; however it is quite strong compared even to most embedded protostars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; furthermore the spire - fts measurement of the j@xmath0 5 - 4 line matches the velocity - integrated hifi flux .",
    "this further indicates that the spire spectrum is dominated by a stronger submillimeter source , while the pacs central spaxel is characterizing hbc 722 itself .",
    "it is also possible that _ all _ of the co emission at this location may be due to outflows unrelated to hbc 722 .",
    "the sharc 350 @xmath1 m image resolves the spire photometry at the same wavelength range into multiple sources , clearly delineating the dominant submm source .",
    "the submillimeter peak is strong but offset from the location of the fuor by @xmath3 16@xmath2 , instead aligning with a different and much redder source , identified with the 2mass source 20581767 + 4353310 ( also identified as jcmtsf j205817.0 + 435327 , or 205817.66 + 435331.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this situation is similar to the rno 1b / c region that harbors two fuor - like objects and more deeply embedded sources nearby @xcite .",
    "this second source appears as a minor but clearly separate source between 1.25 and 8 @xmath1 m , but dominates the flux at wavelengths @xmath23 24 @xmath1 m @xcite as well as the pacs and spire photometric bands , and the sharc 350 @xmath1 m image .",
    "we extracted 2@xmath122 spaxel areas centered on the best - known location of 2mass 20581767 + 4353310 .",
    "the submm source is off - center to the south by 2 spaxels , or 16@xmath2 , another source of absolute flux uncertainty .",
    "the spire - fts spectrum of the region is rich in gas lines , including co j@xmath05 - 4 up to j@xmath013 - 12 ,",
    "[ c i ] at 370.4 @xmath1 m ( blended with the co j@xmath0 7 - 6 line ) , and [ n ii ] at 205 @xmath1 m , a likely outflow indicator seen in other fuors @xcite . in the pacs spectrum",
    "we can clearly see that the continuum emission and much of the line emission is focused near the position of the submillimeter source , 2mass 20581767 + 4353310 , and not hbc 722 .",
    "we detected a wealth of high - j co emission up to j@xmath0 21 - 20 , [ o i ] , but no indication of [ n ii ] , [ n iii ] , or [ o iii ] ; in fact , [ o iii ] 88.3 @xmath1 m and [ n iii ] 57.3 @xmath1 m , and [ c ii ] 157 @xmath1 m appear in absorption due to the superposition of an hii region in the off - positions . the combined pacs - spire spectrum of 2mass 20581767 + 4353310 is displayed in figure [ hbc722_spirespec ] , with the spire spectrum scaled downward by a factor of 1.5 to match , and the detected lines are listed in table [ hbc722_spirelines ] .",
    "the source has brightened in the past decade ; the ukirt ( observed in 2006 ) jhk magnitudes are @xmath3 0.2 mag higher than the 2mass ( observed in 2000 ) values ( the photometric uncertainties are @xmath3 0.036 - 0.054 mag for 2mass , and @xmath3 0.07 - 0.09 for ukirt ) .",
    "a secondary source visible to the west in the sharc image that appears at wavelengths beyond 250 @xmath1 m may be contributing as well , and although it has no 2mass counterpart it is visible in the ukirt image , separated from 2mass 20581767 + 4353310 by an extinguished region .",
    "the region around 2mass 20581767 + 4353310 shows a rich gas spectrum indicative of heated ambient material .",
    "a single temperature fit to the full co rotational diagram does not characterize the data very well ; a break in the data points occurs around e@xmath24/k@xmath0 600 k. the lower energy points yield a temperature of 100 @xmath22 22 k , while the higher energy points indicate 246 @xmath22 94 k ( figure [ corotdiagram ] ) .",
    "optical depth effects would lead to an underestimate of the population in lower j levels , causing a deviation below the fit at low energy .",
    "we see no obvious sign of this effect .",
    "although the rotational diagram is uncertain due to source confusion at the spatial resolution of herschel and the combined use of spire and pacs , some of these problems are mitigated : the choice of breakpoint is close to the boundary between the instruments but the results do not change significantly if the break is adjusted slightly in either direction ; the extracted region in pacs and spire is similar in spatial extent ; lastly , we are more likely to underestimate the flux from the extended outflow ( figure [ csomap ] ) at the shortest wavelengths where the beam is smallest , causing a drop in the high energy state populations",
    ". we do not observe this effect ; if it is significant , the evidence for the higher temperature component becomes stronger .",

    "measured from only the herschel spectrum and photometry centered on this source l@xmath30 5.4 @xmath22 1.8 @xmath31 and t@xmath30 33.4 @xmath22 11.0 k ; clearly it and the other western source dominate the submillimeter emission while contributing little to the optical / near - ir portion of the spectrum relative to hbc 722 itself .      given the recent nature of the outburst , it is possible that any shocks from hbc 722 have not yet had time to propagate into a large enough area to be observed . a hot disk of radius 0.5 au would have a very small beam filling factor of 3.3 @xmath12 10@xmath32 in band 6b .",
    "if instead the emission is driven by a newly launched jet , moving at 200 km s@xmath8 , the ejecta could have traveled @xmath3 10 au in the three months between outburst and our herschel observations ; even if the outflow is spherically symmetric , the filling factor is capped at 1.3 @xmath12 10@xmath33 .",
    "most likely the observed co originates in the older outflow traced in the submillimeter line maps , which is extended at least 50@xmath2 , and therefore is not associated with the present outburst .",
    "however , uv photons emitted during the outburst will have traveled @xmath3 15@xmath2 in this time ; therefore if hbc 722 is within this distance of the outflow cavity walls , we may expect that the co flux will increase in our second observation as the uv photons will have traveled @xmath3 four times the distance , encompassing an area 16 times greater and exciting high - j co lines .",
    "the 100 k co traces pdr emission ( presumably from jets ) from the cold gas around embedded sources , as well as outflows in the region .",
    "we might attribute [ n ii ] ( 205 @xmath1 m ) emission to a dissociative shock from a newly launched jet , but it may also be tracing the older outflow ; however the absence of [ n ii ] ( 122 @xmath1 m ) as well as more highly ionized lines ( [ n iii ] and [ o iii ] ) suggest that any jet emission is not contributing significantly .",
    "if during the second epoch the jet has excited the expanded area , highly ionized emission may become detectable . at this time",
    "we see little evidence for shocks but due to the recent nature of the outburst it is possible that the filling factor of any newly launched jet material has not yet risen sufficiently to detect their signature .",
    "two complementary herschel open time programs to observe older fuors ( pis : j. green ; m. audard ) will provide a comparison with sources that have decayed from their respective peaks for decades .",
    "we present the full suite of herschel observations of hbc 722 and the surrounding region .",
    "hbc 722 does not show evidence for a circumstellar envelope or shocked gas , and appears to have erupted from a disklike state , similar to fu orionis itself .",
    "the far - ir / submm emission in this region is dominated by nearby sources such as 2mass 20581767 + 4353310 , rather than the counterpart to the visible / near - ir fuor . in later epochs",
    "the effect of the hbc 722 outburst may become clear through increased heating of co , or emission from shocked gas .",
    "we will re - observe the region with herschel in may 2011 .",
