    "after gravity s geometrization by einstein in @xmath3 several models raised to solve unification related problems using gauge theory by the introduction of compact extra dimension , as proposed by kaluza and klein ( kk ) @xcite . in these models the extra dimensions",
    "are considered compact as a way to recover the four dimension world .",
    "depending on the compactification and the number of dimensions different kinds of fields in the lower dimensional theory can be obtained @xcite .",
    "for example , one can start with the gravity field in five dimensions @xmath4 , were capital latin indexes running from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . in four dimensions , upon dimensional reduction",
    "we get a gravity ( @xmath7 ) , a vector ( @xmath8 ) and a scalar field ( @xmath9 ) , with greek indexes running from @xmath5 to @xmath10 . similarly for the gauge the spectrum in four dimensions has a vector and a scalar field @xmath11 . when considering @xmath0form fields the dimensional reduction provides , @xmath12 , i.e. , a four dimensional @xmath13-form and a four dimensional @xmath14-form .",
    "therefore , the four dimensional vector field can be obtained from a five dimensional @xmath5-form or from a five dimensional @xmath15-form .",
    "in fact these models provide us a plethora of massive modes for all above - mentioned cases , the zero mode being just a particular one .",
    "the need of a compact dimension is due to the fact that in this way the `` escaping '' of the fields to the extra dimensions becomes a small correction .    from a different point of view , a scenario considering our world as a shell has been proposed in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "probably based in @xcite lisa randall and raman sundrum ( rs ) proposed another scenario with four dimensional branes in a five dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space . in this scenario",
    "two different models has been considered : in the rs type i a compact space with two branes and a @xmath16 symmetry is used , solving the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "being a model with compact dimension the dimensional reduction works in a very similar way to the kk model ; in the rs type ii model just one brane embedded in a large extra dimension space is considered .",
    "the extra dimension is curved by a warp factor such that the model has been considered as an alternative to compactification @xcite . as a model for large extra dimensions",
    "the issue of zero mode localization of fields is important .",
    "in fact in the last ten years the zero mode localization of gauge field has becomes a drawback in these model .",
    "this localization is necessary since in a four dimension space fields propagating into the bulk can not be observed .",
    "moreover , it has been found that the zero mode of gravity and scalar fields are localized @xcite in a positive tension brane .",
    "however , due to its conformal invariance the vector field is not localized , which is a serious problem for a realistic model .",
    "this problem has been studied in many ways .",
    "for example , some authors introduced a dilaton coupling to solve the problem @xcite , and others like in @xcite proposed that a strongly coupled gauge theory in five dimensions can generate a massless photon in the brane .",
    "moreover , studies using a topological mass term in the bulk has been introduced .",
    "but they were not able to generate a massless photon in the brane @xcite .",
    "most of these models introduces other fields or nonlinearities to the gauge field @xcite . as a solution for this ,",
    "geometrical couplings has been proposed recently , as can be seen in refs .",
    "@xcite .    as a way to circumvent the lack of localization , the authors in @xcite introduced a mass term in five dimensions and a coupling with the brane .",
    "this gives a localized massless photon with an action given by @xmath17 where @xmath18}$ ] . in this model",
    "the localization is obtained only for some values of the parameter @xmath19 and for a range in @xmath20 . on the other hand , beyond the gauge field ( one form )",
    "other forms can be considered . in @xmath21dimensions",
    "one can in fact have the existence of any @xmath22 .",
    "however , they can be considered in a unified way .",
    "the analysis of localizability of form fields has been considered in @xcite where in @xmath21dimensions only the forms with @xmath23 can be localized .",
    "this is a known result where in the absence of a topological obstruction the field strength of a @xmath0form is dual to the @xmath24form @xcite . using this the authors in @xcite found that in fact also for @xmath25 the field can be localized .",
    "it is important to point that in the models mentioned here the hodge duality is not valid since quadratic terms breaks this duality .",
    "the analysis of massive modes of @xmath0forms has also been considered in the literature @xcite    after the work of rs several recent results have been developed based on the idea of thick membranes and its implications for brane - world physics @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these models is that the singularity generated by the brane is eliminated . in this scenario",
    "a transfer matrix method has been proposed to analyze resonances @xcite .",
    "however , when considering a smooth version of the model @xcite we find that the @xmath26 coupling in ( [ delta ] ) is still necessary . with this",
    "we get the unexpected situation in which we have a `` mixing '' of a smooth and a singular potential . for some of the smooth cases we are able to find analytic solutions ( for further analytic solutions see @xcite ) . when considering the resonances we must be careful with the mixing cited above . because of this we need to modify our transfer matrix program to consider a delta like singularity in @xmath27 . with this",
    "we analyze the resonances with the the transfer matrix method looking for peaks which indicate the existence of unstable modes @xcite .    here",
    "we show that the zero mode of any form field can be trapped to the brane using the model proposed by ghoroku and nakamura .",
    "we start proven that the equations of motion can be obtained without splitting the field in even and odd parts .",
    "the massive and tachyonic cases are studied revealing that this mechanism only traps the zero mode .",
    "the result is then generalized to thick branes .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we use the proca action with a coupling with the brane , similar to @xcite , to localize a transversal massless photon in the brane .",
    "we use the definition of transversal and longitudinal parts of vector field to decouple the fields equation , instead impose parity in fields .",
    "we find the coupling constant and the mass range that localizes the zero mode of reduced longitudinal vector field , leaving massive modes non - localized .",
    "we also study the zero and massive modes of reduced transversal vector field and scalar field . in sec .",
    "iii the same procedure used in previous section is used in a kalb - ramond field case . in this case",
    "the coupling constant and mass range is computed to localize the zero modes of reduced transversal kalb - ramond field and reduced gauge fields in the brane , while the massless mode of reduced longitudinal kalb - ramond field and its all massive modes are non - localized . in sec .",
    "iv we generalize the previous results for a @xmath13-form field in a @xmath28-dimensional bulk . in this case",
    "we find the coupling constant and the range of mass parameter which localizes the zero mode of reduced longitudinal @xmath13-form .",
    "we find an link between @xmath13 and @xmath28 which localize the massless mode of @xmath14-form .",
    "we also studies the both massive cases and find a condition localizing the reduced transversal @xmath13-form . in sec .",
    "v we use the procedure used in previous section for a smooth warp factor scenario . unlike the case of thin membranes we find a fixation of coupling constant which localize all zero modes , for all @xmath28 and @xmath13 .",
    "we study the massive modes numerically using the transfer matrix method to plot the transmission coefficient . in last section",
    "we discuss the conclusion and possibles consequences .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the action used in this paper is the following @xmath29 this is the proca action with a coupling term with the brane used in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 , in ( [ delta ] ) , relates to above one by transformation @xmath30 ; were @xmath31 is a four dimensional mass parameter and @xmath32 is the determinant of induced four dimensional metric .",
    "the randall - sundrum metric in a conformal form , @xmath33 is used , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the warp factor , which will be maintained in a generic way wherever possible to keep the generality . taking the variation relative to @xmath36 we obtain the equation of motion @xmath37",
    "although we have a massive gauge field , taking the divergence , the above equation implies @xmath38 where @xmath39 means a derivative in @xmath40 and from now on all four dimensional indexes will be contracted with @xmath41 .",
    "fixing now @xmath42 in the equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) we obtain @xmath43 and for @xmath44 @xmath45 the only way to associate this to a massive gauge field in four dimension is to have the condition @xmath46 satisfied .",
    "this is not true since we must have ( [ divergence ] ) .",
    "however , we can split our field in two parts @xmath47 , where @xmath48 stands for longitudinal and @xmath49 stands for transversal with @xmath50 next step is to show that the above equations can give effective equations for a massive gauge field in four dimensions and a massive scalar field ( zero form ) defined by @xmath51 .",
    "the first thing we observe is that ( [ divergence ] ) will give a relation between the scalar field and the longitudinal part of @xmath52 . for the equations of motion we use the following properties @xmath53 and we get , from ( [ proca5 ] ) @xmath54 and , from ( [ procanu ] ) @xmath55 the longitudinal ,",
    "the transversal and the scalar field ( @xmath56 ) are coupled .    for the scalar field",
    "the divergence equation ( [ divergence ] ) can be used in ( [ eqylphi ] ) to give us , for @xmath57 @xmath58-{\\mbox{e}}^{2a}m^{2}\\phi=0\\ ] ] and the boundary condition @xmath59 the two equations above can be rewritten as @xmath60-{\\mbox{e}}^{2a}(m^{2}+c\\delta(z))\\phi=0,\\ ] ] for all @xmath40 .    at this point ref .",
    "@xcite used an unnatural procedure to cancel the last two terms of ( [ xtxl])and obtain a mass equation for the transversal part of the vector field .",
    "this is done by imposing some parities to the fields such that theses terms disappear .",
    "however , this is not necessary as can be seen : first note that the field @xmath61 satisfy the traceless condition , and an equation for a massive gauge field should appear naturally no matter the parity of the fields . the only way to have that is canceling the longitudinal part by the scalar field part . in order to prove that , the definition of @xmath62 is used leading to @xmath63 where in the last equation we have used equation ( [ proca5 ] ) .",
    "using now the divergence equation we get @xmath64 this term cancels the longitudinal part of ( [ xtxl])leading to @xmath65 finally a set of decoupled equations is obtained governing the transversal part of gauge field , eq .",
    "( [ xtfull ] ) , and the scalar field , eq .",
    "( [ phifull ] ) .",
    "the vector field longitudinal part is linked to the scalar field ( [ divergence ] ) .    for the transversal part of @xmath52 a separation of variables @xmath66 in ( [ xtfull ] ) is used to obtain the following set of equations @xmath67 where the prime means a derivative in @xmath40 .",
    "the former is the equation of a reduced massive gauge field , while the later is the equation governing the localization factor @xmath68 . to put equation ( [ eqf ] ) in a schrdinger form the transformation @xmath69",
    "is used , with the effective potential @xmath70 and using the randall - sundrum metric ( [ rsmetric ] ) we can write @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "this potential provides the solution for the zero mode @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are constants and @xmath76 .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath27 impose the following relation @xmath77 to get a desired localized solution we need fix @xmath78 , i.e. , we need fix the free parameter @xmath19 as @xmath79 or , in terms of four dimensional mass parameter @xmath80 therefore we see that any solution with @xmath81 will give a localized solution .",
    "it is important to point that the four dimension mass parameter does not depends on @xmath82 , is just fine - tuned with the five dimensional mass and the cosmological constant in bulk . for the massive modes we have a non - localized solution given by @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are constants . to fit the boundary condition this constants must satisfy @xmath86",
    "the above condition do not allow @xmath87 to obtain a localized solution .",
    "then the massive modes are non - localized . to obtain more information about massive modes one can evaluate the transmission coefficient .",
    "for this we will write the solution ( [ psimas ] ) in the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the hankel functions of first and second kind respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath92 leads to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the wronskian taking at @xmath27 .",
    "this function is constant for the schrdinger s equation and can be computed using the asymptotic behavior of the hankel function .",
    "the transmission coefficient can be written in the form @xmath95 to illustrate the coefficient behavior figure [ fig : tdeltavector ] shows the transmission coefficient against the energy , @xmath96 .",
    "the absence of peaks in the figure indicates no unstable massive modes .    , for different values of the proca parameter @xmath20 .",
    "we have fixed @xmath97 . ]    for tachyonic modes , taking @xmath98 in ( [ psimas ] ) , we obtain a non - localized solution given by modified bessel functions with a condition of coefficients similar to ( [ condpm ] ) .    for the scalar field , using a separation of variables @xmath99 , we obtain from ( [ phifull ] ) , the set of equations @xmath100'-{\\mbox{e}}^{2a}(m^{2}+c\\delta(z))u(z)= -m_{\\phi}^{2}u(z).\\label{equ}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first is the equation of reduced massive scalar field , while the second is the equation governing the localization factor @xmath101 . using the transformation @xmath102 we can write eq .",
