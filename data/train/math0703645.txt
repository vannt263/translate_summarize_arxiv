    "in this paper , we classify the lagrangian surfaces of @xmath0 which are foliated either by round circles ( henceforth called _ cyclic _ surfaces ) or by straight lines ( _ ruled _ surfaces ) .",
    "this completes a former paper of the authors together with ildefonso castro @xcite in which all lagrangian submanifolds of @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , which are foliated by round @xmath3-spheres were characterized .",
    "the reason for the lower bound on the dimension was the following : since the submanifold is lagrangian , any spherical leaf must be isotropic ; when the dimension of this leaf is at least two , it spans a linear space which is itself lagrangian .",
    "this observation simplifies the structure of the problem , roughly speaking by reducing the underlying group structure from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "however this reduction no longer holds in dimension two , see for instance the lagrangian cylinder @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a real line of @xmath8 : this ( lagrangian ) surface is foliated by circles which are contained in non - lagrangian ( actually complex ) planes .",
    "other examples are the hopf tori studied by pinkall in @xcite . as expected the situation is richer in dimension two , and actually cyclic lagrangian surfaces come in three families , each one being described by means of , respectively , a planar curve , a legendrian curve in the 3-sphere or a legendrian curve in the anti de sitter 3-space ( theorems 1 and 2 ) . in the following , they will be denoted as type i , ii and iii surfaces .    in section 1",
    "we classify the cyclic lagrangian surfaces when all the centers of the circles coincide .",
    "we call those surfaces _ centered _ cyclic . in section 2",
    "we treat the general case which amounts to adding a convenient translation term . in section 3",
    "we apply this characterization to finding self - similar cyclic surfaces , that is those surfaces which are solutions of the following elliptic pde : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the mean curvature vector of the surface and @xmath11 the normal component of its position vector .",
    "the case of positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) @xmath12 corresponds to the case of a self - shrinking ( resp .",
    "self - expanding ) soliton of the mean curvature flow ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we show that a self - similar lagrangian cyclic surface is either a centered surface of type i as described in @xcite or the cartesian product @xmath13 of a circle @xmath14 with a planar self - shrinking curve @xmath15 .",
    "such curves have been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the hamiltonian stationary equation .",
    "a lagrangian surface is said to be _ hamiltonian stationary _ if its area is critical for compactly supported hamiltonian variations .",
    "such a surface is characterized by the fact that its lagrangian angle @xmath16 is harmonic with respect to the induced metric ( cf section 4 for more details ) .",
    "we prove that both in types i and ii cases , hamiltonian stationary surfaces must be centered , and we describe them .",
    "the study of the type iii appears to be extremely difficult to handle by manual computation , however we conjecture that hamiltonian stationary type iii surfaces are again centered .",
    "examples of such surfaces are described explicitly in @xcite . _ _",
    "finally we give in the last section a description of ruled lagrangian surfaces ( notably self - similar ones ) using an analogous method , recovering more simply a known result from blair @xcite .",
    "acknowledgment : the authors wish to thank ildefonso castro for pointing out a better approach to type iii surfaces due to chen and himself @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 a surface of @xmath18 foliated by circles with common center located at the origin of @xmath18 .",
    "locally , @xmath17 may be parametrized by the following immersion : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a positive function and @xmath21 is an orthonormal basis of the plane containing our circle .",
    "from now on we shall assume that @xmath17 is lagrangian with respect with some complex structure @xmath22 .",
    "we will often identify @xmath18 with @xmath0 in such a way that @xmath22 is the complex multiplication by @xmath23 .",
    "denote by @xmath24 the _ khler angle _ of the plane @xmath25 .",
    "note that the vanishing of @xmath26 means that @xmath27 is also lagrangian . in this case",
    "the analysis done in @xcite holds and @xmath28 takes the following form : @xmath29 making use of the above identification .    denoting by subscripts the partial derivatives ( the prime corresponding also to the derivative in @xmath30 for functions of just one variable ) , the lagrangian assumption is equivalent to @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath32 @xmath33 we see that @xmath34 which holds for all @xmath35 .",
    "the vanishing of the constant term implies that @xmath36 for some real constant @xmath37 .",
    "if this constant vanishes , we recover the case @xmath38 mentioned above and treated in @xcite ( cf also @xcite ) , so we may assume that @xmath39 .",
    "thus @xmath40 is completely determined by @xmath26 , and both are non zero .",
    "the two remaining conditions are @xmath41 in order to make sense of these , we will identify @xmath18 with @xmath42 , in such a way that the complex structure is given by the left multiplication by the quaternion @xmath23 . then any element in @xmath43",
    "can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 are two unit quaternions .",
    "notice that right multiplication by @xmath46 corresponds exactly to the elements of @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath43 acts transitively on pairs of orthonormal vectors , we may write @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the respective images of @xmath50 and @xmath23 , so that @xmath51 and @xmath52 . note that @xmath53 is not uniquely determined ; rather we have a gauge freedom by right multiplication by @xmath54 on @xmath55 .",
    "finally , we may assume if needed that @xmath56 takes any prescribed value , since we consider surfaces up to @xmath57 congruence .",
    "then the conditions in ( [ remainingconditions ] ) read as @xmath58 so , multiplying on the left by @xmath59 and the right by @xmath60 , and further by @xmath23 on the left in the second bracket , @xmath61 that is @xmath62 splitting and multiplying left and right by @xmath23 in the second bracket yields @xmath63 @xmath64 writing @xmath65 we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 the two right - hand vectors @xmath68 lie in @xmath69 and are either linearly independent ( over @xmath70 ) or both zero .",
    "so we have two cases :    @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 hence @xmath73 lies in @xmath74 or @xmath75 and conditions in ( [ remainingconditions ] ) hold . gauging @xmath73",
    "we may assume that @xmath76 or @xmath77 , and the khler angle is then @xmath78 or @xmath79 respectively , so that the radius @xmath40 remains constant ( and we may as well assume @xmath80 ) .",
    "this case corresponds to hopf surfaces @xcite , i.e. inverse images of a curve by the hopf fibration @xmath81 . after a possible change of variable in @xmath35",
    "( replacing @xmath35 by @xmath82 for some function @xmath83 ) , we may assume that the curve @xmath84 is legendrian .",
    "@xmath68 are independent vectors and span @xmath85 , thus forcing @xmath86 to lie in @xmath87 ; using gauge action , we may assume that @xmath60 is constant , and up to congruence write @xmath88 .",
    "reverting to complex coordinates , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , while @xmath91 .",
    "we may normalize , assuming that @xmath92 ( if @xmath93 pick the opposite orientation on the surface ) and set @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 with @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 lies in @xmath98 , the unit anti - de sitter space .",
    "again , up to a change in variable , we have a legendrian curve for the indefinite metric in @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 ( see @xcite or @xcite )",
    ".    summing up , we have proved the following    a centered cyclic lagrangian surface may be locally parametrized , up to @xmath57 congruence , by one the following immersions :    type i : :    ( complex extensors ) : @xmath101 type ii : :    ( hopf type ) : @xmath102 where    @xmath103 is any legendrian curve    of @xmath104 and @xmath105 is a real constant , type iii : :    ( de sitter type ) @xmath106 where    @xmath107 is any legendrian curve    in the unit anti - de sitter space    @xmath98 and @xmath105    is a real constant .    [ isotropic ] this analysis applies as well if we do not assume that @xmath28 is an immersion but only has an isotropic image fibered by circles ( we did not use the immersion hypothesis ) .",
    "so the same conclusion holds and will be used in the next section .",
    "type i surfaces are a particular case of a class of lagrangian immersions which has been first described in @xcite where they were called _ complex extensors .",
    "_ _ _    in the type iii case , it may happen that @xmath26 is identically @xmath108 .",
    "then we fall back on type ii with a legendrian curve that actually reduces to a single point .",
    "the image of @xmath28 is therefore a circle ( lying in a complex plane ) .",
    "we now consider a surface @xmath17 of @xmath18 which is foliated by circles .",
    "locally , @xmath17 may be parametrized by the following immersion ( identifying as usual @xmath18 with @xmath0 ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a @xmath0-valued function , and @xmath111 is a centered surface as in the previous section .",
    "note that we do not assume _ a priori _ that @xmath28 is lagrangian nor that it is always an immersion .    as we have @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the assumption that @xmath114 is lagrangian leads to : @xmath115 recall from the previous section that @xmath116 contains only terms in @xmath117 and @xmath118 and a term independent from @xmath35 .",
    "thus the immersion @xmath114 is lagrangian if and only if : ( i ) @xmath28 is cyclic isotropic ( cf remark  [ isotropic ] ) , and ( ii ) @xmath119 belongs to the symplectic orthogonal of @xmath120 . using theorem 1",
    "we infer :    * for type i surfaces , @xmath121 is lagrangian , so its symplectic orthogonal is itself ; hence @xmath122 for some real - valued functions @xmath123 ; * for type ii surfaces , @xmath120 is a complex line , so its symplectic orthogonal is the same as its riemannian orthogonal , which is @xmath124 @xmath119 is determined analogously ; * for type iii surfaces , one can check than a basis of the symplectic orthogonal is @xmath125 , where @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "so we conclude this section by the    a cyclic lagrangian surface may be locally parametrized , up to @xmath57 congruence , by one the following immersions :    type i : :    @xmath128 where @xmath123 are real valued ; in    particular when @xmath129 is constant , @xmath114 stays    within the lagrangian plane    @xmath130 ; type ii : :    @xmath131 where    @xmath103 is any legendrian curve    of @xmath104 , @xmath105 is a real constant and    @xmath132 a complex valued function ; in particular if    @xmath133 is constant , then up to congruence , we may assume    @xmath134 and the immersion becomes    @xmath135 .",
    "thus the immersed surface    is a cartesian product of a circle with a planar curve ; type iii : :    @xmath136 where    @xmath107 is any legendrian curve    in the unit anti - de sitter space    @xmath98 , @xmath105 is    a real constant and @xmath132 a complex valued function .",
    "[ autrebase ] in the type ii case , if the curve @xmath137 is in addition regular , we may assume that it is parametrized by arc length and another basis of the orthogonal space to @xmath120 is @xmath138 , so that the immersion may take the alternative form : @xmath139 this is a particular case of lagrangian immersions which have been recently described in @xcite .",
    "this alternative formula will also be useful in the next sections .",
    "in this section we study the self - similar equation in the case of cyclic lagrangian surfaces and prove the following :    a lagrangian cyclic surface of @xmath140 which is a soliton of the mean curvature flow , i.e. a solution to the self - similar equation @xmath141 for some non - vanishing number @xmath12 is locally congruent to an equivariant example described in @xcite ( in the terminology of the present article , a centered surface of type i ) or to the cartesian product @xmath142 of some circle @xmath143 with a planar self - shrinking curve @xmath144 .",
    "such curves have been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "_ the proof deals with the three cyclic cases separately : we first prove that a self - similar surface of type i must be centered , thus one of the examples of @xcite ; then we show that there no self - similar surfaces of type ii except the clifford torus @xmath145 ( which is also a type i surface ) and the products of curves .",
    "finally we see that there are no self - similar surfaces of type iii at all .",
    "_ case 1 : type i surfaces .",
    "_    a type i surface is parametrized by an immersion of the form : @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "following @xcite , we shall use the following notations : @xmath148 , and , assuming that @xmath133 is parametrized by arc length , we shall also denote @xmath149 .",
    "we start computing the first derivatives of the immersion : @xmath150 from which we deduce the expression of the induced metric : @xmath151 @xmath152 and a basis of the normal space to the surface : @xmath153    we now compute the second derivatives of the immersion , in order to calculate the mean curvature vector : @xmath154 @xmath155 this implies in particular that : @xmath156 @xmath157    on the other hand , we have : @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "we now assume that the immersion @xmath28 is self - similar , so there exists a non - vanishing real number @xmath12 such that : @xmath161 which is equivalent to @xmath162 in the latter expression , the left hand side term is linear in @xmath163 and @xmath164 and the right hand side term is a polynomial of order 3 .",
    "linearizing the latter , we easily see that the coefficient of @xmath165 is @xmath166 and the one of @xmath167 is @xmath168 .",
    "so either @xmath169 and @xmath170 vanish , or @xmath171 and @xmath172 vanish . we are going to show that actually if @xmath171 and @xmath172 vanish , then so do @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "we first write @xmath173 @xmath174 thus the derivative of @xmath175 with respect to @xmath30 must vanish , which yields : @xmath176 @xmath177 now either @xmath129 is ( locally ) constant , the curve @xmath133 is a straight line passing through the origin and the image of the immersion @xmath28 is a piece of a plane ( cf example 2 , page 5 of @xcite ) , or one can find find points around which @xmath178 does not vanish ( locally again ) . in the latter case we get the following linear system : @xmath179 it follows that @xmath180 and @xmath181 must vanish except on an isolated set of points of @xmath182 , which in turn implies the vanishing of @xmath169 .",
    "analogously it can be shown that @xmath170 vanishes as well , so finally the surface must be centered .",
    "lagrangian , self - similar , centered surfaces have been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we only recall here that such surfaces are obtained from planar curves @xmath133 which are solutions of the following equation : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the curvature of @xmath133 and @xmath185 its unit normal vector .",

    "we leave to the reader the easy task to check that if @xmath132 vanishes , the immersion is self - similar if and only if @xmath203 vanishes , that is the curve @xmath133 has vanishing curvature and thus is a great circle .",

    "we shall use the following result which can be found in @xcite ( proposition 2.1 , page 3 and corollary 3.5 , page 9 ) and that we state here in accordance to our own notations :    ( @xcite ) let @xmath253 be unit speed legendrian curve in @xmath189 and @xmath254 a unit speed legendrian curve in @xmath98 .",

    "the situation is somewhat similar to the self - similar case treated in the previous section : there are examples of non - trivial hamiltonian stationary centered type i surfaces , which are described in subsection 4.1 ; next we show in subsection 4.2 that there are no hamiltonian stationary type i surfaces which are not centered . finally , we prove in subsection 4.3 that the only hamiltonian stationary type ii surfaces are cartesian products of circles .",
    "similar calculations can be pursued in the type iii case , however the dependency of the translation term on the legendrian curve @xmath260 lying in @xmath270 makes explicit computations rapidly too complicated .",

    "using this last result , we shall now come back to the expression of @xmath328 .",
    "first , we have @xmath329 after a long but straightforward calculation , we get    @xmath330    thus the vanishing of @xmath312 implies four linear relations in the ( dependent ) variables @xmath331 , @xmath332 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 , that we write in matrix form : @xmath335 where we have denoted @xmath336 for brevity . we reduce it to @xmath337 leaving us with the following system @xmath338 the trivial solution @xmath339 being excluded because @xmath340 is not defined when @xmath341 , the determinant of the above system must vanish , hence the following algebraic equation @xmath342 in terms of the variables @xmath343 and @xmath344 , where we have divided by @xmath28 for simplicity .",

    "indeed any of the two equations in ( [ system2x2 ] ) yields a dynamical system @xmath345 and if we take for instance the first one @xmath346 the solution @xmath347 has to satisfy the analytic equation @xmath348 . taking",
    "the derivative leads to @xmath349 which expands to @xmath350 for a solution to exist , we need to find a common open set for the two algebraic curves @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",

    "let us solve @xmath355 .",
    "@xmath356 yields @xmath357 .",
    "evaluating @xmath354 at these two values yields @xmath358 which are non zero , hence the contradiction .",
    "finally we study the case of @xmath359 , where the system ( [ system4x4 ] ) amounts to @xmath360 and since @xmath361 @xmath362 @xmath363 so again we get a contradiction and the proof is complete .",
    "a hamiltonian stationary lagrangian cyclic surface of @xmath140 of type ii is locally congruent to a cartesian product of two round circles @xmath364 .",
    "_ as we saw in section 2 , remark  [ autrebase ] , a type ii immersion which is not a product of curves can take the following form @xmath187 where the legendrian curve @xmath365 is parametrized by arc length .",
    "we denote by @xmath366 the legendrian angle of the curve @xmath367 , i.e. the lagrangian angle of the plane spanned by @xmath368 .",
    "next we compute the derivatives of the immersion ( we set the constant @xmath105 to @xmath50 since that does not change the lagrangian angle ) : @xmath369 from which we deduce that @xmath370 thus @xmath371 we now compute the induced metric : @xmath372 and the first derivatives of @xmath373 @xmath374 @xmath209 where @xmath375 stands for the scalar product in @xmath376 .",
    "@xmath377 thus , @xmath378 @xmath379 @xmath380 for fixed @xmath30 , the expression @xmath381 is polynomial of degree 3 in the variable @xmath382 , and the only term of order 3 comes from the last line in the expression above : @xmath383 .",
    "thus if @xmath16 is harmonic @xmath132 must vanish , hence we are in the centered case ( hopf type tori ) .",
    "this case is straightforward : on the one hand the metric is flat and on the other hand @xmath384 , thus we must have @xmath385 . following the terminology of [ clu ] , the curve @xmath133 is _ contact stationary _ and take the following form : @xmath386 where @xmath387 .",
    "we observe that the closedness of the legendrian curve is not necessary in order to get a compact surface .",
    "the corresponding hopf torus is a product of circles @xmath388 . by making a convenient homothety",
    "we get any product of circles @xmath389 thus the proof is complete .",
    "let @xmath17 be a smooth , ruled , lagrangian surface . if the rulings are parallel , it is straightforward that @xmath17 is a cartesian product @xmath390 of some straight line @xmath391 , and some planar curve @xmath15 , such that @xmath392 and @xmath393 , where @xmath394 and @xmath395 are two orthogonal , complex planes .",
    "so from now on , our discussion being local , we shall assume that the rulings are not parallel .",
    "we now claim that , without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath400 and @xmath401 are orthogonal : to see this , we reparametrize the surface by @xmath402 , where @xmath403 is some real function .",
    "we observe that the images of @xmath28 and @xmath404 are the same .",
    "then we compute @xmath405 thus by choosing @xmath406 such that @xmath407 , we may reparametrize our surface such that @xmath408 and @xmath409 are orthogonal .    the lagrangian assumption amounts to @xmath410",
    "the vanishing of @xmath411 means that the curve @xmath133 is legendrian .",
    "it follows that @xmath412 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath413 .",
    "thus the conditions @xmath414 and @xmath415 imply that there exists a planar curve @xmath416 such that @xmath417 .",
    "so we have shown the first part of the following :    a smooth , ruled , lagrangian surface of @xmath140 is either the cartesian product @xmath418 of a straight line @xmath7 with a planar curve @xmath15 or may be locally parametrized by an immersion of the form @xmath419 where @xmath253 is some legendrian curve of @xmath189 and @xmath420 is some planar curve . moreover , the only self - similar ruled lagrangian surfaces of @xmath140 are cartesian products @xmath418 , where @xmath7 is a straight line and @xmath144 is a planar self - similar curve ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "we start computing the first derivatives of the immersion : @xmath421 from which we deduce the expression of the induced metric : @xmath422 and a basis of the normal bundle : @xmath423 we now compute some second derivatives : @xmath424 we deduce that @xmath425    on another hand , we have : @xmath426 which clearly does not depend on @xmath35 .",
    "so the equation @xmath427 can never hold for such an immersion , so the only self - similar ruled lagrangian surfaces are products @xmath390 .",
    "it is then straightforward to see that the curve @xmath144 must be a solution of the self - similar equation ."
