    "ultrathin films and heterostructures of transition - metal oxides ( tmos ) have attracted considerable interest in the past decade .",
    "recent advances in tmo heterostructure and strain engineering have provided increased control of the electronic properties of tmos .",
    "furthermore , these structures exhibit novel behavior not found in their bulk counterparts.@xcite    the family of rare - earth nickelates,@xcite rnio@xmath0 , has attracted particular attention in this context .",
    "indeed , this class of materials has a rich phase diagram displaying a metal - to - paramagnetic - insulator , as well as a metal - to - magnetic - insulator transitions .",
    "these transitions are affected by the structural distortions depending , in turn , on the radius of the rare - earth ion .",
    "this interplay between structural and electronic properties makes this class of materials particularly suitable for heterostructure and strain engineering .    in this paper , we focus on lanio@xmath3(lno ) . in bulk equilibrium form ,",
    "this material is an exception among the rnio@xmath0 family since it remains a paramagnetic metal down to the lowest temperatures.@xcite this metal has a rather high degree of electronic correlations , however , as signaled by the enhancement of the effective mass and susceptibility as compared to band values , as well as the sizable @xmath4 coefficient of the resistivity .",
    "@xcite one may thus expect that this material can be rather easily tuned to become an insulator .",
    "indeed , ultrathin lno films were shown to become insulating under either dimensionality control @xcite or epitaxial strain.@xcite it was also demonstrated that both strain and dimensional confinement can drive an lno film towards a spin - density - wave state , which is similar to what is observed in the insulating phase of other nickelates.@xcite this makes lanio@xmath3a very suitable system for materials design by strain engineering and heterostructuring .    in a pioneering article , chaloupka and khaliullin@xcite",
    "proposed that strained heterostructures of lno could be used to engineer a material having an electronic structure consisting of a single band crossing the fermi level . in view of the strong electronic correlations in the ni @xmath5-shell",
    ", the low - energy effective model describing such a material might thus be quite analogous to the one appropriate for cuprates , hence suggesting a favorable situation for strong superexchange and possible high-@xmath6 superconductivity .",
    "indeed , the low - energy electronic structure at the fermi level of bulk lanio@xmath3is primarily determined by the ni@xmath7 degenerate @xmath8 states which form a two - sheet fermi surface.@xcite one of the major effects of epitaxial strain or heterostructuring is the degeneracy lifting of the @xmath8 states , resulting in ` orbital polarization ' ( op ) of the electronic structure .",
    "the key question is whether conditions can be found such that this op is large and the quasi two - dimensional @xmath9 band is a dominantly occupied one with proper filling .",
    "this issue was previously investigated by hansmann _ _ et al.__@xcite and han _",
    "et al._,@xcite for lanio@xmath0/laalo@xmath0 heterostructures , and proposals for achieving high op by using other lno - based heterostructures@xcite or chemical control by other counterions@xcite were made .    from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "the degree of orbital polarization has been a subject of controversy , mainly due to the need for a proper treatment of both strong correlation effects in the ni @xmath5-shell and of the strong hybridization effects with oxygen ligands.@xcite in the work of hansmann _",
    "et al._,@xcite a low - energy description involving only the two @xmath10-like bands occupied by a single electron was considered ( corresponding to the nominal @xmath2 occupancy of the ni @xmath5-shell ) .",
    "it was concluded there that correlation effects may lead to a considerable enhancement of the op , mostly due to the effect of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath11 , as emphasized in previous model studies.@xcite this conclusion was challenged by han _",
    "et al._,@xcite who pointed out that the joint effect of the hund s rule coupling and of the strong hybridization with the ligand ( associated with the relevance of the @xmath1 configuration ) acts to reduce the op , possibly down to a lower value than the one expected from bandstructure calculations neglecting strong correlation effects .",
    "these issues were also considered at the model level in ref .  .",
    "on the experimental side , x - ray absorption ( xas ) and x - ray linear dichroism ( xld ) spectroscopy , combined with resonant reflectivity , were recently performed@xcite for a series of lno heterostructures under a wide range of strains from @xmath12% to @xmath13% .",
    "these data clearly revealed that an orbital polarization @xmath14 as high as 20 - 25% is achieved under tensile strain , with an essentially linear dependence of the polarization on strain .",
    "note however that the results of another experimental investigation on thin films were interpreted as the occurrence of an octahedral breathing - mode distortion under tensile strain with negligible orbital polarization.@xcite    in this work , we investigate how strain affects the orbital degrees of freedom in lanio@xmath3epitaxial films .",
    "we take into account both the effect of strain - induced structural distortions and electronic correlations using many - body electronic structure methods .",
    "the calculated values of the orbital polarization as a function of strain are in good agreement with the experimental results of ref .  .",
    "we also find that , for realistic values of interaction parameters , correlation effects associated with the hund s rule coupling reduce the strain - induced polarization as compared to the value obtained from band - structure calculations , in agreement with the conclusions of previous works.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . to begin with , we consider the effects of strain on the crystal structure of lanio@xmath3 in sec .  [ sec : struct ] .",
    "then we discuss the strain - induced orbital polarization , first from a bandstructure standpoint ( sec .",
    "[ sec : op_gga ] ) and then including electronic correlation effects in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmft ] . finally , we compare our theoretical calculations to experimental results and discuss in some details interpretations of the latter in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] .",
    "readers mostly interested in the final results may jump to this last section and , in particular , to figs .",
    "[ fig : op_exp ] ,  [ fig : rhole ] .",
    "also , some additional details can be found in appendixes a and b.",
    "most of the rare - earth ( re ) nickelates possess a perovskite abo@xmath3 structure with various distortions depending on the temperature and composition.@xcite in particular , the difference in ionic radii and the mismatch of the b - o and a - o equilibrium bond lengths @xmath15 result in octahedral tilts whose magnitude can be related to the tolerance ratio , @xmath16 , quantifying the deviation of the bond - length ratio from the one of the ideal perovskite structure .",
    "the octahedral tilts lead to the decrease of ni - o - ni bond angles and the reduction of the ni@xmath5-o@xmath17 hybridization , which , in turn , has a significant impact on the electronic structure .",
    "this effect is manifested in a direct dependence of the temperature of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) on @xmath18 , with smaller @xmath18 leading to higher critical temperatures.@xcite bulk lanio@xmath3 , having the largest value of @xmath18 , is the only compound in the family of re nickelates that remains metallic and does not undergo a transition down to lowest temperatures .",
    "bulk lanio@xmath3has a perovskite structure with a rhombohedral distortion of the unit cell and the corresponding space group is @xmath19.@xcite the rhombohedral distortion is induced by rotations of ni - o octahedra with a rotation pattern of type @xmath20 ( in glazer notation @xcite ) , which means that rotations around all three axes are anti - phase ( the direction of the rotation around an axis is alternating along the given axis ) .",
    "this is in contrast to other nickelates having rotation pattern @xmath21 ( gdfeo@xmath3 type ) , i.e. with rotations around the @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes being anti - phase and the rotation around the @xmath24 axis in - phase .",
    "the aim of this section is to determine how strain affects the structure of , as compared to the unstrained bulk .",
    "we consider a layer of lanio@xmath3on a cubic or tetragonal substrate with a square in - plane face of the pseudo - cubic cell ( as in sto or lsat substrates ) .",
    "a mismatch of the equilibrium lattice parameter between lno and the substrate causes the lno layer to be subject to biaxial strain in the @xmath25-plane . in nickelate films",
    "the strain can be sustained within rather thick films up to 2050 atomic layers ( depending on strain),@xcite and we can thus neglect film - substrate interfacial as well as surface effects .",
    "the effect of the strain reduces then to a geometrical constraint on the bottom in - plane face of the pseudo - cubic cell of lno .   or @xmath23 axis ) on the film even when the biaxial strain is zero ( as defined from the ratio of the lattice constants ) .",
    "] hence , a sufficiently thick film can be modeled by a bulk - like geometry in which the in - plane lattice parameters ( as well as the angle between the in - plane vectors ) are fixed to those of the substrate and all other degrees of freedom are allowed to relax .    to identify the crystal structure of a strained film",
    "we perform structure optimization within generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite using the projected - augmented waves ( paw ) method @xcite as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) .",
    "@xcite the integration over the brillouin zone is done using a @xmath26-mesh with @xmath27 points and the plane - wave cutoff is @xmath28 ev . structure relaxation is considered to be converged when the forces are smaller than @xmath29  ev /  .    to simulate the lno layer we set up a base - centered monoclinic unit cell ( space group @xmath30 ) oriented in such a way that ni positions match those of b - ions of a [ 001]-oriented abo@xmath3 cubic substrate .",
    "this crystal space group is determined by the pattern of octahedral rotations ( see ref .  ) and epitaxial constraints and was experimentally found in lno / lao and lno / sto films.@xcite the in - plane parameters of the pseudocubic cell , @xmath31 , are fixed to that of the substrate , which determines the strain @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the pseudocubic lattice parameter of bulk lno ( @xmath34 as obtained within gga ) .",
    "all other degrees of freedom , such as the out - of - plane lattice vector , oxygen and cation positions , are allowed to relax .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the case of a relaxed monoclinic unit - cell with the situation in which the system is constrained to remain tetragonal with no octahedral rotations ( relaxing only @xmath35 ) .",
    "indeed , this reveals the role of the rotations and unit cell monoclinic distortion in the structural response to strain . in the following",
    ", we shall refer to the monoclinic and tetragonally - constrained cases as ` distorted ' and ` tetragonal ' , respectively .",
    ", for the distorted ( solid green ) and tetragonal ( solid blue ) structures under strain .",
    "the broken line displays the @xmath35 ratio for the distorted structure ( for the tetragonal structure it is identical to the bond - length ratio ) . in both cases ,",
    "the strain is defined with respect to @xmath33 of bulk lno ; the shift of the zero - strain point in the tetragonal case reflects thus the difference in the lattice constants of the two types of structures .",
    "bottom : dependence of the octahedral in - plane rotations ( @xmath36 ) and out - of - plane tilts ( @xmath37 ) on strain for the fully relaxed distortedstructure .",
    "also , structural refinement data from ref .   are shown with diamonds for @xmath37 and with circles for @xmath36 .",
    "inset : inclination angle @xmath38 of the pseudocubic axis @xmath39 with respect to the @xmath25 plane . ]",
    "the first important effect of strain is the contraction / expansion ( for tensile / compressive strain , respectively ) of the unit cell in @xmath40-direction .",
    "this is measured by the @xmath41 ratio , or equivalently , by the @xmath40-strain @xmath42 , where @xmath39 is the length of the out - of - plane axis of the pseudocubic unit cell .",
    "we display in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : coa ] the results for @xmath35 as a function of strain for both the tetragonaland distortedcases .",
    "if one compares the evolution of the @xmath35 ratio for the tetragonalcase , in which the dependence is almost perfectly linear , to that of the distortedcase , one can see that the octahedra tilts result in a noticeably non - linear elastic response . at the same time , the ratio of the octahedron bond lengths , @xmath43 , also displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : coa ] , is very similar in both cases , implying that the internal geometry of the octahedra is similar for the tetragonaland distortedstructures .",
    "the non - linear behavior of the @xmath35 ratio in the distortedcase reflects thus the evolution of the rotation angles under strain .",
    "another important structural effect , with direct consequences for the electronic structure , is the different pattern of octahedral rotations found for compressive and tensile strains ( the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : coa ] ) , as previously discussed in ref .  .",
    "octahedral rotations can be characterized by angles @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath36 of rotations around the @xmath46-axis ( out - of - plane rotations ) and @xmath40 axis ( in - plane ) , respectively.@xcite in unstrained bulk , all three angles are equal @xmath47 , and the system has a rhombohedral symmetry . under compressive strain , out - of - plane rotations ( tilts ) are suppressed and at the most negative strain only the in - plane rotation is left , with the structure approaching a higher tetragonal symmetry .",
    "the system under tensile strain , on the other hand , prefers octahedra to tilt , with the in - plane rotations being suppressed already at moderate strains . for strains corresponding to laalo@xmath3 ( lao ) and sto substrates , the angles are in good agreement with the available experimental data,@xcite as also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coa ] .",
    "note , however , that tilt angles in superlattices might differ from those in films .",
    "@xcite    this behavior can be considered as a second - order structural isosymmetric transition that the lno layer undergoes on crossing over from compressive to tensile strain , whereby the rotation pattern of octahedra changes from @xmath48 ( in - plane rotation @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) to @xmath51 ( out - of - plane tilting @xmath52 ) .",
    "the rigidity of octahedra dictates that anti - phase rotations around three axes in bulk lanio@xmath3must induce distortions of the unit cell , with the pseudocubic vectors @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath39 being inclined with respect to each other.@xcite in an epitaxially constrained film , the angles between @xmath53 and @xmath54 are fixed by the substrate and only the @xmath39 axis can relax in such a way as to avoid a strong deformation of the octahedra .",
    "this is perfectly illustrated by the dependence of the inclination angle @xmath38 of @xmath39 with respect to the @xmath25 plane ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : coa ] ) .",
    "the largest deviation from 90@xmath55 is taking place around zero strain , which is important for stabilizing the configuration with all angles being equal ( @xmath20 , as in the bulk ) .",
    "indeed , when constraining @xmath39 to be orthogonal to the plane , gga calculations ( not shown ) yield a very sharp first - order - like transition , with the @xmath20 configuration being unstable at zero strain .",
    "this is not consistent with the bulk crystal structure , and emphasizes the importance of letting the structure fully relax in the calculations .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that earlier works relying on gga+u calculations predicted that lanio@xmath3films experience bond disproportionation under tensile strain.@xcite however , these calculations assume some form of magnetic and/or orbital ordering .",
    "recent more precise results obtained within the dft+dmft approach indicate that gga+u overestimates this effect,@xcite and we therefore do not expect that the bond - disproportionated phase is relevant for the range of strains considered in the present paper .",
    "this is also supported by recent experimental results.@xcite",
    "in this section , we investigate the effects of structural distortions on the orbital polarization of @xmath10 states in strained lno .",
    "all calculations are performed within gga : the effects of electronic correlations in the ni @xmath5-shell , and their interplay with structural aspects will be considered in the next section .",
    "we start with a brief review of the basic electronic structure of lno .",
    "the formal valency of ni - ions is @xmath56 ( @xmath2 ) , with the ionic ground - state configuration being @xmath57 .",
    "this is only a formal assignment however , since strong covalency and hybridization with oxygen states usually lead to a nominal valency different from the formal one .",
    "the gga band structure of unstrained lno in both the tetragonaland distortedstructures is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_unstrained ] . the orbital characters in the local frame of tilted octahedra",
    "are obtained by real - space rotation of the basis by tilt angles .",
    "the @xmath58-like bands lie below the fermi level but are quite close in energy .",
    "they are completely filled , and their dispersion is relatively weak at the top of the bands  @xcite . the behavior of valence electrons is thus almost entirely determined by the @xmath8 states and the oxygen @xmath17 states hybridized with the @xmath8 states , i.e. , the ` @xmath10-like ' bands . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_unstrained ] , we also see that in the distortedstructure , the bands acquire a more mixed orbital character ( away from @xmath59 point ) in terms of the orbitals defined in the local reference frame of the ( tilted ) octahedra . as a result ,",
    "the relevant bands near the fermi level have a sizable @xmath58 contribution as well",
    ". vectors .",
    "the orbital characters at @xmath59 point are entirely determined by the local crystal - field symmetry . ] in the presence of epitaxial strain , the changes in the structure induce a lifting of the degeneracy of the @xmath8 states .",
    "this is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_strained ] which displays the gga band structure under a @xmath60 tensile strain . as expected , due to the compression of the octahedra , the center of gravity of the @xmath61 band",
    "is pushed upwards relative to that of the @xmath9 band .",
    "the bandwidth of the @xmath9 band is also reduced ( due to the larger in - plane lattice constant ) .",
    "the two bands , however , remain almost completely degenerate at the @xmath59 point due to vanishing @xmath5-@xmath17 hybridization at this point .",
    "point can be achieved by controlling the direct hoppings ( not mediated by oxygens ) between ni @xmath5 states in plane and perpendicular to the plane.@xcite in particular , hoppings are anisotropic in other members of ruddlesden - popper series ( e.g. , a@xmath62bo@xmath63 as in cuprates ) or in heterostructures .",
    "] importantly , the described properties are still valid even when correlations are taken into account ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the degeneracy lifting of the @xmath10 states can be quantified by defining the intra-@xmath8 crystal - field ( cf ) splitting as : @xmath64 where the level positions @xmath65 , @xmath66 are given by the diagonal terms of the local hamiltonian ( obtained by projecting the kohn - sham hamiltonian onto the @xmath8 states ) , which is equivalent to finding the center of mass of the projected dos for each orbital .",
    "this results in a corresponding change in the relative orbital occupancies @xmath67 , @xmath68 , leading to op quantified as @xmath69 which is the quantity of central interest in this paper .",
    "an important question is the proper definition of the occupancies @xmath70 entering this expression .",
    "we now address this question in some detail .    ,",
    "blue ( light ) to @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "a brillouin zone of the cubic cell is used in all cases . a clear flattening of bands ( @xmath59-@xmath71 ) around the fermi level is observed for the distortedstructure , as a result of hybridization with the @xmath58 states . ]",
    "tensile strain : ( a ) tetragonalstructure , ( b ) distortedstructure .",
    "a ` fat - band ' representation is used to indicate orbital character : red ( dark ) corresponds to @xmath61 , blue ( light ) to @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "the center of gravity of the @xmath61 is pushed upwards , and the bandwidth of the @xmath9 band is reduced . note",
    "that the two bands remain degenerate at the @xmath59 point . ]",
    "strong @xmath5-@xmath17 hybridization in transition - metal oxides makes orbital occupancies ( such as @xmath68 , @xmath67 ) quite sensitive to the choice of the local basis@xcite with respect to which these occupancies are calculated .",
    "this is particularly pronounced in systems with a small charge - transfer energy , such as nickelates , in which the orbital character of states close to the fermi level is determined by a mixture of @xmath72 and @xmath1 states,@xcite each of these states obviously having a different @xmath5-electron count .",
    "there are essentially two strategies to define the local - basis wannier functions differing by the choice of the energy window in which the projection is done , or , equivalently , by the choice of the subset of projected bands .",
    "the first way is to choose a broad energy window involving all ni @xmath5-like and oxygen @xmath17-like bands ( for lanio@xmath3this corresponds to bands within a range @xmath73 $ ] ev ) .",
    "the resulting localized wannier ( ) functions , @xmath74 , are well localized , have predominantly @xmath5-character and yield the total occupation of @xmath8 states close to @xmath75 [ ] . on the other hand , choosing a narrow energy window ( @xmath76 $ ] ev ) embracing mainly the @xmath8-like bands around the fermi level leads to extended wannier ( ) functions @xmath77 with substantial weight on the oxygen sites .",
    "these extended wannier functions comprise both the localized ni@xmath5-states and a linear combination of the o@xmath17 states having the same symmetry as the @xmath8 states ( @xmath78-states ) .",
    "the total occupation of @xmath8 states is @xmath79 in this case .    in this paper",
    "we will be using the -type of basis for the evaluation of the local quantities , including the op and cf splitting .",
    "there are two main reasons justifying this choice , as discussed in more details below : ( i ) this choice ensures that the calculated op provides information about the degree of orbital polarization of low - energy quasi - particle bands and ( ii ) importantly , the op defined in this manner is consistent with the one measured in xas and resonant spectroscopy experiments .",
    "regarding ( i ) , it is natural to define the op in such a way that a system reaching @xmath80 is associated with a transition from an initially two - sheet ( @xmath8-like ) fermi surface to a single - sheet one ( @xmath9-like ) when a sufficiently large cf splitting is imposed . in this case",
    ", the @xmath61-band becomes completely unoccupied and the system becomes effectively single - band .",
    "the orbital character of these low - energy bands is primarily determined by the symmetry of the local states , the latter being represented by both the ni@xmath5- and o@xmath78 states .",
    "such states are consistently described by -type wannier functions , @xmath81 .    from the experimental standpoint ( ii ) ,",
    "spectroscopic probes such as linear dichroism in xas and resonant spectroscopies@xcite are by design sensitive to the symmetry of the local states .",
    "when one wants to extract @xmath82 from the results of a dichroism measurement , one has to make assumptions about the overlap between the local exciton and both the @xmath5 states of nickel and the symmetrized oxygen @xmath78 states .",
    "since the latter penetrate quite deep inside ni - o octahedra , it is natural to expect a substantial contribution to the op from the oxygen hole states , which is well captured by the extended basis .",
    "in other words , we assume that xas does not promote a core electron to a very localized atomic - like ni state but rather to extended states of mixed ni@xmath5-o@xmath17 character .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : op_gga ] displays the orbital polarization as a function of strain obtained within gga .",
    "one can see a substantial difference in the behavior of the op in the tetragonaland distortedstructures .",
    "in the case of the tetragonal structure , the dependence of @xmath82 on strain is smooth and lacking any features , as expected from a simple picture where the polarization is induced by a uniform relative shift of the @xmath61-like and @xmath9-like bands .",
    "in contrast , in the distortedstructure the op is significantly enhanced over the entire range , except for a small region around zero strain where the plot reveals a transitional behavior when going over from compressive to tensile strain . at the same time",
    ", the slope of the op is almost the same at large strains for both types of structure .",
    "this implies that the enhancement is due to the electronic structure of the system at small strain .    to understand the cause of the polarization enhancement in the distortedstructure as compared to the tetragonal one , we plot the intra-@xmath8 cf splitting , @xmath83 , as a function of strain in the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : op_gga ] .",
    "in contrast to the op , we find that the cf splitting is _ smaller _ in the distortedcase .",
    "this is expected qualitatively : allowing the structure to relax ( mostly by tilting the octahedra ) will indeed alleviate the effect of the strain imposed on the structure and reduce the cf splitting . in order to disentangle the effects of octahedral tilts on @xmath83 from that of the change in bond length ratio @xmath43 ,",
    "we have calculated the crystal field as a function of rotation angles @xmath36 and @xmath44,@xmath45 , with the ratio @xmath43 being kept fixed ( inset of fig .",

    "this is because a rigid - band model does not properly take into account the non - linearities associated with relaxation and the intrinsic changes in the dos under strain .",

    "as emphasized in model studies ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , the on - site repulsion @xmath11 has a tendency to _ increase _ the op .",

    ", a small crystal field can fully polarize the orbital configuration irrespective of @xmath102 .",
    "however , this no longer applies when inter - site hopping is taken into account . in order to illustrate this point",
    ", we consider a simple two - site model ( fig .  [ fig : exch ] ) .",
    "each site carries two orbitals ( i.e. , we do not consider the filled @xmath58 orbitals ) , a hopping @xmath18 connects only orbitals of the same type from one site to another , and there is one electron per site on average ( @xmath2 configuration , corresponding to one electron in the @xmath10 shell ) .",

    "is determined by three types of superexchange processes shown in fig .",

    ", we mention that even though dmft considers a single - site effective problem , it does capture these inter - site effects in the response of the system to a _ uniform _ field ( coupling either to orbitals or spin degrees of freedom ) , as explained in ref .  .",
    "this analysis of course applies to the strong - coupling localized limit of small hopping , and should not be applied quantitatively to lno , which is a metal .",
    "however , it does make the point that hund s coupling acts to reduce the op even when the nominal atomic configuration is @xmath2 . at weak coupling",
    ", a perturbative analysis leads to similar qualitative conclusions : the orbital polarizability is enhanced by correlations , as compared to the free - electron one , when @xmath119 , while it is suppressed for @xmath120 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "we conclude that the hund s coupling - induced suppression of the orbital polarization actually applies to both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 configurations . in the latter case ,",
    "the suppression is mediated by intersite fluctuations involving virtual @xmath121 states .",
    "this suppression should not thus be taken as evidence that @xmath1 is the dominant component of the wave - function in lno ( although it certainly has a sizeable weight , in view of the strong hybridization with oxygen states ) .",
    "finally , we note that the analysis of the simple two - site model above shows that the hund s coupling tends to promote an inter - site ferromagnetic alignment of spins in the orbitally compensated state with @xmath109 , due to the inter - site orbital superexchange .",

    "the experimental results along with the calculated op already presented in the previous section are shown together in fig .",

    "the energy scale of hole occupancies of @xmath5 or mixed @xmath5-@xmath17 states is uniquely fixed by the extent of unoccupied ( anti - bonding ) states above the fermi level , which makes the hole op independent of the choice of the integration limits taken when evaluating the occupancies .    also , we note that the hole - occupancy ratio @xmath134 is less sensitive to the choice of projectors ( localized- or extended - wannier ) used in the evaluation of occupancies . within dft ,",
