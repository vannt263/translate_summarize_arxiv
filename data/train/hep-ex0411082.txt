    "the -leptonic widths provide information on the -structure and its production cross section in annihilations .",

    "the only direct measurement is  @xmath5=(2.890.100.06)10  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fey1 ] are shown the feynman diagrams describing at the lowest order the processes .",
    "the cross sections can be written as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , the interference term , given by : @xmath9 where w is the energy in the collision center of mass ( cm ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 define the acceptance in the polar angle @xmath12 ( see later ) and where @xmath13 for  and @xmath14 for .",
    "the @xmath15 term takes into account for the phase space correction : @xmath16 corresponding to 0.9993 with a negligible error . the interference term @xmath8 is linear in @xmath17 and it changes sign when w goes through the pole at @xmath18 .",
    "the angular distribution @xmath19 is : @xmath20\\cr      f_{\\mu\\mu}(\\theta)&=\\pi\\beta_\\mu\\left[1+\\cos^2\\theta+ ( 1-\\beta_\\mu^2)\\sin^2\\theta\\right]\\cr}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 the muon velocity . in the following we use data collected at cm energies @xmath22 of 1017.2 and 1022.2 , i.e. @xmath23 , and at the @xmath0 peak , @xmath22=1019.7 . for  we measure the cross section .",
    "since bhabha scattering is dominated by the photon exchange amplitude , the interference term is best studied in the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the cross sections for events with electrons in the forward and backward hemispheres . because of the strong divergence of the cross section at small angle , it is better to use an angular region around 90 , @xmath28 .",

    "isr , where one or both the colliding particles radiate a photon before interacting , reduces the cm energy , from the nominal value , @xmath22 , to a lower value , @xmath33 .",
    "isr photon(s ) , emitted mostly collinear to the beam , are not detectable .",
    "isr - fsr interference effect results in an forward - backward asymmetry . to enhance the @xmath0-meson contribution , a lower cut on @xmath34",
    "is imposed for both  and  processes .",
    "we define the variable : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the angles of the final leptons in the @xmath38 collision cm respect to the beam direction . in the hypothesis of a single collinear isr photon and for fsr photon(s ) collinear with the final leptons we have @xmath39 .",
    "if an event does not satisfy this assumption this relation is no more exact .",
    "to define our geometrical acceptance we use the polar angle in the cm of the final leptons .",
    "so in the following we refer to the polar angle @xmath12 as the average of the angles @xmath37 and ( @xmath40 ) in this frame .    the kloe detector  @xcite consists of a large volume drift chamber , dc , surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter , ecal .",
    "they are immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field of about 0.52 t. for electron and muon tracks in the angular region defined above the momentum resolution is about 310 , while the angular resolution is @xmath41 3 mrad .",
    "vertexes inside the dc are reconstructed with a spatial resolution of about 3 mm .",
    "the calorimeter , consisting of a barrel covering @xmath42 and two end caps , measures energy deposits with a resolution @xmath43 and arrival times with a resolution @xmath44 ps .",
    "large angle bhabha scattering and @xmath38 @xmath45 events are used to measure luminosity , @xmath46 , and the beams crossing angle .",
    "the beam energy spread amounts to @xmath41 330  for the cm energy .",
    "the luminosity has an energy independent systematic uncertainty of 0.6% .",
    "the absolute energy scale has been established from a fine energy scan at the @xmath0 peak corresponding to 500 nb@xmath47 of integrated luminosity , using the cmd-2 value for the -meson mass : @xmath48()=1019.4830.027 @xcite .",
    "the same data have been used to perform a precision measurement of the neutral kaon mass .",

    "the result of the fit , including the systematics uncertainties listed above is : @xmath57 the fit returns a -meson mass of 1019.630.05 and a cross section @xmath58  nb , being the expected one 39.6 nb .",
