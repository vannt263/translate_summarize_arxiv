    "the discovery of colossal magneto - resistance in manganese perovskytes , of relevance to spintronics and other technological applications , has opened a new field to the study of highly correlated systems ( hcs ) . in the three dimensional compounds like la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath0 or in the two dimensional ones as la@xmath7sr@xmath8mn@xmath9o@xmath10 the interplay of several degrees of freedom , charge , spin , orbit and lattice displacements",
    "determine the physical properties of the system .",
    "the interactions between the different degrees of freedom can not be reduced to perturbation theory as in other materials and the disorder produced by alloying to obtain the metallic state does not contribute to the clarification of theory nor to the interpretation of experiments .",
    "the recent observation of a insulator to metal transition ( imt)@xcite in pure lamno@xmath0 at 32 gpa and room temperature , well above the neel temperature ( 145 k ) and below the jahn - teller transition temperature ( 780k ) , opens the way to a study of the role of the orbital degrees of freedom on the electronic structure in a stoechiometric material .",
    "two theoretical studies relevant to this matter have appeared in the literature almost simultaneously after the publication of the experimental result : both papers are based on local density approximation+hubbard u ( lda+u ) approximation .    in the first one by wei - go yin et al.@xcite the electronic structure of the ground state of lamno@xmath0 (",
    "antiferromagnetic a phase ) is analysed to determine the relative importance of the electron - electron ( e - e ) against electron - lattice ( e - l ) jahn - teller interactions .",
    "it concludes that the e - l interaction by itself is not sufficient to stabilize the orbital ordered state and emphasizes the importance of the e - e interaction to facilitate the jahn - teller distortion .    in the second paper by yamasaki",
    "et al.@xcite lda+u and lda+ dynamical mean field theories are used to analyze the metal insulator transition taking place at 32 gpa in the paramagnetic phase of the same material .",
    "the authors conclude that the transition at 32 gpa is caused by the orbital splitting of the @xmath1 bands and that both e - e and e - l interactions are needed to explain the insulating character of the substance at lower pressures .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the orbital aspects of the insulator to metal transition . in order to include in an appropriate way the strong correlations induced by the dominant e - e interactions we follow feiner and ole in introducing auxiliary fields ( slave bosons , sb ) to the description of the low energy states.@xcite    we start by defining a simplified hamiltonian , two parameters : @xmath2 on site coulomb repulsion , and @xmath11 a measure of the jahn teller splitting , to describe the @xmath1 states of the system and use sb to calculate the lowest energy varying the parameters to obtain a phase diagram .",
    "this procedure allow to identify the values of the parameters that are appropriate to describe the transition , as well as the thermodynamics and transport properties of lamno3 in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "to describe the active electrons in lamno@xmath0 we use the double - exchange model that contains the essential physics of manganites@xcite .",
    "the four 3@xmath4 electrons in each mn@xmath12 site are polarized in the same direction due to the large hund coupling .",
    "three of them occupy the @xmath13 orbitals and are considered localized forming a spin @xmath14 , while the fourth occupying the @xmath1 state is itinerant .",
    "we treat the localized spin classically and since the fourth has to be parallel to the local spin we can consider the @xmath1 electron as spinless with hamiltonian @xmath15 where the first term , @xmath16 , is the kinetic energy given by @xmath17 with @xmath18 corresponding to the ( possibly site dependent ) orthogonal basis for the two @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the values of the hopping integrals @xmath19 depend both on the type of orbitals involved and on the direction between sites @xmath20 . in lamno@xmath0",
    ", there is a staggered order in the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane and the orbitals are stacked ferromagnetically along the @xmath23 axis .",
    "the dominantly occupied orbitals alternating in the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which define then the low energy orbitals @xmath26 in each of the sublattices , respectively @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding higher energy orbitals @xmath29 are therefore respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the hopping parameters between these orbitals are the followings :    @xmath32    @xmath3 being the hopping between @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) orbitals along the @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) direction .",
    "the magnetic order is introduced by modulating the hopping integrals by the factor @xmath35,@xcite with @xmath36 being the angle between the @xmath13 localized spins in the neighboring sites @xmath20 and @xmath37 a hopping phase . as we are interested in the paramagnetic phase that appears at room temperature @xmath38 , we assume that the localized spins are completely random and consider a mean field approximation in which this factor is averaged giving a value @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 are the same than for a ferromagnetic phase with a factor @xmath41 . in the following",
    "we take this renormalized hopping as the reference @xmath3 .",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction between @xmath1 electrons occuping both orbitals on the same site is given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 the number operators .",
    "finally , to model the effect of the jahn - teller ( jt ) deformation , we add a term that shifts the on - site energies of the @xmath1 orbitals @xmath44 in opposite directions @xmath45 which corresponds to a jt splitting of @xmath46 .      in order to treat the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , we used the slave boson theory of kotliar and ruckenstein@xcite adapted to our case of two orbitals instead of the two projection of spin .",
    "therefore , we introduce new boson ( @xmath47 ) and pseudofermion ( @xmath48 ) operators .",
    "the boson numbers @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the projectors onto the possible states @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 so that    @xmath55    and @xmath56    the original fermion operators are replaced by @xmath57 which correspond to a representation of the empty ( @xmath58 ) , single occupied ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) and doubled occupied ( @xmath61 ) local states by @xmath62 with @xmath63 correspondig to the vacuum state .",
    "the anticommutation rules for the original fermions are guaranteed provided the following constraints are satisfied    @xmath64    which are implemented by means of the corresponding lagrange multipliers @xmath65 . to recover the correct result in the uncorrelated ( @xmath66 ) limit , a renormalization of the bosonic factor in eq .",

    "the renormalized bosons factors take the form @xmath67    with this slave boson representation , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) reduces to @xmath68 where the pseudo - fermions number operators are @xmath69 .",
    "we have studied the solutions of this hamiltonian in the mean - field approximation , in which we replace the boson operators by their averages obtained from the minimization of the band energy . in pure lamno@xmath70",
    "the number of conduction electrons is @xmath71 and in the absence of charge ordering @xmath72 .  in this case",

    "however , an orbital polarization will induce , due to the electron - lattice interaction , a jt deformation .",
