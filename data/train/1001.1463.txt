    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) represents a macroscopic quantum phenomenon of recent broad research interest @xcite . since its first experimental realization in 1995",

    "the behavior of a bose - einstein condensate under rotation is essential for understanding many fundamental bec phenomena .",
    "for instance , its response to rotation represents one of the seminal hallmarks of superfluidity @xcite .",
    "however , once a harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensate is rotated critically , i.e. the rotation frequency becomes so large that it compensates the radially confining harmonic frequency , the system turns out to be radially no longer trapped . in the absence of additional potential terms",
    "the condensate would start to expand perpendicular to the rotation axis .",
    "for an overcritical rotation , this expansion would even be accelerated by the presence of a residual centrifugal force . in order to reach experimentally this delicate regime of critical or overcritical rotation",

    "@xcite to add an additional quartic term to the harmonic trap potential . using a gaussian laser beam propagating in the @xmath1-direction ,",
    "this has been realized experimentally in paris by dalibard and co - workers for a bec of @xmath2 atoms of @xmath0rb @xcite .",
    "the resulting axially - symmetric trap with a small quartic anharmonicity in the @xmath3-plane , seen by individual atoms , has the form @xmath4 with the perpendicular radius @xmath5 , as well as the trap frequencies @xmath6  hz , @xmath7  hz , and the trap anharmonicity @xmath8jm@xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the rotation frequency @xmath10 , which is measured in units of @xmath11 , i.e. it is expressed by the ratio @xmath12 , represents the tunable control parameter which could be experimentally increased up to @xmath13 .",
    "this highest possible rotation frequency seems to coincide with an instability which follows from a thomas - fermi solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "as long as we can ignore the presence of two - particle interactions and approximately describe the system with the ideal bose gas , its many - particle properties in the grand - canonical ensemble are exclusively derivable from one - particle states .",
    "when considering the thermodynamic limit , usually the semiclassical approximation is applied , where the one - particle ground state @xmath14 is retained and treated quantum mechanically , while all one - particles states above @xmath14 are approximately treated as a continuum @xcite .",
    "this semiclassical approximation remains reasonable good irrespective of the rotation frequency @xmath10 once the total particle number @xmath15 is large enough and the trap anharmonicity @xmath16 small enough .",
    "the latter condition implies that the underlying one - particle potential ( [ eq : trap ] ) has a small curvature around its minimum .",
    "however , in this context the question arises for which system parameters such a semiclassical approximation is not sufficient for a precise description of bec phenomena , as well as when it finally breaks down , requiring a full quantum mechanical treatment of the system .    in order to analyze this fundamental problem more quantitatively ,",
    "it is mandatory to determine the one - particle energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions fully quantum mechanically . to this end",
    "we apply a recently developed ultra - fast converging path - integral approach for calculating the imaginary - time evolution amplitude of general non - relativistic many - body systems @xcite . in this approach a hierarchy of discretized effective actions",
    "is introduced where higher terms , compared to the naive action , substantially reduce errors in calculations of transition amplitudes . in particular",
    ", this allows a systematic derivation of discretized effective actions of level @xmath17 , which lead to a @xmath18-convergence of discretized time - sliced transition amplitudes within the continuum limit @xmath19 of infinitely - many time slices .",
    "in addition , the improved convergence of transition amplitudes , calculated with the level @xmath17 effective action , can be used to construct higher - order analytic approximations for short - time propagators .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath20 time - slice approximation turns out to be valid for short imaginary times and useful for small values of the inverse temperature in applications in quantum statistical physics .",

    "[ sec : local ] is devoted to the calculation of local properties of the condensate , such as density profiles and time - of - flight absorption pictures .",

    "the grand - canonical partition function of an ideal bose gas is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 enumerates all possible configurations of the system , @xmath26 represents the inverse temperature , and @xmath27 denotes the chemical potential . as the ideal bosons do not interact , the system energy @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of single - particle energy eigenvalues @xmath29 where @xmath30 counts single - particle energy states , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the occupancy and the energy eigenvalue of level @xmath30 , respectively .",

    "this is practically possible only for a limited number of exactly solvable models .",
    "however , we have derived a recursive approach which allows for an efficient analytical calculation of a high - order short - time expansion of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "if we insert the expansion @xmath67 calculated to order @xmath68 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : aqnqn1 ] ) , we get the short - time amplitude @xmath69 which is designated by @xmath17 due to the fact that @xmath67 is multiplied by an additional factor of @xmath70 in the exponent .",
    "this yields a result for the exponent which is correct up to order @xmath71 , i.e. its error is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "if we take into account the pre - factor @xmath73 , the above expression for the short time amplitude @xmath74 gives overall errors proportional to @xmath75 in @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , in @xmath77 spatial dimensions , which is the case relevant here , the errors of short - time transition amplitudes would be of the order @xmath71 .",
    "however , if we consider the @xmath15 dependence of the above expression , the errors are always proportional to @xmath78 , since the pre - factor @xmath73 will be absorbed in the normalization of the amplitude @xmath66 .",

    "therefore , one can immediately use the above formula for the amplitude @xmath74 and calculate the corresponding one - particle partition function by numerically integrating the diagonal amplitude @xmath84 over the coordinate @xmath85 .",
    "for small enough @xmath80 the above formula converges rapidly , and the amplitudes can be calculated exactly for all practical purposes .",
    "we refer to this approximation as the @xmath20 approximation , since it corresponds to having only one time - slice in the standard definition of the transition amplitude in the path - integral formalism .",
    "however , the direct use of this approach has several disadvantages .",
    "first of all , one still has to perform an integral over the diagonal coordinate @xmath85 in order to calculate the partition function .",
    "second , this has to be done repeatedly for each value of the inverse temperature @xmath80 . and most importantly , one has also to extract the value of the ground - state energy in view of the particle number equation ( [ eq : n ] ) . in principle",
    ", this is done by studying the high-@xmath80 regime , where the short - time expansion ( [ eq : ap ] ) is not valid .",
    "although this procedure works also for lower values of @xmath80 @xcite , it requires the numerical calculation of the one - particle partition function and a detailed study of its dependence on the inverse temperature in order to obtain the ground - state energy with sufficient precision . for this reason ,",
    "the algorithm becomes numerically complex and difficult to use , especially in cases where the ground state is degenerate .",
    "the approach based on a numerical diagonalization of the space - discretized evolution operator @xcite effectively resolves all of the above issues .",
    "it allows the precise numerical calculation of a large number of energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of the single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "once calculated in the low-@xmath80 regime , these data can be used to obtain the one - particle partition function for any value of the inverse temperature @xmath80 in a numerically inexpensive way .",
    "calculations based on this approach do not have restrictions in the high-@xmath80 regime , where , in fact , they turn out to yield results with even better precision .",
    "in addition , the one - particle energy eigenfunctions obtained by the exact diagonalization will allow us to calculate local properties of bose - einstein condensates with very high accuracy .",
    "the most efficient method for calculating properties of few - body quantum systems is the direct diagonalization of the space - discretized propagator in imaginary time @xmath86 @xcite . here",

[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in the low - temperature limit the finiteness of the number of known energy eigenstates does not present a problem .",
    "in fact , a precise knowledge of a large number of energy eigenvalues makes this approach a preferred method for a numerically exact treatment of low - temperature phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - temperature regime , where thermal contributions of higher energy states play a significant role , is not treatable in the same way .",
    "this regime is usually not relevant for studies of bec experiments , but we consider it for the sake of completeness .",

    "that the temperature is high enough , so that effects of higher energy eigenstates can not be neglected , the inverse temperature @xmath80 becomes a small parameter .",
