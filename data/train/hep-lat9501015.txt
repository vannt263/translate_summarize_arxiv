    "the hadronic matrix element which governs the radiative decay @xmath0 is parametrised in terms of three form factors : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the polarization vector of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 the momentum transfer .",
    "when the emitted photon is real , @xmath9 does not contribute to the physical rate and @xmath10 . at @xmath11 , the physics of this decay",
    "is thus described by only one form factor , @xmath12 .",
    "the feasibility of the lattice approach has been demonstrated first by the work of bernard et al .",
    "in order to obtain the form factors at the physical point , we need to extrapolate both to large meson masses and small values of @xmath2 .",
    "the final results critically depend on the assumptions made on the @xmath2- and heavy mass - dependence . at fixed @xmath13 , with @xmath14 in the b - meson rest frame ,",
    "the following scaling laws can be derived @xcite : @xmath15 which are valid up to logarithmic corrections . on the other hand ,  scaling \" laws for the form factors at @xmath11 can only be found by using extra assumptions for their @xmath2 dependence .",
    "this procedure is acceptable , provided the  scaling \" laws derived in this way respect the exact condition @xmath16 .",
    "this is a non - trivial constraint : the @xmath2 behaviour of @xmath12 and @xmath17 has to compensate for the different mass dependence of the two form factors near the zero recoil point given in eq.([scala ] ) .",
    "for example , the popular assumption of pole dominance for both @xmath12 and @xmath17 would give that @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which is inconsistent .",
    "the assumptions on the @xmath2-dependence of the form factors can be tested directly on the numerical results , although only in a small domain of momenta .",
    "the numerical simulation was performed on the 6.4 gigaflops version of the ape machine , at @xmath20 , on a @xmath21 lattice , using the sw - clover action @xcite  in the quenched approximation .",
    "the results have been obtained from a sample of 170 gauge configurations and the statistical errors estimated by a jackknife procedure with a decimation of 10 configurations from the total set . for each configuration",
    "we have computed the quark propagators for seven values of the wilson hopping parameter @xmath22 , corresponding to heavy `` quarks , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and light '' quarks , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . due to memory limitations ,",
    "the propagators are  thinned \" .",
    "the matrix elements have been computed for an initial meson at rest and a final vector meson with momentum @xmath13 .",
    "we have taken @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the spatial extension of the lattice .",
    "the initial ( final ) meson was created ( annihilated ) by using a pseudoscalar ( local vector ) density inserted at a time @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , and we have varied the time position of the current in the interval @xmath39 .",
    "two procedures , denoted by  ratio \" and  analytic \" in the tables , have been used to extract the plateaux : the three point functions are divided either by the numerical two point functions (  ratio \" ) or by an analytical expression (  analytic \" ) .",
    "details can be found in ref @xcite .",
    "from our data , if we assume a pole dominance behaviour for @xmath17 , the mass extracted from the fits with the pole mass as a free parameter is larger than the mass obtained from the axial two - point correlation functions . as a consequence @xmath40 is flatter than predicted by pole dominance",

    "-.6truecm in the case of @xmath12 , the absence of data at @xmath42 and the large errors in the data at high momenta make it difficult to test directly the validity of the pole dominance hypothesis .",
    "we can use the value for @xmath43 obtained from the the condition @xmath44 , together with the point at @xmath30 @xmath32 in a fit of @xmath12 to a pole dominance behaviour ; the pole mass determined along this way for @xmath12 is compatible , though with large errors , with the mass of the corresponding lattice vector meson .",
    "more data ( i.e. with a moving @xmath45 meson ) are needed to test this point more accurately . as a matter of comparison",
    ", we give in table [ tab : tuntdeux ] the values for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) obtained under the assumption of a pole dominance with the lattice vector ( axial ) meson mass .",
    "although the quality of our data is not accurate enough to draw a definite conclusion , they suggest that assuming @xmath17 flatter than pole dominance and @xmath12 following pole dominance gives a good description of our data .",
