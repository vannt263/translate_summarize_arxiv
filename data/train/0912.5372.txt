    "observations in cosmology and astrophysics suggest the presence of a stable dark matter particle . recently the cryogenic dark matter search ( cdms ) experiment has announced what may be the first positive evidence for the direct detection of wimp - like dark matter  @xcite , including the detection of two candidate events , although there is a 23@xmath0 chance that these events could be due to background .",
    "a natural candidate for wimp - like dark matter is the lightest supersymmetric partner ( lsp )  @xcite in supersymmetric models which include r - parity conservation , which is usually the lightest neutralino @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "limits on the dark matter detection cross - section can be used to constrain the possible superpartner and higgs spectra which may be observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "namely , only those spectra which possess an lsp consistent with the cdms constraints as well as all other constraints are viable .",
    "the discovery of a neutralino lsp at lhc combined with data from direct and indirect detection experiments may shed direct light on the identity of the dark matter .",
    "ultimately , supersymmetry breaking and the resulting superpartner spectra should be understood in terms of a fundamental theory . at present , the best candidate for such",
    "a theory is string theory .",
    "in particular , type iia string compactifications involving @xmath2-branes intersecting at angles ( and their type iib duals including f - theory extensions ) have been an exciting direction in which to explore model - building and phenomenology .",
    "such models have been the subject of much study in recent years , and we refer the reader to @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "in contrast to phenomenological frameworks such as msugra , the supersymmetry breaking soft terms in intersecting @xmath2-branes are in general non - universal  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible to obtain a different parameter space than what is typically considered .    an intersecting d - brane model of this type with realistic features",
    "was first constructed in  @xcite and studied in  @xcite . in this three - generation pati - salam model",
    ", it is possible to obtain realistic yukawa matrices for quarks and leptons , obtain tree - level gauge unification at the string scale , and obtain realistic supersymmetry spectra satisfying all experimental constraints .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of this model at lhc were considered in  @xcite and  @xcite , and the implications for direct and indirect dark matter detection were studied in  @xcite . in the present work , we update these results taking into account the new limit on the dark matter direct detection cross - section from the cdms collaboration .",
    "although there is a 23@xmath0 chance that the two events detected by cdms are due to background , it is of interest to entertain the possibility that these events are real events due to dark matter .",
    "thus , we find that there are points within the parameter space of this model which are consistent with the cdms results and which satisfy all experimental constraints .",
    "we investigate regions of the intersecting @xmath36-brane model parameter space that satisfy all the experimental constraints and possess wimp - nucleon spin - independent cross - sections @xmath4 near the latest cdms ii upper limit of @xmath4 = 3.8 @xmath5 pb at a mass of 70 @xmath6 .",
    "the results of  @xcite indicate the regions of the parameter space we wish to target for wimp - nucleon spin - independent cross - sections near the cdms ii upper limit are regions with low @xmath7 and high tan@xmath8 .",
    "soft - supersymmetry breaking terms are generated using the equations given in  @xcite .",
    "the soft terms are input into micromegas 2.0.7  @xcite using suspect 2.34  @xcite as a front end to run the soft terms down to the electroweak scale via the renormalization group equations ( rges ) and then to calculate the corresponding relic neutralino density , while @xmath9 is determined by the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) .",
    "however , we do take @xmath10 as suggested by the results of @xmath11 for the muon .",
    "we use a top quark mass of @xmath12 = 173.1 gev  @xcite .",
    "the direct detection cross - sections are calculated using micromegas 2.1  @xcite .",
    "we employ the following experimental constraints :    1 .",
    "the wmap 2@xmath13 measurements of the cold dark matter density  @xcite , 0.095 @xmath14 0.129 .",
    "in addition , we look at the ssc model  @xcite , in which a dilution factor of @xmath15(10 ) is allowed  @xcite , where @xmath16 1.1 . for a discussion of the ssc model within the context of msugra , see  @xcite . we also investigate another case where a neutralino lsp makes up a subdominant component and employ this possibility by removing the lower bound .",
    "2 .   the experimental limits on the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process , @xmath17 .",
    "the results from the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag )  @xcite , in addition to the babar , belle , and cleo results , are : @xmath18 .",
    "there is also a more recent estimate  @xcite of @xmath19 . for our analysis , we use the limits @xmath20 , where experimental and theoretical errors are added in quadrature .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath21 . for this analysis we use the 2@xmath13 level boundaries , @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "4 .   the process @xmath23 where the decay has a @xmath24 dependence .",
    "we take the upper bound to be @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "5 .   the lep limit on the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass , @xmath26 gev  @xcite .",
    "we find the optimal cases that are consistent with the latest cdmsii data occur for @xmath7 = 500 gev and tan@xmath8 = 46 - 50 .",
    "the two cases for tan@xmath8 = 46 and tan@xmath8 = 50 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_plot ] , where the maximum wimp - nucleon cross section is @xmath27 pb for these two tan@xmath8 . the lsp for these cases is 99.5@xmath0 bino .",
    "in addition to the latest data from the cdmsii experiment , the limits resulting from the previous zeplin  @xcite , xenon  @xcite , and cdms  @xcite experiments are also delineated on the plot . for a gravitino mass @xmath28 500 gev ,",
    "the lep higgs mass constraint of 114 gev becomes too restrictive , hence , @xmath29 500 gev appears to be most favorable .",
    "the points near @xmath27 pb reside in the wmap 2@xmath13 relic density region , and these points generate the wmap observed relic density through stau - neutralino coannihilation .",
    "the intersecting @xmath36-brane model also possesses regions of the parameter space with chargino - neutralino coannihilation , and furthermore , both of these coannihilation regions can generate very small mass differences between the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) neutralino @xmath1 and the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) , either the lightest chargino @xmath30 or stau @xmath31 , and thus , a very small relic density . in this scenario ,",
    "the neutralino can account for only a small portion of the overall composition of the total observed dark matter .",
    "the remaining fraction of the observed relic density in this situation would be composed of other particles , such as axions or crytpons , or additional astrophysical matter . in order to enable a direct comparison of fig .",

    "this particular point lives in the stau - neutralino coannihilation region , as evidenced by the less than 15 gev difference in mass between the lsp @xmath1 and the nlsp @xmath31 .",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs mass is just above the lep constraint , and well within the discovery potential at lhc .",
    "the process with the largest production differential cross - section at lhc for this point is @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath30 are virtually degenerate , though the @xmath35 is lighter than both the @xmath34 and @xmath30 , so both the @xmath34 and @xmath30 will decay to @xmath35 nearly 100% of the time .",
    "the second lightest neutralino will decay to tau through the decay chain @xmath36 , while the chargino will also decay to tau through @xmath37 , so the end product of both decay chains for this point at lhc will be low energy tau .",
