    "although percolation is a problem which has been studied in great detail during the last few decades @xcite , and although many exact results are known by now , there are still open questions which either have not been studied at all , or which have not yet been understood .    in the present note",
    "we study spreading of percolation in form of an epidemic process @xcite . in the physics literature , this is often called leath growth of clusters @xcite . in this process ( which we assume to proceed in discrete time steps ) one starts with an infected seed as single ` growth site ' , and keeps at each time a list of growth sites . in the next time step ,",
    "the list consists of all wettable sites which are nearest neighbors to any of the present growth sites , while the old list is canceled .",
    "a site is wettable if it had not been a growth site before , and if it can be occupied ( in site percolation ) or it is connected to the present growth site by an occupied bond ( in bond percolation ) . it is well known that the distribution of growth sites satisfies at the critical point and for large times @xmath1 the scaling law @xcite ( * x*,t ) = 1t^1 + 2/_t ( r / t^z ) . here , @xmath2 is the well known critical exponent governing the fraction of sites occupied by the infinite cluster @xcite , @xmath3 is the critical exponent governing the correlation time if one goes off - critical , and @xmath4 is a dynamical exponent .",
    "the inverse of the latter is often called @xmath5 .",
    "finally , @xmath6 is a universal scaling function . in a purely geometrical interpretation of eq.(1 ) , @xmath1 is often called the ` chemical distance ' between the site @xmath7 and the origin , as it counts the number of lattice steps _ on the cluster _ needed to reach @xmath7 from the origin ( i.e. the length of the shortest ` chemical path ' ) .",
    "the main problem we want to study is the behavior of the scaling function @xmath6 for small @xmath8 .",
    "this has been studied recently by porto _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as usual",
    "one expects a power law , ( ) ~^g_1,0 .",
    "[ phi ] the authors of @xcite used an analogy with self avoiding random walks ( saw ) to conjecture g_1 = d_min - /(conjectured ) [ g1 ] where @xmath9 is the dimension of the lattice in which the cluster is embedded .",
    "this conjecture was then checked numerically and found to be satisfied is the density averaged over _ all _ clusters containing the origin , not only over the infinite one .",
    "it seems that the authors of @xcite wanted their argument to apply to the incipient infinite cluster only .",
    "they implemented this by analysing only clusters with chemical radius @xmath10 , from which they presented results for chemical distances up to 1800 .",
    "if there were a substantial dependence on the chemical radius , this would lead to spurious violations of scaling since @xmath11 introduces a new scale .",
    "but this dependence seems to be weak , as also assumed in @xcite . ]",
    "there are however a number of problems associated with that analysis .",
    "the first is that the analogy with saw is not very stringent .",
    "the analogous equation to eq.([g1 ] ) had been derived by degennes @xcite using the fact that the end point density is the order parameter field in the saw problem .",
    "therefore , there is no anomalous critical exponent for the number of self avoiding loops ( which have no end points ) , and this then gives an expression for the probability that a saw nearly forms a loop which formally seems to involve mean field exponents .",
    "the authors of @xcite essentially used these ` mean field ' arguments , although there is no analogous underlying field theory ( the field theory for percolation is potts - like @xcite ) , and we see no logical basis for eq.([g1 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the simulations used in @xcite seem far from conclusive . in these simulations , clusters have been studied with @xmath12 in @xmath0 and with @xmath13 in @xmath14 . in both cases , ` more than 100,000 ' clusters have been analyzed , at several fixed values of @xmath1 . in figure 1",
    "we show results for @xmath0 obtained by their method .",
    "each curve is based on more than @xmath15 clusters .",
    "in addition , in order to enhance the statistics , we have lumped together data with @xmath16 in each curve . in this way",
    "we arrive at statistics at least @xmath17 larger than those of @xcite . in order to see more details we do not show simple scaling laws as in @xcite , but show data multiplied by a suitable power of @xmath18 .",
    "if eq.([g1 ] ) holds , we expect to see a horizontal line for small x - values .",
    "although our data are certainly not in contradiction with this , the very large statistical and systematic deviations from such a line render any precise statement impossible .",
    "if we want a significant test of eq.([g1 ] ) , we have thus to proceed differently .",
    "indeed , for fixed @xmath19 there is a much faster numerical method .",
    "while the above simulations need a cpu time @xmath20 in order to analyze one cluster , our improved method is faster by roughly one power of @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume we want to test whether two sites @xmath7 and @xmath21 on a regular ( hypercubic ) lattice are on the same cluster , and want to measure the length of the shortest connecting path if they are .",
    "let us assume furthermore that the distance between @xmath7 and @xmath21 , measured as the sum of the coordinate distances , is even ( the case of odd distances will be discussed below ) . instead of growing a single cluster from a seed at either @xmath7 or @xmath21",
    ", we grow two clusters _ simultaneously _ , one starting from @xmath7 and the other from @xmath21 .",
    "we stop the growth in any of the following cases :    \\(1 ) both clusters have a common growth site . if this happen at time @xmath1",
    ", then there exists a path of length @xmath22 passing through this growth site and connecting @xmath7 with @xmath21 .",
    "since this is the shortest such path ( otherwise the growth would have stopped before ) , in this case the chemical distance between @xmath7 and @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "\\(2 ) the cluster growing from @xmath7 dies ( i.e. , has no more growth sites ) . in that case , there can not be a path from @xmath7 which is long enough to reach @xmath21 , and @xmath7 and @xmath21 are on different clusters .",
    "notice that both clusters can not overlap .",
    "they can not ovelap in a site which has the same chemical distance from both seeds , because they would then have been killed by rule ( 1 ) above . and they can not overlap in a site which , say , has a smaller chemical distance from @xmath7 than from @xmath21 .",
    "such a site would first have been wetted by @xmath7 . in order to be wetted also from @xmath21 , it must have at least one other wettable neighbor which was not wetted , however , at the time step following its first wetting .",
    "this is not possible .",
    "let us denote by @xmath27 the probability that an event dies because of rule ( 1 ) .",
    "it is equal to the probability that two sites at a distance @xmath28 have chemical distance @xmath22 , which according to eqs.(1 - 3 ) is given by p(t ) = ( * x*-*y*,2t)_t=0^(*x*-*y*,t ) ~t^- with = 1 + 2_t + z g_1 . inserting here the conjectured eq.([g1 ] ) , we arrive at = 2 + _ t .",
    "( conjectured ) [ lambda ]    during these simulations , we not only collect a histogram @xmath29 of the times @xmath1 when rule ( 1 ) applies ( which gives the distribution @xmath27 when normalized ) , but also a histogram of times when the growth stops due to _ any _ reason or , equivalently , a histogram @xmath30 indicating how many events have survived at least @xmath1 time steps .",
    "the numer @xmath31 of events surviving until the very end gives an upper bound on the probability that @xmath7 and @xmath21 are on different _ infinite _ clusters , @xmath32 . if @xmath33 ( which we expect for @xmath34 ; there are several infinite clusters for any @xmath35 , but the chance that they come close to each other should be zero ) , we expect @xmath30 also to decay with a power law , n(t ) ~t^- with exponent @xmath36 .",
    "this should be compared to the power with which single clusters survive , @xmath37 @xcite . thus according to the conjecture the difference in the powers is exactly 1 , suggesting that the present algorithm is faster by one power of @xmath1 .    in fig.2",
    "we show , for @xmath0 and @xmath38 , both @xmath29 and @xmath39 .",
    "we used bond percolation where @xmath40 exactly .",
    "we see large deviations from power laws , but these deviations are the same for both curves . obviously , if a pair of clusters dies , the chance that it dies because of rule ( 1 ) is finite and tends to a constant , and therefore = -1 .",
    "if we accept this , we can obtain the most precise estimate of @xmath41 from @xmath30 . in any case , even if this is not correct , we obtain from @xmath30 a lower bound on @xmath41 . since we shall see that this lower bound is larger than the value conjectured by @xcite , this is sufficient to exclude the conjecture .",
    "results for @xmath30 for @xmath0 are shown in fig.3 , for @xmath38 and for @xmath42 .",
    "each curve is based on @xmath43 runs with @xmath44 , and took about 90 h cpu time on a fast workstation . in order to compare with eq.([lambda ] ) , we multiplied @xmath30 by @xmath45 , using the exact value @xmath46 @xcite and the estimate @xmath47 ( corresponding to @xmath48 ) .",
    "this estimate is based on new simulations which follow exactly the lines of @xcite , but have four times higher statistics .",
    "it is fully compatible with @xcite .",
    "we see clearly that eq.([lambda ] ) is wrong since it gives a too small value .",
    "a precise estimate of @xmath41 is hampered by the very strong corrections to scaling visible in fig.3 .",
    "fitting these corrections by terms @xmath49 relative to the leading term and assuming that @xmath50 , we arrive at = 1.1055 0.0010 , = 2.1055 0.0010 , g_1 = 1.041 0.001 .",
    "[ mu ] basing the analysis on @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 , we would get @xmath51 .",
    "a similar analysis for @xmath14 is shown in fig.4 .",
    "this time @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 we used the value @xmath54 of @xcite .",
    "the most precise value of @xmath55 can be obtained either by combining the value of @xmath56 from @xcite with the value of @xmath57 from @xcite , or by using directly the estimate of @xmath55 from @xcite .",
    "the first gives @xmath58 , the latter @xmath59 .",
    "in addition we performed further simulations using the method of @xcite .",
    "together , all these combine to our final estimate @xmath60 .",
    "as seen from fig.4 , the corrections to scaling are even worse than for @xmath0 , and the disagreement with eq.([lambda ] ) is much less pronounced .",
    "it seems that eq.([lambda ] ) is just barely compatible with our data which give , after taking into account the corrections to scaling , = 1.353 0.003 , g_1 = 0.905 0.008 .",
    "we also tried to fit @xmath30 by an exponential plus a constant , the latter corresponding to events where the two starting points are on different infinite clusters .",
    "we obtained @xmath61 for @xmath0 and @xmath62 for @xmath14 , both for @xmath42 and for @xmath38 .",
    "finally , we should point out that the advantage of our two - seed algorithm over the naive one using a single seed is even more pronounced for supercritical percolation . there",
    ", the survival chance for an event decays exponentially with @xmath1 , while it would not decay at all for the growth of a single cluster .",
