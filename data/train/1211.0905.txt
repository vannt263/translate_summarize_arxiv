    "this edition of the _ quark matter _ series of conferences has witnessed an impressive number of new theoretical and experimental results , which is a testament to the activity in this vibrant field .",
    "we discuss in turn some of the new results that were presented at the meeting .",
    "starting with calculations of the electromagnetic emissivity of the quark - gluon plasma , photon emission rates have been known at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath0 , the strong fine structure constant , for little over a decade @xcite .",
    "given that rhic phenomenology seems to favor values @xmath1 , one may wonder about the size of next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) contributions .",
    "these have recently been calculated and a report on the results has been given at this meeting @xcite .",
    "the nlo contribution is parametrically of order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the strong interaction coupling constant .",
    "interestingly , the effect of small angle radiation gets enhanced at nlo , while the contributions at larger angles - of the same order in @xmath3 - get suppressed at nlo , owing in part to an interplay between enhanced scattering rates and a modification of the phase space .",
    "the net effect , shown in the left panel of figure [ phot_nlo ] , is a modest `` k - factor '' , which deviates from unity by at most 20 - 30% at @xmath4 .",
    "bearing in mind the caveats inherent to a perturbative analysis , this nlo study implies that the phenomenology that relies on those photon rates need not be redone .",
    "the techniques developed there , however , will be of use for other finite temperature applications .",
    "other communications on electromagnetic observables included a proposal to observe photons originating from qcd jet conversion by first triggering on a reconstructed jet , and then searching for the back - scattered photon correlated with this hard parton @xcite .",
    "this technique should avoid contamination from the direct photon sources without an underlying hard process , and suppress fragmentation photons which populate low values of @xmath5 .",
    "recent dilepton calculations were also shown which highlighted the effects of a finite shear viscosity coefficient on lepton - pair observables @xcite .",
    "the dilepton yields were shown to be somewhat insensitive to the viscosity corrections , but the dilepton elliptic flow - as quantified by @xmath6 - shows greater sensitivity .",
    "the absolute value of the predicted dilepton @xmath7 does remain small , which is consistent with the different hydrodynamic calculations of photon elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "these , however , are at odds with current measurements by the phenix collaboration .",
    "the theoretical results for dilepton yields were in accord with recent measurements by the star collaboration ( to be shown and discussed further below ) , and relied on vector spectral densities that were also found to be consistent with na60 data @xcite .",
    "the data there appear to be consistent with a scenario where the charm quarks loose energy during the viscous evolution , see figure [ phot_nlo ] , right panel .",
    "all channels of energy loss will need to be considered before a final assessment is made .",

    "this plot is from ref .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=39.0% ]    in what concerns non - perturbative techniques , advances in lattice qcd calculations were reported at the meeting .",
    "one result highlights progress in the study of quarkonium suppression as a signal of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it addresses some of the ambiguities in extracting a static quark potential at finite temperatures , by identifying the static @xmath11 energy using a spectral decomposition of the temporal wilson loop @xcite . that work shows , on figure [ qqpot ] , that the singlet free energy and the actual potential are only similar at high temperatures , and at that temperatures commensurate with that of the crossover transition the potential deviates only slightly from it zero temperature behavior .",
    "this step forward should impact some of the phenomenological studies presented at the meeting @xcite ( some of these results will be shown in sections to follow ) .         still in the context of the in - medium modifications of quarkonium , another lattice communication reported on developments in the determination of the _ dynamical _ properties of the charmonium spectral density @xcite . by extracting the spectral profiles through the maximum entropy method ,",
    "one can obtain the transverse component of the vector channel , and the pseudo scalar channel , both of which are shown in figure [ spectral ] . a clear momentum dependence is observed in both vector and pseudo - scalar spectral densities at the temperatures considered here , and dissolution is observed at @xmath12 in this quenched approximation .",
    "clearly , calculations at other temperatures are needed to complete the description of the fate of charmonium moving through the heat bath , and to make contact with results obtained from using effective field theory or ads / cft techniques .",
    "finally , results of calculations of @xmath13 suppression were shown , where the short - distance @xmath11 production cross - sections were evaluated using non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , and the longer distance in - medium effects were incorporated through formation and dissociation times for the quarkonium states .",
    "thermal effects , neglected in the bound state wave function , appear necessary to interpret the current measurements , especially at the lhc @xcite .",
    "effects of collisional , radiative , and net energy loss are shown separately .",
    "( right panel ) the individual and combined effect of the collisional and radiative energy loss on @xmath14 meson @xmath15 , plotted together with alice results .",

    "both plots are from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the properties of heavy quarks in the hadronic medium - either cold or hot - were the subject of several talks reporting new results .",
    "these included an attempt to calculated cold nuclear matter effects from first principles , and to estimate gluon saturation effects in charmonium production in d+a and a+a collisions @xcite .",
    "the results of a study on the evolution of heavy quarks in an evolving viscous medium were also shown .",
    "this evolution relied on langevin dynamics modified to also include radiative energy loss @xcite ( usually neglected ) , calculated in the higher - twist formalism @xcite .",
    "the time - dependence of heavy quark energy profile is especially relevant to lepton pair studies , as charm quark decays - for example - form an irreducible dilepton background , as discussed further in subsequent sections .",
    "the left panel of figure [ eloss ] shows the evolution in time of the energy spectrum of a 15 gev heavy quark , in a static qcd `` brick '' with @xmath16 mev .",
    "clearly , the initial delta function is quickly broadened and shifted in energy , the evolution is inherently non - linear , and the radiative losses are important .",
    "this point is driven home in the right panel , where both effects are needed to achieve a satisfactory understanding of lhc data of @xmath14-meson @xmath15 .    in summary ,",
    "some fundamental theoretical results were shown at this meeting , which reflected advances in our understanding of fundamental processes , as well as in the detailed modelling of relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "there were many new results shown for heavy flavor measurements , including those for @xmath14 and @xmath17 mesons , and their decay leptons .",
    "it is found that at rhic , the charm cross section follows the number of binary collisions scaling from @xmath18 , to d+au , to au+au collisions at @xmath19 gev  @xcite .",
    "nuclear modification factors @xmath15 of @xmath20 at 200 gev au+au collisions show a strong @xmath21 dependence  @xcite .",
    "they increase as a function of @xmath21 , reach a maximum value at @xmath22 gev/@xmath23 and then decrease . at lhc , the @xmath15 of charmed mesons",
    "are measured for @xmath24 gev/@xmath23 in pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev  @xcite . for @xmath25 gev/@xmath23 ,",
    "the observed suppression factors of charmed mesons are similar to those of pions at rhic and lhc .",
    "results from non - prompt @xmath13 measurements indicate that @xmath26 is larger than @xmath27 in central pb+pb collisions  @xcite .",
    "more precise measurements together with advanced theoretical calculations should enable us to understand the color and/or flavor dependence of energy loss in greater depth .",
    "in addition , the @xmath14 meson shows a significant positive elliptic flow ( @xmath7 ) for @xmath28 gev/@xmath23  @xcite .",
    "these measurements indicate that heavy flavor quarks interact with the medium strongly , which leads to a similar magnitude of suppression as for pions and generates a significant flow .",
    "heavy quarkonia are thought to be an excellent probe to study color screening features in a hot , dense medium .",
    "different quarkonium states are predicted to dissolve at different temperatures , owing to their different binding energies  @xcite .",
    "precise measurements of @xmath21 distributions of quarkonia at different centralities , collision systems and energies should serve as a thermometer of the qgp . however , in addition to color screening features , there are also many effects playing an important role such as gluon dissociation , heavy quark recombination , hot - wind dissociation , formation time , and cold nuclear matter effects  @xcite",
    ". collisions from asymmetric systems could provide additional information on cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "it is found that in 200 gev cu+au collisions , @xmath15 of @xmath13 in the au - going direction is larger than that in the cu - going direction . a model taking into account cold nuclear matter effects including parton distribution functions and the @xmath13 break - up cross section qualitatively describes the feature , but under - predicts the magnitude of the suppression  @xcite .",

    "we are in the era to study color screening features of hot , dense medium .",
    "w and z bosons and high energy direct or isolated photons are ideal probes to study the initial nuclear wave function effect since they are produced at initial impact and go through the medium with minimum interactions . at 2.76 tev , the w and z boson production is found to follow number of binary collisions scaling from @xmath18 to pb+pb collisions  @xcite .",

    "in addition to high energy photon measurements , lower energy photons are used to study thermal radiation . for @xmath42 gev/@xmath23 , phenix measured direct photon yields from di - electron measurements and found an excess in 0 - 20% au+au over @xmath18 at @xmath19 gev , which is exponential in @xmath21 with slope parameters 221 mev  @xcite . at lhc ,",
    "an excess of direct photon yield in 0 - 40% pb+pb collisions above @xmath18 was reported at @xmath43 2.76 tev , exponential in @xmath21 with slope parameters 304 mev  @xcite .",
    "if indeed the excess is from the qgp phase , the measurements at rhic and lhc would indicate that the initial temperature for the qgp evolution is as high as 300 - 600 mev  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
