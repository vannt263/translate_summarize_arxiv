    "how long does it take a random walker to visit every site of a confined domain ?",
    "this time , known as the cover time in the mathematics literature , has important applications in the context of robotics or computer science ( for instance in protocol testing @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , it is an alternative to first - passage times , which have been extensively studied in the last few years in fields as varied as chemical reaction kinetics @xcite or animal behaviour @xcite .",
    "indeed , the cover time can also be used to quantify the efficiency of the search processes where every site has to be visited .    however , exact results on cover times are scarce .",
    "important steps were achieved in @xcite , where the mean cover time of an interval was analytically calculated for one dimensional symmetric nearest - neighbour random walks , both for periodic and reflecting boundary conditions . in dimensions greater or equal to three , aldous @xcite has determined the leading behaviour of the mean cover - time in the limit of large domain size , which was reproduced by numerical simulations in @xcite . in the physics literature , hilhorst and brummelhuis",
    "have extended these results to the two - dimensional case in @xcite , which have been since then refined in the mathematics literature ( for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "all these results were obtained in the case of symmetric nearest - neighbour random walks .",
    "here , we focus on persistent random walks , which provide a minimal model of random walks with short range memory and have proved to play an important role in various contexts , including search processes @xcite . in this paper , based on rather elementary methods , we derive the exact expression of the mean cover time of a one - dimensional lattice by a persistent random walk with periodic and reflecting boundary conditions , which quite surprisingly has not been considered so far to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we consider a discrete time persistent random walk on a discrete one dimensional lattice ( see fig.[persist ] ) . at each time step",
    ", the random walker has a probability @xmath0 to continue in the same direction as the previous step and @xmath1 to go backward .",
    "note that the cases @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both particular because they are deterministic when the first step is performed .",
    "the case @xmath2 is a purely ballistic walk and @xmath3 is a back - and - forth motion between two adjacent sites leading to trapping effects and thus diverging cover times . in the following ,",
    "we take @xmath4        we first consider the case of an interval of @xmath5 sites with periodic boundary conditions , in which all sites are equivalent .",
    "in particular , the mean cover time @xmath6 defined as the mean time needed to visit all the sites of the interval @xmath7 $ ] does not depend of the starting point in this case .",
    "following yokoi _",
    "@xcite , we write the mean cover time for a @xmath5 site ring @xmath6 as the sum of the mean cover time for @xmath8 sites among @xmath5 and the mean time @xmath9 to visit the last site : @xmath10 here we have used that the mean cover time for @xmath11 consecutive sites of a ring of @xmath5 sites ( @xmath12 ) is given by @xmath13 .",
    "we next introduce @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) as the mean time needed to reach @xmath16 for the first time , knowing that the walker arrived at site @xmath17 from site @xmath18 ( resp . from site @xmath19 ) at time step 0 .",
    "these quantities also depend on the number of sites @xmath5 , but for the sake of clarity , this dependency is not explicitly written . note that , because of the boundary conditions , these conditions do not depend of @xmath17 .",
    "it is then easily checked that @xmath20 , which we now calculate .    to evaluate @xmath21 ,",
    "we actually compute the function @xmath14 for all @xmath22 , which is solution for @xmath23 of the coupled backward equations : @xmath24 t_-(d)=\\dfrac{1-\\epsilon}{2 } \\ ; t_+(d-1)+\\dfrac{1+\\epsilon}{2 } \\ ; t_-(d+1)+1 \\end{cases}\\ ] ] obtained by partitioning over the first step of the walk , complemented by the boundary condition @xmath25 . combining these two equations yields : @xmath26 which is solved by @xmath27 the boundary condition @xmath28",
    "gives @xmath29 while @xmath30 is determined by making use of the periodicity of the ring : @xmath31 .",
    "this finally gives @xmath32 and in particular @xmath33 using equation ( [ recurrence_periodic ] ) iteratively and noting that @xmath34 , we get @xmath35    it is then found that equation ( [ recurrence_periodic ] ) is solved by @xmath36 which provides an exact explicit solution of the mean cover time .",
    "note that in the large @xmath5 limit , the mean cover time @xmath37 of a regular random walk with diffusion coefficient @xmath38 is recovered , where @xmath39 can be shown to be the diffusion coefficient of a one - dimensional persistent random walk defined in the large time limit .",
    "in contrast , if the persistence length @xmath40 is of order @xmath5 , one finds that the mean cover time scales linearly with @xmath5 , as expected for a ballistic - like motion .",
    "we now focus on the case of a chain of @xmath5 sites , labelled from @xmath41 to @xmath8 , with reflecting boundary conditions ( see fig.[clr ] ) . to compute the cover time",
    ", we split the process of covering the whole domain in two steps : ( i ) the walker first reaches one of the edges of the domain ( @xmath41 or @xmath8 ) ; ( ii ) the walker then needs to cross the domain to reach the other edge .     from the left . ]      in this section , we introduce two quantities : the splitting probability @xmath42 , defined as the probability of reaching the point @xmath43 before the point @xmath44 starting from the point @xmath45 , and the associated mean conditional time @xmath46 , defined as the mean time needed to reach the point @xmath43 starting from the point @xmath45 , knowing that @xmath44 has remained unvisited . the mean time needed to reach any of the two edges",
    "is then given by @xmath47 we now calculate successively the splitting probabilities and the mean conditional times involved in this equation . as before",
    ", these two quantities depend on the direction of the walker when it arrives at site @xmath45 at step zero .",
    "the splitting probabilities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are related to @xmath50 by @xmath51 they satisfy the two coupled backward equations for @xmath52 : @xmath53 \\pi_{n-1}^-(0|x)=\\dfrac{1+\\epsilon}{2 } \\ ; \\pi_{n-1}^-(0|x-1)+\\dfrac{1-\\epsilon}{2 } \\ ; \\pi_{n-1}^+(0|x+1 )   \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    the two splitting probabilities are easily seen to be solutions of the second - order recurrence equation @xmath54 valid for @xmath55 for @xmath56 and for @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the general solutions read @xmath59 using eq.([pi ] ) and the following boundary conditions @xmath60 we finally obtain : @xmath61 \\pi_{n-1}^-(0|x)=1 + \\dfrac{1-\\epsilon}{n(\\epsilon-1)+1 - 3 \\epsilon } \\ ; x. \\end{cases}\\ ] ]      defining @xmath62 it is seen following @xcite that for @xmath63 @xmath64 and similarly , for @xmath65 @xmath66    we again combine these two equations to obtain a recurrence equation on @xmath67 for @xmath57 :    @xmath68    whose solution is given , for @xmath63 by @xmath69    with @xmath70 \\beta=\\dfrac{1-\\epsilon}{3 \\left(1+\\epsilon\\right ) } \\ ; \\dfrac{1-\\epsilon}{n \\left(1-\\epsilon\\right)+3 \\epsilon-1 }   \\end{split } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the constants @xmath71 and @xmath30 are determined by using the boundary condition @xmath72 and writing eq .",
    "( [ backwardr ] ) at @xmath73 : @xmath74    this finally leads to @xmath75 with @xmath76\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we next obtain from eq .",
    "( [ backwardr ] ) the expression of @xmath77 : @xmath78    making finally use of @xmath79 we obtain : @xmath80\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{reflecting}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we first introduce @xmath81 , the mean time needed to go from @xmath45 to @xmath82 , knowing the initial step @xmath83 .",

    "( [ coupled ] ) , @xmath89 finally , the mean time to cross the interval is given by @xmath90      we eventually obtain the cover time when the walker starts from a site @xmath45 that is not one of the edges of the domain : @xmath91 \\nonumber\\\\&+ & \\dfrac{1-\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon } \\left(n-1\\right ) \\left(n-2\\right )              + \\dfrac{2}{1+\\epsilon}\\left(n-2\\right)+2 \\nonumber\\\\              \\label{ref2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the cover time starting from one edge can also be written , partitioning on the first step : @xmath92 + 1\\nonumber\\\\              & = & \\dfrac{1}{2 } \\ ; t_+(0)+t_+(1)+ ... +t_+(n-2)+1\\nonumber\\\\              & = & \\dfrac{1}{1+\\epsilon}+\\dfrac{1-\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon } \\left(n-1\\right ) \\left(n-2 \\right)+\\dfrac{2}{1+\\epsilon } \\left(n-2 \\right)+1\\nonumber\\\\              & = &   \\dfrac{1-\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\left(n-1 \\right ) \\left(n-2 \\right ) + \\dfrac{2}{1+\\epsilon } \\left(n-2 \\right)+\\dfrac{2+\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this paper , we obtained the exact expression of the mean cover time in 1d for a persistent random walk with both periodic and reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "we now examine how the expressions we found in periodic and reflecting cases behave when @xmath93 and @xmath2 , and discuss the impact of the boundary conditions .",
    "+          the probability of going on in the same direction at each step is @xmath95 .",
    "trajectories are then ballistic . for periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the result is obvious . for reflecting boundary conditions , the cover time is the average between the two only possible ways ( starting left or right ) : @xmath96 this is recovered by eqs.([periodic ] ) and ( [ ref2 ] ) .",
    "let us compare the scaling of the cover time with reflecting boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions when @xmath97 , for fixed values of @xmath45 and @xmath98 ( still with @xmath99 ) .",
    "one finds : @xmath100    to leading order , it takes twice as much time in reflecting boundary conditions to cover the whole domain as in periodic boundary conditions .",
    "notably , this result does not depend on the initial position @xmath45 nor on @xmath98 .",
    "a monotonic dependence on these two parameters appears in the first - order term .    a first extension of this work concerns the determination of higher order moments of the cover time .",
    "even if less straightforward , the methodology used in this article holds in principle . for instance , in the reflecting case , the decomposition used in the key equation ( [ keyeq ] ) can still be used to relate moments of the cover time to the moments of the conditional first - passage times , which in turn should be analytically calculable .",
    "+ in the context of the search processes mentioned in introduction , an important extension is the generalisation to higher space dimensions , and in particular to two dimensions . such results would offer a new tool to quantify the efficiency of search processes , alternatively to the now classical first - passage times .",
    "in particular , an important question would be to determine whether the minimisation of the mean first - passage time found for persistent random walks in two dimensions in @xcite still holds for the mean cover time , and if so , whether it is reached at the same persistence length ."
