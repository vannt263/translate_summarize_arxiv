    "entanglement has been used as a key resource in many tasks in quantum information processing @xcite . as a famous example of these tasks",
    ", quantum - state teleportation @xcite means that an unkown quantum state is transferred among distant parties without physically sending the particle .",
    "another important task is teleportation of a quantum operation @xcite , where instead of an unkown state , an unknown quantum operation is transferred without physically sending the device .",
    "if the teleported operation acts also on a remote unknown state , this task can also be called `` remote implementation of operation '' .",
    "recently , researches on this aspect are made on both theory @xcite@xcite@xcite and experiment @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "when the operation is completely unknown , this remote implementation has to be completed via so - called bidirectional quantum state teleportation ( bqst ) @xcite , in which the receiver teleports his target state to the sender , then after applying the operation , the sender teleports it back to the receiver .",
    "apparently , only a pair of quantum - state teleportations and one local quantum operation are implemented , and the required entanglement resources double that in quantum - state teleportations .",
    "it is very interesting when the operation is partially unknown . here ,",
    "`` partially unknown '' quantum operations mean they are belonging to some restricted sets that satisfy some given restricted conditions .",
    "there are some protocols via which the partially unkown operation can be remote implemented using less resources than via bqst . in other words ,",
    "any operation in the restricted set with respect to a protocol can be remote implemented via this protocol .",
    "entanglement is a scarce resource in quantum information processing , and is more expensive than classical resources such as classical communication .",
    "so , these protocols need also use entanglement resources as little as possible , and this economization is not insignificant .    in the case of one qubit operations",
    ", there are two such restricted sets , and operations in either of them can be teleported via a protocol ( hpv ) using the least entanglement resources @xcite .",
    "these two restricted sets are one set which consists of digonal operations and one which consists of antidigonal operations . then in fact , hpv protocol may be considered as a group of two sub protocols with these two restricted sets respectively . in hpv protocol ,",
    "only one _ e_-bit of entanglment resources are required , and this is optimal .",
    "these results have been developered for multiqubits cases@xcite .",
    "operations in anyone of the restricted sets in which there is just one none zero element in any row and any column , can be teleported via an extended protocol ( wang ) using the least entanglement resources . in the case of _",
    "n_-qubit oprations , there are @xmath0 such restricted sets , and @xmath1 _ e_-bits are required in wang protocol , and this is optimal too .",
    "furthermore , hpv protocol is apparently a special case of wang s when @xmath2 .",
    "the restricted sets in wang protocol are matrices that has just one none zero element in any column or any row .",
    "if the none zero elements are replaced by full rank squre matrices which have the same order each other , can we find protocols via which the operations can be teleported using the least entanglement resources ? in this paper , we will propose a protocol by hybriding wang protocol and bqst , and furthermore , as their generalization and combination , it can be reduced to wang protocol , hpv protocol and bqst .",
    "this protocol will work when the restricted sets are @xmath3 block matrices which has just one none zero block in any column or any row , and every block of which is a @xmath4 full rank matrix .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "they also share the necessary entanglement resources and have some accessorial qubits that assist them to accomplish the object . as a result of an available protocol",
    ", bob must finally get the qubits whose state is the same as bob s initial qubits state operated directly by the operation under the precondition without noise channel .",
