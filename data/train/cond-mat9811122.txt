    "in standard random percolation , the universality of the critical exponents is quite familiar .",
    "the values of these universal quantities depend only upon the dimensionality of the system .",

    "even though one might use finite systems to measure such quantities , in the limit of the system length scale @xmath0 , the shape of those finite systems becomes irrelevant as @xmath1 exceeds the correlation length @xmath2 .",
    "however , if a system is simulated exactly at @xmath3 where @xmath4 is in principle infinite , or if one takes the scaling limit where @xmath5 approaches @xmath3 as @xmath1 is increased such that @xmath4 remains a fixed fraction of @xmath1 , then the shape of the system ( or the sequence of systems ) becomes relevant .",
    "this leads to another and larger class of universal quantities , whose values depends upon the shape of the boundary of the system and the boundary conditions , as well as the dimensionality . in spite of the resulting proliferation of classes ,",
    "one still considers these quantities to be universal , because they remain independent of the",
    " microscopic \" features of the system ( lattice type or continuum model used , whether site or bond percolation , etc . ) .",

    "these crossing quantites are all defined in terms of macroscopic features of the system , so universality is clear .",
    "recently , aharony and stauffer @xcite have examined the shape dependence of critical universal ratios such as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mean size ( in sites ) of finite clusters and @xmath8 is the probability a site belongs to the  infinite \" cluster ( one spanning the system , by some consistent definition ) .",
    "although thess quantities are defined on a microscopic ( site ) level , the microscopic aspect cancels out by scaling theory and the ratio is universal  but again system - shape dependent .",

    "demonstrating universality of @xmath48 by choosing only b - sq and s - sq as in @xcite may not be completely convincing , and one would like to compare , say , a tr and sq lattice .",

    "the discrepancy with the numerical values can be attributed to the small system size of these simulations .",
    "the torus with a twist has various topological symmetries that apply to any shape - dependent universal quantity @xmath75 , which includes @xmath72 .",
    "we consider a rectangular boundary with base 1 and height @xmath30 , with a horizontal twist @xmath57 in the periodic b.  c.   ( note that having twists in two directions leads to a non - uniform system , so we do nt consider it . )",
    "@xmath75 satisfies the obvious symmetries of reflection @xmath76 and periodicity in the @xmath57 direction @xmath77 another symmetry follows from the observation that the same rhombus can be made into a rectangle in two different ways , leading to : @xmath78 another construction shows that when @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an integer , @xmath81 which also follows from eqs .",

    "thus , @xmath72 must necessarily be a modular function .",
    "however , the explicit expression for @xmath21 does not display that modularity clearly .",
    "besides the excess number , another universal quantity on a torus is the cross - configuration probability @xmath85 , which can be expressed in a quite compact form . using the results of @xcite ,",

    "we have also measured @xmath102 in the @xmath103 and @xmath71 systems , with various @xmath57 . whether crossing occurs can be found using an indicator function , such as @xmath104 , where @xmath35 is the number of clusters",
    ", @xmath105 is the number of dual - lattice clusters , @xmath36 is the number of bonds , and @xmath106 is the number of sites . when @xmath107 , there is a cross - configuration on the lattice , when @xmath108",
    "there is a cross configuration on the dual - lattice ( these two events are clearly mutually exclusive ) , and when @xmath109 there is neither . in the latter case , there will necessarily be at least one wrap - around cluster on the lattice or dual - lattice , or a spiral .",
    "another indicator function can be made using the number of hulls in the system @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the measured @xmath85 and comparison with predictions of pinson s formula . the small deviations are presumably due to finite - size effects which should disappear when larger systems are measured and an extrapolation is made to infinity , as we have verified for @xmath110 .",
    "note that @xmath111 is at a local and apparently global maximum of pinson s formula , although again by equations ( [ eq : reflection]-[eq : inverse ] ) an infinite number of other points on the @xmath112 plane have the identical value of @xmath102 , such as @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "a plot of pinson s formula as a function of @xmath57 for different @xmath30 shows that for small @xmath30 it begins to develop oscillations .",
    "this is because of the tendency to create spiral rather than cross configurations for small aspect ratios .",
    "in @xcite , it was suggested that @xmath21 relates to the number of  spanning \" clusters , since these are essentially the cause of the excess .",
    "however , hu @xcite has shown that they are not numerically identical , using one particular definition of spanning . here",
    "we elaborate on this point .",
    "we consider large systems with periodic b.  c.  and ask for the number of clusters nr@xmath115 whose maximum dimension @xmath116 in the @xmath56 or @xmath117 direction exceeds some value @xmath118 . since @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the fractal dimension and @xmath121 , it follows that nr@xmath122 or @xmath123 in 2d .",
    "we have measured this quantity for square @xmath124 and rectangular @xmath125 systems for various sizes , and find that for an intermediate range in @xmath118 the expected universal @xmath123 behavior is followed : @xmath126 where @xmath127 ( square ) or @xmath128 ( rectangular system ) and @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath130 is a universal measure of the size distribution , dependent only upon the rule of what constitutes the length scale @xmath118 .",
    "( one could just as well use maximum diameter , radius of gyration , etc .",
    ", each of which would lead to a different @xmath130 .",
    "thus @xmath130 too is a  shape \"-",
    "dependent universal quantity . )",
    "( [ eq : nr ] ) implies that @xmath130 is just the density in an infinite system of clusters of minimum dimension @xmath118 , on the length scale of @xmath118 .",
    "it is the universal analog of @xmath9 .",
    "the data for nr@xmath115 deviates from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nr ] ) at both the large and small size limits . for small @xmath118 ,",
    "the deviation is due to lattice - level effects ; at the limit @xmath131 , nr@xmath132 is just @xmath133 , which is clearly non - universal . for @xmath118 near the maximum , the deviation is due to the influence of the boundary and is related to the value of @xmath21 .    according to our definition , @xmath134 ( the actual number of clusters ) @xmath135 ( the expected number of clusters using the bulk density ) .",
    "therefore , using a lower length scale of @xmath118 that is in the scaling region , we have @xmath136 evidently , in using this formula , @xmath118 can be taken right up to the minimum dimension of the system , @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the number in each size range , @xmath137 @xmath138 follows @xmath139 within @xmath140 right up to @xmath141 .",
    "this implies that @xmath21 can be found by applying ( [ eq : b3 ] ) with @xmath141 . using the numerical data for nr@xmath142 for @xmath95 and @xmath143",
    ", we find from ( [ eq : b3 ] ) @xmath144 compared with the actual vales 0.884 and 0.991 respectively .",
    "the small shortfall may be due to the need to take @xmath118 somewhat smaller than @xmath1 in ( [ eq : b3 ] ) , or to statistical errors .",
    "we are investigating this point further .",
    "thus , we have the meaning of @xmath21 ( taking @xmath145 : the number of clusters in a system of area @xmath146 whose extent is larger than the minimum system dimension @xmath1 , minus the expected number predicted by the bulk density , @xmath147 .",
    "we have numerically demonstrated the universality of @xmath62 on both the sq and tr lattices .",
    "we have shown that @xmath21 is related to the average number of clusters of length scale greater or equal to @xmath1 , if one subtracts off the contribution of the universal size distribution characterized by the universal constant @xmath130 .",
    "it appears that @xmath148 follows a universal behavior close to , and perhaps right up to @xmath141 . on a finite system with periodic b.  c. , the probability of growing a cluster of a certain size is identical to its probability on an infinite system , as long as the cluster is small enough that it does nt touch itself after wrapping around the boundaries .",
    "this result , however , says that the _ number _ of clusters of a certain size range is also substantially unaffected by the system finiteness , even though the boundaries should , it seems , influence the statistics of such clusters when their combined size is large enough that they touch when wrapping around the boundary .",
    "further work needs to be done to understand this behavior .    the tr lattice constructed as in fig .",
    "1b gives extremal values of @xmath21 and @xmath102 and may in fact be the best periodic system to use for many percolation problems ( as well as other types of lattice simulations ) .",
    "this is because , when the @xmath149 @xmath150 rhombus is used to tile the plane , it leads to a triangular array of repeated patterns which has the most space between each repeated element of any regular array .    while tori with  twists \" add a rich extra degree of freedom , they are by no means the only systems for which @xmath21 can be calculated .",
    "what is needed is a system that is effectively a closed surface .",
    "one can transform the rectangular basis of the torus to other shapes by conformal transformation , such as to an annulus , and then apply the transformed periodic b.  c. to the problem .",
    "( here , the curved boundaries suggest using a continuum form of percolation , as in @xcite ) .",
    "a simple closed surface like the surface of a sphere can also be used for the system .",
    "each of these systems will have its own characteristic value of @xmath21 and other shape - dependent universal quantities ."
