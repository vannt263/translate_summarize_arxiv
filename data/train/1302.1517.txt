    "while only a handful of directly - detected exoplanets is currently known , the near future should bring a statistically significant sample of directly - imaged exoplanets , thanks to a number of surveys underway or coming online soon .",
    "examples include vlt / sphere , gemini / gpi , subaru / hiciao , hale / p1640 @xcite . an important input for predicting the yields of such surveys and for interpreting their results is the cooling history of gas giant planets . in the traditional approach @xcite , objects begin their cooling , fully formed , with an arbitrarily high specific entropy and hence radius and luminosity . in the past ,",
    "the precise choice of initial conditions for the cooling has been of no practical consequence because only the 4.5-gyr - old solar system s gas giants were known , while high initial entropies are forgotten on the short kelvin ",
    "helmholtz time - scale @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , direct - detection surveys are aiming specifically at young ( @xmath6  myr ) systems , and the traditional models , as their authors explicitly recognised , are not reliable at early ages .    using the standard core - accretion formation model @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) found that newly - formed gas giants produced by core accretion should be substantially colder than what the usual cooling tracks that begin with arbitrarily hot initial conditions assume .",
    "these outcomes are known as ` cold start ' and ` hot start ' , respectively .",
    "however noted that there are a number of assumptions and approximations that go into the core accretion models that make the predicted entropy uncertain .",
    "in particular , the accretion shock at the surface of the planet is suspected to play a key role as most of the mass is processed through it (;",
    "@xcite ) but there does not yet exist a satisfactory treatment of it .",
    "furthermore , there may also be an accretion shock in the other main formation scenario , gravitational instability , such that it too could yield planets cooler than usually expected ( see section  8 of * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , @xcite recently found that the initial entropy varies strongly with the mass of the core , leading nearly to warm starts for reasonable values of core masses in the framework of core accretion .",
    "the most reasonable viewpoint for now is therefore to consider that the initial entropy is highly uncertain and may lie almost anywhere between the cold values of and the hot starts .",
    "in fact , calculated ` warm start ' models that were intermediate between the cold and hot starts , and recently , @xcite calculated cooling tracks and spectra of giant planets beginning with a range of initial entropies .",
    "this uncertainty in the initial entropy means that observations are in a privileged position to inform models of planet formation , for which the entropy ( or luminosity ) at the end of the accretion phase is an easily accessible output .",
    "its determination both on an individual basis as well as for a statistically meaningful sample of planets would be very valuable , with the latter allowing quantitative comparisons to planet population synthesis @xcite . moreover , upcoming and ongoing surveys should bring , in a near future , both qualitative and quantitative changes to the collection of observed planets to reveal a number of light objects at moderate separations from their parent star ( i.e.  jupiter - like planets ) , which contrasts with the few currently known direct detections . _ with this in mind , we stress the importance of interpreting direct observations in a model - independent fashion _ and of thinking about the information that these yield about the initial ( i.e.  post - formation ) conditions of gas giants .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the constraints on the mass @xmath7 and initial , post - formation entropy @xmath0 that come from a luminosity and age determination for a directly - detected object , focusing on exoplanets . since the current luminosity increases monotonically both with mass and initial entropy , these constraints take the form of a ` trade - off curve ' between @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "we show that , in the planetary regime , the allowed values of @xmath7 and @xmath0 can be divided into two regions .",
    "the first is a hot - start region where the initial entropy can be arbitrarily high but where the mass is essentially unique .",
    "this corresponds to the usual mass determination by fitting hot - start cooling curves .",
    "the second corresponds to solutions with a lower entropy in a narrow range and for which the planet mass has to be larger than the hot - start mass .",
    "( a priori , this may even reach into the mass regime where deuterium burning is important , which is discussed in a forthcoming paper . )",
    "the degeneracy between mass and initial entropy means that in general the mass and entropy can not be constrained independently from a measurement of luminosity alone .",
    "when additional mass information is available , for example for multiple - planet systems or systems with radial velocity , it is possible to constrain the formation entropy more tightly .",
    "we start in section  [ sec : struct+cool ] by describing our gas - giant cooling models , discussing the luminosity scalings with mass and entropy , and comparing to previous calculations in the literature . in section",
    "[ sec : genconstr ] , we show in general how to derive constraints on the mass and initial entropy of a directly - detected exoplanet by comparing its measured luminosity and age to cooling curves with a range of initial entropies .",
    "we briefly consider in section  [ sec : gtconstr ] similar constraints based on a ( spectral ) determination of the effective temperature and surface gravity . after a brief discussion of the luminosity  age diagram of directly - detected objects ,",
    "we apply the procedure based on bolometric luminosities in section  [ sec : obsobj ] to three particularly interesting systems  2m1207 , hr  8799 , and @xmath3  pictoris  and derive lower bounds on the initial entropies of the companions .",
    "for hr  8799 and @xmath3  pic , we use the available information on the masses to constrain the initial entropies more tightly .",
    "finally , we offer a summary and concluding remarks in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "given its importance in the initial stages of a planet s cooling , we focus in this paper on the internal entropy of a gas giant as a fundamental parameter which , along with its mass , determines its structure and controls its evolution .",
    "very few authors have explicitly considered entropy as the second fundamental quantity even though this approach is more transparent than the usual , more intuitive use of time as the second independent variable . in this section , before comparing our models to standard ones , we discuss interior temperature  pressure profiles and semi - analytically explain the different scalings of luminosity on mass and entropy which appear in the models .",
    "we calculate the evolution of cooling gas giants by a ` following the adiabats ' approach @xcite .",
    "we generate a large grid of planet models with ranges of interior specific entropy @xmath8 and mass @xmath7 and determine for each model the luminosity @xmath9 at the top of the convection zone .",
    "we then use it to calculate the rate of change of the convective zone s entropy @xmath10 , which is defined by writing the entropy equation @xmath11 as @xmath12 with @xmath13 the luminosity due to deuterium burning in the convection zone . with the current @xmath8 and @xmath10 in hand ,",
    "calculating a cooling curve becomes a simple matter of stepping through the grid of models at a fixed mass .",
    "this is computationally expeditious and gives results nearly identical to the usual procedure based on the energy equation @xcite , as discussed in section  [ sec : modelcomp ] .",
    "the assumptions in the ` following the adiabats ' approach are that @xmath14 is constant throughout the convective zone and that no luminosity is generated in the atmosphere .",
    "for these to hold , we require both the thermal time - scale @xmath15 @xcite  where @xmath16 is the specific heat capacity , @xmath17 the gravity , and @xmath18 the local flux  in the radiative zone overlying the convective core and the convective turnover time - scale to be much shorter than the time - scale on which the entropy is changing , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the mass - weighted mean temperature in the convection zone .",
    "a similar approach was used to study the evolution of ohmically - heated irradiated gas giants by @xcite .",
    "we do not include deuterium burning directly in the planet models since it always occurs inside the convection zone .",
    "instead , we calculate the deuterium burning luminosity per unit deuterium mass fraction for each model in the grid and use it in equation ( [ eq : l ] ) to follow the cooling of the planet and the time evolution of the deuterium mass fraction averaged over the convective region . however , we focus in this work on masses below the ( parameter - dependent ) deuterium - burning limit near @xmath2114  @xmath22 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , such that deuterium burning does not play a role in the objects evolution .",
    "we defer a detailed exploration of deuterium burning in our models to an ulterior publication but already mention the interesting result that cooling curves starting at low entropy can exhibit an initial increase in their luminosity due to deuterium burning .",
    "we subsequently noticed that the colder starts in fig .",
    "8 of @xcite show a similar behaviour , and that @xcite also find in their formation simulations the possibility of deuterium ` flashes ' .      to construct a model with a given mass @xmath7 and internal entropy @xmath8 ,",
    "we integrate inwards from the photosphere and outwards from the centre , adjusting the central pressure , the cooling time @xmath23 , and the luminosity @xmath24 and the radius @xmath25 at the top of the inner zone until the two integrations match at a pressure of 30  kbar .",
    "we use the eddington approximation at the photosphere , setting @xmath26 at @xmath27 , and take the solar - metallicity ( based on * ? ? ?",

    "helium mixture is that of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) with a helium mass fraction @xmath28 .",
    "since we focus on gas giants , we do not include a rocky core , which was found in a test grid to increase the luminosities by at most a few per cent at the lower masses , as in @xcite .",
    "the grid has a lower entropy limit of @xmath29@xmath30 per baryon ( i.e.  per mass of hydrogen atom ) . for comparison ,",
    "4.5-gyr - old jupiter has a current entropy of @xmath31 ( @xcite , but see appendix  [ sec : sdiff ] ) . ] .",
    "the upper @xmath8 limit in the grid is set by the requirement that @xmath32 , a value found to make numerical convergence straightforward .",
    "the upper limits are @xmath33 near 1  @xmath22 and @xmath34 for the higher masses .",
    "[ fig : jupcomp ] shows interior profiles in the @xmath35@xmath36 plane for a range of entropies and masses .",
    "schematically , since hydrostatic balance dictates @xmath37 , increasing the mass at a fixed entropy extends the centre to a higher pressure along the adiabat .",
    "this is exacerbated at high entropies , where the planet substantially shrinks with increasing mass , while low - entropy objects have a roughly constant radius .",
    "( radii as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are presented in appendix  [ app : r ] . ) at fixed mass , increasing the entropy mostly shifts the centre to higher @xmath35 or to lower @xmath36 .",

    "increasing the entropy partially lifts the degeneracy since the degeneracy parameter @xmath41 is a monotonic function of @xmath8 , and @xmath42 remains constant because of the constant radius . at entropies higher than a turn - over value of @xmath43 ,",
    "the central temperature does not increase ( and even decreases ) with entropy .",

    "this second convection zone , which is at most at an entropy 0.2  @xmath1 higher than the convective core , will not affect the evolution of the object since the radiative thermal time - scale is much shorter than the cooling time @xmath23 throughout the atmosphere .",

    "planets with a second convective zone can equivalently be thought of as having a radiative shell interrupting their convective zone , as originally predicted for jupiter s adiabat by @xcite based on too low opacities ( see e.g.  the brief review in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that the higher - entropy objects ( @xmath58 , with some dependence on mass ) are convective from the centre all the way to the photosphere .      to provide a model - independent way of thinking about an object s brightness and thus to facilitate comparison with other models , we show in fig .",

    ", we firstly note that the radiative luminosity at the radiative - convective boundary , which is equal to the total luminosity , can always be written as @xcite @xmath67 approximating the convection zone to contain the whole mass ( cf .  the 99-per - cent mass labels in fig .",

    "[ fig : jupcomp ] reveals that the opacity at the radiative - convective boundary @xmath72 remains constant at a given mass , which provides a first relation .",
    "secondly , over the temperature and pressure range of interest in this regime , the hydrogen and helium remain respectively molecular and neutral .",
    "this implies that @xmath71 is constant and that the entropy has a simple functional form in the ideal - gas approximation , given by the sackur  tetrode expression ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "finally , @xmath70 is approximately fitted by @xmath83 . combining the four relations ( constant @xmath71 and the three non - trivial ones ) with equation ( [ eq : lrcb ] ) yields @xmath84",
    "this is quite close to a power - law fit of fig .",

    "the solution is a @xmath106 relation , which yields the radiative gradient @xmath107 along it .",
    "the important point is that both the atmosphere profile and its gradient depend only on the quantity @xmath73 .",

    "therefore , there is a unique @xmath73 associated with an @xmath8 , which means that @xmath24 must be of the form to the irradiation temperature , so that @xmath101 at the rcb is automatically a function of only one thermodynamic variable , for instance @xmath8 , for all entropies . ] @xmath110 .",
    "since we determine convective instability through the schwarzschild criterion @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is relatively constant and the radiative gradient is given by @xmath113 near the surface , a slow inward increase of @xmath114 will ensure a deep rcb .",
    "consequently , the @xmath115 scaling will hold for those @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that , starting at the photosphere with @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the opacity increases only slowly along the adiabats .",

    "this in turn means that the atmosphere can reach the radiative - zero solution , which we have shown necessarily implies @xmath99 . for the conditions found in the atmospheres of planets with high and low entropy , however , opacity increases relatively quickly along an adiabat .",
    "since the @xmath106 slope in the atmosphere is not too different from that of the convective zone s adiabat , this means that opacity increases rapidly in the atmosphere , which therefore can not join on to the radiative - zero solution before becoming convective .",

    "the different @xmath68 scalings then reflect in part the approximate temperature- and pressure-_in_dependence of the opacity at low and high @xmath8 , respectively , and the fact that opacity increases relatively little along adiabats at intermediate @xmath8 .",

    "the interpretation of this fact is not obvious given that the data points forming the lower envelope come from multiple surveys and that different observational biases apply at different ages ( e.g.  due to the relatively low number of young objects in the solar neighbourhood ) .",
    "the second feature is the absence of detections between the hot - start 10- and 15-@xmath22 cooling curves , roughly between 20 and 100  myr .",
    "more accurately , there is , in a given age bin in that range , a lower density of data points with luminosities around 10@xmath324 than at higher or lower luminosities .",
    "a proper assesment of the statistical significance of this ` gap ' in the data points would require taking both the smallness of the number of detections around 40  myr and the biases and non - detections of the various surveys into account .",
    "however , it would not be surprising if the underdensity in the luminosity function @xmath325 of the data points , at a fixed age , proved to be real , since there is also a suggestive underdensity in the cooling curves .",
    "indeed , the onset of deuterium burning near 13.6  @xmath22 slows down the cooling , which breaks the hot - start scaling @xmath326 ( see section  [ sec : gencooling ] ) and leads to a greater distance between the hot - start cooling curves for 10 and 15  @xmath22 than for 5 and 10  @xmath22 .",
    "( this is clearly visible in fig .  1 of @xcite , which also shows that there is a similar gap for low - mass stars at 10@xmath324 and 110  gyr , due to the hydrogen main sequence . ) in particular , cooling tracks for objects of 15 , 20 , and 25  @xmath22 nearly overlap at @xmath327  myr around 10@xmath324 , where data points and their errorbars collect too .",
    "this tentative indication of an agreement between the detections and the cooling tracks suggests that the latter might be consistent with the data ) , which would need to be set accordingly finely to have the lightcurves pass through the data gap .",
    "the implicit assumptions here are that the observed distribution of masses is uniform in the approximate range 525  @xmath22 ( as are the mass values chosen for fig .",

    "the former can not currently be validated but the latter seems reasonable , as the entropy interval over which cooling curves change from going above to below the gap is very narrow . ] .",
    "it will therefore be interesting to see how significant the ` gap ' is and how it evolves as data points are added to this diagram .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : neuhaeuser ] , the best - fitting age is calculated as the geometric mean of the reported upper and lower bounds since , in most cases , no best - fitting value is provided , and the bounds are typically estimates from different methods , which can not be easily combined . in fact , the ages of young ( @xmath328  myr ) stars are in general a challenge to determine , as @xcite reviews , and represent the main uncertainty in direct observations .",
    "moreover , as @xcite point out , assuming co - evality of the companion and its primary may be problematic for the youngest objects . indeed , a formation time - scale of @xmath32910  myr in the core - accretion scenario would mean that some data points of fig .",

    "in contrast , when a range of initial entropies are considered ( ` cold starts ' or ` warm starts ' ) , the hot - start mass is in fact only a lower limit on the planet mass : larger - mass planets with lower initial entropies can also reproduce a given observed luminosity and age .",
    "[ fig : msplotnod ] shows the allowed values of mass and entropy for different ages and luminosities , and can be used to quickly obtain estimates of mass and initial entropy for any given system .    to derive these constraints",

    "once the assumption of hot initial conditions is removed , however , a more convenient variable is the entropy of the planet .",

    "a noteworthy result is that in the intermediate - entropy regime ( @xmath397@xmath398 ) , where the outer radiative zone is thick and follows a radiative - zero solution , the luminosity obeys @xmath399 as found for irradiated gas giants by @xcite , with @xmath100 a steeply increasing function of the entropy .",
    "we also note that constraints obtained for models with a particular helium mass fraction @xmath177 can be easily translated to another @xmath177 with equation ( [ eq : s s ] ) as it provides an approximate value for @xmath185 at constant @xmath24 .",

    "we find that our models are in good agreement ( within tens of per cent ) with the hot - start models of @xcite and @xcite , as well as the cold - start models of @xcite , and cooling models calculated with the mesa stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "we caution that the @xcite and @xcite models , for example , use a version of the @xcite equation of state whose entropy is offset by a constant @xmath400 from the published tables ( which the present work uses ) ; this difference is not significant physically but needs to be taken into account when comparing results of various groups .",
    "details and @xmath401 points for a quick comparison are provided in appendix  [ sec : sdiff ] . the remaining intrinsic difference in entropy between our models and those just cited",
    "is then approximately @xmath402 at worse .",
    "this is more important than differences in opacities or composition ; for example , we estimate from @xcite that the uncertainty in the helium ( @xmath177 ) and metal ( @xmath403 ) mass fractions introduces variations of at most 10 per cent in the luminosity at a given age .",
    "we stress again that when the initial entropy is allowed to take a range of values , the hot - start mass ( equation ( [ eq : mhs ] ) ) is only a lower limit on the companion mass",
    ". the larger range of allowed masses means that the hot - start mass could actually lead to the mischaracterization of an object , with a hot - start mass in the planetary regime actually corresponding to an object with a mass above the deuterium - burning limit for low enough entropies .",
    "one way to break the degeneracy between mass and entropy is an accurate determination of the radius from spectral fitting ( or actually a determination of @xmath289 and @xmath244 from the spectrum ) , which would yield the mass and ( current ) entropy of the object without any degeneracy ( see e.g.  fig .  [",
    "fig : msloggt_eg ] ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : gtconstr ] , however , current atmosphere models have significant uncertainties that make this approach difficult .",
    "another possibility is to obtain independent constraints on the mass of a companion , for example from dynamical considerations .    in section  [ sec : obsobj ]",
    ", we applied our models to three directly - imaged objects which have hot - start masses in the planetary - mass regime and for some of which there are additional constraints on the planet mass .",
    "we find that the initial entropy of 2m1207  b is at least 9.2  @xmath1 , assuming that it does not burn deuterium . for the planets of the hr  8799 system",
    ", we infer that they must have formed with @xmath2 , independent of the age uncertainties for the star .",
    "finally , a similar analysis for @xmath3  pic  b reveals that it must have formed with @xmath4 , using the radial - velocity mass upper limit of 12  @xmath22 .",
    "these initial entropy values are respectively ca .  0.7 , 0.5 , and 1.5  @xmath1 higher than the ones obtained from core accretion models by @xcite .",
    "this quantitatively rules out the coldest starts for these objects and constrains warm starts , especially for @xmath3  pic  b.    an important point is that the uncertainties in age and luminosity impact the derived hot - start mass and the lower bound on initial entropy in different ways . the major uncertainty in direct detections is the age of the star and , relevant for very young systems , all the more that of the planet .",
    "this age uncertainty translates into errorbars for the hot - start mass which are @xmath266 .",
    "however , the uncertainty on the initial entropy on the mass - independent branch of the @xmath280 curve is due only to that in the bolometric luminosity , with @xmath404 where @xmath405 when @xmath406 ( or , less accurately , when @xmath407@xmath63 ) .",
    "this uncertainty @xmath408 is typically very small , which means that , up to systematic errors , the initial entropy can be determined quite accurately .",
    "it has been pointed out before that current direct - imaging detections are all inconsistent with the cold - start predictions from core - accretion models .",
    "it is important to stress however that the cold starts are in some sense an extreme case , as they assume complete radiation efficiency at the shock during runaway accretion , which is argued to set the low initial entropy of planet . by varying the nebula temperature or the accretion rate ,",
    "@xcite were able to change the entropy by barely @xmath409 ; however , @xcite and @xcite report that it is possible within the core - accretion scenario to obtain considerably higher entropies , increased by as much as 12  @xmath1 , when considering different masses for the solid core ( through a self - amplifying process explained in @xcite ) . with @xmath3",
    "pic  b a likely candidate for formation by core accretion , this indicates that it is essential to gain a deeper understanding about what sets the initial entropy , for instance by looking in more detail at the properties of the shock during runaway accretion .    the derived bounds on @xmath0 for the hr  8799 objects and @xmath3  pic  b made use of information on the mass , which comes from dynamical stability analyses and radial velocity , respectively .",
    "radial - velocity data of directly - detected planets are currently available only for @xmath3  pic  b , but this should change in a near future as close - in planets start being detected directly . in the absence of dynamical information ,",
    "an upper limit to the mass ( and thus a lower limit on the initial entropy ) should be obtainable from @xmath289 , even if its errorbars are large ; thus , in practice , the @xmath280 constraint curve does not extend to arbitrarily high masses as a pure luminosity measurement would imply .    finally , we ran markov - chain monte carlo simulations to derive more detailed quantitative constraints on the mass and entropy of directly - detected objects . when taking the uncertainties in the age and luminosity into account , we considered normal , lognormal , and flat distributions and found the chosen form to make little difference .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it allows one to derive posterior distributions on the initial entropy , which are suitable for statistical comparisons .",
    "given the small semi - major axis of @xmath3  pic  b ( 9  au ) , we also tried a prior @xmath410 ( which describes the population of radial - velocity planets ) in addition to a flat prior on @xmath7 .",
    "the latter case yielded posterior distributions on @xmath0 with a more pronounced peak .",
    "the benefits that the expected large increase in the number of directly - detected exoplanets in the near future should bring are at least twofold .",
    "firstly , each new detection will yield a new constraint on the initial entropy and therefore formation mechanism . particularly with the ability to detect lower mass gas giants at small semi - major axes ( @xmath411  au ) , which should be possible with instruments such as gpi or sphere",
    ", there will be an opportunity to constrain the state of the gas giant immediately following core accretion .",
    "secondly , with a larger sample of objects comes a chance for a statistical comparison with formation models .",
    "for example , as noted in section  [ sec : ddo ] , the onset of deuterium burning leads to a relative underdensity of planets with luminosities @xmath412 and ages of tens of myr ( assuming that the masses of substellar objects are smoothly distributed near the deuterium - burning limit ) .",
    "indeed , it is interesting that there appears to be such an underdensity in the current data sample ( see fig .",
    "8) , although the small number of detections so far means that this could be due to a statistical fluctuation . the best constraints on initial conditions for planet cooling will come from improved spectral models that can give reliable determinations of @xmath289 and @xmath244",

    "therefore , we shall assume that the estimates of the surface gravity imply a mass below the deuterium - burning limit , near 13  @xmath22 ( @xcite ; marleau & cumming , in prep . ) .",
    "several properties of hr  8799 let its age be estimated : variability from non - radial oscillations , low abundance of iron - peak elements , and far - ir excess due to circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "along with its galactic space motion and position in a hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram , these lead @xcite to estimate an age range of 30160  myr with a preferred value of 60  myr , consistent with the 20150  myr range of @xcite based on membership in the local association .",
    "recently , @xcite used interferometric measurements of hr  8799 s radius to derive a stellar mass and age .",
    "they found best - fitting ages of 33 or 90  myr , depending on whether the star is approaching or moving away from the main sequence .",
    "however , the statistical errorbars , which do not take uncertainties in the stellar models into account , are considerable in the second case ( the 1-@xmath299 ranges are 2040 and 40471  myr , respectively ) . nevertheless ,",
    "if @xcite s measurement of the stellar radius and the deduced metallicity are correct , the age range of 1.11.6  gyr from the asteroseismological analysis of @xcite would be compromised , as @xcite point out .",
    "indeed , they estimate a near - solar metallicity , which contrasts with the @xmath249\\simeq-0.3 $ ] or @xmath474 result of @xcite , while metallicity is an important input of asteroseismological analyses .",
    "moreover , there is the statistical argument put forth by @xcite that massive discs ( such as hr  8799 s of 0.1  @xmath475 ; @xcite ) are unlikely to be found around older stars . in our analysis",
    ", we shall therefore ignore the 1.1  gyr result and instead use 20 and 160  myr as lower and upper limits , which brackets the ranges reviewed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated luminosities of @xmath349 ( hr  8799  b ) , @xmath350 ( cd ) and @xmath351 ( e ) from the known distance of @xmath476  pc and six infrared magnitudes , covering @xmath477 per cent of the bolometric luminosity , and also from bolometric corrections for brown dwarfs . for their part ,",
    "@xcite recently derived luminosities of @xmath478 , @xmath479 , and @xmath480 for planets b , c , and d , respectively , by self - consistently obtaining the radius from evolutionary models .",
    "this contrasts with the usual procedure of optimising @xmath481 along with @xmath244 and @xmath289 to fit the photometry , which yields unphysically small radii of @xmath482 @xcite .",
    "similarly , in a recent study using `` atmospheric retrieval '' ( non - parametric determination of the @xmath36@xmath35 and composition structure ) including a simple cloud model , @xcite also find for hr  8799  b a small radius of @xmath483 , which implies with their @xmath484  k and @xmath485   a bolometric luminosity @xmath486 . since @xcite considered only hot starts , i.e.  fixed @xmath487 , the cooling tracks are @xmath488 and @xmath489 relations , which let @xmath25 and @xmath340 be uniquely determined from @xmath289 and @xmath244 .",
    "this gives an age of 360  myr for hr  8799  b and age ranges of 40100  myr and 30100  myr for c and d , consistent with other literature estimates .",
    "given the difficulties in obtaining a reasonable fit , @xcite warn that the first result should not be taken seriously , and note that the tension in the age would be reduced by considering colder initial conditions . in our analysis ,",
    "the luminosity values of @xcite will be used since they are standard and almost or marginally consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "finally , an age of 30 or 60  myr for the system leads @xcite to derive from the luminosity and the cooling tracks of @xcite masses of @xmath490 or @xmath491 .",
    "the uncertainty in the age implies ( see section  [ sec : genconstr ] ) @xmath4921.3  @xmath22 for the hot - start values .",
    "since it is to date the only directly - imaged multiple - planet system , hr  8799 has received a considerable amount of attention with regard to its dynamical stability ( e.g.  @xcite ; see reviews in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , only the most recent studies were able to consider all four planets .",
    "crucial questions include whether there are two- or three - planet mean - motion resonances ( mmrs ; as @xcite and @xcite suggest ) , what the inclination and eccentricities of the orbits are ( for instance , @xcite estimated 13@xmath493 for the inclination of hr  8799  b with respect to the plane of the sky ) and whether they are co - planar ( against which @xcite recently provided evidence , while @xcite argues in favour ) , and , naturally , what the masses ( including that of the star ) are and how long the system should be required to survive .",
    "solutions are very sensitive to these parameters and even to the numerical integrator used , as @xcite note . the parameter space s high dimensionality makes a proper exploration  ",
    "i.e.  without artificially - imposed restrictions as all authors had to assume   , computationally prohibitive , and trying to include information about the disc would only make matters worse .",
    "stability is estimated by using astrometric constraints and numerically evolving the system over time , requiring that it be stable ( without collisions nor ejections ) for a period equal to its age .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite point out that if it is young with respect to its main - sequence lifetime , hr  8799 could indeed be a transient system undergoing dynamical relaxation .",
    "therefore , it may not be possible to draw firm conclusions even from the results of a complete analysis .",
    "nevertheless , if the direction in which these studies point is correct , the planets should have as low masses as allowed , with however somewhat higher masses permitted if some orbits are resonant .",
    "for this reason , we shall consider as approximate upper limits from stability analyses ( bcde ) .",
    "using these values instead would barely change our derived minimum bounds on @xmath0 , lowering some by @xmath494 . ]",
    "masses of 7 , 10 , 10 , and 10  @xmath22 ( bcde ) . in particular ,",
    "as @xcite also find , it seems very likely that none is a deuterium - burning object .        the namesake a5 dwarf of the nearby ( 973  pc ; @xcite ) @xmath3  pictoris moving group has an age of @xmath373  myr @xcite and asymmetric outer and warped inner discs , which have been observed for more than two decades ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see review in @xcite ) .",
    "a companion was first detected in @xmath312 @xcite and subsequently confirmed at 4  @xmath240 m @xcite and in @xmath447 @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite added to these observations photometry in @xmath445 , @xmath446 , and @xmath495 .",
    "the distance of @xmath496  pc  pc @xcite . ] to @xmath3  pic  b implies an orbital separation of 89  au @xcite , which is the smallest of all low - mass directly - detected objects .",
    "an object at this position had been predicted from the disc morphology by @xcite .",
    "until recently @xcite , the only bolometric luminosity estimate for @xmath3  pic  b was due to @xcite , who report @xmath497 .",
    "they firstly derived , from the @xmath498  k of @xcite , a spectral type @xmath499t4 using the @xmath244spt relation of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .",
    "they then estimated from their spt ",
    "bc@xmath452 curve a bolometric correction bc@xmath500 ( t.  schmidt 2012 , priv .",
    "thus , the large , asymmetric lower errorbar on the luminosity comes from the large , asymmetric lower errorbar on the bolometric correction , which itself is due to the flat @xmath244spt relation between l7 and t4 in . a more direct approach to the bolometric luminosity",
    "consists of converting the colour to a spectral type and obtaining from this a bolometric correction . also using the fits only begin appearing later than @xmath501 , whereas the spt we consider for @xmath3  pic  b is l1t0 ( @xcite ; cf .",

    ", this gives the same luminosity as found by @xcite but with a smaller lower errorbar of @xmath503  dex .",
    "one should however note that @xmath504 is not a monotonic function , so that the errorbars are strongly non - gauian . with a maximum @xmath505 of 3.3  mag near l3.5 , @xmath506 can not formally be above @xmath507  dex . however , the bc@xmath452spt relation of was derived for field dwarfs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the spectral classification of young objects is not yet well understood nor , in fact , well defined ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "keeping in mind these uncertainties in interpreting the photometry , we shall use for the analysis @xmath375 , where the upper errorbar reflects the residuals of the fit .",
    "this is at some variance with the value of @xmath508 of @xcite but compares favourably with @xmath509 from @xcite .",
    "the object @xmath3  pic  b is particularly interesting because it is the first directly - imaged companion for which radial - velocity data are also available @xcite .",
    "using new and archival data spanning eight years and thanks to the high inclination of the system ( @xmath510 ; @xcite ) , @xcite were able to place tentative lower mass limits of 12@xmath286 , which is fully consistent with all reasonable age and luminosity combinations , even allowing for very large lower errorbars on the latter .",
    "@xcite s upper limit of 10@xmath511 , with @xmath512 for the most probable orbit of 9  au @xcite is an important result which excludes high - mass solutions and puts the object quite likely in the planetary ( non - deuterium burning ) range .",
    "we conclude with a brief digression . to the rarity of objects",
    "observable simultaneously in radial velocity ( rv ) and in direct imaging contribute both intrinsic detection biases  direct imaging favours planets further out from their star , resulting in a small rv signal  as well as selection biases  target stars are usually chosen based on the presence of a disc , which implies that the systems are preferentially seen face - on .",
    "a further hindrance is that young stars  young systems being of greater interest because of a smaller brightness contrast  are usually active and thus less amenable to radial - velocity measurements .",
