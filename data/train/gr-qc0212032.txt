    "a third sample of observations of quasar absorption - line spectra has been found to be consistent with a time variation in the value of the fine structure constant between redshifts @xmath6 and the present .",

    "they also allow us to investigate whether or not other cosmological observations are consistent with the small variations in @xmath1 that are required to fit the quasar observations .",
    "other theories , founded explicitly upon variation in the velocity of light , have also been proposed but their main interest is in connection with events in the very early universe @xcite and the problem of whether or not non - inflationary explanations for particular features of the large - scale structure of the universe are possible @xcite .",
    "others have begun to consider the implications for grand unification of coupling strengths , mar , poly , jdb , drink , banks , guts , cal , arm , chacko , correia , and astronomical probes of the constancy of the electron - proton mass ratio have reported possible evidence for time variation , @xcite , but as yet the statistical significance is low .",
    "barrow , sandvik , and magueijo @xcite have shown that bsbm theories have a number of appealing properties .",
    "they predict that there should be no variation of @xmath1 during the radiation era in our universe and none during any present or late - time curvature or cosmological constant dominated era . during",
    "the dust era @xmath1 should grow ( leading to @xmath10 as observed ) but only as @xmath11this behaviour allows the quasar data to be accommodated without producing conflict with recent geonuclear limits on allowed variations of @xmath1 , like the oklo natural reactor limits of @xmath12 @xcite because they are imposed at a very low effective redshift of @xmath13 at which time the universe has begun accelerating and all variations in @xmath1 are damped out .",
    "recent deductions of a possible upper limit of @xmath14 at @xmath15 from nuclear @xmath16 decays are potentially more restrictive @xcite .",

    "this result is a product of the assumption that on small scales the universe can be considered as being filled by an homogeneous and isotropic fluid , however we know this is not true below the scale where gravitational clustering becomes non - linear . on these small scales",
    "we also have to worry about new consequences of inhomogeneity which have not been included in our analysis .",

    "hence , we expect @xmath212 to be significantly scale dependent as we go to small scales",
    ". this behaviour will be investigated elsewhere along with the problem of the clustering of inhomogeneities in @xmath213 and @xmath1 .      in an era of accelerated expansion , @xmath214 , as would arise during inflation or during a @xmath4- or quintessence - dominated epoch at late times , we can consider the scale factor to evolve as a power - law of the conformal time as @xmath215 , where @xmath216 and @xmath33  runs from @xmath217 to @xmath25 .",
    "the case of @xmath218 corresponds to a @xmath4-dominated epoch .    as in the previous sections",
    ", we will assume that all the other matter components which fill the universe will behave exactly as in a perturbed frw universe with no variations in @xmath1 .",
    "we also assume that neither of the dust and radiation perturbations will affect the behaviour and evolution of @xmath219 , and that these perturbations are negligible with respect to the @xmath4 stress driving the expansion , so we will consider @xmath220 and @xmath188 .",
    "it was found in @xcite and @xcite that in universe which is undergoing accelerated expansion , the asymptotic solution for @xmath87 is a constant , so we will assume that @xmath221 , in the background , where @xmath222 is a constant .",

    "perturbations in @xmath1 are even less significant than in the radiation case .",
    "we note that the fact that the linear regime is a very good approximation at early times , since as can be seen from figure dustdeltaalpha , @xmath0 tracks @xmath264 at early times . from the detail of figure [ dustdeltaalpha ]",

    "we find that inhomogeneous perturbations in @xmath1 will decrease on large scales while on scales smaller than the hubble radius they will undergo bounded oscillations . in reality",
    ", we expect dissipation of the adiabatic fluctuations to occur by silk damping and small - scale fluctuations in @xmath1 will also undergo decay as their driving terms damp out .",

    "this result complements the earlier discovery @xcite , @xcite , that @xmath1 tends to a constant with exponential rapidity in friedmann universes that become dominated by a cosmological vacuum stress .",
    "any pre - existing inhomogeneities will be frozen in but their scale will be exponentially increased by the de sitter expansion .",
    "these perturbative results are quite good approximations when we consider large scales , but are expected to break down when extended to small scales , where non - linear effects come into play and local deviations from isotropy and homogeneity of the matter content are significant .",
    "we note that the background solutions for @xmath87 , about which we have linearised the perturbations of the einstein equations , are solutions which describe the time evolution of @xmath87 on a standard frw background .",
    "our neglect of the back - reaction of the @xmath87 perturbations on the background expansion dynamics is a good approximation up to logarithmic corrections .    when we examined the non - linear evolution of spherical inhomogeneities by means of a comparative numerical study of flat and closed friedmann models we found that perturbations in @xmath1 remain almost negligible with respect to perturbations in the fluid that dominates the energy density of the universe at the same epoch .",
    "comparing the flat with the closed solution for @xmath1 , we concluded that in both the cases of a radiation or dust - dominated epoch , @xmath1 will feel the change of behaviour in the scale factor , and the perturbations @xmath0 will grow in time .",
    "the early - time behaviour of the non - linear solutions confirms the linear behaviour found in section 4 . in particular@xmath270 changes in proportion to @xmath271 at early times .",
    "we have provided a detailed analysis of the behaviour of inhomogeneous perturbations in @xmath1 and its time variation on large scales under the assumption that the defining constant of the bsbm theory , @xmath212 , is constant and negative in sign . in reality",
    "this assumption will break down on small scales .",
    "the negativity of the effective value of @xmath212 requires that the cold dark matter is dominated by the magnetic rather than the electric field energy ( see also the discussion of ref @xcite and by bekenstein @xcite ) .",
    "however , on sufficiently small scales the dark matter will become dominated by baryons and the sign of the effective @xmath272 will have to change sign .",
    "overall , there will also be a gradient in the value of @xmath273 reflecting the scale dependence of the relative contribution of dark matter to the total density of the universe . we have not included these effects in the present analysis .",
    "they would need  to be included in any detailed analysis of the small - scale behaviour of inhomogeneities in @xmath5 this is an important challenge for future work because it would enable the quasar data on varying @xmath1 to be compared directly with the limits from the oklo natural reactor fuj , dd and rhenium - osmium abundances in meteorites @xcite . at present the relation between the cosmological and geonuclear evidences is unclear because the latter are derived from physical processes occurring within the cosmologically non - evolving solar system environment .",
    "variations in @xmath1 also affect the cosmic microwave background radiation spectrum and anisotropy in different ways , but the effects must be disentangled from allowed changes in other cosmological parameters that can contribute similar effects .",
    "these changes in the microwave background with @xmath23 left as a free constant parameter were analysed in @xcite using the new wmap data .",
    "they are far less sensitive that the many - multiplet analyses of quasars at @xmath274  @xcite , although they derive from higher redshifts , @xmath275 .",
