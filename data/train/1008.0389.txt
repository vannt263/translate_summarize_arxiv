    "our understanding of the physical properties of submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; see review by blain  @xcite ) is of key importance to studies of the early formation and evolution of massive galaxies , as they are the likely progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the present - day universe .",
    "smgs typically represent compact , intense ( @xmath91000yr@xmath10 ) , rather short - lived ( @xmath7100myr ) starbursts with rapid gas consumption through high star formation efficiencies that are commonly associated with ongoing major mergers .",
    "their star formation rates ( sfrs ) exceed those of ` normal ' high-@xmath1 galaxies with comparable stellar mass ( @xmath11 ) by more than an order of magnitude at @xmath1@xmath52 ( e.g. , daddi @xcite ) , making them a comparatively rare , but cosmologically important population .",
    "the extreme star formation events in smgs are typically associated with large amounts of gas and dust which often obscure the stellar light and star formation at rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) to optical wavelengths , making their identification at such wavelengths notoriously difficult .    the most insightful way to study smgs and their star formation properties",
    "thus usually is through the dust - reprocessed uv light from newly formed stars that is re - emitted in the far - infrared ( fir ) continuum ( a measure of the sfr ) , and through line emission from molecular gas ( typically co ) , the fuel for star fomation .",
    "molecular gas was detected in @xmath920 smgs to date , revealing large gas reservoirs of @xmath910@xmath12  in most cases ( see solomon & vanden bout @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recently , capak  ( @xcite ) discovered aztec-3 , an smg at an unprecedented redshift of @xmath1=5.3 .",
    "aztec-3 is not only the most distant smg known to date , but also resides in a massive , overdense , proto - cluster environment extending out to @xmath92mpc , with two companions within 12.2kpc .",
    "aztec-3 hosts a 1800yr@xmath10 starburst exhibiting a fir luminosity of @xmath13=(1.7@xmath140.8)@xmath310@xmath15  that likely produced a substantial fraction of its current stellar mass of @xmath11=(1.0@xmath140.2)@xmath310@xmath12 .",
    "the unusual nature of aztec-3 and its potential major implications for massive galaxy formation at very early cosmic epochs has initiated an in - depth study of its physical properties and cosmic environment .    in this letter , we report the detection of ,  and emission toward aztec-3 ( @xmath1=5.298 ) , using the expanded very large array ( evla ) and the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) .",
    "we use a concordance , flat @xmath16cdm cosmology throughout , with @xmath17=71mpc@xmath10 , @xmath18=0.27 , and @xmath19=0.73 ( spergel  @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "this corresponds to velocity - integrated emission line strengths of 0.23@xmath140.03 , 0.92@xmath140.09 , and 1.36@xmath140.19jy , i.e. , line luminosities of @xmath29=(5.84@xmath140.78 ) , @xmath30=(3.70@xmath140.37 ) , and @xmath31=(3.82@xmath140.54)@xmath310@xmath12 .",

    "within the size of the co beam , there are three galaxies with colors that are consistent with the co redshift of aztec-3 . by combining the integrated emission of the co @xmath21=5@xmath04 and 6@xmath05 lines detected at 12@xmath27 significance and fitting the @xmath34 data with a circular gaussian , we find that the source is unresolved down to a fwhm diameter of 1.0@xmath24@xmath140.7@xmath24 ( @xmath56@xmath144kpc at @xmath1=5.3 ) .",
    "this is consistent with a limit of 1.3@xmath24@xmath35 ( @xmath58@xmath36kpc ) as derived from the co @xmath21=2@xmath01 data .",
    "only one of the three color - selected galaxies falls within this smaller area , identifying the @xmath37@xmath526 galaxy targeted by the optical spectroscopy as the real counterpart of the co emission ( fig .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the  and combined co @xmath21=5@xmath04 & 6@xmath05 detections is 0.15@xmath24 and 0.12@xmath24 .",
    "the peak position of the co emission is consistent with that of the 890@xmath28 m continuum emission ( astrometric accuracy :  0.14@xmath24 ; younger @xcite ) and the 3.6@xmath28 m emission ( astrometric accuracy:0.2@xmath24 ; sanders  @xcite ) within the relative uncertainties ( fig .

    "interestingly , the emission at all these wavelengths is offset from the _",
    "@xmath37-band image of the source by @xmath50.5@xmath24 ( 3kpc ) , but is consistent with a marginal , much fainter peak in the rest - frame uv image ( which we interpret to be part of the same galaxy ; inset in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . given the 0.1@xmath24 relative astrometric accuracy of the _ hst _ data ,",
    "this offset is formally significant .",
    "we conclude that this offset is due to a combination of lacking surface brightness sensitivity and dust obscuration in the rest - frame uv image , a similar effect as seen in the @xmath1=4.055 smg gn20 ( e.g. , carilli @xcite ) .",
    "this effect also explains the substantial difference between the uv- and far - ir - derived star formation rates of aztec-3 ( capak @xcite ) , suggesting that the regions of most intense star formation are highly dust - obscured .      based on the co excitation ladder of aztec-3 , we can constrain the line radiative transfer through large velocity gradient ( lvg ) models , treating the gas kinetic temperature and density as free parameters . for all calculations , the h@xmath38 ortho  to  para ratio was fixed to 3:1 , the cosmic microwave background temperature was fixed to 17.16k ( at @xmath1=5.298 ) , and the flower ( @xcite ) co collision rates were used .",
    "we adopted a co abundance per velocity gradient of [ co]/(@xmath39()@xmath10 ( e.g. , wei  @xcite , @xcite ; riechers  @xcite ) .    the data are poorly fit by single - component models , which underpredict the  flux by @xmath530% .",
    "the data can be fitted reasonably well with two gas components , which are represented by a ` diffuse ' , low - excitation component with a kinetic temperature of @xmath40=30k and a gas density of @xmath41=10@xmath42@xmath43 , and a more ` dense ' , high - excitation component with @xmath44=45k and @xmath41=10@xmath45@xmath43 in our model ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . assuming that the molecular gas is distributed in a face - on , circular disk , the observed limits of 1.3@xmath24 and 1.0@xmath24 on the sizes of these low- and high - excitation gas components yield co disk filling factors of @xmath675% and @xmath610% .",
    "the ` diffuse ' gas component has physical properties comparable to those of nearby spiral galaxies and ` normal ' high-@xmath1 star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , dannerbauer @xcite ) , and contributes @xmath535% to the model - predicted  flux .",
    "the ` dense ' gas component has properties comparable to ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) nuclei and high-@xmath1 fir - luminous quasars ( e.g. , riechers et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , contributing @xmath565% to the  flux .",
    "the model suggests an excitation - corrected  line luminosity of @xmath46=6.6@xmath310@xmath12 , and @xmath13/@xmath46=260()@xmath10 .",
    "this luminosity ratio is comparable to ` typical ' @xmath1@xmath92 smgs and quasar host galaxies ( e.g. , greve  @xcite ; riechers @xcite ) .      given the gas excitation conditions in aztec-3 , we derive the total molecular gas mass based on a ulirg conversion factor of @xmath47=0.8()@xmath10 from @xmath46 to @xmath48 ( downes & solomon @xcite ) , yielding @xmath49=5.3@xmath310@xmath12.=3.5()@xmath10 for the low - excitation component would increase @xmath48 by a factor of 2.2 . ]",
    "this corresponds to 5.3@xmath3@xmath11 in this system , implying that the baryonic mass is dominated by the gaseous component .",
    "this means that the intense , 1800yr@xmath10 starburst in this galaxy has sufficient fuel to more than sextuple @xmath11 throughout the remainder of its duration .",
    "this also sets the gas depletion timescale @xmath50=@xmath48/sfr to 30myr , comparable to lower redshift smgs ( e.g. , greve @xcite ; schinnerer  @xcite ) and @xmath1@xmath94 quasar host galaxies ( e.g. , riechers @xcite ) .    adopting the size limit of 1.0@xmath24 ( @xmath56.2kpc ) , this also corresponds to a limiting average gas surface density of @xmath51@xmath61.7@xmath310@xmath52 .",
    "this is comparable to the values found for @xmath1@xmath62 smgs ( typically 2@xmath310@xmath52 ; tacconi  @xcite , @xcite ) , and about half of the peak gas density of the @xmath1=6.42 quasar j1148 + 5251 ( 3.5@xmath310@xmath52 ; riechers et al .",
    "assuming an intrinsic @xmath53 in this range ( i.e. , @xmath52.7@xmath310@xmath52 ) , this may indicate that the gas reservoir in aztec-3 has an intrinsic circular gas disk - equivalent radius of @xmath54@xmath52.5kpc .",
    "based on the velocity and size information extracted from the co data , we can determine a value for the dynamical mass ( @xmath55 ) of aztec-3 .",
    "given that the contributions from the central supermassive black hole ( @xmath56@xmath230.1% @xmath11 @xmath57 10@xmath58 ; alexander @xcite ) and dust ( @xmath59@xmath2312% @xmath49 ; e.g. , michalowski et al .",

    ", we can infer three main constraints on @xmath55 ( shaded regions in fig .",
    "first , the co observations place an upper limit of 1.3@xmath24 on @xmath54 .",
    "second , of the @xmath920 smgs detected in co emission to date , none has a fwhm linewidth of @xmath91200  ( median :  530 ; coppin @xcite ) .",
    "taking this as an upper limit on the intrinsic , inclination - corrected linewidth @xmath72=d@xmath73sin@xmath10@xmath37 yields a lower limit of @xmath37@xmath924@xmath74 ( @xmath37@xmath750@xmath74 corresponds to face - on ) . and",
    "third , assuming that the starburst disk is supported by radiation pressure on dust grains yields an eddington limit on the fir flux of @xmath76@xmath210@xmath15  ( e.g. , scoville @xcite ; thompson  @xcite ) . assuming that all @xmath77 is due to star formation in the gas - rich reservoir , this yields a lower limit on @xmath54 of @xmath78=735pc .",
    "note that the corresponding dust brightness temperature limit of @xmath79=88k is more than twice as high as the @xmath80 obtained from fitting the spectral energy distribution ( capak @xcite ) , which may indicate that @xmath81 in aztec-3 is well below the eddington limit on average , contrary to what is seen , e.g. , in the center of the @xmath1=6.42 quasar j1148 + 5251 ( walter @xcite ; riechers  @xcite ) .",
    "based on these constraints on @xmath55 , and assuming that @xmath8 and @xmath11 are correct , another interesting limit arises :  for the galaxy not to be dark matter - dominated ( @xmath64@xmath750% ) within its central few kpc , the system has to be seen at @xmath37@xmath935@xmath74 , and the starburst disk has to be relatively compact ( @xmath54@xmath72.3kpc ) . assuming a probably more realistic @xmath82=25%@xmath1410% ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "@xcite ) would suggest limiting @xmath37@xmath644@xmath74@xmath144@xmath74 ( at @xmath83 ) and @xmath54@xmath231.5@xmath140.2kpc ( at @xmath37=90@xmath74 ) .",
    "overall , the observations thus may favor a relatively compact , highly inclined galaxy , with a high , perhaps dominant , fraction of molecular gas ( @xmath63=0.30.8 ) that also dominates the baryonic mass in this system ( @xmath63@xmath20.84@xmath67 ) . despite the limited spatial resolution of this detection experiment , the diagnostic plot introduced here allows us to constrain the dynamical mass in this system to within a factor of @xmath523",
    ". however , dynamically resolved co observations at high ( @xmath70.7@xmath24 ) spatial resolution are necessary to determine to what degree the assumptions made here are correct .",
    "also , potential effects of non - virial dynamics ( such as in a merger ) require further investigation .",
    "we have detected a molecular gas reservoir in the highest - redshift smg aztec-3 ( @xmath1=5.298 ) that is comparable in mass to ` typical ' @xmath1@xmath92 smgs ( e.g. , greve  @xcite ; ivison @xcite ; harris  @xcite ) and likely has a low - excitation component similar in gas properties to that seen in another @xmath1@xmath94 smg ( carilli @xcite ) , but in addition has a high - excitation gas component with properties similar to @xmath1@xmath94 quasar host galaxies ( e.g. , riechers  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the peak of the gas distribution is coincident with the rest - frame optical and far - infrared emission ( stellar light and dust - enshrouded star formation ) , but slightly offset from the peak of the rest - frame uv emission ( unobscured star formation ) , which appears to consist of multiple bright clumps .",
    "given the high gas mass fraction and star formation rate of this galaxy , this suggests the presence of a heavily obscured starburst , possibly triggered by a major , ` wet ' ( i.e. , very gas - rich ) , @xmath238kpc - scale merger .",
    "this is reminiscent of what is seen in ` typical ' @xmath1@xmath92 smgs ( e.g. , tacconi @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of luminous co emission implies relatively advanced enrichment with heavy elements in the material that fuels the observed early burst of star formation in aztec-3 . assuming a galactic abundance of co yields @xmath84@xmath27@xmath310@xmath58 .",
    "such a level of early metal enrichment could be achieved through a few @xmath310@xmath58 hundred solar mass population - iii stars ( e.g. , walter @xcite ) .",
    "this order - of - magnitude estimate , however , corresponds to @xmath610% @xmath11 , and would require a quite ` top - heavy ' imf .",
    "we thus speculate that asymptotic giant branch stars and supernovae may be extremely efficient in enriching their environments at such early epochs , or that the stellar mass may be underpredicted due to obscuration in the most intensely star - forming regions .",
    "the unusually high - excitation gas component in aztec-3 ( for a smg ) raises the question whether or not the environment may play a role in determining its star formation properties .",
    "aztec-3 has two close , massive companions with consistent photometric redshifts within only 12.2kpc .",
    "the molecular gas reservoir is clearly spatially separated from the companions ; however , gravitational interactions may still play a role at such small distances , which may explain an above average peak gas density ( leading to high co excitation ) .",
    "the most similar object probably is the @xmath1=4.055 smg gn20 , which evolves in a comparably overdense environment ( daddi @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the co reservoir in aztec-3 is more compact , ( partially ) higher excited , and less than half as massive as that in gn20 .",
    "this may either indicate that the ( overdense ) cosmic environments of both galaxies are considerably different ( gn20 even has two massive smg companions within 180kpc distance ) , or that they are in different stages of their evolution as a smg .",
    "the likely presence of a substantial low - excitation gas component besides highly - excited gas in both systems may point at a fundamental difference in physical properties between the star - forming environments in @xmath1@xmath94 smgs and @xmath1@xmath94 fir - luminous quasar host galaxies ( e.g. , riechers  @xcite ) , which may trace overall different evolutionary stages of galaxies with comparable , high gas masses and star formation rates .",
    "this difference may arise due to a higher average concentration of the gas in the quasar hosts ( rather than large - scale influence of the active nucleus ) , e.g. , due to later merger stages .",
    "this would be consistent with a scenario where smgs evolve into fir - luminous quasars ( e.g. , sanders @xcite ; coppin  @xcite ) .",
    "both populations are likely progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the present - day universe .",
    "this investigation clearly motivates more detailed studies of the first smgs and quasars , which will enable us to directly probe the scales that are critical to unravel the physical processes that drive the clustered evolution of massive galaxies in the early universe , back to the first billion years after the big bang .",

    "<S> we report the detection of , 5@xmath04 , and 6@xmath05 emission in the highest - redshift submillimeter galaxy ( smg ) aztec-3 at @xmath1=5.298 , using the expanded very large array and the plateau de bure interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> these observations ultimately confirm the redshift , making aztec-3 the most submillimeter - luminous galaxy in a massive @xmath1@xmath25.3 protocluster structure in the cosmos field . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the co line emission reveals a large molecular gas reservoir with a mass of 5.3@xmath310@xmath4 , which can maintain the intense 1800starburst in this system for at least 30myr , increasing the stellar mass by up to a factor of six in the process . </S>",
    "<S> this gas mass is comparable to ` typical ' @xmath1@xmath52 smgs , and constitutes @xmath680% of the baryonic mass ( gas+stars ) and 30%80% of the total ( dynamical ) mass in this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular gas reservoir has a radius of @xmath74kpc and likely consists of a ` diffuse ' , low - excitation component , containing ( at least ) 1/3 of the gas mass ( depending on the relative conversion factor @xmath8 ) , and a ` dense ' , high - excitation component , containing @xmath52/3 of the mass . </S>",
    "<S> the likely presence of a substantial diffuse component besides highly - excited gas suggests different properties between the star - forming environments in @xmath1@xmath94 smgs and @xmath1@xmath94 quasar host galaxies , which perhaps trace different evolutionary stages . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of a massive , metal - enriched gas reservoir in a smg at the heart of a large @xmath1=5.3 protocluster considerably enhances our understanding of early massive galaxy formation , pushing back to a cosmic epoch where the universe was less than 1/12 of its present age . </S>"
