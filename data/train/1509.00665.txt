    "( 3 ) , we only have to study @xmath109 in more detail to compute @xmath108 .",
    "we find that the natural measure of @xmath110 is proportional to its relative area inside @xmath29 , @xmath111 this follows from the fact that the forward escaping sets @xmath76 decompose the backward trapped set @xmath67 in the unstable ( horizontal ) direction , on which @xmath22 is uniformly distributed within @xmath4 and @xmath13 individually , see fig .",

    "this is indicated by the numerical findings for the partial - barrier standard map , fig .  2 , as well as the standard map , fig .  4 , compared to eq .  ( 4 ) .",
    "the main reason for the deviations of eq .",

    "to this end , one may define a uniform grid of @xmath115 points in phase space of which one has to discard points which leave the system within @xmath116 iterations of the map  @xmath43 in backward time direction . for fig .  4 , we choose @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "points within a regular phase - space region should be omitted manually .",
