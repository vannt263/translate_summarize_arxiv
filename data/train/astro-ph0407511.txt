    "polar ring galaxies ( prg s ) are early - type galaxies with rings of gas , stars , and dust that orbit nearly perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the central galaxy . it is generally assumed that they result from an accretion or merger event that occurred some time after the host galaxy formed ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter prc ) .",
    "objects that have undergone a recent merger often show vigorous star formation ( _ e.g. _ , schweizer 2000 ) ; hence one might expect prg s to exhibit signs of enhanced star formation , either in the polar ring or in the host galaxy , as a result of the interaction that formed the polar ring . in many prg s , the bulk of the ring material appears to be in regular rotation about the galaxy center @xcite , and is presumably stabilized in some way .",
    "however , some of the accreted ring gas may still be flowing into the host galaxy ; high - resolution optical images give indications that this may be happening in ngc  4650a @xcite .",
    "the inflowing gas might fuel an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) or cause a burst of star formation in the galaxy center .",
    "radio continuum emission in galaxies at wavelengths longer than 1 cm is generally dominated by synchrotron radiation from ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "these cosmic rays may be accelerated either by an active nucleus or by supernovae of types ib or ii in star - forming regions .",
    "synchrotron emission from an active nucleus is usually the primary source of radio continuum emission in early - type galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sjk89 ) . in star - forming disk systems",
    ", the dominant process appears to be acceleration by supernovae @xcite .",
    "radio emission is then cospatial with star formation , and free - free radiation from regions will contribute at the higher radio frequencies .",
    "it is possible to distinguish between these two mechanisms for accelerating electrons and producing radio continuum flux by examining the radio morphology , the correlation between the radio and far - infrared ( fir ) fluxes , and the radio spectral indices of the sources ( see section  4 ) .",
    "little information is currently available about the radio / fir correlation or radio spectral indices for prgs .",
    "however , radio continuum emission at 20 cm has been mapped in a few polar rings to date , often in conjunction with observations in the 21 cm line of . in the polar ring galaxy eso  1327 - 2041",
    "( prc  c-46 ; carilli &  van  gorkom 1992 ) about half of the emission comes from the optical center of the galaxy , while the rest is from the brightest knots in the polar ring . in ngc  4650a ( prc  a-05 ; arnaboldi _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) , ic  51 ( prc  b-01 ; wilkinson _",
    "et  al._1987 ) , and ii  zw  71 ( prc  b-17 ; cox _ et  al . _  2001 ) , the emission is from the polar material .",
    "the implication is that the radio emission in these galaxies is from widespread star formation ; it is not dominated by active or star - forming nuclei , perhaps because little of the polar gas is finding its way to the central regions .",
    "we have used the very large array ( vla ) aperture synthesis telescope to map a sample of prg s in the 6 cm and 20 cm bands of radio continuum , to measure the total fluxes , and determine whether the emission comes primarily from the galaxy center or from the polar material .",
    "we compare our detection rate and radio spectral indices with those found in radio continuum surveys of early - type galaxies without polar rings @xcite .",
    "we also examine the morphology , radio / fir correlation , and radio spectral indices for these galaxies , asking whether the emission is likely to be a consequence of ongoing star formation or an agn . assuming that star - formation is the dominant source of the radio emission , we derive star - formation rates and gas - consumption timescales for the survey prgs .",
    "we have conducted a survey of 40 prg s in the 20 cm and 6 cm bands , using the vla `` b '' and `` c '' configurations , respectively , to obtain maps with matched resolution ( @xmath05 ) in the two bands .",
    "the objects in our sample were chosen from categories a , b , or c ( confirmed , probable , or possible polar rings ) of the `` polar - ring catalog '' ( prc ) .",
    "we selected those with @xmath3@xmath4@xmath530@xmath6  ( far enough north for a good synthesized beam with the vla ) and angular size @xmath74 .",
    "the latter criterion eliminated ngc  660 ( prc  c-13 ) , a known starburst galaxy @xcite , and ngc  3384 ( prc  c-34 ) .",
    "we also removed the known quasar 3cr  249.1 ( prc  c-36 ) from our sample .",
    "fifty - nine galaxies met these criteria .",
    "forty of these were observed at 20 cm , selected only by the hour angles available at our scheduled observing times .",
    "sixteen of our 20 cm targets were also observed at 6 cm , selecting preferentially those galaxies detected at 20 cm or with known redshifts .",
    "the basic data for these galaxies , including positions , redshifts , and fir fluxes , are listed in table  1 .",
    "standard calibration and mapping procedures were followed .",
    "maps were made with uniform weighting to maximize spatial resolution .",
    "a source was counted as detected if it was ( 1 ) extended and at least 3-@xmath1 above the noise at either wavelength , or ( 2 ) a point source at least 5-@xmath1 above the noise at either wavelength , at the position of the target galaxy . the probability of detecting an unrelated source brighter than 1  mjy within 5  of the target galaxy is only 0.05%@xcite  confusion with background sources should not be a significant problem at these detection limits .    for the most distant objects in our survey , our detection limit would allow us to detect any galaxy with an excess of radio emission ( larger than a few times that of a normal spiral galaxy ; see @xcite .",
    "we detected 20 of the 40 observed galaxies at 20 cm , and 13 of the 16 observed galaxies at 6 cm .",
    "our detection rate of 50% at 20 cm , down to a 5-@xmath1 limiting flux density of @xmath00.5  mjy  beam@xmath2 , is similar to the 42% detection rate of elliptical galaxies with shells , down to the same limiting flux density , found by w87 .",
    "these detection rates are not significantly different from the population of `` normal '' early - type galaxies studied by sjk89 ( also 42% ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wh91 ) .",
    "the radio continuum fluxes and radio spectral indices for our sample are shown in table  2 , along with 21 cm fluxes and  masses , when available . for non - detections",
    ", we show 5-@xmath8 upper limits , assuming any continuum emission is unresolved . for unresolved sources ,",
    "the total uncertainty was calculated by adding two terms in quadrature : an assumed 3%  uncertainty in the total flux due to calibration @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the rms uncertainty @xmath8 measured in the cleaned images .",
    "typical rms uncertainties were 0.1mjy  beam@xmath10  at 20 cm and 0.08mjy  beam@xmath10  at 6 cm ( with ranges between 0.06 - 0.2mjy  beam@xmath10  and 0.03 - 0.11mjy  beam@xmath10 , respectively ) .",
    "for extended sources , the rms uncertainty in the integrated flux is increased by a factor of @xmath11 , where n is the number of beam areas over which we integrated to measure the source flux .",
    "the total uncertainty is thus the calibration error @xmath9 , added in quadrature with @xmath12 .",
    "in our sample , 15 ( 75% ) of the 20 sources we detected are unresolved at @xmath05  resolution .",
    "thirteen of these 15 sources are located at the optical center of the galaxy , to within our 5  resolution .",
    "one of those thirteen sources , prc  c-73 , has two point sources at both 20 cm and 6 cm , at the positions of the two brightest peaks at optical wavelengths .",
    "the two unresolved sources for which the radio position does not correspond to the optical center of the target galaxy are prc  a-03 ( ngc  2685 , the `` helix galaxy '' ) and prc  c-60 ( eso  464-g31 ) .",
    "the radio source in prc  a-03 lies 10  from the galaxy center , at a position angle of 58@xmath13 , within a region of extended h@xmath14  emission around the nucleus of the galaxy @xcite . though the ionized gas in this region does rotate about the minor axis of the host galaxy @xcite , it is not part of what has traditionally been called the polar ring , which lies at radii beyond @xmath035  from the galaxy center . the radio emission in prc  c-60 coincides with the optical center of the galaxy mcg05 - 50 - 009 , the companion to eso  464-g31 .",
    "these two galaxies together make up the galaxy pair that was included in the prc as a possible polar ring .",
    "the morphology of the extended sources in our sample is quite different than the radio morphology of typical e / s0 galaxies without polar rings .",
    "none of the five sources that have extended structure in our @xmath05  resolution maps show the `` core - jet '' structure typical of agn s . the radio continuum morphologies are consistent with star formation either in the candidate polar ring ( prc  b-01 & b-21 ) or in an extended region of the central galaxy ( prc  c-24 , c-28 , &  c-51 ) .",
    "two of the latter sources do have bright peaks at the galaxy center ( prc  c-28 &  c-51 ) , but the rest of the radio emission in these two galaxies is diffuse and extends throughout the disk of the central object .",
    "radio continuum maps for the five extended sources , as well as for prc  c-73 , are discussed in the following subsections .    _ * prc b-01 * _ ( ic  51 , arp  230 )    this galaxy is a well - known shell elliptical galaxy , and was included in the sample of shell elliptical galaxies mapped in the radio continuum by w87 .",
    "it is listed as a candidate polar - ring galaxy in the prc because it is known to have a fast - rotating disk or annulus of gas , dust , and stars perpendicular to the apparent morphological major axis of the stellar body .",
    "observations in the 21 cm line and h@xmath14  by d. schiminovich ( 1996 , private communication ) show gas components that rotate about the minor axis of the dust lane / polar ring , but also emission well above the plane of the dust lane .",
    "the  appears to be associated with the outer shells , while the h@xmath14  emission is in a `` fluffy disk '' around the dust lane .",
    "because of the interesting morphology of the radio continuum in this galaxy , we observed it for 30 minutes in each of the vla b and c configurations .",
    "thus , we have slightly better sensitivity on this source than on the other sources in our sample ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the majority of the radio continuum emission in this galaxy , at both 20 cm and 6 cm , is aligned with the dust lane ( the candidate polar ring ) . however , with our improved sensitivity , we see filaments that extend well above the optical plane of the candidate polar ring ; maps made with both uniform and natural weighting , at both wavelengths , are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the morphology of this source indicates that current star formation is the most likely source of the radio continuum emission in this galaxy .    _",
    "* prc b-21 * _ ( eso  603-g21 )    the radio continuum emission in our 20 cm and 6 cm observations is only resolved along one direction , coincident with the major axis of the dust lanes observed in the central portions of the candidate polar ring ( prc ; see figure  2 ) . however , the optical extent of the candidate polar ring is @xmath050(prc ) , while the 20 cm and 6 cm continuum emission we detect has an extent of only 10 - 15 .",
    "@xcite find that most of the emission at 2  ( @xmath15 band ) comes from a plane close to that of the dust lane .",
    "they suggest that this is not a prg , but a disk galaxy with abnormally heavy dust extinction and a very blue bulge .    _",
    "* prc c-24 * _ ( ugc  4261 )    the 20 cm emission in this galaxy does not appear to be aligned with a particular plane ; rather , there is a bright central core , surrounded by an apparently smooth and nearly round `` halo '' of emission .",
    "if the extension to the northeast of the majority of the emission is real , it would be interesting , as it lies approximately along the candidate polar ring in this galaxy ( prc ; see figure  3 ) .",
    "although there may be a bright core of emission in the galaxy center , the radio emission does not exhibit the typical `` core - jet '' morphology of an agn .",
    "_ * prc c-28 * _ ( ngc  2748 )    the emission in this galaxy extends nearly the entire length of the galaxy disk at 20 cm .",
    "there is a bright central core , but it contains only @xmath05%  of the total emission ; nearly all of the 20 cm emission comes from the diffuse component in the galaxy disk .",
    "none of the emission appears to be associated with the candidate polar ring ( see figure  4 ) ; it is probably due to star formation in the disk of the host galaxy .    _",
    "* prc c-51 * _ ( ngc  6286 , arp  293 )    the morphology of the 20 cm emission in this galaxy is very similar to that of prc  c-28  there is a bright central core , surrounded by diffuse emission that extends throughout the disk of the galaxy ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "however , the unresolved core component in this object contains @xmath035%  of the total 20 cm emission in this object . again",
    ", none of the continuum emission we detect appears to be associated with the candidate polar ring .",
    "the high 20 cm flux suggests a starburst ( see section  4 ) .",
    "the `` polar ring '' in this galaxy appears to be incomplete , and the optical morphology of the incomplete ring suggests that ngc  6286 is currently interacting with its close companion , ngc  6285 ( prc ) .",
    "_ * prc c-73 * _ ( a  2358 - 2604 )    these two point sources correspond to the optical positions of the two brightest peaks at optical wavelengths ( see figure  6 ) , which may be two distinct galaxies in the process of merging .",
    "this morphology is consistent with the interpretation in the prc , that the apparent polar ring feature in this candidate prg is actually tidal debris oriented so that it resembles a polar ring in projection .",
    "the difference between a tidal tail that looks like a polar ring , and an actual polar ring , may simply be a matter of the time at which one observes the interaction .",
    "emission from both faint point sources was included in calculations of total radio flux and the radio spectral index for this object ( see table  2 ) .",
    "as discussed in section  3 , the radio morphology of the extended sources in our sample is consistent with relativistic electrons from recent supernovae as the source of most of the radio continuum emission . to determine whether this is true for most of the galaxies in our sample",
    ", we can examine the radio / fir correlation and the radio spectral indices for the candidate prgs .",
    "for the 17 galaxies with known fluxes at both 20 cm and 60 , we have plotted the radio versus the fir fluxes in figure  7a . as discussed in section",
    "2 , it is unlikely that any of the sources we did not detect contain strong radio sources  our failure to detect them at 20  cm is consistent with the fir / radio correlation for star - forming galaxies .",
    "none of the sources in our sample lies significantly outside the envelope of the correlation for star - forming galaxies ( from wh91 ) , and most lie well within it .",
    "this is not true for early - type galaxies without polar rings ; a large fraction of these `` normal '' galaxies have significant radio excesses over the fir / radio correlation shown in figure  7a , pointing to the presence of agn s ( _ e.g. _ , reddy &  yun 2004 ; wh91 ) . in our sample ,",
    "all five of the extended sources have most of their radio power in a diffuse component , and none of the detected sources has a significant radio excess .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether this difference between our result and that for non - prg s is due to the presence of a polar ring , or to the proportion of elliptical to lenticular galaxies .",
    "wh91 find that elliptical galaxies are much more likely to have a radio excess than lenticular galaxies , and most confirmed polar rings tend to be around lenticular galaxies rather than elliptical galaxies ( prc ; van  driel _ et  al . _  2000",
    ". however , the presence of the polar ring makes the central galaxy difficult to classify without detailed study .",
    "the radio spectral indices for the twelve candidate prg s detected at both 20 cm and 6 cm are shown as a histogram in figure  7b .",
    "the errors for these calculated spectral indices were calculated using the 5-@xmath1 uncertainties in the total fluxes with standard formal error calculations , and are shown in column  9 of table  2 . with two exceptions ( prc  a-03 & b-17 ) , all errors are @xmath160.1 in spectral index .    taking s@xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 , figure  7b shows a slight excess of `` steep - spectrum '' objects ( @xmath20 ) , compared to `` flat - spectrum '' objects ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "steep - spectrum sources of synchrotron emission are optically thin , and generally correspond either to regions of star formation , or the extended radio lobes of an agn .",
    "we see no evidence for extended radio lobes in these prg s .",
    "synchrotron emission from the `` core '' of an active nucleus is often optically thick , so that the source has a flat spectrum .",
    "the only one of the flat - spectrum objects that is extended ( prc  b-21 ; see figure  2 ) does not have the core - jet morphology typical of an agn .",
    "thus , no more than four of our sources have the morphology and spectral indices expected if agn s contribute significantly to the radio emission .    assuming , therefore , that all of the 20 cm emission in these galaxies is due to star formation , rather than agn s , we have used the formula of @xcite to calculate the rate at which massive ( @xmath22@xmath235m@xmath24 ) stars are formed from the radio continuum emission ( see figure  7c ) .",
    "interestingly , the category `` a '' and `` b '' galaxies ( confirmed and probable prg s ; shown as open circles in figure  7c ) have lower star - formation rates , on average , than the category `` c '' galaxies ( possible prg s ; shown as filled circles in figure  7c ) .",
    "none of these implied star - formation rates are high , compared to normal disk galaxies . for those galaxies with known  masses ( see table  2 ) , we use these star - formation rates to compute gas - consumption timescales , assuming a salpeter initial mass function truncated at @xmath22@xmath160.4m@xmath24(figure  7d ) .",
    "only one of the galaxies in our sample , prc  c-51 , could use up all of its gas in @xmath2510@xmath26  years , and thus may fall into the category of `` starburst '' galaxies .",
    "although the majority of the radio emission in these candidate prgs likely arises from recent star - formation activity , the rates implied are not high compared to the total available gas in the galaxies .",
    "we conclude that polar - ring galaxies have radio continuum fluxes typical of normal ( non - polar - ring ) elliptical or s0 galaxies .",
    "the morphology of the extended sources , the spectral indices , and fir fluxes of the prg s in our sample indicate that the radio emission is predominantly due to star - forming regions rather than nuclear activity .",
    "however , the rate of starbirth is modest  all but one of our sample galaxies have enough cool gas to fuel their star formation for at least another gigayear .",
