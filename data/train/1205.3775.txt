    "linear wave propagation in homogeneous porous media saturated with a viscothermal fluid such as ambient air , has been the subject of extensive research .",
    "traditionally , for the case when the wavelength is large compared to the pore size , it has been described on the basis of the so - called two - scale asymptotic homogenization theory @xcite@xcite . for materials with skeleton sufficiently heavy and/or rigid to be motionless , this leads to an effective medium theory in which the medium permittivities are two linear operators , one representing an effective density and the other an effective compressibility @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these operators , while nonlocal in time as a result of delayed responses due to the losses ( temporal dispersion ) , are given as local in space by the homogenization process at the dominant order .",
    "in other words , no spatial dispersion arises , so that the response of the material at a given macroscopic point ( physically , an elementary coarse - graining volume ) is determined by the history of the pertinent field variables at the given point but not the neighboring points . as such",
    ", this description is a special case not directly applicable to all geometries .",
    "it does not describe the situations where structures in the form of helmholtz resonators are presentin this case , if the microgeometry splits in parts with pore sizes sufficiently different to imply different rescalings of the microscopic governing equations in the different parts , a solution can still be written using the principle of asymptotic homogenization @xcite . independently , a general nonlocal theory of propagation along a symmetry axis in macroscopically homogeneous materials having arbitrary microgeometry , has been recently proposed by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "finally , different high - frequencies extensions of the idea of two - scale homogenization have also been introduced recently @xcite@xcite .",
    "all of these extensions lie outside the scope of the present paper , as defined next . ] .",
    "nevertheless , most of the materials used in noise control for sound absorption , do not present in their inner structure very different pores sizes . in this paper",
    "we explicitly assume the absence of very different pores sizes , automatically ensuring at long wavelengths the validity of the usual two - scale asymptotic homogenization .",
    "it gives us explicit recipes to compute from microgeometry the effective density and compressibility , complex functions of frequency but not of wavenumber , in the above framework . in practice ,",
    "the computation is not possible in full detail ; it is however not required to be done to arrive at a relatively precise description . in absence of a complete knowledge of the microgeometry , a widely used semi - phenomenological model which depends on a small set of independently measurable geometrical parameters of the structure ,",
    "is given by the well - known formula of johnson @xmath5 @xmath6 joh for the density , and likewise , the champoux - allard @xcite or the lafarge @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite formula for the compressibility .",
    "these approximate expressions ( denoted @xmath0 ) of the two constitutive functions , essentially are the result of :    \\1 ) an exact description of the high - frequency limits of the two functions , density and compressibility , in terms of the concepts of ideal - fluid tortuosity @xmath7 and characteristic lengths @xmath8 joh and @xmath9 @xcite , the viscous and thermal relaxation processes being ` frozen ' in this limitin the frozen limit the viscous and thermal relaxation processes have no time to develop ; in the relaxed limit they have enough time to fully develop . ] ,    \\2 ) an exact description of the low - frequency limits , in terms of the concepts of d.c .",

    ". the pure causality condition would only require the singularities to be in a half plane .",
    "our stronger assumption may be rephrased physically by saying that the fluid velocity pattern at the pore scale is divergence - free for the purpose of the determination of the density , and the pressure pattern is uniform for the purpose of the determination of the compressibility ; or in essence , that the operators are local operators in space , at long wavelengths , in the geometries we consider .",
    "the remaining assumption that the functions are the simplest reasonable ` relaxation ' ones , consists in making the additional but adjacent assumption that the considered geometries manifest a relatively narrow  not bimodal , for example  distribution of pore sizes .",
    "then the distribution of poles on the imaginary axis is simple and the whole pattern of response functions on the real axis is strongly determined by the low- and high - frequency behaviors .    in this manner , a simple , resp .",
    "viscous and thermal , relaxation - transition description of the density and compressibility functions is obtained , that may be thought to be well - verified in a wide class of materials as long as the wavelengths are large compared to the typical dimensions of the coarse - graining averaging volumes . at this point",
    ", we may mention a similar relaxation - transition approach , developed by wilson @xcite . in wilson s",
    "approach , the emphasis is not made on the low - frequency and high - frequency limits , but directly on the transition .",
    "the quality of the description obtainable with wilson s models is comparable to that of model @xmath14 , but the parameters become purely adjustable parameters not precisely defined in terms of the microgeometry , and not clearly obtainable by non - acoustical means .",
    "subsequently , the low - frequency relaxed limit 2 ) was made more precise by pride @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite and lafarge @xcite ( the next viscous and nontrivial thermal terms now being exactly described thanks to the introduction of the additional notions of d.c .",
    "viscous and thermal tortuosities @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , resulting in a slightly improved ( denoted @xmath1 ) description of the relaxation transitions of the two functions .",
    "notice that some confusions were present in the original works @xcite and @xcite ( not readily available ) and other subsequent ones ( e.g. @xcite ) , so that the presentation we give later on , of the @xmath1 description , may be worthwhile .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , fellah @xmath5 @xmath6 concentrated on the time - domain expression of the high - frequencies asymptotics implied by this modela short , non exhaustive list of works concerned with the time - domain description is : @xcite-@xcite . ] .",
    "expanding , in the high - frequency limit , the @xmath1 density and compressibility in powers of the inverse stokes number @xmath17 ( defined as the ratio between boundary layer thickness and characteristic pore size ) , and retaining the ( exact ) zero and first order terms and the ( model - dependent ) second order terms , they derived an asymptotic time - domain pressure wave equation . using fractional - derivative and laplace - transform calculus , they were able to solve this equation in elegant manner through the calculation of a corresponding asymptotic green s function of the unbounded medium .",
    "recall that a green s function or impulse response , as a function of time , extends and flattens when observed at fixed locations more and more remote from the spatial point where it originates .",
    "now , the results of the calculations made in @xcite seem to indicate that the terms of second order yield a significant effect on the green s function for resistive porous materials , and , in addition , that the effect is mainly an effect on the amplitude without noticeable distortion of the time wave pattern ( see figs . 2 and 3 of paper @xcite ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "our purpose is threefold .",
    "first , we wish taking advantage of recent clarifications regarding nonlocal ( spatial dispersion ) effects@xcite to propose a lucid review of the above local ( frequency dispersion ) theory , stressing the physical hypotheses behind it . by recalling the construction principle of the models @xmath0 and @xmath18 ,",
    "we make clear that these models @xmath19 @xmath20 lead to inaccurate descriptions of the second order high - frequency terms @xmath21 .",
    "this is highlighted on the simple example of cylindrical circular tubes .",
    "this is the matter of section [ be ] .",
    "next , we give a very simple analytic derivation of the attenuation - without - distortion finding of ref .",
    "@xcite summarized above .",
    "indeed , generalizing to arbitrary geometry a work done by polack @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite for cylindrical circular tubes , we show the following exact property ( for 1d propagation along one axis @xmath22 ) : @xmath23where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the two first asymptotic green s functions computed by retaining in the wavenumber the terms up to the first and second order on the inverse stokes number @xmath17 respectively .",
    "this is done in section [ sw ] , using a scaled - form of the green s function .",
    "the first is only determined by @xmath7 , @xmath26 and @xmath9 , and exactly predicted by the models @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the second demonstrates the mentioned attenuation - without - distortion effect through the exponential .",
    "the decay length @xmath4 , however , depends in part of the next frozen parameters , two viscous and thermal purely geometrical characteristic surfaces @xmath27 and @xmath28 involved in the above - mentioned terms @xmath21 : @xmath29 ^{-1 } ,   \\label{decay l}\\]]where the fluid constants are , @xmath30 the fluid kinematic viscosity , @xmath31 the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath32 the prandtl number , and @xmath33 the ratio of heat coefficients .",
    "now , because the models @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( especially @xmath0 ) give inaccurate predictions for the @xmath21 terms , this decay length @xmath34 will not be accurately captured by the models .",
    "indeed , on the simple example of cylindrical circular tubes it can be checked that @xmath34 is completely misrepresented by model @xmath0 , which gives a negative estimate for it , and still largely underestimated by model @xmath1 , which produces only about @xmath35 of its correct value , due to @xmath36 overestimation of surfaces @xmath27 and @xmath28 . both models @xmath37 and @xmath1 do not describe the correct high - frequency attenuation - without - distortion effect .",
    "technical details are given in appendix to lighten the main text .    finally , our last objective is to show that , in spite of its faulty description of the decay length @xmath4 ( [ decay l ] ) , the model @xmath1 , nevertheless furnishes a relatively precise description of the complete exact green s function , especially when compared to other formulas .",
    "the asymptotic analytic green s function @xmath38 provides a reasonable description of the complete green s function with the same number of parameters as @xmath0 , but it uses parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 which are unknown in general .",
    "the merits and drawbacks of the different descriptions are illustrated on the example of circular pores ",
    "@xmath2 ) computing the exact green s function through fft and the known zwikker and kosten full frequency formulas ; @xmath3 ) computing likewise the model green s functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 through fft ; @xmath39 ) computing the exact asymptotic green s function @xmath38 through ( [ o2]-[decay l ] ) with the known exact values of the involved parameters ( namely @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) ; and @xmath43 ) computing the ` model asymptotic ' green s functions through ( [ o2]-[decay l ] ) with the model values of the involved parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 for @xmath1 and @xmath47 for @xmath0 ) .",
    "the results of fft computation are given in section [ fftc ] for the full - frequency models , while the results for asymptotic expansions are given in appendix .",
    "we start by recalling the form of the macroscopic equivalent - fluid equations in the frequency domain ( see @xcite):@xmath48where by definition , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the macroscopic velocity and pressure obtained by coarse - graining ( averaging ) the microscopic fluid velocity and pressure fields , @xmath51 is the time derivative , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the saturating - fluid density and adiabatic bulk modulus , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the dynamic tortuosity and the dynamic compressibility . notice that for simplicity , isotropy or 1d propagation along one principal axis is assumed , so that @xmath54 is a scalar .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) make apparent the frequencies but not the wavenumbers associated to the time- and space - variable fields .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of spatial dispersion are negligible .",
    "a necessary  but not sufficient  condition for this , is that the wavelengths are large .",
    "the complementary condition which will ensure that spatial locality is verified , is that no very different pore sizes are present , so that in particular , the presence of structures in the form of helmholtz resonators is excluded .",
    "indeed , with resonators , the fluid exchanged to and fro , is always associated by mass conservation with a corresponding spatial inhomogeneity in the wavefield .",
    "the resonance can not occur without concomitant spatial inhomogeneity in the macroscopic fields .",
    "as such , it is an effect of spatial dispersion , see @xcite p. 360",
    ", no matter how large the wavelengths actually are . now ,",
    "if we restrict sufficiently the possible geometries , resonances can not occur and the long - wavelength propagation becomes practically devoid of spatial dispersion @xmath12 is given by the traditional homogenization .",
    "the application of the asymptotic two - scale homogenization then yields two different microscopic boundary value formal problems to be solved for determining the two constitutive functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .    the first action - response problem specifies the ( velocity ) response of a viscous incompressible fluid subject to an applied time harmonic , spatially uniform bulk force source term : @xmath58 in the pore space ( with @xmath59 a periodic or stationary random field , in periodic or stationary random geometries ) , and satisfying on the pore surface ( no slip condition ) , @xmath60 in this problem , @xmath61 is a dimensionless unit vector in the direction of the applied bulk force , and @xmath62 is the scaled response velocity field ( dimension of @xmath63 ) .",
    "it determines the dynamic permeability @xmath64 and dynamic tortuosity @xmath54 introduced in the landmark paper by johnson @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite , by the relations : @xmath65where @xmath66 is the coarse - graining averaging operation in the pore space , and @xmath67 is the porosity ( specific connected pore volume ) .    the second action - response problem specifies the ( excess temperature ) response of a thermal fluid subject to an applied time harmonic , spatially uniform pressure source term : @xmath68 in the pore space , and satisfying on the pore surface ( no temperature - jump condition ) is assumed sufficiently important to ensure that the specific fluid - solid mass ratio is small ; then the solid is inert thermally and remains at ambient temperature . ] ) , @xmath69here , @xmath70 is a dimensionless unit constant representing the applied pressure , and @xmath71 is the scaled response excess temperature field ( dimension of @xmath63 ) .",
    "it determines the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , thermal counterparts of functions @xmath64 and @xmath54 introduced by lafarge lafargeth , lafarge , and then , the effective compressibility @xmath74 , by the following relationships : @xmath75where @xmath76 is the ratio of the specific heats .    the above action - response problems and response - factor identifications ( d4 ) and ( [ d4 ] ) are written in blind manner by applying the traditional two - scale asymptotic homogenization .",
    "as we have insisted , it makes the important assumption that it is possible to neglect spatial dispersion .",
    "this is manifested in the first problem by the force source term @xmath61 which is set to a spatial constant ( simultaneously , the velocity field @xmath49 is represented by a divergence - free field ) , and in the second problem by the pressure source term @xmath70 which is also set to a spatial constant ( gradient - free)in fact , what is really meant here is that in this second problem , locally , the pressure field may be viewed as having a uniform gradient ; but the pressure linear variation around the mean may be omitted in a coarse graining volume , as it has no effect on the mean temperature .",
    "as soon as spatial dispersion is introduced , it no longer makes sense to represent the source terms by spatial constants .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity of the source terms must be considered . ] .",
    "indeed , we could have written these problems and identifications directly without using the homogenization process , on the sole basis of assuming that spatial dispersion effects are absent .",
    "now , as a result of the divergence - free and gradient - free nature of velocity and pressure in the given action - response problems , it can be shown that the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 have purely imaginary singularities @xcite , @xcite , and thus are smooth functions on the real axis  this is the point 3 ) mentioned in introduction .",
    "this crucial point in the construction of the models will be considered at more length in section @xmath79 .      in absence of a complete information on the microgeometry ,",
    "the two above - mentioned microscopic formal boundary - value problems can not entirely be worked out and their exact detailed solutions ( from which @xmath80 and @xmath55 can in principle be extracted by coarse - graining , see eqs.([d4 ] ) and ( [ d4 ] ) ) are missing . nevertheless , in the limit of high - frequencies and low - frequencies , some general characteristics of the solutions and corresponding functions @xmath54 and @xmath74 may be obtained .",
    "that may be sketched as follows .      in the limit of high frequencies , the viscous and thermal terms @xmath81 and @xmath82 become negligibly small compared to the other terms . the fluid motions , except for vanishingly small viscous and thermal boundary layers at the pore walls , become close to those of an inviscid nonconducting fluid ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , with @xmath85 the thermal conductivity @xmath86 .",
    "we refer to this limit simply as the ` frozen limit ' ( see footnote [ frozen ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 everywhere tend ( except at the pore walls ) to the ` frozen ' fields @xmath89 and @xmath90 verifying the following equations in the pore space , ( with @xmath91 a periodic or stationary random field , in periodic or stationary random geometries ) , @xmath92and verifying at the pore walls ( @xmath93 is the normal on the latter ) , @xmath94    now assume , following johnson @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite and allard @xcite , that the pore - surface interface appears locally plane in this asymptotic high - frequency frozen limit .",

    "@xmath113 eventually become much greater than the inertial terms @xmath114 and @xmath115 and the boundary layers extend to the whole fluid .",

    "as explained before , it is only for sufficiently simple geometries that the assumed long - wavelength nature of the considered fields , automatically imply that the microscopic flow - field can be considered divergence - free for the purpose of determining the density ( eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) ) , and likewise , the excess pressure field can be considered gradient - free for the purpose of determining the compressibility .",
    "now , johnson @xmath5 @xmath6 have made the important observation that , because the velocity field is locally divergence - free , the singularities of functions @xmath127 and @xmath64  poles , zeros , and branch points  necessarily are purely imaginary ( see @xcite appendix a ) .",

    "more recently , the strictly decreasing nature of functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 versus real frequency has been shown in elegant manner by a variational formulation making use of the divergence - free nature ( [ d2 ] ) of the microscopic flow fields @xcite .    finally ,",

    "( [ 12]15 ) as to johnson - allard s ( @xmath0 ) .    subsequently , pride @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite , while studying oscillating viscous flow in convergent - divergent channels , found that the simple formula ( [ j14 ] ) may significantly underestimate the imaginary part of dynamic permeability @xmath77 at low frequencies . to remedy this , they proposed different modified formulas .",
    "in essence these are formulas capable to account for the exact value of parameter @xmath15 , which , in such channels , may be significantly increased as compared to johnson s .",
    "notwithstanding , this parameter @xmath15 is not singled out in pride .",
    "its identification by eq .",
    "( [ lfp2 ] ) ( see @xcite and lafargeth ) shows that it is constructed like the tortuosity @xmath155 , this time for the ` poiseuille'-like velocity pattern .",
    "therefore it is a measure of ` disorder ' of the ` poiseuille ' flow , and as such it is increased not only by the convergent - divergent mechanism considered by pride @xmath5 @xmath6 , but also , @xmath156 , by irregularities in the distribution of solid inclusions leading to the existence of privileged flow paths .",
    "whatever the cause of the enhanced ` poiseuille disorder ' , a significant increase of factor @xmath157 as compared to johnson s value @xmath158 , will make it more necessary to modify johnson s formula .",
    "similar formal considerations hold true also , @xmath159 @xmath160 , for thermal effects and the function @xmath161 . here also , a significant increase of @xmath162 may result when replacing a regular distribution of solid inclusions by an irregular one ( which leaves unchanged the thermal characteristic length @xmath163 ) .",
    "now , among the different modifications proposed in @xcite the first was the simplest one , capable to yield the exact first two terms at high and low frequencies , and simultaneously , to automatically fulfil the condition on singularities whatever the values of parameters @xmath67 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath8 , and @xmath7 . finally , this formula was expressed by lafarge in terms of the parameter @xmath165 and the same description was then immediately transferable to thermal effects .",
    "the corresponding pride - lafarge s ( @xmath1 ) model formulas are:@xmath166where @xmath150 and @xmath167 are as before , and @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the new shape factors given by , @xmath170    these expressions reduce to @xmath171 s by setting @xmath172 and are simple transformations of the latter : they apply the simple group transformation @xmath173 to the basic johnson s square root function @xmath174 .",
    "two successive applications of the transformation ( with parameters @xmath168 and @xmath50 ) yield another same transformation ( with parameter @xmath175 ) which preserves both low- and high - frequency limits @xmath176 and @xmath177 . in this way",
    "there is some unicity in the @xmath1 modification , which is not extendible in obvious very simple manner .",
    "it must be realized that , as a side result of the strong constraints imposed by the special location of singularities and as long as the geometry is relatively simple , the @xmath1 expressions constructed with one more exact term than @xmath0 s at low frequencies , will also describe in a slightly more accurate manner all of the viscous and thermal relaxation description essentially improves the low frequencies if often made in literature . in reality because of the pole in @xmath56 and the way @xmath178 is related to @xmath179  see ( [ be ] ) , the small departures between @xmath18 and @xmath0 are mainly perceptible in the region of intermediate frequencies . ] .",
    "nevertheless , it should not be hoped that it is possible to gain , by means of this description , very meaningful information on the frozen parameters @xmath180 and @xmath181 .    if the model expressions ( [ 14]-[15b ] ) were exact , the comparison of their high - frequency expansions with the exact ones ( [ hf ] )",

    "<S> time domain responses of porous media have been studied by some authors , but generally the possible descriptions are given in the frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper , limited to materials with rigid skeleton considered as equivalent fluids , is to compare in time domain different descriptions by johnson - allard ( @xmath0 ) as well as by pride - lafarge ( @xmath1 ) , with : @xmath2 ) some analytical approximate formulas based upon asymptotic high - frequency expansion ; @xmath3 ) the exact formula by zwikker and kosten for the case of cylindrical pores . </S>",
    "<S> the paper starts with a construction analysis of the models ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , a so - far overlooked decay length @xmath4 describing a high - frequency attenuation - without - distortion effect is identified in terms of brown s tortuosity , johnson s and allard s known characteristic viscous and thermal lengths , and two , unknown in general , characteristic viscous and thermal surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical computation of the green s function is done by fft , with some precautions , because of the importance of the higher frequencies on the response shape : the substraction of the diffusive ( low frequencies ) approximation largely improves the results of the fft . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 description is shown to be the best full - frequency general model with remaining small discrepancies due to unsatisfactory account of the mentioned surface - parameters .    </S>",
