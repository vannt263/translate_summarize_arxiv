    "inflationary cosmology is one of the most brilliant ideas proposed to resolve some of the fundamental shortcomings of the old big bang model ( @xcite ) .",
    "it solves the flatness and horizon problems , it explains the absence of exotic relics ( predicted by grand unified theories ) and it even provides an explanation for the large - scale structure of the universe , which is linked to the quantum fluctuations of the field of inflation @xmath11 .",
    "the implications of inflation have been found to be consistent with observations , in particular the large - scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe .",
    "another impressive success of inflation has been the observation of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropies of the cmb .",
    "the generation of primordial gravitational waves ( pgw ) during inflation is a key prediction that may be proven true in the near future .",
    "there are other outstanding problems in astrophysics and cosmology that could potentially have a solution in the context of inflation .",
    "one of them is the presence of large - scale , very weak magnetic fields , observed in all kinds of galaxies and cluster of galaxies at wide range of redshifts .",
    "there is even some evidence for the presence of the magnetic fields in the very low density intergalactic medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic dynamo is a known mechanism for the amplification of magnetic fields to the observed levels in galaxies , but it requires a seed field ( @xcite ) .",
    "so far , no convincing argument has been found for the origin of these magnetic fields , and a distinct possibility is that they are of cosmological ( primordial ) origin .",
    "the mechanism for generating these so - called primordial magnetic fields ( pmf ) is still under intense debate ( @xcite ) . the latest constraints on the strength of pmf ( @xmath12 )",
    "have been set recently by planck 2015 ( @xcite ) .    in the context of pmf ,",
    "one of the most interesting and simplest models is the @xmath13(@xcite ) .",
    "part of its attractiveness is that it is stable under perturbations .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein . ) also , it can lead to a scale invariant spectrum of pmf ( @xcite ) , an important characteristic that would explain why magnetic fields are detected nearly at all scales in the universe .",
    "the main difficulties with this model are the backreaction problem , where the scale of the energy of the electric field associated with the pmf can exceed the scale of inflation itself ( @xcite ) , and the strong coupling between electromagnetic fields and charged matter at the beginning of inflation ( @xcite ) .",
    "a few different avenues have been proposed to overcome these two problems , but they need more investigations in order to form a robust model , self - consistent in both classical and quantum regimes .",
    "the strong coupling problem is of quantum origin and may lead to a huge coupling between the electromagnetic fields and charged particles .",
    "for example , for inflation with @xmath14 e - foldings , the electron effective charge would be @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the theory is no longer valid in such an excessively strong coupling regime(@xcite ) .",
    "the lagrangian of a scalar ( inflaton ) field @xmath16 coupled to the gauged electromagnetic vector field @xmath17 can be written ( @xcite ) as , @xmath18 } , \\end{split } \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] where , @xmath19 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath20 is the determinant of the spacetime metric @xmath21 .",
    "the first term in the lagrangian is the standard kinetic part of the scalar field , and the second term,@xmath22 , is the potential .    whereas the lagrangian of a pure electromagnetic field is of the form @xmath23 , in eq.([eqn1 ] )",
    "we couple it to the scalar field through the unspecified function @xmath24 .",
    "the main reason behind this coupling is to break the conformal symmetry of electromagnetism and hence prevent the dilution of the seed of magnetic field as it is generated in the inflation era . at the end of inflation , the coupling function , @xmath25 , to retrieve the conformal electromagnetism .",
    "the last condition is important to decide the form of coupling function and to study pmf in post - inflationary phases .",
    "the standard model of inflation makes use of a single scalar field and a simple potential , such as a quadratic function , @xmath26 , quartic , @xmath27 ( @xcite ) , higgs potential , @xmath28 , ( @xcite ) and the exponential potential , @xmath29 ( @xcite ) . the last one is used in ( @xcite ) to find the magnetic and electric spectrum in the @xmath13 model .",
    "these models became more interesting after wmap ( @xcite ) and planck ( @xcite ) .",
    "as a result , the preferred potential class is the so called `` plateau inflation '' , at which @xmath30 .    in this paper ,",
    "the @xmath13 model is investigated for large field inflation lfi , for all possible values of the model parameters , in the same way as done by ( @xcite ) .",

    "the reduced planck mass , @xmath33 , will be taken as @xmath34 for the computations .",
    "hence , the potential of lfi can be written ( @xcite ) as @xmath35 where , @xmath36 is the model parameter and @xmath37 is the normalization of the potential . from the amplitude of cmb anisotropies , @xmath38 ( @xcite ) .    in section 2",
    "we present the slow roll inflation formulation for both simple de sitter model of expansion and the more general power law expansion in the context of lfi . in section 3 ,",
    "the pmf and associated electric fields are computed in lfi for all possible values of @xmath36 . in section 4 , a summary and discussion of the results",
    "is presented .",
    "during inflation we assume the electromagnetic field to be negligible compared to the scalar field , @xmath16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the equation of motion derived from ( [ eqn1 ] ) for the scalar field can be written as , @xmath39 where , @xmath40 , is the hubble parameter as a function of cosmic time , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "the over dot indicates differentiation with respect to cosmic time , and @xmath43 .",
    "the friedman equation can be obtained from the einstein field equations ( assuming a friedmann - robertson - walker universe ) , which yields @xmath44 - \\frac{k}{{{a^2 } } } + \\frac{{\\rm{\\lambda } } } { 3 } , \\label{eqn4}\\ ] ] where , @xmath45 , is the 3-curvature index for a flat , closed or an open universe , and @xmath46 , is the cosmological constant .",
    "the last two terms can be neglected in the inflation era .",
    "also , under slow roll approximation , one can neglect the second derivative in ( [ eqn3 ] ) , which leads to the attractor condition , @xmath47 defining the slow roll parameters of inflation in terms of the potential ( @xcite ) , of a single inflation field for lfi ( [ eqn2 ] ) , @xmath48 @xmath49 these can also be written in terms of the hubble parameter , @xmath50 the relation between the two formalisms ( @xcite ) can be written as @xmath51    all of the above parameters are assumed to be very small during the slow roll inflation,@xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , inflation ends when the values of @xmath53 .",

    "we adopt planck , 2015 pivot scale , @xmath92 , and in most of the cases we use the upper limit of hubble parameter in the inflationary era , @xmath93 , ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , it is worthwhile to investigate both cases ; the de sitter , and the more realistic power law model described by eq.([eqn11 ] ) .      the de sitter model is the zeroth order approximation , and does not have graceful exit from inflation ( @xcite ) .",
    "but it can be assumed as a valid approximation for most of the period of inflation . in conformal time , @xmath57 , eq.([eqn5 ] ) can be written as , @xmath94 where , @xmath95 .",

    "both cases will be studied in section 3 , to derive the coupling function @xmath109 and then calculate the electromagnetic spectra in the de sitter case of inflation .      to have a more optimal slow roll analysis that has a smooth exit from inflation",
