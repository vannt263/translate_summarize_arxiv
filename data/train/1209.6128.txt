    "fluctuations of the spatial distribution of the atomic potential give origin to the zero - temperature resistivity of crystalline solids . in order to study in detail the impact of fluctuations of the atomic potential on charge transport it is appropriate to neglect all less important agents influencing the response of the electron gas on external electric perturbations and to investigate only scatterings of free electrons on random impurities .",

    "the cpa is essentially unable to go beyond the semi - classical description of transport properties qualitatively captured by the boltzmann equation .",
    "this inability is due to the fact that the cpa does not include vertex corrections to the one - electron ( drude - type ) electrical conductivity.@xcite in the simplest single - band tight - binding model the electrical conductivity at zero temperature in @xmath0 direction can be represented in the cpa via the averaged one - electron propagator at the fermi surface @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electron group velocity in direction @xmath0 and superscript @xmath3 denotes the retarded part of the averaged one - electron propagator .",

    "we can see that in the strong - disorder limit the conductivity from the renormalized diffusion constant @xmath136 matches the approximated one from the kubo formula , while the conductivity from the bare diffusion constant @xmath134 is quite off for all disorder strengths .",

    "we presented in this paper an approximate non - perturbative scheme for including non - local vertex corrections to the mean - field vertex from the coherent potential approximation .",
    "the construction is a partial resummation of an expansion in the off - diagonal one - electron propagator from cpa that includes the leading - order non - local correction to the irreducible electron - hole irreducible vertex . after a simplification in the momentum dependence of the integral kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation with multiple scatterings we derived an explicit representation for the electrical conductivity , eq .  , that remains non - negative irrespectively of how strong the disorder is .",
    "we explicitly demonstrated that this expression produces reliable results for the electrical conductivity , in particular in the strong - disorder regime , and it qualitatively correctly mimics the behavior of the averaged conductivity in intermediate and weak - disorder regimes .",
    "an important aspect of the derived approach is that we made the approximation for the non - local part of the two - particle vertex compatible with the local mean - field one - electron self - energy .",
    "it means that it is not necessary to correct the self - energy by adding non - local terms in a cumbersome way to assess the averaged conductivity with vertex corrections .",
    "the only modification to be done in the electron - hole vertex is to rescale the local mean - field vertex @xmath83 by a factor so that to restore the diffusion pole in the electron - hole correlation function .",
    "this scaling effectively reduces the disorder effect in the regions where the vertex corrections to the conductivity overweigh the drude term and one needs to apply a non - perturbative approach to correct this deficiency .",
    "our construction does exactly this with a minimum effort and no changes in the mean - field one - electron self - energy .",
    "it can hence be used to extend the standard mean - field one - electron approximation by including leading two - particle vertex corrections to the electrical conductivity without breaking consistency and the fundamental physical laws .",
    "the approximate construction is enough simple so that it may find application in the calculation of transport properties of real disordered materials beyond the model level presented here .",
