    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) exhibits structure over a wide range of size scales . in particular , so - called  small scale structure \" , ranging in size from a few hundred kilometers up to parsec - scales , has been uncovered by a variety of observational techniques over the last few decades .",
    "this structure manifests itself in neutral , ionized and molecular form and appears to be over - pressured with respect to the surrounding medium .",
    "small - scale atomic structure was first revealed by a vlbi hi absorption study towards the extragalactic source 3c 147 @xcite , which showed au - scale variations in hi opacity .",
    "other techniques to probe these variations include the use of optical tracers ( particularly na i d lines ) against binary stars and globular clusters ( e.g. lauroesch et al . 1998 ) , multi - epoch hi absorption measurements against pulsars ( e.g. frail et al .",
    "1994 ) , and mapping of hi optical depth against continuum sources ( e.g. faison et al .",
    "small - scale molecular structure is revealed by observations of time - variability of molecular lines seen in absorption against quasars ( e.g. marscher et al .",
    "1993 ) , and small - scale ionized structures are probed using pulsar scintillation ( reviewed by rickett 1990 ) .    at present , no single theory is able to account for all forms of small - scale structure . the challenge is to explain the observed large ranges in pressure and temperature ( e.g. jenkins & tripp 2001 ) in the context of a dynamic ism .",
    "the ism is often described by a multi - phase model that includes the effects of supernova explosions and x - ray ionization ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "a feature of this paradigm is that the various phases are in approximate pressure equilibrium .",
    "however , it is now thought that turbulence has a significant role in creating a more complex medium at small scales , featuring large contrasts in density , pressure and temperature ( e.g. kritsuk & norman 2002 ; koyama & inutsuka 2002 ; audit & hennebelle 2005 ; gazol et al . 2005 ; heitsch et al .",
    "2005 ; mac low et al .",
    "a major obstacle is that the fundamental nature of small - scale structure is not understood .",
    "the discovery of  tiny \" , low column density clouds ( e.g. braun & kanekar 2005 ; stanimirovi & heiles 2005 ) suggests it could be in the form of discrete objects , but it is also argued that it is part of a power spectrum resulting from turbulent processes ( e.g. deshpande 2000 ) .",
    "the pervasiveness of small - scale structure is also unknown .",
    "for example , a multi - epoch pulsar study by frail et al .",
    "( 1994 ) suggested that @xmath0 of the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) is in the form of au - scale structure .",
    "however , more recent pulsar work ( e.g. johnston et al .",
    "2003 ; stanimirovi et al .",
    "2003 ) shows structure to be more sporadic and argues that previous ",
    "detections \" were likely the result of systematic calibration errors .",
    "vlba observations towards 3c 138 @xcite suggest the filling factor of atomic structure in the cnm is @xmath1 % .",
    "thus , it is especially complicated to assess the degree to which small - scale structure is universal in the ism since it is difficult to detect .    to make progress in understanding structure generation",
    "it is important to assess the relative roles of dyamical processes and those involving thermal conduction and evaporation .",
    "for example , slavin ( 2007 ) has argued that evaporation is unimportant in dynamically active regions but that it may become dominant in quiescent regions . in this paper",
    "we examine the stability properties of evaporation and condensation fronts separating two media of different temperatures and densities . the thermal - type corrugational instability results from perturbations that are periodic on a surface of discontinuity , causing it to wrinkle .",
    "its character has been discussed in the context of shock waves ( dyakov 1954 ; landau & lifshitz 1987 ) and combustion @xcite .",
    "the instability was first applied to combustion in type ia supernovae by bychkov & liberman ( 1995 ) . in a study of the structure and stability of cnm",
    "/ wnm phase transition layers inoue et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter iik06 ) showed that evaporation fronts are hydrodynamically unstable to corrugational deformations , whereas condensation fronts are hydrodynamically stable .",
    "it was also suggested that such perturbations could generate turbulence in the nonlinear regime within a dynamical time of the ism .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic numerical simulations @xcite suggest that the formation of filaments and voids in a multiphase ism induce turbulence that can saturate the nonlinear thermal instability .",
    "our primary interest here is in the potential of the corruguational instability to generate structure .",
    "the alfvn velocity in the neutral ism is at least 10 - 100 times larger than the flow speed of fronts .",
    "therefore , magnetic fields will significantly affect their dynamics . in this work",
    "we discuss the modifications to the hydrodynamic analysis for the scenario of a magnetic field orthogonal to a front , and concentrate on the sub - alfvnic regime as the astrophysically relevant case .",
    "the linear effects of magnetic fields on combustion fronts in the context of supernovae were considered by dursi ( 2004 ) . in that work",
    "it was shown that super - alfvnic flames are not significantly affected by a magnetic field , whereas in the sub - alfvnic case the instability can be greatly suppressed .",
    "dursi s work is equivalent to our evaporation front setup , so in this paper we extend the analysis to condensation fronts .",
    "we discuss the physical picture of fronts in  2 and present the linear stability analysis in  3 .",
    "mode analyses and dispersion relations for the super - alfvnic and sub - alfvnic regimes are presented in  4 .",
    "the physical mechanism of the instability is discussed in more detail in  5 .",
    "we apply our findings to the neutral ism in  6 , and summarize our results and mention future work in  7 . in the appendices we present the derivation of the dispersion relation for the magnetized entropy - vortex wave and compare our method with that of dursi ( 2004 ) , to allow ease of comparison between the supernova and ism applications .",
    "this paper is the first in a series exploring the linear and nonlinear effects of magnetic field strength and orientation on the corrugational instability .",
    "we consider the physical setup of a phase transition layer ( or front ) separating two uniform media of different densities and temperatures in a 2-d plane - parallel geometry .",
    "these phases result from the balance of radiative heating and cooling due to cosmic rays and external radiation fields @xcite .",
    "the nature of a front depends on the pressure .",
    "there exists a  saturation pressure \" such that heating and cooling are balanced inside a static front ( zeldovich & pikelner 1969 ; penston & brown 1970 ) .",
    "an evaporation front exists if the saturation pressure exceeds the external pressure such that there is net heating across the transition layer . in a condensation front",
    "the saturation pressure is exceeded by the external pressure such that there is net cooling across the layer .",
    "the physical setup is illustrated in figure [ biik ] .",
    "we assume the front is located in the plane @xmath2 with the ambient flow parallel to the @xmath3-axis and select the reference frame so that it moves with the front .",
    "a uniform magnetic field is orthogonal to the front , but has no effect on its structure since it does not exert any force and does not modify thermal conduction in the direction of the temperature gradient .",
    "we assume the perturbations on each side of the front are incompressible , since the ambient flow speed is subsonic ( iik06 ) .",
    "the thickness of a front ( the field length , @xmath4 ) is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the temperature - dependent thermal conductivity and @xmath7 is the net cooling rate @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath4 has the values @xmath8 pc and @xmath9 pc for the cnm and wnm , respectively ( iik06 ) . in order to include all relevant physical processes one must consider perturbations with wavelengths both larger and smaller than @xmath4 . for wavelengths larger than the front thickness",
    "the transition layer is treated as discontinuous and perturbations of the fluid dynamical variables are important .",
    "this allows for a straightforward analysis but neglects the effects of thermal conduction and thermal stability ( iik06 ) . to remedy",
    "this one must also consider corrugations smaller than the front thickness for which perturbations of the thermodynamic variables are important . in this work",
    "we only discuss the long wavelength , discontinous front approximation .",
    "the roles of heating , cooling , and thermal conduction in front stability will be the subject of future study .",
    "we perform a linear stability analysis for fronts undergoing corrugational deformation when subject to an orthogonal magnetic field .",
    "we choose a similar method to that of iik06 , rather than that used by dursi ( 2004 ) .",
    "we provide comments throughout this paper on the commonalities of all three approaches , with a more detailed comparison provided in appendix b. it should be noted that dursi s combustion front is equivalent to our evaporation front setup , in the sense that the downstream density is lower than the upstream density .",
    "our work is thus an extension of his in providing the stability analysis for a condensation front .",
    "we begin by linearizing the equations of continuity , momentum conservation , and induction in the incompressible approximation to obtain @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12 , \\label{bind}\\ ] ]    where subscripts  u \" and  d \" refer to upstream and downstream , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 represent density , velocity , pressure , and magnetic field , and perturbed quantities are denoted by the use of  @xmath17 \" .",
    "we assume ideal mhd and neglect diffusivity .",
    "we take the front to be in the plane @xmath18 and assume perturbations in the ( * k * , * b * ) plane of the form @xmath19 $ ] , so that unstable modes have @xmath20 . substituting the form of the perturbations into equations ( [ cont ] ) , ( [ mom ] ) and ( [ bind ] ) , and taking @xmath21 ( i.e. orthogonal to the front ) yields the following equations : @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    the perturbations are decomposed into two surface waves that are localized to the front , and two magnetized entropy - vortex waves that are advected by the flow .",
    "we adopt a notation similar to that of iik06 and denote the surface waves upstream and downstream of the front by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with dispersion relations given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the magnetized entropy - vortex waves are represented by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "their dispersion relations are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the alfvn speed is given by @xmath35 .",
    "the nature of these magnetized entropy - vortex waves and the derivation of their dispersion relations are discussed further in appendix a.    the directions of propagation of the magnetized entropy - vortex waves depend on whether the flow is super- or sub - alfvnic . in the super - alfvnic case",
    "no magnetized entropy - vortex waves can propagate upstream , so @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both downstream perturbations . in the sub - alfvnic regime @xmath31 propagates upstream whereas @xmath32 is a downstream perturbation . in ",
    "4 we derive separate characteristic equations for each regime .    the @xmath36component velocity , magnetic field , and pressure perturbations can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath37component velocity perturbations upstream and downstream of the front , using equations ( [ in1 ] ) - ( [ in2 ] ) .",
    "we represent perturbed quantities as sums of the surface waves and magnetized entropy - vortex waves : @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42   \\delta v_y^{(\\alpha ) } , \\label{down}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 corresponds to the different types of perturbation : ( -),(+),(s- ) , and ( s+ ) .",
    "these quantities are computed upstream and downstream of the front , with the appropriate perturbations substituted for @xmath44 , depending on whether the flow is super - alfvnic or sub - alfvnic .    to proceed , we require the jump conditions across the front .",
    "the normal and tangential unit vectors are given by : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the front displacement .",
    "these are used to compute the velocity perturbations normal and tangential to the front : @xmath47 ( iik06 ) .",

    "following iik06 , we modify this condition by assuming that the structure of the front is unchanged by a perturbation such that : @xmath52 this is equivalent to the condition used by dursi ( 2004 ) that both sides of the front travel with the same velocity ( @xmath53 = 0 $ ] in our notation ) .",

    ", we obtain the characteristic equation of the system .",
    "this is written in the form : @xmath61 where the matrix @xmath62 is derived from the jump conditions and @xmath63 to obtain the dispersion relation governing the perturbations we set the determinant of @xmath62 equal to zero and solve for @xmath64 .",
    "in this section we provide the characteristic equations for super - alfvnic and sub - alfvnic fronts , in terms of the density jump across the front , @xmath65 , and the ratio of the downstream alfvn speed to the downstream flow speed , @xmath66 .",
    "super - alfvnic fronts have @xmath67 and @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 on the upstream side and @xmath70 on the downstream side .",
    "sub - alfvnic fronts have @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 on the upstream side and @xmath74 on the dowstream side . a third regime , called  trans - alfvnic \"",
    "@xcite , may be identified in which the flow speed exceeds the alfvn speed on one side , but is less than the alfvn speed on the other side , i.e. a takes a value between @xmath75 and unity ( @xmath76 for evaporation , @xmath77 for condensation ) .",
    "the front behavior in this regime can not be found using the methods discussed in this work , as it is possible for more waves to propagate than there are boundary conditions constraining them , and thus no unique solution exists for the initial - value problem @xcite .",
    "we argue in  6 that the sub - alfvnic regime is of most relevance to the interstellar medium , so do not provide any further discussion of the trans - alfvnic regime .",
    "the stability properties for both front types in the various regimes are summarized in table 1 .",
    "if a front is super - alfvnic no entropy - vortex waves can propagate upstream , so the total upstream y - velocity perturbation is simply given by the upstream surface wave : @xmath78 downstream , the total y - velocity perturbation is given by : @xmath79 the velocity , magnetic field , and pressure perturbations on each side of the front are written in terms of these total y - velocity perturbations , and substituted into the jump conditions . collecting terms in each perturbation ,",
    "the matrix , * m * , of the characteristic equation for the super - alfvnic case is given by : @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "taking the determinant of this matrix yields the dispersion relation : @xmath82[-i r_d^3 \\omega_d^3 + \\omega^3 + i r_d^2 \\omega_d ( \\omega_d^2 + 3 i \\omega_d \\omega + \\omega^2)]}{a r_d \\omega_d ( r_d \\omega_d - i \\omega)(\\omega_d + i \\omega ) \\omega } = 0\\ ] ] this can be simplified by removing two  trivial \" modes that do not cause a displacement of the front .",
    "these modes are given by @xmath83 .",
    "factoring these out , the dispersion relation can be written as : @xmath84 in the limit @xmath85 the hydrodynamic dispersion relation of iik06 is recovered .",
    "the super - alfvnic stability behavior is similar to that of the hydrodynamic case ; condensation fronts remain stable while an unstable mode is present in evaporation fronts . as found by dursi ( 2004 ) ,",
    "the growth rate of this unstable mode is slightly enhanced .",
    "we discuss the physical origin of this behavior in  5 .      for sub - alfvnic fronts the upstream y - velocity perturbation",
    "is composed of a surface wave and entropy - vortex wave : @xmath86 and the downstream y - velocity perturbation is given by : @xmath87 the matrix , * m * , of the characteristic equation for the sub - alfvnic case is : @xmath88 there are two trivial modes , given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which do not displace the front . factoring these out , the dispersion relation may be written as : @xmath91 \\omega^2 - \\frac{r_d \\omega_d^2}{1+r_d}[1 + 2a(a-1 ) + 2 \\sqrt r_d ( a-2 ) + r_d ] \\omega - i r_d^{3/2 } \\omega_d^3 \\frac{1-r_d}{1+r_d } = 0 \\label{sub}\\ ] ]    the stability properties are the opposite of what is obtained in the super - alfvnic case : the evaporation front is stabilized , but an unstable mode exists in condensation fronts , the growth rate of which decreases with increasing magnetic field strength . for very large magnetic field strength , as is expected for the ism ( see  6 ) , the growth rate is approximately : @xmath92 this can be written in more physical terms if we assume that material crosses the front in a time of order the cooling time , given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the cooling rate . for our calculations",
    "we use the cooling function of iik06 , in which @xmath95 ergs s@xmath96 corresponds to thermal equilibrium . assuming the most unstable scale is twice the field length ( as is found by iik06 ) , the growth rate is given by : @xmath97 the growth rates of the unstable condensation mode in the sub - alfvnic regime are plotted as a function of a for various @xmath98 in figure [ growth ] .",
    "the role of the density jump across the front in driving the instability decreases in importance with increasing a.    we have also examined the eigenfunctions of the sub - alfvnic matrix to assess the contributions of the various perturbations .",
    "the amplitudes of the entropy - vortex waves relative to the surface waves are of order @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the instability produces very little disturbance upstream or downstream and remains localized to the front .",
    "to investigate the mechanism of the corrugational instability we begin with the simple case of a front in the hydrodynamic limit , in which evaporation fronts are unstable whereas condensation fronts are stable .",
    "since the normal component of the velocity perturbation is zero on both sides of the front , we use equation ( [ jump ] ) to write : @xmath100 if @xmath101 is a positive , real number , as is the case for evaporation fronts , the x - velocity perturbation will reinforce the displacement of the front and continue to drive the instability . in condensation fronts",
    "@xmath102 opposes the displacement and thus stabilizes the front . since all growing modes have positive imaginary @xmath64 , this argument is true in general for all unstable fronts , whether super - alfvnic or sub - alfvnic .",
    "streamline curvature can also be used as a diagnostic of stability , as has been done for flame fronts in type ia supernovae @xcite . in that work",
    "it was argued that in regions where",
    "the streamlines  fan out \" , the local flow velocity into the front is reduced and the front can propagate further ahead .",
    "we demonstrate this analytically , by calculating the angle formed between a given streamline and the front normal , to first order in the perturbation amplitude , using : @xmath103 in the hydrodynamic case , @xmath104 is continuous across the front , so we have @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "evaporation fronts have @xmath107 , so the downstream angle is smaller than the upstream angle so the streamlines bend towards the front normal . in the case of a condensation front @xmath108",
    "so the streamlines bend away from the normal .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ streamiik ] . in regions where the streamlines diverge",
    "the @xmath3-velocity perturbation is negative ( @xmath109 ) and so the amplitude of the corrugation is enhanced .    in the case of a magnetic field orthogonal to the front",
    ", this analysis is more complicated , since the condition on @xmath104 is changed .",
    "we derive it using the y - component of the linearized induction equation ( [ yind ] ) and the tangential component of the linearized momentum equation ( [ tmom ] ) .",
    "we assume @xmath110 , which can be justified _ a posteriori _ , and write the tangential momentum balance condition as : @xmath111 upstream and downstream angles may be compared by writing equation ( [ tanmom ] ) as : @xmath112 such that @xmath113 in the super - alfvnic regime we consider a to be small compared to both 1 and @xmath98 , so equation ( [ bang ] ) becomes @xmath114 . if @xmath115 , the change in streamline angle across the front is increased by the magnetic field , so the instability is enhanced in evaporation fronts , as noted in  4.1 .. for @xmath116 the angle decreases across the front so condensation fronts are stable . in the sub - alfvnic regime ,",
    "in which @xmath117 we obtain @xmath118 $ ] , which is consistent with the stabilization of evaporation fronts and the slight destabilization of condensation fronts .",
    "thus , the streamline picture explains the regimes of stability and instability found from the dispersion relations given by equations ( [ super ] ) and ( [ sub ] ) .",
    "the structure of fronts is calculated in iik06 by solving the energy equation while assuming thermal equilibrium at infinity . in future work we will study the effects of magnetic fields on front structure , but for now we simply use their results to examine the growth rates of unstable modes for parameters appropriate to the neutral ism .",
    "the magnetic field strength parameter , @xmath119 , can be written in terms of the upstream gas conditions as : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the molar gas constant , @xmath122 is the mean molecular weight ( assumed to be unity ) , @xmath123 is the temperature in the upstream gas , and @xmath124 is the upstream pressure . the parameters corresponding to examples of steady state evaporation and condensation fronts , derived from the front calculations of iik06 , are presented in table 2 .",
    "both types of front are sub - alfvnic , with their dynamics dominated by the magnetic field . in this regime evaporation fronts are stable , so we now calculate the growth rate of the unstable condensation mode . using equation ( [ cool ] ) and the parameters given in table 2 , we find a growth timescale @xmath125",
    ". this would imply that the corrugational instability is essentially stabilized in the neutral ism .    however , if condensation proceeds more rapidly the instability may grow within a dynamical time of the ism .",
    "inoue et al . ( 2007 ) argue that the condensation speed during the growth of a thermal instability that can generate clouds is of order @xmath126 km s@xmath96 .",
    "if we use this velocity with the other parameters in table 2 we obtain a @xmath127 .",
    "assuming the most unstable scale is of order @xmath9 pc we find a growth timescale @xmath128 myr .",
    "this would imply that the corrugational instability has a significant effect on cloud dynamics .    since we have neglected the thickness of the front in this analysis we can not provide further comments on the physical scale of the instability or its growth time .",
    "the full significance of the unstable condensation mode and the actual speed of the condensation process will only become apparent through completing the finite front analysis and nonlinear simulations .",
    "we have shown that for the case of a magnetic field orthogonal to a phase transition layer unstable modes can exist in both evaporation and condensation fronts , depending on whether the flow is super - alfvnic or sub - alfvnic .",
    "this is in contrast to the hydrodynamic case in which an unstable mode only occurs in evaporation fronts .",
    "we demonstrated this by deriving linear dispersion relations , given by equations ( [ super ] ) and ( [ sub ] ) , and from an analysis of streamline geometry near the corrugated front .    in the super - alfvnic case the instability in evaporation fronts",
    "is enhanced from the hydrodynamic case , which is apparent from the increase in streamline bending . in the sub - alfvnic case evaporation fronts",
    "are stabilized and it is the condensation front that is unstable .",
    "a simple formula for the maximum growth rate of the condensation front instability is given by equation ( [ cool ] ) , from which it is shown that under conditions appropriate to steady fronts in the neutral ism the growth time is sufficiently long that such systems are effectively stable .",
    "we make the simple argument that the corrugational instability is suppressed by the rigidity of the magnetic field .",
    "however , if condensation proceeds sufficiently rapidly the growth timescale may become less than the dynamical time , such that the instability is important for cloud formation dynamics .",
    "forthcoming papers in this series will consider perturbations smaller than the front thickness for both orthogonal and tangential magnetic field orientations .",
    "the full significance of the unstable modes will only be revealed through studies of their nonlinear behavior .",
    "numerical simulations will be performed to assess the nonlinear characteristics of the instability and its potential for generating small - scale structure in the ism .",

    "we compare his method with ours and summarize his findings , to allow comparison between the ism and supernova applications .",
    "the physical setup of the supernova flame front is similar to that shown by the left side diagram in figure [ biik ] ; one should consider  phase i \" to be unburned fuel and  phase ii \" to be burned ash .",

    "<S> we consider the scenario of a magnetic field orthogonal to a front separating two media of different temperatures and densities , such as cold and warm neutral interstellar gas , in a 2-d plane - parallel geometry . </S>",
    "<S> a linear stability analysis is performed to assess the behavior of both evaporation and condensation fronts when subject to incompressible , corrugational perturbations with wavelengths larger than the thickness of the front .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the behavior of fronts in both super - alfvnic and sub - alfvnic flows . since the propagation speed of fronts is slow in the ism , it is the sub - alfvnic regime that is relevant , and magnetic fields are a significant influence on front dynamics . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we find that evaporation fronts , which are unstable in the hydrodynamic regime , are stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> condensation fronts are unstable , but for parameters typical of the neutral ism the growth rates are so slow that steady state fronts are effectively stable </S>",
    "<S> . however , the instability may become important if condensation proceeds at a sufficiently fast rate .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is the first in a series exploring the linear and nonlinear effects of magnetic field strength and orientation on the corrugational instability , with the ultimate goal of addressing outstanding questions about small - scale ism structure . </S>"
