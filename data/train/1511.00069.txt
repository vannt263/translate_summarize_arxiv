    "-5.0truemm      known from a long time , the problem of the motion of a system of point vortices in interaction presents a particular interest for the study of bidimensional turbulence .",
    "as predicted by onsager ( 1949 ) the study of the thermodynamics of a large system of vortices shows the possibility of temperatures and eddy viscosities ( see e.g. lundgren and pointin 1977 ) .",
    "the case of a small number of vortices was studied , long ago , by lord kelvin and mayer ( 1878 ) .",
    "they used experimental methods to obtain some results on the stability of simple geometric configurations .",
    "recently novikov ( 1975 ) pointed out the interest of the three vortex system as the first elementary interaction process in isotropic turbulence kinetics . using properties of the triangle he was able to solve the problem of three identical vortices .    while this work was under submission , the referees pointed out to us the existence of a paper to appear . in this paper , hassan aref ( march 1979 ) , extending the work of novikov with a symmetry - preserving presentation , qualitatively solved the relative motion of three vortices and undertook a classification of the topology of the phase space ; however , he gave no indication on the nature of the absolute motion and no quantitative results , except for two special cases of great importance which he solved completely : the direct or exchange scattering when two strengths are equal and opposite to the third one , and the self - similar motion of a triple collision or a triple expansion to infinity when both the inertia momentum and the angular momentum vanish .    in this paper ,",
    "we present a method which quantitatively gives the absolute motion in all cases of strengths or initial conditions .",
    "the main idea is to introduce reduced variables with a very simple geometrical interpretation and whose number matches the number of degrees of freedom of the system . for three vortices , this can be done by defining one complex variable @xmath0 which characterizes the shape of the triangle . knowing the motion of @xmath0 , which happens to be periodic , is then sufficient to derive the behaviour of any physically interesting variable .",
    "we thus have obtained detailed results , which resort mainly to fluid mechanics and partly to the field of differentiable dynamical systems .    in the first part",
    ", we describe the problem , introduce the reduced motion and discuss its advantages and inconvenients . in the second part",
    ", we give the general solution : generically , i.e. for arbitrary strengths and initial positions , the absolute motion of any given vortex is the product of a periodic motion of period @xmath1 by a uniform rotation or , stated in other words , the motion is periodic when referred to uniformly rotating axes centered at the center of vorticity ; in the case of a vortex plasma ( zero total strength ) , the uniform rotation is merely replaced by a uniform translation . due to its frequent occurrence in nature",
    ", we give special consideration to the case of two or three equal strengths : in a given domain of initial conditions , vortices with equal strengths have the same motion , up to a shift of @xmath2 or @xmath3 in time and a rotation in space .",
    "the third part , following the smale s method of study of a differentiable dynamical system , is devoted to the finding of the bifurcation set , i.e. the set of values of the invariants for which the nature of the motion changes .",
    "this reduces to the finding of the relative equilibria , which are shown to be of two types , the same than those of the three body problem of celestial mechanics : two equilateral triangles and one or three colinear configurations .",
    "the number and stability of these relative equilibria are discussed , thus leading to a separation of the strengths space in three principal domains where the sets of orbits are topologically different ; an important result is that , whatever be the strengths domain , the phase space is always multiconnected ; for strengths on the boundaries of these domains , the motion must be studied separately for it presents special features .    in the fourth part",
    ", we study the absolute motion whenever it differs from the general biperiodic case , i.e. when strengths are on the boundaries of their limiting domains or when initial positions are those of a relative equilibrium . at a relative equilibrium",
    "the motion is a rigid body rotation . otherwise two new generic motions are found .",
    "first , for strengths such that the angular momentum vanishes , the vortices can go to infinity in a spiral motion with a fixed asymptotic shape of the triangle ; there even exists a spiral motion ending in a triple collision in a finite time , but it is nongeneric since it happens only for a zero value of the inertia momentum .",
    "second , when two strengths are opposite , besides the doubly periodic motion an elastic scattering can occur in which a vortex doublet is diffused by the third vortex ; if moreover the third vortex has the strength of one of the two others , a third generic motion exists which is an exchange scattering .",
    "the fifth part consists in formally examining the behaviour of the thermodynamical quantities , of course meaningless for this integrable system , that onsager defined for a large number of vortices ; the volume of the phase space is found to be equal to the period of the relative motion ; among the features which could be indicative for a large number of vortices is a possible lack of ergodicity due to a multiple connexity of the phase space .",
    "we consider three point vortices @xmath4 @xmath5 in a plane with strengths @xmath6 and given initial positions .",
    "their motion is ruled by the first order system : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and the bar denotes the complex conjugation .",
    "this system is equivalent to the set of hamilton equations for the hamiltonian : @xmath9 \\ell}}\\kappa_{j}\\kappa_{\\ell}\\enskip{\\rm log}|z_{j}-z_{\\ell}|,\\ ] ] in the conjugate variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 sign @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; therefore @xmath14 is an invariant and remains equal to the energy @xmath15 .",
    "the invariance of @xmath14 under translation and rotation yields two other invariants : @xmath16 & & i=\\sum_{j}\\kappa_{j}|z_{j}|^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which poincar called inertia momentum .",
    "in fact we shall use , instead of @xmath17 , the invariant @xmath18 \\ell}}\\kappa_{j}\\kappa_{\\ell}|z_{j}-z_{\\ell}|^{2}=(\\kappa_{1}+\\kappa_{2}+\\kappa_{3})i-|b|^{2},\\ ] ] which depends only on the relative positions of the vortices .",
    "there are @xmath19 remaining degrees of freedom and we suppose the problem to be nondegenerate : @xmath20 .      since a hamiltonian system with @xmath23 variables is integrable in the sense of liouville when it has @xmath24 independent invariants in involution , the three vortex system @xmath25 is therefore integrable ( poincar , 1893 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to integrate it .",
    "let us remark that this problem is not affected by the adjunction of an external velocity field made of a uniform translation and a uniform rotation , since the new equations of motion @xmath26 reduce to the original ones by the change of variables @xmath27      the main idea is to match the number of variables and the number of degrees of freedom of this system , so as to keep the minimum number of independent variables .",
    "for this purpose , let us define a time dependent complex plane @xmath0 in which two of the three point vortices remain fixed .",
    "this can be achieved by the following transformation @xmath28 where 2 and 3 number two vortices whose sum of strengths is nonzero ; the affixes of these two vortices become @xmath29 and @xmath30 under the transformation .",
    "it is clearly seen from the definition how a reduced point is geometrically deduced from an absolute point .",
    "we shall simply note @xmath0 the transformed of  @xmath31 : @xmath32 @xmath0 therefore represents the shape of the triangle , and the inverse transformation is represented by @xmath33 z_{3}=\\frac{(-\\kappa_{2}k-\\kappa_{1}\\zeta)z_{1}+(\\zeta+\\kappa_{2})b}{s\\zeta},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "the reader will have noticed the main disadvantage of the above definition of two reduced coordinates @xmath35 : it does not reflect the invariance of the problem under the permutations of the three elements @xmath36 and therefore every result we can get may be uneasy to interpret .",
    "nevertheless , the advantages are numerous .",
    "first , every physical quantity can systematically be expressed , as we shall soon see , as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath37 only ; moreover , since @xmath0 is invariant under a change of length and @xmath37 extensive in the lengths , such a physical function will quite generally be the product of a function of @xmath0 by a function of @xmath37 and we are going to see that this uncoupling between intensive and extensive variables will enable us to solve the motion not only qualitatively but also quantitatively . secondly , unlike novikov and aref , we do not have to eliminate some unphysical portions of our @xmath0 plane ( which will be seen to be the initial conditions plane ) since every @xmath0 point describes a physical situation .",
    "thirdly , this reduction leaves only the required number of degrees of freedom .      to obtain the absolute motion",
    "we need only determine the evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath38 , since we have the parametric representation ( 5 ) .",
    "provided @xmath39 and @xmath40 do not simultaneously vanish the motions of @xmath38 and @xmath0 are ruled by : @xmath41 2\\pi i\\frac{\\d\\bar{\\zeta}}{\\d t}&=&\\frac{-1}{|kz_{1}-b|^{2 } } \\frac{s|\\zeta|^{2}[\\bar{\\zeta}(\\zeta^{2}+d\\zeta - q)-sk(\\zeta+d ) ] } { ( \\zeta+\\kappa_{2})(\\zeta-\\kappa_{3})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "unless @xmath46 and @xmath44 simultaneously vanish , at least one of the two above equations expresses @xmath47 as a function of @xmath0 and from ( 7 ) we obtain a first order differential system for @xmath0 .",
    "for example if @xmath44 is nonzero the elimination of @xmath38 between ( 7 ) and ( 8) gives : @xmath48 } { j(\\zeta+\\kappa_{2})(\\zeta-\\kappa_{3})}.\\ ] ]    there is no need to solve this system since the equation of the reduced trajectory is given by the straightforward elimination of @xmath38 between ( 8) and  ( 9 ) : @xmath49 this represents in the @xmath0 plane a set of closed orbits , indexed by the non - dimensional variable @xmath50 which is invariant under a change of length or a change of unit of vorticity .",
    "the set of orbits is symmetrical relative to the @xmath51 axis and also , when @xmath52 equals @xmath29 , to the @xmath53 axis .",
    "when two vortices are close to each other , they remain as such and therefore the @xmath0 curves are near to circles in the vicinity of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "figures  [ fig2 ] to [ fig6 ] show examples of the @xmath0 plane .",
    "since there is in general no stationary point on the orbit , the reduced motion is periodic and the period is expressed by @xmath59 when @xmath44 is zero we use ( 9 ) instead of ( 8) to obtain a similar expression , a result which shows that the condition @xmath60 alone represents nothing special as one would believe in the aref classification ( for more details see the third part of this paper ) . to have a dimensionless result we can take as unit of time @xmath61 which is , as we shall see later , the period of the absolute motion when the vortices are in a configuration of relative equilibrium",
    "; therefore , in every domain of the multiply - connected @xmath0 plane , @xmath62 depends only on @xmath63 .",
    "then , using ( 8) or ( 9 ) , we conclude that , when the reduced motion is periodic , the modulus of @xmath66 has the period @xmath1 of the reduced motion . as to the arguments of these affixes ,",
    "after one period they have all been increased by the same value , modulo @xmath67 : @xmath68_{o}^{t}\\\\[14pt ] \\ds \\qquad\\;=\\oint \\frac{-k { \\rm re}\\{(\\zeta^{2}+d\\zeta)(\\bar{\\zeta}^{2}+d\\bar{\\zeta}-\\kappa_{2}\\kappa_{3})\\}}{2|\\zeta|^{2}(\\kappa_{1}|\\zeta|^{2}+\\kappa_{2}\\kappa_{3}k){\\rm im}(\\zeta^{2}+d\\zeta)}\\d|\\zeta|^{2}=\\delta\\varphi,\\\\[14pt ] \\ds \\delta\\varphi_{2}=\\delta\\varphi_{1}+\\left[\\arg\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{3}k-\\kappa_{1}\\zeta}{s\\zeta}\\right)\\right]_{o}^{t}=\\delta \\varphi\\ { \\rm modulo}\\ 2\\pi,\\\\[14pt ] \\ds \\delta\\varphi_{3}=\\delta\\varphi_{1}+\\left[\\arg\\left(\\frac{-\\kappa_{2}k-\\kappa_{1}\\zeta}{s\\zeta}\\right)\\right]_{o}^{t}=\\delta \\varphi\\ { \\rm modulo}\\ 2\\pi.\\\\ \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    for the motion it means that , after a time interval of @xmath1 , the shape and size of the triangle are again the same , i.e. the new positions are deduced from their initial values by a rotation of @xmath69 around the center of vorticity .",
    "depending on the domain of initial conditions , the number of turns around the barycentrum may vary from one vortex to another by an integer value . therefore , when @xmath39 is nonzero , the absolute motion of any vortex is the product of a uniform rotation about the barycentrum and of a periodic motion , the two periods being the same for the three vortices : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is periodic with period 1 . in other words , in uniformly rotating axes centered at the barycentrum ,",
    "the absolute motion is periodic .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the absolute trajectory of @xmath31 both in fixed axes and in rotating axes , for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( the @xmath0 orbit is the small curve surrounding @xmath74 in figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "some symmetries may exist in the absolute motion : for instance if the @xmath0 axis is an axis of symmetry of the @xmath0 orbit , then at intervals distant of @xmath2 the vortices are colinear ; if we choose for origin of time an instant of colinearity , the absolute trajectory of every vortex , when run between 0 and  @xmath1 , possesses an axis of symmetry ( see figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "-1let us now mention an important result concerning this dynamical system : since integral ( 14 ) is a continuous function of both the strengths @xmath80 and the initial conditions , the angle @xmath69 is generically incommensurable with @xmath67 , i.e. commensurability occurs only for a set of strengths and initial conditions of zero measure . we conclude that generically , due to the incommensurability of @xmath69 with @xmath67 , the trajectory of a given vortex completely fills an annulus centered at the barycentrum ( see landau and lifchitz figure  [ fig9 ] chap .",
    "iii ) .    in the case of a vortex plasma @xmath81 and",
    "when the barycentrum is at infinity @xmath82 , the variation of @xmath64 over one period does not depend on @xmath83 and is given by @xmath84_{o}^{t}=\\oint\\frac{(\\zeta^{2}+d\\zeta)(\\bar{\\zeta}^{2}+d\\bar{\\zeta}-\\kappa_{2}\\kappa_{3 } ) } { 2\\kappa_{1}|\\zeta|^{4}\\;{\\rm im}(\\zeta^{2}+d\\zeta)}\\d|\\zeta|^{2},\\ ] ] which evaluates to a real quantity .",
    "the rotation has become a uniform translation in the direction normal to the direction of the impulse .",
    "the common mean velocity of the vortices is @xmath85/t$ ] and , for instance in the case of an initial equilateral triangle where the absolute motion is a uniform translation , this velocity evaluates to @xmath86 .    let us conclude all that with a geometrical remark : the relations @xmath87 and @xmath88 show that the extrema of @xmath89 occur simultaneously with those of @xmath90 @xmath91 permutation of @xmath92 ) and that they are reached when the triangle is either flat or isosceles with @xmath4 as a summit .",
    "an important practical case is that of the invariance of a @xmath0 orbit under one of the six permutations of the three elements @xmath36 .",
    "for instance the permutation ( 132 ) acts by : @xmath93 , @xmath94 and is seen to leave the set of @xmath0 orbits invariant provided @xmath95 . since most of the vortices encountered in nature have equal , or opposite , strengths , we shall consider this particular case in some detail .",
    "-1let us therefore assume @xmath95 and consider a @xmath0 orbit having the origin as a center of symmetry ( e.g. the circle @xmath60 on the figure  [ fig3 ] assumed continuously deformed so as to admit the origin as a center of symmetry ; note that , on the same figure , the orbit surrounding @xmath96 has not the required property ) .",
    "having chosen such an initial condition @xmath97 , @xmath98 , during the evolution there will happen a time when @xmath0 evaluates to @xmath99 ; this time is necessarily equal to the half - period @xmath100 and , since the states ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) and @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) are identical from a point of view of initial conditions , we conclude to the identity of the motions for @xmath103 and for @xmath104 ; the triangle at @xmath105 is deduced from the triangle at @xmath97 by some fixed rotation around the barycentrum ( a change of size and a translation are excluded because of the invariants ) and of course by the exchange of 2 and 3 @xmath106 : @xmath107    by iterating , we see that @xmath108 is equal to @xmath69 modulo @xmath67",
    ". therefore the absolute motions of 2 and 3 are identical , up to a rotation in space and a translation in time .",
    "every absolute trajectory has two independent axes of symmetry and therefore , an infinity : they are defined by the barycentrum and the absolute positions of the vortex when the triangle is either isosceles or flat ( i.e. when @xmath0 crosses one of its two symmetry axes ) .",
    "if @xmath39 is zero , i.e. @xmath109 , the conclusions are similar , with a translation of @xmath110 instead of a rotation , @xmath111 being the translation after one period ; the initial conditions which have the required symmetry are defined by @xmath112 .",
    "let us now study the absolute motion of three identical vortices .",
    "the set of orbits is invariant under the six permutations , but a given orbit is only invariant under two or three of them .",
    "two regimes are found :    1 .",
    "@xmath113{2}<c$ ] .",
    "the shortest of the three mutual distances is always the same , say @xmath114 , the @xmath0 orbit is invariant by a permutation of 2 and 3 and the above conclusions apply .",
    "the three vortices are colinear at intervals of @xmath100 .",
    "choosing for @xmath97 a colinear configuration , the triangle is isosceles at @xmath115 , @xmath116 and the summit of the triangle is then always the same vortex @xmath31 .",

    "the @xmath0 orbit is invariant under any circular permutation and , using quite similar arguments , we deduce for instance @xmath106 : @xmath118 z_{3}(t)=z_{1}\\left(t-\\frac{t}{3}\\right)e^{i\\alpha},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath119 modulo @xmath67 .",
    "this time , the three motions are identical",
    ". the vortices are never colinear . choosing for @xmath97 an isosceles configuration",
    ", we see that the triangle regains the same shape at @xmath120 , successively with the summits @xmath92 ( or @xmath121 depending on the initial conditions ) , and a second isosceles shape at @xmath122 .        in two fundamental papers linking topology to mechanics , smale ( 1970 )",
    "explains how to split the study of any dynamical system into two simpler problems .",
    "he first defines the integral manifolds as the set of points in the phase space with given values of the invariants , or better as the quotient of that set by the symmetry group of the system .",
    "then the first problem is to find the topology of the integral manifolds of the phase space and more precisely to find the bifurcation set , i.e. the set of values of the invariants @xmath123 for which this topology , and therefore the nature of the motion , changes .",
    "the second problem , which has been solved above at least in the general case , is the study of the dynamical systems on the integral manifolds .",
    "since we do not want to insist on the mathematics , we shall only give the bifurcation set , i.e. , for every value of the strengths , we shall determine the values of @xmath15 and @xmath44 which cause a qualitative change in the absolute motion ; such a research will introduce separating lines in the strengths space",
    ".      due to the homogeneity of the equations of motion , the strengths space may be represented by its section by a plane @xmath39 @xmath124 constant and , in this plane , by a figure invariant under a rotation of @xmath125 around the point @xmath126 .",
    "its dimension is therefore 2 and we shall represent a point by its polar coordinates : @xmath127 @xmath128 describing any interval of amplitude @xmath129 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the strengths domains are defined in figure  [ fig1 ] . under the heading `` degeneracy '' are listed by interval of @xmath63 the number of different states , i.e. of @xmath0 orbits , having the same value of @xmath63 ; for instance , in the domain 11 , the limiting values of @xmath63 are @xmath130 ( at the points @xmath4 ) , 1 ( at the triangles ) , @xmath131 ( at the colinear relative equilibria ) , they define 6 intervals , hence a sequence of 6 degeneracy numbers ; when @xmath46 is zero , @xmath132 is used in place of @xmath63 for the classification .",
    "the column `` topology '' lists the sequence of the nature of the real remarkable @xmath0 points along the real axis : @xmath133 stands for a point @xmath4 ( we omit @xmath31 at infinity ) , @xmath134 for elliptic , hyperbolic , parabolic , @xmath135 for an @xmath133 coinciding with @xmath15 or @xmath14 and @xmath46 for the only higher - order point we found .",
    "the information on the nature of the triangles is contained in the column sign @xmath136 .",
    "all this is sufficient to draw every @xmath0 plane .    for given values of the strengths ,",
    "the space of invariants is a priori bidimensional , since the center of vorticity is not a relevant invariant except when @xmath39 is zero .",
    "let us compare this space to the space of initial conditions .",
    "as we have seen , an initial condition is an orbit in the @xmath0 plane , since two sets of absolute positions @xmath137 whose @xmath0 values belong to the same @xmath0 orbit evolve in the same absolute motion , up to a translation in time and a translation , rotation and scale change in space . on a given orbit",
    ", @xmath63 is constant , but , inversely , the equation @xmath138 represents a finite number ( between 0 and 4 , see table  [ tab1 ] ) of orbits . from this fact ,",
    "we draw two conclusions : first , the space of invariants @xmath123 is in fact of dimension one , two points being identified if they lead to the same value of @xmath139 ; second , an initial condition is characterized by , and therefore equivalent to , a value of the invariant @xmath63 plus an index of region in the @xmath0 plane ( or of sheet in the phase space ) .",
    "we can therefore identify the space of initial conditions to the product of the one - dimensional space of invariants by the finite set of the indices of region .",
    "accordingly , the most precise graphical representation will be the orbits of the @xmath0 plane , but we shall also use for simplicity a plane @xmath123 or an axis @xmath63 with some handwritten information on it to take into account the integer index .",
    "let us now proceed to the determination of the bifurcation set .",
    "we exclude the set of collisions , represented in the @xmath0 plane by three points of affixes @xmath55 , @xmath140 where @xmath63 evaluates to @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 or @xmath144 depending on the signs of @xmath145 and the strengths ; these limiting values of @xmath63 will therefore belong to the bifurcation set .",
    "the nature of the motion ( at least its topological nature since it is always generically biperiodic ) changes when there is a stationary point on the @xmath0 orbit ; such points , where the velocity of @xmath0 vanishes , are given by the solutions of the complex equation @xmath146 equivalent to @xmath147    these points are also the critical points of the function @xmath148 and they give all the relative equilibrium configurations of the three vortices , i.e. the states for which the system moves generally like a rigid body .",
    "the solutions of ( 17 ) are :    a.   one or three colinear configurations , defined by the real zeros of @xmath149 ( points @xmath150 of figures  [ fig2 ] to [ fig6 ] ) , b.   two equilateral triangles , defined by the zeros of @xmath151 , i.e. @xmath152 ( points @xmath96 and @xmath153 of figures  [ fig2 ] to [ fig6 ] ) ; these stationary triangles , already known to kelvin for identical vortices , therefore exist for vortices of any strengths . c.   when @xmath56 , the isolated zero @xmath154 of @xmath74 and every point of the circle @xmath155 on which lie the summits of the equilateral triangles and the two other real zeros of @xmath74 . on this circle",
    "@xmath44 is equal to zero .",
    "the corresponding absolute motions will be described later .",
    "it is interesting to remark that , except for some values of the strengths like for instance @xmath56 , the relative equilibria of the three vortex system are qualitatively the same than those of the three body problem of celestial mechanics , where there are two equilateral triangles and three colinear configurations ; in fact , a simple geometric reasoning shows the same qualitative composition of the set of relative equilibria for every planar three body motion ruled by a two body central interaction .",
    "the study of the stability of the relative equilibria is given in appendix  ii and only three different behaviours are found ( in celestial mechanics , only two cases arise : the three colinear configurations are always unstable , the two triangles are stable for @xmath156 , unstable otherwise ) , depending on the signs of two polynoms of the strengths of even degree :        the important role played by @xmath46 can easily be understood if we notice that the angular momentum of the system @xmath158 is precisely @xmath159 . like for the planar three body problem ( see smale  ii ) , we are going to see that its sign is a basic element of classification of the topology of the phase space and that very special behaviours of the motion occur when it vanishes .",
    "> from ( 7 ) we see that there is no other @xmath0 orbit where the nature of the motion changes . for given values of the strengths ,",
    "the bifurcation set is therefore the union , in the @xmath0 plane , of the three points @xmath55 , @xmath140 and the three or five orbits going through the stationary points ( see figures  [ fig2 ] to [ fig4 ] , where some other ordinary orbits have been added ) .",
    "note that the circle @xmath160 on which @xmath44 is zero does not belong to the bifurcation set , except when @xmath46 is zero as we shall see .",
    "however , when we represent the bifurcation set in the @xmath161 plane , the line @xmath60 seems to belong to it for it is for some values of the strengths the limiting curve @xmath162 associated with two vortices at the same location ; figure  [ fig10 ] shows the same bifurcation set as figure  [ fig3 ] , but represented in the plane @xmath161 .",
    "-1special behaviour for the motion will be obtained when two or more elements of the bifurcation set come into coincidence .",
    "this will give us separating lines in the strengths plane .",
    "the only conditions of coincidence between the solutions of ( 17 ) and the set ( d ) of collisions @xmath164 , @xmath165 are :      we must add to the above mentioned lines the three lines given by @xmath168 which are forbidden .",
    "@xmath169 is represented by three lines , @xmath56 by the circle @xmath170 and @xmath171 by a quartic of equation : @xmath172 the form of which reflects the ternary symmetry .",
    "the intersections of these lines define three distinct remarkable points that we shall study explicitly : @xmath173 & & \\hbox{point b : $ \\rho=3$},\\quad \\hbox{$\\ds 3\\theta=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ ( strengths $ -5,4,4$)},\\\\[4pt ] & & \\hbox{point c : $ \\rho=\\sqrt{5}$},\\quad \\hbox{$\\ds \\sin\\;3\\theta=\\frac{-11\\sqrt{5}}{25}$ ( strengths $ -2,\\sqrt{3},2$).}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      these lines define different domains in the strengths space , which has been represented on figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "when we stay in one of these domains , the topology of the bifurcation set does not change , and table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the results concerning the bifurcation set for all domains of the strengths space .",
    "the classification for the bifurcation set is mainly based on the signs of @xmath46 and @xmath174 , i.e. on the number and stability of the relative equilibria ; among the three quantities , i.e. arithmetic , geometric and harmonic means of the strengths , whose signs were proposed by aref as a basis for a classification , only the third one @xmath175 is relevant , although the factor @xmath176 prevents it from being invariant under a strengths reversal , an operation equivalent to a time reversal which must leave invariant any candidate to a classification ; moreover , for any @xmath24 , the formula @xmath177 , not @xmath178 , expresses the associated physical property of invariance of the energy under a change of length .    in the next part",
    ", we describe the behaviour of the three vortex system when it is nongeneric , i.e. when either the strengths are on the boundaries of the domains represented on figure  [ fig1 ] or when the initial conditions are those of a relative equilibrium",

    "@xmath180 it follows that the distance from each point to the barycentrum remains constant .",

    "these four points are the points of contact of the circle @xmath60 with the set of @xmath0 trajectories whose equation is now : @xmath195      let us assume @xmath0 on the circle @xmath60 .",
    "this circle is no longer a trajectory and the @xmath0 point stays at rest .",
    "the two conditions @xmath196 , @xmath197 express that both the energy and the inertia momentum relative to the barycentrum are invariant under a change of length , and therefore nothing prevents the vortices from going to infinity or to zero ; we see below that both cases are possible .",
    "the absolute motion is ruled by equation  ( 6 ) which implies that @xmath198 and @xmath199 are constant in time ( @xmath200 are polar coordinates of @xmath31 , @xmath40 is chosen zero ) .",
    "since the shape of the triangle is conserved , equation  ( 6 ) integrates as  in @xmath201 where the characteristic time @xmath202 and the initial angular velocity @xmath203 are defined  by @xmath204 -1@xmath203 never vanishes and has the sign of @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath205 vanishes and changes sign when @xmath0 is one of the four points already mentioned where the circle is tangent to the set of @xmath0 curves .",
    "we conclude that , for a @xmath0 point of the circle @xmath60 distinct of these four points , every vortex runs a logarithmic spiral whose pole is the barycentrum , the shape of the triangle remains constant and , depending on the sign of @xmath202 , the triangle either expands to infinity in an infinite time or collapses on the barycentrum in a finite time @xmath202 . at the time of this triple collision",
    "all the denominators of the equations of motion ( 1 ) simultaneously vanish like @xmath206 . after the collision ,",
    "the system is made of a single motionless vortex of strength @xmath39 located at what was the center of vorticity .",
    "when @xmath205 vanishes , the spiral motion degenerates into a uniform circular motion whose period @xmath207 can also be written as @xmath208 for the two aligned configurations and twice the same expression for the equilateral triangles .",
    "let us now examine the motion elsewhere in the @xmath0 plane @xmath209 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows that two generic situations exist depending on whether the @xmath0 orbit intersects or not the circle @xmath60 of singular points ; the limiting @xmath0 orbits , which belong to the bifurcation set , are @xmath210 ( tangent at @xmath211 ) and @xmath212 . for an energy @xmath15 outside the interval",

    "no motion exists which is asymptotic to the triple collision in a finite time : therefore the points of the half circonference ( from @xmath216 to @xmath96 and from @xmath217 to @xmath153 ) where such a collision exists are repulsive points , while the other half is made of attractive points .",
    "finally , the bifurcation set , which we have also represented in the @xmath161 plane on figure  [ fig11 ] , is the union of the following lines of the @xmath0 plane : the  set of collisions @xmath164 , @xmath218 ) , the circle @xmath60 ( not an orbit ) , the orbit going through @xmath219 , the orbit @xmath210 tangent to the circle at @xmath211 , the orbit @xmath212 tangent to the circle at @xmath217 and that portion of the orbit @xmath220 which is interior to the circle @xmath60 .",
    "two of the three colinear relative equilibria coincide except at the three points of retrogression @xmath221 of the quartic @xmath171 ( strengths @xmath222 ) where the three of them coincide and at the six points @xmath223 ( strengths @xmath224 ) where two of the strengths are opposite ( see next case ) .    for the absolute motion ,",
    "there is nothing qualitatively changed : in the vicinity of the double point @xmath225 , the orbits are equivalent to the cubics of equation @xmath226 and the period , which behaves like @xmath227 , diverges like @xmath228 ; the absolute motion is still biperiodic , although the triangle spends quite a long time in nearly aligned states . on the orbit",
    "@xmath229 passing through the unstable @xmath225 point , the absolute motion is asymptotic to the usual circular motion , the time law being different : @xmath230 , @xmath231 .",

    "the case @xmath234 will be described in next section .",
    "the point @xmath235 , which lies on the circle @xmath60 , is singular in the sense that for every @xmath63 value there exists a @xmath0 orbit passing through @xmath29 , which forbids a reduced periodic motion .",
    "therefore two generic situations exist , as shown on figure  [ fig6 ] : outside of the striped domain which contains @xmath60 , the absolute motion is biperiodic . inside this domain , for every @xmath63 value there is one and only one @xmath0 orbit and the @xmath0 point is attracted by @xmath29 in an infinite time : it tends to @xmath29 normally to the real axis following a law @xmath236    in the absolute space , the point @xmath237 stops and the two others go to infinity together with a motion asymptotic to a uniform translation in the direction normal to the line joining the final position of @xmath237 to the barycentrum , exactly as if they were alone and obeyed the motion of two vortices of opposite strengths : at the limit , the translation velocity is @xmath238 and the mutual distance is @xmath239 .",
    "this creation of a doublet can also be interpreted in terms of the elastic diffusion of the doublet by the third vortex : if we take for initial condition @xmath0 near to @xmath240 with @xmath241 positive , the vortices 1 and 2 are initially a doublet moving towards the third vortex ; then the three mutual distances become the same order of magnitude , i.e. there is interaction ; finally , the doublet emerges and goes to infinity away from the third vortex with unchanged mutual distance and velocity , but in a different direction .",
    "this is exactly a process of elastic diffusion .",

    "this set is simple enough to be represented without any ambiguity by a c axis with the number and type of solutions in each interval :          nothing special happens to the motion . at the triple point @xmath190 ,",
    "the vortex of strength @xmath275 is motionless as it coincides with the barycentrum , and the two other vortices , which are symmetric with regard to the barycentrum , obey the circular motion .",
    "the @xmath0 orbits around this stable point are equivalent to the quartics of equation @xmath276 and they correspond to ordinary motions ; however the period , which still behaves like @xmath277 , diverges as @xmath278 .            by using the two successive changes of variables @xmath284 and @xmath285 whose jacobians are respectively @xmath286 and",
    "@xmath287 we obtain @xmath288 and we still have to integrate over @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "since @xmath291 moves in time according to @xmath292 the integration is quite easy to perform and we finally get @xmath293 which shows that the density of states is the period of the reduced motion .",
    "this is a well known result of the theory of adiabatic invariants ( see e.g. landau and lifchitz ) , for energy and time are conjugate variables : when @xmath44 is constant and @xmath15 slowly varying , then the product @xmath294 is constant since the volume of the phase space if conserved .    to take into account the fact that the phase space is the union of disconnected parts",
    ", we must sum the above expression over the number ( between 0 and 4 , see table  [ tab1 ] ) of different domains associated to given values of @xmath15 and @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting volume @xmath295 obeys the scaling law : @xmath296      although it makes no sense to speak of thermodynamics about an integrable system , there may be some interest for the understanding of the behaviour of a large number of vortices to examine what the onsager s theory gives when formally applied to the three - vortex system .",
    "the main hypothesis made by onsager is that the total amount of volume @xmath299 available to the system is finite , an hypothesis equivalent to assume the system confined in a box since the phase space and the configuration space are the same . due to the scaling law for @xmath300 , the integral @xmath301 will be either finite and proportional to @xmath44 or infinite , depending on the strengths of the vortices .",
    "the first arising question is therefore : when @xmath44 is kept constant , is the integral @xmath302 finite or not , i.e. are all the singularities of @xmath1 integrable or not ?",
    "\\(b ) @xmath0 tends to an unstable @xmath308 value , whose @xmath63 value is @xmath309 .",

    "the unit of time we chose , i.e. @xmath316 , is a posteriori convenient for it is proportional to the volume .",
    "let us now examine the behaviour of the thermodynamical quantities , keeping in mind that any conclusion is meaningless for three vortices and can only be indicative for a larger system .",
    "for instance in the domain 0 ( i.e. @xmath317 ) , the function @xmath318 @xmath319 is of course increasing , but the integrand @xmath300 , which is zero at the edges @xmath320 , positive and integrable , has three infinite maxima at finite values of the energy ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "each of these maxima corresponds to an unstable relative equilibrium configuration or , in other words , to a point of the phase space which links two disconnected domains .",
    "this feature somehow complicates the correspondence between energy and temperature and there exists some numerical evidence ( lundgren and pointin , 1977 , and references herein ) of a possible lack of ergodicity which could come out of a multiple connexity of the phase space .",
    "another interesting observation is that , when the energy tends to @xmath143 , the `` temperature '' of the three vortex system tends to a constant , negative value ( fig .  [ fig7 ] ) , a fact already noticed for a large number of vortices by lundgren and pointin ( page  334 ) , c.e .",
    "seyler ( 1974 ) , edwards and taylor ( 1974 , page 262 ) .",
    "in addition to the fact of being an exactly soluble three body problem , the three vortex system is very interesting in connection with the theory of turbulence . unfortunately its number of degrees of freedom is too small to yield a chaotic behaviour ( the threshold for such a behaviour is 3 ) and this was confirmed by the results : nonperiodic behaviours are obtained only for very particular values of the parameters . a four vortex system ( see some preliminary results in conte , 1979 ) , with its 3 independent degrees of freedom and because we do not know about its integrability , is the really interesting dynamical system to study in order to have some hints about the integrability of the n vortex system .",
    "we want to thank y.  pomeau for many fruitful discussions which led to the discovery of the appropriate plane .",
    "we also greatly appreciated the formal reduce - like computer language amp ( drouffe , 1976 ) which helped us to establish the numerous necessary formulae .                                      for practical applications , it may be of interest to find which values of the @xmath6 s lead to integrable expressions for the period ( 12 ) .",
    "a first case is when two strengths are equal : @xmath95 ; then @xmath321 can be expressed only with @xmath322 , using ( 11 ) , and the period is a simple integral in the variable @xmath322 , which can be easily integrated numerically .",
    "another case is when , the strengths being rational , the algebraic curve ( 11 ) is of genus one or zero ( the genus of an algebraic curve of degree @xmath323 is equal to @xmath324 minus the number of double points ) .",
    "the only curve of genus zero is the circle @xmath60 but then the period is given by another non - integrable expression .",

    "there is some chance of finding curves of genus one .",
    "this belongs to the first but not to the second case ( degree 6 , genus 4 in general ) .",
