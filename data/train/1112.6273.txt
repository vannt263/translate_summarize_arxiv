    "a major issue in observational cosmology is to reconstruct the cosmic evolution of star formation and the detailed growth history of the present - day galaxies . even though it is not easy to reconstruct the whole path of the stellar mass for galaxies as a function of the present - day galaxy stellar mass @xmath7 and the cosmic time @xmath8 as @xmath9 , it is essential to obtain knowledge of their star formation rate ( sfr ) as a function @xmath10 .",
    "recent near - infrared ( nir ) observations suggest that most of the stellar mass is contained in massive galaxies , and that this situation had already become established at @xmath11 .",
    "this appears to have been followed by a rapid evolution of the stellar mass density between @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these recent studies imply that most of the massive galaxies must already have formed at @xmath13 , supporting the so - called _ downsizing _",
    "scenario @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "star formation shifts from higher to lower mass galaxies as a function of cosmic time @xmath8 , although the stellar mass in massive galaxies may not directly follow the growth history of their dark matter halos ( dmhs ) which build up hierarchically from less massive systems to more massive ones at a later time . however , several studies of massive galaxies at @xmath14 @xcite report the evolution from predominantly blue to red galaxies , suggesting that the number and stellar mass of galaxies in the red - sequence may continue to grow , even after @xmath15 @xcite , in agreement with the hierarchical merging scenario . recently , a mass - dependent quenching of star formation has been proposed to explain these rapid increase of the number density of the massive galaxies relative to lower - mass galaxies at @xmath16 ( peng et al . 2010 ; kajisawa 2011 ; brammer et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the evolutionary path of the @xmath9 up to the present mass @xmath7 can be also reconstructed from knowledge of the @xmath10 .",
    "recent studies have confirmed the features for rapid sfr evolution up to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , we have not found a general consensus concerning the stellar mass dependence for specific sfrs : @xmath18 ( the sfr per unit stellar mass ) .",
    "most studies based on uv derived sfr s have found evidence to support an anti - correlation with stellar mass , not only local galaxies , but also the distant universe , supporting the _ downsizing _ scenario .",
    "it is not easy , however , to accept that uv estimates are the only way to estimate the sfr that will capture all the emission originally from new born stars in a galaxy , which can be independently estimated from rest - frame luminosities in the uv , ir , submillimeter ( submm ) , and radio wavelength regions by introducing appropriate calibration factors .",
    "although the uv luminosity is used as a proxy of the sfr , its reliability often depends on the use of large , and rather uncertain corrections for dust extinction .",
    "most of the short wavelength photons from star - forming galaxies are reprocessed through absorption and scattering with dust in their star - forming regions , and then re - emitted in the ir - submm wavelength regions .",
    "thus , the mid / far - ir and their submillimeter emissions become an important tracer of the total star forming activity in high-@xmath19 galaxies .",
    "the total ir ( tir ) luminosity @xmath20 integrated across the long wavelength spectral region is a good proxy for the sfr , which is relatively independent of the dust obscuration @xcite .",
    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) up to @xmath16 , detected at the mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelength with the ir observing satellites as the iso @xcite , the akari @xcite , and the _ spitzer _ @xcite , have shown that the sfr rapidly increases with the redshift , as they contribute @xmath21 of the cosmic infrared luminosity density @xcite . the mir emission from lirgs",
    "/ ulirgs is evidence of dusty starburst or agn surrounded by a dusty torus .",
    "recently , the lirgs / ulirgs are expected to suppress star formation at @xmath16 with feedback activity from starbursts or agns .",
    "understanding of the lirgs / ulirgs at @xmath16 can be a key to solve the cosmic history of star formation and agn activities .",
    "the sfr for galaxies detected with the _ spitzer _ is frequently estimated with the tir luminosity estimated from the 24 @xmath1 m flux @xcite , which is nearly proportional to their stellar mass up to @xmath17 .",
    "these recent results with the _ spitzer _ are also basically consistent with recent results from stacking analysis for their radio emissions @xcite as another sfr estimation immune to dust extinctions .",
    "these two radio stacking analyses , however , show a discrepancy in their details as @xcite report ssfr with a negative correlation to stellar mass while @xcite report ssfr with stellar mass independence .",
    "thus , there may be various unknown factors in the sfr estimations .",
    "the tir luminosity @xmath20 of lirgs / ulirgs is generally derived from the fitting of the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with synthetic templates . in the sed",
    "fitting , we could sometimes use only a few bands in the ir wavelength without longer @xmath22 m wavelengths , which may cause large uncertainties in the @xmath20 estimation .",
    "obscured agns are another notable problem in the @xmath20 estimation .",
    "it means that a sample selection without significant agn contamination is also important to obtain an accurate @xmath23 .",
    "thus , systematically designed surveys are required to construct samples for distant star - forming galaxies .",
    "optical surveys have been successful in selecting numerous lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) as star forming galaxies beyond @xmath24 and even up to z @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "they may , however , fail to detect substantial numbers of massive galaxies at @xmath26 , in which the lyman break photometric technique does not work well with ground - based telescopes because of telluric absorption .",
    "furthermore , even if galaxies are undergoing intensive star formation , the internal dust extinction of their uv radiation may reduce the prominence of their lyman break features , to appear as lirgs / ulirgs in the local universe .",
    "however , alternative photometric techniques can be used to select massive high-@xmath19 galaxies through their balmer/4000    break or the 1.6 @xmath1 m bump features in their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , as evidence of the presence of an evolved stellar population .",
    "we will designate the former and the latter as balmer break galaxies ( bbgs ) and as ir bump galaxies ( irbgs ) , respectively .",
    "it is known that both star - forming and passive bbgs in the redshift desert around @xmath27 can be selected with a simple and sophisticated two - color selection based on @xmath28 , and @xmath29 band photometry @xcite .",
    "this three filter optical - nir technique was designed to detect the balmer/4000    break , nearly free from the dust extinction which caused some difficulties for previous ` red color ' techniques relying on a color diagnostic of @xmath30 , corresponding to @xmath31 @xcite or for @xmath32 corresponding to @xmath33 @xcite . with the near - ir ( nir ) observations from the _ spitzer _ and from the akari , it has become possible to select irbgs at @xmath34 with nir colors at @xmath35 @xmath1 m of the 1.6 @xmath1 m bump @xcite .",
    "these optical - nir observations , detecting the balmer/4000    break and the 1.6 @xmath1 m bump , have been also useful to trace how stellar mass is correlated with the absolute nir luminosity .",
    "although optical - nir multi - band photometry has the potential to select a sample for star - forming massive galaxies , it may not be completely free from the agn contamination .",
    "mir multi - band photometry tracing pah emissions at 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.3 @xmath1 m and silicate ( si ) absorption at 10  @xmath1 m ( rest - frame ) from dusty star - forming regions , can be used to discriminate between the star - forming activity in lirgs / ulirgs and that of agn dominated galaxies .",
    "thus , systematic multi - wavelength observations that include observations at @xmath36 m are important for studies the star - forming activity of massive high-@xmath19 galaxies , and in looking back at the evolution of their sfrs .",
    "in order to connect the history of stellar mass growth in massive galaxies traced in optical - nir wavelength with ground based telescopes and that of star formation traced in mir wavelength observed outside of the atmosphere , we undertook multi - wavelength surveys of deep and wide areas with @xmath37 and @xmath38 deg@xmath39 , respectively , in a field close to the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) , which were extensively observed at the ir wavelength with the first japanese infrared astronomical satellite akari .",
    "in this paper , we attempt to reconstruct the cosmic history of dusty massive galaxies up to @xmath17 , selected estimated from optical - ir images in the nep survey field .",

    "if ebos are type 1 agns , this trend is reasonable since sed models of the agns were not included in sed fittings for the photometric redshift estimations .",
    "the akari mir colors can alternatively extract candidates associated with dusty agn activities , in which we spectroscopically observed 14 agn - mbn3rs and 2 s / a - mbn3rs ( see the details about them in subsection  [ subsec : mir_sed_sb_agn ] ) .",

    "this supports not only the above expectations that agns are harbored in the ebos and the agn - mbn3rs but also a picture of a dusty torus surrounding agn which can explain the variation of their seds as frequently proposed in the agn unified theory .",
    "we also checked the redshift discrepancy @xmath144 in various populations subclassified not only with the spectroscopy , but also with nir and mir photometry as n3rs and mbn3rs , which are summarized in appendix  [ app_sec : photz_var ] . even though most of the spectroscopic samples are mainly selected from dusty populations with heavy extinction as mbn3rs detected in the akari mir photometry , their median accuracies of @xmath140 are less than 0.05 for any subclassified populations of n3rs and mbn3rs except agn - mbn3rs .",

    "the cmd fundamentally is almost the same as the color - mass diagram , which is a powerful tool for studying galaxy evolution since it shows the bimodal galaxy distribution as early types concentrate on a tight red sequence while late types distribute in a blue dispersed cloud .",

    "these particular color criteria also allow efficient selections of the bbgs not only for @xmath196 , but also @xmath194 and @xmath195 .    in order to study the validity and physical meaning of the two - color criteria that are generalized from the phenomenologically established @xmath72 technique of @xcite , we used the bc03 models to reproduce the blue @xmath197 and red colors @xmath198 of model galaxies , which are described and shown in figures  [ fig : urjmodel ] and [ fig : uvimodel ] in appendix  [ app_subsec : track_bbg ] .",

    "the colors of normal galaxies , obtained from the cww sed templates , fall outside the color area of the bbgs in the redshift ranges for each of the bbg selections .",

    "the stellar mass @xmath41 is estimated in a standard way with the optical - nir sed fitting for all the @xmath45-detected galaxies and an alternative way from the akari / nir photometry for the irbgs as a subclass in the @xmath45-detected galaxies .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath246 band wavelength corresponds to the rest - frame 1.6-@xmath1 m ir bump where the emission is dominated by the stellar components in galaxies .",
    "it means that the absolute magnitude in rest - frame @xmath246-band @xmath338 represents the underlying stellar mass content @xmath41 .",

    "first , the @xmath85 , and @xmath86 photometry can directly detect the 1.6-@xmath1 m bump from the akari / irc detected irbgs even at @xmath95 . using the interpolation scheme with equation  ( [ eq : mag_intr ] ) for the @xmath85 , and @xmath86 photometry with @xmath344 m and @xmath157",
    ", we can estimate the absolute magnitude @xmath345 corresponding to the rest - frame @xmath246-band directly from the @xmath346 magnitudes of the akari / irc detected irbgs .",
    "second , the model fitting of @xcite , with the whole ground - based @xmath125@xmath126@xmath127 sed , derives the absolute magnitude @xmath124 with our small modified version of the _ hyperz _ as instantaneously deriving the photometric redshift @xmath40 in subsection  [ subsec : photz ] .",
    "it can apply for all the @xmath45-detected galaxies .",
    "thus , the derived @xmath347 from the optical - nir sed fitting with the ground - based photometric data is an alternative to determine the stellar mass @xmath348 .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath347 from the optical - nir sed fitting is well correlated with that @xmath345 from the @xmath349 , and @xmath86 photometry as shown in figure  [ fig : n234_rest_h ] .",
    "note this rest - frame @xmath345 from the akari / nir data can be approximately independent to the @xmath347 from the ground - based optical / nir data , except for the photometric redshift @xmath40 derived from the optical dataset .",
    "figure  [ fig : n234_rest_h ] presents not only the consistency between the ground - based nir and the akari / nir observations , but also accuracy for the photometric redshift from the sed fitting only with the ground - based data .    weak age dependence between @xmath41 and @xmath350 can be seen in figure  [ fig : habs_smass_irbg ] , in which the deep dark and faint symbols represent old and young populations in the red sequence and blue cloud ) , respectively , in the @xmath351 as discussed in subsection  [ subsec : smass_uvcol ] .    even though the relation between an absolute magnitude @xmath318 in a band and the stellar mass @xmath348 depends on the initial mass function ( imf ) and the star formation histories , they can be approximately described as @xmath352 where @xmath353 is the rest - frame absolute magnitude corresponding to the stellar mass of @xmath354m@xmath250 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : habs_smass_irbg ] , for the @xmath338 in the @xmath246 band , we can take @xmath355 .",
    "even though we mainly used the stellar mass @xmath41 derived directly from the optical - nir sed fittings in the following , the conversion from @xmath338 to @xmath41 is useful as a quick estimation of stellar mass @xmath41 .",
    "we also checked the relation between absolute rest - frame @xmath67-band magnitude @xmath155 and stellar mass @xmath41 ( @xmath155-@xmath41 diagram ) derived from the optical - nir sed fitting as shown in figure  [ fig : mv_smass_bbg_irbg_mbn3r ] .",
    "the ebos and the bl agns appear in the right region in the @xmath155-@xmath41 diagram , where normal star forming galaxies can appear only at the early phase @xmath263 gyr . their results in @xmath155-@xmath41 is consistent with their one on the cmd in subsection  [ subsec : mv_uvcol ] as the ebos are candidates of agns ( see also appendix  [ app_sec : model ] ) . after excluding these ebos",
    ", we obtained a relation between @xmath155 and @xmath41 , approximated as equation  ( [ eq : mag_smass ] ) with taking @xmath356 , as shown in figure  [ fig : mv_smass_bbg_irbg_mbn3r ] .",

    "<S> we have studied the star - formation and agn activity of massive galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 , which are detected in a deep survey field using the akari infrared ( ir ) astronomical satellite and _ subaru _ telescope toward the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) . </S>",
    "<S> the akari / irc mid - infrared ( mir ) multiband photometry is used to trace their star - forming activities with the polycyclic - aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emissions , which is also used to distinguish star - forming populations from agn dominated ones and to estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) derived from their total emitting ir ( tir ) luminosities . in combination with analyses of their stellar components , we have studied the mir sed features of star - forming and agn - harboring galaxies , which we summarize below : 1 ) the rest - frame 7.7-@xmath1 m and 5-@xmath1 m luminosities are good tracers of star - forming and agn activities from their pah and dusty tori emissions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) for dusty star - forming galaxies without agn , their sfr shows a correlation that is nearly proportional to their stellar mass and their specific sfr ( ssfr ) per unit stellar mass increases with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> extinctions estimated from their tir luminosities are larger than those from their optical sed fittings , which may be caused by geometric variations of dust in them . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) even for dusty star - forming galaxies with agn , sfrs can be derived from their tir luminosities with subtraction of the obscured agn contribution , which indicates that their sfrs were possibly quenched around @xmath2 compared with those without agn . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) the agn activity from their rest - frame 5-@xmath1 m luminosity suggests that their super massive black holes ( smbh ) could already have grown to @xmath3 in most massive galaxies with @xmath4 at @xmath5 , and the mass relation between smbhs and their host galaxies has already become established by @xmath6 . </S>"
