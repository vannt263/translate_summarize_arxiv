    "the @xmath0 is still a mysterious particle due to its small mass .",
    "it is the lightest negative - parity baryon although it contains a strange valence quark .",
    "the conventional quark model , in which the @xmath0 is assigned as the flavor - singlet state in the 70 dimensional representation under the spin - flavor su(6 ) symmetry , can not explain this small mass .",
    "since the mass is just below the @xmath1 threshold , there is another interpretation based on a five - quark picture , a @xmath1 bound state or a @xmath2 resonance .",
    "it is likely that the actual @xmath0 will be a mixed state of these two pictures .",
    "however , knowing which picture is the dominant contribution is quite important for hyper - nuclear physics and astro - nuclear physics , because the proton in the @xmath3 bound state suffers from the pauli blocking effect in nuclear matter .",
    "it may influence on the existence of the kaonic nuclei and kaon condensation in neutron stars .",
    "quenched lattice qcd is a useful tool to distinguish between the three- and the five - quark pictures of the @xmath0 , because it is more valence - like than dynamical qcd due to the absence of sea quarks .",
    "recently we have calculated the @xmath0 and other low - lying negative - parity baryon spectra in anisotropic quenched lattice qcd @xcite . in this",
    "talk we mainly report our results and comment on other recent two lattice studies on the @xmath0 spectrum @xcite .",
    "we employ the standard wilson gauge action and the @xmath4 improved wilson quark action with tadpole improvement .",
    "we adopt the anisotropic lattice since fine resolution in the temporal direction makes us easy to follow the change of heavy - baryon correlations and to determine the fitting ranges for their masses .",
    "we take the renormalized anisotropy as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the spatial and temporal lattice spacings , respectively .",
    "the simulation is carried out on the three lattices where parameters are well tuned and errors are rather well evaluated @xcite .",
    "the sizes of the lattices are @xmath8 i.e. , @xmath9gev ) , @xmath10 i.e. , @xmath11gev ) , and @xmath12 i.e. ,",
    "@xmath13gev ) .",
    "the scale @xmath14 is determined from the @xmath15 meson mass .",
    "determination of the other parameters is described in ref.@xcite .    as for the quark mass ,",
    "we adopt four different values which roughly cover around strange quark mass and correspond to the pion mass being about @xmath16gev .",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ res ] ) .",
    "we use the standard baryon operators which survive in the nonrelativistic limit : the @xmath17 form for the octet and the @xmath18 form for the decuplet . here",
    "@xmath19 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "for the @xmath0 we use the flavor - singlet operator following the assignment of the quark model , @xmath20 where we have omitted the color indices for simplicity .",
    "both the positive- and negative - parity baryon spectra can be obtained from these operators using the parity projection , because they couple to both the parity states . in the source operator ,",
    "each quark is spatially smeared with the gaussian function with the width @xmath21 fm for better overlap with the low - lying states .",
    "the numerical results and the fit results of the baryon spectrum for the finest @xmath22gev ) lattice are shown in fig.[res ] .",
    "the results from the other lattices are similar @xcite .",
    "the physical @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 quark masses are determined with the @xmath26 and @xmath27 meson masses . for each baryon , two of quark masses are taken to be the same value , @xmath28 , and the other quark mass @xmath29 is taken to be an independent value .",
    "the baryon masses are then expressed by the function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but the numerical results seem to be well described with the linear form , @xmath30 .",
    "therefore we fit the baryon spectrum to the linear form in the sum of corresponding pseudoscalar meson mass squared , @xmath31 with @xmath32 for baryons , as shown in fig .",
    "[ res ] .    we have also calculated the vector meson spectrum with the same way mentioned above and have used the same fitting method .",
    "our results for the vector meson and the positive - parity baryons are consistent with those obtained in ref .",
    "from fig.[res ] , the chiral extrapolated results of the negative - parity baryon spectrum are heavier than those of the corresponding positive - parity sectors for octet and decuplet , as expected .",
    "the flavor - singlet negative - parity baryon is , however , lighter than the positive - parity one .",
    "this is consistent with the conventional quark model , in which the flavor - singlet positive - parity baryon is assigned as a state with the principal quantum number @xmath33 , while the negative - parity sector has @xmath34 .",
    "various baryon masses at the @xmath35 lattice together with the experimental values are shown in fig.[comp ] .",
    "as for the negative - parity baryons , most of the lattice results comparatively well reproduce the experiment .",
    "the flavor - singlet baryon is , however , exceptional : its calculated mass of about 1.7gev is much heavier than the @xmath0 with a difference of more than 300 mev .",
    "the difference between them is actually the largest in all the hadrons in consideration .",
    "we also note that the flavor - singlet baryon has one strange valence quark and therefore the systematic error from the chiral extrapolation should be less than that of the nucleon and the delta .",
    "even if one takes the systematic error coming from the quenching effect of 10% level into account , this discrepancy of more than 300 mev can not be accepted .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider the flavor - singlet baryon is physically different from the @xmath0 .",
    "the flavor - octet negative - parity @xmath36 baryon mass is almost the same as the flavor - singlet one and thus it also is not likely to be a candidate of the @xmath0 .",
    "we turn to other two lattice studies on the @xmath0 .",
    "investigated excited state baryons using an improved quenched wilson gauge and an improved wilson quark actions @xcite .",
    "they computed an operator composed of the terms common to the flavor - octet @xmath36 operator and the flavor - singlet operator , i.e. , @xmath37 to study the @xmath0 .",
    "this allows for mixing between octet and singlet states by the favor su(3 ) symmetry breaking due to the strange quark mass .",
    "although they did not take the chiral extrapolation of the results , the result for the common operator is still much heavier than the @xmath0 , about 1.8gev , if one assumes the simple linear form for the chiral extrapolation .",
    "therefore , as their conclusion , the @xmath0 does not couple strongly to the operator ( [ common ] ) and further investigations such as with lighter quark masses or dynamical quarks are needed .",
    "lee _ et al .",
    "_ studied excited state baryons using the overlap fermions @xcite .",
    "they did not employ any special operators for the @xmath0 but the usual flavor - octet operators to compare with experiment .",
    "the overlap fermion is able to access light quark masses than ever because of the good chiral property .",
    "in fact they took very light quark masses for which the lightest pion mass becomes about 0.18gev .",
    "the quark mass dependence of the baryons is apparently different from the other two studies : non - linear forms of the chiral extrapolation are clearly seen in the light quark mass region @xmath38 ) .",
    "the flavor - octet negative - parity spectrum rapidly decreases leading to about 0.14gev as the quark mass decreases .",
    "( our result @xcite and the result of ref.@xcite do not show such behavior , because their pion masses are about 0.6gev at most . )",
    "such a light quark mass region can , however , suffer from large systematic uncertainties even in the chiral sophisticated fermions .",
    "in particular some ghost effects coming from unitarity violation of the quenched approximation may be significant in this region .",
    "also a rather coarse lattice ( @xmath39 ) which they used would give hadron spectrum an additional uncertainty . hence further systematic error analyses are needed also in this case .",
    "we have focused on the @xmath0 spectrum in quenched lattice qcd . in our calculation with the anisotropic lattice , the flavor - singlet baryon mass measured with the three - quark operator is found to be about 1.7gev , which is much heavier than the @xmath0 . in ref.@xcite , an operator with terms common to the flavor - octet @xmath36 and the flavor - singlet states has been used to describe the @xmath0 , and the result seems to be very heavy after the naive chiral extrapolation .",
    "both the results present the difficulty in identifying the @xmath0 as the flavor - singlet three - quark baryon , which seems to indicate that the @xmath0 is dominated by an exotic state such as a @xmath1 molecule - like state .    on the other hand , it is reported in ref.@xcite that the linear chiral extrapolation of the excited baryon spectrum fails in the very light quark mass region using overlap fermions .",
    "their results are closer to experiment than the others , while further systematic error analyses coming from the quenching effects are needed in that light quark region .",
    "thus for more definite understanding of the @xmath0 on the lattice , it is desired to carry out more extensive work such as a simulation with dynamical quarks or pentaquark states like the @xmath1 state .",
