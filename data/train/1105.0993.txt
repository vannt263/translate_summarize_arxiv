    "<S> the absence of compelling theoretical model requires the parameterizing the dark energy to probe its properties . </S>",
    "<S> the parametrization of the equation of state of the dark energy is a common method . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the theoretical optimization of the parametrization based on the fisher information matrix . as a suitable parametrization </S>",
    "<S> , it should be stable at high redshift and should produce the determinant of the fisher matrix as large as possible . for the illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we propose one parametrization which can satisfy both criteria . by using the proper parametrization , we can improve the constraints on the dark energy even for the same data . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the weakness of the so - called principal component analysis method .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider strategies for the most accurate determination of the dark energy ( de ) parameters using cosmological observables . due to the absence of compelling theoretical model , the parameterizing the de by its equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is commonly used in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it is usually considered what is the optimal redshift distribution to best constrain those parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we contemplate the theoretical optimization by using the fisher information matrix and compare the different parametrization of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> if one has a dataset of observable @xmath2 with redshifts @xmath3 , @xmath4 , one may compute the least squares estimates of the cosmological parameters by minimizing ^2_o = _ i^n , [ chi2 ] where @xmath2 is the measured quantity , @xmath5 is the expected value of the observable for the redshift @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the set of cosmological parameters to estimate , and @xmath8 is the error on the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> then , the fisher information matrix is defined to be f_lm = _ p_l^ , p_m^ , [ fisher ] where @xmath9 are the parameter estimates ( _ i.e. _ where @xmath10 becomes minimum ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the likelihood function is approximately gaussian near the maximum likelihood ( ml ) point , the covariance matrix for a maximum likelihood estimator is given by ( c^-1 ) _ lm = |_p_l^ , p_m^ . </S>",
    "<S> [ invc ] the fisher information matrix is simply the expectation value of the inverse of the covariance matrix at the ml point . from now on , </S>",
    "<S> we will omit the square bracket and the evaluating parameter estimates in the fisher matrix for the convenience .    the iso-@xmath11 contour in the parameter space is approximated by the quadratic equation ( ) ^t f = _ o^2 , [ deltachi2 ] where @xmath12 is the deviation of the parameters from the fiducial value and @xmath13 is the fisher matrix given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fisher ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the most accurate determination of @xmath14 cosmological parameters is described by a minimal volume of the n - dimensional ellipsoid . </S>",
    "<S> the volume of the ellipsoid is given by v . </S>",
    "<S> [ v ] thus , the determination of @xmath13 should be maximum to minimize the volume of the uncertainty ellipsoid .    by using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chi2 ] ) and ( [ fisher ] ) , we obtain f_lm & = & - _ i=1^n + _ i=1^n + & & _ i=1^n _ lm , [ fisher2 ] where we use @xmath15 and define the approximate fisher matrix @xmath16 including only the second term in the original @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we can use this approximation because @xmath18 becomes minimum at ml point @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> |_p_l^ = - _ </S>",
    "<S> i=1^n |_p_l^ = 0 . </S>",
    "<S> [ chi2dp ] eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chi2dp ] ) can be interpreted as the summation of @xmath20 weighted by @xmath21 is zero . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the data converges to the fiducial values , the weighted summation of the variation of @xmath20 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 ) should be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the first term of the right hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fisher2 ] ) is much smaller than the second one . </S>",
    "<S> we will explicitly show this later in table . </S>",
    "<S> [ table2 ] by using @xmath23 data .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , @xmath7 includes the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath24 , the present value of the matter energy density contrast @xmath25 , the present value of the de density contrast @xmath26 and the parameters of the eos of de @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the flat universe and @xmath26 is determined as @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> now , we assume that the nuisance parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are exactly known and only consider the estimation of the parameters of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fisher2 ] ) can be further specified depending on the observables . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider when @xmath29 is a direct variable of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 corresponds to this case . </S>",
    "<S> then , the approximate fisher matrix becomes _ lm & = & _ i=1^n ( 3 ) ^2 ( _ 0^z_i d ( 1+x ) ) ( _ 0^z_i d ( 1+x ) ) [ fisher2wh ] + & & _ </S>",
    "<S> i=1^n g_i^2 ( _ 0^z_i d ( 1+x ) ) ( _ 0^z_i d ( 1+x ) ) , where we use @xmath30 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> second , if @xmath29 is included in @xmath31 as an integrand like in @xmath32 , then @xmath28 is given by _ </S>",
    "<S> lm & = & _ i=1^n ( _ 0^z_i dx ) ( _ 0^z_i dx ) . [ fisher2wdl ] in general , we can express the approximate fisher matrix as _ lm & = & _ i=1^n _ l=1^n _ m=1^n g_i^2 w_l(z_i ) w_m(z_i ) , + g_i & = & \\ {    ll & + &    . </S>",
    "<S> [ fisher3 ] + w_l(z_i ) & = & \\ {    ll _ </S>",
    "<S> 0^z_i d ( 1+x ) & + _ 0^z_i dx & .    . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the determinant of the approximate fisher matrix is given by ( ) = _ a , b , c , = 1^n _ abc ( _ i=1^n g_i^2 ) ^n w_1w_a w_2w_b w_3w_c , [ detf ] where @xmath33 , analogous to the levi - civita symbol , is @xmath34 for even commutations @xmath35 and @xmath36 for odd commutations , and zero if any index is repeated .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the models with two parameters @xmath37 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath38 is given by ( ) & = & |    cc g_i^2 ( w_a(z_i ) ) ^2 & g_i^2 ( w_a(z_i ) ) ( w_b(z_i ) ) + g_i^2 ( w_b(z_i ) ) ( w_a(z_i ) ) & g_i^2 ( w_b(z_i ) ) ^2     & = & _ i=1^n-1 </S>",
    "<S> _ j = i+1^n g_i^2 g_j^2 ( _ ij w_a(z_i ) w_b(z_j ) ) ^2 . [ detfw2 ] if we choose the observable as @xmath23 , then @xmath38 becomes ( ) _ h & & _ i=1^n-1 _ j = i+1^n g_i^2 g_j^2 ( _ 0^z_j f(x ) d - _ 0^z_i f(x ) d ) ^2 + & = & _ i=1^n-1 _ j = i+1^n g_i^2 g_j^2 \\ {    ll ( z_j - z_i ) ^2 & + ( ) ^2 & + ( - ) ^2 &    . </S>",
    "<S> . [ detfh ] we use the @xmath23 data obtained from the passively evolving galaxies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in the table [ table1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> .h(z ) from passively evolving galaxies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can extend the previous consideration to models with @xmath14 parameters and @xmath39 datapoint . </S>",
    "<S> then , the determinant of the approximate fisher matrix is obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ detf ] ) ( ) = _ i=1^n - n+1 _ j = i+1^n - n+2 _ l = n^n g_i^2 g_j^2 g_l^2 ( _ ij l w_a(z_i ) w_b(z_j ) w_n(z_l ) ) ^2 . </S>",
    "<S> [ detfn ] thus , the determinant of the @xmath28 is composed of @xmath40 number of components with @xmath41 where the binomial coefficient is given by @xmath42 . each component has the @xmath43 number of permutations . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider the observable @xmath23 , then the number of components inside the bracket of pca method is smaller than @xmath43 depending on the location of the principal components and the redshift distribution of the data . </S>",
    "<S> it is due to the fact that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is zero if data point is out of the corresponding principal component bin . </S>",
    "<S> thus , pca method gives less constraints to estimates than other parametrization for the same number of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find two important features from this . </S>",
    "<S> first , pca method has the weaker constraints than other methods because it produces smaller @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> second , @xmath38 is sensitive to both the location of the pca components and the data distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is partly agree to the argument in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we show the importance of parametrization to have the better constrain on the dark energy . even for the same data </S>",
    "<S> , we can improve the constraints of the dark energy if we find the proper parametrization of it . </S>",
    "<S> one can speculate the better parametrization based on this approach . </S>",
    "<S> even though pca is one of the most model independent parametrization , it suffer from the weaker constrain power than other methods . </S>"
