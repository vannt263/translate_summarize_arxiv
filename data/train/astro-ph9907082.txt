    "( 1999 ) have confirmed its low metallicity with an oxygen abundance of only @xmath4 1/50 the solar value .",
    "zwicky ( 1966 ) described i zw 18 as a double system of compact galaxies , which are in fact two bright knots of star formation with an angular separation of 58 .",
    "these two star - forming regions are referred to as the brighter northwest ( nw ) and fainter southeast ( se ) components ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and form what we will refer to as the main body .",
    "later studies by davidson , kinman & friedman ( 1989 ) and dufour & hester ( 1990 ) have revealed a more complex optical morphology . the most prominent diffuse feature , hereafter component c ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) , is a blue irregular star - forming region @xmath4 22  northwest of the nw component .",
    "dufour , esteban & castaeda ( 1996a ) , van zee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and izotov & thuan ( 1998 ) have shown the c component to have a systemic radial velocity equal to that of the ionized gas in the nw and se components , thus establishing its physical association to i  zw  18 .",
    "furthermore , van zee et al . (",
    "1998 ) have shown that this component is embedded in a common h i envelope with the main body .",
    "searle & sargent ( 1972 ) and hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) have suggested that i  zw  18 may be a young galaxy , recently undergoing its first burst of star formation .",
    "the latter authors concluded from hst images that the colours of the diffuse unresolved component surrounding the se and nw regions are consistent with a population of b and early a stars , i.e. with no evidence for older stars .",
    "ongoing star formation in the main body of i  zw  18 is implied by the discovery of a population of wolf - rayet stars in the nw component ( izotov et al .",
    "1997a ; legrand et al . 1997",
    "; de mello et al . 1998 ) .",
    "flux - calibrated optical spectra of the c component ( izotov & thuan 1998 ; van zee et al .",
    "1998 ) reveal a blue continuum with weak balmer absorption features and faint h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 in emission .",
    "such spectral features imply that the 2  region is ionized by a population of early b stars and suggest that the c component is older than the main body of i  zw  18 .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1998 ) have suggested an age sequence from the c component ( @xmath4 200 myr ) to the se region ( @xmath4 5 myr ) of active star formation .",
    "dufour et al . ( 1996b ) have discussed new hst imagery of i  zw  18 , including the c component , which is resolved into stars . based on the analyses of colour - magnitude diagrams",
    ", they concluded that star formation in the main body began at least 30  50 myr ago and is maintained to the present , as is apparent in the se component .",
    "martin ( 1996 ) and dufour et al .",
    "( 1996b ) have discussed the properties of expanding superbubbles of ionized gas driven by supernova explosions and have inferred dynamical ages of respectively 15  27 myr and 13  15 myr . as for the age of the c component , dufour et al .",
    "( 1996b ) found in a @xmath7 vs. @xmath1 colour - magnitude analysis a well defined upper stellar main sequence indicating an age of the blue stars of @xmath4 40 myr .",
    "however , numerous faint red stars were also present in the colour - magnitude diagram implying an age of 100  300 myr .",
    "dufour et al . ( 1996b ) therefore concluded that the c component consists of an older stellar population with an age of several hundred myr , but which has experienced recently a modest starburst in its southeastern half as evidenced by the presence of blue stars and h@xmath5 emission .",
    "recently , aloisi , tosi & greggio ( 1999 ) have discussed the star formation history in i zw 18 using the same hst wfpc2 archival data ( i.e. those by hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) and dufour et al .",
    "( 1996b ) ) .",
    "they compared observed colour - magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions with synthetic ones and concluded that there were two episodes of star formation in the main body , a first episode occuring over the last 0.5  1 gyr , an age more than 10 times larger than that derived by dufour et al .",
    "( 1996b ) , and a second episode with more intense activity taking place between 15 and 20 myr ago .",
    "no star formation has occurred within the last 15 myr . for the c component ,",
    "aloisi et al . ( 1999 ) estimated an age not exceeding 0.2 gyr .",
    "garnett et al . (",
    "1997 ) have presented measurements of the gas - phase c / o abundance ratio in both nw and se components , based on ultraviolet spectroscopy with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) onboard hst .",
    "they determined values of log c / o = 0.63 @xmath8 0.10 for the nw component and log c / o = 0.56 @xmath8 0.09 for the se component .",
    "these ratios , being significantly higher than in other metal - poor irregular galaxies , apparently require that carbon in i  zw  18 has been enriched by an older generation of stars .",
    "garnett et al . ( 1997 ) concluded that i  zw  18 must have undergone an episode of star formation several hundred million years ago .",
    "using the same hst ultraviolet spectra , izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) have rederived the c / o abundance ratio in both nw and se components of i  zw  18 .",
    "they obtained lower values of log c / o equal to 0.77 @xmath8 0.10 for the nw component and 0.74 @xmath8 0.09 for the se component . with these lower c / o ratios , i",
    "zw  18 does not stand apart anymore from other low - metallicity bcds .",
    "furthermore , the c / o ratios are in excellent agreement with those predicted by massive star nucleosynthesis theory . therefore",
    ", no preceding low - mass carbon - producing stellar population needs to be invoked , thus , supporting the original idea that i  zw  18 is a young galaxy undergoing its first episode of star formation ( searle & sargent 1972 ) .",
    "the main source of the differences ( @xmath4 0.2 dex ) with the values derived by garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) comes from the adopted electron temperatures .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) use higher electron temperatures ( by 1900 k and 2300 k respectively for the nw and se components ) as derived from recent mmt spectral observations in apertures which match more closely those of the hst fos observations used to obtain carbon abundances .",
    "thus , despite the extensive multiwavelength studies of i  zw  18 , its evolutionary status remains controversial .",
    "increasing evidence is accumulating , however , in favor of the idea that this bcd underwent its first episode of star formation less than 100 myr ago .",
    "the first line of evidence is based on heavy element abundance ratios .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) have studied these ratios in a sample of low - metallicity bcds .",
    "they found that all galaxies with heavy element mass fraction @xmath9 @xmath3 @xmath10/20 , including i zw 18 , show constant c / o and n / o abundance ratios which can be explained by element production in massive stars ( @xmath11 @xmath12 9 @xmath13 ) only .",
    "intermediate - mass stars ( 3 @xmath13 @xmath3 @xmath11 @xmath14 9 @xmath13 ) in these galaxies have not had time to die and release their c and n production .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) put an upper limit to the age of the order of 100 myr for these most metal - deficient galaxies .",
    "the chemical evidence for a young age of galaxies with @xmath9 @xmath3 @xmath10/20 is supported by photometric and spectroscopic evidence .",
    "thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1997 ) and papaderos et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have argued , on the basis of colour profiles and spectral synthesis studies , that the second most metal - deficient galaxy known after i zw 18 , the bcd sbs 0335052 with @xmath9 @xmath4 @xmath10/40 , is a young galaxy with age less than 100 myr . using the same techniques in addition to colour - magnitude diagram studies , thuan , izotov & foltz ( 1999a )",
    "have shown that the age of the bcd sbs 1415 + 437 with @xmath9 @xmath4 @xmath10/21 is also less than 100 myr .    in view of the contradictory conclusions reached by different authors based on the same hst data set , we have decided to address anew the issue of the age of i zw 18 by reexamining the hst data",

    "a number of distinct super - shells are visible within this lsb envelope of the main body , testimony to a large scale perturbation of the surrounding gaseous component and suggesting that emission by ionized gas contributes a significant fraction of the integrated luminosity of the system .",

    "the number density of the ambient neutral gas @xmath70 can be estimated from h i column densities ( van zee et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it varies from @xmath4 1 @xmath35 in the central part of the main body where the inner shell is observed , to @xmath4 0.05 @xmath35 at the distance of @xmath4 1 kpc from the main body where the largest shells are seen .",
    "we adopt two limiting values @xmath70 = 0.1 and 1 @xmath35 , within the range of number densities discussed by martin ( 1996 ) . the wr stage in an instantaneous burst at @xmath9",
    "@xmath4 @xmath10/50 is short , @xmath69 @xmath4 0.1 ( de mello et al .",
    "then , the radius of the shell produced by stellar winds of wr stars is @xmath64 @xmath4 110 pc , if @xmath70 = 1 @xmath35 and @xmath4 170 pc , if @xmath70 = 0.1 @xmath35 , in good agreement with the observed radius @xmath4 100 pc of the inner shell .",
    "however , stellar winds alone can not explain the presence of larger structures .",
    "consider next the combined effect of supernovae . in the nw component",
    ", the formation of structures with radii as large as 1200 pc should be accounted for . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the number of supernovae to be equal to the number of o stars .",
    "the latter can be estimated from the total observed flux of the h@xmath6 emission line .",
    "the h@xmath6 flux in table [ tab3 ] can not be used as it has not been corrected for aperture effects .",
    "instead , we adopt the aperture - corrected h@xmath6 flux from guseva et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , giving a number of o stars equal to 4800 . adopting @xmath69 = 0.5 for the age of the main body , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sn ] ) gives @xmath64 = 550 pc and 350 pc for @xmath70 = 0.1 @xmath35 and 1 @xmath35 respectively .",
    "to explain the presence of structures with radii as large as 1200 pc , the age for the nw component should be as high as 18  39 myr , larger than the age of @xmath4 5 myr inferred from ionization constraints and the presence of wr stars .",
    "we conclude therefore that the stellar clusters in the nw and se components ionizing the gas in the main body can not be responsible for the largest structures , and these are due to the action of older clusters and stellar associations .",
    "the largest shell to the west of the nw component with radius 800 pc is likely to be connected with the stellar association located at 4  to the nw of the nw component , near its center of symmetry . if we assume that a starburst occurred 10 myr ago , that there were as many o stars as in the nw component and @xmath70 = 0.1 @xmath35 , then @xmath64 = 840 pc . because of the weak dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath72 and @xmath69 ( eq . [ eq : sn ] )",
    "even a burst 10 times weaker with an age of 20 myr can account for the radius of the largest shell .",
    "hence , star formation in the main body of i zw 18 is likely to have started @xmath4 20 myr ago , propagating generally from the nw to the se direction , and continuing the star formation started earlier in the c component .",
    "this age estimate is in agreement with the one derived by martin ( 1996 ) with the use of a more complex model of the gas distribution , and of the smaller distance of 10 mpc .",
    "our main goal here is to use observed properties of the blue compact dwarf galaxy i zw 18 to put constraints on its age : the high ionization state of the gas and the presence of wr stars in the main body , the existence of ionized gas in the c component , and the colour - magnitude diagrams from hst images .",
    "we were motivated by the study of izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) who have analyzed the c / o and n / o abundance ratios of a sample of the most metal - deficient bcds known , including i zw 18 . those authors found that these ratios are constant for galaxies with @xmath9 @xmath3 @xmath10/20 with a very small dispersion around the mean .",
    "this strongly suggests that intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath11 @xmath3 8 @xmath13 ) have not had time to release their carbon and primary nitrogen production , establishing an age upper limit of @xmath4 100 myr for very metal - deficient bcds .    the conclusion that galaxies with @xmath9 @xmath3 @xmath10 / 20 are younger than 100 myr has been supported by photometric and spectroscopic studies of two very metal - deficient bcds , sbs 0335052 ( @xmath10/40 , thuan et al .",
    "1997 , papaderos et al . 1998 ) and sbs 1415 + 437 ( thuan et al .",
    "1999a ) . here",
    "we examine the age evidence for i zw 18 . to put constraints on the age of i zw 18",
    ", we have followed 3 independent lines of investigation : colour - magnitude diagram , spectral synthesis and hydrodynamical age constraints .",
    "we have arrived at the following main conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the distance to i zw 18 must be increased by a factor of 2 from the previously adopted value of 10 mpc to 20 mpc .",
    "such a distance is required to have stars bright and massive enough in i zw 18 to account for its high state of ionization and the presence of wolf - rayet stars in its nw component .",
    "( @xmath49 ) vs. @xmath1 and ( @xmath43 ) vs. @xmath2 cmd studies with the new distance of 20 mpc give ages derived from the main sequence turn - off of i zw 18 of @xmath4 15 myr and @xmath4 5 myr for the c component and main body respectively .",
    "the location of the resolved luminous red stars with @xmath76 @xmath4 6 mag and ( @xmath43 ) @xmath4 0.6  1.0 mag is consistent with an age @xmath3 100 myr for the c component .",
    "the star formation in this component is likely to have stopped 15  20 myr ago . as for the main body",
    ", cmd analysis implies that star formation started 20  50 myr ago and still continues nowadays .",
    "analysis of shell structures seen in h@xmath5 images also suggests that star formation in the main body began @xmath4 20 myr ago in different locations at the nw side and has been propagating mainly in the se direction .",
    "the age upper limit of @xmath4 50 myr derived for the main body is a whole order of magnitude smaller that the one derived by aloisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from cmd analysis of similar hst data .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the increase in distance of i zw 18 by a factor of 2 .      in summary , all three lines of investigation ( cmds , the distribution of h@xmath5 shells and spectroscopy ) lead to the same conclusion , that i zw 18 did not start to form stars until @xmath3 100 myr ago .",
    "this supports the contention of izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) that all very metal - deficient galaxies ( @xmath9 @xmath3 @xmath10/20 ) are young .",
