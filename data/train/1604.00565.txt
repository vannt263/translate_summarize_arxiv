    "massive multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) system has great potential for 5th generation wireless communication technologies @xcite where base station ( bs ) equipped with 100 s of antennas serves 10 s of mobile terminals ( mts ) with single or few antennas .",
    "current standards like lte , 802.11 ( wifi ) , 802.16 ( wimax ) etc already have provision of up to 8 antennas @xcite .",
    "massive mimo is front runner among communication technologies for future in context of data rates , spectral efficiency , energy efficiency and cancellation of channel fades @xcite .",
    "large scaling of antenna has put several new issues , some of which like channel modeling , antennas space constraint , channel training , limited coherence time at higher mobility and higher frequency , still need an intensified research . + channel modeling for massive mimo is one of the basic issues raised in @xcite because it provides an analytical testing framework for the designers of communication schemes and cellular structure . however , channel models for small scale mimo are in literature for a long time like a correlation based stochastic channel model ( cbscm ) for wide band mimo system , is provided in @xcite and a geometry based stochastic channel model ( gbscm ) for multi - link mimo communication is provided in @xcite .",
    "but , the aforementioned channel models are not directly suitable for massive mimo .",
    "theoretical studies for massive mimo typically consider either independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "complex gaussian channel model alone @xcite or with multiplication of a diagonal matrix describing large scale fading @xcite . a need for new channel model for massive mimo is suggested in @xcite based on measured channel .",
    "a non - stationary 3-d wideband twin - cluster model for massive mimo is provided in @xcite where most of the underlying physical phenomena are included in channel model which can provide a good framework if different propagation parameters like mobility , geometry of clusters etc . can be collected precisely . however",
    ", managing all these parameters while analyzing a communication scheme using this channel model , is again a challenge .",
    "moreover , a better insights on a communication scheme can be obtained by using a simplified analytical channel model @xcite . however , the channel model used in @xcite , has implicit assumption of i.i.d .",
    "channel coefficients and it was specific to non line of sight ( nlos ) scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "cbscms are not sufficient to model spatial determinism in the channel as well as cbscms can simulate correlation along only one dimension .",
    "thus , there is a need for a channel model which can provide a simplified analytical expression for the channel and can simulate temporal , frequential and spatial variation simultaneously .",
    "however , even doing so , it must be able to simulate underlying propagation phenomena like the @xcite .",
    "+ this paper presents a statistical analytical channel model for massive mimo where different underlying physical phenomena are modeled into statistical parameters of channel model while keeping the controlling parameters minimum .",
    "this work considers a multiuser massive mimo system with block fading channel .",
    "block fading assumption for channel , resembles with practical scenario for cellular communication e.g. lte .",
    "the important aspect of this channel model is that the most of the details of channel are folded into three controlling parameters ( matrices ) making the channel model suitable for analytic evaluation of communication schemes .",
    "parameters of analytic expression of channel model , are well connected to temporal , frequential and spatial variations .",
    "this work reveals the hidden aspects of antenna - phase relationship which was not observed in experimental measurement of @xcite , possibly due to longer period per measurement ( around half an hour ) .",
    "simulation results on distribution of eigenvalues , user - correlation and average received power along array dimension , resemble with measured data @xcite .",
    "this channel model identifies the spatial determinism property of channel vectors which provides a new insight on propagation aspects .",
    "simulation result on average statistics of channel , again , provides a new insight on unfavorable propagation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) aspects of channel .",
    "+ rest of the paper is organized in following sections .",
    "section ii describes the system model with detailed explanation of underlying physical phenomena , section iii shows insights on simulated channel with proper explanation , section iv validates the channel model by comparing parameters of simulated channel model with existing measured channel parameters and section v draws out conclusion .",
    "considering a practical system like lte , the time - frequency resources ( total of @xmath0 ) for a wireless cellular system , under block fading , can be divided into rbs as follows .",
    "@xmath1    let a cellular massive mimo system has @xmath2 active mobile terminals ( mts ) and one bs with @xmath3 antennas .",

    "+      to extend the effect of underlying propagation phenomena from single antenna system to mimo ( or massive mimo ) , antenna - phase relation needs to be clarified . in single antenna system",
    ", there is no significant role of random phase because whatever cumulative random phase is there , it is tracked by pll at receiver but in case of mimo ( or massive mimo ) , random phases across antennas , also play role in creating uncorrelated channel vectors .",
    "thus , there is a need to account two factors to model the channel for massive mimo : one is that instead of considering rician distribution ( only for amplitude distribution ) , complex non zero mean gaussian distribution ( which is the origin of rician distribution ) is to be considered .",
    "the second factor is that the deterministic antenna - phase relation must be considered in addition to the first factor because unfavorable propagation condition , in massive mimo system , is some sort of drift from random to deterministic antenna - phase relationship .",
    "determinism in antenna - phase relation is a function of angular spread of incoming radiation from a cluster .",

    "here it is important to note that this relationship describes only deterministic part of antenna - phase relationship . over all variation of phase across antennas",
    "is also contributed by random phases . if instantaneous received power at @xmath28 bs antenna from @xmath29 mt via @xmath24 cluster , is @xmath30 then , it is simple to follow that total average power at @xmath28 bs antenna from @xmath29 mt is sum of the average received powers from all clusters i.e.    @xmath31 $ ] where ,    @xmath32    here channel coefficients are considered uncorrelated across the clusters . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 elements of @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively . @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote spatial mean and spatial standard deviation of @xmath36 respectively where @xmath36 is the channel gain for @xmath35 link through @xmath24 cluster .",
    "@xmath23 is used to simulate temporal & frequential variation and correlation .",
    "this type of channel matrix can be generated using its temporal or frequential ( along rb index ) covariance matrix . since @xmath37 is the @xmath35 element of @xmath23 thus , the matrix + @xmath38 + is the set of channel coefficients in different rbs for communication link between @xmath28 bs antenna and @xmath29 mt via @xmath24 cluster when the channel coefficients are i.i.d .",

    "following description is given regarding the method to generate spatial variation controlling matrices :    * a given cluster subtends an angle on bs antenna array depending on its size and distance from receiver thus , incoming radiation from a cluster has angular spread approximately equal to the subtended angle .",
    "incoming radiation of limited angular spread , is equivalent to a significant component in certain direction which can be modeled by non - zero mean complex gaussian distribution ( rician distribution in amplitude ) with a variance and mean depending on angular spread , direction of cluster and average received power from cluster .",
