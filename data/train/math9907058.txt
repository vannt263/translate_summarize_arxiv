    "<S> a version of a conjecture of mcmullen is as follows : given a hyperbolizable 3-manifold m with incompressible boundary , there exists a uniform constant k such that if n is a hyperbolic 3-manifold homeomorphic to the interior of m , then the injectivity radius based at points in the convex core of n is bounded above by k. this conjecture suggests that convex cores are uniformly congested . in previous work , the author has proven the conjecture for @xmath0-bundles over a closed surface , taking into account the possibility of cusps . in this paper , we establish the conjecture in the case that m is a book of i - bundles or an acylindrical , hyperbolizable 3-manifold . </S>",
