    "exciton - vibrational coupling ( evc ) plays an important role in the dynamics and spectroscopy of natural and artificial molecular aggregates.@xcite in particular the non - perturbative and non - markovian regime has attracted recent interest and a number of approaches have been developed to cope with such situations.@xcite often the signatures of strong evc are visible as vibrational side bands already in linear absorption or emission spectra.@xcite however , evc is not the only manifestation of the interaction between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "a frequent theme in the dynamics of excited electronic states of molecules are non - adiabatic transitions signifying the breakdown of the born - oppenheimer approximation.@xcite the topic of this contribution is the interplay between evc in exciton transfer and local non - adiabatic transitions .",
    "this issue has been intensively studied in the context of exciton - exciton annihilation.@xcite there highly excited states at energies about twice the excitation energy are involved .",
    "in contrast we focus on situations where the monomers comprising the aggregate have overlapping electronic transitions . in terms of exciton theory",
    "this will lead to the emergence of two excitonic bands being connected by interband transitions which are due to non - adiabatic couplings .",
    "this situation did not receive much attention so far , although it should be rather common for many dyes .",
    "for instance , kobayashi and coworkers have made vibronic coupling ( herzberg - teller coupling ) between q and b state derived exciton manifolds responsible for observed vibrational dynamics after q - band excitation in porphyrin type j - aggregates .",
    "@xcite recently , q- and b - band dynamics of bisporphyrin have been stduied using transient absorption and two - dimensional spectroscopy.@xcite transient absorption data revealed time scales of associated intraband relaxation and s@xmath0-s@xmath1 internal conversion in the few hundred femtosecond regime .",
    "interband transitions have also been discussed for tubular aggregates @xcite . however , in that case the excitonic manifolds correspond to different structural elements such as inner and outer tubes which have some residual electronic coupling . as a note of caution",
    "we stress that the present non - adiabatic coupling between different _ local _ electronic states should not be confused with the discussion of non - adiabaticity in the context of the potential energy surfaces ( pes ) coupled via the coulomb interaction between different monomers @xcite .",
    "this also holds true for studies of molecular complexes that are not treated as an aggregate but a supermolecule . for example ,",
    "leutwyler and coworkers interpreted splittings at the electronic band origin of and transitions of hydrogen - bonded homo - dimers in terms of excitonic coupling quenched by nuclear tunneling .",
    "@xcite    the situation we will focus on is illustrated in fig .",
    "for the case of a dimer with one harmonic vibrational coordinate and three electronic states for each monomer .",
    "the lowest state , ( s@xmath2,s@xmath2 ) , corresponds to the situation where both monomers are in their electronic ground state , s@xmath2 .",
    "next in energy there are two diabatic pes corresponding to the situation where a single s@xmath2-s@xmath1 type excitation is present , either in monomer 1 ( s@xmath1,s@xmath2 ) or 2 ( s@xmath2,s@xmath1 ) . for the depicted symmetric case the two pes intersect along the diagonal of the plot . in the adiabatic representation one",

    "the different excitation states of the dimer are indicated.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the two types of state couplings will manifest themselves in the absorption spectral lines shapes .",
    "furthermore , one might think of interesting quantum dynamical implications .",
    "for instance , consider the limiting case where a system initially prepared in a local s@xmath0 excitation will evolve either in the s@xmath0 manifold or after non - adiabatic transition in the s@xmath1 manifold . which dynamics is relevant",
    "will depend on the ratio of non - adiabatic and coulomb coupling .",
    "in fact if both are of the same magnitude intra- and interband transfer may be strongly mixed .",
    "an important aspect for the dynamics is the coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom because it influences both local non - adiabatic transitions and transfer ( e.g. shifts of pes ) . in general",
    ", it will not be a single vibrational mode that mediates both processes .    in the present contribution the scenario of fig .",
    "will be studied for the exemplary case of a modified perylene bisimide ( pbi ) dye forming j - aggregates in solution @xcite .",
    "the choice of the system is motivated by our previous studies , which focussed on the quantum chemical and spectroscopic characterization of monomers and small aggregates .",

    "the effect of j - aggregation on the spectrum is seen , independent of the coupling strength @xmath74 , i.e. the red - most band of the spectrum increases in intensity relative to the higher energetic part . because of the higher coulomb coupling strength between the s@xmath1 states as compared with the s@xmath0 states the red shift is stronger in the band than in the band of the spectra .",

    "they partly overlap in the range of the 0 - 0 transition around 2.7 ev .",
    "the effect of increasing the lvc constant is most notable in the band although some oscillator strength redistribution is observed even for the low - energy part ( 2.1 - 2.3 ev ) of the band . in case of the dimer ( fig .",
    "( c , d ) ) the part of the spectrum is less affected by the lvc and in fact the effect of increasing the aggregate to a trimer ( fig .",
    "( e , f ) ) has a more pronounced influence .",
    "clearly the derived band is shaped by the coulomb coupling .",
    "in contrast for the band both lvc and coulomb couplings play a role . besides the mere magnitude of the couplings it is the energetic position of the ci which is responsible for this behavior ( cf .",

    "most important in this respect are those high - frequency modes with a large huang - rhys - factor for the s@xmath0 states , which give rise to low lying ci s .    summarizing fig .",
    "it can be stated that ( i ) given the approximations involved the experimental monomer and aggregate spectra are reasonably reproduced and ( ii ) based on these spectra alone , the magnitude of the lvc strength can not be unambiguously determined .",
    "we note , however , that value beyond the used 0.1 ev lead to markedly different absorption spectra and therefore can be excluded .      whereas the low - resolution spectra do not show a pronounced dependence on the lvc strength over a reasonable parameter range , the population dynamics is , of course , rather sensitive to this parameter .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the left and right columns of fig .  .",
    "for the larger value @xmath81 ev the s@xmath0 to s@xmath1 interband population transfer is almost complete within 400 fs for all cases .",

    "the interband decay becomes faster when going from the monomer to the dimer , but slows down if the aggregate is increased to a trimer .",

    "first , the energetic position of the ci decreases with increasing aggregate size due to the influence of the coulomb coupling ( see fig .  ) .",
    "since this leads to a better resonance at the vertical transition energy of the wave packet , the population transfer becomes faster as seen in the dimer case .",
    "however , as noted before the wave packet reaches the ci only after being backscattered from the repulsive wall in @xmath93 direction .",
    "this is in contrast to the monomer case where already the initial motion of the wave packet would be towards the ci .",
    "the broadening of the wave packet associated with the backscattering causes a less effective interband transfer in the weak lvc case .",
    "the effect of backscattering is quantified in fig .",
    "a where we plot the time - averaged reduced density differences @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 denote selected coordinates , @xmath97 includes all other coordinates and the index `` wj '' and `` woj '' indicates a propagation with and without coulomb interaction , respectively , up to final time @xmath98 .",
    "clearly , the presence of the coulomb coupling leads on average to less density in the range of the crossing seam . in the dimer case",
    "the shift of the ci still dominates the effect of wave packet spreading , making the interband transfer faster as compared with the monomer . for the trimer",
    "however , the increased number of vibrational degrees of freedom allows for a pronounced intraband redistribution of the wave packet on the s@xmath0 manifold what slows down the interband decay .    finally , we comment on the observation of oscillations in the strong lvc case in fig .  . in case of weak coupling",
    "there is some continuous but relatively small leakage of density out of the s@xmath0 states , whenever the wave packet hits the crossing region .",
    "in contrast for strong lvc the s@xmath0 population drops by about 40 % already on the first attempt .",
    "the subsequent oscillations are rather a signature of quantum interferences of parts the wave packet running on different states and being projected onto the diabatic electronic basis .",

    "b where we show the time - averaged density differences along two selected modes for the cases of small and large lvc in the dimer model",
    ". the wider spread of density for the larger lvc is clearly discernible .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that these oscillations are likely to disappear upon increasing the dimensionality of the model to approach a quasi - continuous spectrum of exciton - vibrational states .      .",

    "shows the subsequent population dynamics for two different values of the lvc strength .",
    "focussing on the dimer ( panel ( a ) ) one notices that for small @xmath74 exciton transfer between the two s@xmath0 excitation state dominates , while the s@xmath1 state becomes populated only slowly . upon increasing the lvc strength the local s@xmath0 state",
    "is rapidly deactivated and the transfer proceeds in the s@xmath1 manifold .",
    "this behavior carries over to the trimer in fig .",
    "c , d , where the delayed population of states corresponding to excitations along the aggregate is even more visible .",
    "the most surprising result is perhaps the behavior of the s@xmath1 state populations in the weak coupling case .",
    "their population rise resembles that of the cases shown in fig .",
    "c and e. this implies that the s@xmath1 band is gradually filled by the rapid energy transfer in the s@xmath0 band without showing any signature of s@xmath1 exciton transfer along the aggregate by it own .",
    "combining models from frenkel exciton transfer and linear vibronic coupling theory the interplay of local deactivation processes and intermolecular energy transfer was investigated for a monomer as well as a dimer and trimer pbi system in dependence on the lvc strength .",
    "although there is no obvious influence of lvc strength on low - resolution linear absorption spectra various features appeared in high - resolution spectra as well as in population and transfer dynamics , which can be explained by changes in the pes landscape due to the different couplings .",
    "most notable here are the two opposite effects of the coulomb coupling for a given lvc strength .",
    "first , the cis are energetically shifted what may favor resonance with the optically excited wave packet .",
    "second , in the coulomb coupled case the wave packet does not leave the franck - condon region in direction of the ci , but only after backscattering from repulsive parts of the pes . the accompanying wave packet spreading diminishes the efficiency for non - adiabatic transitions at least in the weak lvc case . as net effect",
    "internal conversion becomes faster when going from the monomer to the dimer , but slows down for the trimer .",

    "<S> the quantum dynamics of linear molecular aggregates in the presence of and transitions is investigated putting emphasis on the interplay between local non - adiabatic s@xmath0 to s@xmath1 deactivation and frenkel exciton transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical approach combines aspects of the linear vibronic coupling and frenkel exciton models . </S>",
    "<S> dynamics calculations are performed for the absorption spectrum and the electronic state populations using the multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree approach . as an application perylene bisimde j - type dimer and trimer aggregates are considered , including four tuning and one coupling mode per monomer . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a dynamical model comprising up to 7 electronic states and 15 vibrational modes . </S>",
    "<S> the unknown non - adiabatic coupling strength is treated as a parameter that is chosen in accordance with available absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves some flexibility that can be limited by the clearly distinguishable population dynamics . </S>"
