    "the study of topological and electrical structure of power transmission networks is an important area of research with several applications such as vulnerability analysis  @xcite , locational marginal pricing  @xcite , controlled islanding  @xcite , and location of sensors  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on two interrelated problems : @xmath3 graph - based modeling and characterization of power transmission networks , and @xmath4 random graph models for synthetic generation of transmission networks .",
    "these two problems have a significant impact on several aspects of our understanding and functioning of the power grid .",
    "r0.5        graph - theoretic approaches have been studied extensively in the context of power grids ( section  [ sec : related ] ) .",
    "however , there are several limitations that need to be addressed .",
    "for example , power grids have been characterized using graph - theoretic metrics to show conflicting features  @xcite , and in the study of vulnerabilities to often misleading conclusions  @xcite .",
    "graph based models and algorithms are effective when vertices represent homogeneous entities in a consistent manner",
    ". however , _ a transmission network is inherently heterogeneous_. it consists of entities such as generators , loads , substations , transformers , and transmission lines that operate at different voltage ratings .",
    "further , power transformers are not always treated consistently .",
    "they are generally represented as edges , but not always .",
    "consequently , a purely graph - based model will misrepresent a transmission network when it is not constructed carefully .",
    "as an example , illustration of a model for the power grid in poland is provided in figure  [ fig : polishall ] , where nodes operating at different voltages are shown in different colors and sizes  larger the size , higher the nominal voltage of a node .",
    "thus , edges connecting two different types of vertices are transformers . in this paper",
    ", we address the problem of accurate representation of power transmission networks as a graph , and discuss the impact of this representation for graph - theoretic characterization and modeling using random graph models .      by accurately modeling transformers , and consequently decomposing a network into regions of different voltage ratings ,",
    "we propose a novel network - of - networks model for power transmission networks .",
    "this simple idea has profound implications to the study of topological and electrical structure of power grids .",
    "the contributions we make in this paper are : @xmath3 a new decomposition method for power transmission networks using nominal voltage ratings of entities ( section  [ sec : characterization ] ) ; @xmath4 empirical evidence of the hierarchical nature of transmission networks based on the analysis of real - world data representing the north american and european grids ( section  [ sec : characterization ] and [ sec : interconnection ] ) ; @xmath5 characterization of the interconnection structure between networks of different voltages ( section  [ sec : interconnection ] ) ; and @xmath6 presentation of random graph models  two methods for modeling the network at a specific voltage level , and one method for modeling the interconnection structure of networks of different voltage ( section  [ sec : randomgraphmodel ] ) .",
    "an electric power transmission network consists of power generators , loads , transformers , substations , and branches connecting different components .",
    "while branches and transformers are modeled as edges of a graph , all the other components ( buses ) are modeled as vertices .",
    "while this model is fairly consistent , the inclusion of transformers as edges makes the graph representation inconsistent .",
    "an illustration of a symbolic power system is shown in figure  [ blockdiagram ] .",
    "generation is shown in black , transmission is shown in blue , and distribution in green .",
    "an illustration of a power system .",
    "power generation , shown in black , is connected to distribution , shown in green , via a transmission system , shown in blue .",
    "the system operates at different voltage ratings as shown in the figure.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    a power transformer is used to step up or step down voltage between its two end - points , and therefore , connects two different regions of voltage magnitudes .",
    "power transmitted at a certain voltage remains at that level unless stepped up or stepped down by another transformer connecting the network to a region of different voltage rating .",
    "therefore , the component of the network transmitting power at a certain voltage rating can be treated as one network where all the vertices consistently represent entities operating at the same voltage rating , and edges represent transmission lines .",
    "the overall transmission network can thus be decomposed into a _ network - of - networks _ ( defined further below ) , where each network operates at a certain voltage rating , and a pair of networks are connected via one or more transformers regulating the voltage levels . when expressed in this manner ,",
    "a different graph structure emerges , which is the focus of our study .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is a pair , where the vertex set @xmath1 represents unique entities and the edge set @xmath2 represents binary relations on @xmath1 .",
    "we define a network - of - networks model for power transmission as an undirected heterogenous graph @xmath7 with a weight function @xmath8 .",
    "the vertex set @xmath1 represents unique entities such as substations , generators and loads ; the edge set @xmath2 represents binary relationships on @xmath1 such that an edge @xmath9 represents either a power transmission line or a voltage transformer ; a set @xmath10 of values associated with @xmath1 representing the nominal voltage rating at a particular vertex as defined in the mapping function @xmath11 where each vertex operates at a given voltage level @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a positive real number .",
    "a set @xmath14 of values associated with @xmath2 represent the type of an edge  a transmission line or a transformer  as defined in the mapping function @xmath15 where each edge is of a given type @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is an integer .",
    "traditionally , transmission networks are represented as graphs , making no distinction between entities operating at different voltage ratings and edges of different types . in our representation ,",
    "the vertex and edge types ( @xmath18 ) , and the mappings ( @xmath19 ) , allow us to make clear distinctions between different vertex and edge types .",
    "given the voltage levels for each substation ( @xmath20 ) , we can automatically detect the voltage transformers , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . by pruning the transformer - edges from @xmath24 , the remaining graph represents a collection of subgraphs where each subgraph has vertices operating at the same voltage level and edges that are transmission lines .",
    "the structure of this collection of subgraphs is of great interest in studying the transmission network and is the focus of this paper .",
    "* graph - theoretic measures : * we use the following graph - theoretic measures in this paper .",
    "a _ path _ in a graph is a finite sequence of edges such that every edge in a path is traversed only once and any two consecutive edges in a path are adjacent to each other ( share a vertex in common ) .",
    "the _ average shortest - path length _ is defined as the average of shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices in a graph .",
    "the longest shortest - path is called the _",
    "diameter _ of a graph",
    ". the _ local clustering coefficient _ of a vertex @xmath25 is the ratio between the actual number of edges among the neighbors of @xmath25 to the total possible number of edges among these neighbors .",
    "the _ average clustering coefficient _ of a graph is the sum of all local clustering coefficients of its vertices divided by the number of vertices .",

    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now present the details of the interconnection structure of western and eastern interconnects computed using algorithm  [ algo.interconnect ] .",
    "key details are summrized in table  [ interconnect ] .",
    "we note that the interconnection graphs of the polish and texas interconnect are small and unsuitable for analysis .",
    "the topological properties of the interconnection networks is substantially different from the properties of the decomposed networks presented in section  [ sec : characterization ] . while the average clustering coefficient of these networks are higher , the average shortest path and diameter are significantly smaller ( relative to decomposed networks ) .",
    "the fundamental differences in the topological structure is also evident from the visualization of the two systems presented in figure  [ fig : interconnect ] .    from the interconnection graphs we observe a hierarchical nature of the manner in which different networks at different voltages interconnect with each other .",
    "the lowest voltage levels are used for distribution purposes and generally form degree - one vertices in the interconnection networks .",
    "the remaining vertices ( networks of higher voltage ) form a hierarchical structure spanning the network . in order to highlight this feature",
    ", we present a @xmath40-core of the interconnection network of the eastern interconnect in figure  [ fig : interconnect2core ] .",
    "the @xmath51-core of a graph is a subgraph of the graph such that each vertex has degree @xmath51 or more .",
    "we will conclude this section by observing that the topological structure of the interconnection network is significantly different from the topological structure of the decomposed networks operating at the same voltage level .",
    "further , there exists a hierarchical structure based on the voltage levels to the manner in which different vertices are linked to one another .",
    "an important research topic in the study of electric power grids is the ability to synthetically generate graphs that match the characteristics of real - world power grids .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed analysis of different random graph models and their comparison to real - world datasets .",
    "we summarize key findings from previous work in section  [ sec : related ] . in this section ,",
    "we present two random graph models to generate graphs that match the characteristics of graphs at a given voltage level that were presented in section  [ sec : characterization ] .",
    "we then present graph models that match the characteristics of the interconnection structure that we presented in section  [ sec : interconnection ] . by combining the two separate models",
    ", we propose that synthetic graphs can be generated to match the overall characteristics of real - world power grids .",
    "we first present two random graph models to generate graphs at a given voltage .",
    "these two models can be seen as a variant of the random geometric graphs  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath52-dimensional random geometric graph , @xmath53 , is a graph formed by randomly placing @xmath54 vertices in a @xmath52-dimensional space and adding an edge between pairs of vertices whose euclidean distance is less than or equal to @xmath55 .",
    "sparsity and structure of the generated graph can be controlled by varying the distance parameter @xmath55 .",
    "we note here that we experimented with several random graph models and found that the random geometric graph models to be the most promising  @xcite . here",
    ", we present two such models . the first model is given in algorithm  [ algo.simplemindist ] .",
    "the algorithm takes the size of the graph ( number of vertices and edges ) as the input , and generates a random graph as the output .",
    "the algorithm starts generating @xmath54 two - dimensional points uniformly at random ( line @xmath56 in algorithm  [ algo.simplemindist ] ) . for each vertex @xmath57 ,",
    "a set of @xmath58 neighbors are chosen by minimizing the euclidean distance as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the adjacency set of vertex @xmath57 .",
    "an additional edge is generated with with probability @xmath61 ( line @xmath62 in algorithm  [ algo.simplemindist ] ) .",
    "randomly generate planar coordinates for @xmath57 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) from a uniform distribution generate @xmath58 edges ( @xmath65 ) by iteratively selecting @xmath66 to minimize the euclidean distance between @xmath57 and @xmath66 using equation  [ eq : mindist ]    generate an additional edge with probability @xmath61 using equation  [ eq : mindist ]    graphs generated by algorithm  [ algo.simplemindist ] do not match all the desired properties of power grids .",
    "therefore , we consider an adapted version of this algorithm that modifies how vertices get connected using the distance function given by equation  [ eq : mindist ] .",
    "the modification is driven by a bisection cost @xmath67 .",
    "unlike the previous algorithm , new nodes can either be connected to an existing node through a new edge , or it can be placed near an existing edge and become a bisecting node for that edge .",
    "this change is motivated by economical considerations in the construction of power transmission networks .",
    "for example , consider the construction of a new town that needs to connect to the power grid .",
    "the town can either be connected via a transmission line or feeder to an existing substation , or a new substation could be built , bisecting an existing transmission line . with this modification , the min - dist selection criteria ( eq . [ eq : mindist ] )",
    "is modified as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the distance between point @xmath57 and the nearest point along line segment @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is an exogenously selected bisection cost .",
    "if @xmath72 is smaller than @xmath73 , then the algorithm creates a new edge @xmath74 .",
    "otherwise , the new node bisects the existing edge @xmath70 .",
    "the second step in generating synthetic transmission networks is to generate random graphs to match the characteristics of the interconnection graphs .",
    "we propose the use of preferential attachment ( pa ) model for this purpose .",
    "we generate the preferential attachment ( pa ) graphs using the algorithm proposed in  @xcite .",
    "since we aim to generate graphs of a given size ( number of vertices , @xmath54 , and edges @xmath75 ) , we modify the algorithm in @xcite to allow for a fractional average degree @xmath76 . for each new vertex @xmath57",
    ", @xmath58 edges are added by linking @xmath57 to an existing vertex @xmath66 , where @xmath66 is chosen randomly from the probability distribution @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the degree of vertex @xmath79 .",
    "further , an additional edge @xmath80 is added with probability @xmath81 to generate a preferential attachment graph with @xmath54 vertices and approximately @xmath75 edges .",
    "we generate erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs by randomly adding edges between a pair of vertices until there are exactly @xmath75 edges in the graph .",
    "further details are provided in  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : degdistint ] , we provide the cumulative degree distribution of the interconnection graphs of the western and eastern interconnects ( described in section  [ sec : interconnection ] ) along with degree distributions from random graphs",
    " preferential attachment ( pa ) and erds - rnyi ( er ) of the same sizes .",
    "we observe that preferential attachment provides a better fit to the degree distribution of interconnection graphs .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that accurate models for synthetic recreation of transmission networks should include several aspects such as geography , cost of adding vertices and edges , size and distribution of power transformers , and the inherent hierarchy of networks of different voltage ratings .",
    "while we present a multi - step process involving different random graph models , careful construction and validation is part of our work in the near future .",
    "many researchers have explored the use of random graphs to model power grid @xcite , but in each case the resulting random graph does not fully model the structure of interest . in most cases , authors attempt to match graph characteristics from power grid networks , such as degree distribution , average path length , and clustering coefficient , in their random models .    in @xcite",
    "the author examines how vulnerability tests on the western interconnect ( wecc ) and the nordic grid , and then compare with the same tests on an erds - rnyi ( er ) random graph and the scale - free model of barabsi and albert @xcite .",
    "they first note that the clustering coefficient and average path length of the real graphs are significantly larger than that of both types of random graphs .",
    "when comparing vulnerability to failure of generators ( i.e. , removal of vertices ) they see that the real networks show more susceptibility than the random networks .",
    "the authors of @xcite also show that the topological properties of the eastern united states power grid and the ieee 300 system differ significantly from random networks created using preferential - attachment , small - world , and er models .",
    "they provide a new model , the minimum distance graph , which more closely matches measured topological characteristics like degree distribution , clustering coefficient , diameter , and assortativity of the real networks .",
    "we build on these ideas in our work .",
    "extensions of the minimum - distance model are discussed in section  [ sec : randomgraphmodel ] .    in a more recent paper by some of the same authors @xcite they look more specifically at both the electrical and topological connectivity of three north american power infrastructures .",
    "they again compare these with random , preferential - attachment , and small - world networks and see that these random networks differ greatly from the real power networks .",
    "they propose to represent electrical connectivity of power systems using electrical distances rather than physical connectivity and geographic connections .",
    "in particular , they propose a distance based on sensitivity between active power transfers and nodal phase angle differences .",
    "electrical distance is calculated as a positive value for all pairs of vertices which then yields a complete weighted graph .",
    "therefore , to make it more comparable to a geographic network the authors use a threshold value and keep those edges which are below the threshold .",
    "pagani and aiello , in @xcite , present a survey of the most relevant work using complex network analysis to study the power grid . in this survey",
    "they remark that most of the networks studied were high voltage from either north america , europe , or china .",
    "they remark that most of the surveyed work show that degree distribution is exponential .",
    "the geography of the country seems to be important as the results differ somewhat between countries with differing geographies .",
    "one point of agreement between all studies is that the power grid is resilient to random failures but extremely vulnerable to attacks targeting nodes with high degree or high betweenness scores .",
    "finally , we cite the work in @xcite in which the authors characterize many graph measures in the context of power grid graphs . as an example , they show that power grids are sparsely connected , the degree distribution has an exponential tail , and the line impedance has a heavy - tailed distribution . based on their findings",
    "they propose an algorithm to generate random power grids which features the same topology and electrical characteristics discovered from real data .",
    "they , like us , take a hierarchical approach to generating synthetic power networks",
    ". however , their approach differs by looking at geographic zones , whereas our approach is to break up the network by voltage level .",
    "our approach requires no geographic knowledge of the system and leads to a systematic approach for annotating the nodes and edges with different electrical properties such as voltage ratings .",
    "graph - theoretic analysis of power grids has often resulted in misleading conclusions . in this paper , we hypothesized that one of the reasons for such conclusions is the inability to account for heterogeneity in a power grid .",
    "we therefore developed a new method for decomposition based on nominal voltage rating , and using power transformers to generate a network - of - networks model of power transmission networks . while the individual networks operating at the same voltage level are characterized by exponential degree distribution , large values for average shortest - path length and diameter , and low clustering coefficient ; the interconnection structure representing the interconnection of these networks is characterized by non - exponential degree distribution , small values for average shortest - path length and diameter , and relatively higher clustering coefficient .",
    "consequently , we proposed two random graph methods for synthetic generation of power transmission networks .",
    "our approach not only models the topology , but also provides a method for annotating the network with voltage ratings so that the electrical properties of a grid can be modeled correctly . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this approach is novel .",
    "the resulting characterization of power transmission networks and the ability to synthetically recreate networks has important implications for studying the vulnerability of power systems , evolution of power networks , and transmission expansion planning .",
    "thus , the ideas proposed in this paper hold the potential to significantly improve our understanding of several aspects of electric infrastructure networks , as well as other critical infrastructure networks .",
