    "for a long time , globular clusters ( gcs ) have been known as the fundamental laboratory for studying stellar structure and evolution , since they are considered to be composed of simple stellar populations ( ssp ) in which all member stars are formed at the same time with similar chemical abundance . however",
    ", this point of view is challenged by recent observations both from photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "for example , the splitting of main - sequence ( ms ) has been found in some massive gcs , such as @xmath1 cen ( bedin et al .",
    "2004 ) , ngc 2808 ( piotto et al .",
    "2007 ) etc .",
    "moreover , star to star variation of light elements ( e.g. , na - o , mg - al anticorrelation ) are found in most of the studied gcs ( carretta et al .",
    "2009 ; gratton et al .",
    "both the splitting of ms and light elements variation in gcs are considered to be possibly related to the self - enrichment scenario with helium enhancement ( dantona & caloi 2008 ; milone 2015 ; but also see jiang et al .",
    "2014 for an alternative solution ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the second generation stars are helium enhanced , since they are formed in the material polluted by the ejecta from either massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( ventura et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) or fast rotating massive stars ( decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) of the first generation .",
    "these second generation stars will occupy a bluer position on ms and horizontal branch ( hb ) stage than normal stars . in some gcs , the helium abundance for the second generation stars may reach as high as @xmath2 = 0.4 ( busso et al . 2007 ) .",
    "multiple populations in gcs are also found in late stellar evolution stage , such as hb .",
    "recently , na - o anticorrelation is also discovered in hb stars for many gcs ( gratton et al . 2013 , 2014 ) .",
    "marino et al .",
    "( 2014 ) analyzed nearly 100 hb stars with different temperatures in ngc 2808 and confirmed that some blue hb stars in this gc present higher helium abundance than primordial content by @xmath3 = 0.09 @xmath4 0.01 .",
    "this result provides direct observation constraints on the typical second - parameter problem in gcs which is a long - term puzzle in stellar evolution ( see catelan 2009 for a recent review ) . in 1960 ,",
    "sandage & wallerstein found that the position of hb stars on color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , which is defined as hb morphology , is mainly determined by metallicity of gcs .",
    "however , other parameters are also needed to explain the diversity of hb morphology in gcs , such as age ( lee et al . 1994 ; dotter et al . 2010 ; gratton et al .",
    "2010 ) , helium enhancement due to self - enrichment ( dantona et al . 2002",
    "; dantona & caloi 2004 ; milone et al .",
    "2014 ) , stellar rotation ( sweigart et al .",
    "1997 ) , binaries ( lei et al 2013a , 2013b , 2014 ; han et al . 2012 ; han & lei 2014 ) , dynamics ( pasquto et al .",
    "2013 , 2014 ) , etc .",
    "more complicated situations arise from the discovery for a special population of hot hb stars in some massive gcs , which are called the blue hook ( bhk ) stars ( whitney et al . 1998 ; dcruz et al .",
    "these stars occupy a very blue position on the hb but with fainter luminosity than the normal extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars . due to its high effective temperature ( e.g. , @xmath5 @xmath6 32000 k ; moni bidin et al . 2012 ) and faint luminosity",
    ", bhk star can not be explained by canonical stellar evolution theory , and its formation mechanism is still unclear .",
    "there are several scenarios having been proposed to explain the formation of bhk stars .",
    "brown et al . ( 2001 ) suggested that late hot flash scenario is one of the possible explanations . in this scenario ,",
    "the helium core flash of low mass stars may take place when the star is descending the white dwarf cooling curve if their progenitors undergo unusually huge mass loss on the red giant branch ( rgb ) stage . during the helium core flash , hydrogen in the envelope",
    "can be mixed into interior and burn into helium at higher temperature .",
    "thus , these stars show helium and carbon enhancement in the surface and occupy a bluer and fainter position than canonical ehb stars in the cmd of gcs .",
    "however , the physical mechanism for the huge mass loss on the rgb in late hot flash scenario is still unclear . on the other hand , lee ( 2005 )",
    "suggested that the bhk stars in @xmath1 cen and ngc 2808 are likely the progeny of a minority population of bluer and fainter ms stars which could be reproduced by assuming a large variations of primordial helium abundance ( e.g. , @xmath7 0.15 ) , while dantona et al .",
    "( 2010 ) proposed that if the blue ms stars found in @xmath1 cen are the progenitors of the bhk stars in this cluster , they need to suffer extra mixing processes on the rgb and increase their surface helium abundance up to @xmath8 0.8 .    in this paper",
    ", we followed the late hot flash scenario and suggested that tidally enhanced stellar wind in binary evolution is a possible formation channel for bhk stars in gcs . in binary evolution ,",
    "the mass loss of a red giant primary star could be largely enhanced by its companion star ( tout & eggleton 1988 ) , especially when the primary star nearly fills its roche lobe . in this scenario ,",
    "the mass loss of the red giant primary star depends on orbital period of the binary system .",
    "some of the primary stars may lost nearly the whole envelope before roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) is taking place due to a relative shorter orbital period .",
    "they evolve off the rgb and may experience helium core flash when descending the white dwarf cooling curve ( castellani & castellani 1993 ; dcruz et al .",
    "1996 ; brown et al . 2001 , 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "after the helium core flash , the star burns helium stably in its core and locates on the bhk regions in cmd of gcs . employing the detailed stellar evolution code , modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ; paxton et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) , we investigated the contributions of tidally enhanced stellar wind in binary evolution on the formation of bhk stars in gcs . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the code and models used in this paper .",
    "the results and comparison with observations are given in section 3 .",
    "finally , a discussion and conclusion are presented in section 4 and 5 respectively .",
    "the tidally enhanced stellar wind was firstly suggested by tout & eggleton ( 1988 ) to explain the mass inversion phenomenon ( e.g. , more evolved star has a low mass ) found in some binaries of rs cvn type ( popper & ulrich 1977 ; popper 1980 ) .",
    "they suggested that the secondary star may tidally enhance the stellar wind of the red giant primary star . by considering tidally enhanced stellar wind in binary evolution , they successfully explained the mass of z her which is a typical example of system with mass inversion phenomenon .",
    "recently , lei et al . ( 2013a , b ) also used this kind of wind to explain the hb morphology in gcs , but they did not consider the process of late hot flash and its effects on the formation of bhk stars .    since the torque due to tidal friction depends on @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the radius of the primary , while @xmath11 is the roche lobe radius of the primary .",
    "zahn 1975 ; campbell & papaloizou , 1983 ) , tout & eggleton ( 1988 ) used the following equation to describe the tidally enhanced stellar wind of the red giant primary : @xmath12\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the reimers mass - loss efficiency ( reimers 1975 ) , and @xmath14 is the efficiency of the tidal enhancement for the stellar wind .",
    "here @xmath10 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the radius , luminosity and mass of the primary in solar units .",
    "tout & eggleton introduced a saturation for @xmath17 in the above expression , because it is expected that the binary system is in complete corotation for @xmath18 . in this study , we set @xmath13 = 0.45 ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ; also see the discussion in sect 4.2 of lei et al .",
    "2013b ) , @xmath14 = 10000 ( e.g. , a typical value used in tout & eggleton 1988 ) .    to study the contribution of tidally enhanced stellar wind on the formation of bhk stars , equation ( 1 ) was added into the detailed stellar evolution code , modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ; paxton et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "mesa provides a variety of up - to - date physics modules , and it can evolve low mass stars through the helium core flash phase with details .",
    "furthermore , it offers the capacity that users can create zero age main - sequence ( zams ) and zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) models with different chemical compositions conveniently .",
    "we evolve binary systems using the binary module of mesa , version 6208 . in the study ,",
    "all the default values for input physics in mesa are used except for the opacity tables .",
    "opal type i opacity tables are the default ones for mesa , but opal type ii opacity tables allow time dependent variation of c and o abundances independent of initial metal distribution , thus it gives a better approximation of the appropriate opacities during and after helium burning .",
    "therefore , opal type ii opacity tables are used in this study .    in the calculation , the secondary stars are assumed to be ms stars and the mass ratio of primary to secondary is set to 1.6 ( see the discussion in sect 4 of lei et al .",
    "2013a for different values of @xmath19 ) .",
    "since what we concern is the primary star which may become a bhk star after undergoing huge mass loss on the rgb , we do not evolve the secondary star during the binary evolution . in our calculations , a moderate metallicity ,",
    "@xmath20 = 0.001 which is a typical value for gcs in our galaxy , is adopted , and a primordial helium abundance @xmath2 = 0.24 is adopted . in our models ,",
    "the mass of primary star at zams is 0.83@xmath21 which corresponds to an age of about 12 gyr at the rgb tip , and it is consistent with the typical age of gcs .",
    "we present in table 1 the main input parameters described above . from left to right , it gives the mass of primary star at zams , metallicity , helium abundance , mass ratio of primary to secondary , reimers mass loss efficiency and tidal enhancement efficiency , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we also give in table 2 the evolution parameters at zahb for the tracks shown in fig .",
    "1 . from left to right of table 2 , it presents the initial orbital period , stellar mass , helium core mass , effective temperature , luminosity , gravity , surface hydrogen mass fraction , surface helium mass fraction , surface carbon mass fraction and the flash status ( e.g. , what kind of flash does the primary star experience , normal means the star experiences a normal helium core flash at the rgb tip , early means it experiences an early hot flash when crossing the h - r diagram , late means it experiences a late hot flash when descending the white dwarf cooling curve , while wd means the primary star fails to ignite helium and dies as an helium white dwarf ) .",
    "one can see from table 2 that with the decreasing of initial orbital periods for the binaries , more envelope mass of the primary star is lost due to tidally enhanced stellar wind .",
    "though the early hot flasher ( e.g. , @xmath22 = 2000 d ) shows a little smaller helium core mass than the normal flasher ( e.g. , 0.4814 @xmath21 vs 0.4817 @xmath21 ) , its envelope mass is much less than the normal one ( e.g. , 0.0015 @xmath21 vs 0.0219 @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus , it results in a difference of about 8400 k for the zahb temperature between early hot flasher and normal flasher .",
    "however , the mass fractions of hydrogen , helium and carbon in the surface both for the early hot flasher and the normal one are nearly the same , which means that the chemical compositions in the surface of the two models are not changed by the helium core flash process . on the other hand , due to loss of nearly the whole envelope mass on the rgb , the late hot flasher ( i.e. , @xmath22 = 1610 d ) presents the smallest helium core mass and the thinnest envelope mass at zahb when comparing with the early hot flasher and the normal flasher . as predicted by brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the late hot flasher in table 2 shows hydrogen deficiency but helium and carbon enhancement in the surface . due to the highest helium abundance in the surface ( e.g. , 0.97 by mass ) and thinnest envelope mass , the late hot flasher presents highest effective temperature at zahb which is higher than early hot flasher about 5500 k and is higher than normal flasher for about 14000k .",
    "since the primary for @xmath22 = 1600 d becomes an helium white dwarf , we do not give the parameters for this model in table 2 .    according to our calculations ,",
    "@xmath22 = 2200 d is the minimum initial orbital period for which the primary stars would experience normal helium core flash at the rgb tip , while @xmath22 = 2000 d is the minimum initial orbital period for which the primary stars would experience early hot flash .",
    "that is to say , if the initial orbital periods are longer than @xmath22 = 2200 d , the primary stars would experience normal helium core flash at the rgb tip and become canonical hb stars ( e.g. , ehb , blue hb or red hb stars , see lei et al .",
    "2013a ) , while if the initial orbital periods are shorter than @xmath22 = 2200 d but longer than @xmath22 = 2000 d , the primary stars would experience early hot flash and become normal ehb stars .",
    "for 1600 d @xmath23 2000 d , the primary stars would undergo late hot flash when descending the white dwarf cooling curve and become bhk stars .",
    "however , if the initial orbital periods are shorter than @xmath22 = 1600 d , the primary stars would fail to ignite helium in the core due to too much mass loss on the rgb and become helium white dwarfs .",
    "cassisi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) firstly presented the evolution of a metal - poor low mass star from zams to post hb phase through a delayed helium core flash when the star is descending the white dwarf cooling curve . in their models , stars lose envelope mass on the rgb through reimers mass - loss law ( reimers 1975 ) .",
    "for the model undergoing late hot flash ( e.g. , @xmath13 = 0.60 in cassisi et al . 2003 ) , the mass fraction of hydrogen , helium and carbon in the surface is 4@xmath24 , 0.96 and 0.029 respectively . for our model in table 2 with an initial orbital period of @xmath22= 1610 d , which also experienced a late hot flash , the surface hydrogen , helium and carbon mass fraction are 1.4@xmath25 , 0.97 and 0.011 respectively .",
    "the slight difference for chemical abundance in surface between the model in cassisi et al . (",
    "2003 ) and ours may be due to the different mixing efficiency of the convective region used in the two model calculations ( also see the comparison in table 4 of miller bertolami et al .",
    "2008 between their results and the ones in cassisi et al .",
    "2003 ) .        in figure 2",
    ", we give the evolution parameters for one of our binary systems from zams to post hb , in which initial orbital period @xmath22 = 1610 d. the red - dashed line in fig .",
    "2 denotes the time when the primary helium core flash is taking place .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the ratio of stellar radius to roche lobe radius for the primary star vs model number .",
    "one can see from panel ( a ) that the envelope of the primary star expands from zams and gradually closes to the roche lobe radius until it reaches the rgb tip . according to equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "mass loss from tidally enhanced stellar wind become more and more stronger when the radius of the primary star is being closer to its roche lobe radius .",
    "this process is apparently shown in panel ( b ) , which gives the evolution of mass loss rate in logarithms ( i.e. , log__m _ _",
    "@xmath21/yr ) for the primary star . due to the huge mass loss on the rgb ,",
    "the star contracts and evolves off the rgb tip . at the same time , the mass loss of the star decreases accordingly .",
    "when the primary helium core flash takes place on the white dwarf cooling curve , we shut down the stellar wind of the star .",
    "one can see from panel ( a ) , there is a small second expansion for the radius of the star beyond the rgb tip .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hydrogen in the envelope was mixed into the inner region during the helium core flash and burned into helium at high temperature , which released large quantities of energy and push the envelope towards lower temperatures .",
    "panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "2 shows the period evolution of the binary vs model number .",
    "the orbital period of the binary becomes more and more longer until the star reaches the rgb tip ( e.g. , from 1610 d at zams to about 3000 d at the rgb tip ) due to the mass loss and angular momentum loss from the primary star . after the star evolving off the rgb tip , mass loss and angular momentum loss decrease largely ,",
    "thus it changes the orbital period a little .",

    "( 2007 ) , the surface abundance for helium , carbon and nitrogen were obtained for bhk stars and canonical ehb stars in @xmath1 cen .",
    "they found that carbon enrichment strongly correlated with helium enrichment , e.g. , with carbon enhancement of at least 1% up to 3% by mass for the he - rich stars ( see fig . 3 in moehler et al .",
    "moreover , latour et al .",
    "( 2014 ) obtained the spectra of 38 hot ehb stars ( @xmath5 @xmath44 30000 k ) in @xmath1 cen using the mxu mode of fors2/vlt and determined their fundamental parameters ( e.g. , effective temperature , gravity , surface abundance for hydrogen , helium and carbon ) .",
    "they clearly found that there is a positive correlation between carbon and helium enrichment for their he - rich ehb stars ( see fig . 7 in latour",
    "et al . 2014 ) , and the surface carbon mass fraction is up to about 1.5% for the most he - rich ehb stars .",
    "these observations are consistent with the results predicted by our late hot flash model in this study ( e.g. , in table 2 , the surface carbon for the late hot flash model is about 1.1% by mass , which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the value for normal flash and early hot flash model ) , and it seems to favor the late hot flash scenario for the formation of he - rich ehb stars in @xmath1 cen ( but also see the discussion in sect 4.2 of latour et al .",
    "2014 ) .    )",
    "- @xmath5 plane .",
    "the observation data is from moehler et al .",
    "( 2004).,width=321 ]    bhk stars have been so far found in a few most massive gcs .",
    "dieball et al . (",
    "2009 ) investigated the relationship between the physical or structural parameters of gcs and the presence of bhk stars .",
    "they found that the mass of gcs is the most important fact linked to the formation of bhk stars when comparing the gcs with and without bhk stars .",
    "a possible solution for this result is that more massive gcs host more binaries , and the binary interaction ( e.g. , tidally enhanced stellar wind ) may provide the huge mass loss on the rgb which is needed for the late hot flash scenario to form bhk stars . from table 1 of dieball",
    "et al . ( 2009 ) , the gcs hosting bhk stars also show long relaxation times , large core radii , small concentration and large escape velocities , which means these gcs are not core - collapsed .",
    "the most likely explanation is that a significant fraction of binaries exist in these gcs and decelerate or prevent the core collapse process .",
    "recently , low close binary fraction was found for ehb stars in gcs ( moni bidin et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 ) , which demonstrated a different formation channel between ehb stars and their counterparts in the field , subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars ( han et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 )",
    ". this result does not contradict with ours .",
    "one can see from table 2 in this study , the initial orbital periods of the binaries which can produce bhk stars or canonical ehb stars by tidally enhanced stellar wind are longer than 1000 d. moreover , the orbital periods of the binary become even longer during the binary evolution ( see panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "thus , it is difficult for these systems to be identified as binaries from observation .",
    "radial velocity ( rv ) survey is likely unable to find these binaries as well due to their long orbital periods , since the rv variations for these systems would be too small .",
    "however , some of these binaries may be detected by eclipses , though long campaigns would be required . in our models , the secondary is a ms star which is not too faint ( e.g. , 0.52@xmath21 for @xmath19 = 1.6 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the bhk primary star could be redder and more luminous than as a single hot hb star in the optical cmd of gcs .",
    "in fact , castellani et al . ( 2006 ) found some peculiar hb stars ( named hbp stars in their study ) which are cooler or redder than the typical hot hb stars in the optical cmd of ngc 2808 ( see fig . 2 in castellani et al .",
    "2006 ) , and they suggested that at least a fraction of these stars are a binary nature with the faint companions having not been detected . on the other hand , bedin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and iannicola et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found no distinct radial distribution differences for hb stars ( including ehb stars ) in ngc 2808 , which argues against the binary nature for these stars .",
    "since binary systems would be segregated into the core of the gc due to their massive masses , the bhk stars would be more central concentrated if they are formed through binaries .",
    "one roughly possible explanation for this contradiction is that the bhk primary stars may be diffused out the gc s core by exchange interactions during the evolution of the cluster . due to the high density in the core of gcs",
    ", there are short - lived three and four - body gravitational encounters where a star may be exchanged into an existing binary and displaces one of the components of that binary ( heggie 1975 ) . by doing n - body simulations for 100,000 stars in cluster , hurley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the primordial binaries can be replaced by new dynamical or exchange binaries through exchange interaction , and these exchange binaries even become a dominate population in the core of gc at the core - collapse phase ( see fig . 7 in their study ) .",
    "the tidal enhancement efficiency , @xmath14 , in this study is set to 10000 which is a typical value used by tout & eggleton ( 1988 ) , but a different value of @xmath14 will not influence much on the main results obtained in this study ( see the discussion in lei et al .",
    "since a smaller @xmath14 would cause enough mass loss on the rgb and produce bhk stars for a relative shorter period , while a bigger one also would produce bhk stars with a relative longer period .",
    "though a fixed value for the mass ratio of primary to secondary is used in this study ( e.g. , @xmath19 = 1.6 ) , as discussed in lei et al .",
    "( 2013a ) , we found limited effects for different values of @xmath19 on the mass loss of the primary star , and it just alters a little bit of the initial binary period which is needed to produce bhk stars . finally , it is worth mentioning that , though the parameters used in this study are suitable for gcs ( e.g. , age , metallicity ) , the scenario proposed here ( i.e. , the tidally enhanced stellar wind ) is also a possible explanation for the formation of hot subdwarf stars in the field , which has been previously suggested by han et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , but the detailed investigation for this field is out the scope of current study .",
    "in this paper , we suggested that tidally enhanced stellar wind in binary evolution may provide the huge mass loss on the rgb which is needed for the late hot flash scenario to explain the formation of bhk stars .",
    "the tidally enhanced stellar wind was added into detailed stellar evolution code , mesa , to investigate its contributions on the formation of bhk stars .",
    "four different initial orbital periods for binaries are adopted in the calculations , e.g. , @xmath22 = 2200 , 2000 , 1610 and 1600 days .",
    "we found that , if the initial orbital period are longer than @xmath22 = 2200 d , the primary stars would experience normal helium flash at the rgb tip and become canonical hb stars , e.g. , ehb , blue hb or red hb stars , while if the initial periods are shorter than @xmath22 = 2200 d but longer than @xmath22 = 2000 d , the primary stars would experience early hot flash and become canonical ehb stars . for 1600 d @xmath23 2000",
    "d , the primary stars undergo late hot flash when descending the white dwarf cooling curve and become bhk stars after helium core flash . however , if the initial orbital periods are shorter than @xmath22 = 1600 d , the primary stars would become helium white dwarfs due to too much mass loss on the rgb . our results are consistent with the observation in the cmd and the @xmath0 plane for ngc 2808 .",
    "however , the helium abundance of our models seems to be higher than the ones observed in bhk stars .",
    "it may be due to the fact that gravitational settling and radiative levitation are not considered in our models as well as the fact that flash mixing efficiency is overestimated in the calculation .",
    "the orbital periods for the binary systems that can produce bhk stars or canonical ehb stars by tidally enhanced stellar wind may be too long to make these systems identified as binaries in observation .",
    "our results suggested that tidally enhanced stellar wind in binary evolution is a possible and reasonable formation channel for bhk stars in gcs .",
