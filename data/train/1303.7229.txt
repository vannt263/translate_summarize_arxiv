    "the matter - laser interaction is an interesting topic in physics .",
    "many interesting new phenomena are waiting us to explore@xcite .",
    "theoretically , the problem is how to solve the wave equation of charged particles under the joint actions of the laser and of other origins .",
    "therefore , the easiest problem in this area is the electron - laser collision . to solve it",
    "one needs only to solve the wave equation of an electron in a classical electromagnetic field presenting the laser only . for a plane wave laser",
    "it is already solved@xcite .",
    "of course , even in a simple electron - laser collision , some photons other than those in the source laser may be created or absorbed .",
    "the fundamental theory for researching these processes has to be quantum electrodynamics .",
    "quantum electrodynamics is the most successful theory in physics@xcite .",
    "its results always agree with observations to a precision as high as achievable by the present experiments .",
    "this is because the smallness of the electromagnetic coupling constant and the renormalizability of the theory .",
    "main applications of quantum electrodynamics were to various processes participated by a few photons and electrons only . in these applications , it is called the quantum electrodynamics in vacuum . however , in the electron - laser processes , although the interaction is still of the electromagnetic origin but is not weak because the coherence of huge number photons interacting with the electron . to handle the non - perturbation character in these processes one needs some new methods in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "here we formulate a quantum electrodynamics in laser , in which the vacuum state of usual formulation is substituted by a coherent state of photons describing the laser . in the following we will show that , this formulation is a new picture of quantum electrodynamics , equivalent to its other pictures , but suitable for the treatment of electromagnetic processes with a laser . the interaction of electrons with the laser is exactly considered , but the interaction between electrons and the photons outside the laser is still handled by perturbation . the electron laser scattering is demonstrated as an example , with special interest in the possible construction of a @xmath1ray laser .",
    "in section [ a2 ] we reform the quantum electrodynamics , so that instead to quantize the electromagnetic field itself we quantize the fluctuation of it around one of its classical solutions , the laser field . as a contrast , the usual quantization method of electrodynamics in vacuum",
    "is also shortly reviewed . in section [ a3 ]",
    "we apply the obtained formulation to the case of quantum electrodynamics in a circularly polarized laser , and transform it into a picture , in which the hamiltonian is divided into two parts , one is time independent and another is a small perturbation . in section [ a4 ]",
    "we solve the eigen - equation of the time independent unperturbed hamiltonian , obtain a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions for the electron . by expanding the electron field in terms of this set of eigenfunctions ,",
    "we quantize the electron field in the laser .",
    "the formulation is completed . in section [ a5 ]",
    "we apply this formulation to the electron laser collision , the expression of the cross section is obtained , and some examples of numerical results are shown . in section [ a6 ]",
    "more numerical results are shown .",
    "especially , the case of large @xmath2 is discussed in some details .",
    "@xmath2 is an integer , may be imagined to be the number of photons in the laser , which participate the collision . but from an analysis of the mathematical derivation we see , its presence is a result of the electron wave distortion by the laser . in section [ a7 ]",
    "the possibility of making a @xmath0ray laser by the electron laser collision is considered .",

    "since @xmath19 is of the higher order of the small parameter @xmath20 , and is proportional to the square of electron number density , one needs to consider the first two terms only in eq.([4 ] ) for processes participated by a few electrons and photons , unless the electron number density in the problem is as high as that in atoms .",
