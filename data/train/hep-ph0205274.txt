    "the measured @xmath3-quark production cross section at hadron colliders exceeds next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd predictions by more than a factor of two .",
    "while it is conceivable that this discrepancy is due to higher - order corrections , the disagreement is surprising since nlo calculations have been reliable for other processes in this energy range .",
    "berger et al .  have analysed @xmath3-quark production in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and find that the excess in the cross section could be attributed to gluino pair - production followed by gluino decay into pairs of @xmath3 quarks and @xmath0 squarks , if both the gluino and the @xmath0 squark are sufficiently light @xcite .",
    "in order to reproduce the transverse - momentum distribution of the @xmath3 quarks , the masses of the gluino and light @xmath0-squark mass eigenstate should be in the range @xmath716gev and @xmath85.5gev .",
    "the masses of all other supersymmetric ( susy ) particles are assumed to be large , of order several hundred gev , so as to have evaded detection at lep2 .",
    "interestingly , a renormalization - group analysis in the framework of the unconstrained mssm shows that a light @xmath0 squark is most natural if it is accompanied by a light gluino with mass of order 10gev @xcite .",
    "berger et al .  have further observed that a light @xmath0 squark could have escaped direct detection .",
    "for example , the additional contribution to the @xmath9 cross section at large energy would only be about 2% and hence difficult to disentangle .",
    "the pair - production of light scalars would alter the angular distribution of hadronic jets in @xmath10 collisions , but the present data are not sufficiently precise to rule out the existence of this effect @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are important @xmath11-pole constraints on the parameters of this model .",
    "most importantly , production of the light @xmath0 squark at the @xmath11 pole has to be suppressed , which implies a stringent constraint on the mixing angle @xmath12 relating the sbottom mass and weak eigenstates @xcite .",
    "more recently , several authors have studied loop effects of the light susy particles on electroweak precision measurements @xcite , finding potentially large contributions to the quantity @xmath13 . however , a conflict with existing data can be avoided by having some of the superpartner masses near current experimental bounds , or by allowing for a new cp - violating phase in the susy sector @xcite .",
    "the null result of a cleo search for the semileptonic decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 of sbottom hadrons implies that the branching ratios for the decays @xmath16 induced by @xmath17-parity violating couplings , or @xmath18 with an ultra - light neutralino @xmath19 , must be highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "however , a light @xmath0 squark would be allowed to decay promptly via hadronic @xmath17-parity violating couplings in the modes @xmath20 or @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) .",
    "alternatively , it could be long - lived , forming @xmath0-hadrons",
    ". an interesting consequence of hadronic @xmath17-parity violating decays would be the abundant production of light baryons .",
    "this could significantly alter the thrust - axis angular distribution for continuum events containing baryons at the @xmath4 factories",
    ".    a striking manifestation of the light @xmath0-squark scenario would be the production of like - sign charged @xmath4 mesons at hadron colliders , because the majorana nature of the gluino allows for the production of @xmath23 and @xmath24 final states @xcite .",
    "another potential signature at hadron colliders is an enhanced yield of @xmath25 events @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that sbottom pairs would be copiously produced in @xmath26 and @xmath27 decays @xcite .",
    "precise measurements of bottomonium decays could lead to new constraints on the squark and gluino masses .",
    "the presence of light susy particles alters the running of @xmath28 , and it is often argued that this would exclude the existence of light gluinos .",
    "this argument is incorrect .",
    "first , a gluino with mass @xmath2gev would have a relatively small effect on the evolution of @xmath28 .",
    "taking , for instance , @xmath29 ( a value in agreement with all low - energy determinations of the qcd coupling ) and including the contribution of the gluino octet to the @xmath30 function above the scale @xmath31 yields @xmath32 , which is about three standard deviations higher than the canonical value @xmath33 .",
    "however , considering that at leading order only virtual gluino pairs contribute to the @xmath30 function , a more realistic treatment would include the gluino contribution above a scale @xmath34gev , in which case @xmath35 , in good agreement with the standard value .",
    "secondly , it is important to realize that even a value of @xmath36 significantly above 0.118 would not rule out the model , the reason being that the characteristic scale @xmath37 inherent in all determinations of @xmath38 is typically much smaller than the total energy .",
    "this is true , in particular , for the determinations based on event - shape variables . in practice ,",
    "the measurements fix @xmath38 somewhere between a fraction of the @xmath11 mass down to several gev , where the gluino contribution to the @xmath30 function is negligible . using these determinations to quote values of @xmath36 ( as is routinely done )",
    "assumes implicitly that the coupling runs as predicted in the sm . finally ,",
    "a careful analysis of the running of @xmath28 in the presence of light susy particles would have to include , for each observable , the modifications in the theoretical formulae due to virtual and real emissions of the new particles .",
    "these corrections could be significant , and could partially compensate effects arising from the modification of the @xmath30 function .",
    "if we are to take the possibility of a light @xmath0 squark and light gluinos seriously , then the theoretical study of their impact must be extended to the phenomenology of weak decays of the @xmath3 quark .",
    "new sources of flavor violation arise from @xmath39-@xmath0-@xmath40 and @xmath41-@xmath0-@xmath40 couplings .",
    "the overall scale of susy flavor - changing interactions originating from gluino exchange is set by the factor @xmath42 , which is much larger than the corresponding factor @xmath43 for weak decays in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "consequently , the new flavor - changing couplings must be much smaller than the ckm mixing angles in order for this model to be phenomenologically viable .",
    "the most stringent bounds arise from the radiative decay @xmath5 , which we discuss in the present work .",
    "( contributions of light @xmath0 squarks to kaon decays , @xmath44-@xmath45 mixing , and @xmath46-@xmath47 mixing are strongly suppressed . )",
    "the presence of such tight bounds implies stringent constraints on model building .",
    "if the light @xmath0 squark is sufficiently light to be pair - produced in @xmath3 decays , new unconventional decay channels would be opened up , which could affect the phenomenology of @xmath4 mesons and beauty baryons .",
    "examples of potentially interesting consequences include modifications of beauty lifetime ratios , an enhancement of the semileptonic branching ratio of @xmath4 mesons via production of charmless final states containing @xmath0 squarks , an enhancement of @xmath48 and of the semileptonic cp asymmetry @xmath49 , and wrong - sign kaon production via @xmath50 transitions allowed by the majorana nature of the gluino .",
    "the phenomenology of such effects will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "if the light @xmath0 squark is too heavy to be pair - produced , it would still give rise to potentially large virtual effects in @xmath4 decays .",
    "their study is the main purpose of this letter .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 with @xmath53 the down - squark mass eigenstates , and by @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 the interaction eigenstates ( the superpartners of the left - handed and right - handed down quarks ) .",
    "they are related by a unitary transformation @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we identify @xmath59 with the light sbottom mass eigenstate and define a sbottom - sector mixing angle @xmath12 through @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the fact that the light @xmath0 squarks are not produced in @xmath11 decays implies @xmath62 the phenomenologically favored range for the @xmath63 coupling is @xmath640.45 @xcite , meaning that the light sbottom is predominantly the superpartner of the right - handed bottom quark . in our numerical analysis",
    "we will assume a vanishing tree - level coupling to the @xmath11 and thus use @xmath65 .",
    "the flavor - changing couplings involving the light @xmath0 and @xmath40 fields can be parameterized by dimensionless quantities @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 or @xmath41 for @xmath69 or @xmath70 transitions , respectively . in general the parameters @xmath71",
    "are complex , which can lead to new cp - violating effects .",
    "these parameters are invariant under a phase redefinition of the light @xmath0-squark state , and they transform in the same way as the products @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 ) of ckm matrix elements under a phase redefinition of the down - type quark fields .",
    "it follows that ratios of the type @xmath74 and @xmath75 are invariant under phase redefinitions , and thus can carry an observable , cp - violating phase .",
    "flavor - changing hadronic processes in the model with a light gluino and a very light @xmath0 squark are most transparently described by means of an effective `` weak '' hamiltonian .",
    "if we neglect effects that are suppressed by inverse powers of the heavy susy scale , the relevant energy scales are the electroweak scale , at which the usual sm flavor - changing operators are generated by integrating out the top quark and the @xmath76 and @xmath11 bosons , and the scale @xmath77 , at which new flavor - changing operators are generated by integrating out the gluinos .",
    "we start by discussing the construction of the effective theory below the gluino scale , focusing on the new interactions proportional to @xmath71 induced by gluino exchange , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : effth ] .",
    "susy modifications of the renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution of the standard weak - interaction operators will be discussed later .",
    "the remaining light degrees of freedom in the low - energy theory are the quarks @xmath78 , the photon and gluons , and the light @xmath0 squark .",
    "operators in the effective hamiltonian can be organized in an expansion in inverse powers of the gluino mass . for @xmath79 , it is a good approximation to keep the leading terms in this expansion , which have mass dimension five .",
    "these operators comprise the usual electromagnetic and chromomagnetic dipole operators , and new operators containing two scalar @xmath0 fields .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath69 transitions is ( here and below , @xmath80 denotes the running gluino mass at the gluino matching scale ) @xmath81 + o(1/{m_{\\tilde g}}^2 ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 we work with the covariant derivative @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the electric charge of a down - type ( s)quark .",
    "( to facilitate comparison with the literature , which usually adopts the opposite sign convention for the couplings , we have included a factor of @xmath85 in the definition of the dipole operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 . ) in addition , there are dimension - five fermion - number violating interactions of the form @xmath88 , which mediate @xmath50 transitions .",
    "they are irrelevant to our discussion here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     it is well known that nlo corrections have a significant impact on the @xmath5 decay rate in the sm , which is largely due to nlo corrections to the matrix elements of the operators @xmath89 in the effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "( nlo corrections to the wilson coefficient @xmath90 have a much smaller effect . ) in order to capture the bulk of these corrections , we include the @xmath91 contributions to the matrix elements but neglect susy nlo corrections to the coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we also neglect two - loop contributions to the matrix elements involving @xmath0-squark loops .",
    "this is justified because of the relatively large mass of the @xmath0 squark , and because our two - loop anomalous dimension calculation has shown that there is very little mixing of the squark operators into the dipole operators . at nlo",
    "our results become sensitive to the precise definition of the mass parameter @xmath94 , which we identify with the so - called upsilon mass @xcite , for which we take the value @xmath95gev @xcite .",
    "( up to a small nonperturbative contribution , @xmath96 is one half of the mass of the @xmath97 resonance . )",
    "we also introduce a cutoff @xmath98 on the photon energy in the @xmath4-meson rest frame , which is required in the experimental analysis of radiative @xmath4 decays .",
    "we then obtain @xmath99 where @xmath100 is obtained from the formulae in @xcite by obvious modifications to include the effects of the new susy contributions , and by a change in some of the nlo terms due to the introduction of the upsilon mass in ( [ rate ] ) @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the branching ratio on the susy flavor - changing couplings can be made explicit by writing @xmath101 \\,.\\ ] ] in table  [ tab : rcoeff ] , we give results for the coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath103 including the dominant theoretical uncertainties .",
    "following @xcite , we use a running charm - quark mass in the penguin - loop diagrams rather than the pole mass .",
    "this is justified , because the photon - energy cut imposed in the experimental analysis prevents the intermediate charm - quark propagators from being near their mass shell . specifically , we work with the mass ratio @xmath104 , where the running masses are obtained from @xmath105gev and @xmath106gev .        in the left - hand plot in figure",
    "[ fig : bsgamma ] , we confront our theoretical result for the @xmath5 branching ratio with the cleo measurement @xmath107 obtained for @xmath108 gev @xcite .",
    "( this result actually corresponds to the sum of @xmath5 and @xmath109 decays .",
    "however , the suppression of the exclusive @xmath110 decay with respect to the @xmath111 mode implies that the dominant contribution to the inclusive decay must come from @xmath112 transitions . in the context of our model",
    ", it follows that the couplings @xmath113 must obey even tighter constraints than the @xmath114 . )",
    "it follows that the maximum allowed values of the parameters @xmath114 are @xmath115 , as is already obvious from the magnitude of the coefficients @xmath103 in table  [ tab : rcoeff ] .",
    "however , values larger than @xmath116 would require a fine - tuning of the phase of @xmath117 and are thus somewhat unnatural . note that the ratio shown on the vertical axis in the plot is bound to lie between 1 and @xmath85 , and in the limit @xmath118 corresponds to @xmath119 , where @xmath120 denotes the cp - violating phase of @xmath117 .",
    "the right - hand plot in the figure shows a similar constraint arising from the inclusive charmless decay @xmath6 . at leading order",
    ", the decay rate for this process is obtained from ( [ rate ] ) by the replacements @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the allowed region corresponds to the cleo upper bound of 8.2% ( at 95% c.l . ) for the @xmath6 branching ratio @xcite .",
    "there are , however , potentially large theoretical uncertainties in this result , because we neglect nlo corrections to the branching ratio .",
    "we therefore refrain from combining the two plots to reduce the allowed parameter space .    in the sm",
    ", the direct cp asymmetry in the inclusive decay @xmath5 is very small , below 1% in magnitude @xcite . in the susy scenario , on the other hand",
    ", the phase of the coupling @xmath117 could lead to a large asymmetry . in the approximation where one neglects the susy contributions to the cp - averaged decay rate in ( [ rate ] ) , which is justified in view of the good agreement of the sm prediction with the data , the formulae in @xcite",
    "yield the prediction @xmath123 , where we have neglected the small contribution from the charm - quark loops and the yet smaller contribution from @xmath0-squark loops .",
    "( we use the standard phase convention where @xmath124 is real . in general , the cp asymmetry depends on @xmath125 . )",
    "it follows that even within the very restrictive bounds shown in figure  [ fig : bsgamma ] there can be a potentially large contribution to the cp asymmetry , which would provide a striking manifestation of physics beyond the sm .",
    "in fact , the cleo bounds @xmath126 ( at 90% c.l . ) @xcite imply that @xmath127 placing another tight constraint on the flavor - changing coupling @xmath117 .",
    "new supersymmetric contributions to @xmath3-quark production at hadron colliders can account for the long - standing discrepancy between the measured cross sections and qcd predictions if there is a light @xmath0 squark with mass in the range 25.5gev , accompanied by a somewhat heavier gluino @xcite . in this letter , we have explored the phenomenology of rare @xmath4 decays in such a scenario and have found tight bounds on the flavor - changing parameters controlling supersymmetric contributions to @xmath69 and @xmath70 fcnc transitions .",
    "the most restrictive constraints arise from virtual effects of light @xmath0 squarks in @xmath5 decays .",
    "we have analysed this process by constructing a low - energy effective hamiltonian , in which the gluinos are integrated out , while the @xmath0 squarks remain as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "we find that the flavor - changing couplings @xmath128 and @xmath117 must be of order few times @xmath129 or less .",
    "( even tighter constraints hold for the analogous @xmath70 couplings . )",
    "this implies that certain off - diagonal entries of the down - squark mass matrix must be suppressed by a similar factor compared to the generic squark - mass squared .",
    "even with such tight constraints on the couplings , this model allows for interesting and novel new physics effects in weak decays of @xmath4 mesons and beauty baryons . as an example",
    ", we have discussed the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath5 decays , which could be enhanced with respect to its standard model value by an order of magnitude .",
    "other possible effects include an enhanced @xmath6 decay rate .",
    "we have not considered here the possibility of @xmath0-squark pair - production , which would be kinematically allowed for very light squark masses .",
    "the new decay modes @xmath130 and @xmath50 would affect the decay widths of @xmath4 mesons and @xmath131 baryons differently , and hence might explain the anomaly of the low @xmath131 lifetime . we will report on this interesting possibility elsewhere .    s.b .  and m.n .",
