    "their identification as a host of fractional spin excitations and topological order  @xcite , and the seminal works of anderson  @xcite highlighting the possible connection of the `` resonating valence - bond '' scenario to high-@xmath4 has established the study of spin liquids as one of the most active areas of research .",
    "the traditional recipe for obtaining spin liquids involves the task of melting magnetic long - range order by either geometrical or parametrical frustration in a quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "recently , the synthesis of a growing number of quantum magnets with competing antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) interactions , has also fuelled the search for paramagnets in an fm environment  @xcite .",
    "while frustration from the interplay between af and fm couplings can be similarly efficient in melting magnetic order as in the purely af case , the propensity for resonating singlet bonds is weakened in favor of resonating _ triplet _ bonds .",
    "the latter scenario opens up the possibility of stabilizing an exotic variant of a quantum paramagnet , called a _",

    "while a spin nematic is characterized by an absence of dipolar magnetic order , i.e. , @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 denotes the spin operator at site @xmath7 ) , and respects time - reversal symmetry , it breaks @xmath8 spin - rotation symmetry due to a non - zero quadrupolar order parameter of the form @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "it can be viewed as a quantum spin analog of the nematic state in liquid crystals where the spin direction takes the role of the orientation of molecules .",
    "historically , the search has focussed on @xmath12 heisenberg systems with additional biquadratic [ @xmath13 interactions  @xcite , and more recently on systems in a magnetic field  @xcite . on the experimental front ,",
    "the detection of quadrupolar order is extremely challenging , e.g. , in thermodynamic measurements their response is widely indistinguishable from that of antiferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "however , techniques such as neutron scattering in a magnetic field have been suggested as probes to detect nematic order  @xcite .",
    "only very recently has the possible existence of nematic orders been reported in iron - based high-@xmath4 superconductors such as fese  @xcite , in the mineral linarite  @xcite , and in ultra - cold atomic gases  @xcite ( see ref .   for further details on candidate materials ) .        in this article",

    "the close relation between ln states and coplanar spiral phases has already been realized in other frustrated spin models  @xcite , and is attributed to the fact that both states break the fourfold lattice - rotation symmetry .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath106 hm state is the only type of classical ground state in this model where the ordering wave vector does not have at least one vanishing component , indicating that fm correlations due to @xmath137 are less important for the formation of this phase .",

    "<S> we investigate the quantum phases of the frustrated spin-@xmath0 @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 heisenberg model on the square lattice with ferromagnetic @xmath1 and antiferromagnetic @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions . using the pseudo - fermion functional renormalization group technique </S>",
    "<S> , we find an intermediate paramagnetic phase located between classically ordered ferromagnetic , stripy antiferromagnetic , and incommensurate spiral phases . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that quantum fluctuations lead to significant shifts of the spiral pitch angles compared to the classical limit . by computing the response of the system with respect to various spin rotation and lattice symmetry - breaking perturbations , </S>",
    "<S> we identify a complex interplay between different nematic spin states in the paramagnetic phase . while retaining time - reversal invariance , these phases either break spin - rotation symmetry , lattice - rotation symmetry , or a combination of both . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 heisenberg model on the square lattice as a paradigmatic example where different intimately connected types of nematicities emerge in the same model . </S>"
