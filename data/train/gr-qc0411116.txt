    "french - italian collaboration virgo  @xcite has built a large - scale interferometric gravitational - wave  detector near pisa , italy .",
    "the main instrument is a michelson interferometer ( mi ) with 3 km long fabry - perot  ( fp ) cavities in its arms .",
    "high - quality optics are suspended to act as quasi - free test masses at the end of the michelson interferometer  arms so that a gravitational wave , passing perpendicular to the detector , will be detected in the interferometer signal .",
    "the fabry - perot  cavities in the arms enhance the light power and thus increase the optical gain of the interferometer .",
    "the apparatus is designed to achieve a relative displacement sensitivity of better than @xmath0 between 20hz and 10khz .",
    "the sensitivity will be limited by seismic disturbances below 3hz , by thermal noise up to 100hz and by shot noise for higher frequencies .    in order to reach this extreme sensitivity ,",
    "the virgodetector uses special techniques to minimise the coupling of noise into the interferometric signal .",
    "the large optics ( mirrors and beam splitters ) are super - polished fused silica pieces with very low absorption and scattering .",
    "they are located in an ultra - high vacuum system and suspended from a sophisticated seismic isolation system , the so - called superattenuator  @xcite .",
    "the superattenuator  consists of a multistage pendulum and offers an enormous passive isolation from seismic motion for fourier frequencies larger than its mechanical resonance frequencies ( @xmath1 at 10hz ) .",
    "however , the motion at the resonance frequencies ( between 10mhz and 4hz ) can be large and must be reduced by active control .",
    "the optics of the michelson interferometer  and of the cavities have to be well - aligned with respect to each other and with respect to the incoming beam to reach their high optical qualities .",
    "the angular degrees of freedom of the suspended optics show a non - negligible deviations which , if uncontrolled , distort the cavity eigen - modes and also the interference at the beam splitter .",
    "this causes power modulation of the light fields ; long term drifts will make a longitudinal control impossible after a certain amount time ; and furthermore , mis - alignments increase the coupling of other noise sources into the main detector output . to guarantee a stable long - term operation and a high sensitivity the angular degrees of freedom have to be actively controlled .",
    "figure  [ fig : optical - layout ] shows a simplified optical layout of the virgo interferometer in the recombined configuration . although the mi in the recombined configuration does not provide a detector sensitive enough for detecting gravitational waves , it is the final step on the way to the detector with recycling .",
    "it allows to characterise the optical signals to implement the proper control system for the recycled interferometer , for example , for the frequency stabilisation or the automatic alignment .",
    "the laser light , 20w @1064 nm provided by an injection - locked master - slave solid state laser ( nd : yag ) , enters the vacuum system at the _ injection bench _ ( ib ) .",
    "the beam is spatially filtered by a 144 m long input mode - cleaner  cavity ( imc ) before being injected into the main interferometer .",
    "the laser frequency is pre - stabilised using the imc cavity as a reference .",
    "the low - frequency stability is achieved by an additional control system that stabilises the imc length below 15hz to the length of a so - called reference cavity ( rfc ) .",
    "a beam with 10w of power enters the michelson interferometer through the power - recycling mirror . in the recombined configuration the power - recycling mirror  is largely misaligned so that it merely attenuates the beam without interacting with the rest of the interferometer . in consequence , a beam with approximately 800mw is impinging on the main beam splitter .",
    "it is split into two beams that are injected into the 3 km long arm cavities .",
    "the finesse of the arm cavities is approximately 50 ; this yields a circulating light power of 13w .",
    "the flat input mirrors and the spherical end mirrors form a stable resonator with the beam waist being at the input mirrors with a radius of approximately 20 mm .",
    "the mi is held on the dark fringe , and the expected gravitational wavesignal will be measured in the beam from the dark port , which is passed through an _ output mode cleaner _ ( omc ) , a 2.5 cm long rigid cavity and then detected on photo diode  b1 ( in fact , b1 is a group of 16 ingaas photo diodes ) .",
    "the interferometer control systems utilise the interferometer output signals and a modulation - demodulation method . for this purpose",
    "the laser beam is modulated in phase with a electro - optic modulator ( eom , see figure  [ fig : optical - layout ] ) at @xmath2mhz .",
    "such a phase modulation generates new frequency components with a frequency offset of @xmath3 to the frequency of the laser beam @xmath4 .",
    "these frequency components are called _ sidebands _ , and the light field at @xmath4 is called _ carrier _    the photo currents detected by the photo diodes in several output ports of the interferometer are then demodulated with the same frequency @xmath5 or multiples of that frequency . the demodulated signals from single element diodes ( b1 to b8 ) are used for the length control of the interferometer , whereas the demodulated signals from split photo detectors ( q21 to q82 ) provide control signals for the angular degrees of freedom of the interferometer mirrors .",
    "the modulation - demodulation technique is commonly used in many interferometers , especially in the other interferometric gravitational wave detectors ( ligo , tama and geo600  @xcite ) . however , for each interferometer a unique control topology has been developed , depending on the details of the experimental realisation of the optical system  @xcite .",
    "the automatic alignment of the interferometer consists of two types of control : the _ linear alignment _ measures the mirror positions with respect to the laser beam and feeds back to the mirrors angular positions ( bandwidth @xmath6hz ) , and the _ drift control _ : a low frequency ( bandwidth @xmath7mhz ) control measures the beam axis position in the two interferometer arms and feeds back to the beam splitter  and the injection bench angular position .",
    "the specifications given for the alignment control require that the angular fluctuations are reduced to @xmath8 for the recycling mirror , @xmath9 for the cavity input mirrors and @xmath10 for the cavity end mirrors .    during the lock acquisition process the mirrors and the beam splitterare controlled by local control systems that keep the mirrors aligned with respect to local references@xcite .",
    "these controls can reduce the angular fluctuations of the mirrors to a few microradians rms over a time period of one hour .",
    "but the local control can neither achieve the required long term stability nor the low noise spectral density .",
    "the purpose of the linear alignment is to provide a global control for the mirror alignment that uses the most precise error signals derived from the interferometer itself .",
    "thus , after the interferometer has reached its operating condition , the controls of the angular positions should be switched from the local controls to the linear alignment .",
    "the control topology for the linear alignment of virgo has been designed and tested using time domain simulations and a table - top prototype experiment@xcite .",
    "the control system for the virgointerferometer is unique in two ways : first , only one modulation is used to derive control signals for all longitudinal and angular degrees of freedom of the main interferometer .",
    "second , as the only large - scale interferometer virgomakes use of the anderson technique  @xcite in the sense that it uses the light transmitted by the arm cavities to generate differential wave - front signals .",
    "this design requires a carefully chosen modulation frequency and carefully tuned cavity lengths .",
    "the respective cavities are : the input mode cleaner  cavity of @xmath11 m , the arm cavities with @xmath12 km and the short power - recycling cavity  formed by pr with ni and wi with a length of @xmath13 m .",
    "the sideband frequency and the cavity lengths have to be set following an exact scheme :    * in order to pass the sidebands through the imc the modulation frequency must be an exact multiple of the imc s free spectral range : @xmath14 with n as an integral number .",
    "this condition has to be tuned very carefully because a mismatch of only a few hz couples lengths noise of the imc into the main interferometer signals .",
    "* for the longitudinal control signals the sidebands should be anti - resonant in the arm cavities and resonant in power - recycling cavity .",
    "this can be achieved if the sideband frequency is a ) not an exact multiple of the arm cavities free spectral range  and b ) the sideband frequency is chosen such that @xmath15 .",
    "an accurate tuning of this condition is desirable to achieve an intrinsic decoupling of the longitudinal control signals but a deviation of a few khz can be tolerated .",
    "note that in the recombined configuration the power - recycling cavity  is not present so that this condition can be ignored . *",
    "the anderson technique requires the modulation frequency to be a resonance frequency of the @xmath16 mode in the arm cavities .",
    "thus : @xmath17 with n as a integral number , @xmath18 the free spectral range  of the arm cavity and @xmath19 the mode separation frequency , which is the difference between the resonance frequencies of tem modes for different mode numbers : @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the resonance frequency of a @xmath22 mode , @xmath23 , the speed of light and @xmath24 the radius of curvature of the cavity end mirror .",
    "+ the modulation frequency must be tuned with respect to this value given by the cavity length and the mirror curvature .",
    "the tolerance is @xmath25hz , given by the linewidth of the arm cavities .",
    "the sensors for the alignment control are _ quadrant split photo detectors _ ( or _ quadrant diodes _ for short ) .",
    "these are photo diodes with 4 separate elements , so called quadrants .",
    "the quadrants have an active area of 25@xmath26 each and are oriented at @xmath27 .",
    "the four quadrants ( up , down , left , right ) are separated by a 125micrometers wide gap and form together a circular photo sensitive area .",
    "each quadrant diode can provide a multitude of signals : the sum over four quadrants gives the same signal as a normal photo diode . in order to generate alignment control signals",
    "the differences between the upper and lower elements and the left and right elements are computed .",
    "these signals give the vertical and horizontal positions of the beam on the diode and serve as error signals for the drift control .",
    "a demodulation of a differential quadrant output at @xmath5 yield two additional outputs : the in - phase and quadrature signal contain information about the angle and position ( vertical and horizontal respectively ) of the phase front of the carrier with respect to the sidebands .",
    "these signals can provide very accurate error signal for an automatic alignment system if the optical setup is composed in such a way that a misalignment of a mirror produces a spatial separation between the carrier and the sidebands .",
    "this method is called differential wave - front sensing and is used to obtain error signals for the linear alignment control . for a single fabry - perot  cavity the alignment control signals can be derived in reflection of the cavity ( ward method @xcite ) or in transmission of the cavity ( anderson method @xcite ) . the automatic alignment system in virgouses also the light transmitted by the arm cavities and can thus be considered as an extension of the anderson technique : the quadrant diodes are arranged in pairs .",
    "four sets of two quadrants each are located in four of the interferometer outputs ( see figure  [ fig : optical - layout ] ) : in reflection ( q21 , q22 ) , at the reflection of the anti - reflex coated surface of the beam splitter  ( q51 , q52 ) and in transmission of the arm cavities ( q71 , q72 , q81 , q82 ) . adjustable lens telescopes are used so that the beam impinging on the two quadrants of each pair has a gouy phase difference of @xmath28 .",
    "the linear alignment of the virgointerferometer controls ten degrees of freedom : the angular positions of the four arm cavity mirrors ( ni , ne , wi and we ) plus the angular position of the pr mirror .    in the recombined configuration the two arm cavities",
    "are completely decoupled and can be treated as completely separated . in the case of final virgoconfiguration",
    "this is not longer the case ; all 10 degrees of freedom are strongly coupled",
    ".    in general , a demodulated signal of a quadrant detector represents a linear combination of the various angular degrees of freedom of the optical system . in order to design control systems of a complex system like the virgointerferometer it is important to reduce the coupling between the various degrees of freedom in the sensors .    in the following",
    "we assume that the cavity mirrors and the optical readout have been set up well , so that the horizontal and vertical degrees of freedom can be treated completely separately .",
    "a further separation of the several degrees of freedom in one quadrant diode signal can be achieved by tuning the gouy phase @xmath29 . for",
    "a simple fabry - perot  cavity with one plane and one curved mirror one can use one quadrant diode in near field ( @xmath30 ) to measure the alignment of the flat mirror and one quadrant in the far field ( @xmath31 ) to measure the curved mirror misalignment .",
    "the optimum gouy phases for the virgointerferometer have been computed using a interferometer simulation .",
    "adjustable telescopes are used to set the gouy phases to these values and to allow a further adjustment to correct for the unavoidable discrepancies between the experimental realisation and the simulation .",
    "finally the demodulation phase for each quadrant diode can be set in order to minimise the coupling of error signals .",
    "when the interferometer is at its operating point the dependence of the quadrant signals on the mirror positions can be described by a static matrix .",
    "for example , if we only consider the vertical alignment of north arm cavity mirrors ni and ne the signals on the quadrant diode q71 and q72 are given as @xmath32 with @xmath33 representing the in - phase component of the demodulated signal , @xmath34 the quadrature component , @xmath35 and @xmath36 the misalignment angles of the cavity mirrors and @xmath37 the so - called sensing matrix .",
    "the matrix coefficients depend on the demodulation phase and on the gouy phase of the beam on the detector .",
    "electronic phase shifters allow to control the demodulation phases such that the coupling of the various degrees is reduced .",
    "figure  [ fig : q71tx ] shows the measured and simulated matrix coefficient amplitudes for q71 as a function of the demodulation phase .",
    "the demodulated signal from all quadrant diodes are acquired as a digital signal , sampled at 500hz .",
    "a dedicated processor computes the misalignment angles with a linear reconstruction method using the measured sensing matrix .",
    "this is part of the _ global control _ , a combination of hardware and software which is used to compute corrections signals from photo diode error signals @xcite .",
    "the global control sends the alignment signals to digital signal processors ( dsp ) controlling the suspensions@xcite .",
    "the dsps apply the necessary control filters to compensate the mechanical transfer function of the suspended mirror and send the correction signals to the actuators of the suspension .",
    "the commissioning of the full virgodetector was started in september 2003 with the alignment of the imc output beam through the 3 km long arms .",
    "step by step , the interferometer length control systems have been implemented . in the meantime , the automatic alignment of the mirrors of the north arm had been implemented . in january 2004 , the automatic alignment control",
    "could be started for the first time on one of the long cavities .",
    "after the length control of the two arm cavities had been implemented , the interferometer was used in the so - called recombined configuration , in which also the position of the beam splitter  is controlled so that the outgoing beams interfere destructively ( output port b1 ) .",
    "this operating condition is called _",
    "dark fringe_. it turned out that the longitudinal control is very sensitive to mis - alignments of the mirrors .",
    "a reliable lock acquisition of the recombined interferometer required the linear alignment being engaged for the arm cavities .",
    "approximately every two months a short period of continuous data taking , a so - called _ commissioning run _ , has been scheduled .",
    "the data recorded during these runs are used to monitor the progress of the commissioning of the instrument and allow to evaluate the performance of the subsystems and control systems .",
    "so far , four such runs ( c1 to c4 ) have been performed .    during the c2",
    "run the automatic alignment of the north arm cavity was used for the first time in a data taking period .",
    "the presence of the alignment control reduces the power fluctuations in the cavity considerably and allows long continuous operation without manual re - alignment of the optics , see figure  [ fig : prb7dc ] .",
    "period of continuous operation of up to 32hours prove the reliability of the system with the alignment control .    in the following",
    "commissioning runs the performance of the system was further improved .",
    "the alignment control systems can be used without change with one single cavity or within the recombined configuration .",
    "it allows to reduce the rms alignment fluctuations of the mirrors can be reduced to less than @xmath38 microradian , see figure  [ fig : netx ] . below the unity gain frequency ( between 3hz and 5hz )",
    "the mirror motion is reduced by the control loop . for larger fourier frequencies a slight suppression of the alignment in - loop signal",
    "can be observed because the lower rms misalignment reduces the coupling of noise into the alignment signal .",
    "the system has proved to be easy to use and robust : the automatic mirror alignment is now part of the standard working condition of the virgointerferometer .",
    "the switching of the control authority from local controls to linear alignment can be preformed without losing the longitudinal control .",
    "the control system is designed to be limited by shot noise at a level of @xmath39radians@xmath40 . since the light power in the recombined configuration is about 500 times lower than in the final configuration the shot - noise limit",
    "could not yet be achieved .",
    "the sensitivity of the interferometer is currently too low to be spoiled by excess noise from the alignment control loops .",
    "the linear alignment error signals could be used to identify resonances of the mirror suspension system which showed a larger amplitude than expected .",
    "however , in the frequency range between @xmath41mhz and 10hz the alignment error signals as shown in figure  [ fig : netx ] are coherent with control signal of the input mode cleaner .",
    "it is likely that the performance today is limited by the beam jitter .",
    "further experiments are currently carried out to investigate the performance of the input beam control system .",
    "the virgointerferometer has been operated for several month in the recombined configuration , in which the power - recycling cavity  is not yet used .",
    "this configuration is not sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves but it allowed to implement and test the various subsystems of the detector . during this commissioning work",
    "we have successfully implemented for the first time an automatic mirror alignment system for a large - scale interferometer using the anderson technique . at the same time this demonstrates also for the first time the automatic alignment control of a 3 km long fabry - perot  with its mirrors suspended by complex superattenuator .    the delicate optical configuration which is necessary for the anderson technique has been set up correctly .",
    "the switching between the local control systems of the superattenuator  and the alignment control works well . a good long - term stability and noise performance of the control loops has been demonstrated .",
    "thus the control design for the linear alignment of the full detector has been validated .",
    "currently the implementation of the full automatic alignment system including the power - recycling mirror  is under way .",
