    "this would be a dubious result , since it would not be clear , which amplitude is correct . in our opinion ,",
    "absence of a transparent proof of eq.([w0 ] ) @xcite for the nucleons with the electroweak structure makes the whole haberzettl s calculation doubtful .",
    "let us note that such a proof can be done only if this structure is introduced not phenomenologically , but at a microscopic level .",
    "this is achieved here within the concept of the hidden local symmetry and respecting the local chiral @xmath44 invariance .",
    "moreover , it is not true that the right hand side of eq.(19 ) @xcite depends on @xmath1 only via @xmath14 , as stated in the paragraph after eq.(21 ) . in other words , fulfilling eq.([w0 ] ) does not mean the elimination of the dependence of the pion electroproduction amplitude on @xmath1 .",
    "the point is that it is the dynamical content of the model , which dictates the form factor of the kroll  ruderman term . as we have seen in our study ,",
    "if the model respects the local chiral symmetry , then this form factor is @xmath20 in the soft pion limit , as it should be , in order to be in accord with the current algebra and pcac .",
    "actually , this result should be valid for any model possessing the local chiral symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , models , respecting the gauge invariance only , will provide the kroll - ruderman term retaining the form factor @xmath21 .",
    "so the claim @xcite that the pion electroproduction processes at threshold can not be used to extract any information regarding the nucleon weak axial form factor should be considered as precipitous .    on the contrary , the measurement of the nucleon weak axial form factor @xmath20 in the electroproduction of charged pions on the proton at threshold makes a good sense . in the recent measurement @xcite of this form factor by the @xmath45 reaction , the pion electroproduction amplitude eq.([sppa ] ) with the added @xmath46 excitation terms",
    "was used to analyse the data .",
    "the value @xmath47 was found for the axial mass entering @xmath20 , which is consistent with the value of @xmath48 known from neutrino scattering experiments .",
    "let us note that the study of the electroproduction of charged pions on the proton at threshold can also provide the information on the pion charge radius @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
