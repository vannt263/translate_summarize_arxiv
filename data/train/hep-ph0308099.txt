    "a standard approximation @xcite is to describe the mesons by harmonic oscillator wavefunctions with a single @xmath72 value for all states . if we do this and fit to the experimental @xmath73 ratio we find @xmath74gev , which is considerably larger than @xmath75gev in `` ip '' but is in good agreement with @xmath76 in @xcite",
    ".    that the effective @xmath72 is larger than our `` ip '' value may be due to our pointlike pion approximation .",
    "experimentally the pion is not pointlike , it has a charge radius comparable with other light mesons and our radial wavefunction overlap should really take some account of this .",
    "quite possibly we are feeling this in the increased @xmath72 , which has subsumed the effect of the pion wavefunction .",
    "however it is worth noting that the effective @xmath72 values ( presented in @xcite ) for the meson wavefunctions computed in the model of godfrey and isgur@xcite are much larger than for the `` ip '' hamiltonian , and much closer to the @xmath77 gev preferred above .",

    "@xmath88 for the @xmath89 states we have , @xmath90 it is trivial to check that the expressions we have derived explicitly satisfy these rules .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the predictions of close and page@xcite satisfy these rules , as do the predictions of an alternative flux - tube breaking model@xcite ( which has different quantum numbers at the breaking point ) .",
    "these `` sum - rules '' appear to be a rather general property depending only upon the spin - orbit coupling structure of the states , consequently we expect them to be good if the flux - tube model is a good description of hybrid meson structure .",
    "their practical use is that once we have a candidate in @xmath91 we can estimate the partial widths of other hybrid states - even the non - exotic ones - in a relatively model - independent way .",
    "for example if the @xmath8 is a hybrid , then @xmath92 must also be prominent .",
    "for the conventional hadrons , the widths into @xmath78 may be used to give estimates for the widths into @xmath14 by converting the @xmath93 as in vector dominance .",
    "the basic premise is that the photon has some hadronic character - it can fluctuate into an off - shell vector meson with some amplitude and interact strongly with the hadron target .",
    "our phenomenological treatment will follow that of babcock & rosner@xcite .",
    "we find satisfactory agreement with experiment in the conventional sector for the radiative decays of the @xmath94@xcite , which motivates our application of the method to hybrid states .    for the exotic hybrid candidate @xmath8 , using the @xmath46 partial width prediction of 57 mev we find a @xmath95 partial width of @xmath96 kev .",
    "this is a healthy width , comparable to the conventional @xmath97 width of @xmath98 kev .",
    "the expectation of the flux - tube breaking model supplemented with vmd is of a maximum width of @xmath99 kev with a more realistic prediction of @xmath100 of this@xcite .",
    "the non - exotic @xmath101 hybrid , according to the `` sum rules '' of the previous section will have a partial width equal to this with modification only for the potentially different state mass .",
    "the exotic @xmath102 , if it has a mass @xmath103 mev has @xmath95 width @xmath104 kev . much of the suppression relative to the @xmath105 width is down to the factor of @xmath106 caused by @xmath107 .",
    "this does not appear for the isosinglet @xmath108 hybrid and there we expect @xmath109 .",
    "the axial hybrid @xmath110 was predicted to have a potentially very large @xmath46 width which was rather sensitive to wavefunction parameterisation .",
    "this large width unsurprisingly leads in vmd to a large radiative width @xmath111 kev which is comparable with our prediction in @xcite on the basis of an @xmath112 photon current exciting the flux - tube in a pion .      at high photon energies and low momentum transfer , @xmath113 , photoproduction of mesons",
    "is believed to have a significant contribution from the pion exchange mechanism .",
    "there is very little data available , but what exists is consistent with one pion exchange expectations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . if this is really a significant mechanism then we should expect the hybrids we have identified as having large @xmath95 partial widths to be produced prominently in photoproduction .",
    "in particular we noted that an isoscalar @xmath108 would be large in @xmath95 . a recent analysis of photoproduction of @xmath114 by the clas collaboration@xcite finds a large bump in the @xmath108 partial wave near 2 gev . given that we also expect this state to have a partial width into @xmath2 comparable to @xmath115 this signal is most interesting .",
    "as well as photoproduction of isoscalar / isovector @xmath108 in pion exchange , there is also the possibility of diffractive photoproduction where the photon fluctuates into a @xmath116 which fuses in a @xmath117-wave with the pomeron .",
    "we do nt currently have the tools to calculate a rate for this process , but we have no reason to expect it to be small - the vector meson is already in the required spin - triplet so the pomeron current could either excite the flux - tube by oscillating the quark or by interacting directly with the tube .    hence the @xmath108 exotic should be especially favoured in photoproduction : the @xmath118 coming from @xmath12 exchange and the @xmath119 from pomeron / gluon exchange .    for the case of pion exchange dominance , a study similar to that in @xcite , using the full theoretical formalism of photoproduction modeling could be carried out using the matrix elements found in this model .",
    "we have used the formalism in which currents acting on quarks can excite the flux - tube to consider the pionic decays of hybrid mesons .",
    "the pion is considered to act as a pointlike current which couples only to the quarks ( isospin ensures that it can not couple directly to the flux - tube ) and reasonable success in describing conventional meson decays is observed .",
    "previous studies of hadronic hybrid meson decays had assumed the need for pair production at some point on the flux - tube and had found that decay to a pair of mesons with identical spatial wavefunctions were forbidden . in the quark model with no spin - dependent effects , the pion and the rho have identical wavefunctions and this has lead to the expectation that the @xmath2 channel for hybrid decay should be suppressed .",
    "the model outlined here maximally breaks the @xmath120 symmetry and finds that @xmath121 rates can be large , which seems to be required by the data showing a @xmath5 resonance in the @xmath121 channel .",
    "detailed consideration of the model shows that the @xmath122 expansion of the pionic current is not under control and hence that numerical predictions may not be robust . in light of this",
    ", more general results were extracted which link @xmath121 partial widths of different hybrid states and which appear to be dependent only on the spin - orbit structure of the hybrid meson states .",
    "radiative decay widths of hybrids were discussed under the assumption of vmd converting @xmath123 and were found to be not necessarily small .",
    "this offers hope to the experiments intending to produce hybrids via photoproduction , especially for @xmath124 .",
