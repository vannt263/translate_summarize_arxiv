    "when a piston moves at constant velocity into a fluid , it generates a shock wave.@xcite this is a strong perturbation that drives the system far from equilibrium .",
    "studying the structural properties of the shock wave , and how equilibrium is restored behind it , we may extract valuable information on the fluid s transport properties , the damping of nonequilibrium fluctuations , etc .",
    "that is , we may use the shock wave as a probe to better understand the nonequilibrium response of the fluid .",
    "this is particularly appealing for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "their nonequilibrium behavior has attracted much attention during the last years.@xcite-@xcite this follows from two main reasons .",
    "on one hand , the dimensional constrain characteristic of 1d systems plays an essential role in many real structures , ranging from carbon nanotubes@xcite to anisotropic crystals@xcite , magnetic systems@xcite solid copolymers@xcite , semiconductor wires@xcite , zeolites@xcite , bose - einstein condensates@xcite , colloids in narrow channels@xcite , dna , nanofluids , etc.@xcite on the other hand , the simplicity and versatility of 1d models allow one to tackle fundamental questions in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , as those related to irreversibility , normal transport , equipartition , local thermodynamic equilibrium , etc.@xcite    in this way , it has been found that the low dimensionality can give rise to anomalous transport properties in 1d fluids . to be more specific , the _ single - file _ ( sf ) constraint characteristic of 1d fluids introduces strong correlations between neighboring particles , which asymptotically suppress mass transport @xcite and enhance heat conduction @xcite . in particular , it is currently believed ( see however @xcite ) that 1d fluids with momentum - conserving interactions and non - zero total pressure exhibit a thermal conductivity @xmath8 that diverges as @xmath9 when the system size @xmath10.@xcite however , there is no complete agreement yet on the exponent @xmath11 : there exist strong numerical and theoretical evidences pointing out that @xmath12 @xcite , although mode - coupling theories and boltzmann equation analysis predict @xmath13 @xcite , and other numerical results are closer to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "conservation of momentum seems to be crucial ; as soon as this symmetry is broken , normal heat transport is recovered.@xcite moreover , momentum - conserving 1d fluids typically exhibit other anomalies when perturbed away from equilibrium , as for instance dynamic non - equipartition of energy , emergence of multiple relaxation scales , energy localization , etc.@xcite in general , the behavior of 1d fluids far from equilibrium still poses many intriguing questions which require further investigation .    in this paper",
    "we probe the nonequilibrium response of a 1d model gas .",
    "in particular , we address the problem of an _ infinitely strong _ shock wave propagating into a 1d binary fluid , within the context of boltzmann equation.@xcite the shock wave characterizes the transition between two different asymptotic equilibrium states of the fluid . for strong shock waves ( to be specified latter ) , this transition happens within molecular scales , so kinetic ( boltzmann ) equations must be used .",
    "in fact , one may think of the shock wave problem as the simplest case study dominated by the nonlinearity of boltzmann equation.@xcite as we will see below , boltzmann equation provides a powerful tool to investigate the observed structural and relaxational anomalies in 1d fluids .",
    "kinetic theory methods have been applied with success to study strong shock waves in high - dimensional _ simple _",
    "fluids.@xcite however , in one dimension , a simple ( i.e. mono - component ) fluid constitutes a pathological limit.@xcite this follows from the fact that particles with equal masses in 1d interchange their velocities upon collision , so a 1d mono - component fluid can be regarded to a large extent as an ideal gas of non - interacting particles.@xcite we may restore ergodicity and relaxation in velocity space by introducing different masses .",
    "the simplest case is that of a binary mixture . in particular",
    ", we study in this paper a binary 1d fluid composed by two species of hard - point particles , with masses @xmath15 and _ equal _ concentrations .",
    "energy transport in this model has already been extensively studied via molecular dynamics simulations.@xcite    the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we write down the relevant boltzmann equation for our 1d binary fluid , and extend a method by h. grad@xcite to study the structure of an infinitely strong shock wave propagating through the fluid . the results of this approach are described in section iii . in particular , we study there the shock hydrodynamic profiles , paying special attention to the shock width and the relaxation toward equilibrium , as a function of the mass ratio .",
    "finally , in section iv we discuss our results .",
    "the boltzmann equation for a 1d binary fluid in a reference frame moving with the shock wave reads,@xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the probability density for finding a particle of type @xmath18 ( i.e. mass @xmath19 ) at position @xmath20 with velocity @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the gain term and collision frequency in the collision operator , respectively . they are defined as , @xmath24 index @xmath25 refers here to particle species other than @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are pre - collisional velocities that after collision give rise to velocities @xmath28 for the pair @xmath29 , namely , @xmath30 notice that eqs .",
    "( [ eqb1])([eqb2 ] ) only include the effect of cross - collisions between the different species , and no self - collisions between like particles .",
    "this is reflecting the one - dimensional character of our model fluid , and it is a main difference with boltzmann equation for mixtures in higher dimensions .    the structure of the shock wave can be deduced from eqs .",
    "( [ eqb1])([eqb2 ] ) subject to the boundary conditions , @xmath31 where @xmath32 . \\label{maxwellian}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the number density , temperature and macroscopic velocity at @xmath36.@xcite one usually chooses @xmath37 , which implies ( see below ) @xmath38 .",
    "this amounts to represent a flow of the fluid mixture from @xmath39 ( upstream or pre - shock region ) to @xmath40 ( downstream or after - shock region ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in the structure of an _ infinitely strong _ shock wave . in this way we can probe the response of the 1d binary mixture in the strong nonequilibrium regime , far from the linear response region.@xcite the strength of a shock may be defined in several ways .",
    "one of them is based on the ratio of downstream to upstream pressures , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "weak shocks have a ratio @xmath43 close to unity . in this case , the shock thickness is large as compared to the mean free path , and continuum approximations of the type of navier - stokes ( or euler , burnett , etc . ) may be used to characterize the shock structure.@xcite however , as @xmath43 grows the shock thickness becomes comparable to the mean free path , making inappropriate the application of hydrodynamic approximations . in this case kinetic equations , as those in ( [ eqb1])([eqb2 ] ) , must be used instead .",
    "we pay attention in what follows to the limit @xmath44 , or equivalently @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters entering the two limiting maxwellians ( [ maxwellian ] ) are related due to conservation of particle number , total momentum and total energy .",
    "such conservation laws can be expressed as the constancy of the corresponding fluxes , which yields , @xmath46 & = & n_-\\big[(m_1+m_2)u_-^2 \\big ] ,   \\nonumber \\\\ n_+\\big[(m_1+m_2)u_+^3 + 6u_+t_+   \\big ] & = & n_-\\big[(m_1+m_2)u_-^3 \\big ] .",

    "it must be noticed that these results come from the conservation laws characterizing the two - component fluid , and have nothing to do with the hydrodynamic behavior of the mixture . in this way",
    "it is not strange that even in non - hydrodynamic cases , as the equal mass version of our one - dimensional gas,@xcite the results ( [ final ] ) hold .",
    "the case of a infinitely strong shock has been studied in detail for mono - component gases in dimensions larger than one.@xcite extending a successful hypothesis by h. grad,@xcite we suggest here that the problem of a shock wave in our 1d mixture is in general well - defined in the limit @xmath49 , and that in this case the distribution functions @xmath50 can be decomposed into a singular part , @xmath51 , proportional to a dirac @xmath52-function on the upstream velocity @xmath53 , and a regular part , @xmath54 , smoother than the former .",
    "this is because for @xmath49 , particles in the upstream region exhibit a well - defined fixed thermal velocity when measured on the downstream velocity scale .",
    "hence , @xmath55 the singular particle densities @xmath56 control how important the singular component is at a given coordinate @xmath20 . in particular ,",

    "( [ regular ] ) for the regular component @xmath54 looks more complicated than the original boltzmann equations ( [ eqb1])([eqb2 ] ) .",
    "however , as advantage , it lacks the singular behavior characterizing for @xmath49 the whole distribution @xmath50 .",

    ". we have also assumed at this point that the regular flow velocity @xmath64 does not depend on particle species .",
    "this assumption seems natural given the one - dimensional character of the system , which forces neighboring particles to move coherently on average .",
    "therefore the problem of the shock wave structure reduces to computing the spatial dependence of 7 different flow fields , namely @xmath56 , @xmath63 , @xmath65 and @xmath64 , @xmath18 .",
    "it is important to notice that the maxwellian approximation ( [ maxw ] ) is not a local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) hypothesis , since it only affects the regular component @xmath70 of the distribution function .",
    "the singular , delta - like component @xmath71 accounts for the most important nonequilibrium effects . however , it is natural to question the validity of ( [ maxw ] ) for the present strong nonequilibrium problem .",
    "this approximation is just the zeroth - order term in a formal expansion of @xmath70 around local maxwellian behavior , in the spirit of sonine polynomials expansions , gram - charlier and edgeworth series , etc.@xcite one would expect that higher - order terms in this expansion could be relevant near the shock layer .",
    "in fact , such slight deviations have been observed in mono - component gases in higher dimensions.@xcite however , these small corrections have negligible effects on the shock hydrodynamic profiles,@xcite and therefore are not important for our discussion here",

    "in fact , boltzmann equation does not yield any useful information for @xmath160 in one dimension ( 1d ) : the gain and loss terms in the collision operator are equal in this case , so the collision term in boltzmann equation is zero ( see right hand side of eqs .",

    "as soon as @xmath162 , normal behavior is recovered . in particular , for @xmath0 slightly smaller than 1 , one expects both typical scales to be almost equal , as observed in fig .",

    "it seems also interesting to characterize the region where the fluid is far from equilibrium .",
    "a _ canonical _ measure of the scale or typical size associated to this region is given by the shock width @xmath168 .",

    "however , it is remarkable that despite the shock wave gets steeper ( @xmath168 decreases ) as @xmath0 decreases , the typical scale characterizing relaxation toward equilibrium , @xmath6 , increases with @xmath0",
    ". hence , although the strong nonequilibrium region is reduced as @xmath3 , the consequent fluid evolution to equilibrium slows down .",
    "in this paper we have studied the response of a one - dimensional binary fluid to a strong shock wave propagating into it , on the basis of boltzmann equation .",
    "this excitation drives the system far from equilibrium , therefore allowing us to investigate the structure of the fluid under nonequilibrium conditions and how equilibrium is regained asymptotically .    extending to fluid mixtures an elegant method by h. grad,@xcite we have obtained the shock hydrodynamic profiles characterizing the transition between the two different asymptotic equilibrium states .",
    "in particular , we determine the flow fields as a function of the mixture mass ratio @xmath173 . we find in general that all profiles sharpen as @xmath3 .",

    "heavy particles are much cooler than light particles right behind the shock , while the reverse situation holds in front of the shock , where heavy particles are now slightly more energetic than light ones .    in order to understand these results ,",
    "we have performed an asymptotic analysis of our equations .",
    "this reveals the emergence of two very different typical length scales controlling relaxation as @xmath3 . in this limit",
    ", the fluid evolves toward equilibrium in twos steps : ( i ) first , heavy particles quickly relax toward their asymptotic downstream equilibrium state , while light particles remain close to the upstream state ; ( ii ) at a much slower pace , light particles come to equilibrium . in this way",
    ", light particles ultimately control the fluid s global equilibration .",
    "far behind the shock layer , the hydrodynamic fields relax exponentially . here",
    "the multi - scale relaxation mechanism is also apparent , with two typical exponential scales , @xmath161 , @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , @xmath5 , associated to heavy particles , goes to zero as @xmath156 , while @xmath6 , which controls the global relaxation to equilibrium , increases as @xmath3 , converging to a constant .",
    "in addition , the size of the strong nonequilibrium region associated to the shock layer , as measured by the shock width @xmath1 , decreases as @xmath172 for @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the fluid s strong nonequilibrium behavior gets more localized around @xmath140 as @xmath0 decreases , despite its asymptotic relaxation to equilibrium , as given by @xmath6 , slows down with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "these results are specially interesting at the light of recent numerical studies of similar 1d binary fluids.@xcite in particular , simulations show that whenever the 1d binary fluid is perturbed away from equilibrium , the consequent relaxation happens in such a way that light particles always tend to absorb more energy than heavy ones , as predicted here .",
    "in addition , light particles are observed to equilibrate more slowly , therefore controlling the system global relaxation .",
    "this supports the presence of two different relaxation scales for @xmath3 , validating our theoretical results .",
    "the success of our boltzmann equation approach to describe some of the structural and relaxational anomalies observed in the 1d diatomic fluid would suggest extending the present approach to understand its anomalous transport properties ( see section i)@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible .",
    "anomalous transport in 1d is a direct consequence of the long - time power - law tails characterizing the decay of correlation functions in the fluid . the microscopic origin of these tails is associated to dynamically correlated sequences of collisions among fluid molecules , which are not described by boltzmann equation.@xcite that is , the main hypothesis on which boltzmann equation is based , namely the _ molecular chaos _",
    "hypothesis,@xcite breaks correlations present in the fluid which are responsible of the power - law tails .",
    "the strong correlations emerging in 1d fluids , and its role in the shock wave problem , are interesting issue which deserve attention.@xcite further work in this direction , taking into account these correlations in generalized kinetic theories , would be highly desirable to better understand the nonequilibrium behavior of simple one - dimensional systems .                            t.e .",
