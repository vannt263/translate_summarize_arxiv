    "observations of type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite all indicate the existence of mysterious dark energy ( de ) driving the current accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "the most obvious theoretical candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath7 , which can fit the observations well , but is plagued with the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "numerous other dynamical de models have also been proposed in the literature , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , @xmath8-essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , hessence @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , yang - mills condensate @xcite , ect .    actually , the de problem may be in essence an issue of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "however , by far , a complete theory of quantum gravity has not been established , so it seems that we have to consider the effects of gravity in some effective field theory in which some fundamental principles of quantum gravity should be taken into account .",
    "it is commonly believed that the holographic principle @xcite is just a fundamental principle of quantum gravity .",
    "based on the effective quantum field theory , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the quantum zero - point energy of a system with size @xmath9 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , i.e. @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the quantum zero - point energy density , and @xmath12 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "this observation relates the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff of a system to its infrared ( ir ) cutoff .",
    "when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle can be viewed as dark energy ( its energy density is denoted as @xmath13 hereafter ) .",
    "the largest ir cutoff @xmath9 is chosen by saturating the inequality , so that we get the holographic dark energy density @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a numerical constant characterizing all of the uncertainties of the theory , and its value can only be determined by observations . if we take @xmath9 as the size of the current universe , for instance the hubble radius @xmath16 , then the dark energy density will be close to the observational result . however , hsu @xcite pointed out this yields a wrong equation of state ( eos ) for de .",
    "li @xcite suggested to choose the future event horizon of the universe as the ir cutoff .",
    "this is the original holographic dark energy model .",
    "subsequently , cai proposed @xcite that the age of the universe can be chosen as the ir cutoff , and this model is called agegraphic dark energy model . a new version of this model replacing the age of the universe by the conformal age of the universe was also discussed @xcite , in order to avoid some internal inconsistencies in the original model . furthermore , gao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to consider the average radius of the ricci scalar curvature as the ir cutoff , and this model is called holographic ricci dark energy model .",
    "( for convenience , hereafter we will call them hde , ade , and rde , respectively . )",
    "although these three models have been studied widely @xcite , so far no comparison of them has been made .",
    "it would be very interesting to constrain the holographic dark energy models by using the latest observational data , and then make a comparison for them by using the proper model selection criterion .",
    "this will be done in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the holographic de models . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the method of data analysis , as well as the model selection criterion . in section 4",
    ", we show the results of the cosmological constraints , and we also use the bayesian evidence ( be ) to make a comparison .",
    "section 5 is a short summary . in this work ,",
    "we assume today s scale factor @xmath17 , so the redshift @xmath18 satisfies @xmath19 ; the subscript `` 0 '' always indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity , and the unit with @xmath20 is used .",
    "in this section , we shall briefly review the holographic de models . for",
    "a spatially flat ( the assumption of flatness is motivated by the inflation scenario ) friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with matter component @xmath21 and dark energy component @xmath13 , the friedmann equation reads @xmath22 or equivalently , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hubble parameter , @xmath25 is the present fractional matter density , and @xmath26 is the fractional dark energy density . in this work , for simplicity , we shall not discuss the issue of interaction between dark matter and dark energy , so we have @xmath27 @xmath28 where the over dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the eos of de .      for this model ,",
    "the ir cutoff is chosen as the future event horizon of the universe , @xmath31 taking derivative for eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) with respect to @xmath32 and making use of eq .",
    "( [ rh ] ) , we get @xmath33 combining eqs .",
    "( [ e ] ) and ( [ derivative ] ) , we obtain the eos for hde , @xmath34 directly taking derivative for @xmath35 , and using eq .",
    "( [ rh ] ) , we get @xmath36 where @xmath37 . from eqs .",
    "( [ fri ] ) , ( [ m ] ) , ( [ e ] ) , and ( [ whde ] ) , we have @xmath38 for this case .",
    "so , we have the equation of motion , a differential equation , for @xmath39 , @xmath40 since @xmath41 , we get @xmath42 solving numerically eq .",
    "( [ density 2 ] ) and substituting the corresponding results into eq .",
    "( [ ez ] ) , the key function @xmath43 can be obtained .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are two model parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath15 , in the hde model .",
    "since there are some internal inconsistencies in the original ade model , we will discuss the new version of ade model which suggests to choose the conformal age of the universe @xmath44 as the ir cutoff , so the density of ade is @xmath45 to distinguish from the hde model , a new constant parameter @xmath46 is used to replace the old parameter @xmath15 .",
    "taking derivative for eq .",
    "( [ rhoq ] ) with respect to @xmath47 and making use of eq .",
    "( [ etaq ] ) , we get @xmath48 this means that the eos of ade is @xmath49 taking derivative for @xmath50 , and considering eq .",
    "( [ etaq ] ) , we obtain @xmath51 in this case , we have @xmath52 hence , we get the equation of motion for @xmath53 , @xmath54 and this equation can be rewritten as @xmath55 as in @xcite , we choose the initial condition , @xmath56 , at @xmath57 , then eq .",

    "( [ keyq ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ ez ] ) , the key function @xmath43 can be obtained .",
    "notice that once @xmath46 is given , @xmath58 can be natural obtained by solving eq.([keyq ] ) , so the ade model is a single - parameter model .      for a spatially flat frw universe ,",
    "the ricci scalar is @xmath59 as suggested by gao et al .",
    "@xcite , the energy density of de is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a positive numerical constant to be determined by observations . comparing to eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) , it is seen that if we identify the ir cutoff @xmath9 with @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 . as pointed out by cai et al .",
    "@xcite , the rde can be viewed as originated from taking the causal connection scale as the ir cutoff in the holographic setting . now",
    "the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath64 and this equation can be further rewritten as @xmath65 where @xmath66 . solving this equation , and using the initial condition @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 there are also two model parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath61 , in rde model .",
    "in the following , we constrain the model parameters of these three de models by using the latest observational data including the union+cfa3 sample of 397 snia , the shift parameter of the cmb given by the five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap5 ) observations , and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "first , we consider the latest 397 union+cfa3 snia data , the distance modulus @xmath69 , compiled in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "this dataset add the cfa3 sample to the 307 union sample @xcite .",
    "the theoretical distance modulus is defined as @xmath70 where @xmath71 with @xmath72 the hubble constant @xmath73 in units of 100 km / s / mpc , and @xmath74 is the hubble - free luminosity distance @xmath75 ( here @xmath76 is the physical luminosity distance ) in a spatially flat frw universe , and here @xmath77 denotes the model parameters .",

    "the parameter @xmath83 is a nuisance parameter but it is independent of the data and the dataset . following @xcite , the minimization with respect to @xmath83 can be made trivially by expanding the @xmath78 of eq .",

( [ ochisn ] ) has a minimum for @xmath88 at @xmath89 since @xmath90 , instead minimizing @xmath91 one can minimize @xmath92 which is independent of the nuisance parameter @xmath83 .",
    "next , we consider the constraints from cmb and lss observations . for the cmb data , we use the cmb shift parameter @xmath93",
    "; for the lss data , we use the parameter @xmath94 of the bao measurement .",
    "it is widely believed that both @xmath93 and @xmath94 are nearly model - independent and contain essential information of the full cmb and lss bao data .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath93 is given by @xcite @xmath95 where the redshift of recombination @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath93 relates the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface , the comoving size of the sound horizon at @xmath97 and the angular scale of the first acoustic peak in cmb power spectrum of temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the measured value of @xmath93 has been updated to be @xmath98 from wmap5 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 from the measurement of the bao peak in the distribution of sdss luminous red galaxies is defined as @xcite @xmath99^{2/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath100 .",
    "the sdss bao measurement @xcite gives @xmath101 , where the scalar spectral index is taken to be @xmath102 as measured by wmap5 @xcite .",
    "notice that both @xmath93 and @xmath94 are independent of @xmath73 , thus these quantities can provide robust constraint as complement to snia data on the holographic dark energy models .",
    "the total @xmath78 is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is given by eq .",
    "( [ tchi2sn ] ) , and the latter two terms are defined as @xmath105 and @xmath106 where the corresponding @xmath107 errors are @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively . as usual , assuming the measurement errors are gaussian , the likelihood function @xmath110 the model parameters yielding a minimal @xmath111 and a maximal @xmath112 will be favored by the observations .      for comparing different models , a statistical variable must be chosen .",
    "the @xmath113 is the simplest one which is widely used .",
    "however , for models with different number of parameters , the comparison using @xmath78 may not be fair , as one would expect that a model with more parameters tends to have a lower @xmath78 . in this work , we will use the be as a model selection criterion .",
    "the be of a model @xmath114 takes the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the likelihood function given by the model @xmath114 and parameters @xmath117 ( @xmath118 denotes the data ) , and @xmath119 is the priors of parameters .",
    "it is clear that a model favored by the observations should give a large be . since be is the average of the likelihood of a model over its prior of the parameter space and automatically includes the penalties of the number of parameters and data , it is more reasonable and unambiguous than the @xmath120 in model selection @xcite .",
    "the logarithm of be can be used as a guide for model comparison @xcite , and we choose the @xmath121cdm as the reference model : @xmath122 .",

    "<S> we perform the best - fit analysis on these three models , by using the latest observational data including the union+cfa3 sample of 397 type ia supernovae ( snia ) , the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) given by the five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap5 ) observations , and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis shows that for hde , @xmath0 ; for rde , @xmath1 ; for ade , @xmath2 . among these models </S>",
    "<S> , hde model can give the smallest @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we also use the bayesian evidence ( be ) as a model selection criterion to make a comparison . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that for hde , ade , and rde , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> so , it seems that the hde model is more favored by the observational data . </S>"
