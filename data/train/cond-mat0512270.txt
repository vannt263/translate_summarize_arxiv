    "in fact , it can lead to very bad configurations which may even prevent the dmrg algorithm from converging to the proper ground - state energy .",
    "the accuracy and convergence of the dmrg for given computer resources is intimately related to the entanglement of the dmrg blocks during the renormalization group step .",

    "recent studies  @xcite indicate that entanglement localization and interaction localization actually compete and should be treated on an equal footing .",
    "the central goal remains the development of a standard procedure to find a basis state transformation for a given model which minimizes the block entanglement and thereby optimizes the performance of the dmrg algorithm in terms of required computational resources for a given demand on accuracy .    in this work",

    "again , the site entropy , the block entropy and the schmidt number decrease smoothly as a function of the interaction strength . in comparison with the purely local interaction  @xmath31",
    "the schmidt number has almost doubled .",
    "the increase in block entropy and schmidt number is very similar when we study the effect of the spin - flip term  @xmath33 in  ( [ alltheus ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - ham ]  ( d ) .",
    "the result of the analysis of @xmath139 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : terms89 ] . apparently , the spin exchange between neighboring sites creates entanglement similar to the exchange of pairs . in comparison of the effect of @xmath31 on the one - hand side and @xmath32 , @xmath33 on the other",
    "we conclude that not only the number of links and their strength but also the type of coupling plays an important role for the entanglement .",
    "but as a function of @xmath13 for the pair - hopping term only , @xmath140 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - ham ]  ( d).[fig : terms89 ] ]      ( a ) and for the super - site representation in fig .",
    "[ fig : hub - transf ] for @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( exact calculation).[fig : super - site ] ]    originally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hub - transf ] , the transformed hubbard model  ( [ eq : unitary ] ) is defined on a two - chain geometry with purely local interaction and electron transfers between neighboring sites .",
    "one may wonder whether the analysis of subsection  [ subsec : densityinteractions ] is adequate because it is based on the single - chain geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - ham ] .",
    "in order to clarify this issue , we reduce the number of quantum channels between the dmrg blocks by forming ` super - sites ' from lattice sites of type  @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this representation a lattice with @xmath141 sites and @xmath142 degrees of freedom per site is formed , plus two end sites with @xmath61 degrees of freedom , and open boundary conditions apply .",
    "for @xmath112 for @xmath143 , @xmath103.[fig : super - site - n34 ] ]    the two sites at the boundaries have the same site entropy for both models . in the super - site representation",
    "we halve the length of the system so that sites in the interior of the chain carry an entropy which is twice as large as for sites in the hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a comparison of the block entropies is only meaningful for blocks which contain the same number of sites , i.e. , @xmath144 in fig .",
    "[ fig : super - site ] .",
    "as expected , for these block lengths they agree for both models .",
    "the total quantum information is essentially the same for both configurations .",
    "this observation is again readily explained by the fact that there are two quantum channels between the dmrg blocks in both representations .",
    "this is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig : super - site - n34 ] for @xmath112 and @xmath143 , @xmath103 using maximum @xmath145 block states .    the advantage that the transformed hubbard model in the super - site representation is only of length @xmath146 is more than compensated by the fact that during the numerical calculation there are @xmath142 degrees of freedom for the two intermediate sites @xmath147 and @xmath148 in the superblock representation .",
    "this higher demand for computational resources can be reduced if instead of two intermediate sites in the superblock representation only a single site is used .",
    "the modification of the dmrg in this direction is possible  @xcite .",
    "we have constructed a unitary transformation between basis states for the one - dimensional hubbard model subject to periodic boundary conditions so that open boundary conditions apply for the transformed hamiltonian . despite the fact that the one - particle and two - particle interaction matrices link nearest and next - nearest neighbors only , the performance of the density - matrix renormalization group method for the transformed hamiltonian does not improve significantly because some of the new interactions act as independent quantum channels which generate the same level of entanglement as periodic boundary conditions in the original formulation of the hubbard model .    the total quantum correlation in the system for the transformed model decreases only for small interaction strengths and for very short chain lengths .",
    "therefore , this approach can not be used to improve the performance of the dmrg for reasonable system sizes .",
    "we have shown that the localization of interactions alone does not improve the performance of the dmrg . instead , it is affected more significantly by the number and the strength of the various quantum channels between the dmrg blocks .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results contribute to a better understanding of the entanglement production within the dmrg .",
    "we propose to implement the communication length for the construction of an optimal basis and the proper ordering of lattice sites .",
    "the expected reduction of the block entanglement should improve the performance of the dmrg for hamiltonians with long - range electron transfers and interactions .",
