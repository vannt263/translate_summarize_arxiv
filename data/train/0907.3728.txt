    "observational evidence from a variety of angles indicates that galaxy interactions and mergers of galaxies can lead to dramatically - enhanced star formation @xcite .",
    "this appears to hold true at all redshifts where one can recognize mergers through galaxy morphologies ( @xmath11 with rest - frame optical morphologies ; @xcite ; @xmath12 using less certain uv morphologies @xcite ) . ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , representing the highest - intensity star formation events at low redshifts ,",
    "are almost invariably hosted by merging galaxies @xcite . for a number of applications",
    "the quantity of interest is the _ average _ enhancement in star formation ( sf ) triggered by merging ( ensemble average over the population of major mergers / interactions , or equivalently , temporal average over major merger events during a merger lifetime ) , not the high - intensity tail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite carefully quantified the star formation rate ( sfr ) enhancement in mergers in low - mass halos at low redshift , using the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "they found that roughly 1/4 of galaxies in close pairs ( separated by @xmath13kpc ) in low - mass halos with @xmath14 have sfr enhancements of a factor of five or more , assuming a stellar @xmath15 , appropriate for a star - forming blue galaxy with a @xcite stellar imf . ] .",
    "it has also been noted that the strong decrease of the cosmic sfr density between @xmath10 and @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was not dissimilar from the relatively rapid drop in merger rate inferred ( at that time ) from close pairs and morphologically - selected mergers @xcite .",
    "if much of the star formation at @xmath17 were triggered by merging , the apparent similarity in evolution between sfr and merger rate would be a natural consequence .",
    "more recently , studies of the fraction of star formation in morphologically - selected interacting and merging galaxies at intermediate redshifts @xmath18 have demonstrated that , in fact , the bulk of star formation is in quiesciently star - forming disk - dominated galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly , it has long been argued that early - type ( elliptical and lenticular ) galaxies are a natural outcome of galaxy mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any hierarchical cosmogony mergers",
    "are expected to play a large role ; a wide range of work  observations of the increasing number density of non - star - forming early - type galaxies from @xmath10 to the present @xcite , the kinematic and stellar populations of local early - type galaxies @xcite , or the joint evolution of the stellar mass function and star formation rates of galaxies @xcite  has given support to the notion that at least some of the early - type galaxies assembled at @xmath18 have done so through galaxy merging .",
    "in such a picture , the average sfr enhancement from merging is of interest for interpreting the sf and chemical enrichment history of early - type galaxies , inasmuch as it gives an idea of what kind of fraction of stars in present - day early - type galaxies we can expect to have formed in the burst mode , and what fraction we can expect to have formed in a quiescent mode in the progenitor galaxies .",
    "direct observational constraints on the enhancement in sfr caused by merging provide an important calibration for modeling triggered star formation in cosmologically - motivated galaxy formation models .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of interacting galaxies in which gas and star formation are explicitly modeled have demonstrated that torques resulting from the merger can efficiently strip gas of its angular momentum , driving it to high densities and leading to significant enhancement in star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , state - of - the - art cosmological simulations lack the dynamic range to accurately simulate the internal structure of galaxies in significant volumes , so estimates of the global implications of merger - driven star formation enhancement have had to rely on semi - analytic calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . furthermore ,",
    "as the progenitor properties play a key role in the simulated sfr enhancements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , inaccurate progenitor property values ( e.g. , incorrect gas fraction or internal structure ) will lead to incorrect estimates for the average fraction of sf in mergers even if the sf in each individual merger were modeled perfectly .    therefore , to constrain galaxy evolution models and to understand the physical processes responsible for the main mode of star formation at @xmath18 , it is of interest to determine observationally the typical enhancement in sfr averaged over the duration of the entire major ( stellar - mass ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 ) galaxy merger or interaction and to constrain the overall fraction of sf triggered by mergers / interactions at intermediate redshift . in a companion paper @xcite",
    "we focus on the rate of merging and also present a preliminary exploration of the average change in the sfr caused by late - stage major and minor merging , finding an average mild enhancement within the restrictions imposed by the sample size . in this paper",
    "we present a statistically - robust analysis of the properties of star - forming galaxies at @xmath3 including all relevant merger phases and aimed at providing a satisfactory answer to two key questions . what is the average enhancement in star formation rate as a function of galaxy pair separation compared to their sfr before the interaction ?",
    "what fraction of star formation is directly triggered by major mergers and interactions ?",
    "there are a number of conceptual and practical challenges in such an experiment .",
    "enhancements in sfr produce both a boost in luminosity , but also increase dust content and extinction . at a minimum , one therefore needs dust - insensitive sfr indicators . in addition , simulations have indicated that sf can be enhanced at almost all phases of an interaction from first passage through to after coalescence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; although close pairs will inevitably include some fraction of galaxies before first pass and galaxies with unbound orbits . therefore , an analysis needs to include both close pairs of galaxies ( those before coalescence ) and morphologically - classified mergers ( primarily those near or after coalescence ) .",
    "morphological classification is not a straightforward art ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comparison between automated classifications and visual morphologies ) , even in ideal cases @xcite . finally , galaxy mergers are rare and short - lived , necessitating large surveys to yield substantive samples of mergers .    in this work ,",
    "we address these challenges as far as possible ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we use estimates of redshift and stellar mass from the combo-17 survey @xcite to define and characterize the sample .",
    "stellar mass selection should limit the effect of enhanced star formation and dust content on the sample definition .",
    "we use sfr indicators that are constructed to be dust extinction insensitive , by combining ultraviolet ( uv ; direct , unobscured light from young stars ) and infrared ( ir ; thermal emission from heated dust , powered primarily by absorption of uv light from young stars ) radiation @xcite .",
    "finally , we study a very well - characterized sample of galaxy pairs at @xmath3 using weighted projected two - point correlation functions @xcite , supplementing them at very small separations @xmath19kpc with very close pairs or merger remnants morphologically selected from two wide hst mosaics , gems @xcite and stages @xcite , in an attempt to account for all stages of galaxy interactions .",

    "were detected in x - rays , in good agreement with the results found by i.e. @xcite or @xcite .    yet",
    ", there are two limitations of this estimate .",
    "firstly , this does not account for any contribution from x - ray undetected compton - thick agn , which could drive up the expected contribution from agn in our sample .",
    "for example , applying an @xmath54 cut to the sample of @xcite , we estimate the fraction of x - ray undetected agn to be @xmath55 , while @xcite find @xmath56 of local agn to be compton thick . on this basis",
    ", it is conceivable that up to 30% of 24 luminosity is from galaxies with agn .",
    "secondly , even in galaxies with agn , not all of the ir emission will come from the agn .",
    "although the data does not currently exists to answer this question conclusively , it is possible to make a rough estimate of the effect . in order to estimate the fraction of mid - ir light that comes from the agn ( as opposed to star formation in the host ) , we have made use of the results of @xcite , who attempted to structurally decompose mid - infrared imaging from _ infrared space observatory _ for a sample of both seyfert 1 and 2 agn in the local universe , some of which are very highly - obscured in x - rays . analyzing the results in tables 2 and 3 of @xcite",
    ", we have found that only a small fraction of the ir radiation at @xmath57 ( in this paper we work at rest - frame 13 - 17@xmath0 m ) comes from the central parts of the galaxies in the seyfert 2 population , finding a total contribution of : @xmath58 this result should be viewed as indicative only : obviously , the systems being studied will be different in detail from those in our sample .",

    "the goal of this paper is to explore the star formation rate in major mergers between massive galaxies , from the pre - merger interaction to after the coalescence of the nuclei .",
    "we chose a stellar mass  limited sample with @xmath62 in the redshift slice of @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "this roughly corresponds to @xmath64 for galaxies in the red sequence and @xmath65 for blue objects .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we use weighted projected two - point correlation functions because redshift uncertainties ( 1 - 3% ) from combo-17 translate to line - of - sight distance errors of @xmath79 mpc , necessitating the use of projected correlation functions to explore the properties of close physical pairs of galaxies @xcite . for our sample at hand",
    ", we estimate the weighted ( or marked ) two - point correlation function @xcite , using both the sfr and the specific sfr ( sfr per unit stellar mass ) as the weight .",
    "the projected correlation function @xmath80 is the integral along the line of sight of the real - space correlation function :    @xmath81^{1/2})d\\pi,\\ ] ]    where @xmath82 is the distance between the two galaxies projected on the plane of sky and @xmath83 the line - of - sight separation .",
    "a simple estimator for this unweighted correlation function is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the path length being integrated over , @xmath86 is the histogram of separations between real galaxies and @xmath87 is the histogram of separations between galaxies in a randomly - distributed catalogue ( this is the same estimator used in @xcite ) . basically , the aim is to find the excess probability ( compared to a random distribution ) of finding a galaxy at a given distance of another galaxy .",
    "this estimator accomplishes that by subtracting the random probability of finding two galaxies at a given separation from the probability in the real data sample and normalizing to the probability in the random case .",
    "other estimators ( i.e. @xmath88 $ ] or @xmath89 $ ] ) for the 2-point correlation function give results different by @xmath90 ( less than other sources of uncertainty ) .",
    "thus : @xmath91 @xmath92 where the sum is over all non - repeated pairs in the sample , and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) equals 1 only if the pair selection criteria are satisfied in the real ( random ) galaxy catalogue , and is equal to 0 otherwise .",
    "the first criterion is that the stellar - mass ratio falls between 1:1 and 1:4 .",
    "we further only allow a maximum redshift difference @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the error in redshift of the primary galaxy ( see equation  [ eqn : dz ] ) , and , depending on the case , either the primary or both galaxies in the pair have to be star formers ( see  [ results ] ) .",
    "we can then study the possible enhancement of ( specific ) star formation rate by means of a projected marked ( or weighted ) correlation function , which can be defined : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and , @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 is the mark ( or weight ) .",

    "it is worth noting that with our definition of the enhancement given in eq .",
    "5 the random histograms @xmath107 and @xmath108 cancel in the process of obtaining the expression in eq . 6 , so they are not used in the computation of our enhancement .    in the present work",

    "we will estimate the errors in our mark by means of bootstrapping resampling .",
    "a particular challenge encountered when constructing a census of star formation in pairs and mergers is accounting for systems with separations of @xmath37 ( which corresponds to @xmath109 kpc , the radius within which we can no longer separate two massive galaxies using combo-17 ; @xcite ) . in order to pick up the sf in all the stages of the interaction , we need to have an estimate of the sfr not only in galaxy pairs with separations @xmath110kpc but also in extremely close pairs and in recent merger remnants .",
    "we conduct our census of such close physical pairs by including in the @xmath111kpc range sources that are not resolved by combo-17 , but appear to be interacting pairs or merger remnants on the basis of visual classification of the @xmath112 resolution acs images .",

    "yet , there is a degree of subjectivity to what one deems to be a major merger remnant .",
    "many factors shape the morphology of a galaxy merger that are beyond the control of the classifier .",
    "bulge - to - total ( b / t ) mass ratios have an strong effect on both the intensity of the sfr enhancement and the time at which the intensity peak shall occur ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "orbital parameters strongly shape the development of easily recognizable tidal tails and bridges ( coplanar or not , retrograde vs. prograde , etc ) .",
    "prior dust and gas content of the parent galaxies ( ` dry ' vs. ` wet ' mergers ) will make a difference to the appearance of the final object during the coalescence .",
    "furthermore , merging timescales will depend on whether the galaxies are undergoing a first passage or are in the final stages of the merger .",
    "finally , there is a degeneracy between all these parameters and the relative masses of the galaxies undergoing the interaction , which makes difficult in some cases to distinguish the morphological signatures of a major merger from those of a minor merger .",
    "some of these factors ( e.g. gas fraction , b / t ratios , etc ) will also affect the enhancement of the sfr during the interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while there is considerable merger - to - merger scatter , encounters of two gas rich disk galaxies with parallel spins tend to develop , on average , the strongest morphological features , but at the same time are more likely to throw out large amounts of cold gas in tidal tails , preventing the funneling of this gas to the central regions .",
    "thus , samples selected to have the strongest morphological features may have an average sfr enhancement different from the actual mean enhancement .    one practical issue is that of passband choice and shifting .",
    "we choose to classify the f606w images of the gems and stages fields ( in stages because that is the only available hst passband and in gems for consistency and because f606w has higher s / n that the f850lp data ) .",

    "the correlation function can tell us what is the fraction with separations between @xmath232kpc and @xmath123kpc but we have defined merger remnants as objects which have _ already _ coalesced , so if we think in terms of the duration of the interaction instead of the separation between the galaxies , these objects would be _ beyond _ the reach of the correlation function , and have to be treated separately . in the denominator we have only divided by the total sfr occuring in _ all _ the galaxies contributing to any pair we can form with the already mentioned criteria . the difference between this factor and the total sfr calculated simply adding up the sfr of all galaxies in the sample is 5% and is a consequence of the few galaxies which are not paired with any other galaxy in the sample .",
    "yet , the fraction of the total sfr that occurs in pairs and remnants with @xmath142kpc separation does not immediately characterize the sfr _ triggered _ by interactions , because @xmath233 of sf should happen at @xmath126kpc anyway , as we show below .",
    "only the _ excess _ star formation in pairs and remnants should be atributed to triggering by interactions : @xmath234 again , a similar analysis for the sf  sf autocorrelation yields @xmath235 .",
    "these values for the excess are 12% lower than those in eq .",
    "[ eq : totfrac ] due to the total number of interacting systems , which is higher than the 8% of galaxies in close pairs mentioned before because it includes the merger remnants that are not taken into account by the correlation function method .    taking all this together",
    ", this analysis shows that only @xmath236 of the star formation at @xmath3 is triggered by major mergers / interactions .",
    "this may seem in disagreement with previous results from morphological studies .",
    "we therefore compare our results with those of @xcite and @xcite , who found that @xmath55 of the global sfr at @xmath237 is taking place in morphologically perturbed systems and with @xcite , where we find a similar result at @xmath191 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite performed a study of the total sfr occuring in visually - classified interacting galaxies in a thin redshift slice @xmath238 without imposing a lower mass limit ( only an apparent magnitude limit ) . that is the key difference between those earlier works and ours .",
    "we impose a mass cut in this paper of @xmath239 and @xmath240 for galaxies and visually - classified interactions respectively .",
    "e.g. the fraction of sfr in galaxies with @xmath241 that @xcite and @xcite identified as interacting / peculiar is 15 - 21% , compared to 20% in eq .",
    "[ eq : totfrac ] .",
    "only 1/6 of the star formation in the interacting / peculiar galaxies from @xcite and @xcite occurs in what we would designate as merger remnants , with the other 5/6 occuring in galaxy pairs .",
    "jogee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argued that 30% of star formation was in systems that they classified as major or minor interactions , with mass limits different from those used in this paper .",
    "this value is an upper limit to the fraction of star formation in major mergers where each galaxy has mass @xmath242 , both because of the effect of mass limits , and because minor mergers host much of the star formation in systems that they classified to be interacting .",
    "accounting for these differences , our result is in qualitative agreement with theirs .",
    "however , the key difference is that neither @xcite , @xcite nor @xcite try to quantify the _ excess _ of sf in interacting systems , as we do in going from eq .",
    "[ eq : totfrac ] to eq .",
    "[ eq : final ] .",
    "in summary , our new results here pose no inconsistency with earlier studies , but refine them by quantifying the physically more relevant quantity of sf excess .",
    "we have presented the average enhancement in sfr caused by major mergers of galaxies with masses above @xmath243 at @xmath244 , deriving that approximately 8% of the sf in the volume is _ directly _ triggered by major merging . as we have mentioned before",
    ", the sfr enhancement @xmath230 seems to be roughly independent of the quiescent sfr ground level present in the galaxy population , that is , insensitive to the drop in the sfr density of the universe since z=1 .",
    "if this is true , it means that the fraction of star formation directly triggered by galaxy interactions ( given a mass cut ) would depend only on the number of galaxies undergoing interactions . using the evolution of pair fraction found in @xcite",
    "we can infer a directly - triggered sf fraction of 1 - 2% in the local universe , as well as a fraction of 14 - 18% at z=1 . on the other hand , assuming no evolution in the pair fraction would keep the merger  triggered fraction at 8% between @xmath16 and @xmath10 .",
    "these numbers have to be taken extremely carefully by the reader , as we present here only a crude extrapolation of our results to different redshifts in order to get an idea of the importance of the merger - driven star formation in the universe .",
    "there are a number of limitations of our result that should be borne in mind .",
    "first , we can only include star formation rates @xmath245 for @xmath160 galaxies .",
    "therefore , our estimates of the sf contribution from merging may be an upper limit because the merger - driven boost in sfr will cause more objects to satisfy this criterion .",
    "second , there are uncertainties in the conversion of 24 to total ir , which could influence the excess star formation in close pairs or mergers by @xmath246 @xcite ; this could be addressed once longer - wavelength , deep _ herschel _",
    "pacs observations become available .",
    "we can only calculate an absolute upper limit by using the value of the enhancement found in the extreme case in which the 24@xmath0 m to tir conversion in all the interactions , independently of their luminosity , is calculated using an arp220 template .",
    "using as input @xmath247 for eq .",
    "[ eq : final ] we would find a directly triggered fraction of @xmath248 , consistent with an scenario in which the underlying level of sf is basically negligible and most of the new stars are being formed in the burst mode .",
    "third , it is conceivable that some enhanced star formation occurs in very late - stage merger remnants that were no longer recognized as remnants and hence were not included in this census .",
    "this is both a practical ( classification ) and conceptual issue : when does one declare a merger remnant a normal galaxy again ?",
    "nonetheless , despite these points , the analysis presented here has made it very clear that only a small fraction of star formation in galaxies with @xmath249 at @xmath3 is triggered by major interactions / mergers .",
    "star formation enhancement in mergers has been studied extensively with hydrodynamical n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , large - scale cosmological simulations lack the dynamic range to resolve the internal dynamics of galaxies , crucial for modeling the gas inflows and the associated enhancement in star formation .",
    "therefore , the majority of these studies ( except * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been of binary galaxy mergers with idealized initial conditions , typically bulgeless or late - type disks . in most studies ,",
    "the properties of these progenitor disks are chosen to be representative of present - day , relatively massive spiral galaxies such as the milky way .",
    "these studies have shown that the burst efficiency in mergers is sensitive to parameters such as merger mass ratio and orbit , and progenitor gas fraction and bulge content .",
    "therefore , any attempt to use these results in an ensemble comparison must somehow convolve these dependencies with a redshift dependent , cosmologically motivated distribution function for these quantities .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that star formation enhancement in mergers can also depend on the treatment of supernova feedback in the simulations .",
    "furthermore , the detailed star formation history during the course of a merger , particularly in the late stages , may depend on the presence of an accreting supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "let us consider the results from representative examples of such binary merger simulations , by @xcite , who studied a broad range of merger mass ratios , gas fractions , and progenitor b / t ratios , as well as exploring the effects of two different sn feedback recipes .",
    "the 1:1 merger of two `` milky way''-like progenitors ( shown in their figure 12 ) shows an average factor of @xmath250 enhancement in sf over about 2.5 gyr , and a larger enhancement of a factor of 210 for a shorter period of about 0.6 gyr .",
    "the overall average enhancement over the whole merger is about a factor of 2.5 , depending on the precise timescale one averages over .",
    "very large enhancements ( @xmath251 ) occur over a very short timescale , @xmath252 myr .",
    "this particular simulation represents the largest expected sf enhancement , as the burst efficiency increases strongly towards equal merger mass ratio . for mergers with 1:2.3 mass ratio ( figure 10 of @xcite ) ,",
    "there is an enhancement of a factor of @xmath253 for 2.53 gyr , and of 2.5 for about 0.6 gyr .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the star formation rate in the late stages of the merger , when the galaxy still appears morphologically disturbed ( see fig .  7 of @xcite )",
    "is _ depressed _ with respect to the isolated case .",
    "a diverse set of progenitor morphologies , ranging from ellipticals to late - type spirals , was studied by @xcite .",
    "overall , their results are qualitatively similar to those from @xcite .",
    "the simulations discussed so far aimed to reflect progenitor disks with gas fractions , sizes , and morphologies typical of relatively massive , low - redshift late - type spirals such as the milky way : gas fraction @xmath254 ; @xmath255 ; scale length @xmath256 kpc .",
    "however , @xcite show that the burst efficiency is strong function of progenitor gas fraction , in the sense that higher gas fraction progenitors have _ weaker _ fractional enhancements .",
    "the burst efficiency is a factor of eight lower for a gas fraction of 90 % than for the canonically - used value of 20% .",
    "it is worth noting here that we find the same level of sf enhancement in major mergers at @xmath212 and @xmath257 , where the gas fractions of the two samples are expected to be rather different ( see  [ compar ] ) .",
    "whether or not this is quantitatively at odds with the expectations of @xcite remains to be seen .",
    "on the other hand , recent results from @xcite show no difference between the strength or duration of tidally - triggered bursts of star formation in local universe and their higher redshifts counterparts , in good agreement with the present study .    to place results in a cosmological context , @xcite used the results from a large suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations @xcite to parameterize the dependence of burst efficiency and timescale on merger mass ratio , gas fraction , progenitor circular velocity , redshift , and the assumed effective equation of state .",
    "they implemented these scalings within a cosmological semi - analytic merger tree model .",
    "we applied our selection criteria to mock catalogs from @xcite , by comparing the fraction of sfr produced in the triggered mode in galaxies with @xmath258 in our redshift range which suffered a major merger in the last 500 myr with the total sfr occuring in galaxies @xmath259 .",
    "we found that approximately 7% of the sfr in the volume is produced in the burst mode triggered by major mergers .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the @xmath260 of the overall sfr being directly triggered by major interactions we showed in the previous section .",
    "to quantify the _ average _ effect of major mergers on sfrs in galaxies , we have studied the enhancement of sf caused by major mergers between galaxies with @xmath118 at @xmath3 .",
    "we combined redshifts and stellar masses from combo-17 with high - resolution imaging based on hst / acs data for two fields ( ecdfs / gems and a901/stages ) and with star formation rates that draw on uv and deep 24@xmath0 m data from _",
    "spitzer _ to form a sample a factor of two larger than previous studies in this redshift range .",
    "we then applied robust two - point correlation function techniques , supplemented by morphologically - classified very close pairs and merger remnants to identify interacting galaxies .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    1 .",
    "major mergers and interactions between star - forming massive galaxies trigger , on average , a mild enhancement in the sfr in pairs separated by projected distances @xmath261kpc ; we find an enhancement of @xmath262 considering the sf - all cross - correlation , where only one galaxy in the pair is required to be forming stars . for a similar analysis using the autocorrelation of star forming galaxies we find @xmath144 .",
    "our results agree well with previous studies of sf enhancement using close pairs at @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , the behavior of sf enhancement at @xmath183 , @xmath263 and @xmath10 appear to be rather similar , indicating that the average sfr enhancement in galaxy interactions is independent of the ` pre - existing ' sfr in the population .",
    "3 .   we combine our estimate of the average sfr enhancements in major mergers with the global sfr to show that overall , @xmath264 of the total star formation at these epochs is _ directly _ triggered by major interactions .",
    "we conclude that major mergers are an insignificant factor in stellar mass growth at @xmath18 .",
    "4 .   major interactions do , however , play a key role in triggering the most intense dust - obscured starbursts : we find that the majority of galaxies with ir - luminosities in excess of @xmath265 are visually classified as ongoing mergers or found in projected pairs within @xmath142kpc separation .",
    "this is not in disagreement with the small _ average _ sfr enhancement if the most intense sf bursts last only @xmath7myr .",
    "our results for the sf enhancement appear to be in qualitative agreement with the extensive suite of hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite and @xcite , who produce both intense , short - lived bursts of sf in some interactions , but yet produce average enhancements of only 25 - 50% averaged over the @xmath266gyr timescale taken to complete the merger .",
    "furthermore , we find excellent agreement between the fraction of the total sfr directly triggered by major merging measured here and the 7% calculated from mock catalogues obtained from @xcite .",
