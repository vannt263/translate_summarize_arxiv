    "luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) are actively star - forming galaxies with high infrared ( ir ) luminosity ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) .",
    "the arp  299 system of multiple galaxy components is commonly adopted as a prototypical lirg due to its ir luminosity ( @xmath68@xmath71000@xmath8 \\approx 6.7 \\times 10^{11 } l_{\\sun}$ ] ; @xcite ) , relatively nearby distance ( @xmath944.8  mpc ; @xcite ) and interacting nature .",
    "arp  299 consists of two main components , arp  299a and arp  299b ( sometimes referred to as ic  694 and ngc  3690 , respectively ) , both likely to host an active galactic nucleus ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of the star formation in lirgs is concentrated in their central regions , which is also the case in arp  299 .",
    "the milliarcsecond resolution of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) radio observations has proven that there is a rich population of radio supernovae ( sne ) and young sn remnants in the nuclear regions of arp  299a and arp  299b , within only @xmath9100@xmath7150 and @xmath930  pc from the centre , respectively @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite reported a lower limit of core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) rate of @xmath90.80  yr@xmath10 for arp  299a , suggesting that the bulk of the current star formation was taking place in the innermost @xmath9150  pc .",
    "the most recent estimate for the total ccsn rate of arp  299 is 1.6@xmath71.9  yr@xmath10 derived by @xcite based on ir and radio observations .",
    "so far , arp  299 has hosted seven optically detected sne and has been continuously the target of multiple systematic sn search programmes in the optical and near - ir ( nir ) wavelengths during the last @xmath915 yr ( for a summary see * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite carried out a study on the seven optically detected sne in arp  299 indicating that the stripped - envelope type ib and iib sne are more common and more centrally concentrated than other ccsne in arp  299 compared to normal spiral galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the authors explain the excess of type ib and iib sne to be caused either by the young age of the dominating star formation or a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) , see also @xcite . in the former case of still - young starburst only the most massive stars would have reached the end of their life cycle , exploding as stripped - envelope sne , in contrast with type ii sne with progenitors having lower mass and longer lifetimes . in the latter model",
    "the skewed imf produces an intrinsically higher ratio of high mass progenitors .",
    "however , these are both predicated on the assumption that the progenitors to stripped - envelope sne are massive , presumably wolf rayet like stars , whereas the results may reflect a more complex progenitor population of stripped - envelope sne .",
    "in fact , a number of recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have concluded that binaries must contribute a significant fraction of stripped - envelope sn progenitors .",
    "the reason why binary systems could be more common in lirgs such as arp  299 is unclear , although this can be related to a larger fraction of star formation taking place in high - density environments of young massive clusters @xcite .",
    "a similar trend of excess stripped - envelope sne has also recently been found in statistical samples of disturbed @xcite and ir bright actively star - forming galaxies @xcite , who argued metallicity effects not to be a dominant effect on this .",
    "we also note that the seemingly ` normal ' spiral galaxy ngc  2770 has hosted three ccsne which have all been type ib sne @xcite showing that such a ccsn distribution can also exist in a non - starburst galaxy by chance .",
    "this is paper  i in a set of two papers studying the nature of sne  2010o and 2010p , the two most recent optically detected sne in arp  299 , the initial results of which were used by the recent studies of @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present and discuss in detail the nir and optical follow - up data of these sne , including adaptive optics ( ao ) data obtained with the gemini - north telescope .",
    "the accompanying paper  ii ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) concentrates on the radio data obtained on sn  2010p probing the sn interaction with the surrounding circumstellar medium ( csm ) .    in section  2",
    "background information on sne  2010o and 2010p is given , in section  3 we present the nir and optical observations and in section  4 the results from the analysis are reported .",
    "the high - resolution pre - explosion data are studied in section  5 and the nature of the two sne is discussed in section  6 .",
    "conclusions are given in section  7 .",
    "the discovery of sn  2010o , located at @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( equinox j2000.0 ) , was first reported by @xcite based on unfiltered optical imaging carried out by the puckett observatory supernova search on 2010 january 24.37 and 25.34 ut .",
    "arp  299 was also observed by us in a monthly monitoring programme on 2010 january 18.2 ut using the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) in _ jhks _ bands , leading to a nir discovery of both sne  2010o and 2010p via comparison to a reference image , with sn  2010p located at @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( equinox j2000.0 ) .",
    "a confirming epoch of observations was obtained on 2010 january 23.1 ut .",
    "thus our independent nir discovery of sn  2010o precedes that of @xcite and provides tighter constraints on the explosion date . the fact that the puckett observatory did not report the discovery of sn  2010p already indicates a very high visual host galaxy extinction in the line - of - sight to this sn .",

    "however , the type ib origin of sn  2010p is ruled out by the late - time evolution observed at radio wavelengths , indicating that the sn is a type iib event , with a substantially longer rise time to reach the peak radio luminosity than previously observed for any type iib sn ( see paper  ii ) .",

    "the rise to the first initial light - curve peak is associated with shock heating of the extended low - mass hydrogen envelope followed by a declining light curve and recombination of the ionized hydrogen analogous to type iip sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the weak hydrogen features in the spectrum and the lack of this early light - curve evolution suggest that sn  2010p was not an extreme case of type iib sne with a relatively high mass of the outer hydrogen envelope , but instead had a hydrogen mass of @xmath1240.1  m@xmath2 and a more compact progenitor .",
    "@xcite placed a hydrogen mass lower limit of 0.1  m@xmath2 for type iib sne , which would classify sn  2010p as a type ib sn ; however , the late - time radio observations ( paper  ii ) rule out a type ib origin of sn  2010p and we consider the object to be a type iib event . interestingly , the very long rise time of hundreds of days to the radio maximum shown by sn  2010p ( paper",

    "we note that recent modelling results have suggested that some @xmath920  m@xmath128 stars could explode as type iib sne and experience variability in their mass - loss rate due to crossing the bistability limit shortly before the core - collapse , resulting in modulations in their radio light curve ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , consistent with the radio observations of sn  2010p .",

    "the study of high - resolution pre - explosion images of arp  299 reveals both sne to be close to , but not coincident , with extended sources that are likely massive and possibly blended clusters .",

    "we derive host galaxy extinctions of @xmath63 and @xmath130  mag for sne  2010o and 2010p , respectively .",
    "the @xcite extinction law is found to be the best choice to describe the host galaxy line - of - sight extinction to sn  2010o in the spiral arm of the a component of arp  299 , whereas in the case of sn  2010p the @xcite extinction law is found to be more consistent with the observations .",
    "the latter extinction law is thus found to better describe the dust properties of the ir bright c@xmath15 nucleus of arp  299 .",
    "future sn discoveries , with multiwavelength follow - up observations , in the nuclear regions of the major components of arp  299 could be used to independently map the extinction properties of this prototypical lirg and to study its sn population .",
    "this is a strong motivation for high - resolution ir searches of ccsne in the high sn rate lirgs such as arp  299 .",
