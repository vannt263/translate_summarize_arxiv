    "our main result is that the schemes defined by a pair of gale dual systems are isomorphic .",

    "the version of this valid for positive real - number solutions was used to give a new upper bound on the number of positive solutions of a zero - dimensional complete intersection of fewnomials  @xcite , to give a continuation algorithm for finding all real solutions to such a system without also computing all complex solutions  @xcite , and to give a new upper bound on the sum of the betti numbers of a fewnomial hypersurface  @xcite .",
    "the version valid for the real numbers leads to a surprising upper bound for the number of real solutions to a system of fewnomials with primitive exponents  @xcite . in section  3 , we offer two results about master function complete intersections that follow from well - known results about polynomial systems .",

    "its complexity depends upon the dimension @xmath16 and the fewnomial bound  , and not on the number of complex solutions to the system of master functions .",
    "that algorithm easily extends to find all nondegenerate solutions in the hyperplane complement @xmath133 , and through gale duality it gives a new continuation algorithm for all nondegenerate real solutions to a system of polynomial equations .",
    "moreover , the ideas underlying the algorithm lead to a generalization of  @xcite , giving the bound @xmath143 for the number of nondegenerate real solutions to a master function complete intersection and thus a bound for the number of nonzero nondegenerate real solutions to a system of @xmath17 polynomials in @xmath17 variables having a total of @xmath141 distinct monomials  @xcite .    these new fewnomial bounds are used to bound the number of connected components  @xcite and the sum of the betti numbers  @xcite of a fewnomial hypersurface .",
    "for example , theorem  1 of  @xcite states that the sum of the betti numbers of a hypersurface in @xmath144 defined by a polynomial with @xmath145 monomial terms is bounded by @xmath146 by gale duality , this gives a following bound for certain complete intersections of master functions .",

    "another interesting class of applications of gale duality is to transfer results about polynomial systems ( which have been extensively studied ) to systems of master functions , which have not yet attracted much attention .",
    "let @xmath151 be linearly independent elements of @xmath31 which are primitive ( that is , @xmath56 ) .",

    "[ co : kth ] let @xmath158 be degree @xmath159 polynomials which define an essential arrangement @xmath5 of @xmath160 hyperplanes in @xmath161 .",
    "then the system of master functions @xmath162 in the hyperplane complement @xmath11 has at most @xmath163 isolated solutions , counted with multiplicity .",
    "when the polynomials @xmath158 are general , the system  @xmath164 has exactly  @xmath165 solutions .",
    "[ ex : kouchnirenko ] for example , the master functions of figure  [ fig : mf ] and of the system   have weights @xmath166 these are primitive , so @xmath167 .",
