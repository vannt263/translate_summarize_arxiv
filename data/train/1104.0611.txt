    "understanding the structure and dynamics of confined fluids is important for processes such as wetting , coating , and nucleation .",
    "the properties of a fluid confined in a pore differ significantly from the bulk fluid due to finite size effects , surface forces and reduced dimensionality . in this work",
    "we report on a study of one of the simplest models that is still capable of reproducing the thermodynamic behavior of classical fluids , the lennard - jones ( lj ) system .",
    "the lj potential is an important model for exploring the behavior of simple fluids and has been used to study homogeneous vapor - liquid , liquid - liquid and liquid - solid equilibrium , melting and freezing @xcite .",
    "it has also been used as a reference fluid for complex systems like colloidal and polymeric systems .",
    "the vapor - to - liquid transition in confined systems has been studied intensively , and is well understood ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in this article we will discuss the liquid - to - solid transition in a slit pore and the process of the development of the solid phase . in the liquid phase , confinement to a slit induces layering at the walls .",
    "one could imagine this effect to facilitate crystallization .",
    "and indeed it is known that depending on the strength of the particle - wall interaction , the freezing scenario changes significantly @xcite .",
    "if the walls are strongly attractive , crystallization starts from the walls and at a temperature higher than without confinement .",
    "if the walls are strongly repulsive , crystallization starts from the bulk at a temperature lower than without confinement .    a well - distinguished layer of particles close to the wall can also , to some extent , be treated as a 2d system .",
    "the melting of true 2d systems has been studied both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "a large number of experiments on 2d melting were carried out in colloidal systems where colloidal particles contain a magnetic core , giving rise to a magnetic repulsion between particles that can be controlled by an external magnetic field ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the type of the scenario strongly depends on the shape of the potential .",
    "soft - core potentials melt via the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young ( kthny ) mechanism  @xcite , meaning that the liquid turns into a crystal going through an intermediate hexatic phase @xcite . for the hard disks",
    "system two different points of view exist  @xcite .",
    "since the lennard - jones potential is rather soft , the freezing of a single layer of lj particles can therefore be expected to proceed via the kthny mechanism @xcite , which significantly differs from the bulk nucleation scenario .    as we will show",
    ", it can be difficult to check whether the hexatic phase exists . to solve this problem several order parameters to characterize the bond - order",
    "were introduced in the literature .",
    "the correlation function of the local bond - order parameter @xcite that measures the nearest - neighbor - bond - angular order is commonly used .",
    "however , it can not distinguish between a hexatic phase and a heterogeneous system in the two - phase region .",
    "the distribution of the bond - angular susceptibility on various length scales was introduced to overcome this problem studying a hard disks system and lennard jones disks @xcite .",
    "later the search for a general and efficient method to determine all phases and bounds of the transition was continued .",
    "the scale analysis of the behavior of the fluctuation of the bond - angular susceptibility and the bond - orientation cumulant provided @xcite an evidence of a possible continuous transition in the system of hard disks @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the binder cumulant was applied in the analysis of the existence of the hexatic phase only for 2d systems and never for quasi-2d or 3d .",
    "the analysis of fluctuations of the bond - angular susceptibility within a layer was used already for studying the melting of thin films up to 20 layers @xcite .",
    "a modified scaling analysis of the bond - angular susceptibility @xcite was used not to check the existence of the hexatic phase only in 2d systems @xcite , but also in quasi-2d systems , for example @xcite .",
    "this raises the question , how the crystallization in a strongly confined quasi 2d system proceeds , i.  e. a system only a couple of particle diameters wide . in this case , it is not clear whether the system still behaves like being truly two dimensional , or whether it rather behaves similar to a bulk system .",
    "the solid - solid phase transitions of confined fluids in narrow slit pores were studied both at zero and at finite temperatures ( see references @xcite and references therein ) . for a confined lj",
    "fluid , the question if a hexatic phase exists in a quasi 2d system has been studied by radhakristan and coworkers @xcite for a ratio of wall - particle to particle - particle attraction varying between 0 and 2.14 and pores widths of 3 and 7.5 fluid particle diameters . for the narrower",
    "slit pore it was shown that around the freezing temperature the system exhibits a hexatic phase . with increasing wall attraction",
    "this temperature region becomes wider , i.  e.  an attractive wall facilitates the formation of the hexatic phase .",
    "the phase diagram for the wider pore with diameter 7.5 is more complicated . when the wall - particle attraction becomes bigger than the particle - particle attraction , at first a hexatic phase and",
    "then a crystal phase appear , however , only in the contact layers near the walls ; the rest of the system remains liquid .",
    "only when decreasing the temperature further the system crystallizes completely .",
    "the temperature range , in which hexatic or crystal phases are observed only in the contact layers , again widens with growing wall - particle attraction .",
    "this indicates that the wall - particle attraction facilitates the formation of a hexatic phase even in wider pores , however only in the layers close to the walls .",
    "the same group of authors also reported that in a pore , that can accommodate only a single layer , two second order transitions are observed , while already in a pore wide enough to accommodate two layers , both transitions are of the first order  @xcite .",
    "the different crystal structures of the frozen phase were studied by vishnyakov and neimark @xcite as a function of the size of the slit for this system .",
    "the distance between the walls was gradually increased up to a slit accommodating three layers .",
    "depending on the width of the pore , hexagonal or orthorhombic phases were observed in the layers .    in a recent article by page and sear",
    "@xcite it was shown that freezing is controlled by prefreezing in a similar system .",
    "nucleation of the bulk crystal is affected by the surface phase behavior . with increasing wall attraction , the bulk nucleation",
    "is smoothly transformed into nucleation of a surface crystal layer .",
    "xu and rice@xcite investigated theoretically a quasi 2d system of hard spheres and reported the dependence of the density at the liquid - to - hexatic phase transition on the thickness of the system , with wall separation changing from 1 to 1.6 hard sphere diameters .",
    "for the current state of art in crystallization of confined systems we recommend to consult recent reviews @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the influence of the confinement on the hexatic phase .",
    "we investigate a lennard - jones fluid at different values of wall - particle attraction during freezing and melting .",
    "the system is confined in an attractive slit pore with changing wall separation , being able to accommodate 1 or 2 layers . to characterize and distinguish the liquid , hexatic and solid phases we investigated several order parameters and compared their behavior .",
    "we show that the identification of a hexatic phase is depending on the order parameters one uses .",
    "there is some controversy in experiments regarding the observation of a hexatic phase  @xcite .",
    "we study how strong the system has to be confined to observe a hexatic phase , and whether such a phase can be observed also in multilayer systems , as predicted by radhakrishnan et al  @xcite .",

    ", temperatures are given in multiples of @xmath9 .",
    "the simulations were performed in a cuboid box with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath10- and @xmath11- directions and two walls positioned at @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the distance between the walls was chosen such that @xmath14 layers can be accommodated in the pore , namely @xmath15 . here",
    ", 1.12 is the distance at which the wall potential has its minimum , and 0.916 is the layer distance in an ideal fcc lattice with spacing one . therefore @xmath16 was either 2.24 or 3.16 for one or two layers respectively , while the other two dimensions of the simulation box were fixed as @xmath17 . the number of particles @xmath18 was chosen such that the density was kept constant at one particle per unit cube independent of the width of the slit , and therefore ranged from 44800 for one layer to 81600 particles for two layers . since the slit is narrow , layering in the two layered system",

    "on the one hand , since we do not observe any two - phase region between a hexatic and liquid phase , one can assume that the binder cumulant is oversensitive and can omit some points .",

    "we carried out a simulation study of the liquid - to - solid transformation of a lj fluid in a slit pore accommodating one or two layers and several ratios of wall - particle to particle - particle attractions . to investigate the possible existence of an intermediate hexatic phase that was previously observed not only in 2d , but also in quasi-2d systems @xcite",

    "studying the radial distribution function together with the decay of the bond - order correlation turned out to be insufficient , since , on the one hand , they characterize the system in a whole , so one can not conclude from their behavior if the system is homogeneous . on the other hand",
    ", they are also insensitive to defects , so one can not distinguish properly between a defective crystal and a hexatic phase .",
    "the scaling of different parameters turned out to be much more successful . with the help of the angular susceptibility one can easily check the homogeneity of the system .",
    "we consider the binder cumulant to be the most reliable parameter in distinguishing a hexatic phase , since it shows either existence or absence of it . in our study",
    "the temperature of transition computed with the help of @xmath104 does not coincide with the temperature where the fluctuation of the bond - order parameter has a maximum , which makes it possible to assume a first order transition in all cases @xcite .",
    "we observed signs of a possible intermediate hexatic phase only in the slit with extremely attractive walls and a single layer of particles , i. e. if the system is practically 2d , otherwise there is a single liquid - solid transition .",
    "this is in contrast to the works @xcite on a similar system , in which signs of a hexatic phase in the contact layers near the wall were observed even in systems with up to seven layers , at wall strengths comparable to our @xmath83 .",
    "these findings , however , were based on studying the behavior of global order parameters and scaling of @xmath33 only , which , as we have shown , are not sufficient to safely detect a hexatic phase .",
    "our results have implications for experimental studies on the hexatic phase  @xcite , since they show that even a monolayer requires a strong confining force to exhibit a true hexatic phase , while studies based on the decay of the rdf and @xmath21 can easily be fooled by defective crystals or coexistent phases .",
    "this might explain why some studies find a hexatic phase , while other studies of a seemingly very similar system do not ."
