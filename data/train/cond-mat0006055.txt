    "according to the scaling theory of localization ( abrahams , anderson , licciardello , and ramakrishnan , 1979 ) there can be no metallic state in two dimensions in zero magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "within this two decades - old theory , all carriers are localized in an infinitely large two - dimensional ( 2d ) system at zero temperature . with decreasing temperature the resistance",
    "is expected to grow logarithmically ( `` weak localization '' ) or exponentially ( `` strong localization '' ) , becoming infinite as @xmath1 .",
    "although this prediction was made for 2d systems of non - interacting particles , subsequent theoretical work showed that weak interactions between the electrons increase the localization even further ( altshuler , aronov , and lee , 1980 ) . in the opposite limit of very strong interactions between particles ,",
    "a 2d electron system is expected to become a wigner crystal ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , tanatar and ceperley , 1989 ) ; in the presence of even a small amount of disorder , such a crystal is expected to be pinned so that the system of crystallized electrons would not conduct at zero temperature .",
    "therefore , 2d systems were not expected to be conducting in either limit : weak ( or absent ) , or very strong interactions between carriers .",
    "experiments performed in the early 1980 s on different 2d systems confirmed these predictions .",
    "thin metallic films and silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) displayed the expected logarithmic increase in resistivity ( dolan and osheroff , 1979 ; bishop  _ et  al . _ , 1980 ; uren",
    "_ et  al . _ , 1980 ) . at low electron densities , an exponential increase of the resistivity of silicon mosfets as a function of inverse temperature",
    "was reported ( uren  _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1980 ) .",
    "the agreement between theoretical expectations and experimental results was convincing , and for nearly two decades , the question of whether a conducting state is possible in 2d was considered resolved .",
    "however , from time to time , indications appeared that the accepted view may not always be correct .",
    "finkelstein ( 1984 ) and castellani  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1984 ) considered the interplay of disorder and interactions and showed that for weak disorder and sufficiently strong interactions , a 2d system scales toward a state with finite non - zero conductivity as temperature is lowered .",
    "unfortunately , the conclusion was not very definite since the theory s range of validity was exceeded as this `` metallic '' region was approached .",
    "therefore the possibility of a 2d metal was not seriously considered .",
    "a number of experimental results also suggested that metallic behavior is possible in two dimensions . from an analysis of experimental data obtained in gaas / algaas heterostructures , gold ( 1991 ) concluded that a metal - insulator transition existed in clean samples .",

    "( 1993,1994a,1994b ) studied the phase diagram of the quantum hall effect in low - disordered si mosfets and gaas / algaas heterostructures and arrived at a similar conclusion . in such 2d systems , in high magnetic field , each landau level comprises a set of states with a spread in energy due to the presence of disorder .",
    "the conventional view is that these states are all localized except for those at the center of the energy distribution , which are extended . in the limit of zero magnetic field , these extended states are expected to float up indefinitely in energy ( khmelnitskii , 1984 ; laughlin , 1984 )",
    ". however , pudalov  _ et  al . _ and shashkin  _ et  al . _ found , contrary to expectations , that the extended states do not float up indefinitely in the limit of zero magnetic field , but coalesce instead at the fermi level , thus allowing for a metallic state at @xmath0 .",
    "these observations were not well - recognized and the conventional wisdom persisted that there can be no metallic state in two dimensions in the absence of magnetic field .    in recent years , however , systematic studies of the temperature dependence of the resistance in zero magnetic field in a variety of dilute , low - disordered 2d systems have suggested that this point of view may be incorrect . metallic behavior",
    "( resistivity that decreases with decreasing temperature ) has been observed down to the lowest accessible temperatures at electron ( @xmath2 ) or hole ( @xmath3 ) densities above some critical density @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "below this critical density , the behavior of the resistance is insulating , thus suggesting that a metal - to - insulator transition in two dimensions occurs as the density is varied . at the critical density , the resistivity is found to be nearly independent of temperature and of the order of the quantum unit of resistance , @xmath6  k@xmath7 .",
    "application of an external magnetic field of the order of a few tesla , either parallel , tilted , or perpendicular to the 2d plane , suppresses the metallic behavior and gives rise to an enormous positive magnetoresistance on both sides of the transition .",
    "neither the metallic behavior nor its suppression by a magnetic field is currently understood .",
    "the different models that have been suggested are briefly reviewed in section  [ sec : explanation ] . in section  [ sec : experiment ] , we summarize the key experimental findings .",
    "we concentrate mostly on dilute high - mobility si mosfets , a system in which the unusual effects are particularly strong . with few exceptions",

    "_ , 1999 ) in which the properties are quite different .",
    "the first experiments that reported strong metallic temperature dependence of the resistivity and attributed the unusual behavior to the existence of a metallic state and a metal - insulator transition in 2d were performed on very low - disordered silicon mosfets ( kravchenko  _ et al . _ , 1994 , 1995a ) .",
    "peak electron mobilities in these samples exceeded those in the samples used in previous studies by an order of magnitude , reaching more than @xmath8  @xmath9/vs at @xmath10  k. the very high quality of the samples allowed studies of the 2d system in a very dilute regime , i.e. , at electron densities below @xmath11",

    "a valley degeneracy of two is taken into account when calculating the fermi energy . )",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 thus assumes values above 10 in these samples . in the very dilute regime ,",
    "2d electrons are expected to form a wigner crystal if the disorder is weak ; a numerical simulation ( tanatar and ceperley , 1989 ) predicted this should occur at @xmath22 . in subsequent work ,",
    "chui and tanatar ( 1995 ) showed that solidification should occur at even higher density when disorder is present .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the 2d system is a strongly correlated liquid at @xmath23 .",
    "subsequent experiments in dilute silicon mosfets with different geometry and oxide thicknesses ( popovi  _ et  al . _ , 1997 ) confirmed the earlier findings , and similar behavior was reported in a variety of other 2d systems , including p - sige heterostructures ( coleridge  _ et  al .",

    "for densities just below the thick long - dashed curve , henceforth referred to as the separatrix corresponding to the critical electron density @xmath29 , the resistivity exhibits non - monotonic behavior : the resistance slowly increases with decreasing temperature for temperatures above a temperature @xmath30  k and decreases sharply at lower temperatures ; thus the behavior is like that of an insulator for @xmath31 and like that of a metal for @xmath32 . at still higher @xmath2 ,",
    "the resistivity is almost constant at high temperatures and drops sharply at lower temperatures , displaying strong metallic dependence of temperature .",

    "@xmath12 , the resistivity is almost independent of temperature , and changes in density of only 3% from @xmath4 cause strongly metallic or strongly insulating behavior .",

    "the resistivity at the separatrix between metallic and insulating behavior , although not universal , is of the order of @xmath42 .",

    "[ fig : scaling_t ] , values of a scaling parameter @xmath43 can be chosen ( kravchenko  _ et al .",

    "the scaling breaks down above @xmath48 , and at very low temperatures , where the resistance has a much weaker @xmath49 dependence .",
    "nonetheless , it is noteworthy that a satisfactory overlap is obtained for more than ten curves on each side of the transition over a temperature range from approximately 0.25  k to 2  k where the resistivity of each curve changes by an order of magnitude .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath43 is independent of the sign of @xmath50 .",
    "the inset in figure  [ fig : scaling_t ] shows @xmath51 as a function of the absolute deviation from the critical point , @xmath52 , on a log - log scale for both metallic and insulating curves and for three different samples .",
    "it is important to note that the dependence is a power law , @xmath53 , with approximately the same power @xmath54 for all three samples and for both metallic and insulating curves .",
    "in addition , it was observed that the metallic and insulating curves are reflection symmetric in the temperature range above 300  mk and below @xmath48 ( simonian  _ et al .",

    "the more dramatic the metallic behavior the better the scaling fits , as in high - quality si mosfets .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity on opposite sides of @xmath4 ceases to be symmetric as one moves away from the transition .",

    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity has not been definitively established on the metallic side of the critical carrier density .",
    "it was first suggested by pudalov ( 1997b ) that for electron densities where the resistivity is a monotonically increasing function of the temperature , it can be approximated by the expression : @xmath67,\\label{eq : exp}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are temperature - independent ( but @xmath2-dependent ) parameters , and @xmath71 is a constant of the order of 1 .",
    "this form is inconsistent with the resistivity - conductivity symmetry described above .",

    "the ratio @xmath74 decreases with electron density ( papadakis and shayegan , 1998 ; mills  _ et  al .",

    "we first consider high - mobility si mosfets , a system where the anomalous effects are particularly strong . at the critical electron density ( _ i.e. _ , at the separatrix ) in a high - quality sample , the resistivity is essentially independent of temperature from approximately 1  k down to about 35  mk , the lowest temperature reached in that experiment ( kravchenko and klapwijk , 2000 ) . just below the separatrix ( for `` just - metallic '' electron densities , @xmath75 )",
    ", the resistivity in mosfets decreases with decreasing temperature below @xmath48 down to the lowest accessed temperatures with no indication of an increase in resistivity at very low temperatures .",
    "note that the temperature reached in the experiment shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neu_rt ] is less than 1% of the fermi temperature , @xmath76 ( see the upper axis on the graph ) which is about 5  k in this experiment . thus , the electron system is definitely in the degenerate regime .",
    "we emphasize that the metallic temperature dependence clearly overpowers quantum localization , which is expected to be very strong at resistivities of the order of @xmath42 and higher , where @xmath77 , and at temperatures @xmath78 ( here @xmath79 is the fermi wave number and @xmath80 is the mean free path ) .    at higher carrier density ,",

    "this implies that @xmath68 in eq.[eq : exp ] may be weakly temperature - dependent rather than constant .",
    "of course , at such high densities the electron - electron interactions are no longer dominant and one expects to reenter the regime of weak localization as seen , for example , by bishop  _ et al . _",
    "( 1982 ) in mosfets with very high electron densities around @xmath83 @xmath12 .",

    "_ , 2000 ) rather than factors of two or more , the behavior near the critical carrier density is qualitatively different . the curves that look metallic at higher temperatures show a low - temperature upturn of the resistivity signaling a reentry into the insulating phase at sufficiently low temperatures ( simmons  _ et  al . _ , 2000 ; senz  _ et  al .",

    "combining the electric field data with the temperature data allows separate determinations of the exponents @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as was done for the superconducting transition in thin disordered films ( yazdani and kapitulnik , 1995 ) .",
    "the resistivity of si mosfets was determined as a function of electric field @xmath89 for different electron densities using @xmath90 ( @xmath91 is the sample width and @xmath92 is the distance between potential contacts ) and the electric field @xmath93 .",

    "as in the case of si mosfets , there is a distinct knee that serves as a demarcation between the behavior in low and high fields .",
    "unlike mosfets , the magnetoresistance in p - gaas / algaas heterostructures is anisotropic ; it depends on the relative directions of the measuring current , magnetic field , and crystal orientation .",
    "these effects were studied in detail by papadakis  _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) . in this system , there may be a contribution to the magnetoresistance anisotropy depending upon the angle between the current and the magnetic field due to finite thickness of the 2d layer as proposed by das  sarma and hwang ( 2000 ) .",

    "since the application of a parallel magnetic field suppresses the metallic behavior , it is reasonable to expect that in the presence of a fixed component of @xmath124  few tesla , the extended states should once again `` float up '' to large values , and the usual @xmath119 behavior would then be restored .",

    "various explanations have been suggested , ranging from non - fermi liquid states and different kinds of superconductivity to single - particle physics based on temperature - dependent scattering on charged traps and/or temperature - dependent screening .",
    "we now briefly review some of the models .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , the possibility that a metallic state can exist at zero magnetic field in two dimensions was first suggested by finkelstein ( 1984 ) ( see also castellani  _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1984 ) .",
    "in this theory , the combined effects of interactions and disorder were studied by perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) methods .",
    "it was found that for a weakly - disordered 2d system , an interaction parameter scales to infinitely large values  thus out of the perturbative regime  before zero temperature is reached .",
    "unfortunately the rg procedure fails as soon as this dimensionless coupling exceeds unity .",
    "however , as the temperature is lowered , the resistivity first increases slightly and then begins to decrease ( as often seen experimentally , see sec .",
    "iib ) , just as the coupling becomes too large .",
    "this suggests that a low - temperature metallic state might be achieved .",
    "the theory does not contain a metal - insulator transition ( in the absence of a magnetic field ) , nor is the nature of the possible metallic state revealed .",
    "however , an external magnetic field , via zeeman splitting , will drive the system back to the insulating state , in agreement with the experiments ( see sec .",
    "this scenario has not received general acceptance because the divergences which occur at non - zero temperature cause the theory to become uncontrolled .",
    "it should also be remembered that the approach is perturbative and based on a fermi liquid starting point . in the present context , as discussed earlier , @xmath24 is so large that the theory s detailed applicability is in question .    nevertheless , we may consider what happens within the rg scenario as the temperature is reduced further .",
    "the rg flow not only leads to a divergent interaction coupling but also to a divergent spin susceptibility .",
    "this has been interpreted as signaling either the development of local moments ( finkelstein , 1984 ) or of ferromagnetism ( kirkpatrick and belitz , 1996 ) .",
    "the latter is expected to occur at sufficiently large @xmath24 in the 2d interacting electron system ( ceperley and alder , 1980 ) .",
    "the onset of such time reversal breaking effects entails a crossover to a situation ( a different universality class ) in which the previously diverging coupling remains finite , even decreases , and eventually , at low temperature , an insulating state is once again obtained .",
    "thus , carried to its conclusion , the renormalization group description appears to indicate an intermediate region of metallic - like behavior but so far fails to produce a metallic state at zero temperature ( kirkpatrick and belitz , 1999 ) .",
    "however , the details of the various possible behaviors have not yet been worked out .",
    "the possibility of metallic behavior was reconsidered recently by castellani  _ et  al . _",
    "they argued that in the case of weak disorder , the theory remains under control in a wide temperature range if renormalization of the energy scale ( relative to the length scale ) is taken into account .",
    "they found a quite complex temperature dependence of the resistivity which at low temperature crosses over to a `` metallic '' power - law temperature dependence and then remains finite at @xmath57 .",
    "this behavior does not correspond to the exponential dependence of eq.[eq : exp ] , which is observed in most of the experiments . at the same time , a positive magnetoresistance in a parallel magnetic field was predicted to be proportional to @xmath137 , in agreement with both old and new experiments ( bishop , dynes , and tsui , 1982 ; coleridge  _ et al _ , 1999 ) .",
    "spin - flip scattering on magnetic impurities was also predicted to destroy the metallic state .",
    "recent experiments of feng  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1999 ) showing a low - temperature crossover to an insulating state in relatively low - mobility si mosfets were interpreted in this spirit .",
    "this theory is capable of explaining some of the experimental observations on the metallic side ( and not too close to @xmath4 ) , at least qualitatively . for further tests , experiments other than transport",
    "should be made ( magnetic susceptibility , tunneling , _ etc _ ) .",
    "it should be noted that strong temperature dependence of the hall coefficient , predicted by this theory , is not seen in the experiment ( pudalov  _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1999b ; sarachik  _ et  al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "recently , si and varma ( 1998 ) , building on the previous work , developed a theory which leads to a metal - insulator transition , without , however , giving a description of the metallic phase .",
    "a feature of the earlier rg approach is that the compressibility ( proportional to the inverse screening length @xmath138 ) is unrenormalized .",
    "this is valid at high enough density so that the screening is good and @xmath139 is less than the mean free path @xmath80 .",
    "si and varma pointed out that at the low electron densities ( large @xmath24 ) of the experiments , one might expect @xmath140 and thus a renormalization of the compressibility .",
    "they argued that for large @xmath24 , the interaction becomes unscreened at low temperature and the compressibility approaches zero , as might be expected as one nears a metal - insulator transition .",
    "si and varma calculated a large suppression of the conductivity which overcomes the weak increase found in the earlier rg analysis of finkelstein ( 1984 ) and castellani  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1984 , 1998 ) .",
    "this leads to a metal - insulator transition ( at which both conductivity and compressibility go to zero ) controlled by whether @xmath139 is larger or smaller than @xmath80 .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "iig , there are recent experimental determinations of the electron fluid compressibility ( dultz and jiang , 2000 , and ilani  _ et  al . _ , 2000 ) in p - gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "both groups found the compressibility tending to zero near the metal insulator - transition .",
    "this is what one expects if the insulating state is one in which the long - range coulomb interaction becomes unscreened ( si and varma , 1998 ) , as would also be the case in a disordered wigner solid ( chakravarty  _ et  al . _ , 1999 ) .",
    "a phenomenological approach to the problem was taken by dobrosavljevi  _ et  al . _ ( 1997 ) , who argued that the existence of a metal - insulator transition in 2d violates no general scaling principles for interacting electrons .",
    "they proposed a scaling analysis which showed that a disordered 2d system of interacting electrons should scale either to a perfect conductor or to an insulator in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "the analysis has a metal - insulator transition as a quantum critical point and gives the scaling collapse and the resistivity - conductivity symmetries near the metal - insulator transition which are observed in many experiments , as discussed in sec .",
    "these authors pointed out that the metallic state is very unlikely to be a fermi liquid since if the interactions were turned off the metallic behavior would disappear and the system would become an anderson insulator .",
    "pursuing this theme , the effect of disorder on a model of a 2d non - fermi liquid was discussed by chakravarty  _ et  al . _",
    "while the origin of the non - fermi liquid was not explained , they showed that for sufficiently strong interactions ( which would occur at low density ) , a non - fermi liquid state of interacting electrons is stable in the presence of disorder and is a perfect conductor ( as conjectured by dobrosavljevi  _ et  al .",
    "otherwise , the disorder leads to localization as in the case of non - interacting electrons .",
    "an approach which begins from the strong - interaction limit was taken by chakravarty  _ et  al . _ ( 1999 ) .",
    "they took the point of view that the insulating state at @xmath44 is due to formation of a disordered wigner solid (  wigner glass \" ) .",
    "a transition from insulator to metal at @xmath45 is due to the melting of this glass into a non - fermi liquid state characterized by short range magnetic ( singlet ) correlations .",
    "the latter might be stable against disorder as mentioned in the previous paragraph ( chakravarty  _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) . in the limit of high carrier densities , when the relative role of the interactions decreases ,",
    "the system should again become weakly localized , in agreement with experiments . for @xmath45 , a magnetic field",
    "quenches the singlet correlations and is predicted to drive the system into an insulating state .    at sufficiently low densities , a wigner crystal ( or glass ) is expected to form which will be pinned in the presence of even a small amount of disorder .",

    ", they obtained a non - monotonic temperature dependence of resistivity similar to that found in experiments near @xmath48 . in this model , however , at lower temperature @xmath142 , the metallic resistive behavior saturates .",

    "he and xie ( 1998 ) proposed such a transition in the two - dimensional electron system in si mosfets at low electron densities , with percolation occurring between a conducting liquid phase separated by regions of an insulating vapor phase .",
    "a percolation transition involving non - interacting electrons was developed by meir ( 1999 ) .",
    "he considered the system to be inhomogeneous , consisting of electron ( or hole ) puddles connected by quantum point contacts .",
    "the model is capable of explaining the metallic @xmath38 for @xmath2 close to @xmath4 , but it predicts the drop of resistance to be no more than a factor two in a degenerate system , while experimentally it is more than ten in si mosfets .",
    "meir remarked that in a non - degenerate system , the drop might be arbitrarily large .",
    "however , in the experiment , the dramatic drop of the resistance occurs only when the electron system is degenerate ( kravchenko _ et al_. , 1999a ) .",
    "the drop is also substantial at larger @xmath2 where the inhomogeneities , if any , are weak .",
    "in fact , all the percolation scenarios require the metallic phase to be inhomogeneous on some scale .",
    "it would be of interest to examine this issue experimentally .",
    "recent results of ilani _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) seem to indicate an inhomogeneous insulating phase , but a homogeneous metallic one .",
    "there have been several numerical attempts to solve the problem of interacting electrons in the presence of disorder ( _ e.g. _ , pikus and efros , 1994 ; benenti _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; denteneer _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; shepelyansky and song , 1999 ) .",
    "the number of electrons that can be treated in these calculations is limited and they are sometimes restricted to the case of spinless electrons .",
    "nevertheless , it is of interest that the effect of interactions is to cause some delocalization of the electrons .",
    "the recent availability of samples of exceptionally high mobility have made experiments possible in two - dimensional systems with very low densities of electrons or holes .",
    "this has opened a new largely unexplored regime of strongly - interacting physics where the following novel properties have been reported :    * a strong metallic temperature dependence of the resistivity ( @xmath145 ) is observed in clean dilute 2d systems at carrier densities above some critical value , while insulating ( @xmath146 ) behavior is seen at densities below the critical value .",
    "the metallic behavior starts at temperatures below some fraction of the fermi temperature and continues down to the lowest accessed temperatures , @xmath147 . at the critical density , there appears to be a transition from a metallic - like phase to a strongly localized one .",
    "the latter phase is what is expected for 2d systems under the conditions where metallic behavior is seen in the present experiments . *",
    "metallic behavior persists to rather high carrier densities ( smaller @xmath24 ) but its relative strength decreases with density .",
    "a weak insulating temperature dependence reminiscent of anderson localization is observed at higher densities of the order of those used in the experiments in the 1980s . *",
    "an external magnetic field applied at arbitrary angle with respect to the 2d plane suppresses the metallic behavior and eliminates it completely at @xmath148 .",
    "this is not due to a change in the level of disorder or in carrier density .",
    "the suppression of the metallic behavior appears to be correlated with the degree of spin polarization . * these effects",
    "have been observed in five different electron and hole systems . in some 2d systems ,",
    "the resistivity was found to scale with temperature and/or electric field on both sides of a critical density , and a conductivity - resistivity symmetry was observed around the transition , consistent with a quantum critical point describing the zero temperature metal - insulator transition . at the critical density , the resistivity below some temperature was found to be practically independent of temperature in the best samples .",
    "a central question that must be answered by experiment is whether there is a true metal - insulator transition at @xmath29 and a metallic phase at intermediate densities between @xmath4 and the higher densities where localization is known to prevail .",
    "this will require measurements of many properties other than transport .",
    "for example , tunneling measurements , which yield information about the single - particle density of states , will shed light on whether these are fermi liquids , and whether this is indeed a metal - insulator phase transition .",
    "the magnetization of the system is a central aspect which must be investigated , particularly in light of all the evidence provided by transport measurements that the spins play a very important role ( which they do in some theories ) .",
    "other measurements , which would provide valuable information , are the specific heat , esr , and nmr . given the very small number of electrons contained in a thin 2d layer of material with electron densities @xmath149 to @xmath150 @xmath12 , these will be very difficult experiments to perform .",
    "the main theoretical issue is the description of the 2d electron ( or hole ) system in the neighborhood of the critical density .",
    "should the existence of a metal - insulator transition be unambiguously confirmed experimentally , this will require a theory of the unusual metallic phase .",
    "the experiments already indicate that the metal would not be an ordinary one .",
    "the enormous parallel field magnetoresistance and field - induced shift of the metal - insulator transition are two striking unexpected features .",
    "the nature of the insulating phase and _ its _ large magnetoresistance also need to be understood .",
    "the existence of a true insulator - metal transition at low density implies the possibility of a second metal - insulator transition at higher density to the regime of weak localization .",
    "the understanding of this requires that the theory of the metallic phase cover the range of densities between the two transitions .",
    "various descriptions have been proposed , ranging from the melting of a wigner solid from the insulating side to the formation of one from the metallic side ; from superconductivity to quantum percolation ; from a semi - classical one - electron description with no metal - insulator transition to a non - fermi liquid scenario .",
    "while each of these is capable of explaining one or another part of the set of experimental observations , none of them provides a comprehensive picture .",

    "<S> for about twenty years , it has been the prevailing view that there can be no metallic state or metal - insulator transition in two dimensions in zero magnetic field . in the last several years , however , unusual behavior suggestive of such a transition has been reported in a variety of dilute two - dimensional electron and hole systems . </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind these observations is presently not understood . </S>",
    "<S> we review and discuss the main experimental findings and suggested theoretical models .    2 </S>"
