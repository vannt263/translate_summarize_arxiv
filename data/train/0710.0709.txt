    "string theory is perturbatively reproduced from type iib matrix model @xcite via two dimensional noncommutative ( nc ) @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory @xcite in the ir limit @xcite .",
    "the emergent string theory is green - schwarz ( gs ) type iia superstring theory with light - cone gauge @xcite , which is also derived from commutative @xmath0 super yang - mills @xcite .    in the two dimensional gauge theory",
    ", the ir limit corresponds to the strong coupling limit since the gauge coupling has dimension @xmath1 .",
    "dijkgraaf , verlinde and verlinde have shown that the ir limit corresponds to the free string limit .",
    "this logic is applicable to our case and actually we have derived the free green - schwarz string action from nc gauge theory by taking the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here that the strong coupling limit ( the ir limit ) of nc gauge theory is the free string limit , not the low energy limit of green - schwarz string theory .    the winding number @xmath2 is reinterpreted as a light - cone momentum @xmath3 in a t - dual interpretation . in nc gauge theory , such a duality is realized by identifying the momentum with the longitudinal coordinates . in our procedure ,",

    "the first property is the regularization of uv divergence , which gives rise to the uv / ir mixing effect @xcite .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the correlation functions , such as the power of the momentum dependence , is affected by the existence of noncommutativity .",
    "the second property is the introduction of the scale in the theory .",
    "since there are no scale parameters in the action of iib matrix model , the noncommutativity could provide a fundamental scale in the emergent theory .",
    "we have indeed identified the scale in nc gauge theory with the string scale in the previous paper @xcite . since the nc scale sets the eigenvalue density of the matrices ,",
    "our identification of the string scale is consistent with @xcite .    in order to reveal the perturbative superstring picture in iib matrix model more explicitly ,",
    "it is important to demonstrate the procedure to calculate the superstring scattering amplitude from iib matrix model .",
    "since there is an open / closed duality in string theory , closed string theory will be naturally included in iib matrix model .",
    "the massless sector of type ii closed superstring consists of the supergravity multiplet .",
    "supergravity controls the behavior of long range forces .",
    "the coupling between the fields in the supergravity multiplet and the operators in iib matrix model has been clarified through the construction of the relevant vertex operators .",
    "the vertex operators for the supergravity multiplet are determined uniquely by the maximal @xmath6 supersymmetry transformation in iib matrix model @xcite .",
    "these operators are constructed in @xcite in the first study , where the wave functions are introduced as the representations of supergravity multiplet . in @xcite ,",
    "the vertex operators are investigated further by expanding the supersymmetric wilson loop operators @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the vertex operators are constructed up to the six - th order of majorana - weyl spinor @xmath7 . since the algebraic calculation is very complicated ,",
    "the complete structure of the vertex operators is not yet determined , but the vertex operators for the conjugate gravitino and two - form antisymmetric field are completely determined .    in this paper , we compare the iib matrix model vertex operators on the two dimensional backgrounds with those in superstring .",
    "as we have derived supersymmetry transformation of gs light - cone superstring from iib matrix model on the two dimensional backgrounds @xcite , we can reconstruct the superstring vertex operators based on the symmetry . in such a sense , this comparison can be regarded as a consistency check of the iib matrix model vertex operator construction . through this correspondence , we can reproduce the physical superstring scattering amplitudes from iib matrix model .    in section [ 31 ] , we review the supergravity vertex operators in iib matrix model , which was constructed in @xcite . in section [ 32 ] , we review the closed superstring vertex operator construction of gs light - cone superstring theory . in section [ 33 ] , we review the derivation of gs light - cone superstring action from iib matrix model , which is carried out in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "the derivation of supersymmetry transformation for gs light - cone superstring from iib matrix model is also shown .",
    "the main investigation is carried out in section [ 5 ] where the vertex operators of iib matrix model on the two dimensional nc backgrounds are analyzed .",
    "we verify that these operators are equivalent to superstring vertex operators .",
    "section [ 6 ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
