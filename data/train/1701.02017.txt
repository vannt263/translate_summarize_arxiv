    "binary neutron star ( bns ) mergers are the catastrophic fate of relativistic binary systems formed by a pair of neutron stars ( nss ) . the intense emission of gravitational waves ( gw ) that characterizes the final phases of the inspiral and its expected frequencies of @xmath3-@xmath4 hz make merging bnss one of the primary targets of ground based gw detectors , such as advanced ligo , advanced virgo , and , in the nearby future , kagra .",
    "in addition , these events are expected to inject matter and energy into the interstellar medium , and to produce a rich variety of paramount astrophysical phenomena , including the nucleosynthesis of the heaviest elements , and the emission of characteristic electromagnetic transients from the freshly synthesized radioactive nuclei , and radio flares from the expanding ejecta .",
    "a bns merger is expected to leave behind a compact object surrounded by a hot and dense accretion disk . inside this",
    "remnant , gravitational energy is efficiently converted to internal energy and emitted in the form of neutrinos .",
    "the nature of the central object depends primarily on intrinsic attributes of the merging system ( such as the nss masses and their ratio ) and on the still uncertain properties of hot nuclear matter above nuclear saturation density .",
    "the direct collapse of the merging nss into a black hole ( bh ) is foreseen only for very massive colliding objects , while in most cases the production of a ( possibly metastable ) differentially rotating massive neutron star ( mns ) is expected .",
    "if the mns mass exceeds the maximum allowed ns mass , the mns will collapse to a bh on a characteristic time scale .",
    "the duration of this phase depends sensitively on several parameters and poorly understood processes happening inside the mns . among them",
    ", we recall the amount of angular momentum and its distribution , the effects of thermal support and the consequences of neutrino cooling , the role and the properties of magnetic fields .    the large amount of energy available in these events , together with the short time scale and the reduced volume that characterize the merger and its aftermath , led to the hypothesis that bns mergers represent ( together with the merger of bh - ns binaries ) a plausible progenitor system for short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) at cosmological distances .",
    "observational evidences collected over the last years seem to support this hypothesis . however , a satisfactory and detailed explanation of how the merger of a compact binary system involving at least one ns powers a relativistic jet is still missing and the central engine of short grbs still remains veiled .",
    "several different mechanisms have been suggested . among them , the conversion of energy by magnetohydrodynamical effects in bh - torus systems @xcite , the extraction of magnetic energy from highly magnetized , long - lived mns @xcite , and the annihilation of neutrino - antineutrino pairs in low density regions above the remnant @xcite .",
    "the conditions needed for the formation and collimation of a relativistic jet above a merger remnant , as well as the interactions with the accretion disk , non - relativistic winds and dynamic ejecta , have been recently investigated with increasing details and accuracy @xcite .",
    "neutrino emission from merger remnants has been the topic of several dedicated studies @xcite .",
    "the annihilation of neutrino - antineutrino pairs above bh - torus systems has been extensively studied , also considering the effects of general relativity on the neutrino propagation @xcite .",
    "annihilation rates above mns - disk system have been computed by and . in the former case , several snapshots from the first 100  ms of an axisymmetric merger aftermath simulation were post - processed using both a @xmath5 transport scheme and a simpler gray leakage scheme to model neutrino radiation . in the latter , four snapshots taken from long - term , axisymmetric simulations of merger aftermaths , and covering the 0 - 3 sec interval were post - processed with a monte carlo radiative transfer code and , again , with a simpler gray leakage scheme .    in this work ,",
    "we compute the energy and momentum deposition rates above bns merger remnant over a time scale of 400  ms , comparable with the life time of the disk . we post - process several merger configurations taken from a long - term , three dimensional simulation of the aftermath of a bns merger .",
    "we assume a long - lived mns and specifically investigate the impact of the neutrino emission from the mns .",
    "we also explore the impact of relativistic effects in the neutrino propagation on the annihilation rates , in the presence of a mns .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in connection with the energy inferred from short grb observations , to address the question whether neutrino pair annihilation can be responsible for the production of relativistic jets above bns mergers .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : simulation ] , we present the merger aftermath simulation from which we take the remnant configuration and the neutrino emission properties .",

    "the initial conditions for our model were taken from a high - resolution sph simulation of the merger of two equal mass ( 1.4 @xmath6 ) neutron stars @xcite .",
    "we mapped the remnant configuration at @xmath7  ms after the merger inside our equally spaced cartesian grid . at this time",

    "neutrinos of all flavors were emitted from the remnant with a total luminosity larger than @xmath11 .",
    "the re - absorption of a fraction of the emitted neutrinos inside the disk caused the formation of a neutrino - driven wind on a time scale of a few tens of milliseconds .",
    "at the same time , matter expanded from the disk along the equatorial direction .",
    "this was the beginning of the so - called disk evaporation @xcite .",
    "the wind developed mainly from the disk and the funnel above the central neutron star has a lower density than the material extending in the equatorial direction .",
    "we evolved the system for @xmath12  ms .",

    "we call them `` cooling '' luminosities and rms energies ( dashed lines ) .",
    "neutrino luminosities are powered by the cooling of the remnant and by the process of accretion inside the disk .",
    "after an initial phase ( @xmath38  ms ) when the disk dissipates internal perturbations and transients , and the total luminosity slightly increases , all the luminosities decrease with time .",

    "as reported in , this discrepancy is due to the lack of spatial resolution in our simulation deep inside the mns , where the thermal decoupling of @xmath22 s occurs .    due to the stationary treatment of the mns ,",
    "the luminosities coming from the spheroid @xmath14 , @xmath40 , are practically constant during the simulation . to mimic the decrease produced by the cooling process",

    "finally , we define @xmath134 as the deposited cumulative energy : @xmath135 alongside with a global annihilation efficiency , @xmath136      the hydrodynamics simulation and the annihilation rate calculations presented in the previous sections are performed in a newtonian framework .",
    "however , matter in the disk moves close to keplerian , and typical orbital speeds are given by : @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the msn mass and radius , respectively .",

    "a consistent relativistic calculation requires to start from the results of relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of a neutron star merger , and to compute the annihilation rates in a relativistic framework . due to the newtonian character of our input simulations ,",
    "this is not entirely possible .",
    "however , we can compute the impact of special and general relativistic effects on the neutrino propagation and on the annihilation process using our newtonian input data .",
    "we consider the following effects on the propagation from the emission to the interaction points : the doppler and beaming effects due to the fast motion of the emitting fluid elements , and the redshift and light bending effects due to motion of the radiation in the gravitational potential .",

    "we perform the calculation of the annihilation rates for twenty equally spaced time steps , ranging from 0 to 380  ms .",
    "since the input data are cylindrically symmetric , we expect also @xmath72 and @xmath51 to be axisymmetric .",
    "thus , we compute the rates only on the @xmath147 plane and we assume them to be valid for any polar angle @xmath148 . for the discretization of the @xmath148 angle required by our calculations , we choose @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) and we test the convergence of our results with respect to this parameter ( @xmath151 for @xmath152 ) . to save computing time",
    ", we consider the emission of neutrinos only from cells with @xmath153 .",
    "also in this case , this simplification introduces an error lower , at most , than a few percents .",
    "in figure [ fig : anni rate different timesteps ] , we show the local energy deposition rate @xmath154 at four different times , both for electron flavor ( left panel ) and heavy flavor ( right panel ) neutrino pairs .",
    "these rates have been obtained using our standard ( i.e. , non - relativistic ) approach .",
    "we notice that in both cases and at each time the energy deposition rate is more intense close to the remnant and decreases for increasing distances , as a consequence of the decrease of the neutrino intensity .",
    "moreover , even if the rates decrease with time due to the decline of the neutrino luminosities , their spatial distribution remains qualitatively similar during the evolution of the system .",
    "however , the results obtained for the different flavors differ significantly . in the @xmath25-@xmath21 case ,",
    "the energy deposition is more intense and distributed over a wider volume , including the regions above the mns and the innermost part of the disk . in the @xmath22-@xmath70 case ,",
    "the energy deposition is concentrated above the mns and the decrease of @xmath155 with time is less pronounced , due to the milder reduction of the @xmath22 luminosities .",
    "the deposition rate for the linear momentum is presented in figure  [ fig : anni momentum rate different timesteps ] , again for four different times .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of @xmath156 projected on the vertical plane . due to the axisymmetry of the neutrino emissivities , we expect the azimuthal component of the deposited momentum to be negligible .",
    "the geometry of the mns and of the disk influences the emission direction of the neutrinos and , in turn , the direction of @xmath156 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dessart momentum ] ) .",
    "in particular , the mns produces an almost spherical emission inside the funnel above its surface .",
    "this combines with the axisymmetric emission from the disk .",
    "the latter happens predominantly at the transition between the mns and the disk , where neutrinos are emitted towards the funnel and , on average , perpendicularly to the neutrino surfaces ( see figure [ fig : nu_surfaces ] ) . at larger radii ,",
    "the average emission direction from the disk becomes parallel to the @xmath15 axis or even pointing outwards .",
    "since in the case of @xmath22 the neutrino emission comes mainly from the mns , @xmath157 presents a more radial structure .",
    "we notice that at larger times , when the disk has shrunk its radius and consumed its mass , @xmath158 also develops into a more radial configuration .",
    "a comparison between the energy and momentum deposition reveals that the intensity of the latter tracks the one of the former .",
    "however , the dependence on the colliding angle @xmath159 contained in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dessart ] ) and ( [ eq : dessart momentum ] ) , and the vector sum that characterizes the momentum deposition imply that @xmath160 .",
    "in particular , the more isotropic and symmetric the local neutrino distribution , the less efficient is the momentum deposition compared to the energy one . in figure  [ fig : anni rate momentum ratio different timesteps ] , we present @xmath161 and confirm that close to the msn and to the disk , where the propagation directions are expected to be more isotropic , the ratio is significantly smaller than 1 , reaching even 0.2 , while it increases up to 0.8 at larger distances .",
    "we repeat the pair annihilation calculations including special and general relativistic effects , and we present the results for the local energy deposition rate in figure  [ fig : anni rate with gr different timesteps ] .",
    "the inclusion of the relativistic effects does not change the qualitative features of the energy deposition rate .",
    "a careful comparison between the energy deposition rates provided by @xmath162 pairs shows that the light bending and the gravitational blueshift increase the annihilation rates immediately above the mns ( by @xmath163 ) , while the gravitational redshift , together with the beaming of the radiation emitted by matter rotating inside the disk , reduces the energy deposition rate in the funnel and above the innermost part of the disk .",
    "where the rates are larger , the reduction is usually @xmath164 , but it increases when the distance from the mns and the disk increases , as well as at later times . in the case of @xmath165 pairs ,",
    "the dominant effect is provided by the gravitational redshift and the result is a reduction of the energy deposition rate everywhere in the computational domain . the gain in annihilation efficiency due to the light bending",
    "is attenuated by the dominant contribution of the mns to the @xmath22 luminosities .",
    "the qualitative features of the momentum deposition rate computed by taking into account the relativistic effects in the neutrino propagation are very similar to the ones obtained in our reference newtonian calculations . in figure",
    "[ fig : anni rate momentum ratio with gr different timesteps ] , we present the ratio between the modulus of the momentum and the energy deposition rates .",
    "a comparison with the analogue figure obtained in the newtonian framework , figure [ fig : anni rate momentum ratio different timesteps ] , shows that the light bending reduces the efficiency at which a net momentum is deposited more significantly , with respect to the energy deposition rate , especially close to the mns surface and in the funnel above it .    in figure",
    "[ fig : anni rate integrated ] , we present the volume integrated rates , @xmath126 ( left panel ) and cumulative deposited energy , @xmath134 ( right panel ) , for both the reference newtonian calculations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : q non rel])-([eq : e non rel ] ) , and including relativistic corrections , ( [ eqn : relativisitic local volume integrated energy rate ] ) .",
    "we first notice that , for the volume element in our cylindrical discretization , one has @xmath166 thus , intense deposition regions located at larger cylindrical radii contribute more significantly than close to the rotational axis .",
    "the integration over the volume allows to quantify the difference between the different neutrino flavors : @xmath167 is @xmath39  60 times larger than @xmath168 .",
    "due to this large difference , the contribution of @xmath22 s is significantly sub - dominant for the overall energy deposition process . the approximated expression ( [ eq : simple parametrization ] )",
    "accounts for this considerable disparity . in particular , comparing the electron and the heavy flavors , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the inclusion of relativistic effects in the neutrino propagation changes only marginally the intensity of the energy deposition rate .",
    "in particular , the energy blueshift and light bending happening close to the mns are globally compensated by the redshift and the light beaming in the funnel and above the disk .",
    "overall , the integrated energy deposition measured by local observers differs only by a few percent in the newtonian and in the relativistic case .",
    "the difference becomes more relevant ( @xmath171 ) only when @xmath172 and @xmath173 are considered : this is due to the inclusion of the gravitational redshift required for the deposited energy to travel from the deposition site to infinity .",
    "the volume - integrated energy deposition rate for @xmath25 and @xmath21 ranges between @xmath174 and @xmath175 , with a clear decreasing trend with time . the total amount of energy deposited by neutrino pair annihilations in the funnel above the merger remnant reaches @xmath176  erg at 380  ms in our newtonian calculation , while it reduces to @xmath177  erg in the relativistic calculations when the energy at infinity is considered .",
    "we notice that , even if the deposition rate has significantly decreased at the end of our simulation , this energy has not saturated yet .",
    "this is due to the longer time scales of neutrino diffusion from the mns , @xmath178 , and of disk consumption , @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the role of the mns in the process of neutrino pair annihilation , we decompose the local emissivity @xmath116 into a contribution from the disk ( @xmath180 ) and one from the neutron star ( @xmath181 ) . all neutrinos that originate inside the spheroid @xmath14 are tagged as `` neutron star ( ns ) neutrinos '' , while all the others are identified as `` disk ( ds ) neutrinos '' .",
    "we notice that this distinction refers to the origin place , but not necessarily to the emission place .",
    "while all ds neutrinos are emitted from the disk region , a fraction of the ns neutrinos can diffuse out from the disk before being emitted .",
    "this happens especially for those neutrinos emitted by the mns along the equator .      in the case of an accretion disk around a bh",
    ", the disk luminosity can be related to the accretion rate at the bh horizon , @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is a coefficient that quantifies the efficiency at which the rest mass of the accreting matter is converted into emitted radiation ( typically , @xmath184 , ) . here",
    "we present the behavior of the luminosity and accretion rate based on our simulation and discuss the significant differences due to the presence of a mns .",
    "the distinction between neutrinos coming from the mns and from the disk allows to decompose each neutrino luminosity into a mns and a disk contribution . in figure",
    "[ fig : decomposed neutrino luminosities ] , we show for each independent species the disk and the mns components .",
    "the mns contributions originate mainly from the diffusion of neutrinos from the hot and dense central remnant .",
    "their decrease reflects the progressive cooling of the mns and of the matter accreting on its surface .",
    "the larger disk components are more related to the accretion process and present a more pronounced reduction .",
    "the evolution of the accretion rate inside the disk , @xmath185 is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : accretion rate and luminosity ] . since there is no clear inner boundary where to measure the flux of the infalling matter",
