    "the thomas  fermi ( tf ) equation has proved useful for the treatment of many physical phenomena that include atoms@xcite , molecules@xcite , atoms in strong magnetic fields@xcite , crystals@xcite and dense plasmas@xcite among others .",
    "it is well  known that an accurate solution to that equation is based on the accurate calculation of the slope at origin@xcite .",
    "in particular we mention the rational approximation in terms of pad approximants@xcite because it is relevant to present discussion . as expected from the great physical significance of the tf equation , its mathematical aspects have been studied in detail@xcite .    in spite of being a quite old problem in theoretical physics ,",
    "there has recently been a renewed interest in analytical solutions to the tf equation .",
    "for example , liao@xcite and later khan and xu@xcite proposed the application of the so called homotopy analysis method ( ham ) .",
    "more recently parand and shahini@xcite showed that a pseudospectral method based on chebyshev polynomials is more accurate than ham .",
    "unfortunately , parand and shahini@xcite were not aware that we had earlier shown that the well  known straightforward pad approximants are much more accurate than ham@xcite .",
    "therefore , they compared their pseudospectral results with the rather insufficiently accurate ham ones that do not constitute a suitable benchmark .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first we compare the results of the simple and straightforward hankel  pad method ( hpm)@xcite with the supposedly accurate chebyshev pseudospectral ones@xcite .",
    "second , we show that the hpm also gives accurate results for the tf equation for atoms in strong magnetic fields that has not been treated before in this way .    in section  [ sec : tfeq ]",
    "we briefly introduce the tf equations for both problems and show how to transform them into more tractable differential equations . in section  [ sec : hpm ] we outline the main ideas behind the hpm , apply it to both tf equations , and compare hpm and chebyshev pseudospectral results for isolated atoms . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main results and comment on other approaches to nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "the dimensionless form of the tf equation for atoms@xcite @xmath0 is an example of two  point nonlinear boundary  value problem .",
    "when solving this ordinary differential equation one faces the calculation of the slope at origin @xmath1 that is consistent with the physical boundary conditions indicated in equation ( [ eq : tf ] ) .    in order to make this letter self contained we review the main features of the hpm@xcite",
    "it is convenient to define the variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 , so that the tf equation becomes @xmath4 -f(t)f^{\\prime } ( t)-2t^{2}f(t)^{3}=0   \\label{eq : tfb}\\ ] ] we expand the solution @xmath5 in a taylor series about @xmath6 : @xmath7 where the coefficients @xmath8 depend on the only unknown one @xmath9 .",
    "on substituting the series ( [ eq : f_series ] ) into equation ( [ eq : tfb ] ) we easily calculate as many coefficients @xmath8 as desired ; for example , the first ones are @xmath10    the tf equation for atoms in strong magnetic fields is somewhat simpler@xcite @xmath11 by means of the same change of variables we obtain @xmath4 -f(t)f^{\\prime } ( t)-2t^{4}f(t)=0   \\label{eq : tf2b}\\ ] ] as well as the solution in the form of the taylor series ( [ eq : f_series ] ) with coefficients @xmath12 where @xmath13 as in the preceding case .",
    "the hpm is based on the transformation of the power series ( [ eq : f_series ] ) into a rational function or pad approximant @xmath14(t)=\\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^{m}a_{j}t^{j}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n}b_{j}t^{j } } \\label{eq:[m / n]}\\ ] ] one would expect that @xmath15 in order to have the correct limit at infinity ; however , in order to obtain an accurate value of @xmath16 it is more convenient to choose @xmath17 , @xmath18 as in previous applications of the approach to the schrdinger equation ( in this case it was called riccati  pad method ( rpm))@xcite .",
    "the rational function ( [ eq:[m / n ] ] ) has @xmath19 coefficients that we may choose so that @xmath20,t)=\\mathcal{o}(t^{2n+d+1})$ ] , where @xmath21 stands for either equation ( [ eq : tfb ] ) or ( [ eq : tf2b ] ) , and in both cases the coefficient @xmath16 remains undetermined . if we require that @xmath20,t)=\\mathcal{o}(t^{2n+d+2})$ ] we have another equation from which we obtain @xmath22 .",
    "however , it is simpler and more practical to proceed in a different ( and entirely equivalent ) way and require that @xmath14(t)-\\sum_{j=0}^{2n+d+1}f_{j}t^{j}=\\mathcal{o}(t^{2n+d+2 } ) \\label{eq:[m / n]2}\\ ] ] in order to satisfy this condition it is necessary that the hankel determinant vanishes @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dimension of the hankel matrix .",
    "each hankel determinant is a polynomial function of @xmath16 and we expect that there is a sequence of roots @xmath25}$ ] , @xmath26 that converges towards the actual value of @xmath27 for a given value of @xmath28 .",
    "we compare sequences with different values of @xmath28 for inner consistency ( all of them should give the same limit ) .",
    "present approach is simple and straightforward : we just obtain the taylor coefficients @xmath8 from the differential equations ( [ eq : tfb ] ) or ( [ eq : tf2b ] ) in terms of @xmath16 , construct the hankel determinant , and calculate its roots . since @xmath29 is the first nonzero coefficient that depends on @xmath16 we choose hankel sequences with @xmath30 .",
    "the hankel determinant @xmath31 exhibits many roots and their number increases with @xmath32 .",
    "if we compare the roots of @xmath31 with those of @xmath33 we easily identify the sequence @xmath25}$ ] that converges towards @xmath27 .",
    "present hpm may be considered to be a systematic generalization of tu s approach@xcite and is clearly different from the strategy proposed by epele et al@xcite .",
    "we stress that we have been using the hankel condicion  ( [ eq : hankel ] ) for quite a long time@xcite .",
    "we first consider the tf equation for atoms .",
    "the convergence of the hpm has already been discussed in our earlier paper@xcite ; therefore , here we simply compare our results with those of parand and shahini@xcite .",
    "our estimate of @xmath1 @xmath34 is by far more accurate than the one obtained by parand and shahini@xcite @xmath35 , liao@xcite @xmath36 and khan and xu@xcite @xmath37 .",
    "notice that all those authors kept several inaccurate digits in their results .",
    "this practice is misleading because it suggests that the calculations are more accurate than what they really are .",
    "table  [ tab : u(x ) ] shows our earlier results@xcite , those of parand and shahini@xcite and the numerical calculation of kobayashi et al@xcite .",
    "those hpm results obtained from a relatively small @xmath38 $ ] pad approximant are more accurate than the numerical ones for @xmath39 .",
    "we appreciate that the simple and straightforward pad approximants are far more accurate than the more elaborated pseudospectral approach@xcite .",
    "notice that also in this case parand and shahini@xcite kept several misleading inaccurate digits .",
    "[ fig : logconv2 ] shows @xmath40}-2f_{2}^{[d-1,d]}\\right| $ ] for @xmath41 that provides a reasonable indication of the convergence of the sequence of roots for the tf equations for atoms in strong magnetic fields .",
    "we clearly appreciate the great convergence rate of the sequences with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( the rate of convergence for the case @xmath44 is slightly smaller but still suitable for practical applications ) . from those sequences we estimate @xmath45 that is exact to the last digit and considerably more accurate than the results published earlier@xcite .",
    "in this letter we have shown that the well  known simple and straightforward pad approximants provide much more accurate results for the tf equation than the more elaborated chebyshev pseudospectral method@xcite , exactly as we did earlier with the rather cumbersome ham@xcite .",
    "we also applied the hpm to the tf equation for an atom in a strong magnetic field , analyzed the convergence of the hankel sequences towards the slope at origin , and obtained its value with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the tf equation is an example of two  point boundary value problems that are most important in theoretical physics .",
    "we have already applied the hpm to other such problems@xcite .",
    "there are alternative approaches for the accurate treatment of two  point boundary value problems . here",
    "we mention the work of boisseau et al@xcite , bervillier et al@xcite , and in particular a recent comprehensive discussion of power  series methods for ordinary differential equations@xcite .",
