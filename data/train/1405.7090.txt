    "generally , the superconducting order parameter depends on two coordinates and two spin indices , @xmath0 .",
    "a classification of possible superconducting phases in crystalline materials was given in refs .   and .",
    "the majority of crystalline superconductors with low transition temperatures have a singlet order parameter with an s - wave orbital symmetry that does not change under rotation of the coordinates . in the simplest case",
    ", @xmath1 depends significantly only on a single coordinate , where @xmath2 is the second pauli matrix in spin space , @xmath3 is a complex valued function and the superscript @xmath4 indicates that is has s - wave symmetry . however , over the last decades a number of superconductors have been discovered in which the order parameter transforms according to a non - trivial representation of the point group of the underlying crystal .",
    "although such superconductors are quite common by now , following the terminology of ref .  , we refer to them as being `` unconventional . ''",
    "important examples include the high temperature cuprate superconductors which have a singlet d - wave symmetry@xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 changes sign under coordinate rotation by @xmath7 .",
    "the best known example of a p - wave superfluid is superfluid @xmath8 .",
    "one of the leading candidates for p - wave pairing in electronic systems is sr@xmath9ruo@xmath10.@xcite there are numerous pieces of experimental evidence that the superconducting state of sr@xmath9ruo@xmath10 has odd parity , breaks time reversal symmetry and is spin triplet.@xcite an order parameter consistent with these experiments is given by the chiral p - wave state @xcite which has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fourier transform of @xmath13 .",
    "anderson s theorem accounts for the fact that superconductivity in s - wave superconductors is destroyed only when the disorder is so strong that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the fermi momentum and @xmath16 is the electronic elastic mean free path .",
    "however , since in unconventional superconductors @xmath12 depends on the direction of the relative momentum @xmath17 of electrons in the cooper pair , they are much more sensitive to disorder ; even at temperature @xmath18 , unconventional superconductivity is destroyed when @xmath16 is comparable to the zero temperature coherence length , @xmath19 , in the pure superconductor , @xmath20 .",
    "the fate of unconventional superconductivity subject to increasing disorder depends on the sign of the interaction constant in the s - wave channel .",
    "it is straightforward to see that if the interaction in the s - wave channel is attractive , but weaker than the attraction in an unconventional channel , then as a function of increasing disorder , there will first be a transition from the unconventional to an s - wave phase when @xmath21 , followed by a transition to a non - superconducting phase when @xmath22 .    in this article",
    "we consider the more interesting and realistic case , in which the interaction in the s - channel is repulsive . in this case , we show that there is necessarily a range of disorder strength in which , although locally the pairing remains unconventional , the system has a global s - wave symmetry with respect to any macroscopic superconducting interference experiments",
    ". therefore there must be at least two phase transitions as a function of increasing disorder : a d - wave ( or p - wave ) to s - wave , followed by an s - wave to normal metal transition .",
    "qualitatively the phase diagram of disordered unconventional superconductors is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_diagram ] ( an incomplete derivation of these results  only for the d - wave case  was obtained in refs .   and .",
    ")    the existence of the intermediate s - wave superconducting phase between the unconventional superconductor and the normal metal ( and of the associated s - wave to unconventional superconductor transition ) can be understood at a mean field level which neglects both classical and quantum fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "the electron mean free path is an average characteristic of disorder .",
    "let us introduce a local value of the mean free path @xmath23 averaged over regions with a size of order @xmath24 . when the disorder is sufficiently strong such that , on average , @xmath25 , the superconducting order parameter will only be large in the rare regions which satisfies @xmath26 .",
    "in this case , the system can be visualized as a matrix of superconducting islands that are coupled through josephson links in a non - superconducting metal .",
    "( the superconductivity inside an island can also be enhanced if the pairing interaction is stronger than average , _",
    "i.e. _ if the local value of @xmath19 is anomalously small . ) at sufficiently large values of disorder",
    "the distance between the islands is larger than both their size and the mean free path .",
    "below we show that in the vicinity of the superconductor - normal metal transition , the superconducting phase may be described by the mattis model .      to begin with , we consider the mean - field description of an isolated superconducting island .",
    "the order parameter in an individual island is written as @xmath27 where hat indicates the two by two matrix structure in spin space and we label individual islands with latin indices @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . generally , as a consequence of the random disorder , neither",
    "the shape of the island , nor the texture of pairing tendencies within it have any particular symmetry , so the resulting gap function @xmath31 mixes the symmetries of different bulk phases .",
    "since there is no translational symmetry , it is convenient to define @xmath32 as the fourier transform of @xmath27 with respect to the relative coordinate @xmath33 and to use @xmath34 as the center of mass coordinate .",
    "( since all of the coordinates to appear from now on will be the center of mass coordinates , we will henceforth drop the tilde . ) in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , a sharp distinction exists between spin-0 ( singlet ) and spin-1 ( triplet ) pairing , although even that distinction is entirely lost in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the most general form of the gap function ( with a phase convention which we will specify later ) expressed as a second rank spinor in terms of pauli matrices is @xmath35 where we have left implicit the @xmath36 and @xmath37 dependence of the scalar @xmath38 and vector @xmath39 quantities that represent the singlet and triplet components of the order parameter .",
    "the energy of a single grain is independent of the overall phase of the order parameter @xmath40 . in the absence of spin - orbit interaction",
    "it is also independent of the direction @xmath39 .",
    "an additional discrete degeneracy may be associated with time - reversal invariance of the problem .",
    "the latter implies that the state described by a time - reversed order parameter @xmath41^ *          i\\hat\\sigma_2\\ ] ] leads to the same energy of the grain . in the absence of spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry",
    "the time reversal operation leads to the same physical state @xmath42 , otherwise the time - reversed state is physically different .",
    "it is important to note that generally ( at the present mean - field level ) time reversal symmetry is violated in droplets of unconventional superconductors of a random shape .",
    "this occurs even in the case when the bulk phase of the unconventional superconductor is time reversal invariant , such as d - wave superconductors or the @xmath43 and @xmath44 phases realized in strained sr@xmath9ruo@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "for example , d - wave superconducting droplets of a random shape embedded into a bulk metal can have , with non - vanishing probability , a local geometry analogous to that of a corner squid experiment @xcite in which two sides of a droplet with different signs of the order parameter are connected by a metallic josephson link with an effective negative critical current .",
    "an equilibrium current will thus flow , provided the critical current of the  negative link \" is large enough .",
    "we will characterize the degeneracy with respect to time reversal by a pseudo - spin index @xmath46 . in this case",
    "it is convenient to introduce a pseudospin @xmath47 in each grain that will distinguish the two time - reversed states , @xmath48 and write the general expression for the order parameter in each grain as @xmath49 where we explicitly separate the u(1 ) phase of the order parameter .",
    "electrons propagating in non - superconducting metals experience andreev reflection  @xcite from the superconducting islands .",
    "this induces josephson coupling between the islands .",
    "so long as the separation between islands is large , the spatial dependence of the order parameter within each grain @xmath50 , will not be affected .",
    "therefore the low energy hamiltonian of the system may be expressed in terms of the phases @xmath40 only .",
    "the energy of this coupling can be expressed in the form @xmath51\\ ] ] here @xmath52 is the josephson coupling energy between the islands @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath53 is the phase which is determined by the spatial dependence of the complex order parameter in the grains , @xmath50 ( which in turn still depends on which state , @xmath46 , is involved ) .    our goal is to show that in the limit in which the distance between the islands is sufficiently large compared to their size then the link phases may be written as @xmath54 eqs .",

    "this situation applies , for example , near the point of a quantum superconductor - metal transition , where the typical distance between the superconducting grains is larger than their size , which is of order the zero temperature coherence length .",

    "in the presence of disorder , even in the case where the clean bulk phase is a pure @xmath68-wave superconductor , the order parameter in each grain will contain an @xmath4-wave component @xmath69 where upper script in the parenthesis stands for the orbital symmetry whereas @xmath70 indicates the ising variable which specifies which of the two time - reversed versions of the gap function is being considered . substituting eq .",

    "( [ eq : z_ss ] ) leads to a logarithmic divergence of the ground state energy .",
    "however , multiple andreev reflections  @xcite of diffusing electrons from the grains provide a cutoff of this divergence at large distances.@xcite since the cutoff length is greater than the typical distance between the grains our results are not affected by the presence of this cutoff .     in eq .",

    "for example for a spherical fermi surface in which @xmath84 ( with @xmath85 ) we have @xmath86    it is important to note that @xmath87 and @xmath88 fall off faster with the distance between the grains than @xmath89 .",

    "( [ eq : z_ss ] ) has a phase factor that can be written as a sum of phase factors of individual grains which are independent of the direction of the link @xmath90 .",

    "( [ eq : theta_mattis ] ) in which the phases @xmath103 and @xmath104 depend only on the grain properties but not on the direction of the link connecting them , @xmath105 .",

    "( [ eq : z_ss ] ) , which again leads us to the mattis model , eqs .",

    "( [ eq : josenmattred ] ) . in this limit",
    ", the random phases of the josephson couplings between islands can be gauged away ; as can seen from the construction that leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : josenmattred ] ) , the ordered state corresponds to uniform - phase ( ferromagnetic ) ordering of the s - wave components from grain to grain , even when the largest component of the order parameter on each grain is unconventional .",
    "thus , at long distances the system behaves as an s - wave superconductor with respect to all superconducting interference experiments .",
    "for example , corner squid experiments @xcite will not exhibit trapped fluxes . in the case",
    "where in the absence of disorder there is a @xmath109 state , where the disorder is nearly strong enough to quench the superconductivity , there will be no edge currents , and in the presence of an external magnetic field , the long distance ( topological ) vortex structure will be that of a conventional s - wave superconductor .",
    "corrections to the mattis model come from the coupling between the non - s - wave components of the order parameter , and are thus smaller than the leading contributions to @xmath110 in proportion to a positive power of @xmath111 .",
    "however , even when @xmath108 is large , these corrections can be qualitatively significant : since the @xmath4-@xmath4 contribution to @xmath112 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_ss ] ) is independent of the pseudo - spin variables @xmath70 and @xmath113 , to leading order in @xmath111 the energy of the system is @xmath114-fold degenerate , where @xmath115 is the number of grains .",
    "the leading correction to the josephson coupling energies have the form of either eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_sd ] ) or ( [ eq : z_pp ] ) . in the presence of these corrections ,",
    "the energy depends on the configuration of the pseudo - spins and there is a level of frustration which can not be removed ( as in the mattis model ) by a gauge transformation . specifically ,",
    "although in the expression for the josephson energy , @xmath116 , @xmath117 are small , @xmath118 they reflect intrinsic frustration in the couplings since the sum of the phases around a typical closed loop , @xmath119 , is generally non - zero .",
    "moreover , both @xmath120 and @xmath121 depend on @xmath47 and @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , one generic consequence of the corrections to the mattis model is that they lift the energy degeneracy of the system with respect to the pseudo - spin variables @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , one expects the subsystem of pseudo - spins to form a glassy state .",
    "another consequence of the corrections is that they result in the existence of equilibrium currents . in the three dimensional case",
    ", the existence of the corrections to the mattis model does not destroy the long range superconducting order characterized by the phase @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , results from the mattis model concerning the long - range s - wave - like nature of the superconducting state are robust to these corrections . in two spatial dimensions the correction terms necessarily eliminate long range phase coherence , since the correlation function of the phases in the ground state diverges logarithmically at large distances .",
    "however , as long as @xmath123 , the length at which the phase changes by a number of order unity is exponentially large in comparison to the intergrain distance .    at intermediate strength of disorder , when @xmath108 gets to be comparable to the size of the superconducting islands , the effective energy of the system , eq .",
