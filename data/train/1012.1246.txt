    "since @xcite and @xcite , the dynamics of dust grains has been investigated in many papers and its analysis is an inseparable part of astrophysics . the influence of the electromagnetic radiation of a central star is usually taken into account in the form of the poynting - robertson ( p - r ) effect ( @xcite ) . beside the p - r effect , the stellar wind ( corpuscular radiation of the star ) can also affect the motion of dust particles .",
    "covariant derivation of the acceleration caused by the stellar wind and its effects on the dynamics of dust grains were presented in @xcite .",
    "the solar magnetic field can affect the motion of charged dust particles in the solar system ( @xcite ) .",
    "planets can capture the dust particles into the mean - motion resonances ( @xcite ) . because of the relative motion of the sun with respect to the local interstellar medium , atoms of the interstellar medium approach the sun .",
    "the direction of the approach is given by the actual velocity of the sun with respect to the local interstellar medium .",
    "these approaching atoms form an interstellar gas flow .",
    "this flow of interstellar atoms through the solar system has been already investigated in the past ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this interstellar gas flow can affect the dynamics of dust grains in outer parts of the solar system .",
    "the assumption that dust particles in orbits around other stars can be also affected by interstellar gas flow is supported by the recent detection of debris disks around stars with asymmetric morphology caused by a fast motion of the disk through a cloud of interstellar matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the influence of interstellar gas flow on the dynamics of a spherical dust particle was investigated by @xcite , who calculated the secular time derivatives of the particle s angular momentum and the laplace - runge - lenz vector caused by the interstellar gas flow .",
    "he has come to the conclusion that the particle s semi - major axis can increase exponentially ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result contradicts results of @xcite . here",
    "the secular time derivatives of the keplerian orbital elements of the dust particle under the action of a fast interstellar gas flow were for the first time calculated for arbitrary orientations of the orbit .",
    "@xcite states that the secular semi - major axis of the dust particle must decrease under the action of the interstellar gas flow .",
    "the rate of decrease is proportional to the semi - major axis .",
    "decrease of the semi - major axis only happens in secular time - scales .",
    "therefore , the exact calculation of the secular time derivative of the semi - major axis was necessary .",
    "this result was confirmed also by @xcite who investigated the motion of a dust particle in the outer region of the solar system behind the solar wind termination shock .",
    "they calculated the orbital evolution of the dust particle under the action of a constant mono - directional force , i.e. , they solved a case of the classical stark problem ( for more information about the stark problem see @xcite and the references therein ) . in the stark problem",
    "it is assumed that the orbital speed of the dust grain with respect to a central object can be neglected in comparison with the speed of the interstellar gas flow .",
    "the relative velocity terms are in @xcite taken into account to the first order of accuracy in the calculation of the secular time derivatives of keplerian orbital elements .",
    "@xcite reproduced the result of @xcite on the secular evolution of the semi - major axis of the particle s orbit .",
    "however , the case of a mono - directional force ( i.e. , the stark problem ) can be important for those stars where the relative speed of the neutral gas with respect to the central star is high .",
    "such a situation can occur , for example , in merging galaxies when a star from the first galaxy moves through a molecular cloud of the second galaxy .",
    "@xcite used the orbit - averaged hamiltonian method .",
    "in this paper we use a method based on orbit - averaged time derivatives of keplerian orbital elements . using this different method",
    "we confirm results of @xcite .",
    "we not only use a new method , we also find new results .",
    "we find an explicit form for the time dependence of all keplerian orbital elements determined with respect to a reference plane perpendicular to the gas flow velocity vector .",
    "mainly the time dependence of the longitude of the ascending node will represent a generalization of @xcite results .",
    "we find a transformation for the orbital elements determined with respect to the reference plane perpendicular to the gas flow velocity vector into an arbitrarily oriented reference plane .",
    "we determine the maximal and minimal values of eccentricity for numerous special cases .",
    "we study in detail the behaviour of the solution for the planar case and for the case when the gas flow velocity vector is perpendicular to the line of apsides .",
    "properties of the solution in the solar system are discussed .",
    "in order to find the acceleration of a spherical dust particle caused by an interstellar gas flow we will assume ( a ) that the dimensions of the dust particle are small in comparison with the mean free path of the interstellar gas atoms , ( b ) that the mass of the dust particle is large in comparison with the mass of the interstellar gas atoms , and ( c ) that the molecules are specularly or diffusely reflected from the surface of the dust particle .",
    "these assumptions lead to the following acceleration ( @xcite ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the velocity of the dust grain in the stationary frame , @xmath6 is the constant velocity vector of atoms in the flow in the stationary frame , @xmath7 is the drag coefficient , and @xmath8 is the collision parameter . for the collision parameter we can write @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of the neutral hydrogen atom , @xmath11 is the concentration of the interstellar neutral hydrogen atoms , and @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 is the geometrical cross section of a spherical dust grain of radius @xmath15 and mass @xmath16 .",
    "assumption ( a ) is a reasonable approximation to conditions in interstellar space .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ floweqom ] ) is valid for all dust particles with dimensions for which assumption ( b ) holds .    in order to find the final equation of motion",
    "we further assume ( d ) that the dust particle orbits around a star .",
    "therefore we take into account also the electromagnetic radiation of the star in the form of the p - r effect .",
    "the equation of motion then has the form @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\ & &    - ~c_{d } ~\\gamma_{h } ~ \\vert \\vec{v } - \\vec{v}_{h } \\vert ~\\left ( \\vec{v } - \\vec{v}_{h } \\right ) ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 @xmath13 @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the gravitational constant , @xmath20 is the mass of the star , @xmath21 is the position vector of the particle with respect to the star , @xmath22 @xmath13 @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath13 @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "parameter @xmath27 is defined as the ratio of the electromagnetic radiation pressure force and the gravitational force between the star and the particle at rest with respect to the star @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the star luminosity , @xmath30 is the dimensionless efficiency factor for radiation pressure integrated over the star spectrum and calculated for the radial direction ( @xmath30 @xmath13 1 for a perfectly absorbing sphere ) , and @xmath31 is the mass density of the particle .",
    "the second term represents the p - r effect neglecting terms of higher orders in @xmath32 than the first ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ ceqom ] was used in numerical experiments by @xcite .",
    "we also restrict the possible speeds of the interstellar gas flow .",
    "we will assume ( e ) that the speed of the interstellar gas flow is much greater that the mean thermal speed of the gas in the flow .",
    "for interstellar gas flow speeds @xmath33",
    "@xmath13 @xmath34 comparable to the mean thermal speed of the gas @xmath35 is a function of @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath35 has an approximately constant value for those interstellar gas flow speeds much greater that the mean thermal speed of the gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume ( f ) that the speed of the interstellar gas flow is much greater than the speed of the dust grain in the stationary frame associated with the central star .",
    "finally , we assume ( g ) that the secular time derivatives of the semi - major axis and the eccentricity of the particle s orbit caused by the p - r effect during orbital evolution are low in comparison with the values of the semi - major axis and the eccentricity , respectively .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for grains with large semi - major axes and small eccentricities ( @xcite ) .",
    "these particles have small orbital speeds .",
    "therefore , in the p - r effect , the terms depending on velocity can be neglected in comparison with the keplerian term .",
    "assumptions ( a)(g ) lead to the final equation of motion @xmath36 if the radial stellar wind is also considered in eq .",
    "( [ ceqom ] ) , then eq . ( [ fineqom ] )",
    "remain unchanged ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , assumptions ( f ) and ( g ) require radial distances that are probably larger than the radial distance to the stellar wind termination shock for the majority of sun - like stars .",
    "we want to find the influence of the constant acceleration given by the second term in eq .",
    "( [ fineqom ] ) on the secular evolution of a particle s orbit .",
    "we will assume ( h ) that constant acceleration can be considered as a perturbation acceleration to the central acceleration caused by the gravity of the central star .",

    "we denote the components of the hydrogen gas velocity vector in the stationary cartesian frame associated with the central star as @xmath6 @xmath13 @xmath37 . in order to compute the secular time derivatives of the keplerian orbital elements ( @xmath38 , the semi - major axis ; @xmath39 , the eccentricity ; @xmath40 , the argument of the pericentre ; @xmath41 , the longitude of the ascending node ; @xmath42 , the inclination ) we want to use the gauss perturbation equations of celestial mechanics . to do this , we need to know the radial , transversal , and normal components of acceleration given by the second term in eq .",
