    "nonequilibrium properties of many - particle systems have traditionally been described by kinetic equations of the boltzmann type . despite their fundamental character",
    ", these equations have well - known principal shortcomings , e.g. ( i ) the short - time behavior ( @xmath0 - the correlation time ) can not be described correctly , ( ii ) the kinetic or the quasiparticle energy is conserved instead of the total ( sum of kinetic and potential ) energy , ( iii ) no bound states are contained , and ( iv ) in the long - time limit , they yield the equilibrium distribution and thermodynamics of ideal particles .    an important generalization are the well - known kadanoff ",
    "baym equations derived by kadanoff and baym @xcite , and keldysh @xcite .",
    "however , the original kbe contain no contribution from initial correlations .",
    "therefore , the kbe are unable to describe the initial stage of the evolution ( @xmath1 ) and the influence of initial correlations which can be important for ultrafast relaxation processes .",
    "to include initial correlations into the kbe , various methods have been used , including analytical continuation of the equilibrium kbe to real times @xcite and perturbation theory with initial correlations @xcite .",
    "a convincing solution has been presented by danielewicz @xcite , who developed a perturbation theory for a general initial state and derived generalized kbe which take into account arbitrary initial correlations .",
    "finally , a straightforward and very intuitive method which does not make use of perturbation theory but uses the equations of motion for the green s functions instead , has been developed in @xcite . while perturbative approaches are restricted to situations where the coupling is weak , our method is valid for arbitrary coupling strength . in particular",
    ", it allows to consider systems with strong coupling , such as coulomb systems at low temperatures and/or high density ( e.g. metals and dense plasmas ) and nuclear matter , and to include bound states . in sec .",
