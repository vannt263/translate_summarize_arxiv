    "the large - scale integral - sign warps of the outer regions of spiral galaxies has been a long - standing theoretical puzzle .",
    "the strongest warps are observed in the hi disks when these extend well beyond the optical disks ( briggs 1990 ) .",
    "the warps are antisymmetric and consequently can be well - fitted by the kinematic tilted - ring model of rogstad , lockhart , and wright ( 1974 ) . for a set of 12 galaxies with high - quality data on the extended hi disks , briggs ( 1990 ) found empirically a set of ` rules of behavior ' of warps : 1 .",
    "the warps develop with increasing radius @xmath8 for @xmath8 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( the holmberg radius , @xmath11 ) , where the subscript denotes the surface brightness in @xmath12 in mag / arcsec@xmath13 ; 2 .",
    "the line - of - nodes of the warp is straight for @xmath14 ; and 3 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the line - of - nodes forms an open leading spiral .",
    "an illustrative case is shown in figure 1 which gives a surface plot of the warp of the disk of the spiral galaxy m 83 obtained from the data of briggs ( 1990 ) .",
    "the rotation of m 83 is clockwise so that the warp is a _ leading _ spiral wave .",
    "figure 2 also shows the data of briggs ( 1990 ) for m 83 , in panel ( * a * ) the radial ( @xmath8 ) dependence of the tilt angle @xmath16 , in ( * b * ) the @xmath8-dependence of the angle of the line - of - nodes @xmath17 , and in ( * c * ) the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath17 , which we refer to as a briggs plot .",
    "a different behavior is observed for the galaxy ngc 3718 which shows an approximately straight line - of - nodes out to @xmath18 and a large tilt angle ( @xmath19 ) at this radius ( briggs 1990 ) .",
    "a partial listing of the theoretical works on warps of disk galaxies include kahn and woltjer ( 1959 ) , hunter and toomre ( 1969 ; hereafter ht ) , toomre ( 1983 ) , sparke and casertano ( 1988 ) , binney 1992 , hunter ( 1994 ) , merritt and sellwood ( 1994 ) , and nelson and tremaine ( 1995 ) . since the pioneering analysis by hunter and toomre ( 1969 ) and the earlier related work by lynden - bell ( 1965 ) ,",
    "the theoretical studies have focused mainly on determining the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies of warped self - gravitating disks .",
    "the studies used the ht dynamical equation for the vertical displacement of the disk surface @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "in contrast with these earlier works , the present study investigates different initial value problems of a warped disk in an oblate ( or prolate ) halo potential , and it develops a different representation for the disk warping .",
    "instead of describing the disk in terms of @xmath20 , we develop a representation in terms of @xmath0 independently tilted , self - gravitating , concentric rings which is suggested by the kinematic ring model of rogstad et al .",
    "may and james ( 1984 ) mention a model of this kind , but they give no details . we show that the @xmath1ring representation is equivalent to the ht equation for @xmath20 for @xmath22 .",
    "however , new insight is given by the @xmath1ring model : a new constant of the motion for a warped disk is found .",
    "the notion of the phase - locking of the line - of - nodes of nearby rings due to self - gravity is demonstrated .",
    "we propose that this explains briggs s rule no .",

    "in the case of a prolate halo with @xmath116 instability is possible .    in order to understand the stability of the ring tilting ,",

    "solution of equation ( 17 ) including @xmath184 gives @xmath185 thus , both fast and slow precession modes with @xmath186 are stable in the presence of friction , whereas the slow precession mode with @xmath187 is unstable @xmath188 $ ] .",

    "thus , for the slow precession mode , @xmath193 is negative if @xmath194 , and the tilt angle grows .",
    "the instability is therefore a _ negative energy dissipative _ instability .",
    "an analogous instability was predicted and observed for the precession of laboratory collisionless relativistic electron rings ( furth 1965 ; beal et al .",
    "the instability also occurs in the presence of a non - newtonian ( nonlinear ) friction force on the ring .",

    "the full calculation of this drag ( nelson and tremaine 1995 ) is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "instead , we include a linear drag torque in the equation of motion for @xmath234 which we estimate following the approach of weinberg ( 1985 ) .",
    "inclusion of this term shows that dissipation can destabilize the ring tilting in a prolate halo potential .",
    "the instability is of the negative energy type ; that is , it occurs only for @xmath662 .",

    "is appropriately measured by the coupling strength @xmath411 of equation ( 48 ) . as @xmath411 increases the ring motion changes from that of independent precession for @xmath665 to phase - locked precession for @xmath666 where the lines - of - nodes coincide approximately , @xmath667 .",
    "this phase - locking persists for the case of @xmath668 rings .",
    "we examine the influence of dissipative forces on the tilting motion of two rings .",
    "in addition to dynamical friction , which is included as linear drag torques on each ring , we include the ` relative ' friction which can result from the differential vertical motions of two gaseous rings due to turbulent viscosity .",
    "the corresponding drag torques on each ring have a definite form owing to the requirement that the total angular momentum of the two rings be conserved in the absence of external torques .",
    "the turbulent viscosity is assumed to be described by the @xmath433 model of shakura ( 1973 ) and shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "we find that the relative friction , as well as the dynamical friction , can destabilize the motion of two rings in a prolate halo potential .",
    "we study the case of two tilted rings which rotate in opposite directions .",

    "we comment on the numerical solutions for @xmath7 for different values of @xmath0 , and we give a sample power spectrum for @xmath495 which shows the distribution of the @xmath496 mode frequencies .",
    "we argue that for treatment of intial value problems of time duration @xmath673 , mode frequency differences @xmath502 smaller than @xmath503 are irrelevant .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath674 for the number of rings needed to treat warps in galactic disks .    in the continuum limit @xmath22 ,",
    "the ring model is shown to give the hunter and toomre ( 1969 ) dynamical equation for the vertical displacement of the disk @xmath20 .",
    "dissipative torques due to dynamical friction and/or relative friction ( for gaseous rings ) are shown to cause the energy of the warp @xmath647 to decrease with time .",
    "we have numerically solved the dynamical equations for @xmath7 for @xmath495 for four different types of initial conditions which may give rise to observed warps in galaxies : ( 1 ) warp excitation by a passing satellite with relatively large impact parameter ; ( 2 ) excitation by a slowly sinking compact minor satellite ; ( 3 ) warp evolution in a tilted halo potential ( dekel and shlosman 1983 ; and toomre 1983 ) ; and ( 4 ) warp evolution resulting from an initially tilted disk plane due to the tidal breakup of a gas cloud .",
    "the nature of the disk response at different times is most clearly shown in the polar plots of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 which we refer to as briggs plots .",
    "this is one of the forms used by briggs ( 1990 ) to describe the warp geometry as deduced by fitting a kinematic ring model ( rogstad et al .",
    "1974 ) to hi observations .",
    "for case ( 1 ) we find that the polar plots @xmath675 have the shape of a leading spiral wave qualitatively of the form observed , but the warp amplitude @xmath3 is smaller than observed in many galaxies .",
    "the small warp amplitudes found here are in agreement with the conclusions of ht .",
    "the leading spiral in the @xmath675 curves in the outer part of the disk ( where the self - gravity between the rings is small ) results from the dominance of the slow precession mode which gives very roughly @xmath676 , where @xmath381 is the single ring slow precession frequency .",
    "the fast precession modes disappear in a few gyrs due to phase - mixing .    for case",
    "( 2 ) of a sinking satellite , we find that the @xmath675 curves have a large noise component and are unlike the observed curves in the absence of relative friction between the rings .",
    "this is due to the violent excitation from the satellite passing through the disk .",
    "however , with relative friction included , the @xmath675 curves are smooth leading spiral waves qualitatively similar in shape to the observed curves .",
    "the warp amplitude , although significantly larger than for case ( 1 ) , is still smaller than that for many observed warps .",
    "we find that the inner part of the disk where @xmath3 is small has an approximately straight line - of - nodes ( @xmath4 independent of @xmath529 ) for both cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as observed by briggs ( 1990 ) ( his ` rule of behavior ' no .",
    "we show that this is due to the above - mentioned phase - locking of the lines - of - nodes of the inner rings of the disk due to self gravity between the rings .    for case",
    "( 3 ) of an oblate halo potential rigidly tilted with respect to the inner disk of the galaxy , there is a unique time independent laplacian warp @xmath677 ( bt , p. 413 ) which has a straight line - of - nodes ( @xmath678 const . ) .",
    "however , it is unlikely that a galactic hi disk is ` set up ' with the laplacian tilt .",
