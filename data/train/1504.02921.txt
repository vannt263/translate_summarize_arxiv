    "increasing the capacity of a wireless communication system has always been a focus of the wireless communications research community .",
    "it is well - known that polarisation diversity can be exploited to mitigate the multipath effect to maintain a reliable communication link with an acceptable quality of service ( qos ) , where a pair of antennas with orthogonal polaristion directions is employed at both the transmitter and the receiver sides .",
    "however , the traditional diversity scheme aims to achieve a single reliable channel link between the transmitter and the receiver , while the same information is transmitted at the same frequency but with different polarisations , i.e. two channels .",
    "this is not an effective use of the precious spectrum resources as the two channels could be used to transmit different data streams simultaneously .",
    "for example , we can design a four - dimensional ( 4-d ) modulation scheme across the two polarisation diversity channels using a quaternion - valued representation , as proposed in @xcite",
    ". an earlier version of quaternion - valued 4-d modulation scheme based on two different frequencies was proposed in @xcite . however , due to the change of polarisation of the transmitted radio frequency signals during the complicated propagation process including multipath , reflection , refraction , etc , interference will be caused to each other at the two differently polarised receiving antennas . to solve the problem ,",
    "efficient signal processing methods and algorithms for channel equalisation and interference suppression / beamforming are needed for practical implementation of the proposed 4-d modulation scheme .",
    "recently , quaternion - valued signal processing has been introduced and studied in details to solve problems related to three or four - dimensional signals @xcite , such as vector - sensor array signal processing  @xcite , and wind profile prediction  @xcite .",
    "with most recent developments in this area , especially the derivation of quaternion - valued gradient operators and the quaternion - valued least mean square ( qlms ) algorithm @xcite , we are now ready to effectively solve the 4-d equalisation and interference suppression / beamforming problem associated with the proposed 4-d modulation scheme .",
    "now the dual - channel effect on the transmitted signal can be modelled by a quaternion - valued iir / fir filter . at the receiver side , for channel equalisation , we can employ a quaternion - valued adaptive algorithm to recover the original 4-d signal , which inherently also performs an interference suppression operation to separate the original two 2-d signals .",
    "moreover , multiple antenna pairs can be employed at the receiver side to perform the traditional beamforming task to suppress other interfering signals .",
    "note although quaternion - valued wireless communication employing multiple antennas has been studied before , such as the design of orthogonal space - time - polarization block code in @xcite , to our best knowledge , it is the first time to study the quaternion - valued equalisation and interference suppression / beamforming problem in this context .    in the following , the 4-d modulation scheme based on two orthogonally polarised antennas will be introduced in sec .

    "in traditional polarisation diversity scheme , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : trantennapair ] , each side is equipped with two antennas with orthogonal polarisation directions and the signal being transmitted is two - dimensional , i.e. complex - valued with one real part and one imaginary part . in the quaternion - valued modulation scheme , the signal is modulated across the two antennas to generate a 4-d modulated signal .",
    "such a signal can be conveniently represented mathematically by a quaternion @xcite .",
    "a quaternion is a hypercomplex number defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the real part of the quaternion , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the three imaginary components with their corresponding imaginary units @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . as an example , corresponding to the 4-qam ( quadrature amplitude modulation ) in the two - dimensional case , for the 4-d modulation scheme , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 can take values of either @xmath8 or @xmath9 , representing @xmath10 different symbols .",
    "we can call this scheme 16-qqam ( quaternion - valued qam ) or 16-@xmath11 .",
    "the signal transmitted by the two antennas will go through the channel with all kinds of effects and arrive at the receiver side , where the two antennas with orthogonal polarisation directions ( note the orthogonal polarisation may not give the best performance ) will pick up the two signals . again",
    "the four components of the received signal can be represented by another quaternion .",
    "we use @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] to represent the transmitted and received 4-d quaternion - valued signals , respectively .",
    "then the channel effect can be modeled by a filter with quaternion - valued impulse response @xmath14 $ ] , i.e. @xmath15=s_t[n]*f_{c}[n]+q_a[n]\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] is the quaternion - valued additive noise , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : channelmodel ] .        to recover @xmath12 $ ] from @xmath13 $ ] or estimate the channel , as in the 2-d case ( complex - valued ) , we can design a quaternion - valued equaliser .",

    "now assume we have a reference signal @xmath17 $ ] available , then we can employ the standard adaptive filter structure shown in the second half of fig .",
