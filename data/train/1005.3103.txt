    "the result is in marked contrast with @xcite , in which significant offsets between the center of the dark halo component and that of g1 have been reported based on modeling of quasar images a  d .",
    "such large offset is no longer allowed because of additional constraints from multiply imaged galaxies , time delays , and central images .",
    "the best - fit center of the dark halo component is also consistent with the x - ray center reported by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit position angle of @xmath125  deg for the dark halo component is quite consistent with the position angle of g1 , and also that of the member galaxy distributions studied in @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : mproj ] compares the projected two - dimensional mass profiles from gravitational lensing and x - ray measurements .",
    "we confirm that the profiles agree quite well with each other , including radial slopes of the profiles .",
    "the agreement suggests that the effect of the halo triaxiality , which affects the apparent two - dimensional lensing masses particularly near the center of the cluster ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , is not significant .",
    "however , it should be noted that the best - fit halo mass of @xmath142 and the concentration of @xmath143 are quite different from those inferred from x - ray , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "one reason for this the strong degeneracy between @xmath146 and @xmath147 inherent to strong lens mass modeling .",
    "basically strong lenses constrain the central core mass of the cluster , which is a strong function of both @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the determination of @xmath146 and @xmath147 solely from strong lensing relies on the extrapolation of the subtle change of the radial slope out to much larger radii .",
    "the robust determination of these parameters from lensing therefore requires addition constraints from weak gravitational lensing .",
    "( 85mm,85mm)figure4.eps      now we allow the inner slope of the dark halo component @xmath19 to vary to see how well the current strong lens data , including time delays which are quite helpful to break degeneracy in mass models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , can constrain the inner density profile . specifically , for each fixed value of @xmath19 we optimize the other parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : gnfw_alpha ] shows the @xmath108 difference as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "we find that our mass modeling is quite consistent with the nfw profile , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "we constrain the range of the slope to @xmath148 at 95% confidence limit .",
    "the profile as steep as @xmath149 is clearly rejected .",
    "there is a clear correlation between @xmath19 and the velocity dispersion of galaxy g1 such that the best - fit velocity dispersion decreases with increasing @xmath19 , which approximately conserves the central core mass of the total matter distribution .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : xray ] , the _ chandra _ x - ray observation suggests that the lensing cluster may have larger value of the concentration parameter than the best - fit nfw model predicts .",
    "we include this effect by adding a prior of @xmath150 to the mass model to see how the constraint on @xmath19 is modified .",
    "the result shown in figure  [ fig : gnfw_alpha ] indicates that the constraint is basically shifted to the lower @xmath19 , i.e. , shallower inner density slope .",
    "the resulting range is @xmath151 at 95% confidence limit .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gnfw_alpha ] , we also show the total magnification factor for the five quasar images , @xmath152 , and the time delay between the quasar images a and d , @xmath153 , predicted by the best - fit model for each fixed @xmath19 .",
    "we find that @xmath154 is decreasing and @xmath153 is increasing with increasing @xmath19 , which are consistent with well - known dependence of the magnification and time delay on the radial density slope ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus the reported lower limit of @xmath122  days @xcite prefers a steeper inner slope ( larger @xmath19 ) , which appears to be opposed to the effect of the prior from x - ray discussed above . in either case , the strong dependence of @xmath155 on @xmath19 implies that additional a  d time delay measurements will greatly help to constrain the mass model further .",
    "we have revisited parametric mass modeling of sdss  j1004 + 4112 , a unique quasar  cluster lens system , using a newly developed mass modeling software .",
    "we include several new constraints , including positions of spectroscopically confirmed multiply imaged galaxies , time delays between some quasar images , and faint central images .",
    "our model comprising of a halo component modeled by the generalized nfw profile , member galaxies including the brightest cluster galaxy g1 , and perturbation terms , well successfully reproduced all observations including time delays .    unlike earlier claims based on parametric mass modeling",
    ", we have found that the center and orientation of the dark halo component is in good agreement with those of member galaxies and _ chandra _ x - ray observation , implying that the cluster is highly relaxed .",
    "the radial profile from strong lensing is also in excellent agreement with the mass profile inferred from the x - ray observation .",
    "our mass modeling prefers the dark halo component with the inner slope close to @xmath21 , being consistent with so - called nfw density profile .",
    "additional measurement of the time delay between quasar image a and d will be useful to constrain the mass model further .",
    "the predicted total magnification of @xmath119 for the nfw profile is quite large compared with those for typical galaxy - scale lenses , because of the shallower density profiles for clusters .",
    "this makes the lens system a good site for studying the fine structure of the quasar through microlensing ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or for studying host galaxies of distant quasars @xcite .",
    "we note that our result based on parametric mass modeling is broadly consistent with recent non - parametric mass modeling by e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our result suggests that the core of the lensing cluster at @xmath0 is highly evolved .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the cluster macsj1423.8 + 2404 at @xmath156 is similarly highly relaxed based on the comparison of mass , light , and gas distributions .",
    "therefore our result may point to the fact that relaxed clusters are quite common already at @xmath157 .",
    "it is clear that the lensing cluster sdss  j1004 + 4112 is currently one of the best - studied high - redshift clusters whose inner density profile is very tightly constrained by strong lensing .",
    "additional constraints on this cluster with weak lensing , sunyaev - zeldovich effect , and spectroscopic identifications of member galaxies will be important to advance our understanding of high - redshift clusters .",
    "i would like to thank the referee , marceau limousin , for useful comments and suggestion .",
    "we have developed a comprehensive software package called _ glafic _ that can be used for a wide variety of analysis for gravitational lensing .",
    "its features include efficient computations of lensed images for both point and extended sources , handling of multiple sources , a wide range of lens potentials , and the implementation of noble technique for mass modeling .",

    "strong lens modeling with the standard @xmath108 minimization is sometimes time - consuming , especially when many lens potential components and images are involved .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to evaluate @xmath108 in the source plane instead of the image plane .",
    "although the source plane @xmath108 involves approximations ( given that observational measurements are always made in the image plane ) and therefore is less accurate than the image plane @xmath108 , it allows one to estimate @xmath108 without solving the nonlinear lens equation .",
    "this technique has been adopted by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although the implementations were quite different for different papers .",

    "assuming @xmath160 and @xmath170 are close with each other , we can write @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the source position computed from the observed @xmath163-th image position : @xmath173 and @xmath167 is estimated at @xmath174",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : c2_pos ] ) becomes @xmath175 similarly , the magnification and time delay are approximated as @xmath176 @xmath177 in the code , @xmath178 is evaluated numerically .",
    "inserting these expressions into equations ( [ eq : c2_flux ] ) and ( [ eq : c2_dt ] ) yield @xmath179 and @xmath180 , respectively .",

    "they found a clear correlation between @xmath197 and @xmath198 , but with different values .",
    "this is because they did not take account of the full magnification tensor ( eq . [ [ eq : magtensor ] ] ) but simply adopted a magnification factor to approximate @xmath108 , as has been often done in the literature .",
    "thus our result highlights the quantitative importance of the proper approximation taking the full lens mapping into account ."

    "<S> we present a strong lens analysis of sdss  j1004 + 4112 , a unique quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies at @xmath0 , using a newly developed software for gravitational lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our parametric mass model well reproduces all observations including the positions of quasar images as well as those of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts , time delays between quasar images , and the positions of faint central images . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted large total magnification of @xmath1 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the dark halo component is found to be unimodal centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the _ chandra _ x - ray surface brightness profile . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution , implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system . </S>",
    "<S> the radial profile of the best - fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the x - ray observation . </S>",
    "<S> while the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being @xmath2 , a clear dependence of the predicted a  d time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model . </S>"
