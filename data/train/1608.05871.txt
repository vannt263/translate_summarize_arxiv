    "nanostructured materials offer unprecedented opportunities for thermal management and energy conversion by enabling a wider range as well as better control of the thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "interfaces are central to their performance since they are scattering centers for heat carriers whose spatial distribution can be set during fabrication and whose dispersion strength can be controlled by tailoring their physical properties @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the full potential of this revolution is still to be seen because there is a gap between our fundamental understanding of heat flow across single and multiple interfaces and the outcome of experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "for instance , while many simulations predict an enhancement of thermal conductance when a thin layer is inserted at a well bonded interface @xcite , only one experiment backs up that prediction so far @xcite .",
    "other experiments reporting conductance enhancement attribute the increase to a strengthening of the bonds at the boundaries @xcite .",
    "thermal interface engineering can be critical to many technologies like integrated circuits @xcite , phase change memory @xcite or high power electronics @xcite .",
    "a systematic and microscopic understanding of the bridging properties of an interfacial layer would go a long way towards that goal .    adding an intermediate layer to a well - bonded interface can enhance the conductance in two different ways . in the harmonic limit , the layer could act as an impedance matching waveguide ( fig .",
    "[ fig_intro]a ) that reduces phonon reflection by destructive interference , similar to an antireflection coating @xcite .",
    "such a complete quenching of reflection occurs at a single frequency where the layer thickness can function as a quarter wave plate . in the anharmonic regime on the other hand",
    ", the layer can act as a bridge that facilitates frequency up and down conversion and increases the chances of phonons crossing the interface @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig_intro]b ) .",
    "the contribution of each individual effect to the total enhancement has not been systematically explored on the same material system . neither is there a clear criterion to choose the properties of the layer to maximize the conductance . in a 1d harmonic crystal for instance ,",
    "we have established that a conductance maximum occurs when the impedance of the layer is the geometric mean of the contact impedances @xcite , even in presence of incoherent interface scattering .",
    "this thumb - rule persists for all lengths except the extreme limit of a single atom , where the mean generates a resonance that lies beyond the cut - off frequency and the system is forced to choose an arithmetic mean instead . however",
    ", this result has not been extended to multiple dimensions and crystal structures .",
    "a similar gap exists when phonon - phonon interactions are included , where it was proposed that the maximum conductance happens when the layer s density of states ( dos ) maximizes its overlap with the contact doss .",
    "this argument leads to two different criteria to obtain the maximum : 1 ) choose the atomic mass of the layer close to the arithmetic mean of the contact masses @xcite and 2 ) choose the debye temperature of the layer as the geometric mean of the contact debye temperatures @xcite .",
    "this unresolved discrepancy once again reveals our lack of understanding of the role played by the inserted layer for a real multidimensional physical system with complex modes , symmetries , and scattering events .    in this paper",
    "we compare the enhancement of conductance in the harmonic and anharmonic limits and demonstrate the dominant role of anharmonicity ( sec .",
    "[ secharvsanh ] ) .",
    "we show that adding an intermediate layer can go either way by increasing or decreasing the conductance when phonon transport is restricted to the harmonic regime ( sec .",
    "[ secharmonic ] ) . in this limit , the conservation of energy and momentum constrain the number of available transport channels , so the increase in average transmission per channel must compete with the loss in the number of transport channels . when anharmonicity is added ( sec .",
    "[ secanharmonic ] ) , phonon - phonon interaction relaxes the conservation constraints and decouples the boundaries .",
    "maximizing the conductance becomes equivalent to minimizing the sum of individual boundary resistances . for our particular system , where only mass changes are considered , we show that the maximum happens when the layer mass is close to the geometric mean of the contact masses . as explained earlier , this result would be expected for 1-d coherent phonon transport at a single frequency .",
    "the surprise however is that the geometric mean ends up winning even for a 3-d crystal with broad - band phonon transport across modes and polarizations , including anharmonic and diffusive interactions .",
    "we can hypothesize that a bridging layer can in fact be a matching layer if we compositionally grade it so each slice has an acoustic impedance that is the geometric mean of its immediate nearest neighbors .",
    "the tendency of the geometric mean to favor the lower impedance of the pair mathematically translates to an exponentially varying spatially dependent impedance , with an exponent set by the logarithm ratio of the two impedances at either end of the layer .",
    "interface thermal conductance or thermal boundary conductance is defined as the ratio between the heat flux crossing an interface over the temperature drop across it , @xmath1 . within the landauer formalism",
    ", the conductance between two contacts at thermal equilibrium can be expressed as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cross sectional area , @xmath4 is the phonon energy , @xmath5 is the bose - einstein distribution , @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath7 is the number of available propagating channels , which we call modes , and @xmath8 is the average transmission per mode . in a bulk material , each mode is a 1d subband generated by a particular polarization and a transverse wavevector , which gives rise to a quantum of conductance @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath9 represents the sum of all the possible transmissions between the modes on the left and right contacts .",
    "this factor can be calculated using non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the retarded green s function describing the propagation of phonon waves in the channel , and @xmath12 the broadening matrix for the left ( l ) and right ( r ) contacts @xcite . to compare the conductance from landauer formalism with that from non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd )",
    ", we need to take the classical limit of the bose - einstein distribution ( eq .  [ equgq ] with @xmath13 ) and we need to subtract the contact resistance ( appendix  [ app_cr ] and fig .",

    "this value should be the limit of the nemd conductance as temperature tends to zero .",
    "figure  [ fig_g_har_vs_anh ] plots the harmonic and anharmonic thermal conductances @xmath14 across interfaces with an added intermediate bridging layer or junction , belonging to a face centered cubic ( fcc ) crystal structure in one case and diamond cubic ( dc ) in the other .",
    "the boundaries between adjacent materials are assumed to be perfectly abrupt and the thickness of the junction is taken to be @xmath15 conventional unit cells . for each system , we vary the atomic mass of the junction @xmath16 in between the contact atomic masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the crystal structure , lattice constant @xmath19 and interatomic force constants are invariant along the system , so we can isolate the effect of a change in atomic mass .",
    "some consequences of relaxing these assumptions are discussed at the end of each of the following sections .",
    "the conductance in the harmonic regime is calculated from landauer formalism in the classical limit using negf to obtain @xmath9 , while the conductance in the anharmonic regime is calculated from nemd .",
    "note that we report the conductance measured from the left to the right material including the contribution from the junction .",

[ fig_g_har_vs_anh]b and [ fig_g_har_vs_anh]d ) .",
    "this result is a consequence of the boundary resistance being an increasing function of the mass ratio of the materials at either side of the boundary ( sec .",
    "[ secanharmonic ] ) .",
    "therefore , the sum of the boundary resistances is minimum when the ratio of the masses is equal ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "notably , this is a much more general result than an antireflection coating , which requires in addition a quarter wave plate to not just minimize but completely eliminate the sum of the boundary resistances through destructive interference , that only works at a single frequency for a homogeneous layer material .",
    "when phonons transit without interacting with each other , adding an intermediate layer does not necessarily increase the interfacial conductance ( fig .",
    "[ fig_g_har_vs_anh]c ) . to understand this result , we start by rewriting eq .  [ equgq ] to highlight the role of phonon transmission vs. number of transport channels on the interfacial conductance .",
    "@xmath0 is related to the factor @xmath9 , which represents the sum over all the possible phonon transmissions between modes of the left contact , junction and right contact .",
    "due to the perfectly abrupt nature of the boundaries , the system is periodic in the transverse direction , so that successful transmissions must conserve the transverse wavevector ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "this assumption allows us to consider only transmissions involving propagating channels of the junction .    the relative enhancement in the conductance of a bridged ( superscript @xmath21 ) interface compared to that of an abrupt ( superscript @xmath3 ) interface depends on the interplay between increasing the transmission and decreasing the conserving modes .",
    "figure  [ fig_interfacewithadesionlayer ] compares the relative change in conductance , conserving modes and transmission using @xmath48 \\left[\\frac{\\langle t^b_c\\rangle_\\omega}{\\langle t^a_{c}\\rangle_\\omega}\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath49 for the abrupt interface defined analogous to eq .",
    "[ equmc ] , but the minimum is taken only over the contact modes . for the fcc crystal ( fig .",
    "[ fig_interfacewithadesionlayer]a ) , the increase in transmission is enough to counter balance the decrease in modes .",
    "however , for the dc crystal ( fig .",
    "[ fig_interfacewithadesionlayer]b ) , the decrease in modes dominates and pushes the conductance of the bridged interface below that of the abrupt interface .",
    "the interplay between transmission and modes is a competition between increasing the value of individual transmitting channels vs. decreasing the number of them .     due to decreasing the `` mismatch '' at each boundary and decreasing the number of conserving modes ( due to a new restriction on the conservation of momentum coming from the intermediate material.,width=325 ]    we can design an intermediate bridging layer at an abrupt interface to improve the impedance matching and increase",
    "the mode averaged transmission ; however , it is important to note that an added layer always decreases the number of modes available for transport .",
    "this is a consequence of the need to conserve phonon energy and transverse momentum in three materials instead of two , which implies taking the minimum over three quantities instead of two ( eq .",
    "[ equmc ] ) .",

    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig_materialmodes]b shows a reduction of the conserving modes of the bridged interface relative to those of the abrupt interface around @xmath51 and @xmath52 rad /s . note that at low frequencies , the acoustic branches of the lightest material dominate the conserving modes and @xmath53 .",

    "however , when the transverse symmetry assumption is relaxed , for example when the lattice constants are not the same or when there are random defects or interatomic mixing at the interface , phonons can change their momentum when they cross the interface .",
    "therefore , the conserving modes do not represent anymore the available transport channels or modes across the interface . the number of transport channels is intimately related to the properties of the individual boundaries between adjacent materials , like the degree of interatomic mixing . in that case ,",
    "conservation of energy allows us to define an upper bound for @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath58 which can be used as a measure of the number of transport channels .",
    "similar to the conserving modes , the minimum of the modes always decreases when a junction is added to an abrupt interface , because we are taking the minimum of three quantities instead of two ( fig .",

    "for instance , the combinations of materials that maximize @xmath37 or @xmath59 should be more amenable to increases in interfacial conductance .",
    "when phonons interact with each other during transport across the junction , for instance through anharmonic terms in the channel potential , they change their energy and momentum .",
    "this process relaxes the conservation constraints in the harmonic limit and decouples the system resistance as the sum of boundary resistances plus a junction resistance @xmath60 figs .",
    "[ fig_g_har_vs_anh]b and [ fig_g_har_vs_anh]d suggest that the maximum conductance , or minimum resistance , happens when the junction mass is close to the geometric mean of the contact masses .",

    "the key element behind the result was that each boundary resistance is an increasing function of the impedance ratio of the materials at either side of the boundary .",
    "thus , minimizing the sum of resistances requires equating the impedance ratios ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "inspired by this result , it is tempting to suggest that @xmath0 is a function of the mass ratio alone .",

    "the fair agreement of this curve with the results from nemd simulations ( figs .",
    "[ fig_g_har_vs_anh]b and d ) suggests that the knowledge of the harmonic boundary conductance is enough to approximate the junction mass that maximizes the conductance . nevertheless , one of the reasons behind the discrepancy is the flattening of the curve around the peak ( figs .",

    "since @xmath122 , there can not be any resistance associated with the flow of phonons inside the device .",

    "this resistance arises from the implicit scattering processes that have to happen at the contacts , to bring the flowing phonons back to an equilibrium distribution @xcite .",
    "the diffusive nature of those scattering processes allows us to split the resistance associated with the maximum conductance into the sum of the resistances at the contacts . since for a homogeneous material",
    "those resistances should be equal , we can define the contact conductance in the classical limit as @xmath123 with @xmath124 the cut off frequency of the material and @xmath125    the conductance from landauer theory @xmath126 is the parallel of the device conductance @xmath127 with the contact conductances @xmath128 and @xmath11 , so the device conductance is given by @xmath129 combining @xmath130 with eq .",

    "when @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_deltagmaxvst_lj]b ) , we can estimate the contact resistances , which are related to the temperature drops at the edges of the heat baths . at the contacts or heat baths , every time step the velocities of the atoms are rescaled to a thermalized distribution , which emulates phonon - phonon scattering processes bringing the region back to equilibrium . everywhere else",
    ", phonons do not interact because the low temperature makes the system harmonic .",
