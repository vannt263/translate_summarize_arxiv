    "cilia and flagella are hair - like appendages of eukaryotic cells exhibiting regular , wave - like oscillations @xcite .",
    "their ability to generate regular beat patterns plays an important role in many systems where motion on a cellular level is required @xcite .",
    "examples range from the propulsion of single cells , such as the swimming of sperm , to the transport of fluid along ciliated surfaces , such as the flow of mucus in the trachea .",
    "ciliary and flagellar beat patterns are generated by an active structure called the axoneme which consists of nine microtubule doublets arranged in a cylindrical geometry @xcite .",
    "a large number of dynein motor proteins are arranged between adjacent microtubule doublets and generate internal stresses within the axoneme that induce relative filament sliding and as a consequence axonemal bending @xcite .",
    "axonemal beat patterns have been the subject of several theoretical analyses trying to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the generation of regular beat patterns @xcite .",
    "recent evidence suggests that the interplay of collectively operating motors together with the elastic microtubules constitutes a mechanical feedback that leads to oscillating instabilities @xcite . the resulting traveling wave bending patterns can account for the experimentally observed beat patterns in bull sperm @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we discuss the properties of self - organized beating patterns , extending previous work in which the linearly unstable modes near an oscillatory instability were studied @xcite .",
    "we present a nonlinear wave equation that describes the fundamental fourier mode of planar axonemal beat patterns and derive analytically how the nonlinearities determine the amplitude of the beat beyond the bifurcation point .",
    "furthermore , we present numerical solutions of the nonlinear wave equation subject to three different boundary conditions .",
    "motivated by the observation that the flagellar beat patterns of many sperm are approximately planar we discuss the dynamics of the axoneme in a plane .",
    "such planar beat patterns can be described by an effective , two - dimensional description of the three - dimensional axonemal structure , in which the axoneme is represented by two elastic rods separated by a fixed distance @xmath0 , corresponding to the axonemal diameter of 185 nm @xcite .",
    "these rods are linked by elastic structural elements and by active force generators , corresponding to the dynein motor proteins . to describe the relative motion of the two rods , we introduce the local sliding displacement @xmath1 and the local shear force density @xmath2 exerted by passive elastic and active elements , as illustrated in figure [ fig : 2d axonemal projection ] .     and the local sliding displacement @xmath3 .",

    "the shape at a given time is described by the local tangent angle @xmath10 as a function of the arc length @xmath5 along the flagellum . ]    in this two - dimensional geometry , the local sliding displacement and the local tangent angle are then related by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the relative sliding displacement at the base @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore hydrodynamic interactions and describe the local hydrodynamic friction by introducing drag coefficients per unit length @xmath13 and @xmath14 for movements in directions parallel and perpendicular to the axonemal axis , respectively .",
    "the dynamics of the axoneme with a bending rigidity @xmath15 and an internal shear force density @xmath16 is then described by the following set of coupled nonlinear equations @xcite @xmath17 where the primes denote derivatives with respect to the arc length @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath18 . the lateral tension @xmath19 ensures that the filament satisfies the local inextensibility constraint @xmath20 .",
    "note that these equations can be derived from a full three - dimensional dynamic description of the axonemal cylinder , restricted to deformations in a plane and do not require the introduction of the effective , two - dimensional axoneme shown in figure [ fig : 2d axonemal projection ] .",
    "the dynamic equations ( [ eq : psi time dependent nl dynamics])([eq : tau time dependent nl dynamics ] ) are complemented by boundary conditions . while the distal end ( @xmath21 ) is typically free to move without external constraints , the basal end ( @xmath22 ) is subjected to external forces and torques . matching the internal and external torques and forces at the ends determines the boundary conditions for the tangent angle @xmath8 and the tension @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "different experimental conditions imply different boundary conditions at the basal end @xmath22 .",
    "motivated by experiments in which the centre of the sperm head is held at a fixed position but potentially free to pivot @xcite , we describe the dynamics of the head angle @xmath23 by introducing an angular elastic modulus @xmath24 and an angular friction coefficient @xmath25 .",
