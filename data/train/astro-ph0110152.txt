    "the transmitted fluxes of high redshift qsos ly@xmath1 absorption spectra have been successfully applied to many aspects of cosmic large - scale structure study , such as the discrimination among dark matter models ( bi , ge & fang 1995 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ) , recovery of the initial linear mass power spectrum and estimation of cosmological parameters ( croft et al .",
    "1998 & 1999 ; hui 1999 ; nusser & haehnelt 1999 ; mcdonald & miralda - escud 1999 ; feng & fang 2000 ; mcdonald et al 2000 ) , and finding the applicable range of the hierarchical clustering model ( feng , pando & fang 2001 ; zhan , jamkhedkar & fang 2001 ) .",
    "these studies show that ly@xmath1 forests provide an important complement to structure formation studies based on galaxy samples .    in this paper",
    "we extend the application of ly@xmath1 forests to the cosmic velocity field . in terms of cosmological parameter determination",
    ", the @xmath0 bulk velocity is an important statistic , as it is related to an integrated power spectrum over the scales beyond the directly detectable range of the power spectrum with current galaxy surveys . on such scales ,",
    "the cosmic clustering remains in the linear regime , and , therefore , would be useful to set a constraint on cosmological parameters , and on the relation between the galaxy distribution and the underlying mass field .",
    "many efforts have been made on measuring and estimating cosmic bulk velocity with galaxy samples .",
    "an important result is that the velocity field calculated from spatial distribution of galaxies is found to be basically consistent with the peculiar velocities measured based on the tully - fisher or fundamental plane relations ( e.g. dekel et al 1999 ; branchini et al 1999 ) .",
    "this indicates that the bulk velocity of galaxies on large scale is of gravitational origin .",
    "that is , the cosmic velocity field @xmath8 on large scales is related to the cosmic mass density field @xmath9 via the following linear relation or its variants @xmath10 where @xmath11 for the local universe .",
    "we define @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the coordinates on the celestial sphere , and @xmath15 is the radial or redshift direction .",
    "a problem with galaxy samples , however , arises from the likely bias of the distributions of galaxies relative to the underlying mass distribution in the universe .",
    "the simplest bias model assumes that the number density fluctuations of galaxies , @xmath16 , is related to the underlying mass density field by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bias parameter .",
    "more sophisticated models assume that the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath9 might be stochastic , non - local , and non - linear .",
    "furthermore , the peculiar velocities of galaxies may also be biased from the cosmic velocity field .",
    "these effects will cause uncertainty in deriving the cosmic velocity field from galaxy samples .",
    "it is therefore important to develop a method of estimating the cosmic velocity field free from galaxy bias .",
    "here we calculate , based on eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the large - scale @xmath0 bulk velocities from samples of the transmitted flux @xmath20 of qso s ly@xmath1 absorption spectrum .",
    "the qso ly@xmath1 forest is very well modeled by absorption from diffusely distributed and photoionized igm , which in turn is believed to be distributed proportionally to the density of the underlying mass field @xmath21 on scales larger than the jeans length of the igm ( for a review , see rauch 1998 ) .",
    "the transmitted flux of qso s ly@xmath1 forest is thus likely to be less biased as a tracer of the underlying mass and velocity field , providing an independent estimate of the @xmath0 bulk velocity , separate from that defined by galaxies .",
    "to do so , we need to develop methods for : 1 ) obtaining mass fluctuation data @xmath9 from ly@xmath1 flux @xmath20 in qso spectra , in the linear or quasi - linear regimes .",
    "2 ) properly calculating the bulk velocity from mass fluctuations .",
    "these two methods are discussed , respectively , in  2 and  3 .",
    "the results of our investigation of the @xmath0 bulk velocity on large scales at high redshifts are presented in  4 .",
    "for a qso with coordinate @xmath22 on the celestial sphere , the observed flux of ly@xmath1 absorptions is equal to @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the continuum , and @xmath25 the optical depth .",
    "the data to be used have been normalized , and therefore the transmission @xmath26 .    for a",
    "diffusely distributed hi cloud in photoionization equilibrium , we have ( e.g. bi 1993 ; fang et al . 1993 ) @xmath27^a v[w(z)-r - v_r(x_i , y_i , r ) , b]\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the redshift space coordinate , @xmath15 is the radial comoving coordinate , @xmath29 is the normalized voigt profile that is approximately gaussian , @xmath30 ^ 2/b^2\\}$ ] , @xmath31 is the radial component of peculiar velocity , @xmath18 is the doppler broadening on the order of several tens km s@xmath3 , and @xmath32/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] is the dark matter density contrast smoothed on the scale of the igm jeans length ( e.g. bi & davidsen 1997 ; nusser & haehnelt 1999 ) . the parameter @xmath33 , which depends on the cosmic baryonic density , the photoionization rate of hi , and the mean temperature of igm , is referred to the mean transmission over a redshift range as @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 depends on reionization , and is in the range of 1.5 to 1.9 ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "there are two problems in drawing information of linear or quasi - linear density fluctuations @xmath36 from the transmitted flux @xmath20 .",
    "first , the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath36 is non - linear .",
    "this is especially true for a saturated absorption line , i.e. @xmath37 corresponds to the non - linear regime of @xmath36 .",
    "second , the peculiar velocity @xmath38 , which is what we are trying to detect , already enters in eq.(2 ) .",
    "these two problems can be avoided by considering the smoothed @xmath20 and @xmath36 on large scales .",
    "if the smoothing scales are much larger than the doppler factor @xmath18 and the positional uncertainty caused by the peculiar velocity @xmath39 , the voigt function @xmath29 can be approximated as a dirac delta function @xmath40 . in this case , eq.(2 ) yields @xmath41^a \\}.\\ ] ] for simplicity , in eq.(3 ) and hereafter we still use the notations @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the smoothed transmission and density perturbations .",
    "thus , for the linear or quasi - linear regime , i.e. , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , eq.(3 ) gives @xmath46 where @xmath47 is to remind that it is for the @xmath48-th qso .",
    "eq.(4 ) shows that the fluctuations of the ly@xmath1 transmission flux @xmath49 trace the underlying density perturbation @xmath50 point - by - point .",
    "the factor @xmath51 plays the role of a bias parameter between the ly@xmath1 flux fluctuations and the mass density perturbations .",
    "@xmath51 is of order of 1 , as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "eq.(3 ) has been used in the recovery of the initial linear power spectrum of the underlying mass field by the observed ly@xmath1 transmission ( e.g. croft et al .",
    "it should be reminded that eq.(4 ) holds only if 1 ) the variance of @xmath54 is less than 1 , or the variance of @xmath20 is less than @xmath55 ; and 2 ) the positional uncertainty caused by the peculiar velocity is much smaller than the scales considered .",
    "we will check the validity of these conditions in the analysis below .      to do the smoothing of the transmitted fluxes , we apply the algorithm of multiscale - decomposition based on the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) ( daubechies 1992 ; fang & thews 1998 ) . because the bases of the dwt analysis are orthogonal , complete and localized , it is easy for the calculation to use eq.(1 ) (",
    "next section ) . in our calculation",
    ", we use the daubechies 4 ( d4 ) wavelets .",
    "let us consider a sample @xmath49 that spans a redshift space @xmath56 , and the spectrum is binned into @xmath57 pixels with @xmath58 being an integer . with the dwt analysis ,",
    "the smoothed @xmath49 on the scale @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61s are the dwt scaling functions for mode @xmath62 .",
    "the label @xmath63 is for spatial scale @xmath59 , and @xmath64 is for the position in redshift space around @xmath65 .",
    "the scaling function plays the role of a window function . the scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 where @xmath47 is to show that the flux fluctuation @xmath49 in eq.(6 ) is for the @xmath48-th qso .",
    "the sfc @xmath66 is proportional to the mean flux over a bin size @xmath59 around the position @xmath64 .",
    "thus , with the dwt decomposition , eq.(4 ) becomes @xmath68 where the sfc of the mass field is given by @xmath69 therefore , eq.(7 ) is the dwt representation of eq.(4 ) .",
    "the sfcs @xmath66 and @xmath70 actually are , respectively , the fluctuations @xmath49 and @xmath43 in dwt representation .",
    "eq.(7 ) has been used in the dwt recovery of the initial linear power spectrum of the underlying mass field by the observed ly@xmath1 transmission flux ( feng & fang 2000 ) .",
    "the samples of transmitted fluxes @xmath42 used in our study comprise of 60 qsos spectra selected from bechtold ( 1994 ) , dobrzycki & bechtold ( 1996 ) , scott , bechtold & dobrzycki ( 2000 ) , and scott et al .",
    "the selection ensures that each spectrum in the calculation below is comparable to at least twice the length of the largest scale ( 92 h@xmath3mpc ) interested .",
    "the emission redshift of the qsos covers the range from 1.9 to 4.12 .",
    "each spectrum is averaged in bins of size @xmath71 , such that there are 1024 ` pixels ' per unit redshift , which converts to a resolution of @xmath72 km s@xmath3 .    using eq.(6 ) , we compute the sfcs @xmath66 of flux fluctuations @xmath49 for each qso .",
    "we use the so - called off - counting method to treat the spectra ( jamkhedkar , bi & fang 2001 ) , i.e. the sfc @xmath66 of modes @xmath73 is not counted in the calculation if the data at that mode are contaminated by metal line , bad , or low s / n pixels .",
    "an advantage of the dwt off - counting method is that the statistical results on large scales are not sensitive to the bad pieces on small scales .",
    "we treat all the data as ensembles of various modes @xmath73 .",
    "that is , for a given mode @xmath73 , the ensemble consists of all sfcs @xmath74 of the qsos that have flux observed around @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "thus , we can calculate the ensemble average of sfcs of each mode @xmath73 by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of the sfcs in the ensemble .",
    "since modes @xmath73 are localized in redshift space , we can also construct ensembles of the sfcs in different redshift ranges . for a given redshift range @xmath79 , the ensemble consists of all @xmath74 of which",
    "the label @xmath64 corresponds to position in the range @xmath79 . in the following calculations , we use three redshift ensembles .",
    "they are @xmath80=2.25 , 2.75 , and 3.25 with @xmath81 .",
    "the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the sfcs @xmath66 are calculated in the three redshift ranges .",
    "the result for @xmath82 is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the scale @xmath63 corresponds to redshift distance @xmath83 . in fig .",
    "1 , the physical scale of @xmath63 is calculated from the redshift distance @xmath84 at @xmath85 , for a lcdm model ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "for instance , the scale 92 h@xmath3 mpc corresponds to @xmath88 , or in wavelength @xmath89 .    in figure 1 , the panel on the smallest scale , i.e. 72 h@xmath3kpc , is the pdf of the binned distribution @xmath42 without the sfc smoothing , and therefore , it actually is the pdf of qso ly@xmath1 transmission , which has been done by many others ( e.g. mcdonald et al",
    "rather , figure 1 shows the scale dependence of the pdfs .",
    "when the smoothing scale is small ( large @xmath63 ) , the pdf is significantly non - gaussian , while it is essentially gaussian on large scales .",
    "the k - s test shows that the pdfs are gaussian on scales larger than 12 h@xmath3 mpc , and non - gaussian on scales less than @xmath90 h@xmath3 mpc .",
    "this is consistent with the authors previous work ( zhan , jamkhedkar , & fang 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , the variance of @xmath91 , or equivalently the variance of @xmath92 , is less than 1 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to calculate the density perturbations of the underlying mass field by eqs.(4 ) or ( 7 ) .",
    "all the above - mentioned properties are typical .",
    "that is , in other redshift ranges , the behavior of the @xmath66 pdfs is similar to figure 1 with a slight evolution in the redshift range considered .",
    "thus , on scales larger than 12 h@xmath3 mpc , one can calculate the sfcs of the mass field with eq.(7 ) . in these cases ,",
    "eq.(7 ) also insures that the variance of the density fluctuations @xmath36 is less than 1 , and therefore , the corresponding evolution of the mass field is still in the linear or quasi - linear regime .",
    "by definition , a 1-d radial density perturbation @xmath93 is given by the projection of the 3-d density perturbation @xmath94 into 1-d , i.e. @xmath95},\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the area of the coverage of samples on the celestial sphere .",
    "both @xmath97 and @xmath98 are larger than the scale considered in the radial ( or redshift ) direction . since velocity field @xmath8 is statistically homogeneous , we have @xmath99/l_x dy \\simeq 0 $ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath100 .",
    "thus , subjecting eq.(1 ) to the operation @xmath101 , we have a 1-d equation @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a 1-d velocity defined by @xmath104    in redshift space , eq.(11 ) is @xmath105 where @xmath106 comes from the expansion of the universe , @xmath107 is the radial component of the velocity field , and @xmath108 . for an lcdm model with @xmath109",
    ", we have @xmath110^{-1}$ ] , @xmath111 , @xmath112 ( peebles 1993 ) , and @xmath113 ( lahav et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath114 is almost diagonal in wavelet representation ( farge et al .",
    "1996 ) , and therefore , subjecting eq.(13 ) to a dwt with scaling function @xmath61 , we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the sfc of the velocity field , given by @xmath117 .",
    "the sfc @xmath116 is proportional to the bulk velocity @xmath118 on the spatial range given by the window function @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath120 since @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the so called connection coefficient of the basic scaling function ( e.g. restrepo & leaf 1995 ) , eq.(14 ) can be rewritten as @xmath123 this is the density - velocity linear eq.(1 ) in the dwt representation .",

    "eq.(17 ) gives @xmath131 ^ 2    w \\langle ( \\epsilon^{v}_{jl})^2 \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath132 .",
    "the ensemble of @xmath78 ly@xmath1 forests can be seen as a sampling of the sky with pencil beams .",
    "because the operation @xmath101 actually is an average over the celestial sphere , it can be statistically approximated by an ensemble average over the sky sampling .",
    "that is , the 1-d density perturbation @xmath93 can statistically be estimated by @xmath133 thus , using eqs.(7 ) , ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) , we have @xmath134 substituting eqs.(20 ) and ( 15 ) into eq.(18 ) , we finally have the estimator for the @xmath0 bulk velocity on scale @xmath63 , @xmath135 , of the underlying mass field of ly@xmath1 forests @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the pixel size in km s@xmath3 , and the physical length scale corresponding to @xmath63 is @xmath138^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the superscript @xmath38 is to remind that it is a projection along the @xmath15-direction . the @xmath0 bulk velocity on a given scale is then determined from the flux fluctuations @xmath54 on the same scale .    using the estimator eq.(21 ) , we calculate the @xmath0 bulk velocities for the three redshift regions @xmath139 with @xmath80= 2.25 , 2.75 , and 3.25 . the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "the scales in table 1 have the same meaning as those in fig .",
    "1 . in this calculation @xmath35",
    "is taken to be @xmath140 , and @xmath141 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the factor @xmath33 is calculated from the mean transmission @xmath142 in each redshift range via @xmath143 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the average over @xmath78 pencil beams in eq.(19 ) will cause a poisson error , which then contributes to the variance of @xmath93 .",
    "this problem is the same as the poisson correction in calculating the power spectrum of galaxies ( peebles 1980 , fang & feng 2000 ) . in table 1",
    "this correction has already been applied .",

    "it is essentially similar to the bootstrap error estimation ( mo , jing , & brner 1992 ) . besides this error , there are also systematic errors caused by the uncertainties of the factor @xmath51 in eq.(7 ) . for a given redshift range ,",
    "the uncertainty of the mean transmission @xmath33 is less than 10% , and the uncertainty of @xmath35 is about ( 1.9 - 1.5)/1.6 = 25% .",
    "therefore , the total systematic error would be about 30% .",
    "continuum  fitting may cause error if the continua @xmath24 of the 60 qsos fluctuate significantly on the same scale considered , say 92 h@xmath3 mpc .",
    "however , the pdfs of @xmath66 on large scales are perfectly gaussian .",
    "therefore , the sfc @xmath66 may be significantly contaminated by the continuum fluctuations _ only if _ the pdf of the continuum fluctuations is also gaussian .",
    "this seems quite unlikely , as the emission from each qso is highly non - thermal .",
    "all the 1-d @xmath0 bulk velocities listed in table 1 are consistent with the assumption in  2 , i.e. the peculiar velocity @xmath38 is much smaller than the spatial size considered , i.e. @xmath144 km s@xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the error from the resolution @xmath145 of the samples is also small , as @xmath145 is also much less than the spatial size considered . in other words ,",
    "the position and density uncertainties caused by @xmath38 in eq.(2 ) and @xmath145 are negligible in comparison with the scales listed in table 1 .",
    "we should point out that the result of table 1 is not sensitive to the choice of wavelets .",
    "our analysis relies only on the orthogonality , completeness , and locality of the scaling function .",
    "therefore , all wavelets with compactly supported basis will produce similar results .",
    "as expected , table 1 shows that @xmath146 decreases with scales from 23 to 92 h@xmath3mpc , and it also decreases with redshift from 2.25 to 3.25 .",
    "however , there is a dip of the bulk velocities on all scales at around z = 2.75 .",
    "this should be verified with other sets of ly@xmath1 qso transmission fluxes .",
    "to properly compare the estimated @xmath147 with other observed or theoretical results , we should emphasize that @xmath147 and @xmath118 are defined by the dwt decomposition of velocity field ( eq.[15 ] ) , not by the velocities of particles or galaxies .",
    "it has been point out recently that the velocity defined by the particle - counting or galaxy - counting method may have different statistical properties from that defined by velocity field decomposition ( yang et al . 2001 . ) therefore , we should compare our results with those that are also based on field decomposition if available .    from eqs.(12 ) and",
    "( 15 ) , we have @xmath148 in terms of the dwt analysis , the average @xmath149 can be replaced by scaling function projection window @xmath150 , where @xmath151 corresponds to scale @xmath97 .",
    "thus , eq.(22 ) can be rewritten as @xmath152 since the scales @xmath97 and @xmath98 are much larger than the radial scale @xmath59 considered , we have @xmath151,@xmath153 @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , @xmath147 actually is the 1-d @xmath0 bulk velocity of the 3-d mode @xmath155 with @xmath151,@xmath153 @xmath154 , i.e. @xmath156 . for a homogeneous and isotropic random mass field with a relatively flat power spectrum around 100 - 150 mpc , we have @xmath157 if @xmath158 , or equivalently , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are much larger than the physical scales of @xmath63 ( yang et al 2001 ) .",
    "since the results listed in table 1 are derived for high redshifts , there is no directly measured result available for comparison . the bulk velocity in a sphere of radius 50 h@xmath3mpc around the local group is found to be @xmath159 km s@xmath3 ( dekel et al 1998 ) .",
    "the scale of the sphere is comparable to the linear scale 92 h@xmath3mpc in table 1 .",
    "if this result can be considered as the bulk velocity of a box 100@xmath160 h@xmath161mpc@xmath162 , the corresponding 1-d bulk velocity @xmath118 on scale 100 h@xmath3mpc ( with @xmath163h@xmath3mpc ) is about @xmath164 km s@xmath3 ( the first @xmath165 is due to the transform from 3-d to 1-d of the velocity , and the second @xmath165 is due to the transform from mode @xmath166 to @xmath167 ) . considering linear redshift evolution , this 1-d bulk velocity yields 99 , 92 and 88 km s@xmath3 at redshift @xmath1682.25 , 2.75 , and 3.25 , respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with that shown in table 1 .",
    "nevertheless we should remember that the bulk velocity 370 km s@xmath3 is from one realization , not @xmath0 value , and it may have the uncertainties of galaxy - counting as well as galaxy bias .",
    "the 1-d @xmath0 bulk velocity in the dwt modes @xmath166 at redshift @xmath169 has been calculated from n body simulations .",
    "the results on 92 h@xmath3mpc are 60@xmath210 km s@xmath3 , 70@xmath220 km s@xmath3 , and 80@xmath220 km s@xmath3 for the scdm , lcdm and @xmath170cdm models respectively ( yang et al 2001 ) .",
    "all models give lower @xmath0 bulk velocity than that shown in table 1 .",
    "one can not , however , conclude that the n body simulated result is inconsistent with that shown in table 1 .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 bulk velocity is sensitive to the perturbation on large scales , while the simulation box in yang et al ( 2001 ) is 256@xmath160 h@xmath161mpc@xmath160 .",
    "it has been pointed out ( tormen & bertschinger 1996 ) that the linear 3-d @xmath0 bulk velocity of a cube of side 100 mpc is well over 500 km s@xmath3 for an scdm model with @xmath171 .",
    "correspondingly , for an lcdm model with @xmath172 the 1-d @xmath0 bulk velocities of dwt mode @xmath173 h@xmath3mpc ) , i.e. @xmath174 , are 110 km s@xmath3 , 105 km s@xmath3 , and 100 km s@xmath3 at @xmath1682.25 , 2.75 , and 3.25 respectively .",
    "therefore , the results shown in table 1 basically are consistent with the linear evolution theory within 1@xmath175 confidence level",
    ".    we should also emphasize that the average over a qso ensemble , i.e. average over the celestial sphere , is important .",
    "the errors in table 1 also comes from the fact that the number of ly@xmath1 forests in a given redshift bin is still small ( large poisson correction caused by eq.[19 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can already conclude that a set of ly@xmath1 forests can provide a valuable estimate of the @xmath0 bulk velocity of the underlying mass field on scales from a few tens to @xmath176 100 h@xmath3mpc .",
    "with a large set of ly@xmath1 forests , one may map the bulk velocity on large scales in a wide range of redshift , and then , set a robust constraint on the power spectrum on large scales ."
