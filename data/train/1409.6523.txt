    "for very long qpo periods , @xmath80 , the delays due to light - travel time can be neglected and the qpo profiles just reflect variations of the illumination of the disc by the x - ray source and of the viewing angle of the disc surface . for the parameters @xmath81  cm ( typical for low - mass x - ray binaries ) and the qpo range between @xmath82  hz , the possible range of parameter @xmath77 is between @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "the integrals in equation  ( [ eq : reprocessing ] ) should generally be computed numerically ; however , it is interesting to consider a case when they can be taken analytically .",
    "this can also be used as a benchmark for the precise numerical calculations .",
    "let us first consider the situation where the reprocessing occurs in a thin ring ( @xmath85 ) , which is located sufficiently close to the x - ray source ( @xmath86 ) , i.e. the response is immediate and we can put @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , the ring is located high enough above the orbital plane and the angle @xmath4 is small enough so that the x - ray source is always seen from the entire ring ( this translates to the condition @xmath71 at any phase ) .",
    "we assume that the emission pattern of the central source follows the lambert law , which leads to the emissivity function @xmath88 ( we also put @xmath89 ) . under these conditions ,",

    "[ fig : analytic_profile ] .",
    "interestingly , the reprocessed emission is coming ( almost ) in anti - phase with the x - rays . for @xmath91",
    "it is easy to see from equation  ( [ eq : lrepr_analyt ] ) that the minima and maxima are achieved at @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , and vice versa for the x - rays ( see equation  ( [ eq : cos_theta_obs ] ) ) .",
    "physically , the maximum in reprocessing is achieved when the x - rays are illuminating the opposite from the observer side of the disc which has the largest projected area .",
    "this analytical solution , though , is unlikely to be realized in a realistic situation , as the x - ray emissivity function deviates from the simple cosine dependence .",
    "we investigate the effect of changing parameters on the qpo profiles by the direct calculations of reprocessing light curves for a more realistic x - ray emissivity function ( see section  [ sect : xray_qpos ] ) .",
    "optical and x - ray qpo profiles are calculated by assuming a radial emissivity @xmath25 for each band .",
    "we fix @xmath94 and an observer inclination @xmath95 and consider changing @xmath42 , @xmath96 , @xmath75 and @xmath77 .",
    "we find that the parameter @xmath42 does not alter the profile shapes and only affects the amplitudes of oscillations ( with higher rms obtained for the cases when the observer sees relatively larger disc area ) , while the decrease of @xmath75 results in somewhat faster response and more smearing of the signal , i.e. lower rms .",
    "the increase of parameter @xmath96 generally introduces a larger phase shift of the optical light - curve , in addition , the larger is this parameter , the lower is the optical variability rms .",
    "this results from the decrease of the x - ray rms towards lower inclinations ( or , essentially , towards lower angles @xmath97 ) .",
    "the major effect on the qpo profiles comes from changing parameter @xmath77 .",
    "we consider three cases : @xmath98 , 0.5 and 2 .",
    "the resulting profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reproc_profile_routnuqpo ] .",
    "it is evident that the optical qpos arising from reprocessing have larger amplitudes than those seen in the x - rays by the distant observer ( with their ratio reaching a factor of 10 at low azimuth @xmath99 ) .",
    "we have studied the qpo profiles at the @xmath13@xmath14 plane and found that this is true for majority of the simulations ( except for the area with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which , however , can not be described properly with the presented model , because the effects of non - zero thickness of the hot flow become important ) .",
    "the main reason for that is the strong increase of the rms in x - rays with increasing viewing angle ( i.e. , inclination in the case of observer and the corresponding angle @xmath102 for the disc ) .",
    "small opening angles ( realistic values are between 6  and 22 , see @xcite and references therein ) thus result in substantially higher variation amplitudes of the x - rays seen by the disc relative to those seen by the observer . in addition , the x - ray variability seen by the disc is different from that seen by the observer for the same reason .",
    "this means that it is not feasible to find any kind of qpo response function , which could give the optical qpo profiles from the observed x - ray qpos .",
    "another interesting observation is that at @xmath103 the optical qpo profile strongly depends on @xmath14 , being nearly sinusoidal at small @xmath14 , with the growing harmonic content at larger @xmath14 , where the amplitude of the fundamental drops significantly . the reasons for that being the violation of the irradiation condition ( [ eq : irr_cond3 ] ) and the complex shape of x - ray emission pattern .",
    "at higher @xmath104 , the profiles are more sinusoidal with a low harmonic content .",
    "we finally note that the overall optical rms can be reduced by the presence of other , non - oscillating or oscillating out - of - phase , components .",
    "for instance , additional constant flux may arise because of the viscous heating in the disc .",
    "also , the x - ray source likely has a non - zero thickness , thus the entire disc has an additional constant irradiated component . and finally , reflection of the x - rays from the optically thin corona or wind would produce a nearly constant illumination over the disc surface leading to the reduction of the qpo amplitude .",
    "x      often the optical qpo profile can not be measured and the only available information is its rms .",
    "the ratio of the light - crossing time to the outer disc to the qpo period , @xmath77 , is the major factor affecting the rms , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsnuqpo ] . the constant level at low frequencies reflects the fact that the light - travel time to the outer disc is much below the qpo period , so that the response can be considered as immediate .",
    "the qpo profile is then completely determined by the varying illumination of the outer disc due to precession of the anisotropic and non - axisymmetric x - ray source .",
    "we see that the constant level is very different for different observer s azimuth @xmath14 , being close to 20 per cent at @xmath105 and dropping to nearly zero at @xmath106 ( we note that the harmonic here is stronger ) .    at high @xmath107 ,",
    "the rms drops dramatically due to smearing . rather unexpectedly we find that the rms has a strong peak at @xmath108 .",
    "the peak does not appear only for inclination @xmath109 .",
    "for @xmath110 , the rms reaches 1725 per cent , depending on the inclination . at larger @xmath111 ,",
    "the rms is about 15 per cent which is substantially larger than that at low @xmath107 .",
    "this resonance - like feature results from the fact that the reprocessing signals from both the closest and the furthest ( to the observer ) parts of the disc are coming in phase .",
    "we conclude here that the optical qpos arising from reprocessing of the x - ray radiation from an anisotropic precessing source can be identified in the data using its frequency dependence .",
    "the rms is predicted to be constant at low frequencies , to have a peak at @xmath108 and disappear at @xmath112 .",
    "the critical qpo frequency depends on the disc size , which is itself a function of binary separation , @xmath113 ( for small mass ratios ; see @xcite ) . using the third kepler law ( and taking @xmath114 )",
    ", we can relate it to the orbital period ( in hours ) : @xmath115      an alternative way to identify the reprocessing qpo in the data is from its wavelength dependence .",
    "different wavelengths correspond to different parts of the irradiated disc ( blackbody ) spectrum , resulting in variation of parameter @xmath0 ( introduced in equation  [ eq : repro_lum ] ) . combining relations @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    ", we get @xmath118 in this paper , we considered cases with the linear response , @xmath89 , which takes place close to the wavelengths of the blackbody peak . for the irradiated disc temperature of about 10000  k , this corresponds to the @xmath119-filter .",
    "the rms is higher at shorter wavelengths , where @xmath0 exceeds 1 and it is smaller at longer wavelengths , where it tends to the rayleigh ",
    "jeans value @xmath120 .",
    "thus at long wavelengths the optical ( or rather ir ) qpo should have four times smaller rms than those computed here . on the other hand ,",
    "in the wien part of the spectrum @xmath0 can exceed unity and the qpo amplitude grows .",
    "in addition to the wavelength dependence of the reprocessing qpo itself , it is likely that additional spectral components influence that . the irradiated disc spectrum may be contaminated by the emission from the hot flow , jet , or circumstellar dust , which likely reduce the overall rms , with a somewhat larger suppression at longer wavelengths because their spectra are significantly redder than the spectrum of the disc .",
    "this fact further strengthens the dependence of rms on the wavelength , which should grow towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "the low - frequency qpo range observed in the x - rays is @xmath121  hz @xcite .",
    "for relatively small discs present in systems with periods of a few hours , the temperature at the outer edge of the disc is substantially higher , roughly @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the orbital period ( we assumed that the x - ray luminosity is the same ) .",
    "thus , irradiation gives significant contribution to the uv flux , but not to the ir , where the disc is likely very dim compared to other components .",
    "the discs in the long - period systems are large enough and cool enough to give significant contribution to the ir , but the qpos in such systems are expected to be seen only at low frequencies . at the same time , the uv reprocessed emission in these systems is produced closer to the bh and hence the qpos may be observed at relatively higher frequencies . to calculate the profiles in this case",
    ", we would need to take into account the fact that @xmath38 and the outer disc radius @xmath39 are not equal .",
    "in gx  3394 , the optical qpo frequency was seen to vary between 0.05 and 0.13  hz @xcite .",
    "the qpo features were observed in three filters simultaneously @xcite .",
    "they have systematically larger rms in the redder filters for all three nights of observations ( see their table  4 ) , though only the difference in rms observed during the third night are statistically significant .",
    "the system period is rather long , about 42  h @xcite , so that the maximum reprocessing qpo ( see equation  ( [ eq : numax ] ) ) is expected to be at @xmath124  hz , where we assumed @xmath125 .",
    "thus the observed qpos are likely produced either by the hot flow or in the jet .",
    "swift  j1753.50127 is one of the shortest - period systems with @xmath126  h @xcite .",
    "the optical qpos in this object were detected during the simultaneous x - ray exposure at frequencies @xmath1270.08  hz @xcite .",
    "the computed optical / x - ray ccfs do not resemble those of the irradiated disc , on the contrary , a prominent optical precognition dip is observed .",
    "the dip may be a signature of the hot flow synchrotron emission @xcite , and its amplitude relative to the positive peak ( attributed to irradiation ) implies that the hot flow is a dominant source of optical photons , and hence the qpos .",
    "both optical and uv qpos were detected in xte  j1118 + 480 at frequencies @xmath1270.070.13  hz @xcite .",
    "the uv rms seems to be increasing with qpo frequency ( see table  4 of @xcite ) , but because the errors on the deduced rms are not listed , it is not clear whether this effect is real .",
    "the system is otherwise a good candidate to expect the qpos from irradiation , as it has a rather short period of about 4  h @xcite .",
    "though the system demonstrates the precognition dip structure in the ccfs @xcite , the dip amplitude is significantly smaller than that of the peak in the optical / x - ray ccf and the dip in the uv / x - ray ccf is even less prominent @xcite .",
    "we developed a model for the optical qpos arising from the irradiation of the accretion disc by varying x - ray flux . assuming that the inner part of the accretion disc is occupied by a precessing hot accretion flow ( radiating in the x - rays ) with the prescribed emission pattern , we calculate the optical profiles .",
    "the oscillations at the precession period appear due to the changing of the illumination conditions .",
    "we note that the distant observer sees the x - ray source at an angle different from that seen from the outer disc .",
    "this means that simple use of the disc transfer function relating the observed x - ray and optical light curves is insufficient to reproduce optical profiles  the additional knowledge of the x - ray emission pattern is required .",
    "we find that the qpo rms is nearly constant for sufficiently low frequencies , @xmath128 , it then increases to achieve the maximum at @xmath108 and drops dramatically at higher frequencies .",
    "this is an identifying feature of the proposed mechanism , by which it can be distinguished from the optical qpos arising from the hot flow .",
    "another way to recognize it is the dependence of the rms on the wavelength , where the increase of the variability amplitude towards shorter wavelengths is expected .",
    "the described qpo mechanism inevitably should play a role in all systems with the sufficiently small ratio of the outer disc size to the qpo period .",
    "however , the observed oscillation amplitudes are expected to be lower than predicted here because of the substantial non - variable background . as other components ,",
    "which do potentially contribute to the optical emission ( e.g. the hot flow and the jet ) , can also generate qpos , finding the signatures of reprocessed emission in the oscillating signal becomes a challenging task .",
    "the most promising low - mass x - ray binary systems , which are expected to have optical qpo due to reprocessing , are those showing a prominent positive peak in the optical / x - ray ccf , corresponding to the irradiation delays of the aperiodic x - ray variability .",
