    "<S> magnetic skyrmions have attracted broad attention during recent years because they are regarded as promising candidates as bits of information in novel data storage devices . </S>",
    "<S> a broad range of theoretical and experimental investigations have been conducted with the consideration of rotational symmetric skyrmions in isotropic environments . however , one naturally observes a huge variety of anisotropic behavior in many experimentally relevant materials . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the influence of anisotropic environments onto the formation and behavior of the non - collinear spin states of skyrmionic materials by means of monte - carlo calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we find skyrmionic textures which are far from having a rotational symmetric shape . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show the possibility to employ periodic modulations of the environment to create skyrmionic tracks .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic skyrmions were originally proposed and investigated in theoretical studies@xcite and only recently , they were found experimentally in the bulk and thin films of non - centrosymmetric materials@xcite as well as in ultra - thin magnetic films at crystal surfaces@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are particle - like objects with a non - vanishing topological charge that is considered to protect them from continuous transformation into the saturated magnetic state . together with their small lateral size in the nanometer range </S>",
    "<S> , this makes skyrmions an interesting candidate for bits of information and information carriers in novel data storage devices @xcite . typically , magnetic skyrmions form due to the competition of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction@xcite and the exchange interaction in the presence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the dm interaction can provide a non - vanishing contribution in the presence of inversion asymmetry combined with a large spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of skyrmions have both theoretically and experimentally mainly been investigated in the context of materials providing an isotropic environment up to now which leads to the formation of skyrmions with a rotational symmetric equilibrium shape . </S>",
    "<S> there are only few studies that deal with the influence of anisotropic environments and only recently , the experimental observation of skyrmions which are deformed with respect to the rotational symmetric shape has been reported for chiral magnets with crystal lattice strain@xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    however , various experimentally feasible materials naturally exhibit anisotropic behavior for multiple reasons . in the discussion of the origins , we focus on the material systems that allow for interface induced skyrmionic states , only . </S>",
    "<S> these material systems typically consist of a single or multiple atomic , magnetic layers of different atomic species which are deposited succeedingly onto a non - magnetic supporting crystal </S>",
    "<S> . the combination of materials with different lattice constants can give rise to lattice strain and reconstructions in the magnetic surface layers which then exhibit anisotropic environments as has been discussed only recently for the double@xcite and triple@xcite atomic layers of fe on ir(111 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the influence of anisotropic environments onto the behavior of skyrmionic states is already interesting for practical reasons . </S>",
    "<S> more intriguing is , especially with respect to technological applications , to study the capability of tailoring the properties of skyrmions such as their shape and lateral position by anisotropic environments .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we report on monte - carlo investigations of the magnetic pattern formation in systems with modulated environments and show skyrmionic states which exhibit shapes very different from the rotational symmetric ones that have been discussed in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> also , we discuss the possibility to align skyrmions along tracks and relate it to recent investigations conducted on the double and triple layers of fe on ir(111)@xcite .    we describe a skyrmionic ultra - thin magnetic film by the standard effective hamiltonian    @xmath0    consisting of the exchange energy , the dm energy , the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the zeeman energy . </S>",
    "<S> the classical three - dimensional spins @xmath1 of unit length can rotate freely on the unit sphere . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an isotropic nearest neighbor dm interaction strength @xmath2 and for symmetry reasons we assume dm - vectors which both lie in the plane of the magnetic film and are perpendicular to the connection line between neighboring spins@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 provide the exchange energy parameter , the anisotropy energy parameter , the direction of the uniaxial anisotropy , the magnetic moment and an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed phase space of a magnetic film which can be described by an hamiltonian of the type given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn : hamilton ] with an isotropic exchange interaction can be found elsewhere@xcite . in order to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> a spin - spiral state with a fixed rotational sense is the ground state at low temperatures and zero external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the application of a perpendicular external magnetic field can cause the system to exhibit a skyrmionic state at an intermediate field strength or the saturated ferromagnetic state at a sufficiently large field .    </S>",
    "<S> we use two - dimensional triangular lattices with the lattice constant @xmath8 and mimic the behavior of multiple magnetic layers by employing effective nearest - neighbor exchange interaction parameters @xmath3 similar to previous investigations of the orientation of domain walls @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we go beyond the earlier model and modulate the strength of the exchange coupling not only as a function of the orientation of the respective bond but as a generalization also of the position in the lattice according to the following description    @xmath9}\\right ] \\right )    \\label{eqn : modulation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equation [ eqn : j ] is equivalent to the parametrization of an ellipse with the semi - major axis @xmath10 and semi - minor axis @xmath11 in the case of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the ellipse lies within the plane of the magnetic film and the direction of the major axis @xmath13 is locally rotated by the angle @xmath14 with respect to the @xmath15 $ ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is the vector connecting the lattice sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the choice of unequal parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 provides an anisotropic interaction strength which then depends on the crystallographic direction . the angle @xmath19 and the period @xmath20 in units of @xmath8 can be used to create a periodic modulation of the anisotropic exchange environment along the crystallographic direction @xmath15 $ ] .     sites with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath21 $ ] direction . the arrows in ( b),(c ) give the direction for the in - plane contrasts . </S>",

    "<S> the interaction strengths are @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the anisotropy is @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the system was decreased from @xmath28 to @xmath29 using @xmath30 temperature steps with @xmath31 monte - carlo steps each ensuring that the global energy minimum is reached . </S>",
    "<S> we used a single spin update mechanism based on the metropolis algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spin - spirals have a wave length of approximately @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the wave fronts are on average aligned in parallel to the @xmath15 $ ] direction and the periodicity of their zigzag pattern is in agreement with the modulation period of the exchange energy . </S>",

    "<S> an increase of the modulation amplitude @xmath36 causes the single peaks at @xmath37 to split into double peaks with a distance of approximately @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the present model seems to capture the main features of the spin - spiral states which have been observed experimentally in the double and triple atomic layers of fe on ir(111)@xcite .    however , it is more intriguing to explore the influence of the modulation of the exchange energy onto the skyrmion state . </S>",

    "<S> so far , we have focused on the effects of a spatial modulation of the exchange energy parameter in skyrmionic materials and neglected the anisotropy energy . however , from previous studies it is known that the anisotropy energy can in principle vary locally in thin magnetic films@xcite . in the following , we investigate the effects of a spatial modulation of the anisotropy energy in combination with an isotropic exchange and dm interaction . </S>",

    "<S> their centers lie in the middle of the regions that possess an anisotropy axis parallel to the @xmath21 $ ] direction and their elongation into the @xmath15 $ ] direction is determined by the areas in which the anisotropy axis is parallel to the @xmath15 $ ] direction . </S>",
