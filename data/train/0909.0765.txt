    "it is possible to derive an asymptotic expression for radiative transfer between two large spheres separated by a very small gap ( gap is very small compared to the radius of either of the spheres ) from the well known results of radiative transfer between two semi  infinite objects @xcite . this idea is used extensively in determining van der waals or casimir force between macroscopic curved objects and is known as the proximity force approximation @xcite and expressed as the proximity force theorem @xcite . the usage of the proximity force approximation to determine near  field radiative transfer between curved surfaces has not been verified by other numerical solutions or by experiments .",

    "this formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics was pioneered by rytov @xcite and is used widely for analyzing near  field radiative transfer @xcite . though the emphasis of this work is on near  field radiative transfer , it should be pointed that this formalism includes far  field contribution to radiative transfer .",

    "a @xmath24 variation of conductance as determined by a more rigorous theory can be taken as evidence of the validity of the proximity type approximation at the value of the gap . despite their origin in fluctuations of the electromagnetic field ,",
    "a significant difference between force and flux is that the force decays to a negligible quantity in the far  field whereas thermal flux attains a finite value in the far  field .",
    "this implies that those parts of the spheres with larger gaps contribute very little to force whereas they could contribute significanly to flux because of the larger areas involved .",
