    "recent solar @xcite , atmospheric@xcite , reactor@xcite and accelerator@xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very robust evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed . the canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite gives a very simple and appealing explanation of the smallness of left - handed neutrino masses  it is attributed to the largeness of right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "the existence of neutrino oscillations implies the violation of lepton flavors .",
    "hence the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays in the charged - lepton sector , such as @xmath3 , should also take place .",
    "they are unobservable in the standard model ( sm ) , because their decay amplitudes are expected to be highly suppressed by the ratios of neutrino masses ( @xmath4 ev ) to the @xmath5-boson mass ( @xmath6 gev ) . in the supersymmetric extension of the sm , however , the branching ratios of such rare processes can be enormously enlarged .",
    "current experimental bounds on the lfv decays @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are@xcite @xmath10 the sensitivities of a few planned experiments@xcite may reach @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    for simplicity ,",
    "here we work in the framework of the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) extended with two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos . then all the soft breaking terms are diagonal at high energy scales , and the only source of lepton flavor violation in the charged - lepton sector is the radiative correction to the soft terms through the neutrino yukawa couplings . in other words ,",
    "the low - energy lfv processes @xmath14 are induced by the rge effects of the slepton mixing .",
    "the branching ratios of @xmath14 are given by @xcite @xmath15 ^ 2 |c^{}_{ij}|^2 \\tan^2 \\beta \\ ; , %        ( 2)\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the universal scalar soft mass and the trilinear term at @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath19 is a typical mass of superparticles , can be approximately written as @xcite @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the gaugino mass ; and @xmath22 with @xmath23 gev to be fixed in our calculations .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 ) represent the dirac neutrino mass matrix and the masses of the heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos , respectively .",
    "to calculate the branching ratios of @xmath14 , we need to know the following parameters in the framework of the msugra : @xmath21 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these parameters can be constrained from cosmology ( by demanding that the proper supersymmetric particles should give rise to an acceptable dark matter density ) and low - energy measurements ( such as the process @xmath29 and the anomalous magnetic moment of muon @xmath30 ) .",
    "here we adopt the snowmass points and slopes ( sps ) @xcite listed in table .",
    "1 . these points and slopes are a set of benchmark points and parameter lines in the msugra parameter space corresponding to different scenarios in the search for supersymmetry at present and future experiments .",
    "since the canonical seesaw models are usually pestered with too many parameters , specific assumptions have to be made for @xmath24 or @xmath25 so as to calculate the lfv rare decays @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lfv processes have also been discussed in the supersymmetric minimal seesaw model ( msm ) @xcite , in which only two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos are introduced @xcite . in the msm ,",
    "all model parameters can in principle be fixed by use of the lfv rare decays and eletric dipole moment of the electron @xcite .",
    "ibarra and ross discuss that the lfv processes may constrain the masses of right - handed heavy majorana neutrinos @xcite . in the frampton - glashow - yanagida @xcite ( fgy )",
    "ansatz , raidal and strumia have given analytic approximations to the lfv rare decays for the normal hierarchy case @xcite . as shown in the literature @xcite , the fgy ansatz only includes three unknown parameters : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the smallest mixing angle @xmath33 . in this paper",
    ", we are going to numerically compute the lfv processes in terms of @xmath33 for both normal and inverted hierarchies in the fgy ansatz . in the following parts",
    ", we shall show that the branching ratio of @xmath0 may distinguish the neutrino mass hierarchies , the jarlskog parameter of cp violation ( @xmath34 ) and the effective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath35)@xcite . ] .",
    "in addition , once the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath2 is measured , one may distinguish the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies , and confirm the masses of two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos by means of the lfv processes and the thermal leptogenesis mechanism@xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that this conclusion is independent of the msugra parameters .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe the main features of the fgy ansatz and the thermal leptogenesis in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in section iii ,",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath0 is computed in terms of the sps . in section iv",
    ", we numerically calculated the ratio of @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "finally the summary are given in section v.",
    "in the supersymmetric extension of the msm , two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 ) are introduced as the @xmath40 singlets . the lagrangian relevant for lepton masses",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the left - handed lepton doublet , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 stand respectively for the right - handed charged - lepton and neutrino singlets . @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( with hypercharges @xmath47 ) are the mssm higgs doublet superfields . after the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , one obtains the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath48 and the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 being the vev of the higgs doublet @xmath51 ( for @xmath52 ) .",
    "an important parameter @xmath53 is defined by @xmath54 or @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the heavy right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath57 is a @xmath58 symmetric matrix and @xmath59 is a @xmath60 matrix . without loss of generality",
    ", we work in the flavor basis where @xmath61 and @xmath57 are both diagonal , real and positive ; i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the seesaw relation @xcite @xmath64 remains valid .",
    "note that this canonical seesaw relation holds up to the accuracy of @xmath65 @xcite . since @xmath57 is of rank 2",
    ", @xmath66 is also a rank-2 matrix with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 ( for @xmath69 ) are the masses of three light neutrinos . as for three neutrino masses",
    "@xmath70 , the solar neutrino oscillation data have set @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "now that the lightest neutrino in the msm must be massless , we are then left with either @xmath72 ( normal mass hierarchy ) or @xmath73 ( inverted mass hierarchy ) . with the best - fit values @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite , one can numerically calculate the neutrino masses @xcite .    in the fgy ansatz @xcite",
    ", @xmath24 is taken to be of the form @xmath76 with the help of eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) , one may straightforwardly arrive at @xmath77 without loss of generality , one can always redefine the phases of left - handed lepton fields to make @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 real and positive .",
    "in this basis , only @xmath81 is complex and its phase @xmath82 is the sole source of cp violation in the model under consideration .",
    "because @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 of @xmath24 have been taken to be real and positive , @xmath66 may be diagonalized in a more general way @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is lepton flavor mixing matrix @xcite parameterized as @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and so on .",
    "@xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 hold as a good approximation @xcite . in view of the current experimental data , we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( best - fit values ) as well as @xmath94 at the @xmath95 confidence level @xcite .",
    "it is worth remarking that there is only a single nontrivial majorana cp - violating phase ( @xmath96 ) in the msm , as a straightforward consequence of @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "note that all six phase parameters ( @xmath99 , @xmath96 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath53 and @xmath102 ) have been determined in terms of @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath33 @xcite : @xmath106 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\arctan \\left [ \\frac{c^{}_x s^{}_y \\sin\\delta } { s^{}_x c^{}_y s^{}_z + c^{}_x s^{}_y \\cos\\delta } \\right ] \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\alpha & = & -\\frac{1}{2 } \\arctan \\left [ \\frac{r^{2}_{23 } s^2_x",

    "similar results can also be obtained for the inverted mass hierarchy ( @xmath98 ) @xcite , but we do not elaborate on them here . because @xmath108 must hold , we find @xmath109 ( @xmath107 ) and @xmath110 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "hence , a measurement of the unknown angle @xmath33 becomes crucial to test the model .    in the flavor basis where the mass matrices of charged leptons and right - handed neutrinos are diagonal , one can calculate the cp asymmetry in the decays of the lighter right - handed neutrino and obtain@xcite @xmath111 when @xmath112 , where we have used @xmath113 then @xmath114 can result in a net lepton number asymmetry @xmath115 .",

    "it has been shown that @xmath132 gev ( @xmath133 ) and @xmath134 gev ( @xmath135 ) are required by the current observational data of @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "flavor effects in the mechanism of thermal leptogenesis have recently attracted a lot of attention@xcite . because the @xmath136 yukawa coupling are in thermal equilibrium for @xmath137",
    "gev , the flavor issue should be taken into account in our model for the @xmath133 case . using the analytic approximate formulas in the ref.@xcite",
    ", one may calculate the cp - violating asymmetry @xmath138 and the corresponding wash - out parameter @xmath139 for the @xmath136 lepton doublet in the final states of @xmath140 decays .",
    "we find @xmath141 and @xmath142 because of @xmath143 , namely the @xmath144 decays involving the @xmath136 lepton doublet do nt contribute to the baryon asymmetry @xmath145 . on the other hand ,",
    "the cp - violating asymmetry @xmath146 , which is produced by the out - of - equilibrium decays of @xmath147 , vanishes .",
    "therefore , such flavor effects may be negligible in our paper .",
    "note that there is in general a potential conflict between achieving successful thermal leptogenesis and avoiding overproduction of gravitinos in the msm with supersymmetry @xcite unless the gravitinos are heavier than @xmath148 tev @xcite .",

    "such a problem could be circumvented in other supersymmetric breaking mediation scenarios ( e.g. , gauge mediation @xcite ) or in a class of supersymmetric axion models @xcite , where the gravitino mass can be much lighter in spite of the very high reheating temperature . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose @xmath151 as an input parameter in this paper .",

    "the reason is that @xmath165 ( or @xmath166 ) implies @xmath167 ( or @xmath168 ) .",
    "furthermore , the successful leptogenesis requires a very large @xmath31 due to @xmath169 .",
