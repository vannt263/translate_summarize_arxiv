    "following the seminal work of markowitz @xcite , the problem of optimization of an investor s portfolio based on different criteria and market assumptions are being studied by several authors . in the mean - variance optimization approach ,",
    "as done by markowitz , either the expected value of the portfolio wealth is optimized by keeping the variance fixed or the variance is minimized by keeping the expectation fixed .",
    "though markowitz s mean - variance approach to portfolio is immensely useful in practice , its scope is limited by the fact that only gaussian distributions are completely determined by their first two moments . in a pioneering work merton @xcite , @xcite has introduced the utility maximization to the optimal portfolio selection .",
    "merton s approach is based on applying the method of stochastic optimal control via an appropriate hamilton - jacobi- bellman ( hjb ) equation .",
    "the corresponding optimal dynamic portfolio allocation can also be obtained from the same equation .",
    "although this approach has greater mathematical tractability but does not capture the tradeoff between maximizing expectation and minimizing variance of portfolio value .    there is another approach , namely risk sensitive optimization , where a tradeoff between the long run expected growth rate and the asymptotic variance is captured in an implicit way .",
    "the aforesaid utility maximization method can be employed to study the risk - sensitive optimization by choosing a parametric family of exponential utility functions . in such optimization ,",
    "an appropriate value of the parameter is to be chosen by the investor depending on the investors degree of risk tolerance .",
    "we refer @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for this criterion under the geometric brownian motion ( gbm ) market model .",
    "risk sensitive optimization of portfolio value in a more general type of market is also studied by various authors .",
    "jump diffusion model is one such generalization , which captures the discontinuity of asset dynamics .",
    "empirical results support such models @xcite .",
    "terminal utility optimization problem under such a model assumption is studied in @xcite . in all these references",
    ", it is assumed that the market parameters , i.e. , the coefficients in the asset price dynamics , are either constant or deterministic functions of time .",
    "we study a class of models where these parameters are allowed to be finite state pure jump processes .",
    "we call each state of the coefficients as a regime and the dynamics as a regime switching model",
    ". the regime switching can be of various types .",
    "it is known that for a markov switching model , the sojourn or holding times in each state are distributed as exponential random variables , whereas the holding time can be any positive random variable for the semi - markov case .",
    "thus the class of semi - markov processes subsumes the class of markov chains .",
    "there are some statistical results in the literature ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , which emphasize the advantage of the applicability of semi - markov switching models over simple homogeneous markov switching models .",
    "it is mainly useful to deal with the impact of a changing environment , which exhibits duration dependence . to understand this , consider a market situation where ,",
    "if the volatility of certain stock price remains low for longer than certain duration , then that observation discourages increasingly more traders to trade on that depending on the length of the duration . in that case",
    ", this type of duration dependence mass - trading behaviour might cause further low volume trading resulting in lack of volatility boost . in this type of market behaviour",
    ", the density function of holding time of low volatility regime should exhibit heavier tail than exponential .",
    "it is important to note that , a markov chain either time homogeneous or in - homogeneous does not exhibit such age dependent transition , whereas a generic semi - markov process may exhibit this phenomenon .",
    "this motivate us to consider age - dependent transition of the regimes .",
    "risk sensitive portfolio optimization in a gbm model with markov regimes is studied in @xcite whereas @xcite studies the same problem in a semi - markov modulated gbm model . in @xcite the market parameters ,",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are driven by a finite - state semi - markov process @xmath3 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the drift and volatility parameters of @xmath4-th asset in the portfolio . strictly speaking ,",
    "the assumption that all the parameters from different assets are governed by a single semi - markov process is rather restrictive .",
    "ideally those could be driven by independent or correlated processes in practice .",
    "although two independent markov processes jointly becomes a markov process , the same phenomena is not true for semi - markov processes .",
    "for this reason the case of independent regimes are important where regimes are not markov .",
    "in general a pure jump process need not be a semi - markov process .",
    "in particular the class of age - dependent processes ( as in @xcite ) is much wider than the type of age independent semi - markov processes studied in @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", option pricing is studied in a switching market where the regimes are assumed to be an age - dependent process .",
    "an age - dependent process @xmath5 on a finite state space @xmath6 is specified by its instantaneous transition rate @xmath7 , which is a collection of measurable functions @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , embedding @xmath11 in @xmath12 , an age dependent process , @xmath13 on @xmath11 is defined as the strong solution to the following system of stochastic integral equations @xmath14}{\\displaystyle\\int\\limits}_{\\mathbb{r } } h_{\\lambda}(x_{u- } , y_{u-},z)\\wp(du , dz),\\\\   y_t & = y_0 + t- { \\displaystyle\\int\\limits}_{(0,t ] } { \\displaystyle\\int\\limits}_{\\mathbb{r } } g_{\\lambda}(x_{u- } , y_{u-},z ) \\wp(du , dz ) , \\end{array}\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the poisson random measure with intensity @xmath16 , independent of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and for every @xmath19 , @xmath20 , using a strict total order @xmath21 on @xmath22 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a proof that @xmath7 indeed represents instantaneous transition rate of @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    "we consider a regime switching jump diffusion model of a financial market , where an observed euclidean space valued pure jump process drives the regimes of every asset .",
    "further , we assume that every component of that pure jump process is an age dependent semi - markov process and the components are independent .",
    "we study the finite horizon portfolio optimization via the risk sensitive criterion under the above market assumption .",
    "the optimization problem is solved by studying the corresponding hjb equation where we employ the technique of separation of variables to reduce the hjb equation to a system of linear first order pdes containing some non - local terms . in the reduced equation ,",
    "the nature of non - locality is such that the standard theory of integro - pde is not applicable to establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution . in this paper , to show well - posedness of this pde , a volterra integral equation(ie ) of the second kind is obtained and then the existence of a unique @xmath23 solution is shown . then it is proved that the solution to the ie is a classical solution to the pde under study .",
    "the uniqueness of the pde is proved by showing that any classical solution also solves the ie . in the uniqueness part , we use conditioning with respect to the transition times of the underlying process .",
    "besides , we also obtain the optimal portfolio selection as a continuous function of time and underlying switching process .",
    "the expression of this function does not involve the functional parameter @xmath7 .",
    "thus the optimal selection is robust .",
    "our approach of solving the pde also enables us to develop a robust numerical procedure to compute the optimal portfolio wealth using a quadrature method .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a rigorous description of the model of a financial market dynamics and then derive the wealth process of an investor s portfolio .",
    "the problem of optimizing the portfolio wealth under the risk sensitive criterion on the finite time horizon is also stated in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we have established a characterization of the optimal wealth using the corresponding hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation .",
    "an optimal portfolio strategy is also shown to exist in the class of markov feedback control . furthermore , an optimal feedback control is produced as a minimizer of a certain functional associated with the hjb equation .",
    "we illustrate the theoretical results by performing numerical experiments with an example and obtain some relevant results in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "the proofs of certain important lemmata are given in an appendix .",
