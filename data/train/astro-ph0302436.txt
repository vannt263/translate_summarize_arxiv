    "the onset of instability can typically be identified with a critical value of the non - dimensional parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath9 the gravitational potential energy .",
    "uniformly rotating , incompressible stars in newtonian theory are secularly unstable to bar - mode formation when @xmath10 .",
    "this instability can grow only in the presence of some dissipative mechanism , like viscosity or gravitational radiation , and the associated growth timescale is the dissipative timescale , which is usually much longer than the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "by contrast , a dynamical instability to bar - mode formation sets in when @xmath11 .",
    "this instability is independent of any dissipative mechanisms , and the growth time is the hydrodynamic timescale .",

    "once a bar has developed , the formation of a two - arm spiral plays an important role in redistributing the angular momentum and forming a core - halo structure . both @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "are smaller for stars with high degree of differential rotation @xcite .",
    "simulations in relativistic gravitation @xcite have shown that @xmath12 decreases with the compaction of the star , indicating that relativistic gravitation enhances the bar mode instability . in order to efficiently use computational resources ,",
    "most of these simulations have been performed under certain symmetry assumptions ( _ e.g. _ @xmath14-symmetry ) , which do not affect the growth of the @xmath3 bar mode , but which suppress any @xmath0 modes .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that such @xmath0 `` one - armed spiral '' modes are dynamically unstable at surprisingly small values of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite found this instability in evolutions of highly differentially rotating equilibrium polytropes with polytropic index @xmath15 . typically , these equilibria have a `` toroidal '' structure , so that the maximum density is not located at the geometric center but rather on a toroid rotating about the center .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath0 instability in equilibrium stars is related to that arising in protostellar disk systems .",
    "this instability originally was found in nearly keplerian , thin , gaseous disks around central point masses , both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite . the central point mass moves away from the center of mass of the whole system due to a perturbation and this displacement triggers the instability .",
    "this particular mode of instability only occurs when the mass ratio @xmath16 exceeds @xmath17 .",
    "an @xmath0 instability has also been found in thick , self - gravitating , protostellar tori @xcite and protostellar disks @xcite , as well as in finite fluid cores surrounded by disk halos @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the instability arises from the internal interaction between different regions of a single , continuous body , and the disk does not need to satisfy the above mass criterion to trigger the @xmath0 instability ( see also * ? ? ? * for an example of an unstable central accreting object surrounded by a rotationally supported gas disk ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study further the conditions under which a dynamical @xmath0 instability is excited .",
    "we vary both the polytropic index , i.e.  the stiffness of the equation of state , and the degree of differential rotation to isolate their effects on the instability .",
    "since the onset of rotational instabilities is often characterized by @xmath18 we keep this value approximately fixed in our sequences .",
    "we find that a soft equation of state and a high degree of differential rotation are both necessary to dynamically excite the @xmath0 mode at the small value of @xmath19 chosen in this paper .",
    "we find that a toroidal structure is not sufficient to trigger the @xmath0 instability , but our findings suggest that a toroidal structure may be necessary .",
    "while our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of the @xmath0 instability as opposed to simulating realistic astrophysical scenarios , we point out that there exist evolutionary sequences that may well lead to rapidly and highly differentially rotating configurations .",
    "for example , cooling by thermal emission from a rotating star will cause the star to contract and spin up .",
    "if internal viscosity and magnetic fields are sufficiently weak , this process will lead to differential rotation even if the initial configuration is rotating uniformly .",
    "this scenario may arise in supermassive stars , where the equation of state is dominated by radiation pressure and may be modeled by a ( soft ) @xmath20 polytrope . in the absence of viscosity and magnetic braking , the star will contract quasi - statically as it cools to a toroidal configuration , which may be subject to @xmath0 or @xmath3 instabilities @xcite .",
    "stellar collisions and mergers may also lead to differentially rotating stars .",
    "for the coalescence of binary neutron stars @xcite , the presence of differential rotation may temporarily stabilize the `` hypermassive '' remnant and may therefore have important dynamical effects @xcite . however , as we find in this paper , the @xmath0 mode is unstable only for very soft equations of state , so that it is not obvious that they will arise in the remnant of a binary neutron star merger .",
    "however , they may arise in a rapidly spinning proto - neutron star core when surrounded by a fall - back disk , possibly forming a low mass condensation which can explode and induce a large neutron star recoil speed @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 instability might arise in massive disks around black holes , especially if the disks are radiation - dominated , and hence governed by a soft equation of state .",

    "this characteristic is very different from what has been found for @xmath3 bar mode instabilities ( compare   [ subsec : m2test ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also find that the maximum wave amplitude is much smaller than can be found for configurations unstable to a pure bar mode ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : bargw ] ) as gravitational radiation requires a quadrupole distortion and the @xmath3 perturbation in models ii is only being excited as a lower - amplitude harmonic of the @xmath0 mode ( as suggested by a comparison of the pattern periods ; see table [ tab : pperiod1 ] ) .",
    "7.0 cm      we now focus on the dependence of the one - armed spiral instability on the degree of differential rotation . starting again with model i ( a ) , we now increase the parameter @xmath51 to explore more modest degrees of differential rotations . as",

    "[ fig : ddrtp ] ) . @xcite similarly found that the elimination of the toroidal structure is related to an outward transport of angular momentum . to quantify this effect , we monitored the angular momentum distribution in model iii(d ) by computing a mean radius of angular momentum @xmath82 } { j [ \\int dv \\rho \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] initially this mean radius is 1.1 , but increases to 1.5 at @xmath83 , indicating that in fact the @xmath0 mode transports angular momentum outward .",
    "we show gravitational waveforms from models iii in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddrgw ] .",
    "we again find that the amplitude decreases after reaching a maximum , which is a typical behavior of @xmath0 instability ( see table [ tab : pperiod1 ] that the pattern period of diagnostics @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the same ) . in some cases , however , this decrease is not monotonic , and the amplitude may increase again to form several distinct wave packets .",
    "our numerical data are not sufficient to determine the generic character of the gravitational waves emitted from @xmath0 instabilities , and we expect that this will be subject of future investigations .",
    "the problem is that the growth of central concentration during the evolution exceeds the ability of our code to resolve the innermost regions for arbitrary long times in all cases .",
    "we have studied the conditions under which newtonian , differentially rotating stars are dynamically unstable to an @xmath0 one - armed spiral instability , and found that both soft equations of state and a high degree of differential rotation are necessary to trigger the instability . for sufficiently soft equations of state and sufficiently high degrees of differential rotation we found that stars are dynamically unstable even at the small values of @xmath84 considered in this paper .    while we find that a toroidal structure alone is not sufficient for the @xmath0 instability , all the models that are unstable do have a toroidal structure , suggesting that this may be a necessary condition .",
    "the growing @xmath0 mode redistributes both matter and angular momentum in the unstable star and destroys the toroidal structure after a few central rotation periods .",
    "quasi - periodic gravitational waves emitted by stars with @xmath0 instabilities have smaller amplitudes than those emitted by stars unstable to the @xmath3 bar mode . for @xmath0 modes ,",
    "the gravitational radiation is emitted not by the primary mode itself , but by the @xmath3 secondary harmonic which is simultaneously excited , albeit at a lower amplitude ( see fig .  [",
