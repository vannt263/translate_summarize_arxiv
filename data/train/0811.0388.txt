    "quantum phase transitions in systems of itinerant fermions continue to attract considerable interest.@xcite on one hand this attention is due to the relevance of quantum critical points for understanding collective phenomena like high-@xmath1 superconductivity and other non - conventional properties of experimentally investigated compounds.@xcite on the other , it is related to peculiarities that so far prohibited the emergence of a fully convincing theoretical description of most systems exhibiting quantum criticality.@xcite    the standard approach in describing quantum critical phenomena in systems of itinerant fermions - the hertz - millis theory @xcite - relies on an order parameter field , which is introduced by a stratonovich - hubbard transformation . in a subsequent step",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "the resulting representation of the partition function as a path integral over a bosonic field is usually useful only provided the action may be expanded in the order parameter , and the relevant vertex functions can be evaluated for the values of momentum and frequency that correspond to the anticipated instability .",
    "the validity of such an expansion was questioned for both zero and finite momentum instabilities in the magnetic channel . in case of ferromagnetic transitions",
    "it was argued that the correct effective action involves additional terms @xcite leading to a first order transition , @xcite while for the case of antiferromagnetic transition in @xmath4 integrating out gapless fermionic modes can yield singular vertex functions all of which were argued to be marginal .",
    "@xcite despite these theoretical insufficiencies , hertz - millis theory is successful in explaining a number of nonconventional properties of many systems exhibiting quantum criticality .",
    "@xcite in recent years this theory was further extended to account for a number of systems not described by the original approach .",
    "these include metamagnetic quantum critical points,@xcite field - tuned quantum critical points where a term describing precession of the order parameter has to be retained in the action,@xcite and phase transitions induced by a nonequilibrium drive .",
    "@xcite    an interesting issue concerns the actual order of specific quantum phase transitions .",
    "hertz - millis theory by construction allows for continuous transitions only .",
    "however , microscopic models , which usually rely on fermionic degrees of freedom and meanfield - like treatment , often predict a first order scenario in case of both magnetic and charge instabilities occurring at @xmath5 , and for specific cases corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite theoretical studies of the interplay between first and second order scenarios are further motivated by experimental results , where the order of the quantum phase transitions in specific compounds is altered by varying external magnetic field @xmath7.@xcite upon increasing @xmath7 , the tricritical point separating the first order transition at @xmath8 from the second order at @xmath9 , is shifted towards lower values of @xmath10 and finally vanishes at @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the order of the transition at small @xmath10 can be controlled by varying @xmath7 .",
    "of particular interest is the case @xmath12 , where the transition is second order for all @xmath13 , but scaling behavior of physical quantities at low temperatures is in variance with that predicted by hertz - millis theory .",
    "@xcite an interesting scenario of quantum criticality occurs also in systems exhibiting a metamagnetic first order transition terminating with a critical end point.@xcite by tuning pressure the critical end point is suppressed to @xmath11 resulting in a distinct type of a quantum critical point .    in this work",
    "we investigate the possibility of altering the order of quantum phase transitions by order parameter fluctuations .",
    "subsequently , we study shapes of phase boundaries , focusing mainly on the cases where such change occurs .",
    "we rely on the conventional bosonic hertz action adapted to phases with broken symmetry and retaining also a @xmath0 term in the effective potential .",
    "we analyze two- and three- dimensional systems where discrete symmetry - breaking occurs at @xmath5 ( the dynamical exponent @xmath14 ) .",
    "our results should apply whenever an action of this type can be constructed .",
    "possible examples are magnetic transitions with ising - like symmetry and the so - called pomeranchuk instabilities @xcite where the discrete point - group lattice symmetry of the fermi surface is broken .",
    "for these transitions mean - field studies typically predict a first order scenario at @xmath11 but second order for slightly higher temperatures ( for @xmath9).@xcite we argue that the tricritical temperature is lowered by including the order - parameter fluctuations . under appropriate conditions the tricritical point",
    "may be suppressed to @xmath11 , in which case a quantum critical or tricritical point is realized .",
    "our study is based on the one - particle irreducible version of the functional renormalization group ( rg).@xcite this framework was applied extensively in the context of classical critical phenomena , where it yields a unified description of @xmath15-symmetric scalar models including systems in @xmath4.@xcite it also provides a suitable framework to treat quantum criticality.@xcite we apply the derivative expansion to quadratic order , and the effective potential is parametrized in a form allowing for the occurrence of both - first and second order transition .",
    "an advantage of the functional rg is that it allows control over effects occurring at different energy scales , and treatment of quantities that need not be universal .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the bare action to be applied in the rg procedure and provide a phase diagram of the unrenormalized theory . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the applied truncation of the functional rg flow equation and derive equations governing the evolution of quantities parametrizing the effective potential and the inverse propagator upon reducing the cutoff scale .",
    "iv is devoted to results obtained for the renormalized phase diagrams in the case @xmath11 . in sec .",
    "v we consider @xmath13 .",
    "we discuss the computed phase diagrams for cases where the phase transition is second order for @xmath13 and terminates at a quantum critical or tricritical point at @xmath11 .",
    "we also analyze the case where a tricritical point situated at @xmath13 occurs . for @xmath16 and a choice of system parameters corresponding to proximity to the quantum tricritical scenario",
    "we compute the crossovers of the shift exponent @xmath3 , characterizing the shape of the critical line , from the hertz - millis value @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "this latter value of the shift exponent is specific to quantum tricritical behavior in @xmath19 .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath20 is justified by invoking a scaling argument in sec .",
    "vi , where we also classify and discuss scaling regimes emergent from our analysis .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vii contains a summary of the work .",
    "in this study we rely on the conventional description of quantum critical points in systems of itinerant fermions in terms of the bosonic hertz action.@xcite this is derived by applying a stratonovich - hubbard transformation to the path - integral representation of the partition function of a fermionic system.@xcite this way the order - parameter field is introduced and the original fermionic degrees of freedom are decoupled allowing one to integrate them out .",
    "subsequently , one expands the resulting action in powers of the order - parameter field keeping only the most relevant dependence of the propagator on frequency and momentum , and neglecting this dependence in case of higher - order vertices . in the case of instabilities",

    "in this work we applied the @xmath0 model to analyze the effect of thermal and quantum fluctuations on the phase diagram of a system of itinerant fermions exhibiting a quantum phase transition at wavevector @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis is restricted to discrete symmetry breaking and relies on an effective bosonic action analogous to that proposed by hertz .",
    "@xcite renormalization of the action is computed from a system of flow equations derived by truncating the exact functional rg flow equation in the one particle irreducible scheme .",
    "the flow equations capture quantum and thermal fluctuations on equal footing and are applicable for @xmath59 in @xmath58 , also in the vicinity of the first or second order transition line .    by analyzing the renormalized phase diagram at @xmath11",
    "we find that a quantum critical point may be realized even if the bare action corresponds to a first order transition .",

    "the obtained decreasing form of @xmath158 implies enhancing the tendency towards a second order transition upon increasing the temperature .",
    "therefore , if the transition is first order at @xmath11 , it becomes second order at higher temperatures , namely for @xmath9 .",
    "we computed phase diagrams in the variables @xmath151 , where @xmath2 acts as a non - thermal control parameter . in @xmath4 and @xmath16",
    "we considered cases where the quantum phase transition is first ( @xmath162 ) and second ( @xmath161 ) order . in the former situation ,",
    "the phase boundaries in @xmath58 show linear behavior in the vicinity of @xmath11 , where the slope in @xmath4 is infinite ( or very large ) .",
    "approximately linear behavior of the @xmath1-line is also recovered for @xmath161 in @xmath4 .",
    "subsequently , we analyzed the case @xmath161 in @xmath16 .",
    "numerical computations of the @xmath1 line for different choices of @xmath40 reveal that the phase boundary follows a power law with the shift exponent @xmath198 , as predicted by millis , @xcite as long as @xmath40 is separated from @xmath191 . upon decreasing @xmath40 towards @xmath191 , the region in the phase diagram , where this scaling is observed shrinks .",
    "this is accompanied by formation of a different scaling region ( at slightly higher @xmath10 ) , where @xmath226 .",
    "when @xmath243 the quantum critical point is replaced by a quantum tricritical point and the shape of the whole transition line in the vicinity of @xmath11 is described by @xmath20 .",
    "these observations are understood by invoking scaling analysis relying on mean - field like assumption , by which the ginzburg and transition lines in the vicinity of the quantum critical point are identified with each other . by deriving a formula for @xmath3 as function of the dynamical exponent @xmath233 and scaling dimension",

    "one could then check , in what conditions quantum criticality ( and tricriticality ) induced by order parameter fluctuations is conceivable , i.e. one encounters @xmath245 in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "an interesting candidate for such a study is the so called @xmath246-model @xcite of discrete symmetry - breaking fermi surface deformations , for which @xmath14 , and which for small @xmath10 and within mean field approximation , exhibits a phase diagram qualitatively similar to the one obtained here in fig .
