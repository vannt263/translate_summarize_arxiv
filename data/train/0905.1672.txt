    "the study of the commensurability classes of hyperbolic knot complements that contain other knot complements has attracted some recent interest ( see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "for example , the @xmath2 pretzel knot of @xcite famously admits two non - trivial cyclic surgeries and is therefore covered by two other hyperbolic knot complements .",
    "an infinite family of pairs of commensurable hyperbolic knot complements was constructed by w. neuman .    for a discussion of this construction , see @xcite .",
    "finally , two hyperbolic knot complements can be commensurable if they both have hidden symmetries .",
    "this property is equivalent to both knot complements non - normally covering the same orbifold ( see @xmath3 [ prelim_cusps ] ) .",
    "the dodecahedral knots of @xcite admit the only known examples of non - arithmetic knot complements with hidden symmetries ( see @xcite ) and the figure 8 knot complement is the only arithmetic knot complement ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this discussion motivates the following conjecture of reid and walsh ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the berge manifold admits several surgery slopes of interest .",
    "first if we perform dehn surgery along the @xmath51 slope of the unknotted cusp of the berge manifold , we will obtain the @xmath2 pretzel knot ( see @xcite ) . also ,",

    "in fact , it is well known that the @xmath51 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 surgery slopes on the @xmath2 pretzel knot admit lens space surgeries ( see @xcite ) . by drilling out the unknotted cusp of the berge manifold ,",
    "these are also the surgery slopes that produce a solid torus filling . since the linking number of the knotted cusp and the unknotted cusp is @xmath57 , the longitude gets sent to the curve @xmath58 after @xmath53 dehn surgery on the unknotted cusp while the meridian @xmath51 remains fixed ( see ( * ? ? ? * sect 9.h ) ) .",

    "thus , the covering of @xmath77 by the berge manifold is of order @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "now , @xmath84 ( see @xcite ) and since @xmath85 , we have that @xmath86 .",

    "each orbifold @xmath117 @xmath118 resulting from one of these dehn surgeries has underlying space a lens space with @xmath119 finite cyclic .    in fact , @xmath120 is distinct for each choice of @xmath121 . to see this",
    "we observe , as noted above , that @xmath117 is an orbifold with underlying space a lens space .",
