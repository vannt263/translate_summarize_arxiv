    "a few decades ago , a new topic in meson physics drew the attention of intermediate energy nuclear physicists .",
    "this was due to the finding that the interaction between the eta meson ( @xmath4 ) and a nucleon is strongly attractive @xcite and that this interaction may generate sufficient attraction to give rise to an exotic bound state ( also referred to as  quasibound \" since it decays within a short time ) when put in the nuclear environment .",
    "the prediction for the existence of such eta - mesic nuclei initiated lots of efforts on the experimental as well as the theoretical front @xcite . due to the lack of eta beams (",
    "as the eta meson is extremely short lived ) , experiments where the @xmath4 was produced in the final state with protons and photons incident on nuclei , were performed .",
    "however , apart from two controversial experiments @xcite , there has been no definite evidence for the existence of these states .",
    "meanwhile , the interest has also shifted from @xmath4 to @xmath5 mesic nuclei @xcite . however , the wasa group @xcite is still active in the search for eta - mesic states in light nuclei ( see also @xcite for theoretical works on eta - mesic helium nuclei ) .",
    "many a time in physics , an experimental finding is not a direct measurement but rather a result deduced from the analysis of experimental data using theoretical inputs . for example , nuclear radii are not  measured \" but rather extracted @xcite using theoretical relations involving electromagnetic form factors of nuclei which are deduced from data on electron - nucleus scattering .",
    "the experimental searches for eta - mesic nuclei involve certain assumptions and theoretical inputs too .",
    "one of the ( sufficiently justified ) assumption is that the interaction of the @xmath4 meson with the nucleus proceeds through the formation of the s11 n@xmath0(1535 ) resonance .",
    "hence , analyses of an anticipated eta mesic nucleus , model the eta - nucleon interaction to proceed via the formation of an n*(1535 ) resonance which repeatedly decays , regenerates and propagates within the nucleus until it eventually decays into a free meson and a nucleon .",
    "the search for an @xmath2he-@xmath4 bound state which for example involves the analysis of the @xmath6he @xmath7 reaction data , is performed by assuming that the reaction proceeds as follows @xcite : @xmath8he-@xmath9he - n@xmath10 @xmath1he @xmath11 .",
    "thus it becomes necessary to incorporate the static properties and motion of the n@xmath0 resonance inside the nucleus .",
    "one essential ingredient in these analyses is the relative momentum distribution of n@xmath0-@xmath1he inside the @xmath2he nucleus ( which contains an n@xmath0 in place of one proton or neutron ) .",
    "this distribution is necessary to establish the detector system acceptance for the registration of the @xmath12he - n@xmath10 @xmath1he @xmath11 reaction and to determine the data selection criteria @xcite .",
    "however , with the knowledge of the n@xmath0 interaction with nucleons not being sufficient ( see however the discussion in the next section ) , it is common to use the momentum distribution of a nucleon inside the nucleus rather than that of the resonance .",
    "in fact , even though the momentum distributions inside nuclei provide information which is complementary to that obtained from electromagnetic form factors , much less experimental information is available on the former even in normal nuclei .    in the present work , a model for the evaluation of the momentum distribution of an n@xmath0 inside a nucleus",
    "is presented . in a recent work @xcite , the possibility for the existence of broad n@xmath0-nucleus ( quasi)bound states",
    "was proposed using some available sets of coupling constants for the n n@xmath0 @xmath13 n n@xmath0 interaction . since a few bound states in the n@xmath0-@xmath1he and n@xmath0-@xmath3 mg",
    "were indeed predicted , in this work we use these binding energies ( as well as some others obtained by varying the coupling constants ) to evaluate the momentum distribution of the n@xmath0 resonance in these nuclei . in the next section , we shall briefly repeat the formalism used in @xcite and proceed further to describe the evaluation of the momentum distributions .",
    "an interesting outcome of these investigations is that the momentum distribution of an n@xmath0 resonance inside a nucleus is narrower than that of a nucleon inside a nucleus",
    ". this fact could indeed be of significant importance in the analyses done in connection with the searches for eta - mesic nuclei .",
    "though the existence of a bound state of a baryon resonance and a nucleus is by itself an exotic idea , it has indeed been explored in context with the @xmath14 ( spin - isopsin 3/2 ) resonance @xcite in the past . in @xcite , the author calculated the momentum distribution of such a resonance too .",
    "as compared to the @xmath14 , the case of the n@xmath0(1535 ) resonance is relatively simpler .",
    "it is a spin 1/2 ( negative parity ) s11 resonance which decays dominantly into a nucleon and a pion or eta meson .",
    "hence , we shall use a one meson exchange n n@xmath15 n n@xmath0 interaction with the exchange of a @xmath16 and @xmath4 meson .",
    "the n@xmath0-nucleus potential is then obtained by folding the elementary n n@xmath0 interaction with a nuclear density ( see some remarks regarding the validity of the folding model in this work , above eq.([potn ] ) ) .",
    "we shall also retain the scalar part of the interaction only .",
    "since the n@xmath0(1535 ) is a negative parity baryon , indeed in the one - pion and -eta exchange diagrams , the spin dependent terms are suppressed as compared to the leading scalar terms .    as for the @xmath16nn@xmath0 and",
    "@xmath4nn@xmath0 coupling constants , there appears a range of values in literature @xcite . in the first reference in @xcite , for example",
    ", the cross sections for photoproduction of @xmath4 mesons from heavy nuclei were measured and compared with models of the quasifree @xmath17 reaction .",
    "the authors adjusted the coupling constants from an effective lagrangian approach ( ela ) in @xcite to reproduce the @xmath18 and @xmath19 data . with @xmath20 = 0.699 and",
    "@xmath21 = 2.005 , the experimental @xmath4 photoproduction cross sections on complex nuclei were reproduced within the model of @xcite . in the two references in @xcite , the authors found @xmath20",
    "= 0.8 and @xmath21 = 2.22 while comparing the calculations within a one boson exchange model with the @xmath22 and @xmath23 data .",
    "somewhat bigger values of the @xmath24 coupling constant have been found in more recent years with ref .",
    "@xcite for example , reporting @xmath20 = 1.09 by comparing calculations within a chiral constituent quark model with the experimental data on the partial decay width of the s11(1535 ) resonance . mixing pseudoscalar meson - baryon with vector meson - baryon states in a coupled channels scheme with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the coupling constants , @xmath20 = 1.05 and @xmath21",
    "= 1.6 were obtained in @xcite . in a study of nonstrange meson baryon systems",
    "where the n*(1535 ) was found to get generated as a result of coupled channel dynamics of vector meson - baryon and pseudoscalar - baryon systems , the authors @xcite obtain , @xmath20 = 0.95 and @xmath21 = 1.77 .",
    "we shall present results with some sets of coupling constants mentioned above .",
    "the constants and binding energies of possible n@xmath0-@xmath1he states are listed in table i. as compared to the @xmath16n n@xmath0 and @xmath4n n@xmath0 couplings , the @xmath16n@xmath0n@xmath0 and @xmath4n@xmath0n@xmath0 couplings are even much less known . in view of the above uncertainties and also the fact that the present work is aimed at finding out how much the n@xmath0 momentum distribution in a nucleus differs from that of a nucleon , we do not attempt a more sophisticated calculation .      the elementary interaction is considered to proceed by the exchange of a pion and an eta meson as shown in fig .",
    "1 . we consider an n@xmath0 which is neutral .",
    "the calculation for a positively charged n@xmath0 can be repeated in a similar way .",
    "elementary n n@xmath0 @xmath13 n n@xmath0 processes considered in the interaction of the n@xmath0 with a nucleus.,width=453,height=188 ]    diagrams involving the n@xmath0n@xmath31 or n@xmath0n@xmath32 couplings which are hardly known will not be considered .",
    "apart from this fact , for such diagrams , the potential turns out to be spin dependent ( and so also suppressed as compared to the leading term in the potential of fig .",
    "1 ) .    the @xmath16nn@xmath0 and @xmath4nn@xmath0 couplings ( with n@xmath0(1535,1/2@xmath33 ) ) are given by the following interaction hamiltonians @xcite : @xmath34 let us consider the diagram for the n@xmath0 n @xmath13 n n@xmath0 process in fig .",
    "1 and use the standard feynman diagram rules with the non - relativistic approximation for the spinors @xmath35 to write the amplitude as @xmath36 where @xmath37 or @xmath4 and @xmath38 is the four momentum squared carried by the exchanged meson ( @xmath39 as shown in the figure ) . here for example , @xmath40 and we drop the second term in the brackets which is spin dependent as well as @xmath41 suppressed .",
    "the potential in momentum space obtained from the above amplitude is given as : @xmath42 where the last term in brackets has been introduced to take into account the off - shellness of the exchanged meson .",
    "the four momentum transfer squared , @xmath43 , in the present calculation is approximated simply as @xmath44 . since the mass of the n@xmath0 is much bigger than that of the nucleon , the neglect of the energy transfer , @xmath45 , in the elastic n n@xmath46 n n@xmath0 process as such is not well justified .",
    "however we do not expect the relative momentum distribution of the n@xmath0 in the nucleus to depend strongly on the mass of the n@xmath0 ( an expectation which will be verified later numerically ) .",
    "we thus proceed further without a non - zero @xmath45 which would give rise to poles in ( [ pot1 ] ) and make the calculation of the n@xmath0 nucleus potential a formidable task .",
    "the potential in ( [ pot1 ] ) is fourier transformed to obtain the potential in @xmath47-space .",
    "the fourier transform of ( [ pot1 ] ) can be calculated analytically and we get , @xmath48\\ , .\\ ] ] in order to evaluate the above potential , we need to know the coupling constants at the @xmath16nn@xmath0 and @xmath4nn@xmath0 vertices .",
    "one can find a range of values in literature as discussed above . in fig .",
    "2 , we see the sensitivity of these potentials to the use of different sets of parameters . whereas the first two sets are shown to display the sensitivity to the values of the cut - off parameters , the next set is the one which gives the highest binding of the n@xmath0 and nuclei in this work .",
    "it gives rise to one bound n@xmath0-@xmath1he state at -4.78 mev and 3 bound n@xmath0-@xmath3 mg states at -50.3 , -22.5 and -3.25 mev .",
    "using this as well as other sets listed in table i , we perform an exploratory study of the momentum distributions of the n@xmath0 .     elementary potential as given in eq.([potelement ] ) . note that whereas @xmath49 exchange contributes to the n n@xmath15 n n@xmath0 potential , only @xmath16 contributes to the p n@xmath15 p n@xmath0 potential in n@xmath0-@xmath1he.,width=340,height=415 ]      once the elementary potential has been defined , the folding model with @xmath50 is used to construct the n@xmath0 nucleus potential @xmath51 which is given by @xmath52 where , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the number of protons and neutrons , @xmath55 and due to the isospin factor appearing in the @xmath56 exchange diagram ( see fig . 1 and eq.([hamil ] ) ) , @xmath57 .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath1he with @xmath58 and due to the isospin factor in @xmath59 , the contribution of @xmath60 to the total @xmath51 is much larger than that of @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath59 ( and hence @xmath60 ) involves only the pion exchange diagram ( fig .",
    "1[b ] ) , the dominant contribution to the n@xmath0-nucleus potential comes from pion exchange .",
    "since the pion exchange potential is fairly long range , the folding model chosen in the present work , though not ideal , seems acceptable .    after performing the angle integration , the above integral reduces for example to @xmath62    \\,\\biggr \\}\\ , r \\ , dr\\ , \\rho_n(r ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    in case of the @xmath1he nucleus",
    ", the majority of information available in literature is on the charge density distribution of @xmath1he obtained from electron scattering .",
    "the root mean square radius , @xmath65 = 1.88 @xmath66 0.05 fm , obtained in @xcite from the @xmath67he charge form factor is a bit smaller than the value of 1.959 @xmath66 0.03 fm in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also provides the charge form factor of @xmath1h with @xmath68 = 1.755 @xmath66 0.086 fm .",
    "there exists a parametrization of the matter density given in @xcite where a folding model analysis of @xmath1he elastic scattering on heavy nuclei is performed .",
    "the authors fit the parameters in a gaussian density to reproduce a @xmath1he matter radius of 1.68 fm ( calculated as @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the radius of the proton ) .",
    "there is however no direct experimental data for the neutron density distribution in @xmath1he .",
    "we identify the neutron density distribution in @xmath1he with the proton density in @xmath1h , which not only seems reasonable provided that the charge symmetry breaking is small but also agrees with the matter distribution given in @xcite .",
    "such an approach of calculating the nuclear densities using the charge densities of @xmath1he and @xmath1h has also been used earlier in literature @xcite .",
    "thus , for the proton density distribution @xmath71 , we choose a sum of gaussians @xcite , namely , @xmath72 where the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath1he and @xmath1h can be found in @xcite .",
    "thus , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( both normalized to 1 ) , the above integral can in principle be done analytically .",
    "however , the analytic results are lengthy expressions which include error functions and exponentials .",
    "they are not particularly enlightening and hence we rather perform the integral numerically . the density for @xmath3 mg is assumed to have the following woods - saxon form @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79 $ ] with @xmath80 fm and @xmath81 .",
    "the n@xmath0 nuclear potentials thus evaluated ( see @xcite ) can be fitted reasonably well to woods saxon forms of potentials .",

    "though the momentum distribution for @xmath107-@xmath1he is not expected to be very different from that of @xmath108-@xmath1h in @xmath2he , we perform this calculation in order to compare with the available few - body results . with the woods",

    "the broad s11 baryon resonance n@xmath0(1535 ) enters as one of the most essential ingredient in reactions involving the production of the neutral pseudoscalar eta meson ( @xmath4 ) and hence also in the analyses of possible eta - mesic nuclei .",
    "since the low energy @xmath4n interaction predominantly proceeds by producing an n@xmath0 resonance which propagates , decays and regenerates inside the nucleus , it seems legitimate to ponder about the possible existence of an n@xmath0-nucleus bound state too .",
    "indeed , performing such an investigation in @xcite , it was found that depending on the strength of the n n@xmath0 interaction , loosely bound , broad quasibound states of the n@xmath0 with @xmath1he and @xmath3 mg nuclei can be formed . in the present work ,",
    "the investigation is continued to evaluate the momentum distribution of such an n@xmath0 inside the nucleus .",
    "being aware of the fact that neither does any experimental evidence of n@xmath0-nuclei exist nor is the n n@xmath0 interaction accurately known , the calculations are done within a folding model where the elementary n n@xmath0 @xmath13 n n@xmath0 potential is folded with the known nuclear densities .",
    "the present work finds that since the n@xmath0 is loosely ( or even very loosely , depending on the @xmath16nn@xmath0 and @xmath4nn@xmath0 couplings ) bound to a nucleus , the bound state wave function of an n@xmath0 as compared to that of a nucleon is more spread out in @xmath47-space and hence the momentum distribution is narrower than in case of the nucleon .",
    "this finding is important in view of the fact that experimental analyses generally approximate the momentum distribution of an n@xmath0 by that of a nucleon in a nucleus .",
    "the present work is a first attempt to evaluate the n@xmath0(1535 ) resonance momentum distribution in nuclei .",
    "this distribution , as mentioned in the beginning , is necessary to establish the detector system acceptance for the registration of the @xmath12he - n@xmath10 @xmath1he @xmath11 reaction and to determine the data selection criteria @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the momentum distribution of n@xmath0-d in @xmath1he would be necessary for the analysis of the @xmath113-n@xmath10 d @xmath11 reaction aimed at searching @xmath4-mesic @xmath1he whose prospects seem higher due to the fact that we have already seen a strong enhancement in the @xmath114he @xmath4 reaction near threshold . such a calculation would however be better performed using a few body formalism for the n@xmath0-p - n system .",
    "an improved knowledge of the n@xmath0 coupling constants and experimental searches of n@xmath0 nuclei could motivate such sophisticated few body calculations in future .",

    "<S> due to its dominance in the low energy eta - nucleon interaction , the s11 n@xmath0(1535 ) resonance enters as an important ingredient in the analyses of experiments aimed at finding evidence for the existence of eta - mesic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the static properties of the resonance get modified inside the nucleus and its momentum distribution is used in deciding these properties as well as the kinematics in the analyses . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that given the possibility for the existence of an n@xmath0-@xmath1he quasibound state , the relative momentum distribution of an n@xmath0 and @xmath1he inside such a @xmath2he is narrower than that of neutron-@xmath1he in @xmath2he . </S>",
    "<S> results for the n@xmath0-@xmath3 mg system are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> the present exploratory work could be useful in motivating searches of exotic n@xmath0-nucleus quasibound states as well as in performing analyses of eta meson production data .    </S>",
