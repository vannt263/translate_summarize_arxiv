    "the origin for the dramatic slowing down of the relaxation dynamics of a liquid close to the glass transition is still a matter of debate  @xcite .",
    "different theoretical approaches to describe the dynamic transition from the liquid to the glassy state have been presented so far .",
    "some concentrate on thermodynamic aspects and propose a first or second order phase transition ( e.g. free volume theory  @xcite or entropy models  @xcite ) , while others , such as mode - coupling theory  @xcite , focus on the microscopic dynamics that shows non - linear feedback effects which are responsible for the slow dynamics .",
    "many of these theories are using in some form the concept of cooperative motion within a liquid . as already mentioned by kauzmann  @xcite it is reasonable to assume that in a liquid neighboring particles can not move independently of each other , in particular at low temperatures .",
    "instead one must expect that the motion of two particles that are separated by a distance that is short is cooperative , i.e. there exist cooperatively rearranging regions ( crr s ) within the liquid .",
    "however , how this cooperative motion is realized microscopically is not that clear .",
    "e.g. one can discuss the motion of the particles by means of the so called cage effect  @xcite : a liquid particle is surrounded by its nearest neighbors , which form a cage . at low temperatures this cage is quite rigid and therefore at short and intermediate times a particle will mainly rattle around within this cage . for longer times the cage will open up and allow the particle to escape . with decreasing temperature",
    "this opening will take more and more time , and hence the relaxation dynamics of the particles will slow down .",
    "the cage effect already includes the concept of cooperativity since other particles have to move as well before the cage breaks up and the trapped particle can escape .    under the assumption that there is some kind of cooperativity within the liquid",
    "the next question is whether the size of such crr s does indeed increase with decreasing temperature , as proposed in several models for the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "usual thermodynamic second order phase transitions , who also show a strong slowing down of the dynamics , are accompanied by the divergence of some static length scale . while in spin glasses higher order correlation functions",
    "do show a divergence  @xcite , no diverging _",
    "static _ length scale has been found so far in structural glasses .",
    "the analysis of two point correlations such as the structure factors or radial distribution functions shows that the length scales involved are hardly growing with decreasing temperature . in particular",
    ", the structure of a glass is almost identical to the one of a liquid . on the other hand",
    "there has been evidence for the existence of _ dynamic _ length scales which grow much faster , although evidence for a divergence at some finite critical temperature has been given only very recently  @xcite .",
    "e.g. computer simulations  @xcite and measurements on colloidal systems  @xcite have shown that the dynamics is heterogeneous .",
    "it was found , that the fastest particles within the system are not distributed randomly but tend to form clusters .",
    "the size of these clusters grows on lowering the temperature although by a factor that is much smaller than the increase found in typical structural relaxation times  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the precise connection between heterogenous and cooperative dynamics is a question that is still open .    since in most experimental setups it is not possible to access directly the dynamics of the individual particles , people have proposed and used methods to study the cooperative dynamics in supercooled liquids in an indirect way",
    "the idea is to investigate _ confined _ systems and thus to introduce a new length scale , the thickness of the film or the diameter of the pore , and to see how this scale influences the relaxation dynamics .",
    "if crr s do exist and grow with decreasing temperature , the dynamics should differ from the bulk behavior as soon as the size of the crr s at a given temperature becomes comparable to the system size  @xcite .",
    "one large class of experiments are done on molecular liquids ( such as salol , glycol , ortho - terphenyl ) confined to porous material such as vycor glass , sol - gel glass and zeolithes with pore sizes ranging from several hundred to only a few nanometer .",
    "typical experimental methods are differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc )  @xcite , dielectric spectroscopy  @xcite , neutron scattering  @xcite , solvation dynamics  @xcite and many more .",
    "as expected , most experimental data show a deviation from bulk behavior below a certain threshold temperature .",
    "the main problem with these experiments is the correct interpretation of the results , which is not at all universal  @xcite .",
    "depending on the investigated liquid , the realization of the confinement and even the experimental method , there is a great variety in experimental findings .",
    "some give evidence for an accelerated dynamics in confinement  @xcite , i.e. the glass transition temperature @xmath3 goes down , while others see an increase of @xmath3  @xcite .    in many cases in which the dynamics is slowed down ,",
    "experimental spectra suggest the existence of a secondary relaxation process and often the interpretation of this result is based on the interaction between liquid and surface .",
    "the idea is that there is an immobile particle layer which is bound to the surface ( slow process ) and the remaining liquid is then often accelerated with respect to the bulk  @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of supported and free standing polymer films by ellipsometry  @xcite supports this interpretation . while free standing films show a systematic decrease of @xmath3 with decreasing thickness , the dynamics is partially slowed down in the presence of an attractive surface ( e.g. in supported films ) .",
    "the experimental data can be described by a simple three layer model  @xcite , where one distinguishes between surface layers for supported and free interfaces and a liquid like layer at larger distance from the interface .",
    "other general trends found in experiments include a broadening of the @xmath4relaxation peaks in dielectric  @xcite but also in neutron scattering  @xcite experiments .",
    "as mentioned above , an important input parameter , which however is hard to control in many experiments , is the interaction between surface and liquid and the local structure .",
    "if the liquid is bound to the surface the mobility is of course reduced and due to the existence of cooperativity this slowing down could also propagate further into the system .",
    "the opposite effect is seen , if the particle mobility is enhanced close to the interface .",
    "furthermore it is also important to know the precise geometry of the confining material .",
    "e.g. in vycor glass one could think of a distribution of different pore sizes which leads to a superposition of relaxation processes on slightly different time scales which could explain the broadening of the relaxation peak for the whole system .    since in an experiment",
    "only the _ average _ particle density can be controlled , it is always possible that the _ local _ structure shows strong deviations from bulk behavior , such as , e.g. , density oscillations .",
    "lower local densities should of course accelerate the dynamics and vice versa . that such oscillation in the density do indeed occur is a result of many computer simulations of confined liquids  @xcite .",
    "depending on the investigated liquid and the surface interaction , the amplitude of such oscillations can be very large  @xcite , but there are also situations where the density is almost constant  @xcite .",
    "thus it is not very clear so far whether the change of the relaxation dynamics of confined systems is a real effect of the confinement , or whether it is just a `` secondary '' effect , i.e. due to the interaction of the liquid with the surface and hence the resulting change in structure and thus in the dynamics .",
    "since in principle computer simulations offer the possibility to control the most important input parameters such as the geometry of the confinement and the interactions with the surface , and furthermore allow to investigate the relaxation dynamics also on a local scale , they are an ideal method to study the dynamics of confined systems and in the present paper we report the results of such a study . in our simulation",
    "we realize a situation where the static properties are _ identical _ to the one in the bulk and therefore the dynamics is not influenced by `` secondary '' effects coming from a different structure .",
    "thus this helps to obtain a better understanding of the relaxation dynamics of such confined systems and also to interpret some experimental findings .    in the following we",
    "first introduce a model for the investigated liquid and the implementation of a rough wall with an amorphous structure .",
    "subsequently we investigate the dynamic properties using as observables the mean squared displacement and the intermediate scattering function .",
    "we characterize the influence of the wall on the local particle dynamics and extract length scales of cooperativity from the structural relaxation times .",
    "finally we discuss finite size effects which show up only at low temperatures or for very thin films , and analyze the average relaxation dynamics , i.e. the only quantities that are accessible in a real experiment .",
    "we investigate a binary mixture of 80% a and 20% b particles that interact via a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath5 $ ] ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the interaction parameters are chosen as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . the potential is truncated and shifted at cut - off radii @xmath13@xmath14 . within this paper",
    "all results will be given in reduced lj units , i.e. length in units of @xmath15 , energy in units of @xmath16 , and time in units of @xmath17 .",
    "the introduction of two different length scales for the size of the particles strongly suppresses the crystallization of the liquid at low temperatures .",
    "previous simulations in the bulk have shown that this system is a very good glass - former , i.e. is not prone to crystallisation  @xcite . as a reference for the relevant temperature scale",
    "we note that the system is in a normal liquid state for @xmath18 , that the critical temperature of the mode - coupling theory  @xcite is around 0.435 , and that the kauzmann temperature is around 0.3  @xcite    the equations of motion have been integrated with the velocity form of the verlet algorithm , using a step size of 0.01 and 0.02 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . during",
    "these runs the accessible volume to the particles was keep constant .    as already mentioned in the introduction , it is most important to be able to decide whether the change in the relaxation dynamics is due to the _ confinement _ or whether it is related to the _ interaction _ of the fluid particles with the wall , i.e. a change of the local structure close to the wall . since in the present work",
    "we want to study only the influence of the confinement on the dynamics , we have to avoid a change of the structural properties due to the confining walls .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a simulation of a liquid confined in a tube in which the positions of the wall particles were given by a frozen configuration of the same liquid at a _ fixed _ temperature @xmath21 ( which corresponded to a temperature at which the bulk liquid was slightly supercooled ) .",
    "since the structure of the wall was thus almost identical to the enclosed liquid in its bulk phase , the difference of the structure of the confined liquid from the one of the bulk was fairly small . nevertheless , due to the slightly different structure , the confined liquid was not quite in equilibrium after the introduction of the walls and hence it was necessary to equilibrate the confined system . due to the strong slowing down of the confined liquid close to the wall , this equilibration took a very long time and hence it was possible to access only intermediate temperatures , i.e. the relaxation dynamics of the confined system at low temperatures could not be studied .",
    "it is , however , possible to avoid this problem by setting the `` wall temperature '' @xmath21 , i.e. the temperature at which this configuration was equilibrated , identical to the temperature of the contained liquid  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite the wall structure is now also a ( weak ) function of temperature .",
    "furthermore it is necessary to add a hard core potential directly at the interface in order to prevent that the fluid particles penetrate into the wall . in the following",
    "we will briefly demonstrate that with this setup the structure of the confined liquid is indeed identical to the one of the bulk system .",
    "although we will restrict ourself to the situation in which the liquid is confined between two parallel plane walls , the derivation can easily be expanded to an arbitrary confining geometry . due to this fact it is hence not necessary to equilibrate the liquid and thus the above mentioned problem is avoided .",
    "consider a static variable @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a @xmath24-dimensional vector that characterizes the position of all particles in a bulk system . in the canonical ensemble the expectation value of the observable @xmath25",

    "we have found that at low temperatures the relaxation dynamics shows strong finite size effects , see section  [ sec3f ] .",
    "therefore we restricted our investigations to the temperature range @xmath58 for which such effects are not present .",
    "the remarkable advantage of the just discussed method to confine the liquid is that we only have to equilibrate bulk systems where relaxation times are orders of magnitude smaller than in films with rough surfaces  @xcite .",
    "of course the production run has to be much longer than the equilibration runs in order to investigate the structural relaxation also close to the surface .",
    "a remaining problem is the realization of the average over the different walls , see eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) . in practice",
    "we calculated this mean by averaging over 16 independent walls , a number that , for the system sizes used in the present simulation , turned out to be sufficient .",
    "in particular we found that the average particle density as a function of @xmath0 is a constant , as it has to be for a homogeneous system and that structural quantities like the partial structure factors are identical to the ones in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "since we already know from previous simulations that the dynamic properties will strongly depend on the particle distance @xmath0 from the wall  @xcite we will concentrate on observables that take into account this spatial dependence . in particular we will investigate the single particle dynamics such as mean squared displacements and the self part of the van hove correlation functions .",
    "subsequently we will use the decay of density fluctuations to extract characteristic relaxation times and study their temperature dependence .",
    "finally we will study collective quantities and dynamic properties averaged over all particles .",

    "the bulk curves show a @xmath72 dependence since on that time scale the particles move just ballistically . at high",
    "@xmath73 this time dependence crosses over immediately to the diffusive regime , i.e. the msd increases linearly with time .",
    "the same short and long time behavior is found also at low @xmath73 .",
    "however , we see that at these temperatures the two regimes are separated by a time - window in which the msd increases only slowly .",
    "the physical reason for this behavior is the so - called `` cage - effect '' , i.e. the fact that at intermediate times the particles are temporarily trapped by their surrounding neighbors .",
    "this time window is often also called `` @xmath74relaxation ''  @xcite .",
    "the curves for the confined system for particles that are in the center of the film ( thin lines ) are basically identical to the one of the bulk system , showing that for large distances from the wall the relaxation dynamics is not changed .",
    "this is in contrast to the dynamics of the particles close to the walls , dotted lines , which seems to be significantly slower than the one of the bulk . already at high temperatures we see that the msd has a weak plateau at intermediate times , thus demonstrating that the cage - effect is already present",
    "this becomes much more pronounced if the temperature is lowered .",
    "e.g. we find that at @xmath71 the msd for the smallest @xmath0 shows a plateau that extends over several decades in time and only at the very end of the run the particles start to show a diffusive behavior .",
    "( note that at very long times the msd for the different values of @xmath0 must come together since ultimately the system will be ergodic and hence the dynamical properties of a particle can not depend on its location at time zero .",

    "it can be expected , however , that the relaxation dynamics is not isotropic and that therefore it is of interest to investigate also the component of the motion perpendicular to the wall .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig_msd_isotropy ] where we show for two temperatures and two values of @xmath0 the components @xmath68 and @xmath65 . from this graph",

    "this is , however , not the case in that both components show a significantly slower @xmath82dependence than the one of the bulk .",
    "furthermore we see that the relaxation in @xmath0 direction is at intermediate time scales slower than the one in @xmath83 direction .",
    "also the size of the cage in @xmath0 direction is significantly smaller than the one in @xmath83 direction , as can be recognized by the fact that the height of the plateau at intermediate times is smaller for @xmath65 than the one seen in @xmath68 .",
    "this observation is related to the fact that the particles of the wall are completely frozen , i.e. do not oscillate around an `` equilibrium '' position , and hence are not able to make space for the vibrations of the fluid particles .",
    "in order to investigate the relaxation dynamics of the particles in more detail it is useful to investigates not only their averaged displacements but their distribution at different times , i.e. to study the self part of the van hove correlation function  @xcite . also here",

    "figure [ fig_vanhove_layerdependence]b shows that for a time in which the bulk system is in the @xmath74relaxation regime , the van hove function does depend strongly on the distance from the wall . for large values of @xmath0 , and",

    "this means that these particles have left the cage in which they were at time @xmath62 .",

    "we conclude that the responsible mechanism is a jump type of motion , i.e. these particles do not move continuously but hop to a new position that has a typical distance 1.0 from the initial site . in the bulk system",
    "such a hopping motion has been observed only for the b particles and even this only at very low temperature  @xcite . in general such type of relaxation dynamics",
    "is more characteristic for strong glass formers , such as , e.g. , silica  @xcite . in these systems",
    "the typical `` jump distance '' corresponds to the first peak in the radial distribution function and it is possible to recognize even the existence of peaks of higher order and which correspond to subsequent jumps .",
    "the reason why the confined system shows a hopping motion that is not present in the bulk system is related to the presence of the walls .",
    "since these walls consist of immobile particles they give rise to a ( static ! ) local potential energy landscape with energy minima for positions in between those particles and the observed jumps are just the motion of the particles between these local minima .",
    "note that these jumps are not necessarily parallel to the surface and are not confined to the first layer of the fluid since they are also observed for particles that are in the second and third layer ( see fig .",

    "is part of the cage of other particles , a decrease in @xmath73 , i.e. a stronger coupling of the motion , leads to a strong ( i.e. non - linear ) stiffening of the cage ( feedback effect ) . in our case the particles that form the wall",
    "are completely frozen and thus they do no longer participate to help to relax the fluid particles in their neighborhood .",
    "thus from a qualitative point of view the lack of fluctuations of the cage of the particles near the walls explains the slowing down of their dynamics and the feedback effect rationalizes why the presence of two walls affects the system stronger than just the linear sum of two individual walls .",
    "finally we mention that this non - linear feedback effect should affect the relaxation dynamics even more in the case of systems in which the confinement is given by a tubular geometries or in cavities .",
    "having characterized in great detail the local dynamics and understood how the structural relaxation depends on the distance from the wall , we now can investigate the dynamic properties of the whole system , i.e. if one averages the correlators over @xmath0 .",
    "these averaged correlation functions are exactly the quantities that are accessible in most experiments . in contrast to experiments we are , however , in the favorable position to be able to relate these averaged quantities to the time dependence of the local ones .",
    "self part @xmath178 of the intermediate scattering function for a particles in a film with @xmath57 for @xmath99 and temperatures @xmath179 , and @xmath157 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the dashed lines are fits to the data with a superposition of two stretched exponential laws.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqt.film ] we show the time dependence of @xmath180 , i.e. the incoherent intermediate scattering function for the a particles averaged over the whole film ( solid lines ) .",
    "( the wave - vector is again parallel to the walls . )",
    "although at a first glance these correlators look quite similar to the ones in the bulk  @xcite , a closer inspection shows that there are important differences . already at @xmath70",
    "one sees that after a rapid decay to a small value around 0.05 , the correlator shows a tail that extends to relatively long times . at low temperatures",
    "the function shows at intermediate times the usual plateau that is related to the cage effect but at longer times the mentioned tail starts now to become very pronounced .",
    "the reason for this behavior follows directly from the results of the local correlation functions .",
    "since the typical time scales for the structural relaxation as a function of @xmath0 extend over several decades in time , the average over all those curves should be very stretched ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqzt ] ) . for @xmath70 particles with @xmath181 ,",
    "i.e. more than 70% of the particles , behave more or less bulk - like and contribute to the fast decay seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqt.film ] at short times .",
    "the correlators for particles at the surface decay much slower and give therefore rise to the long time tail for @xmath182 . with decreasing temperature the number of particles with a relaxation that is significantly slower than the one in the bulk becomes larger and therefore the amplitude of the long time tail increases . as a consequence",
    "the shape of the correlators change with temperature , i.e. the time - temperature superposition principle is not valid , in contrast to the case of the bulk system  @xcite .",
    "therefore the definition of characteristic relaxation times for the whole decay is not really possible .    of course one can calculate the time dependence of @xmath180 from the knowledge of the @xmath1dependent correlators which we are able to describe by a set of kww functions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqzt_superpos ] ) . on the other hand , in experiments",
    "this information is usually not available and therefore it is interesting to check how one can characterize the averaged data in a different way .",
    "we have found that for all temperatures considered , the @xmath4relaxation of the average correlator can be described very well by the sum of two kww - laws ( having different amplitudes ) : one that is for the early part of the relaxation and the second one for the mentioned tail . that this type of ansatz does indeed give a very good description of the data",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqt.film ] where we have included the results of such fits as well ( dashed lines ) .",
    "temperature dependence of the relaxation times of the two processes extracted from the self part of the intermediate scattering function averaged over all a particles in the system ( filled triangles ) .",
    "the open circles are the @xmath4relaxation time for the bulk.,width=294 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqt_fitpar ] we show the temperature dependence of the relaxation times , obtained from the kww fits , for the fast and slow process .",
    "we see that within the accuracy of the data i ) these @xmath120dependencies are very similar , although the time scale for the slow process is around 40 times larger , and ii ) that the fast process shows basically the same @xmath120dependence as the bulk system . for the fast process",
    "the values for the kww - parameter @xmath111 is around 0.8 and depends only weakly on @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast to this we find for the slow process that @xmath111 is only around 0.25 - 0.3 , i.e. a very small value  @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a strong stretching , which is basically independent of @xmath73 , is that the relaxation dynamics is extremely heterogeneous , i.e. that close to the wall the typical time scales differ by orders of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqzt ] ) .",
    "thus we find that the long time tail is basically given by the second process which has a clearly separated time scale with a smaller amplitude .",
    "note that this conclusion comes from our data in the _ time _ domain .",
    "however , it is also possible to make a time - fourier transform of our data and to calculate the dynamical susceptibility @xmath183 .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that these two processes can also be seen in the frequency domain in that one finds that the imaginary part of @xmath183 seems to be indeed the sum of two peaks .",
    "such a double peak structure is often found in real spectroscopy experiments where one observes a second peak at frequencies well below the peak corresponding to the @xmath4relaxation of the bulk system .",
    "thus from such _ averaged _ data one could easily come to the conclusion that there are indeed two distinct processes , e.g. one corresponding to particles in the center and the other to a layer of slow particles at the surface and which give rise to the second process .",
    "however , the analysis of the @xmath1dependent correlators presented here shows that such a conclusion might be wrong .",
    "time dependence of the intermediate scattering function @xmath104 for all a particles in films with different thickness ( @xmath57 , 10.0 , 5.0 ) for @xmath99 and different temperatures ( @xmath70 , 0.8 , 0.55 ) .",
    "the dotted curves correspond to the bulk data .",
    ", width=302 ]    finally we discuss how the averaged time correlation function depends on the thickness of the film . in fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqt.film.size ] we show @xmath104 for different temperatures and three values of @xmath48 as well as for the bulk system .",
    "we see that in these averaged curves one can notice already at the highest temperature a significant deviation of the correlators for the confined systems from the one of the bulk .",
    "this is due to the presence of the particles that are slowed down near _",
    "one _ of the walls .",
    "( recall that in fig .",
    "[ fig_tau_z_finitesize ] we have seen that at this @xmath73 none of the particles of even the smallest system are affected by _ both _ walls . )",
    "thus the amplitude of the tail at long times is given only by twice the fraction of the particles that are strongly affected by one wall .",
    "( note that the value of this fraction depends on @xmath48 . ) with decreasing @xmath73 the fraction of particles affected by one wall increases , due to the growing dynamical length scale and hence the curves for the confined system decay significantly slower than the bulk curves . for even lower temperatures we have the additional effect that the particles close to the center are affected in a non - linear way by the presence of _ both _ walls , which leads to an additional slowing down .",
    "thus we see that the @xmath120 and @xmath184dependence of the relaxation function is quite complex since there are three main causes : i ) the general slowing down of the dynamics with decreasing temperature ; ii ) the presence of a growing length scale over which the slow dynamics close to the wall affects the relaxation dynamics ; iii ) the non - linear effects occurring if a particle is influenced by more than one wall .",
    "the sum of these causes has the effect that the shape of the correlation function depend in a strong and highly non - trivial way on @xmath73 and @xmath48 .",
    "this dependence also hampers a sensible definition of a relaxation time which is the reason why we do not discuss the @xmath120 and @xmath184dependence of it .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of a molecular dynamics computer simulation of a binary lennard - jones liquid confined between two rough surfaces .",
    "the walls are given by a frozen amorphous configuration of the same liquid and as we have shown here that the static properties of the confined fluid are identical to the ones of the bulk system .",
    "we have found that the relaxation dynamics of particles close to the interface are slowed down by orders of magnitude with respect to the one in the bulk . due to the cooperativity of the particle motion within a liquid ,",
    "also particles at some distance from the wall are influenced by the presence of the wall .",
    "therefore the properties of the structural relaxation become a function of distance @xmath0 to the wall .",
    "all these properties are a smooth function of @xmath0 , although some of them show a very strong @xmath1dependence which results that the dynamics of the system is very heterogeneous .",
    "the time dependence of the incoherent intermediate scattering functions @xmath2 is described well by a kww - function with a stretching parameter @xmath111 and a relaxation time @xmath110 that depends strongly on @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1dependence of the relaxation times can be described well by various phenomenological laws . from these laws it is possible to extract various dynamical length scales over which the dynamics of the system is influenced by the walls .",
    "these length scales are of purely dynamical origin and show a @xmath120dependence which is compatible with an arrhenius law with an activation energy that is independent of the details of the definition of the length scale .",
    "note that this @xmath120dependence is in contrast to other dynamical length scales that have been discussed in the literature before , such as , e.g. , the dynamical heterogeneities  @xcite for which a divergence at a temperature close to @xmath185 of mode - coupling theory has been found .",
    "we have tested whether or not the @xmath120dependence of our length scales are compatible with a divergence at a finite temperature and have found , see ref .",
    "@xcite , that in principle such a scenario is possible at @xmath185 or at @xmath186 , the kauzmann temperature of the system .",
    "however , the noise in the data is unfortunately too large to make strong statements on this point .",
    "as long as the dynamical length scales are significantly smaller than the system size , the discussed results are just an effect due to the interface , i.e. the dynamics is only a function of distance to the surface and independent of the film thickness . for a film with given thickness",
    "there exists however a threshold temperature below of which particles are influenced by both interfaces since the size of the crr s are larger than @xmath187 . in that case",
    "we find that the slowing down is much stronger than one might expect from a simple linear superposition of the influence of two single surfaces .",
    "this is evidence that the mechanism for the slowing down of the particles is a strongly non - linear effect , such as proposed , e.g. , by mode - coupling theory .",
    "finally we have studied the time dependence of the correlators averaged over the whole film .",
    "these correlators are a quite complex function of @xmath73 and @xmath48 since one has to distinguish between the normal slowing down of the liquid with decreasing temperature ( which is present in the bulk system as well ) , the influence of one interface on the dynamics with a dynamical length scale that increases with decreasing @xmath73 , and last not least with the mentioned non - linear effects . in view of these different reasons for the slowing down of the average dynamics",
    ", it is clear that it is rather difficult to come up with an expression for the @xmath184dependence of the glass transition temperature , since it is not even obvious how the typical relaxation time of the system should be defined .    despite this uncertainty",
    "it is clear that the glass transition temperature , which could be defined as the temperature at which a relaxation time or the viscosity attains a given predescribed value , will increase with decreasing thickness of the film .",
    "however , we point out that this qualitative result holds only true for the case of rough walls as they have been considered in the present work . in a different study",
    "we have also investigated the relaxation dynamics of a system with _ smooth _ walls where we have again made sure that the structural properties of the confined liquid is not changed by these interfaces  @xcite . in that study we have found that the dynamics close to the wall is _ accelerated _ which in turn leads to a decrease of the glass transition temperature with decreasing @xmath48 . hence we conclude that the relaxation dynamics is strongly affected by the nature of the confining walls , in agreement with experimental results .",
    "thus it seems that it would be of interest to avoid these confining walls altogether in order to disentangle the influence of the wall on the dynamics and the effect of the finite extension of the system . within a simulation",
    "this is indeed possible since one can investigate the relaxation dynamics of a given system for different system size ( using periodic boundary conditions in all three directions ) . in the past such simulations have been done and it has been found that at a given temperature the relaxation dynamics slows down with decreasing temperature  @xcite . hence we conclude that intrinsically confinement leads to a slower dynamics but that the presence of fluid - wall interactions can completely mask this general trend .",
    "last not least we comment on the necessity for a more complete theoretical understanding of the relaxation dynamics of confined systems .",
    "the present simulations have shown that it is possible to have a slowing down of the dynamics without a change of the structural properties ( and in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that also an acceleration can be observed ) .",
    "hence we conclude that it is not sufficient to know the structure in order to predict the dynamics .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation of the bulk where it is indeed possible , using mode - coupling theory , to predict the relaxation dynamics using as input only structural quantities  @xcite .",
    "for the moment it is not clear to us how this theory has to be modified in order to rationalize the results found in this work .",
    "of course it is probably possible to use some phenomenological theories in order to describe these results  @xcite but having a theory at hand that allows a full microscopic calculation would certainly be much more preferable .",
