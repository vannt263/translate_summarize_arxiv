    "the promise of a qualitative advantage of quantum computers over classical ones in solving certain classes of problems has led to a massive effort in theoretical and experimental investigation of controlled , quantum - coherent systems .",
    "the standard circuit model ( cm ) of quantum computing is analogous to classical computing in the sense of requiring a sequence of logic gate operations .",
    "however , the requirement of precise time - dependent control of individual qubits in the quantum case is hard to achieve experimentally while still maintaining the quantum coherence of the system .",
    "a number of alternative approaches have been proposed , of which _ adiabatic quantum computing _ ( aqc ) is a promising example .",
    "this involves the evolution of a quantum system from a simple hamiltonian with an easily - prepared ground state to a hamiltonian that encodes the problem to be solved , and whose ground state encodes the solution .",
    "if the system is prepared in the initial ground state and the time evolution occurs slowly enough to satisfy the adiabatic theorem , the final state will have a large overlap with the ground state .",
    "measurement in the computational basis will then yield the desired solution with high probability @xcite .",
    "several authors have demonstrated polynomial equivalence between aqc and the cm , mapping the latter onto an aqc with @xmath3-local interactions between qubits or @xmath4-local interactions between @xmath5-state qudits in two dimensions @xcite , or with @xmath4-local interactions between qubits on a two - dimensional lattice ( but requiring two or more control hamiltonians ) @xcite .    despite these proofs of equivalence between aqc and cm ,",
    "it is clear that there are classes of problems more suited to one or the other ; in addition , aqc is believed to be more robust against decoherence @xcite , although the effects of decoherence @xcite and noise @xcite imply an optimal computation time , beyond which errors increase .",
    "the type of problems most suited to aqc include optimization problems , where the requirement is to find the global minimum of a cost function @xmath6 , and the related decision problems , where the requirement is to demonstrate the existence of a good solution @xmath7 obeying @xmath8 for some specified @xmath9 .",
    "thus the existence proof of a polynomial - time aqc implementation of shor s prime factorization algorithm does not help practical implementation : one rather starts afresh and maps factorization onto an optimization problem , as in the recent nmr factorization of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "simulations of the travelling salesman problem show faster decay of residual energy ( i.  e. , tour length ) through aqc than through classical simulated annealing , although other classical algorithms are faster @xcite .",
    "applications have also been found in graph theory , most recently in the evaluation of ramsey numbers @xcite .",
    "the task of aqc is to find the ground state of a hamiltonian @xmath11 ; this hamiltonian encodes the problem under consideration and its ( unknown ) eigenvalues determine the cost function . a hamiltonian @xmath12 interpolates between a simple initial hamiltonian , @xmath13 , at time @xmath14 and the desired final hamiltonian , @xmath11 , at the end of the computation @xmath15 .",
    "many interpolation schemes have been considered , which may optimize final - state fidelity but require some knowledge of the energy - level structure @xcite or phase cancellation @xcite .",
    "we therefore restrict consideration to the simple linear interpolation @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] is the reduced time @xmath18 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath12 of an @xmath19-qubit system are given by @xmath20 the instantaneous state of the system is given by @xmath21 , the solution of schrdinger s equation , which in reduced time ( and @xmath22 ) reads @xmath23 the system is prepared in the ( non - degenerate ) ground state of @xmath13 : @xmath24 .",
    "at the end of the evolution a suitable figure of merit is the closeness of the state vector , @xmath25 , to the desired result , @xmath26 .",
    "this is provided by the _ success probability _ @xmath27 the subscript @xmath19 , denoting the number of qubits , will be omitted except where a distinction needs to be made .    in practical optimization problems , a low - cost solution that is",
    "not necessarily the global optimum often suffices . here",
    "the _ energy error _",
    "@xmath28 is a suitable figure of merit .",
    "approximate adiabatic quantum computing ( aaqc ) aims to reduce this error @xcite . for",
    "some purposes other characterizations of the final - state distribution @xmath29 may be more appropriate figures of merit . in the present work we shall concentrate on the success probability .",
    "we require @xmath30 parameters to specify the hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to investigate to what extent the success probability ( [ eq : p ] ) can be approximated as a function @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a small ( @xmath19-independent ) number of parameters characterizing the initial and final hamiltonians .",
    "the most important dependence is expected to be on the _ minimum gap _ between ground state and first excited state @xmath33 which occurs at the reduced time(s ) @xmath34 : @xmath35    while it has long been known @xcite that this probability tends to unity for slow evolution : @xmath36 the precise statement of this _ adiabatic theorem _ has been the subject of much debate in recent years @xcite .",
    "the original statement in the context of aqc @xcite was that the adiabatic condition @xmath37 where @xmath38 guarantees @xmath0 to be very close to @xmath39 .",
    "while this only considers transitions into the first excited state , such transitions will dominate in most situations .",
    "et al _ @xcite derived such a result , with @xmath40 taken as the maximum over all matrix elements to excited states .",
    "if @xmath40 is considered constant ( of the order of a typical eigenvalue of @xmath13 ) , @xmath1 determines the required @xmath2 .",
    "it is however sufficient ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) to require an evolution time @xmath41 for all excited states @xmath42 .",
    "( in the present context we are restricting consideration to evolution of the ground state . )",
    "some authors @xcite have claimed counterexamples to the above criterion .",
    "however , these counterexamples include a resonant term , which is absent from our interpolating hamiltonian ( [ eq : aqch ] ) .    for practical purposes",
    "the knowledge that the success probability tends to unity in the infinite - time limit is of less interest than knowledge of parameters governing success for finite evolution times ; it is this question that motivates our study . the minimum gap @xmath1 is usually considered to be the dominant parameter determining the success probability for a given evolution time .",
    "these two variables , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are both used in the literature to quantify the performance of a given computation , and are assumed to increase monotonically with each other .",
    "the question of how either of these variables varies with system size is an important one that is often addressed .",
    "however , the exact nature of the correlation between these two important figures of merit has not been fully explored .",
    "we explore the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 by looking at the statistical distributions of these two variables over an ensemble of problem hamiltonians ( @xmath11 ) for fixed computation times @xmath2 .",
    "we start by considering a simple two - qubit system and show that a rich structure arises in the scatter plots of success probability against @xmath1 .",
    "we then go on to look at the scatter plots in three- , four- and five - qubit systems and find that , although some of the finer details of the structure are washed out , some remain .",
    "we wish to look at the distribution of the success probability and @xmath1 over a large set of problem hamiltonians .",
    "we use a simple , yet generic , model that is scalable and can be readily solved numerically .",
    "for @xmath13 we use a transverse field of unit magnitude acting on all the qubits : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denote the usual pauli matrices , @xmath19 is the number of qubits in the system ; the @xmath45 matrix @xmath46 acts on the @xmath47th qubit .",
    "the ( non - degenerate ) ground state of @xmath13 is an equal superposition @xmath48 of all @xmath49 computational basis states .    for @xmath11",
    ", we use a random - energy hamiltonian , diagonal in the computational basis , where all @xmath50-axis couplings between the @xmath19 qubits are realized : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the @xmath47th digit in the binary representation of @xmath53 . where there are @xmath54 non - zero bits in the binary representation of @xmath53 , the coupling constant @xmath55 represents a @xmath54-local interaction ( a non - trivial interaction between @xmath54 qubits ) .",
