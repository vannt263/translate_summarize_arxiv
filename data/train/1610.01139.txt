    "over the past decade , there has been growing interest in the physics of active matter , defined as collections of self - driven particles that exhibit rich emergent behavior  @xcite .",
    "realizations abound in the living world , from bird flocks  @xcite to epithelial cell monolayers  @xcite , and in engineered systems , such as self - catalytic colloids  @xcite and microswimmers @xcite .",
    "the distinctive property of active systems is that the particles are independently driven out of equilibrium and time reversal symmetry is broken locally , rather than globally as in systems driven out of equilibrium by external fields or boundary forces .",
    "progress has recently been made in formulating the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of active matter using a minimal model of active brownian particles ( abps ) consisting of purely repulsive self - propelled spherical colloids with overdamped dynamics  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable property of this simple system is that it spontaneously phase separates into a dense liquid phase and a gas phase in the absence of any attractive interactions  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon arises from the persistent dynamics of self - propelled particles when the time for particles to reorient after a collision exceeds the mean free time between collisions , hence the name of motility - induced phase separation ( mips ) .",
    "additionally , in a sort of reverse mips , confined abps spontaneously accumulate at the walls of the container  @xcite , a behavior which is at odds with fundamental properties of gases and fluids in thermal equilibrium .",
    "these findings have raised a lot of interest in understanding whether active matter can be characterized in terms of equilibrium - like properties , such as effective temperature and pressure .",
    "motile particles exert additional forces on the walls of a container as compared to passive ones simply as the result of their motility .",
    "these forces have been quantified recently in terms of a new contribution to the pressure , dubbed swim pressure , that measures the flux of propulsive forces across a unit bulk plane of material  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown , however , that in generic active systems the mechanical force exerted on the walls of the container depends on the detail of particle - walls interactions , making it impossible to define the pressure of an active fluid as a state function  @xcite .",
    "this result , however , does not apply to the special case of spherical abps",
    ". for this minimal model it has been shown that the pressure is indeed a state function that characterizes the bulk materials properties of this simple active fluid @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of pressure of spherical abps is unusual , in that simulations have reported a non - monotonic behavior of pressure versus density , arising from the suppression of motility ( and therefore of swim pressure ) associated with particle caging at the onset of phase separation  @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of pressure of active colloids have similarly shown a strong suppression of pressure at intermediate density  @xcite . in spite of extensive work",
    ", some open question remains concerning the quantitative role of finite - size effects in active systems and the origin and robustness of the non - monotonic behavior of pressure .",
    "in this paper we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the pressure of spherical abps with soft repulsive forces and correlate its non - monotonic behavior with density with the kinetics of cluster size growth in phase separating systems . by examining both systems bounded by confining walls and ones with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "we show that finite - size effects are consistent in both cases with the behavior expected for a rarefied thermal gas .",
    "the pressure calculated in confined systems is strongly suppressed by the presence of boundaries if the persistence length of the particles dynamics is comparable to the linear size of the container , with a linear dependence on system size and a behavior that resembles that of a rarified knudsen gas . with periodic boundary conditions",
    "the convergence to the large system size limit is exponential , again as expected in a thermal system . these results are consistent with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for hard abps .",
    "using periodic boundary conditions , we show that the non - monotonic behavior of pressure with density is not a finite - size effect and is associated with a sharp drop of the swim pressure at the onset of phase separation . by comparing the time evolution of the instantaneous pressure and the kinetics of cluster growth , we identify two dynamical regimes that control the relaxation of a disordered initial state towards the nonequilibrium steady state of the system . for system parameters that produce a homogeneous steady state",
    ", pressure grows monotonically in time to its steady state value , which it reaches on a timescale controlled by the persistence time of the self - propelled dynamics .",
    "in contrast , for parameters that produce a phase - separated steady state , the time evolution of the pressure is not monotonic and there are two dynamical regimes .",
    "initially , small clusters form and break up rapidly and the pressure quickly builds up and overshoots its asymptotic value . eventually , the dynamics crosses over to a coarsening regime with a slower cluster growth and the pressure relaxes to its steady - state value .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii described the abp model and provides details of our simulations .",
    "section iii examines the swim pressure and its behavior at low and high density .",
    "it also discusses the relevance of finite - size effects .",
    "section iv examines correlations between the pressure relaxation and the kinetics of mips of swim pressure .",
    "finally , we close in section v with some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a well - established minimal model of monodipersed abps in two dimensions  @xcite , consisting of @xmath0 self - propelled disks of radius @xmath1 in a square box of area @xmath2 .",
    "each particle is identified by the position @xmath3 of its center and a unit vector @xmath4 that defines the axis of self propulsion . assuming the medium only provides friction , the dynamics is governed by langevin equations , given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bare self - propulsion speed , directed along @xmath7 and @xmath8 a gaussian random torque with zero mean and variance @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the rate of rotational diffusion .",
    "the pair forces @xmath11 are purely repulsive and harmonic , with @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 otherwise , where @xmath15 is the interparticle separation and @xmath16 . finally , @xmath17 is the mobility .",
    "we neglect here noise in the translational dynamics , which is less important than the orientational one in both synthetic active colloids and swimming bacteria  @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium nature of this minimal active model is provided entirely by the propulsive force @xmath18 , which represents a non - markovian stochastic force correlated over the persistence time @xmath19 .",
    "since the finite correlation time of the noisy propulsive force is not matched by similar correlations in the friction coefficient @xmath20 , which is constant , the system does not obey the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation theorem embodied by the stokes - einstein relation .     in the plane of packing fraction @xmath21 and persistence length @xmath22 .",
    "the color bar shows the value of the local density variance .",
    "this is computed by dividing the system in @xmath23 windows of size @xmath24 and evaluating @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the packing fraction of each window and @xmath21 is the total packing fraction .",
    "the red points in the phase diagram correspond to large values of @xmath27 and , therefore , to phase - separated systems.[fig : phase_diagram],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the persistence time @xmath28 controls the crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime in the single particle dynamics .",
    "for @xmath29 the dynamics of noninteracting abps is diffusive , with diffusion coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "the single particle dynamics can also be characterized by the persistence length , @xmath31 , and the rotational pclet number , @xmath32 , used in much of the literature  @xcite .",
    "our simulations employ a conventional brownian dynamics algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we take the interaction timescale , @xmath33 , as the unit time and the particle radius @xmath1 as the unit of length . to prevent particles from passing through each other , we set @xmath34 .",
    "we choose a time step sufficiently small to handle many - body interactions at high density , @xmath35 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , purely repulsive abps exhibit macroscopic phase separation , or mips , where the dense phase grows to the size of the system and nearly free particles in the gas phase try to explore lengths or order @xmath22 . for this reason ,",
    "abps are subject to strong finite - size effects that we quantify here by considering simulation boxes of linear size @xmath36 , both in a closed box geometry and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we tune the packing fraction @xmath37 that sets the total number of particles , @xmath0 , with @xmath38 for @xmath39 . a schematic representation of the region of the phase diagram explored in the present work is shown in fig .  [ fig : phase_diagram ] , where the color represents the variance of the local density .",
    "hence red corresponds to a phase - separated state and blue to a homogeneous state .",
    "all simulations have been run for a time @xmath40 of @xmath41 time units or longer . to examine the time evolution of our observables , we average the relevant physical quantities over exponentially increasing time windows . in particular",
    ", we use the so - called @xmath42-binning procedure by following the evolution of averages in time intervals @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the error bars are estimated from the fluctuations between several independent runs with a jackknife procedure ( @xmath44 runs for @xmath45 , @xmath46@xmath47 runs for larger values of @xmath21 ) .",

    "we consider the simulation to have reached a steady state if the averages in at least the first three @xmath48 are compatible with each other within errors . if this condition is not met , we double the simulation time .",

    "<S> active brownian particles ( abps ) represent a minimal model of active matter consisting of self - propelled spheres with purely repulsive interactions and rotational noise . here </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the pressure of abps in two dimensions in both closed boxes and systems with periodic boundary conditions and show that its nonmonotonic behavior with density is a robust feature , independent of system size . </S>",
    "<S> we correlate the time evolution of the mean pressure towards its steady state value with the kinetics of motility - induced phase separation . for parameter values corresponding to phase separated steady states , we identify two dynamical regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure grows monotonically in time during the initial regime of rapid cluster formation , overshooting its steady state value and then quickly relaxing to it , and remains constant during the subsequent slower period of cluster coalescence and coarsening . </S>",
    "<S> the overshoot is a distinctive feature of active systems . </S>"
