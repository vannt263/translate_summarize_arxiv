    "damped lyman-@xmath3 systems ( dlas ) are characterized by high column densities .",
    "such a gas , in a galactic environment in nearby universe , always harbors detectable amount of 2 . in our galaxy ,",
    "all clouds with @xmath4(hi ) @xmath5 have @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium formation of 2 molecules is controlled by dust grains , kinetic temperature , particle density and ambient uv radiation field .",
    "thus molecular content of gas that produces dlas can give vital clues about the local physical conditions .",
    "more recently ge & bechtold@xcite have searched , for 2 in 8 dlas , using the mmt moderate resolution spectrograph ( @xmath7  =  1   ) .",
    "they have detected 2 in two systems and found upper limits on the molecular faction , @xmath8=2n(2)/(2n(2)+n ( ) ) , ranging between @xmath9 and 10@xmath10 for non - detection .",
    "however as 2 lines are prone to contamination by intergalactic absorption , reliable measurement of 2 column densities can be achieved only using high spectral resolution data@xcite .",
    "we use the blue sensitivity of uves to perform 2 searches at @xmath11 where the contamination is less .",
    "main objectives of our ongoing uves programme are : ( i ) to perform systematic search for 2 in dlas with good detection limit and ( ii ) to extract physical conditions in the systems using spectra of wide wavelength coverage . till date 19",
    "dlas were searched for 2 using the spectra collected during our programme as well as from eso public archive .",
    "detail analysis of 2 molecule is possible in 5 systems ( = 1.973 toward 0013 - 004@xcite,@xcite ; = 3.025 toward 0347 - 383@xcite,@xcite ; = 2.811 toward 0528 - 250@xcite ; = 2.338 toward 0551 - 366@xcite ; = 2.338 toward 1232 + 082@xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we achieve detection limit of 10@xmath12 @xmath13 for 2 and the derived upper limits on molecular fraction are in the range @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "we detect 2 in two distinct components separated by 50 ( see fig .  [ h2q0551 ] ) .",
    "we measure , @xmath8= 1.4@xmath16 .",
    "c  i , c  i@xmath17 are detected in 6 distinct velocity components spread over 150 .",
    "the iron - peak elements are depleted compared to zinc , [ x / z]@xmath18 , probably because they are tied up onto dust grains .",
    "the depletion of heavy elements remains about the same in all the detected c  i components , irrespective of the presence or absence of 2 .",
    "moreover the components in which 2 is detected have large densities , @xmath19 , and low temperatures , @xmath20 k. this demonstrates that the presence of 2 is not only related to the dust - to - metal ratio but is also highly dependent on the physical conditions of the gas . the photo - dissociation rate derived in the components where",
    "2 is detected suggests the presence of a local uv radiation field stronger than that in the galaxy by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "vigorous star formation therefore probably occurs near the 2-bearing cloud .      2",
    "is detected in four distinct components that are spread over @xmath21700  km  s@xmath22.the overall molecular fraction is in the range @xmath232.7  @xmath24  log  @xmath8  @xmath24  @xmath230.6 , which is the highest value found for dla systems .",
    "the presence of 2 among different components is closely related to the physical conditions : high particle density , low temperature .",
    "the excitation of high @xmath25 levels suggests that the uv radiation field is highly inhomogeneous through the system .",
    "the depletion , [ fe / zn ]  =  @xmath231.92 , [ fe / s ]  =  @xmath231.86 , [ si / zn ]  =  @xmath231.01 , [ si / s ]  =  @xmath230.95 , similar to what is observed in cold gas of the galactic disk is seen in one of these components . 2 , with log  @xmath26(h@xmath2 )",
    "@xmath21  16.5 , is detected in this metal rich ( [ zn / h ]  @xmath27  @xmath230.54 ) component",
    ". however dust extinction due to this component is negligible owing to small total column density , log  @xmath26 ( )  @xmath28  19.6 .",
    "the observed global metallicities are [ p / h ]  =  @xmath230.59 , [ zn / h ]  =  @xmath230.70 and [ s / h ]  =  @xmath230.71 relative to solar . the clear correlation we notice between [ fe / s ] and [ si / s ] in different components indicates that the abundance pattern is due to dust - depletion .",
    "we confirm the presence of 2 in this system with @xmath8  = 3.8@xmath2910@xmath10 .",
    "for the first time we detect hd molecular lines with n(hd)= 1@xmath30 @xmath13@xcite .",
    "the metallicity is 6.3@xmath310.7@xmath3210@xmath33 solar with iron depleted by a factor of @xmath215 .",
    "absorption profiles corresponding to transitions from @xmath25  @xmath27  1 rotational levels are consistent with a single component at the same redshift as c  i absorption .",
    "the physical conditions within the cloud at @xmath34  =  2.3377 can be constrained directly from the observation of h@xmath2 , c  i , c  i@xmath35 , c  i@xmath36 and c  ii@xmath35",
    ". the kinetic temperature is defined by the @xmath25  =  0@xmath231 2 excitation temperature , 100  @xmath24  @xmath37  @xmath24  300  k ; the particle density is then constrained using the @xmath26(c  ii@xmath35)/@xmath26(c  ii ) column density ratio , 30  @xmath24  @xmath38  @xmath24  50  @xmath39 ; and uv pumping is estimated to be of the same order as in our galaxy .",
    "we notice a 3.1@xmath40 correlation between molecular fraction and dust depletion@xcite . however in the case of systems with @xmath41 ,",
    "the level populations of c  i fine - structure lines suggest large densities ( n@xmath42 @xmath39 ) and low temperature ( t@xmath43k ) .",
    "also in the systems that show multiple components the presence / absence of 2 in a given component is independent of the dust to gas ratio .",
    "thus it is most likely that , even though dust is important for the formation of 2 , local physical conditions ( gas density & temperature ) play the vital role in governing the molecular fraction of a given cloud . the thermal pressure derived from the fine - structure excitation of c  i lines are much larger than that derived along the ism sightlines .",
    "this difference can not be accounted for by the cmbr pumping alone .",
    "lack of 2 in systems with moderate dust depletion can be understood as the direct consequence of high kinetic temperature @xcite .",
    "it is most likely that considerable percentage of the dlas arise in diffuse and warm gas , typically @xmath44 k. this is consistent with the high spin temperature inferred in few systems@xcite .",
