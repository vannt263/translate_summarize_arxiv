    "theoretical models for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can be divided into two categories : those named fireball models that treat the shock interaction of relativistic outflows and production of gamma rays and afterglows in other wavelengths ( see , e.g. , mszros 2002 and zhang & mszros 2004 for reviews ) , and those that explore the central engine of the fireball , i.e. , the energy source of relativistic outflows .",
    "most popular models in the latter category are in common invoking a stellar - mass black hole accreting with a hypercritical rate , of the order of 1 .",
    "the main problem in these models is how to convert some fraction of the released gravitational energy of the accreted matter into a relativistic outflow , creating an explosion with energy @xmath0 @xmath1-@xmath2 ergs ( depending on whether emission is isotropic or it is beamed ) .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed to tackle this problem : the neutrino emission and annihilation , and the energy extraction from the accretion disk and/or the black hole via magnetohydrodynamical processes ( see , e.g. , popham et al . 1999 and di matteo et al .",
    "2002 for references ) .",
    "the former mechanism is easier to understand and can be calculated more accurately , and is the topic we wish to discuss in this paper .    in the inner region of such a hyperaccretion disk",
    "the density and temperature are so high ( @xmath3 @xmath4 g  @xmath5 , @xmath6 k ) that photons are totally trapped , and large amounts of energetic neutrinos are emitted , carrying away the viscous dissipation energy of accreted gas .",
    "annihilation of some fraction of emitted neutrinos produces a relativistic electron - positron outflow to power a grb .",
    "the properties of such a neutrino - cooled accretion disk model were first worked out in details by popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . from the observational point of view",
    ", the key question to be answered in this model is whether the neutrino annihilation can indeed provide sufficient energy for grbs .",
    "popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) gave a positive answer to this question , but they assumed a priori that the accretion disk is transparent for neutrinos , thus their neutrino radiation luminosity ( before annihilation ) @xmath7 and accordingly neutrino annihilation luminosity @xmath8 might be overestimated .",
    "later , di matteo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) recalculated @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the neutrino - cooled accretion disk model , taking the neutrino opacity into account .",
    "they obtained that even for a modest mass accretion rate the inner region of the disk becomes opaque and neutrinos are sufficiently trapped , the resulting @xmath8 is @xmath9 @xmath1 ergs s@xmath10 and is inadequate for grbs .",
    "in a recent work ( gu et al .",
    "2006 ) we showed that when the general relativistic effect is considered and the contribution from the optically thick region is included , the neutrino - cooled accretion disk can work as the central engine for grbs , although the correct @xmath8 is somewhat lower than that of popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) because of the effect of neutrino opacity .",
    "in addition to the general relativity and the neutrino opacity , there are certainly other factors that may influence the neutrino radiation and annihilation of a neutrino - cooled accretion disk , such as the electron degeneracy and the electron fraction . in our previous work ( gu et al .",
    "2006 ) the treatment of electron degeneracy was oversimplified , and the electron fraction @xmath11 was simply taken to be 0.5 , i.e. , assuming an equal mix of protons and neutrons since @xmath12 = @xmath13/(@xmath13 + @xmath14 ) , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the total number density of protons and that of neutrons , respectively .",
    "kohri & mineshige ( 2002 ) pointed out that when electrons are degenerate , there emerges an important consequence that the electron - positron pair creation and accordingly the neutrino emission are suppressed .",
    "kohri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) took great care to calculate the ratio of free neutrons to free protons @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 since this ratio has a large effect on the neutrino emission rates : the true ratio @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 1 ( or @xmath19 ) resulted from neutronization processes will also lead to a suppression of neutrino emission ( note that they did not distinguish between @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath20,@xmath17 , see  2.3.1 ) .",
    "they made calculations for the neutrino emission rates and other quantities even in the delicate regime where the electron degeneracy is moderate , which is also a significant improvement over previous works .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also considered the effects of electron degeneracy and electron fraction in neutrino - cooled accretion disks : they used an expression for the pressure of ultra - relativistic electrons with arbitrary degeneracy and calculated @xmath12 with an approximate bridging formula that allows for a transition from the neutrino optically thin to optically thick regime .",
    "these works ( kohri & mineshige 2002 ; kohri et al . 2005 ; lee et al .",
    "2005 ) made advances in microphysics , but they were within the newtonian framework .",
    "very recently , chen & beloborodov ( 2006 ) presented fully relativistic calculations of the structure of neutrino - cooled accretion disks around kerr black holes and proved that both the electron degeneracy and the electron fraction dramatically affect the disk and its neutrino emission .",
    "it is seen from the above brief review that the electron degeneracy and the lower electron fraction certainly suppress the neutrino emission and reduce the neutrino annihilation luminosity of a neutrino - cooled accretion disk .",
    "the question remains whether the reduced neutrino annihilation luminosity is still adequate for grbs . in this paper",
    "we try to refine our previous results of the structure and luminosity of neutrino - cooled accretion disks by considering the relevant microphysics more completely and more accurately .",
    "we limit the central accreting black hole to be a non - rotating one , its general relativistic effect is simulated by the well - known paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) potential @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the black hole mass , @xmath23 is the radius , and @xmath24 is the schwarzschild radius .    as in the relevant previous works , the hydrodynamics of hyperaccretion disks",
    "is expected to be similar to that of normal accretion disks in x - ray binaries , and is well approximated by that of steady axisymmetric height - averaged accretion flows ( e.g. , chap .",
    "3 of kato et al .",

    "the angular velocity is approximately keplerian , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "the disk is in the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , and this gives @xmath32 . with these simplifications",
    "the problem is reduced to be one - dimensional , i.e. , all physical quantities depend on @xmath23 only .",
    "the constant mass accretion rate @xmath33 is expressed from the continuity equation as  = -4rh v ,  where @xmath34 is the radial velocity that can be read from the angular momentum equation as  v = h c_s(1 - j/ _ k r^ 2)^- 1 ,  where @xmath35 is an integration constant determined by the zero - torque boundary condition at the last stable orbit , and it represents the specific angular momentum ( per unit mass ) of the matter accreted into the black hole .      the energy equation is generally written as the balance between the viscous heating and the cooling rates ( per unit area of a half - disk above or below the equator ) ,  = q^- .  the viscous heating rate @xmath36 is similar to that of normal accretion disks ,  = - _ k r ( 1-j/_k r^2 ) .",
    "but the cooling rate @xmath37 is crucially different , it has three contributions :  q^-=+ + .  in this equation",
    "there is no cooling term of photon radiation ( it is practically zero in our calculations ) .",
    "instead , photons are totally trapped in the disk , so they contribute to the advective cooling and the pressure ( see below ) .",
    "the cooling rate by photodisintegration of @xmath30-particles @xmath38 is  = 6.8 10 ^ 28 _ 10 v h  ,  where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the mass fraction of free nucleons ( e.g. , kohri et al . 2005 ) .",

    "it is indeed the case as seen from figure 4b that the contribution to @xmath167 from absorption relating to the urca processes @xmath170 is most important , the contribution from neutrino annihilation into @xmath171 pairs @xmath172 is of some relative importance only in the very outer region , and the contributions from nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung @xmath173 and from the inverse process of plasmon decay @xmath174 are totally negligible because the electron degeneracy is not very high . as to @xmath175 ( fig .",
    "4c ) , the contribution through scattering off free neutrons @xmath176 is dominant over other contributions due to free protons @xmath177 , electrons @xmath178 , and @xmath30-particles @xmath179 ( @xmath179 is too small to be seen in the figure ) , obviously because of the richness of neutrons .",
    "having @xmath163 in mind , we now check the validity of our bridging formula for @xmath11 , i.e. , equation ( 42 ) . in figure 5 , @xmath11 calculated using equation ( 42 ) is drawn by the solid line . here",
    "@xmath180= 5is taken because only at such a high accretion rate the inner region of the disk can become noticeably optically thick . for comparison , the dashed line in the figure draws @xmath11 in the case that the disk material is assumed to be globally opaque to neutrinos , which is calculated with ( see eq . [ 39 ] )  y_e= ( 1-x_nuc)+x_nuc[1+]^-1 , and the dotted line draws @xmath11 if the material is globally transparent to neutrinos , obtained with the approximate formula of beloborodov ( 2003 ) ,  y_e= ( 1-x_nuc)+x_nuc [ + 0.487 ( ) ] .",
    "these two equations do not include the effect of varying neutrino optical depth .",
    "it is clear that our equation ( 42 ) does represent a bridge between the optically very thick and optically very thin limits , and it provides a reasonable estimate of @xmath11 in the intermediate regime where @xmath11 is overestimated by equation ( 46 ) and underestimated by equation ( 47 ) .    in figure 6",
    "we show the ratios of various cooling rates to the viscous heating rate @xmath36 .",
    "the photon radiation cooling is never important in hyperaccretion disks ( it is practically zero when we try to calculate it ) .",
    "advective cooling @xmath41 is dominant only in the outer region of the disk @xmath181 , because in this region the photodisintegration of @xmath30-particles has not started and the neutrino emission is weak . in the middle region @xmath182 , the @xmath30-particle photodisintegration cooling @xmath38 dominates , corresponding to a sharp decrease of @xmath87 and increase of ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in the inner region",
    "@xmath183 , the neutrino cooling @xmath111 becomes dominant as expected .",
    "we do not present here numerical results for the disk structure with varying values of @xmath30 and @xmath33 .",
    "differences caused by changing these two parameters are only quantitative and have been discussed in , e.g. , kohri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and chen & beloborodov ( 2006 ) . briefly speaking , @xmath30 smaller than 0.1",
    "will make the density higher , the electron degeneracy higher , the electron fraction lower , and the neutrino - dominated region larger ; and at still larger accretion rates , advection can become dominant over neutrino cooling again in a very small region ( @xmath184 for @xmath33=5 , see fig . 3 of gu et al .",
    "2006 ) , because in that region the optical depth is very large and neutrinos are trapped in the disk .",
    "having the neutrino cooling rate @xmath111 , the neutrino radiation luminosity ( before annihilation ) @xmath185 is obtained as l_=4 _ r_in^r_out q _ r d r. in our calculations the inner and outer edge of the disk are taken to be @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .    for the calculation of the neutrino annihilation luminosity",
    "we follow the approach in ruffert et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and rosswog et al .",
    "the disk is modeled as a grid of cells in the equatorial plane .",
    "a cell @xmath188 has its mean neutrino energy @xmath189 , neutrino radiation luminosity @xmath190 , and distance to a space point above ( or below ) the disk @xmath191 .",
    "the angle at which neutrinos from cell @xmath188 encounter antineutrinos from another cell @xmath192 at that point is denoted as @xmath193 .",
    "then the neutrino annihilation luminosity at that point is given by the summation over all pairs of cells ,  l_=_i a_1,i _ k _ k ( _ _ i^k + _ _ i^k ) ( 1-)^2 + + _ i a_2,i _ k _ k , where @xmath194[{(c_{v,\\nu_{i}}-c_{a,\\nu_{i}})}^2 + { ( c_{v,\\nu_{i}}+c_{a,\\nu_{i}})}^2]$ ] , @xmath195 @xmath196 , with @xmath197 and @xmath198 given in  2.3.1 .",
    "the total neutrino annihilation luminosity is obtained by the integration over the whole space outside the black hole and the disk ,  l_=4 _ r_g^_h^l _ r d r d z.    figure 7 shows @xmath185 ( the thick dashed line ) and @xmath199 ( the thick solid line ) with varying @xmath33 ( @xmath200 , @xmath144 , and @xmath201 are kept ) . for comparison , these two luminosities calculated in our previous work ( gu et al .",
    "2006 ) , where the electron degeneracy was not correctly considered and @xmath11 was taken to be equal to 0.5 , are also given in the figure by the thin dashed line and thin solid line , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the electron degeneracy and the lower @xmath11 resulted from the neutronization processes indeed suppress the neutrino emission considerably , the resulting @xmath202 and @xmath8 are reduced by a factor @xmath203 comparing with their overestimated values in gu et al .",
    "even so , the correct @xmath8 is still well above @xmath204 provided @xmath205 1 , and reaches to @xmath206 when @xmath207 10 .",
    "therefore , based on the energy consideration , neutrino - cooled accretion disks can work as the central engine of grbs .",
    "note that our calculations are for a nonrotating black hole , both popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and chen & beloborodov ( 2006 ) have shown that a spinning ( kerr ) black hole will enhance the neutrino radiation efficiency , this only strengthens our conclusion here .    in figure 8 the corresponding neutrino radiation efficiency @xmath208 and neutrino annihilation efficiency @xmath209 ) are shown by the dashed line and solid line , respectively .",
    "it is seen that @xmath210 does not change much with varying @xmath33 ; while @xmath211 increases rapidly with increasing @xmath33 , this is because at higher accretion rates more neutrinos are emitted and in turn have higher probabilities to encounter with each other .    to see the spatial distribution of neutrino annihilation luminosity , we plot in figure 9 contours of ( @xmath212 ) in units of ( @xmath213 ) , i.e. , the neutrino annihilation luminosity of a circle with cylindrical coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath125 , for @xmath33= 1 .",
    "the figure has two important implications .",
    "first , it demonstrates the strong focusing of neutrino annihilation towards the central region of space .",
    "in fact , by performing the integration of equation ( 50 ) out to each radius we get that nearly 60% of the total annihilation luminosity is ejected from the region @xmath214 .",
    "second , it shows that the annihilation luminosity varies more rapidly along the @xmath125 coordinate than along the @xmath23 coordinate , indicating that this luminosity is anisotropic and most of the annihilation energy escapes outward along the angular momentum axis of the disk .",
    "in this paper we wish to discuss whether the annihilation of neutrinos emitted from hyperaccretion disks can provide sufficient energy for grbs , i.e. , to estimate the neutrino annihilation luminosity @xmath8 . to do this ,",
    "we need to know the neutrino optical depth @xmath63 , because it determines the neutrino cooling rate @xmath111 ( eq .",
    "[ 9 ] ) and the neutrino radiation luminosity @xmath7 ( eq . [ 48 ] ) .    to calculate contributions to @xmath63 from various absorption and scattering processes of neutrinos ( eq . [ 16 ] ) , we need to know the composition and physical state of disk matter , namely the fractions of electrons @xmath11 and free nucleons , and the electron chemical potential @xmath58 ( or electron degeneracy @xmath65 ) , with given density @xmath29 and temperature @xmath62 . we give exact definitions of the free proton fraction @xmath141 and free neutron fraction @xmath142 and their relations to @xmath11 and @xmath40 , and get three equations ( eqs . [ 42 ] , [ 44 ] , and [ 45 ] ) from the conditions of @xmath112-equilibrium , nuclear statistical equilibrium , and charge neutrality that describe the interdependence of @xmath141 , @xmath88 , @xmath58 , and @xmath63 .",
    "we prove that the electron degeneracy has important effects indeed , but mainly not in the sense that it suppresses the creation of neutrinos from @xmath215 pairs and enlarges the electron pressure ( kohri & mineshige 2002 ; kohri et al .",
    "as seen from figures 4b and 3 , the neutrino cooling due to @xmath215 pair annihilation @xmath101 is much smaller than that due to the urca processes @xmath96 , and the electron pressure is important only in the outer region of the disk where the @xmath30-particle disintegration has not started . instead , the main effects of electron degeneracy are : ( 1 ) it increases @xmath96 greatly , so that the corresponding absorption makes a major contribution to the neutrino optical depth ( fig .",
    "4 ) ; ( 2 ) it along with the neutronization processes cause @xmath11 to become smaller than 0.1 in the inner region of the disk ( fig .",
    "2 ) where the neutrino cooling is dominant ( fig . 6 ) .    the resulting @xmath8 is considerably reduced comparing with that in previous works where the electron degeneracy was not considered and @xmath11 was taken to be 0.5 , however it is still likely to be adequate for grbs , and its spatial distribution is likely to be anisotropic .",
    "perhaps the main limitation of our calculations here is that they are one - dimensional . as in most of previous works in the field",
    ", we do not study the vertical structure of the disk and instead use the simple one - zone approximation of the vertically - averaged model .",
    "in particular , we do not consider the distribution and transport of neutrinos in the vertical direction of the disk , a problem that remains unsolved or even rarely touched ( sawyer 2003 ) .",
    "strictly speaking , a reliable quantitative evaluation of the neutrino annihilation luminosity should require two - dimensional calculations , in which the vertical structure and neutrino transport are self - consistently included .",
    "but in view of the fact that most popular models of normal accretion disks ( the shakura - sunyaev disk model , the slim disk model , and the advection - dominated accretion flow model ) are also one - dimensional and have been proved successful , our results here may provide a plausible , though rough , estimate of the luminosity of neutrino - cooled accretion disks .",
