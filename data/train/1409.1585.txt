    "the spectral properties of the quasar sdss j092712.65 + 294344.0 ( hereafter : j0927 + 2943 ) have attracted much attention since its first recognition by @xcite .",
    "its spectral peculiarity is due to the presence of emission lines at different redshifts : a set of broad and ( faint ) narrow emission lines ( bels and nels respectively ) is observed at @xmath0 ( hereafter , the ` blue ' system ) , together with a set of brighter nels at @xmath1 ( the ` red ' system , corresponding to a velocity difference @xmath2 ; see fig .",

    "@xcite proposed j0927 + 2943 as a first example of recoiling agn candidate , i.e. , the result of the coalescence of a massive black hole ( bh ) binary ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the bh remnant is kicked out of the host nucleus at a velocity of up to @xmath3 km s@xmath4 .",
    "such a high speed allows the bh to drag along only matter initially very close to it , namely the accretion disc ( if present ) and the gas responsible for the bels ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "gas orbiting at larger distances , such as the molecular torus and gas emitting the nels , is not gravitationally bound to the recoiling bh and can not follow the bh motion ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence the nels can be used as tracers of the host galaxy recessional velocity . in this scenario ,",
    "the redshift difference between the blue and red sets of lines is caused by relative velocity between the recoiling bh and its host galaxy along the line of sight ( @xmath5 kms@xmath4 in the case of j0927 + 2943 ) .",
    "alternative interpretations have been proposed for this object . @xcite and @xcite have proposed two similar scenarios involving the presence of a sub - parsec bh binary . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 lines are associated with the broad line region of one component of the binary and with lower density gas in the binary sphere of influence , possibly associated with a gas stream fueling the active member ( @xcite ) . in this framework , as for the recoiling case , the nels at @xmath1 set the reference frame of the host galaxy .",
    "+    @xcite and @xcite considered the less exotic interpretation of a chance superposition of two distinct galaxies within the 3@xmath6 angular size of the sdss spectrograph fiber .",
    "in particular , @xcite suggested the presence of a single agn at the redshift of the bels that photoionizes the gas of a smaller galaxy falling toward it , responsible for the @xmath1 nels .",
    "@xcite considered instead the case of two agn , an unobscured type i agn , responsible for the broad and narrow @xmath0 lines , and an obscured type ii agn associated with the other set of lines .    to discriminate among the different scenarios , we study the content and kinematics of the dense molecular gas , as traced by co(21 ) emission .",
    "this allows us to check if the @xmath1 lines actually trace the agn host galaxy frame , as implied by the recoiling and binary scenario .",

    "the other possible scenario proposed for j0927 + 2943 is that of a superposition . in this case",
    "the blue system is associated with the qso while the red system originates in a second distinct structure ( e.g. a second agn or a smaller galaxy illuminated by the qso ) along the same line of sight . in order to boost the otherwise negligible probability of such a chance superposition , the qso is assumed to inhabit a rich galaxy cluster ( @xcite , @xcite ) . under this assumption",
    "@xcite reported the probability of a chance superposition of two agn within @xmath130 ( in order to be observed in the same sdss fiber ) of @xmath131 , so that few chance superpositions are to be expected in the sdss quasar catalogue .",
    "such a prediction has been confirmed through an analysis of the results of the millennium run ( @xcite ) by @xcite .",
    "however these authors find that no high relative velocity chance superposition is expected at @xmath132 , disfavouring the superposition scenario in the specific case of j0927 + 2943 .",
    "the drop in the superposition probability at @xmath133 is related to the low abundance of galaxy clusters at high redshift , as predicted by the hierarchical model of structure formation .",
    "the twin spectrum presented here further constrains the superposition scenario .",
    "the red and blue systems are found to be superimposed within @xmath134 .",
    "hence , the probability estimated by @xcite has to be rescaled by a factor @xmath135 .",
    "within such a small area @xmath136 superimposed agn pair is expected in the sdss database , even considering the effect of clusters . in the _ hst _",
    "image a close ( in projection ) companion disc galaxy ( the ne companion in fig .  [ fig_hst ] ) is clearly visible .",
    "we note that the presence of a companion galaxy with a disturbed morphology in high resolution optical images has been predicted in @xcite .",
    "if involved in a close gravitational interaction , the disc galaxy would be elongated toward the qso thus boosting the chance superposition probability .",
    "however , from the optical and 2 mm spectra we derive that the companion galaxy is associated with a third faint set of emission lines at an intermediate redshift , originally reported by @xcite . the redshift difference between this third line system and the blue one",
    "( i.e. , the qso ) implies a relative velocity of only @xmath137 along the line of sight , hence the companion galaxy can not be responsible for the red line system given that the observed velocity difference is instead @xmath5 .",
    "an alternative option is that the red line system is associated with material stripped from the companion and falling toward the qso .",
    "we can use simple energy conservation arguments to show that this is unlikely , by estimating the maximum velocity such a cloud would acquire in the fall .",
    "generously we optimize the conditions ( i.e. , maximizing the final velocity of the cloud ) by assuming that the cloud falls straight toward the qso subject only to the gravitational potential of the qso host ( e.g. neglecting the deceleration due to the potential well of the companion ) and that the initial separation between the two galaxies is @xmath138 than the qso host scale radius . under these assumptions",
    "we can approximate the energy conservation law as follows : @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the mass and scale radius of the qso host galaxy , @xmath142 is the initial velocity of the cloud when it is tidally stripped from the companion galaxy , and @xmath143 is the cloud velocity after having been accelerated by the qso host . to further maximize @xmath143 we set @xmath144 , i.e. the maximum relative velocity between the qso host and the companion observed in the sub - mm spectrum . despite these extreme assumptions , the qso host should still have an unrealistically high mass of @xmath145 within @xmath146 pc or equivalently @xmath147 within @xmath148 kpc in order to accelerate the cloud to the observed velocity difference between the red and blue systems in the optical spectra , about 1000 less that the observed velocity difference in the optical spectra . ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : env ] we performed a clustering analysis of the qso field , detecting a galaxy overdensity consistent with a rich galaxy group rather than a galaxy cluster .",
    "as discussed above , theoretical arguments as well as the new observations presented here seems to disfavour the superposition scenario .",
    "still , this is the only proposed scenario that has not yet been unambiguosly ruled out by a key observational test .",
    "the projected separation of a possible satellite superimposed on the qso has to be less than @xmath149 making it extremely difficult to resolve the presence of such a system in the near future .",
    "on the other hand , a spectroscopic follow - up of the galaxies with a photometric redshift consistent with that of the qso would improve the characterization of the galaxy overdensity potential .",
    "this could probe the possible presence of a galaxy cluster with an anomalously high dark matter mass to galaxy number ratio needed to justify a high relative velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "however if the velocity dispersion of the galaxies would turn out to be significantly lower than @xmath150 , consistent with the presence of a group , the superposition scenario would then be ruled out as well as the recoil and binary scenarios , leaving the nature of j0927 + 2943 still an open issue .",
