    "@xcite first pointed out that star formation in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) happens surprisingly slowly . comparing",
    "the mass of gmcs in the galaxy with the total galactic star formation rate implies that no more than @xmath0 of the gas can form stars for each cloud free - fall time .",
    "this result is sufficiently surprising that numerous theories have been proposed to explain it , ranging from the idea that strong magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within clouds inhibit star formation to the idea that galactic - scale gravitational instability regulates star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the idea that gmcs are , contrary to most observational estimates to date @xcite , actually gravitationally unbound ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite , we define the dimensionless star formation rate per free - fall time @xmath1 as the fraction of an object s mass that it converts into stars per free - fall time at the mean density of that object .",
    "the @xcite argument shows that @xmath2 for gmcs .",
    "this provides a powerful constraint on models of gmcs .",
    "for example , it rules out the early gmc model of @xcite , a simplified version of which is that gmcs are spheres of gas of density @xmath3 that are in free - fall collapse .",
    "the clouds reach a singularity in a time @xmath4^{1/2}$ ] , at which point their mass is converted into stars . for a population of such clouds @xmath5 , which is inconsistent with the @xcite result .",
    "an important observational question , and a crucial test for theories of how star formation is regulated , is to what densities and length scales @xmath1 remains much smaller than unity . in other words , is there a density at which something like the @xcite free - fall collapse model becomes reasonable ? as an example , consider observing a star - forming region using a molecular tracer sensitive to gas at densities of @xmath6 @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , to estimate the total mass of gas at such high densities .",
    "this is larger than the mean density of `` cores '' seen both observationally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in simulations of star formation regulated by turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is roughly the density at which models of magnetically - regulated star formation predict that gas will completely decouple from the magnetic field and enter free - fall collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". at such high densities protostellar outflows can probably stop at most half the gas from reaching a star @xcite , and the thermal pressure in gas at @xmath9 @xmath7 is considerably higher than the typical ram pressure of the turbulence in gmcs , so gas at such high densities is largely impervious to external perturbations .",
    "thus , regardless of the model of star formation one adopts , one would expect that almost all of the gas at densities @xmath10 @xmath7 is part of gravitationally - bound , collapsing objects that have largely decoupled from the background turbulent flow . in the absence of effective internal support or external disturbance , order unity of",
    "the gas at such high densities is likely to be incorporated into a star within one free - fall time .",
    "for this reason , essentially all models of star formation predict that the total mass of gas at densities @xmath10 @xmath7 , divided by the free - fall time of this gas , should yield a value comparable to the total star formation rate in the region over which the mass is measured . instead of @xmath11 as for gmcs ,",
    "i.e. slow star formation , one would obtain @xmath12 , i.e. rapid star formation .",
    "however , different models make different predictions about the shape of the curve of @xmath1 versus density in between @xmath0 at the characteristic density of gmcs , @xmath13 @xmath7 , and @xmath14 at a density @xmath10 @xmath7 .",
    "these different predictions correspond to different models of the physical scale at which gas both decouples from the background flow and ceases to be supported by internal feedback mechanisms , and thus transitions from slow to rapid star formation . at one extreme ,",
    "magnetic regulation models such as those of @xcite , neglecting for the moment turbulent enhancement of the ambipolar diffusion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , predict that star formation only becomes rapid once gas decouples from the magnetic field , a process that does not even begin until densities of @xmath15 @xmath7 . at the other extreme ,",
    "@xcite argue that star clusters form from gas clumps at densities of @xmath16 @xmath7 that undergo a free - fall collapse in which at least @xmath17 of their mass is converted into stars @xcite , so star formation should be rapid at this density or higher . in this model , the decoupling scale corresponds to the transition from globally unbound structures ( gmcs ) to globally bound structures ( protoclusters ) .",
    "thus , extending the @xcite calculation of star formation rate divided by free - fall time to higher densities , in hopes of identifying a scale at which there is a transition from slow to rapid star formation , provides a means of distinguishing between models of how star formation is regulated .",
    "it is important at this point to differentiate the concepts of the _ rate _ and _ efficiency _ of star formation , and the _ lifetime _ of star - forming clouds .",
    "unfortunately these terms are often confused in the literature , and there are no standard definitions , so we describe here the definitions we use in this paper .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath18 is the easiest to define , since it is simply the instantaneous conversion rate of gas into stars within some volume .",
    "if we pick a density threshold @xmath3 , we can then define the dimensionless star formation rate per free - fall time for the gas above that density threshold , @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the mass of material inside the volume of density @xmath3 or greater .",
    "in contrast , the lifetime @xmath21 of star - forming cloud is somewhat more ambiguous .",
    "we take it to mean the total duration during which a cloud is visible in a tracer sensitive to densities of @xmath3 or more .",
    "note that our definition neglects the complication that something that starts as a single cloud may in the course of its evolution break up into multiple pieces , so the visible lifetime and the dynamical lifetime may be different . finally , by the efficiency @xmath22 we mean the fraction of gas mass @xmath20 that is converted into stars by a cloud over its lifetime @xmath23 .",
    "again , we neglect the complication that clouds are not closed boxes , so @xmath20 is likely to be time - dependent due to continuing accretion or mass loss .",
    "ideally @xmath22 should be computed using a lagrangian definition of the cloud mass , i.e.  all the mass that reached density @xmath3 or more at some point .",
    "however , this is generally not a direct observable .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the rate , efficiency , and lifetime are related by @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , one can define a rough time - averaged value for @xmath1 in a cloud @xmath25 $ ] , i.e.  the mass fraction converted into stars divided by the cloud lifetime in free - fall times .",
    "one could also describe @xmath26 as being the efficiency per free - fall time , since it measures a fraction of mass converted into stars .",
    "however , we refer to it as a rate because it is measured in amount per unit time , whereas efficiency in the literature most commonly refers to the total fraction of mass converted into stars , not the amount per unit time . moreover ,",
    "since the time - averaged definition is ambiguous anyway due to uncertainties in exactly what is meant by the efficiency and the lifetime , we will generally use the instantaneous value of @xmath1 , which is well defined and , as we show , directly observable .",
    "the reason for making all these definitions explicit it to point out that observational constraints on @xmath1 by themselves do not directly constraint @xmath27 or @xmath28 , and vice versa .",
    "numerous authors have used various observational techniques to estimate @xmath27 in clusters and gmcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , with the exception of   [ clustertime ] , we will not discuss the question of cloud lifetime at all in this paper .",
    "when we refer to rapid versus slow star formation , what we mean is @xmath12 or @xmath29 , not is @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "these questions are conceptually distinct . as an example , note that in the @xcite picture of gmcs as collapsing spheres , the evolution time scale is always the cloud free - fall time , @xmath32 .",
    "however , the model still gives @xmath5 , and we would therefore describe it as a rapid star formation .",
    "in contrast , @xcite argue that star formation lasts only one crossing time of a molecular cloud , so again @xmath33 , but that during this time only @xmath0 of the mass turns into stars .",
    "we would describe this as slow star formation , since @xmath34 , even though the cloud evolution time is similar to that in the @xcite model .",
    "the @xcite argument rules out the @xcite free - fall collapse model for gmcs , but is consistent with the @xcite model .",
    "thus , we emphasize that _ in this paper we remain completely agnostic on the question of molecular cloud lifetime_.    in this paper we consider star formation in several classes of object . infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) are regions of high extinction seen in absorption against the galactic infrared background @xcite .",
    "irdcs are clearly associated with star formation , and in at least some cases irdcs have massive protostars embedded within them @xcite .",
    "several authors have suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that irdcs are the progenitors of star clusters . within irdcs , at still higher densities ,",
    "are dense molecular clumps .",
    "these objects may be observed in a variety of molecular transitions with high critical densities , and we consider two here : hcn(1 - 0 ) @xcite and cs(5 - 4 ) @xcite .",
    "molecular clumps seen in these two transitions are often associated with water masers and other signs of massive , clustered star formation .",
    "our goal is to determine @xmath1 for each of these increasingly dense gas tracers .",
    "we also determine this quantity for the orion nebula cluster using a completely different method , which provides an independent check on our estimates .",
    "the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows : in   [ sfrest ] we use a variety of observations to derive @xmath1 for our objects and construct a plot of @xmath1 versus characteristic density to search for signs of a transition from slow to fast star formation . in   [ implications ] , we compare our results to theoretical models for the regulation of star formation , and also point out some implications for the process of star cluster formation . finally , in   [ conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions , and suggest directions for future work .",
    "let @xmath35 be the total star formation rate in a galaxy , and consider star formation occuring in objects of class x. let @xmath36 be the fraction of galactic star formation that occurs in these objects , @xmath37 be their total mass in the galaxy , and @xmath38 be their typical free - fall time .",
    "then @xmath39 in this section we use observations to estimate all the factors on the right hand side , and thus determine the dimensionless star formation rate @xmath40 in several classes of object .",
    "we emphasize that , as we vary the typical density of the objects we consider , both @xmath38 and @xmath37 will vary  as we go to denser and denser clouds , the free - fall time will decline , pushing @xmath40 downward , but the amount of mass in objects of that density will also decrease , pushing @xmath1 back up .",
    "ultimately , we wish to determine which of these two effects dominate , or whether they roughly balance .",
    "in addition to determining a best value for @xmath40 , we also attempt to make a rough estimate our uncertainties by estimating the uncertainty on each parameter in equation ( [ sfrffeqn ] ) .",
    "we do this from data where possible and from more general considerations where not , and we add the uncertainty factors in quadrature .",
    "this method of combining errors is formally appropriate only if the errors are independent and gaussian - distributed , neither of which are likely to be completely true , but the procedure does give us a sense of by how much our estimates could vary .",
    "the unknown on the right hand side of ( [ sfrffeqn ] ) that has been studied most heavily is the star formation rate .",
    "numerous authors have discussed methods of inferring the star formation rate from various observables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , so here we only summarize aspects of this discussion that we will apply directly in what follows",
    ".      in the milky way , @xcite find @xmath41 @xmath42 yr@xmath43 based on catalogs of galactic hii regions .",
    "star formation is distributed in an exponential disk with scale radius @xmath44 kpc and sharp cutoffs at 3 kpc and 11 kpc in galactocentric radius . for this distribution ,",
    "approximately @xmath45 of galactic star formation occurs within the solar circle . the dominant uncertainty in this estimate , roughly 0.3 dex @xcite , is the shape of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , since hii regions only trace the massive stellar population and one must extrapolate to estimate the total mass .",
    "estimates of the star formation rate based on chemical modelling @xcite also give star formation rates consistent with 3 @xmath42 yr@xmath43 to within a factor of 2 .      for external galaxies ,",
    "a commonly - used tracer of star formation is far - infrared ( fir ) light . while fir is usually not the preferred tracer of star formation in normal spiral galaxies like the milky way , it is detectable over a very wide range of sources , from ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) to individual cluster - forming clumps in the milky way , making it possible to look for correlations over a wide range of luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite finds that in optically - thick starbursts the ir luminosity and star - formation rate are related by @xmath46 the dominant uncertainty is the age of the stellar population , but as we discuss in more detail below , for extragalactic sources this is only @xmath17 .",
    "the uncertainty is considerably larger in normal spiral galaxies , where old stellar populations contribute a significant luminosity , and where only a fraction of the light is reprocessed into infrared .",
    "based on comparisons of multiple tracers of the star formation rate in a range of galaxy types , @xcite find that ( [ irsfrconversion ] ) probably underestimates the star formation rate in normal spirals .",
    "we instead adopt @xmath47 in normal spirals , which is approximately consistent with the mean in the sample of @xcite for low star - formation rate ( @xmath48 @xmath42 yr@xmath43 ) systems .",
    "there is , however , a much larger scatter in this relation than in the corresponding relation for starburst systems .",
    "several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use infrared luminosities to estimate the star formation rates within individual cluster - forming gas clumps in the milky way .",
    "these objects have very high surface densities , so essentially all the light is reprocessed into ir and the uncertainty for spiral galaxies does not apply .",
    "however , we will not directly compare to these data because there is a much larger uncertainty arising from the age of the stellar population . in systems @xmath49 myr old",
    "no stars have disappeared through supernovae , so the massive stellar population can not yet have reached equilibrium between formation and destruction .    to study the magnitude of the uncertainty that this effect induces , we use starburst99 version 5.0 @xcite to compute the evolution of light to star formation rate and light to mass ratios for systems with constant star formation rates .",
    "figure [ lt ] shows the results .",
    "the dashed lines show models using the @xcite imf , while the dotted lines use an imf with the @xcite slope of @xmath50 from 0.1 @xmath42 to 120 @xmath42 ; for all other starburst99 parameters , we use the defaults . as the plot shows , at ages of a few myr or more ,",
    "the luminosity per unit star formation rate is quite insensitive to both age and imf , so luminosity is a good indicator of star formation rate .",
    "however , at younger ages the luminosity in the starburst99 calculation traces total stellar mass more closely than star formation rate , so the light is not a good indicator of star formation rate",
    ".    one might think it possible to break this degeneracy by independently determining the age of the stellar population , and then using the luminosity to infer the stellar mass and thus the star formation rate .",
    "however , a more detailed treatment of very young systems than starburst99 provides shows that infrared observations alone are not sufficient to constrain the stellar mass in systems @xmath51 myr old . in such young systems , a significant fraction of the stars",
    "may not yet have contracted to the main sequence , in which case they will be more luminous than equal mass stars on the main sequence would be .",
    "accretion luminosity may further enhance the radiative output above what would be found for a non - accreting population of the same mass .",
    "there are also factors that reduce the luminous output compared to an older population of the same mass .",
    "massive stars require @xmath52 myr to assemble @xcite , so systems younger than this will be missing their contribution to the light . in systems of @xmath53 @xmath42 or less",
    ", poor sampling of the massive tail of the stellar imf produces a large scatter , and causes the median system to be less luminous per unit mass or per unit star formation rate than a larger population would be .",
    "we explore how these effects change the light output of a young cluster using the model of @xcite . in figure",
    "[ lt ] , the solid lines show the light output from a simulated cluster with a final stellar mass of @xmath54 @xmath42 forming at a constant star formation rate of @xmath55 @xmath42 yr@xmath43 .",
    "this model uses the same imf we use for the salpeter - slope starburst99 calculation ( the dotted line in the figure ) , but it includes accretion luminosity , pre - main sequence evolution , finite star formation times , and discrete sampling of the imf .",
    "it does not include any post - main sequence evolution .",
    "the thick central line shows the median of 400 runs with different samplings of the imf , and the thin lines above and below it show the tracks that bound @xmath56 of the runs .",
    "as the plots show , the median cluster @xmath51 myr in age will be much less luminous per unit star formation rate than a galactic stellar population that is @xmath57 myr old and contains enough stars to fully sample the imf , but the spread can be an order of magnitude for a 1000 @xmath42 cluster . as the cluster mass increases the effects of discrete sampling decrease , causing the luminosity spread to decrease and the median to rise . even for clusters massive enough to sample the full imf , though , neither the light to mass ratio nor the light to star formation rate ratio stay constant at ages @xmath51 myr , so light is a poor indicator of either stellar mass or star formation rate .    while we can not use infrared luminosity to study the star formation rate in galactic star - forming gas clumps directly , there is an observational correlation between infrared and molecular luminosity for such objects @xcite from which we can learn a great deal .",
    "we discuss how to interpret this correlation in light of our results in   [ clustertime ] .",
    "finally , note that there are few star clusters where one can estimate the star formation rate directly by placing a large number of stars on the hr diagram and using pre - main sequence tracks to estimate the cluster mass and age spread ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since this requires luminosity and temperature determinations for many stars , it is posssible only in systems without too much extinction , which limits this technique to low density regions ( e.g. taurus ) or somewhat older regions where most of the initial gas is gone ( e.g. the orion nebula cluster , onc ) .",
    "we discuss the onc in more detail in ",
    "[ oncsec ] , and also refer readers to @xcite for a detailed discussion of other techniques by which one may estimate the formation times of star clusters .      as discussed above , irdcs are likely to be the progenitors of star clusters .",

    "this enables us to compute the star formation rate per free fall time in irdcs by comparing to the total star formation rate in the inner galaxy , roughly @xmath58 @xmath42 yr@xmath43 with a factor of 2 uncertainty .",
    "we should note that our calculation of the star formation rate in irdcs is entirely different from the one given @xcite .",
    "their estimate assumes an unknown time scale and efficiency of star formation .",
    "the calculation we give here does not rely on any such assumptions .",
    "first we must estimate the fraction of star formation that occurs in irdcs .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath59 of galactic star formation occurs in clusters .",
    "if a cloud were visible during the entire star formation process as an irdc , this would imply @xmath60 .",
    "however , clouds that have too many embedded protostars will not be infrared dark , and will therefore cease to be visible as irdcs .",
    "this probably does not occur until most of the stars have formed , though , so we adopt @xmath61 as a reasonable guess , while acknowledging that it could be a bit smaller .",
    "being slighly more conservative about our uncertainty than @xcite , we adopt @xmath62 as the plausible range of possibilities , i.e.  anywhere from 60% to 100% of star formation inside the solar circle takes place in irdcs , corresponding to a factor of 1.25 uncertainty on our estimate of @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 gives the largest possible value of @xmath1 for irdcs , so any uncertainties that move @xmath65 out of our plausible range can only make @xmath1 smaller , not larger .",
    "@xcite find that the total mass of irdcs in the inner galaxy is @xmath66 @xmath42 based on the measured properties of a sub - sample of irdcs observed in 1.2 mm continuum emission , and an estimate of the detection efficiency for the msx irdc survey @xcite .",
    "this mass estimate is probably uncertain by a factor of several , because it is unclear how representative the clouds surveyed by @xcite are of the entire irdc population .",
    "the sample consists of the darkest clouds ( darkness measures a combination of column density and degree of background illumination ) from a sample with known kinematic distances .",
    "this selection introduces an unknown bias in the mass estimate , so we consider the irdc mass estimate to be uncertain by factors of a few .",

    "for the 38 irdcs in the sample of @xcite , we define an effective radius @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the angular area within the @xmath70 detection threshold of the cloud taken from the catalog of @xcite , and @xmath71 is the distance estimate taken from rathborne et al .",
    "we take the mean density to be @xmath72 .",
    "this procedure is fairly uncertain , since the location of the @xmath70 contour depends on the background emission , and the morphology is filamentary rather than round for a significant minority of clouds . nonetheless , we can make a rough estimate for @xmath3 and @xmath73 , and check for any systematic variations with irdc size .",

    "this is a lower limit only , because the maser catalog may not be complete over the region of sky it covers , there is probably at least some galactic cs(5 - 4 ) emission that is not correlated with water masers , and @xcite only detect 75% of their targets in cs(5 - 4 ) , while they detect 90% in all the transitions for which they look .",
    "nonetheless , this lower limit on luminosity gives a lower limit on the amount of gas in the galaxy that is sufficiently dense to produce cs(5 - 4 ) emission , which we can in turn use in equation ( [ sfrffeqn ] ) to obtain an upper limit on @xmath1 at cs densities .",
    "first we must estimate the cs(5 - 4 ) `` x '' factor to convert the luminosity to a mass . like hcn(1 - 0 ) , star - forming clumps are usually optically thick in cs(5 - 4 ) , so it is reasonable to expect that such an x factor might exist .",
    "figure [ mvirlcs ] shows the virial mass @xmath110 ( determined from optically - thin c@xmath89s emission ) versus @xmath111 for the 57 objects in the @xcite sample .",
    "the correlation is well fit by the line @xmath112 over more than two orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "this implies a total galactic mass in cs clumps of @xmath113 @xmath42 .",
    "the uncertainty of the fit , done in the logarithm of the data , is a factor of 3.3 , and we adopt this as the uncertainty in our luminosity to mass correlation .",
    "however , as we discuss more below , the virial mass gives the lowest mass of the three estimators tested by @xcite , by roughly a factor of 3 , so the true mass is much more likely to be larger than our value rather than smaller .    note that this mass estimate strongly suggests that the true cs mass in the milky way is substantially larger .",
    "cs and hcn emission often come from overlapping regions in the milky way @xcite , and in such overlapping regions the area emitting cs is not vastly smaller than the area emitting hcn . however , the total mass of cs gas that our estimate suggests is smaller than the mass of hcn - emitting gas that @xcite see in galaxies like the milky way by @xmath114 orders of magnitude .",
    "the most likely explanation is incompleteness of the cs survey .    to estimate the free - fall time",
    ", we must know the gas density .",
    "@xcite , based on radiative transfer modeling , find a mean density of @xmath115 @xmath7 , roughly the critical density .",
    "however , this average is intensity - weighted , so it may overestimate the true mean . @xcite and @xcite find that the virial mass for objects in their survey is systematically smaller than the mass estimated by assuming that all the gas is at the density inferred from the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "based on the difference in mass estimates , they conclude that the filling factor of gas at densities of @xmath116 @xmath7 or higher is typically @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the density of @xmath115 @xmath7 probably represents an upper limit on the true density .",
    "we therefore compute the mean density for the 57 clumps in the shirley et al .",
    "catalog from the virial mass and deconvolved half - peak radius ( shirley et al.s @xmath118 ) to compare to the result of the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "we show our derived densities and the corresponding free - fall times in figure [ tffcs ] .",
    "the mass - weighted harmonic mean free - fall time for the cs clumps ( computed from equation [ harmonicmean ] ) is @xmath119 myr , and we adopt this as our fiducial value .",
    "the range @xmath120 myr covers the central 67% of the free - fall times , so we take the uncertainty to be a factor of 2 .",
    "the density corresponding to our adopted mean free - fall time is @xmath121 @xmath7 , and the range in free - fall times corresponds to a density range of a factor of 1.4 .",
    "finally , the estimated cs luminosity comes from sources associated with water masers , which arise only in regions of massive , clustered star formation .",
    "this implies a maximum of @xmath122 .",
    "alternately , we would obtain the same result by assuming that all star - forming regions produce cs(5 - 4 ) emission and raising our estimate of @xmath123 by a factor of @xmath124 to account for the fraction of cs(5 - 4 ) emission associated with water masers . in either case ,",
    "our value for either @xmath125 or @xmath123 is an upper limit because we do not know what fraction of clustered star formation is associated with water maser emission .",
    "combining @xmath125 , @xmath123 , and @xmath126 in equation ( [ sfrffeqn ] ) gives @xmath127 , with an uncertainty of a factor of 3.6 .",
    "again , it seems likely that the true value is significantly lower than this upper limit .",
    "we can add one more point for a specific object .",
    "the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) is the only star cluster that has been studied well enough so that it is possible to make reasonable estimates of the stellar mass , the formation time , and the properties of the progenitor gas system , allowing direct determination of @xmath1 .",
    "this is quite useful because it provides an estimate of @xmath1 that does not depend on conversions from luminosities to masses or star formation rates , and thus is subject to completely different systematic errors than the methods we have used thus far .",
    "the total stellar mass of the onc is 4600 @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyze several lines of evidence to conclude that formation of the onc took place over at least @xmath128 myr , and possibly longer ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the age estimate comes from a combination of pre - main sequence fitting , which is fairly reliable for stars @xmath129 myr in age , and from the age of a dynamical ejection event .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for the detailed evidence .",
    "the free - fall time in the current stellar system is @xmath130 myr , but it must have been smaller in the progenitor gas system , since some of the mass has been expelled by the trapezium stars , and the cluster may be expanding .",
    "uncertainties in these processes lead to a range of mass estimates for the progenitor , ranging from @xmath131 @xmath42 if the onc today is marginally unbound and expanding @xcite to @xmath132 @xmath42 if the onc is currently bound and non - expanding @xcite , although the latter would imply an extraordinarily high star formation efficiency .",
    "if we neglect the possibility that the cluster has undergone significant expansion since expelling its gas , this implies that the free - fall time in the progenitor gas system was @xmath133 myr , corresponding to a density @xmath134 @xmath7 .",
    "it seems unlikely that star formation began when most of the gas in the onc was spread over a much larger region at lower density , both because there is no correlation between the age and spatial distribution for stars in the onc @xcite and because there must have been a system sufficiently dense to lead to dynamical interactions and ejection of massive stars 2.5 myr ago @xcite .",
    "combining the initial gas mass , final stellar mass , and initial free - fall time implies that in orion @xmath135 .",
    "the true value is likely to be towards the low end of this range , since even if the onc is bound it has almost certainly undergone some expansion from its original gaseous state , meaning that the free - fall time we have adopted is probably too large .",
    "we summarize our results by plotting the dimensionless star formation rate @xmath1 versus characteristic density in figure [ sfrffn ] .",
    "in addition to our points for cs clumps , hcn clumps , irdcs , and the onc , we can add a point for gmcs as a whole , in which the typical density and free - fall time are @xmath136 @xmath7 and @xmath137 myr @xcite .",
    "the total mass of gmcs in the galaxy is roughly @xmath138 @xmath42 @xcite , so using the same argument as in   [ irdcsfr ] gives @xmath139 .",
    "@xcite give a much more detailed calculation of this value , but for simplicity we adopt rough numbers here .",
    "since the gmc population in the milky way is reasonably well characterized , the uncertainty in @xmath1 is dominated by uncertainty in the star formation rate , so it is about a factor of 2 . the range of densities covered by star - forming gmcs is roughly a factor of 3 , so we take this range and the range in @xmath1 to roughly define our uncertainty for gmcs .",
    "the star formation rate per free - fall time is a key prediction of any model for a physical mechanism that regulates the star formation rate .",
    "the most important result summarized by figure [ sfrffn ] , which any successful theory must be able to explain , is that there is no evidence for a transition to rapid star formation out to densities of @xmath140 @xmath7 .",
    "even given the large uncertainties in the data , this conclusion is quite firm . if any of the objects we have analyzed were bound , detatched from the large - scale turbulent flow , and collapsing without significant impedance from feedback , we would expect @xmath12 , while even the top of the uncertainty range for the data point with the highest value of @xmath1 is below 0.1 .",
    "only the cs data is consistent with a transition for rapid star formation , and this is an upper limit for which there is strong evidence to suggest that the true value is significantly lower .",
    "a second conclusion , which is much more tentative , is that we do not see any significant change in @xmath1 with density at all . given the uncertainties , obviously we are insensitive to changes in @xmath1 smaller than roughly an order of magnitude , and the somewhat higher point for the onc suggests that it is possible there is some modest rise in @xmath1 in star clusters .",
    "any such rise with density , though , must be fairly small over the range of density we have explored . in summary , the data are _ consistent _ with @xmath1 of a few percent regardless of density , and _ require _ @xmath141 to densities of at least @xmath142 @xmath7 .",
    "the characteristic scale at which one transitions from slow to fast star formation must lie at even higher densities . here",
    "we investigate how well various models of star formation explain this result , and discuss a few of its implications .",
    "one proposed explanation for the low star formation rate in molecular clouds is that gmcs are not bound by gravity @xcite . in this model ,",
    "gmcs are transient over - densities created by turbulence or spiral shocks in the atomic ism .",
    "since they are confined by ram pressure , they re - expand and disperse in roughly one dynamical time .",
    "the star formation rate appears low because only a small fraction of the mass is gravitationally bound and can collapse , but that mass which can collapse will form stars rapidly .",
    "feedback is not effective at slowing collapse or establishing an equilibrium , and only stops the star formation process at its end by rapidly unbinding the cluster @xcite .",
    "star formation in protoclusters is rapid but is halted after a short period by feedback .",
    "thus , the star formation rate is high , even if the duration is short , and this should be detectable as a rise in @xmath1 at the typical density of protoclusters .",
    "simulations based on these premises allow us to compare these models to the observational data . before discussing individual simulations",
    ", we note that we can not analyze the simulation data as thoroughly as we have analyzed the observational data .",
    "ideally , one would take a snapshot of a simulation at various points in time , compute the mass @xmath20 that is denser than @xmath3 , make a plot of @xmath143 , and compare that to the instantaneous star formation rate in the simulation .",
    "this is effectively what we have done with the observational data .",
    "however , simulation papers generally do not report @xmath20 .",
    "they only give a single density , usually the initial ( uniform ) density , and report a total mass of stars formed over the course of the entire simulation .",
    "thus we perform our calculations using @xmath20 for the initial density at the initial time , and compare the mean star formation rate over the entire simulation . this should give a rough average value that can stand in for a more detailed calculation of @xmath143 as a function of density and time .",
    "however , we encourage authors of future simulations of gmc evolution or star cluster formation to compute @xmath143 for at least a few time slices to facilitate comparison to observations .",
    "@xcite estimate from their simulations that unbound gmcs would convert @xmath144 of their mass into stars in @xmath145 free - fall times , giving @xmath146 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite simulate a marginally - bound @xmath54 @xmath42 clump with an initial radius of @xmath147 pc , giving @xmath148 @xmath7 , roughly the properties of an hcn clump .",
    "there is no feedback , and the turbulence decays freely .",
    "they find that , after @xmath149 initial free - fall times , @xmath150 of the mass has gone into stars , giving @xmath151 .",
    "this is probably an underestimate of the true value of @xmath1 in this scenario , since the simulation starts with a uniform density and thus star formation does not really begin for roughly 1 free - fall time . if we instead measured from the time when the first star formed to the time when the last one formed , we would find an even larger value of @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with other simulations in which the turbulence is weak .",
    "for example , @xcite model formation of a star cluster by simulating a periodic box in which the gravitational potential energy greatly exceeds the kinetic energy , and find that their simulation converts @xmath152 of the initial mass into stars in 1.8 free - fall times , giving @xmath153 .",
    "the simulation is scale - free , but klessen & burkert suggest that the model should be reasonable for a region with a typical density of @xmath154 @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite perform a parameter study of regions with turbulent driving of various strengths and find that when the turbulent driving is weak so that the system is unstable to global collapse , @xmath155 is a typical value .",
    "( as we discuss below in   [ virturb ] , @xcite find that if the turbulent driving is strong , the simulations produce lower values of @xmath1 that agree much better with the observations . )",
    "we place points from the simulations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and from one of the weakly - driven turbulence simulations of @xcite , on figure [ sfrffn ] .",
    "this indicates a clear observational problem for these models .",
    "they produce roughly the correct star formation rate at the gmc scale , but are inconsistent with the data on the irdc and hcn scale at the order of magnitude level .",
    "they are consistent with the cs data only if the value of @xmath1 in cs clumps is near its upper limit .",
    "we conclude that models where star formation occurs in unbound gmcs but freely collapsing dense clumps , or where the turbulence in those clumps is driven but at very sub - virial levels , are ruled out by the data .",
    "star formation in dense clumps can not occur through global collapse .",
    "we emphasize again that one can not avoid this problem by hypothesizing a feedback process that rapidly destroys clumps once they have turned a relatively small fraction of their mass into stars , but retaining the picture of star formation occuring in clumps that are undergoing global collapse . even if feedback destroyed collapsing clumps , while they existed they would still be forming stars at a rate much larger than @xmath1 of a few percent , which is inconsistent with the data .",
    "only if destruction by feedback prevents global collapse from starting can it produce the observed value of @xmath1 .",
    "in this case , though , estimates that cluster - forming clumps turn @xmath17 of their gas into stars @xcite require that global collapse be held off for much longer than a free - fall time .",
    "we discuss the implications of this in more detail in   [ clustertime ] .",
    "one final caveat worth mentioning in our interpretation of these simulations is that once a significant fraction of the particles in an sph simulation have been accreted by sink particles , the effective resolution of that code , and its ability to follow the hydrodynamics , may be significantly degraded .",
    "it is unclear how large this effect is , and whether it would tend to increase or decrease @xmath1 .",
    "however , since the effect is only a problem late in the simulations , it seems unlikely that it could shift @xmath1 by more than a few percent .",
    "the criticism of unbound gmc models applies in a much weaker form to models in which the star formation rate is determined by large - scale global gravitational instability in a galactic disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models postulate that the star formation rate in galaxies is determined by the rate at which gravitational instability in the galactic disk drives gas to high densities , and that the strength of this gravitational instability determines the star formation rate .",
    "this is probably at least partly true , in that the star formation rate is set partly by the supply of molecular gas , which is in turn controlled by gravitational instability .",
    "however , roughly one third of the mass of the milky way s ism is in molecular clouds .",
    "clearly the rate - limiting step in star formation is not at the stage of converting atomic ism to molecular gas , but somewhere at higher density .",
    "for this reason , the gravitational instability models provide only a partial description of the star formation process .    in practice , this limitation is reflected in the star formation prescriptions that simulations of galactic - scale gravitational instability adopt .",
    "these simulations can not resolve structures of molecular cloud size or smaller . instead ,",
    "when such structures form the simulations use a recipe to determine the amount of gas that turns into stars .",
    "these prescriptions only reproduce the correct star formation rate if they correspond to rates @xmath156 in the dense gas .",
    "for example , @xcite assume for their highest resolution simulations that in cells with densities above @xmath157 @xmath7 , 50% of the gas is converted into stars per free - fall time of that gas .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath158 .",
    "however , examining their figure 8 shows that this leads to a star formation rate that is an order of magnitude larger than the observed @xcite law without feedback , and a half an order of magnitude too large if they include feedback .",
    "they also find that even reducing their value of @xmath1 by a factor of 10 is not by itself sufficient to reproduce the kennicutt law .",
    "this is not surprising based on our results that @xmath1 is at most a few percent in gas at densities of @xmath157 @xmath7 .",
    "reproducing the observed star formation law would require a value for @xmath1 of this order .    in the simulations of @xcite , the authors are able to reproduce the @xcite law by adopting a prescription for star formation",
    "whereby collapsed mass is assumed to form stars with a 30% `` efficiency '' , in the sense that they count @xmath159 of the gas that is accreted onto sink particles in the simulation as stars .",
    "the remaining 70% of the mass stays in the sink particles , but is assumed not to form stars .",
    "there is no simple way to convert this recipe into a value of @xmath1 , since it specifies that the star formation rate in any particle is 30% of the particle s current accretion rate , and we do not have available the full time history of accretion for each particle .",
    "even if we did have this information , interpretation would be diffuclt because the gas assumed not to form stars remains locked up in sink particles indefinitely , rather than being ejected back into the ism by feedback as happens in real star clusters .",
    "this greatly reduces the supply of gas available to form stars . nonetheless , the fact that these simulations need to adopt a subgrid model that significantly reduces the collapsed mass counted as stars in order to reproduce the @xcite law is consistent with our point that one can only explain the observed rates of star formation if there is some mechanism that inhibits star formation even in the densest gas that the simulations can resolve .",
    "the reason that these simulations reproduce the observed star formation rate only if they have @xmath156 is clear in light of figure [ sfrffn ] : if the gas in irdcs or hcn gas were collapsing on its free - fall time , the star formation rate in the milky way would exceed the observed value by two orders of magnitude . to obtain the correct overall star formation rate",
    ", one must adopt a star formation rate @xmath156 even in the densest gas that the simulations are currently capable of resolving .",
    "while this is an entirely reasonable approach in simulations , a theoretical understanding of the star formation rate requires an explanation why @xmath156 even in gas that is already collapsed to densities above the critical density of hcn(1 - 0 ) , five orders of magnitude higher than the mean in the galactic ism .",
    "this point does not mean that global gravitational instability is unimportant in regulating star formation , simply that it can not be the sole agent .",
    "thus , models such as these are complementary to models of @xmath1 in dense gas such as those of @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation for low star formation rates is strong magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if star - forming clouds are magnetically subcritical , which is controversial on both observational and theoretical grounds @xcite , then they can not collapse before ambipolar diffusion allows the magnetic field to slip out of the gas , and star formation proceeds on the ambipolar diffusion time scale instead of the free - fall time scale . for a uniform gas ,",
    "the time scale required for ambipolar diffusion to decouple the gas and the field is @xcite @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath3 are the characteristic size scale and density of the cloud , @xmath162 is the alfvn speed , @xmath163 @xmath164 g@xmath43 s@xmath43 is the ion - neutral drag coefficient , and @xmath165 @xmath166 g@xmath167 is the cosmic ray ionization constant .",
    "( in high column density environments like irdcs , interstellar uv photons can not penetrate and ionization is dominated by cosmic rays . )",
    "if we assume that this describes the star formation timescale , then the star formation rate should obey roughly @xcite @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the fraction of the mass in a prestellar core that reaches the star rather than being ejected by outflows @xcite .    to determine what this implies for @xmath1",
    ", we need to know how the magnetic field behaves in objects of varying densities . while there are very few direct observations of magnetic fields for extremely dense objects of the sort we are considering",
    ", observations do show that magnetic fields obey the correlation @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the velocity dispersion of the region , @xmath172 is the ratio of the object s mass - to - flux ratio to the critical value @xmath173 , @xmath174 is a constant of order unity the depends on the cloud s internal density distribution , and @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "this correlation is what one would expect if , in one direction , cloud self - gravity were balanced by magnetic plus turbulent pressure .",
    "if we use this correlation in ( [ sfrffmag ] ) , and re - write the relation in terms of the virial parameter @xmath176 , we find that all the dependence on dimensional quantities drops out and we are left with @xmath177    the uncertainty of this calculation is probably more than an order of magnitude , so we should not pay particular attention to the coefficient , and we will not attempt to place points for magnetic regulation models on figure [ sfrffn ] .",
    "major contributors to the uncertainty are ambiguities in the definition of the length and mass scales @xmath161 and @xmath178 , the lack of three - dimensional numerical simulations to determine how well equation ( [ sfrffmag ] ) holds on scales larger than a core collapsing to form a single star system , and the possibility that the cosmic ray ionization rate may vary substantially between galaxies . perhaps most significantly ,",
    "equation ( [ tadest ] ) assumes that ambipolar diffusion in a turbulent medium is not substantially faster than in a quiescent one , an assumption that may well fail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if turbulence shortens the ambipolar diffusion time scale so that @xmath179 , as some simulations suggest it might , then magnetic regulation models would produce a value of @xmath1 that is too high . whether this occurs or not is a question that will have to be addressed through three - dimensional simulations with self - gravity and non - ideal mhd .    given these uncertainties , we can not really say whether the rate of star formation in magnetically subcritical clouds subject to ambipolar diffusion is quantitatively consistent with the observations .",
    "however , the lack of dependence of @xmath1 on any properties but the virial parameter implies that we expect the magnetic @xmath1 to be roughly the same in all virialized objects , a prediction we can compare to observations . for our observed objects , we know that gmcs with masses @xmath180 @xmath42 , hcn clumps , and cs clumps are roughly virialized @xcite , so @xmath181 for them .",
    "for irdcs we lack kinematic information from optically thin molecular emission , and therefore we can not directly determine the velocity dispersion and the virial parameter .",
    "if we assume that these objects are virialized , then the magnetic regulation model is broadly consistent with observations that @xmath1 is roughly constant .",
    "we can not make a stronger statement than this because the magnetic regulation model can not currently make more specific predictions .",
    "note that it is not critical for this purpose that the objects in question truly be in exact virial equilibrium , since they almost certainly are not .",
    "we are using the virial parameter only as a way of parameterizing the strength of the turbulence relative to the strength of gravity , so all that we require is that the objects have virial parameters @xmath182 , i.e. that they not be either completely collapsing or completely non - self - gravitating .      a fourth idea to explain",
    "the low star formation rate is that turbulence inhibits collapse .",
    "this idea has a long history , and we refer readers to @xcite for a thorough review .",
    "recently , @xcite synthesized simulations and analysis of turbulence - inhibited star formation by @xcite and @xcite to derive an estimate that turbulence produces a star formation rate @xmath183 , where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the virial parameter and mach number of a star - forming gas cloud .",
    "the estimate is based on a derivation of the fraction of mass that is unstable to collapse in a medium that has the density and velocity structure common to supersonic isothermal turbulence , and is calibrated against simulations .",

    "simulations of star formation in turbulent gas for which the turbulent energy is roughly equal to the gravitational potential energy , either because it is driven artificially or because the simulations include feedback from protostellar outflows , also give values of @xmath1 that are broadly consistent with the data .",
    "we show three examples in figure [ sfrffn ] : @xcite simulate a periodic box in which the kinetic and turbulent energies are approximately equal and the turbulence is driven to keep the level of turbulence roughly constant .",
    "they find a star formation rate of @xmath189 at a resolution of @xmath190 cells .",

    "@xcite find @xmath192 in a simulation with a central density of @xmath193 @xmath7 that includes protostellar outflows from forming stars , which keep the kinetic and gravitational potential energies approximately equal .",

    "* ) emphasize the length scale of the driving as critical to determining whether the turbulence can keep @xmath1 low , and @xcite show that the characteristic distinguishing driving that gives @xmath12 from driving that produces @xmath156 is how the jeans length in the gas compares to the sonic length of the turbulence , defined as the length scale for which the turbulent velocity dispersion equals the sound speed .",
    "other diagnostics , such as the imf and clustering statistics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite show that the condition distinguishing cases with @xmath12 from those with @xmath194 reduces to the statement that clouds with @xmath195 have low values of @xmath1 , while those with @xmath196 have @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the combination of observations of @xmath1 and those showing that most turbulent energy is on large scales imply that turbulence can only reproduce the observed values of @xmath1 if it is driven strongly enough to produce @xmath182 .      another important implication of this work is for the formation timescale of star clusters . the star formation efficiency of clusters , defined as the fraction of the initial gas mass that forms stars over the lifetime of the gas clump , is thought to be @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "since the observational data show that @xmath1 is at most a few percent , this implies that the cluster formation process must take at least @xmath198 ( @xmath199 crossing times ) .",
    "the recent observation by @xcite that individual hcn clumps in the galaxy with ir luminosities @xmath200 @xmath87 lie on the same @xmath201 correlation as entire galaxies also provides indirect evidence that the cluster formation time scale is comparatively long .",
    "wu et al . suggest that luminous hcn clumps fall on the galactic ir - hcn correlation because they contain enough stars to sample the imf fully .",
    "our results showing a large scatter in the light output for small clusters support this conjecture .",
    "however , our results on the age - dependence of the luminosity suggest that a mass large enough to sample the imf is not sufficient by itself to place a cluster on the extragalactic ir - hcn correlation .",
    "since star formation in the galaxies surveyed by @xcite has been ongoing for @xmath202 myr , their ir luminosities trace the star formation rate , and the @xmath201 correlation is therefore a statement of the star formation rate per unit mass in hcn gas . if the galactic hcn clumps observed by @xcite typically survived for only @xmath14 free - fall time , @xmath203 myr , then as figure [ lt ] shows their luminosity per unit star formation rate would be quite different than that of an older galactic population , and they would not lie on the galactic correlation .",
    "one would only expect galactic hcn clumps to follow the extragalactic @xmath204 correlation if they are massive enough to sample the imf well _ and _ if they are @xmath205 myr old , which means that they must have existed for at least @xmath206 , and probably closer to @xmath207 .",
    "these two lines of evidence provide additional support for the argument that star clusters form in near - equilibrium gas clumps presented by @xcite .",
    "tan et al .",
    "discuss the implications of this finding in more detail , but we note here two of the most significant .",
    "first , formation times of @xmath208 or longer appear inconsistent with models in which turbulence in protocluster gas is freely decaying .",
    "simulations show that if turbulence is allowed to decay freely ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or never contained energy comparable to the gravitational potential energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the star formation process generally ends in only about @xmath209 , with @xmath210 of the mass in stars . only if the turbulence is continually driven can there be enough gas left up to @xmath207 for the star formation process to continue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the long cluster formation time scales suggested by the observations therefore imply that either the simulations of decaying turbulence are incorrect or ( more likely ) the turbulence is continually driven .",
    "this is consistent with on observations by @xcite and @xcite , and with simulations of protostellar feedback by @xcite .",
    "we note again that the observations of @xmath1 alone put no constraints on how or at what scale the turbulence is driven",
    ". it can be from internal sources of feedback on small scales , or from a turbulence cascade in which most of the power is on the size scale of an entire gmc .",
    "a second implication is for the mechanism responsible for the stellar initial mass function . @xcite",
    "have recently emphasized that the competitive accretion mechanism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) can only operate in the context of a strongly sub - virial gas clump that is undergoing global collapse and converting order unity of its gas mass into stars in a free - fall time .",
    "@xcite concur that the question of whether competitive accretion occurs or not depends on the extent to which gas and stellar velocities in a forming star cluster remain tightly coupled for the majority of the formation process , which in turn depends on whether feedback is effective at driving turbulence , which would change gas velocities but not stellar velocities .",
    "if turbulent driving keeps clusters virialized for many free - fall times and limits @xmath1 to @xmath211 , then competitive accretion can not occur within those clusters .",
    "the observations we discuss here provide evidence for low values of @xmath1 and long cluster formation times , and therefore provide strong evidence against the possiblity that competitive accretion determines the imf .",
    "we present observational evidence for two surprising conclusions , one shown quite strongly and the other more tentatively .",
    "first , and very clearly , _ star formation in dense gas is slow . _ the time required to convert all the gas into stars , the depletion time , is longer than the free - fall time by at least and order of magnitude , and probably closer to two orders of magnitude .",
    "there is no evidence that gas at densities up to @xmath212 @xmath7 resides primarily in objects that are undergoing collapse and rapid star formation .",
    "second , and more tentatively , _",
    "the ratio of free - fall time to the depletion time is independent of the characteristic density of the star - forming object in question_. the data at present are uncertain , and are insensitive to changes of less than roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "nonetheless , it is interesting that this ratio varies by no more than an order of magnitude from the typical density of gmcs to the typical density of hcn(1 - 0)-emitting gas , a range of nearly 3 decades in density .",
    "these observations are a strong constraint for theories of star formation , and seem difficult to explain in the context of models in which there is a transition from slow , unbound star formation to rapid , bound star formation somewhere between the gmc scale and the protocluster scale .",
    "slow star formation in cluster - forming gas also implies that clusters require many free - fall times to assemble , as recently argued by @xcite on other grounds .",
    "models in which star formation takes place in virialized objects and is inhibited by strong magnetic fields are qualitatively consistent with the data , and models in which star formation is inhibited by turbulence are both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with observations .    in the future",
    "it would be extremely useful to improve the data on which figure [ sfrffn ] is based .",
    "one way to do this would be to perform detailed studies of other young clusters and obtain data comparable to that for the onc .",
    "this would provide a method of estimating @xmath1 that is independent of luminosity conversions and does not suffer from concerns about the completeness of galactic surveys .",
    "another improvement in the data could come from an unbiased survey of cs(5 - 4 ) emission in the milky way or in another galaxy , which would allow us to replace the upper limit on @xmath1 we derive here with an actual estimate .",
    "this would be particularly valuable because the upper limit on @xmath1 from cs(5 - 4 ) is well above the estimate from hcn(1 - 0 ) , even though the densities are not very different .",
    "unbiased cs observations could likely bring down this point .",
    "another improvement would be extend the data to higher densities . to accomplish",
    "this will require observations either of external galaxies or relatively complete surveys of the milky way in molecular transitions that trace densities @xmath213 @xmath7 .",
    "determining masses from the luminosities in these transitions will probably require high resolution follow - up observations of galactic sources in optically thin isotopomers so that the luminosity may be correlated against a virial mass . while this is a significant observational challenge ,",
    "such surveys might make it possible to identify a scale at which star formation transitions from slow to fast , a crucial datum in understanding the star formation process .",
