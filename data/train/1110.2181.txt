    "the matrix elements of local operators ( form factors ) are central objects in quantum field theory .",
    "indeed they are the subject of considerable interest in lattice qcd , where  among other applications  they are relevant in describing the weak decays of hadrons . due to the maiani - testa",
    "no - go theorem @xcite , it is necessary to extract them using finite - size methods , which are the subject of a seminal paper by lellouch and lscher @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a closely related problem is description of resonances , whose decay width can also be extracted from finite - size data , for which the first proposal was made by lscher @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional integrable quantum field theories provide an ideal testing ground for these ideas because in many such models the exact analytic expressions of the form factors are known .",
    "first , the @xmath1 matrix can be obtained exactly in the framework of factorized scattering developed in @xcite ( for a later review see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that it is possible to obtain a set of equations satisfied by the form factors using the exactly known scattering amplitudes as input .",
    "the complete system of form factor equations , which provides the basis for a programmatic approach ( the so - called form factor bootstrap ) was proposed in @xcite . for a detailed and thorough exposition of the subject",
    "we refer to @xcite .    on the other hand , for two - dimensional theories",
    "there is a very efficient alternative to lattice field theory to evaluate finite size spectra and matrix elements called the truncated conformal space approach , which was first proposed by yurov and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "recently we used this framework to perform a detailed analysis of resonances and local operator matrix elements .",
    "resonances were studied in @xcite , where it was argued that they can be extracted with a much better accuracy from level splittings than from the slope method originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was realized that the proposed method ( dubbed the `` improved mini - hamiltonian '' method ) is essentially equivalent to determining the matrix element of the interaction term responsible for the decay , and in @xcite we explored an approach to treat general matrix elements of local operators , which is an extension of the lellouch - lscher approach .",
    "a proof given in @xcite shows that results obtained in this framework are valid to all orders in the inverse volume @xmath2 i.e. up to corrections decaying exponentially with the volume .",
    "we also realized that these so - called `` residual '' finite size corrections could play an important role , but the tools to study a particular class of these , the so - called @xmath0-terms were only developed later by pozsgay in @xcite .    in this work the issue of @xmath0-terms is addressed in more details .",
    "the testing ground is a specific version of the well - known sine - gordon theory , the so - called @xmath3-folded model @xcite , mainly because all the necessary techniques are well - developed and the model is thoroughly understood from the theoretical point of view .",
    "this work can also be considered as a refinement of the form factor study performed in @xcite , where the relevance of @xmath0-terms was pointed out , but their detailed analysis was omitted .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present the issues in a way that leads to conclusions which are expected to be relevant to a wide class of models , and in particular to the ongoing efforts to determine resonance parameters and decay matrix elements in lattice qcd .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : the - two - folded - sine - gordon ] the necessary details concerning the two - folded sine - gordon model are introduced .",
    "section [ sec : form - factors - in ] presents the formalism of finite size form factors , first the description valid to all orders in @xmath4 and then determining the leading exponential corrections a.k.a . the @xmath0-terms .",
    "the theoretical results presented here are compared to numerical data extracted from tcsa in section [ sec : determining - matrix - elements ] .",
    "section [ sec : decay - widths - of ] discusses the relevance of these findings to the description of resonances , and in section [ sec : conclusions - and - outlook ] the conclusions are formulated .",
    "the detailed and rather bulky formulae for the exact form factors ( determined from the bootstrap ) are summarized in appendix [ sec : sine - gordon - breather - form - factors ] .",
    "the classical action of sine - gordon theory is @xmath5 a useful representation of the model at quantum level is to consider it as the conformal field theory of a free massless boson perturbed by a relevant operator . in this framework ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath6 where the semicolon denotes normal ordering in terms of the modes of the @xmath7 massless field . due to anomalous dimension of the normal ordered cosine operator , the coefficient @xmath8 has dimension @xmath9^{2-\\beta^{2}/4\\pi}\\ ] ] and it sets the mass scale of the model .",
    "the genuine coupling constant is @xmath10 which for later convenience is reparametrized as @xmath11 the spectrum consists of a doublet of solitons and their bound states , which are called breathers .",
    "the scattering amplitudes of this model are briefly reviewed in appendix [ sub : spectrum - and- ] .",
    "as usual in two - dimensional kinematics , the on - shell energy - momentum two - vector @xmath12 of a particle with mass @xmath13 is parametrized with the rapidity @xmath14 : @xmath15 lorentz boosts correspond to shifting all rapidities by the same constant .    in finite volume , it is possible to choose quasi - periodic boundary conditions for the field leading to a set of possible local theories labeled by an integer @xmath3 called the folding number @xcite . to define the @xmath3 -folded theory @xmath16",
    "we take the sine - gordon field @xmath17 as an angular variable with the period @xmath18 when the space is a finite circle with circumference ( in this case also the volume ) @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 , this implies the following quasi - periodic boundary condition for the field @xmath21 the classical ground states are easily obtained : @xmath22 which shows that the condition ( [ period ] ) corresponds to identifying the minima of the cosine potential with a period @xmath3 . in the infinite volume ( @xmath23 ) quantum theory these correspond to vacuum states @xmath24 which have the property @xmath25 these states are all degenerate in the classical theory and also at quantum level when @xmath23 ; however , tunneling lifts the degeneracy in finite volume @xmath26 .",
    "the spectrum of breather multi - particle states is obtained in @xmath3 copies corresponding to the @xmath3 vacua , and in finite volume tunneling splits the degeneracy between these states by an amount of order @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the soliton mass . in the @xmath3-folded model ,",
    "the local operators of most interest are the exponential fields @xmath29 in the sequel the value of @xmath3 is set to @xmath30 so the model considered is the @xmath30-folded sine - gordon theory @xmath31 .",
    "in this work we restrict our attention to states containing only breathers ( i.e. no solitons ) .",
    "as breathers are singlets and therefore scatter diagonally , the formulae derived by pozsgay and takcs in @xcite are directly applicable .",
    "the first ingredient is to describe the multi - breather energy levels corresponding to the states @xmath32 whose finite volume counter part we are going to label @xmath33 where the @xmath34 are the momentum quantum numbers . in a finite volume @xmath19 ,",
    "momentum quantization is governed ( up to corrections decreasing exponentially with @xmath19 ) by the bethe - yang equations : @xmath35 where the phase - shift is defined as @xmath36 these equations are nothing else than an appropriate extension of the description of two - particle scattering states in finite volume @xcite . in general quantum field theories this description is only valid under the inelastic threshold , but due to integrability it can be extended to all multi - particle states regardless of their energy .    in practical calculations , because breathers of the same species satisfy an effective exclusion rule due to @xmath37 it is best to redefine phase - shifts corresponding to them by extracting a minus sign : @xmath38 so that @xmath39 can be taken for all @xmath40 and all the phase - shifts can be defined as continuous functions over the whole real @xmath14 axis .",
    "this entails shifting appropriate quantum numbers @xmath34 to half - integer values .",
    "given a solution @xmath41 to the quantization relations ( [ eq : breatherby ] ) the energy and the momentum of the state can be written as @xmath42 ( using that  with our choice of the phase - shift functions  unitarity entails @xmath43 ) .",
    "the rapidity - space density of @xmath44-particle states can be calculated as @xmath45 in infinite volume the matrix elements of local operators between multi - particle states composed of breathers can be expressed in terms of the elementary form factor functions @xmath46 using crossing symmetry @xmath47 where disconnected contributions only arise when there are particles in the two states that have identical quantum numbers and momenta .    in terms of the elementary form factors ( [ eq : elementaryff ] ) , the finite volume matrix elements of local operators between multi - particle states can be written as @xcite @xmath48 which is valid provided there are no disconnected terms .",
    "this is essentially the extension of the lellouch - lscher formalism @xcite to general multi - particle states .",
    "the finite volume quantization relations in ( [ eq : breatherby ] ) and the expression of density factors @xmath49 in ( [ eq : byjacobian ] ) are specific to the setting of two - dimensional integrable field theories , but the relation ( [ eq : genffrelation ] ) which states that finite volume matrix elements differ from their infinite volume counterparts by normalization factors given by the square roots of densities of states is generally valid in any quantum field theory ( with a nonzero mass gap ) , as can be seen by considering the way this expression was derived in @xcite .    note the absolute values in ( [ eq : genffrelation ] ) that are necessary to take into account that the finite volume and infinite volume phase conventions differ . in our framework",
    "it is known how to compensate for the difference .",
    "the finite volume eigenvectors obtained from tcsa can be chosen real , as the hamiltonian is a real symmetric matrix , and then all matrix elements of exponential operators turn out to be real .",
    "on the other hand , apart from the @xmath50 factors in ( [ eq : b1ffs ] ) the only complex function is the minimal two - particle form factor @xmath51 , whose phase at a real value of the argument is equal to the square root of the @xmath1-matrix .",
    "therefore the above relation can be rewritten as @xmath52 where the only remaining ambiguity is a sign corresponding to the choice of the branch of the square root ( note that this ambiguity is also manifest in the tcsa eigenvectors since demanding their reality does not fix their sign ) .",
    "note also that the values @xmath53 are real whenever @xmath14 is real .",
    "disconnected terms may appear when there are two breathers of the same species in the two states whose rapidities exactly coincide .",
    "this can happen in two cases : when the two states are identical , or when there is a particle with exactly zero momentum in both of them @xcite .",
    "here we only quote the latter since that is needed for our computations . defining the function @xmath54 one can write @xmath55 where the compensating phase factor is entirely analogous to the one in ( [ eq : genffrelationphasecorr ] ) .",
    "the above predictions for finite volume energy levels and matrix elements are expected to be exact to all ( finite ) orders in @xmath4 @xcite ( note that the exponential corrections are non - analytic in this variable ) .        using the ideas in @xcite",
    ", we can model a finite volume @xmath56 state as a pair of @xmath57 particles with complex conjugate rapidities @xmath58 where @xmath59 can be obtained by solving the @xmath60 bethe - yang equations ( written here in exponential form ) : @xmath61 where @xmath62 the solution for @xmath59 has the large volume behavior @xmath63 with @xmath64 therefore , for @xmath65 one obtains the usual bootstrap identification @xmath66 and the momentum and energy of the state tends to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass of * @xmath56 * in terms of that of @xmath57 , consistent with ( [ eq : breather_mass ] ) . for a stationary @xmath56 , the energy dependence on the volume is @xmath69 where the second expression shows the asymptotic behavior valid for large enough @xmath19 .",
    "one can also write @xmath70 where the @xmath71 fusion angle is @xmath72    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the first question to address is : how could the @xmath0-terms be so large in the case of one - particle  one - particle and two - particle  one - particle matrix elements ?",
    "they decay exponentially by the volume , and therefore are expected to decrease very quickly . as a rule of thumb volumes larger than five times the correlation length of the theory are expected to be large enough to safely neglect them when calculating to an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "this is borne out by the finite volume mass corrections examined in subsection [ sub : finite - volume - mass ] .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath0-term predictions for the mass corrections read @xmath73 with @xmath74 note that these enter as arguments of cosine functions , which are very smooth and have derivatives of order @xmath75 . as a result , their contributions are relatively small for @xmath76 , with the asymptotic forms @xmath77 what about matrix elements then ?",
    "the great difference in the @xmath0-term corrected finite - volume matrix elements ( [ eq : vacb2ffmu],[eq : b1b2ffmu ] ) , ( [ eq : b3ffmu ] ) and ( [ eq : b1b3ffimprmu ] ) is that the parameter @xmath59 also appears in them as kinematical argument of form factors .",
    "when the parameters @xmath59 are expanded around their asymptotic value , the correction takes the form of the @xmath0-term exponential multiplied by the derivative of the form factor .",
    "form factors , however , can be rapidly varying functions of their arguments . indeed , they have singularities corresponding to bound states and even in the absence of these they always have disconnected contributions .",
    "these disconnected contributions can appear whenever there are particle rapidities displaced by @xmath78 , which according to the crossing relation ( [ eq : crossing ] ) corresponds to a matrix elements with one or more particles with identical quantum numbers ( including momenta ) in the two states between which the matrix elements of the local operator are taken .",
    "the data are indeed consistent with this interpretation . as shown on the example of vacuum",
    "one - particle matrix elements , @xmath0-term contributions are similar in magnitude to the mass corrections .",
    "there are countless other data generated in previous studies ( and also for testing during this work ) for matrix elements between vacuum and multi - particle states , and the results are always similar : @xmath0-terms appear , but their magnitude is consistent with what is expected from the energy levels .",
    "they can only contribute much when their scale @xmath0 is very small , i.e. for volumes @xmath79 ( which can still be a headache in some cases , and this provided the motivation for the investigation in @xcite ) .",
    "however , for matrix elements with multi - particle states on both sides one runs a good chance of running into problems with the rapid variation of the form factor appearing in the @xmath0-term formulae .",
    "sometimes it is even possible to hit a disconnected piece head - on , as happened for the stationary @xmath57-@xmath80 matrix element for which the theoretical prediction ( [ eq : b1b3ffimprmu ] ) did include an additional term which introduced an additional factor of @xmath19 into the volume dependence .      when matrix elements are to be determined numerically , whether in lattice qcd or in the tcsa approach , it is necessary to model the volume dependence of the matrix elements in order to extract the infinite volume result one is interested in .",
    "the usual way to model it accounts for the difference in the normalization between the infinite volume and finite volume matrix elements , taken into account by the state density factors in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : genffrelation ] ) .",
    "it is important to include the corrections by the scattering between the particles in finite volume ( taken into account by the bethe - yang equations ( [ eq : breatherby ] ) ) , because these are of order of some inverse power of @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , this is what lellouch and lscher do in their work @xcite .",
    "exponential finite size corrections , on the other hand , correspond to radiative corrections specific to finite volume where the loop winds around because of the periodic boundary conditions , and are often neglected .    in some cases ( notably those involving only stationary particles ) the properly normalized matrix elements are predicted to be constant up to exponential finite size corrections .",
    "so the presence of such corrections can be observed by the fact that the matrix element is not a constant , as in subsections [ fig : vaconepart ] and [ fig : onepartonepart ] .",
    "therefore one could at least have the idea whether there are sizable exponential corrections , and with a bit of luck one may even try to fit it and extrapolate to infinite volume .",
    "however , in cases involving moving particles as in subsection [ sub : two - particle  one - particle - matri ] , this does not work : there is no way of telling the qualitative difference between the volume dependence of the dashed and continuous lines in fig .",
    "[ sub : two - particle  one - particle - matri ] without having a theoretical understanding of the @xmath0-terms .",
    "if one tries to determine the infinite volume form factor without accounting for the @xmath0-term , one can easily commit a ( systematic ) error of the order of 20 - 50% ( for most of the parameter space in the examples of two - particle  one - particle form factors considered here ) , and sometimes even errors of the order of 100% ( for the @xmath81 case ) !",
    "therefore the question is whether it is possible to have a theoretical understanding of @xmath0-terms . in the case of integrable models",
    "the job is made easier by the existence of exact solutions to the form factor bootstrap , in terms of which one can express the @xmath0-term contributions by analytically continuing the description ( [ eq : genffrelationphasecorr ] ) .",
    "note that for the case of @xmath82 matrix elements , which is of interest to resonances in the two - frequency sine - gordon model , this requires knowledge of a five - particle form factor , a quite nontrivial object .",
    "therefore this does not seem a viable option in the case of theories like qcd , where the task is to determine weak interaction matrix elements between hadron states .",
    "we remark that @xmath83-term type exponential finite size corrections are essentially perturbative when considered in terms of low energy effective field theory ; this is already clear from the derivation of finite volume mass corrections by lscher @xcite . in lattice",
    "qcd , they are handled by using chiral perturbation theory to construct the loop integrals , which are then put into finite volume using the finite volume perturbation theory formalism @xcite .",
    "the unknown matrix elements entering them are parametrized by some low - energy constants , which are to be determined by fitting to volume dependence numerically obtained on the lattice .      for resonances ,",
    "there is not even the silver lining that existed for matrix elements involving only stationary particles , where one could at least observe if the volume dependence was not quite right .",
    "the reason is that their properties can be measured by observing level splittings , which occur at particular values of the volume .",
    "even in the two - dimensional setting , finding two or more level crossings ( more properly these are level avoidances ) of the same type ( meaning the same particle content for the levels ) at substantially different values of the volume , and with the numerics accurate enough , is a tough problem @xcite .",
    "however , to see whether there are substantial exponential finite size corrections to the decay rates one needs to do exactly that : the most straightforward way out is to find level crossings at several different values of the volume , and perform an infinite volume extrapolation , or at least get an estimate for the systematic error caused by the exponential corrections .      without having a handle on the size of the exponential finite size corrections one can not tell whether the observed discrepancy e.g. between a lattice result and an experimentally measured decay width is a result of systematic error or a disagreement between theoretical model and physical reality .",
    "therefore it is important to have a good theoretical description , or at least an estimate of these corrections .",
    "one special feature of @xmath0-terms is that in contrast to all other exponential corrections which are bounded by the value of the mass gap of the theory , @xmath0-terms can decay substantially slower with the volume in the case of weakly bound states .",
    "moreover , even when they are expected to decay fast on the basis of the magnitude of their characteristic scale @xmath0 , their contributions to matrix elements can still be enhanced .",
    "measuring their contribution to energy levels is not enough to estimate the errors in matrix element and resonance width calculations .",
    "it is important to stress that the ingredients essential to the observations made in this papers are not restricted to the two - dimensional setting .",
    "the description of particles as composites in subsection [ sub : mu - terms - the - leading - exp - correction ] is just the well - known quantum mechanical treatment of bound states as analytic continuation of scattering states to complex values of the momenta .",
    "in fact , the expression of @xmath0-term corrections to finite volume masses are not that much different in higher space - time dimensions @xcite , the only difference is the appearance of some ( negative ) powers of @xmath19 ( and numerical factors ) in front of the exponential correction term . concerning form factors , the matrix elements in quantum field theories of four ( or indeed any ) space - time dimensions share the essential feature with their two - dimensional counterparts that they have singularities corresponding to disconnected pieces and bound state poles . therefore",
    "they too can be expected to show rapid variation in kinematical domains close to these singularities .",
    "in fact , the difficult aspect of modeling the @xmath0-terms in higher dimensions is to have the necessary information about many - particle form factors , which is so readily provided by the bootstrap in integrable models .",
