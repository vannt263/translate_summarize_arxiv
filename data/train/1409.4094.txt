    "we note that this hindrance can be overcome , by resorting to a large number of repeated measurement ( or a large ensemble of replica on which the same weak measurement is carried out ) .",
    "weak measurements , due to their vanishing back - action , can be exploited for quantum feedback schemes @xcite and conditional measurements .",
    "the latter is especially interesting for a two - step measurement protocol ( whose outcome is called ( wv ) @xcite ) , which consists of a weak measurement ( of the observable @xmath0 ) , followed by a strong one ( of @xmath1 ) , @xmath2\\ne0 $ ] .",

    "the particular features of wvs rely on weak measurement , and are washed out in projective measurements . understanding the relation and the crossover between these two tenets of quantum mechanics is therefore an important issue on the conceptual level .",

    "this allows to define a ( gcv ) , interpolating between wv and sv ( ) . the latter , in similitude to wv , refers to a 2-step measurement protocol .",
    "unlike wv , in a sv protocol both steps consist of a strong measurement . the mathematical expression for gcv",
    "is depicted below in equation  .",
    "it amounts to the average of the first measurement s reading ( whatever its strength is ) , conditional on the outcome of the second measurement .",
    "this has been studied in the context of single - degree - of - freedom systems @xcite , where the wv - to - sv crossover is quite straightforward and is a smooth function of the interaction strength .",
