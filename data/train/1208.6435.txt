    "quantal tunnelling effects have been widely studied in heavy - ion fusion reactions at bombarding energies at the vicinity and below the coulomb barrier @xcite . in low - energy fusion reactions , the simple one - dimensional barrier - penetration model ( 1d - bpm ) @xcite is based upon a real potential barrier resulting from the attractive nuclear and repulsive coulomb interactions . for light- and medium - mass nuclei",
    ", one only assumes that the di - nuclear system ( dns ) fuses as soon as it has reached the region inside the barrier i.e. within the potential pocket .",
    "if the system can evolve with a bombarding energy high enough to pass through the barrier and to reach this pocket with a reasonable amount of energy , the fusion process will occur after a complete amalgation of the colliding nuclei forming the compound nucleus ( cn ) . on the other hand , for sub - barrier energies",
    "the dns has not enough energy to pass through the barrier .",
    "the specific role of multi - step nucleon - transfers in sub - barrier fusion enhancement still needs to be investigated in detail both experimentally and theoretically @xcite for reactions induced by stable neutron - rich beams . in a complete description of the fusion dynamics the transfer channels in standard coupled - channel ( cc ) calculations",
    "@xcite have to be taken into account accurately .",
    "it is known , for instance , that neutron transfers may induce a neck region of nuclear matter in - between the interacting nuclei favoring the fusion process to occur . in this case",
    ", neutron pick - up processes can occur when the nuclei are close enough to interact each other significantly @xcite , if the q - values of neutron transfers are positive .",
    "it was shown that sequential neutron transfers can lead to the broad distributions characteristic of many experimental fusion cross sections .",
    "finite q - value effects can lead to neutron flow and a build up of a neck between the target and projectile @xcite .",
    "the situation of this neck formation of neutron matter between the two colliding nuclei could be considered as a  doorway state \" to fusion . in a basic view , this intermediate state induced a barrier lowering . as a consequence , it will favor the fusion process at sub - barrier energies and enhance significantly the fusion cross sections .",
    "experimental results have already shown such enhancement of the sub - barrier fusion cross sections due to the neutron - transfer channels with positive q - values @xcite .    in reactions induced by weakly bound nuclei and/or by halo nuclei ,",
    "the influence on the fusion process of coupling both to collective degrees of freedom and to transfer / breakup channels is a key point @xcite for the understanding of n - body systems in quantum dynamics @xcite .",

    "the @xmath5he and @xmath7li halo nuclei or an extended spatial distribution for the loosely bound proton in the @xmath9b or @xmath10f proton - rich nuclei would lead to larger total reaction ( and fusion ) cross sections at sub - barrier energies as compared to 1d - bpm model predictions .",
    "this enhancement is well understood in terms of the dynamical processes arising from strong couplings to collective inelastic excitations of the target ( such as `` normal '' quadrupole and octupole modes ) and projectile ( such as soft dipole resonances ) . however , in the case of reactions where at least one of the colliding nuclei has a sufficiently low binding energy for the breakup channels to become among the most competitive processes , conflicting conclusions were reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "recent studies with radioactive ion beams ( rib ) indicate that the halo nature of @xmath11he and @xmath7be nucclei @xcite , for instance , does not enhance the fusion probability as anticipated .",
    "rather the prominent role of one- and two - neutron transfers in @xmath11he induced fusion reactions was definitively demonstrated . on the other hand , the effect of non - conventional transfer / stripping processes appears to be less significant for stable weakly bound projectiles .",
    "several experiments involving @xmath12be , @xmath13li , and @xmath5li projectiles on medium - mass targets have been undertaken .    in this work , after a brief description of some selected experimental results in section 2 , we will discussed in 3.1 ) standard cc calculations with and without coupling of the multi - nucleon transfer in the fusion process induced by stable beams at sub- and near - barrier energies and in 3.2 ) continuum - discretized coupled - channel ( cdcc ) calculations taking into account the effect of the breakup of weakly bound nuclei on the elastic scattering , and consequently on the the total reaction cross section and on the fusion cross section and the magnitude of the breakup itself .",

    "<S> the breakup coupling in both the elastic scattering and in the fusion process induced by weakly bound stable projectiles is also shown to be crucial . in the second part of this work , full coupled - channel calculations of the fusion excitation functions </S>",
    "<S> are performed by using the breakup coupling for the more neutron - rich reaction and for the more weakly bound projectiles . </S>",
