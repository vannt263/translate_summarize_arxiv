    "the identification of nuclear effects in neutrino scattering is essential for modern neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite . in particular the sensitivity of the neutrino energy reconstruction to multi - nucleon events",
    "has been stressed in recent data analyses @xcite . in the minerva neutrino experiment",
    "an enhanced population of multi - proton states has been observed between the quasielastic and @xmath3 peaks .",
    "on the other hand , observation of events with a pair of energetic protons at the interaction vertex accompanying the muon in @xmath4ar@xmath0 reaction has been reported in the argoneut experiment @xcite . from these events",
    "several back - to - back nucleon configurations have been identified and associated with nuclear mechanisms involving short - range correlated ( src ) neutron - proton ( np ) pairs in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "however in @xcite these `` hammer events '' have been modeled by a simple pion production and reabsorption model without nucleon - nucleon correlations , suggesting that the distribution of pp pairs in the final state is less sensitive to details of the initial pair configuration . in the opinion of the authors of @xcite ,",
    "the events can not teach us anything significant about src .",
    "the nuwro event generator supports that the excess of back - to - back events in argoneut has a kinematic origin and is not directly related to src @xcite .",
    "src with back - to - back configurations have been also identified in two - nucleon knock - out electron scattering experiments on @xmath1c for high momentum transfer and missing momentum @xcite . in this case one",
    "expects an excess of np pairs over pp pairs @xcite .",
    "the experiment reported a number of np pairs 18 times larger than their pp counterparts .",
    "the analysis of these experiments is compatible with theoretical single - nucleon and nucleon pair momentum distributions in variational monte carlo calculations , where the importance of the tensor forces in the ground - state correlations of nuclei has been emphasized @xcite . while the kinematics of the experiments have been selected to minimize the contribution from other mechanisms that can induce two - particle emission , such as meson - exchange currents ( mec ) and isobar excitations @xcite , the contribution of mec can not be ruled out _ a priori _ @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the relative effect of mec on the separate pp and np channels in the inclusive 2p-2h neutrino cross section .",
    "it has been emphasized that the separate charge distributions of 2p-2h events are useful .",
    "one of the reasons is for their use in monte carlo event generators @xcite .",
    "for instance in nuwro configurations the mec 2p-2h excitations are assumed to occur 95% of the time for events where the interaction occurs in initial np pairs @xcite ( or final pp pairs for charged current neutrino scattering ) .",
    "this value was estimated based on the assumption , claimed also in @xcite , that neutrinos interact mostly with correlated np pairs . from a naive calculation",
    "this value agrees with a factor 18/19 , corresponding to the extracted value of np/(np+pp ) in the @xmath1c@xmath5 experiment of @xcite .",
    "however this neutrino generator uses a 2p-2h model that does not give separate pp and np contributions , and therefore this choice is not fully consistent from the theoretical point of view @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is expected that the ratio between np and pp interactions should be kinematics dependent and not only a global factor .",
    "thus a theoretical quantification of the np / pp ratio and its dependence on the typical kinematics would be desired for each implementation of 2p-2h cross sections .",
    "results for the separate pp and np contributions due to short - range correlations have been presented in @xcite , for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 response functions , and for @xmath8 mev / c , but not for the differential cross section .",
    "the contribution of initial np pairs to the t response found in @xcite is about twice that of the initial nn pairs .",
    "we have recently developed a fully relativistic model of meson - exchange currents in the 2p-2h channel for electron and neutrino scattering @xcite .",
    "this model is an extension of the relativistic mec model of @xcite to the weak sector .",
    "it has been recently validated by comparing to the @xmath1c@xmath9 inclusive cross section data for a wide kinematic range within the superscaling approach ( susa ) @xcite .",
    "this model describes jointly the quasielastic and inelastic regions using two scaling functions fitted to reproduce the data , while the 2p-2h mec contribution properly fills the dip region in between , resulting in excellent global agreement with the data .",
    "the model has been recently extended to the description of neutrino scattering reactions for a variety of experiments providing an excellent agreement with data @xcite . with this benchmark model",
    "we are able to study the separate np and pp channels in the response functions and cross section for the three @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 reactions . while this analysis was performed in @xcite for electron scattering , in this work we consider neutrino reactions .",
    "our model includes the contributions of pion - in - flight , seagull , pion - pole and @xmath3(1232 ) excitation diagrams of the mec .",
    "the two - body matrix elements between relativistic spinors were presented in our recent work @xcite , where they have been deduced from the weak pion production amplitudes of @xcite .",
    "the formalism of 2p-2h cross section including mec in the relativistic fermi gas was given in @xcite .",
    "we write the charged current ( cc ) ) cross section as @xmath12 , \\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a kinematic factor including the weak couplings defined in @xcite .",
    "note that there is a linear combination of five response functions , labeled as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath15 response function contributes differently for neutrinos ( plus sign ) than for antineutrinos ( minus sign ) .",
    "the @xmath16 factors are kinematic functions that were defined in @xcite .    the response functions @xmath17",
    "depend on the energy and momentum transfer .",
    "they are computed here in a relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model , with fermi momentum @xmath18 , where they can be expanded as the sum of one - particle one - hole ( 1p-1h ) , two - particle two - hole ( 2p-2h ) , plus additional channels .",
    "here we are interested in the 2p-2h channel , where two nucleons with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 are ejected out of the fermi sea , @xmath21 , leaving two hole states in the daughter nucleus , with momenta @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) .",

    "the main ingredient of the calculation is the set of five response functions @xmath31 , for the elementary 2p-2h transition .",
    "these elementary response functions are written in terms of the two - body mec antisymmetrized matrix elements , summed over spin .",
    "we separate the contributions of the different charge channels to the response functions .",
    "these can be @xmath32 for neutrinos , and @xmath33 for antineutrinos .",
    "in @xcite we derived general formulae for the separate np and pp response functions .",

    "in other models of neutrino scattering  @xcite , only the direct diagrams ( a , b ) of fig . [ selfenergy ] are included , while the direct - exchange contribution corresponding to the diagrams ( c , d ) are disregarded . in our model , on the contrary , both contributions are considered .",
    "the elementary 2p-2h transverse response function is given for pp emission by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the effective two - body current for pp emission with neutrinos given by @xmath44 the first term in the transverse response is the `` direct '' contribution , and the second one is the `` exchange '' contribution , actually being the interference between the direct and exchange matrix elements .",
    "diagrams ( a , b ) represent the direct contribution .",
    "diagrams ( c , d ) are the exchange contributions . ]",
    "the elementary transverse response for np emission has a similar expression @xmath45 but with the effective current @xmath46 for np emission @xmath47 which is in general different from the pp one because of the distinct isospin matrix elements .",

    "our mec model and its parameters were obtained from the pion production amplitudes of @xcite .",
    "this is an extension of the electromagnetic mec model of @xcite to the weak sector .",
    "the five mec - induced 2p-2h responses for cc neutrino interactions at fixed momentum transfer are shown in fig .",
    "the coulomb @xmath7 and transverse @xmath6 responses are also present in electron scattering . in general the @xmath50 dependence of the 2p-2h responses",
    "shows a broad peak coming from the @xmath3 excitation .",
    "the strength of the mec peak weakens with @xmath51 due to the decrease of the electroweak form factor with @xmath52 , especially the @xmath3 form factors .",
    "note also that the most important contribution to the neutrino cross section comes form the two transverse responses @xmath6 and @xmath53 . in the figure",
    "we only show the separate pp and np 2p-2h response functions , the total responses being the sum of the two . for all the cases in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we observe that the pp response functions are much larger than the np ones by a factor 6 or less depending on the kinematics .    the pp / np ratio in the present neutrino calculation can be compared to the np / pp ratio in the @xmath9 reaction studied in @xcite , because they correspond to the same pairs in the initial state . for the transverse response",
    "that ratio for neutrino scattering is roughly a factor of two smaller than for the electron case .    for @xmath8 mev",
    "/ c our results for @xmath6 can be compared to those of the src model of @xcite .",
    "our mec response at the maximum is one order of magnitude larger than that of the src one . in our calculation",
    ", the pp pair emission transverse response induced by mec is about a factor of 6 larger than the np one .",
    "in contrast , the mentioned src model shows at most a factor of 3 between the two contributions .",
    "the order of magnitude of the @xmath7 , on the other hand , is small in both mec and src 2p-2h responses , but still the mec results are about twice those of @xcite .",
    "the pp pairs in the final state continue to dominate the @xmath7 mec response , while in the src case , both pairs contribute similarly .     and @xmath15 2p-2h response functions of @xmath1c , for @xmath54 mev / c , compared to the direct contributions obtained by neglecting the direct - exchange interferences . ]",
    "although the behaviors of mec and src 2p-2h responses are completely different , one should emphasize that the cross section is dominated by the transverse responses .",
    "one could conclude from this comparison that the mec are the largest contribution to the 2n knockout strength , and that the influence of src is around 10% .    in a previous work @xcite we showed that the interference diagrams ( c , d ) of fig .",
    "1 can amount to @xmath55 of the total 2p-2h responses .",
    "but for the separate charge channels the interference influence can be truly different , as we show in fig .",
    "while the interference for pp emission produces a reduction of 20% , for np emission the reduction factor is about 1/2 .",
    "thus the ratio pp / np critically depends on the treatment on the interference contributions .",
    "the same conclusion was found for the electron scattering responses in @xcite .",
    "the effect from the interference contribution is of the same size for the @xmath15 response , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",

    "the @xmath58 response is more than twice the @xmath15 both for np and for pp channels .",
