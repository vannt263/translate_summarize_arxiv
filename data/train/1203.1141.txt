    "the long duration is considered to come from the deep ignition in the carbon layer .",
    "the fuel is mixture of carbon , hydrogen and helium @xcite .",
    "it is a rare phenomenon since the recurrent time is longer than tens of years .",
    "the superbursts from six sources are summarized by @xcite .",

    "the curve of the soft color in figure [ fig : hi ] shows a decrease of the flux by an order of magnitude along the same blackbody radius for the superburst part ( triangles ) . on the other hand , there is clockwise motion in the diagram for the outburst part ( circles ) .",
    "the flux stays almost constant from the interval 2 to 4 , while the hardness changes from 0.7 to 1.4 .",
    "these distinctions suggest different emission mechanisms between the two parts .",
    "in fact @xcite reported that the spectrum of the latter part is represented by a model consisting of diskbb of @xmath28 = 2.55 kev powerlaw of photon index = 2.25 , gaussian iron line ( 6.5 kev ) , and absorption ( column density @xmath29 @xmath7 , fixed ) , suggesting the emission of the outburst comes from the accretion disk rather than neutron star surface .",
    "how did the superburst trigger the outburst ? discussed a possibility that a normal x - ray burst induced the instability of the accretion disk and triggered outburst of cen x-4 . in the case of cen x-4 , they mentioned the duration of the irradiation of 10 minutes is not sufficient to modify the thermal structure of the disk .",
    "using the disk viscosity parameter @xmath30 , the characteristic thermal time scale @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the keplarian angular velocity gravitational constant and the mass of the neutron star .",
    "it is @xmath5 4 min when the radius @xmath36 cm , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are assumed .    in the case of the superburst ,",
    "the duration is several hours and it is much longer than the thermal time scale , even at the outer boundary of the disk .",
    "therefore the disk - instability scenario is a possible model to explain the outburst .",
    "another explanation of the outburst is mass accretion of the matter evaporated from surface of the companion star by the superburst .",
    "we define @xmath39 and @xmath40 as the distance from the inner lagrangian point @xmath41 to the neutron star and to the companion star , respectively . as typical to the low - mass x - ray binaries",
    ", the companion low - mass star is assumed to fill the roche lobe .",
    "therefore , the radius of the companion star is @xmath42 .",
    "the total radiation energy of the superburst @xmath43 heats up the companion star , whose solid angle from the neutron star is @xmath44 , with the efficiency @xmath45 , which is defined as the efficiency of the irradiated energy to the kinetic energy of the escaping matter .",
    "then , the matter on the surface with mass @xmath46 obtains the kinetic energy and escapes from the surface with the velocity @xmath47 .",
    "the energy conservation gives @xmath48 the solid angle @xmath44 is written as @xmath49 the mass of the companion star is assumed to be those of the typical x - ray bursters , @xmath50 @xcite . since the mass - to - radius ratio is almost constant among main sequence stars , the radius of the companion star with the mass in this range becomes @xmath51 .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath52 is calculated to be @xmath53 , assuming the mass of the neutron star @xmath35 of 1.4 @xmath54 .",
    "thus @xmath44 is constrained to be @xmath55    supposing that the escaped matter from the companion star surface accretes onto the neutron star , the velocity of the evaporated matter should be faster than the escape velocity of the companion star to the lagrangian point @xmath41 , but should not exceed that of the binary system .",
    "the escape velocity of the companion star to infinity is written as @xmath56 .",
    "let us express the escape velocity to @xmath41 with a parameter @xmath57 , as @xmath58 . under the assumption of the constant mass - to - radius ratio , it is written as @xmath59 .",
    "the escape velocity is expressed as @xmath60 cm s@xmath2 . when the companion star completely fills the roche lobe , @xmath61 . when the escape velocity is equal to the thermal velocity of 3000  k atmosphere , which is typical of a low - mass star , @xmath62 .",
    "the escape velocity out of the system is estimated as @xmath63 cm s@xmath2 with the mass of @xmath64 and typical size of the low - mass x - ray binary @xmath65 cm .",
    "therefore , the velocity of the evaporated matter must be @xmath66    the total accreted mass in the outburst @xmath46 can be calculated from the fluence of the outburst ( 4.3 @xmath10 erg ) and the energy release of accreting matter per unit mass , @xmath67 erg g@xmath2 , where @xmath68 is the radius of the neutron star .",
    "they lead to @xmath69 g. the mass column density of the evaporated gas on the companion hemisphere surface becomes @xmath70 g @xmath7 for @xmath71 . substituting the accreted mass @xmath46 and @xmath72 erg into equations ( [ eq : escape ] ) and ( [ eq : vcond ] ) ,",
    "the condition to @xmath73 is obtained as @xmath74 .",
    "considering equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) , the constraint on @xmath45 is obtained as @xmath75 .",
    "the course of surface - matter evaporation by x - ray irradiation contains many elementary processes such as compton scattering by electrons ( hydrogen plasma ) , photo - electric absorption by the metal elements , thermal conduction from electrons to protons , and escape probability of the proton from the reaction point to outer space through atmosphere whose density varies exponentially with height .",
    "precise theoretical calculation would be necessary to evaluate @xmath45 , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the evaporation model contains a feedback problem .",
    "if the superburst x - ray induced the succeeding outburst , the succeeding outburst itself would also induce another outburst since the flux of the initial superburst and the secondary outburst is comparable . then the outburst is supposed to repeat forever by this positive feedback .",
    "the fact is that the secondary outburst occurred only once and stopped .",
    "the energy spectrum is similar in the superburst and the outburst and would not cause a difference .",
    "both have the temperature of @xmath76 kev .",
    "in fact , the initial spike of the superburst was hard and had the only positively - detected data point in the 10 - 20 kev band as shown in figure [ fig : lc - burst ] .",
    "however , this spike contains only a small fraction of the fluence of the superburst .    a possible reason might be formation of the accretion disk .",
    "if there was no , or only a small , accretion disk when the superburst occurred , the superburst could irradiate the whole companion surface .",
    "however , once the accretion disk is formed by the mass transfer , a significant portion of the x - ray emission towards the companion star is shadowed by the disk .",
    "it reduces the evaporation of the companion surface and prevents the feedback .",
    "another possible reason might be the duration of superburst heating .",
    "the superburst lasted for 0.3 day while the accretion lasted for 5 days .",
    "the flux of the outburst was only 0.2 times of that of the superburst .",
    "there might be a threshold to induce effective mass evaporation and accretion between @xmath77 erg s@xmath2 and @xmath78 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the efficiency @xmath45 may depend on the flux .",
    "if the system of exo 1745 - 248 is typical for lmxbs , the interpretation above leads to the idea that a bright enough ( @xmath79 erg s@xmath2 or more if the shadow is considered ) outburst of lmxb induces the following mass accretion by the positive feedback .",
    "the outburst does not stop immediately ( @xmath801d ) , but lasts for a long period ( @xmath81 1 week )",
    ". it may be difficult to distinguish whether the continuing outburst is due to the positive feedback by the evaporation , or just due to the increased stellar outflow activity .",
    "however , this is at least consistent with the observational facts ( e.g. review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that once the outbursts in lmxb start they last for a while ( some weeks to months ) .      from the released energy by the superburst and the persistent flux ,",
    "the recurrence time can be estimated . using the fluence of the superburst of 1.4 @xmath10 erg and hydrogen burning energy of 6 @xmath82 erg g@xmath2 ,",
    "the mass of the hydrogen fuel is 2.3 @xmath83 g. using the average flux of 16 mcrab ( 2.7 @xmath84 erg s@xmath85 1.4 @xmath86 g s@xmath2 ) for the persistent accretion , the recurrence time is calculated to be 190 days . since the energy release of the carbon burning is @xmath87 erg g@xmath2 @xcite , the recurrence time should be longer to be 1140 days in the carbon burning case .",
    "maxi / gsc detected a superburst from exo 1745 - 248 in terzan 5 .",
    "the light curve obtained by maxi shows an exponential decay with an e - folding time of 0.3 day . from the spectral analysis of each scan",
    ", we found a softening of the blackbody temperature , from 2.2 kev ( mjd 55858.56 ) to 1.2 kev ( mjd 55859.20 ) .",
    "the sphere radius of the blackbody and its luminosity are estimated to be 6.2 km and @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , respectively , at the flux peak assuming 8.7 kpc distance .",
    "the total fluence of the superburst between 55858.5 and 55859.5 is @xmath0 erg in 2 - 20 kev .",
    "those e - folding time , temperature , softening , fluence , and radius are typical of superbursts from low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "an outburst followed the superburst 28 hours after the superburst onset .",
    "the outburst lasted for 5 days and the fluence was @xmath88 erg .",
    "we showed that the timescale and the total energy of the outburst could be consistent with the assumption that the matter evaporated from surface of the companion star by the superburst accreted onto the neutron star , while there is a possibility that the instability of the accretion disk caused by the superburst is responsible for the outburst ."
