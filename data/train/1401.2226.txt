    "the formation and the evolution of the large scale structures ( lss ) in the universe through the gravitational instability is one of the important probes of the cosmological parameters @xcite . one might be able to constrain the nature of dark energy through future galaxy surveys aim at a percent precision on a broad range of scales .",
    "one can rely on the linear perturbation theory on large scales where the amplitude of the density fluctuations is small , whereas numerical simulations or phenomenological models , such as the halo model are necessitate to investigate the small scale lss which incorporate non - linear effects @xcite .",
    "the analytical investigations beyond the linear theory are suitable for the accurate theoretical predictions to the intermediate scales observations , such as the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite .",
    "there have been several analytic techniques for the quasi - linear perturbative expansion in order to solve the equations for an irrotational and pressureless fluid of cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xcite .",
    "two major methods are the standard ( or eulerian ) perturbation theory ( spt ) and the lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) . in spt ,",
    "the density and the velocity field of the fluid are the perturbed quantities which need to be small in order to satisfy the perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "the perturbed quantity is the deviation of the particle trajectory field from the homogeneous background expansion in lpt @xcite .",
    "thus , lpt does not rely on the smallness of the density and velocity fields .",
    "however , most of these approaches are based on the single stream approximation and neglect the shell - crossing effects .",
    "the solutions for higher orders of the lpt on friedmann lematre robertson walker ( flrw ) background have been investigated @xcite . for irrotational flows ,",
    "the general second order solution is found @xcite , the third order one with slaved initial conditions is obtained @xcite , and the fourth order one is also solved @xcite .",
    "these solutions are obtained for the einstein - de sitter universe and/or the open universe .",
    "however the universe is dominated by the dark energy at present epoch and thus one needs to find the higher order solutions based on the dark energy with cdm ( @xmath0cdm ) universe .",
    "the third order solutions in eulerian perturbation theory for the general dark energy model was investigated @xcite    lagrangian resummation theory ( lrt ) has been developed which investigate both non - linear biasing and redshift space distortions @xcite . from these method , one can predict bao peaks in both real and redshift spaces @xcite . even though lrt improves the theoretical prediction for the quasi - linear observable , it is not so accurate compared to the realistic value because one adopts the lpt higher order solutions based on eds universe instead of @xmath0cdm .    in the present paper , we reexamine the fastest growing mode solutions for the lpt up to the third order for the eds and open universe .",
    "even though there have been the known solutions for these models , they are given by incorrect initial conditions and thus provides the improper coefficients . from solutions for the eds model with the correct initial condition , one can obtain the exact numerical lpt solutions for flat @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "we provide the approximate analytic solutions for @xmath0cdm models up to the third order with less than 5 % errors .",
    "we are preparing the dark energy dependent the power spectrum and other statistical observables incorporating these solutions .    in section 2",
    "we briefly review lpt .",
    "the differential equations order by order for the general @xmath0cdm models are given .",
    "then , in section 3 we investigate the solution for the each order for the eds and the open universe with the correct initial conditions .",
    "we also obtain the analytic approximation solution of the displacement vector up to the third order for @xmath0cdm models .",
    "we make conclusions in section 4 .",
    "it is convenient to define the physical distance as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the expansion scale factor and @xmath3 is the comoving eulerian coordinates .",
    "the gravitational evolution of structure for a collisionless ( cold ) dust in subhorizon scales corresponding to those of the large scale structure at present is described by the newtonian equations ( mass conservation , euler , and poisson equation , respectively ) + & = & 0 , [ mass ] + + ( ) + & = & - - _ j ( _ ij ) , [ euler ] + ^2 - 4 g a^2 |_m & = & 0 , [ poisson ] where @xmath4 is the density contrast , @xmath5 is the peculiar velocity , @xmath6 is the peculiar gravitational potential , @xmath7 is the mean matter energy density , @xmath8 is the stress tensor @xcite .",
    "note that the mass conservation equation couples the zeroth moment ( @xmath9 ) to the first one ( @xmath10 ) of the distribution function , the euler equation couples the first moment ( @xmath10 ) to the second one ( @xmath8 ) , and so on .",
    "one can close the hierarchy by postulating an ansatz for the stress tensor @xmath8 , i.e. the equation of state of the cosmological fluid @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", one can assume the irrotationality condition @xmath11 in addition to the above equations ( [ mass ] ) - ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "in eulerian perturbation theory , one expands the density contrast as ( , t ) _",
    "n=1^ _ n ( ) ^(n)(t ) [ deltaeul ] , where @xmath12 is just a book - keeping device with @xmath13 . from the second order , the behavior of @xmath14 is no longer local .",
    "the density perturbation at one spot depends on the initial perturbation at other places through the peculiar velocity . instead of working on eulerian non - linear perturbation theory which studies the dynamics of density and velocity fields , it is possible to develop non - linear perturbation theory in the lagrangian scheme by following the trajectories of particles or fluid elements @xcite .",
    "this is possible because the choice of fields representing the cosmic quantities is not unique and lagrangian approach is a change of the coordinate system itself . according to the lagrangian point of view ,",
    "the path of each fluid is followed during its evolution .",
    "each fluid particle is labeled by its initial coordinate , @xmath15 and the position of the @xmath16-particle at later time @xmath17 may be described by ( , t ) = + ( , t ) , [ vecx ] where @xmath18 is the displacement vector .",
    "thus , the motion of the fluid element may be completely described by the displacement @xmath18 .",
    "a slight perturbation of the lagrangian particle paths carries a large amount of non - linear information about the corresponding eulerian evolved observable , since the lagrangian picture is intrinsically non - linear in the density field .",
    "this overcomes the difficulty of the eulerian approach by allowing the large density contrast @xmath14 . during the highly non - linear evolution",
    ", many particles coming from the different original positions will tend to arrive at the same eulerian place .",
    "since the initial mass density field is sufficiently uniform , one can assume that the eulerian mass density @xmath19 at any given time @xmath17 satisfies the continuity relation _",
    "m(,t ) d^3 x = |_m(_0 ) ( 1 + ( , t ) ) d^3 x = |_m ( ) d^3 q [ deltam ] .",
    "if one uses @xmath20 , then one obtains 1 + ( , t ) = ( , t)^-1 [ deltam2 ] , where @xmath21 is the determinant of the jacobian matrix @xmath22 of the transformation from lagrangian to eulerian space , @xmath23 .",
    "if one wants to express the euler equation and the poisson equation given by eqs .",
    "( [ euler ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) in terms of @xmath18 , then one needs to change the spatial derivatives operator @xmath24 into the differentiation with respect to the lagrangian position @xmath16 _ = ( j _ ) ^-1 _ , [ ct ] where @xmath25 and the jacobian matrix @xmath26 is given by j _",

    "@xmath32 is symmetric if and only if the displacement vector @xmath18 is an irrotational field in the lagrangian space @xcite .",
    "thus , one obtains the inverse jacobian matrix as ^-1 = ( ( 1 + s ) _ -s _ + s^c _ ) [ jm1 ] , where @xmath33 is an element of the cofactor matrix @xmath34 .",
