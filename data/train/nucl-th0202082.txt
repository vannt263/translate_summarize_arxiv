    "the general form of a @xmath314 quark - quark correlation is represented by @xmath315 calculating the characteristic polynomial for this channel is also a straightforward application of methods already introduced and it is plotted in fig .  [ figdiquark ] .",
    "the features in this channel are qualitatively identical to those of the scalar diquark .",
    "using a planar quark - gluon vertex obtained through the resummation of dressed - gluon ladders we have explicitly demonstrated that from a dressed - quark - gluon vertex , obtained via an enumerable series of terms , it is always possible to construct a vertex - consistent bethe - salpeter kernel that ensures the preservation of ward - takahashi identities in the physical channels related to strong interaction observables . while we employed a rudimentary model to make the construction transparent , the procedure is general .",
    "however , the algebraic simplicity of the analysis is peculiar to our model .",
    "for example , using a more realistic interaction the gap and vertex equations would yield a system of twelve coupled integral equations .",
    "nevertheless , we anticipate that the qualitative features highlighted herein are robust .",
    "the simple interaction we employed characterises a class of models in which the kernel of the gap equation has sufficient integrated strength to support dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",

    "the bare vertex .",
    "in particular , it does not exhibit an enhancement in the vicinity of @xmath31 , where @xmath120 is the momentum carried by the model dressed - gluon . in addition , the dressed - quark propagator obtained in this self - consistent solution is qualitatively indistinguishable from that obtained using the rainbow truncation .",
    "the vertex - consistent bethe - salpeter kernel is necessarily nonplanar , even when the vertex itself is planar , and in our simple model it is easily calculable in a closed form : for a more realistic interaction it can be obtained as the solution of a determined integral equation .",
    "the fact that our construction ensures the kernel s consistency with the vertex and hence preservation of ward - takahashi identities is manifest in the goldstone boson nature of pion , which is preserved order - by - order and in the infinite resummation .",
    "our explicit calculations focused primarily on flavour - nonsinglet pseudoscalar mesons and vector mesons .",
    "we found that a consistent , nonperturbative dressing of the vertex and kernel changes the masses of these mesons by @xmath262% cf .  the values obtained using the rainbow - ladder truncation .",
    "that is not the case in the pseudoscalar channel if the kernel is dressed inconsistently .",
    "furthermore , @xmath316% of the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass - splitting is already generated in the rainbow - ladder truncation , which emphasises that this splitting is primarily driven by dcsb .",
