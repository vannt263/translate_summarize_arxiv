    "the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) , presently the largest uhecr observatory , has reported the detection 69 events within the energy range 55142eev between january 2004 and december 2009 @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis has shown that the fraction of these events correlating with nearby agn ( @xmath8mpc ) in the vron - cetty and vron ( vcv ) catalog is ( @xmath9)% , above the isotropic expectation of 21% .",
    "most of this excess is found around the direction of centaurus a ( cen a ) within a surrounding 18@xmath10 window , in which 13 events in the energy range 5584eev are observed while only 3.2 are expected @xcite .",
    "however , both the intergalactic and the galactic magnetic field deflect the trajectories of cosmic rays , resulting in apparent correlations with objects which are not necessarily their true birth places .",
    "furthermore , measurements on the maximum air shower elongations @xmath11 and their rms ( @xmath12 ) by the pao suggest that the chemical composition of uhecrs are progressively dominated by heavier nuclei at energies above 4eev @xcite . if the cosmic rays are indeed intermediate ",
    "mass or heavy nuclei , the deviation of their arrival directions due to propagation in the intervening magnetic fields must be significant , hence the observation of anisotropies appears slightly surprising . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it may appear more favorable to accelerate heavy nuclei , as their higher charge , comparatively to protons , reduce the energetic constraints placed on the source candidates , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , it also requires the acceleration site to be abundant in intermediate ",
    "mass or heavy elements , well beyond a typical galactic composition @xcite .",
    "finally , other experiments , such as hires or the telescope array , find that the composition at @xmath5ev remains dominated by light nuclei @xcite .",
    "one way to make progress is to use the pattern of anisotropies as a function of energy .",
    "this idea was first proposed in @xcite : if a source produces an anisotropy signal at energy @xmath13 with cosmic ray nuclei of charge @xmath2 , it should also produce a similar anisotropy pattern at energies @xmath14 via the proton component that is emitted along with the nuclei , given that the trajectory of cosmic rays within a magnetic field is only rigidity  dependent .",
    "it is easy to show that the low energy anisotropy should appear stronger , possibly much stronger than the high energy anisotropy ( assuming a chemical composition similar to that inferred at the source of galactic cosmic rays ) , offering means to constrain the chemical composition of the source .",
    "this test has been applied on the pierre auger observatory dataset and no significant anisotropy has been found at energies @xmath14 , with @xmath15eev and @xmath16 @xcite .    in the present work , we push further and generalize this idea by considering the amount of secondary protons produced through photodisintegration interactions of the primary nuclei .",
    "we provide detailed analytical and numerical estimates of the ratio of significance of the anisotropy at @xmath14 vs @xmath13 , and derive the maximal distance to the source @xmath17 in order to avoid the formation of a stronger anisotropy pattern produced by the secondary protons at energy @xmath14 .",
    "this bound does not depend on the amount of protons produced by the source .",
    "we also discuss how the comparison of the anisotropy ratio constrains the metal abundance in the source , independently of the injection spectral index , and emphasize how large this metal abundance must be , if the anisotropies persist at high energies , but not at low energies .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the prospects for the detection of anisotropies at higher energies than @xmath13 , with next generation experiments , based on current reports of anisotropies at @xmath13 .",
    "the layout of this paper is arranged as follows . in   [ sec : aniso ] , we discuss how the absence of a low  energy anisotropy signal could constrain the source distance and its metal abundance . in  [ sec : disc ] , we discuss the low energy proton fraction and the possible anisotropy signal at higher energies , as well as their implication for the source . we draw some conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we assume that some anisotropy is detected within a solid angle @xmath18 in the energy range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "following up on @xcite , we quantify the significance of the anisotropy through its signal  to  noise ratio . before doing so",
    ", we define the injected spectrum of an element with nuclear charge number @xmath2 as @xmath21 with @xmath22 the power law index and @xmath23 the relative abundance of this element at a given energy .",
    "provided that the maximum energy @xmath24 and the minimum energy @xmath25 of the accelerated spectrum are proportional to @xmath2 , i.e. scale with rigidity , the total mass of the element of charge @xmath2 and mass @xmath26 scales as @xmath27 note that the above result does not depend on the magnitude of @xmath22 , and the missing prefactor does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "this implies in particular that the ratio of the relative abundance of a species at a given energy to that of hydrogen takes the form @xmath28    we then denote respectively the number of injected and propagated primary cosmic rays with nuclear charge @xmath2 in the energy range @xmath29 $ ] by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these two quantities are related through @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surviving fraction of primaries after propagation .",
    "as we do not know the precise composition of cosmic ray events constituting the anisotropy signal , in a first scenario ( a ) we regard the fragments with less than @xmath34 lost nucleons as primaries ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "this ad - hoc choice guarantees that all arriving nuclei in the energy range @xmath29 $ ] which have suffered at most @xmath34 photodisintegration interactions retain a similar rigidity , and thus follow a similar path in the intervening magnetic fields .",
    "lighter nuclei , i.e. those that have suffered more than @xmath34 interactions and arrive in @xmath29 $ ] carry higher rigidity . depending on the intervening magnetic fields , such cosmic rays may or may not contribute to the anisotropies , since the magnetic fields may form a blurred image centered on the source ( with higher rigidity cosmic rays clustering closer to the source direction ) , or impart a systematic shift in the arrival directions , in which case the higher rigidity particles might lie outside @xmath18 , e.g. @xcite . to account for this uncertainty , we will consider in the following an alternative scenario ( b ) , in which @xmath36 and as many photodisintegration interactions are allowed ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) , provided the nucleus arrives with energy @xmath38 . in this scenario ( b ) , we thus sum up over all rigidities in excess of @xmath39 .",
    "we adopt the premise that anisotropy in the arrival distribution of uhecr nuclei has been detected at high energies between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , ie . at energies of the order of the gzk energy .",
    "since protons with the same rigidity have energies between @xmath39 to @xmath42 , one may safely neglect their subsequent energy losses given that their loss lengths at these energies are of the order of @xmath43gpc , considerably larger than the source distance considered here ( @xmath44mpc ) .",

    "the primary protons also contribute to the anisotropy , with @xmath50 note that the last equality is of particular interest .",
    "it shows that @xmath51 controls the scaling of the signal - to - noise ratio of the low energy to high energy anisotropy signals .",
    "this scaling factor does not depend on the injection spectrum index , but does depend on the metal abundance at the source .",
    "it remains valid for general injection spectra , provided this spectrum is shaped by rigidity , i.e. @xmath52 , with @xmath53 an arbitrary function .",
    "the noise is given by the square root of number of events expected from the averaged all - sky spectrum of uhecrs in the same solid angle @xmath18 .",
    "the observed spectrum of the isotropic background can be approximately described by a broken power law beyond @xmath54  ev @xcite , i.e. , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58ev .",
    "@xmath59 represents the overall amplitude , which cancels out in the following calculation .",
    "the noise counts in the energy range @xmath29 $ ] then reads @xmath60 and for the low energy noise we have @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",

    "can then be expressed as @xmath69 while the s / n of the low energy anisotropy produced by protons with the same rigidity is @xmath70n_{z , \\rm        inj}(e_1;e_2)}{\\sqrt{\\eta z^{p_1 - 1}n_{\\rm iso}(e_1;e_2)}}\\ .\\ ] ] consequently , the ratio of the signal - to - noise ratios at low to high energy reads @xmath71 and if no anisotropy is recorded at low energies , one requires @xmath72 . for reference ,",
    "the pierre auger observatory data indicate that , for the cen  a excess , @xmath73 at the 95% c.l . , for @xmath16 corresponding to carbon , silicon and iron @xcite .",
    "the exact number depends on the statistics ( which of course have increased since this analysis was carried out ) , and on the elements adopted in the analysis . in the following , we use the constraint @xmath72 to impose a limit on the maximum source distance .    in terms of the ( inverse )",

    "note that this statement is not in contradiction with the statement in the @xcite , that the limit on the quantity @xmath77 used in that paper depends on the spectral index .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath77 , which is defined at a given energy , is not the `` proton to heavy fraction in the source '' or the `` relative proton abundance '' , as it is misleadingly referred to in the auger paper ( in the notation of that paper , the relative proton abundance is @xmath78 , which is equivalent to our @xmath79 ) .",
    "the minimum required metallicity of the element responsible for the observed anisotropy thus depends on the value of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which are directly determined by the source distance .",
    "a larger source distance will result in a smaller @xmath82 and a larger @xmath81 as more nuclei are photodisintegrated .",
    "there exists therefore a critical distance , beyond which the abundance of hydrogen in the source relative to metals becomes negative .",
    "this happens when @xmath83 , meaning that even if the source injects no primary protons , secondary protons produced during propagation cause a stronger anisotropy at low energies . therefore , the critical distance , which we denote by @xmath17 hereafter , is the upper limit of the distance of the source responsible for the anisotropy signal in @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is also related to the primary cosmic ray species adopted and the injection spectrum used .",
    "once these parameters are given , we can uniquely determine @xmath17 by finding the distance for which @xmath84 using the method outlined above .",
    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays interact with the cmb and ebl photons while they propagate through extragalactic space . for nuclei , energy losses due to the photodisintegration process and the bethe ",
    "heitler process ( pair production ) by cmb photons are comparable around 55eev . as energy increases , the photodisintegration process plays a more and more dominant role in the energy loss process .",
    "photodisintegration does not change the lorentz factor of the cosmic ray nucleus , but does lead to the nucleus losing one or several nucleons as well as @xmath85 particles through the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) or quasi  deuteron ( qd ) process .",
    "these secondary nuclei can be further disintegrated to protons .",
    "on average , the mass number of a nucleus evolves as @xcite @xmath86 with @xmath87 the cross - section for photodisintegration through the @xmath88th channel ( e.g. , single ",

    "so far , our treatment has remained quite general . here , we apply it to the specific case of the `` cen a excess '' reported by the pierre auger collaboration .",
    "we thus use @xmath142eev , @xmath143eev and assume for simplicity that the source injects a pure oxygen , silicon or iron composition . in fig .",
    "[ snratio ] we show both the analytical and the numerical results of the ratio of anisotropy significance at low to high energies as a function of the distance to the source that is responsible for the anisotropy . in this figure",

    "( [ sigp ] ) and ( [ constraint2 ] ) .",
    "we adopt an exponential cut  off power law spectrum , as generally expected , with a cut  off energy @xmath146 .",
    "the four panels correspond to different injection spectral indices and maximal energies .",
    "as can be seen , these results share the following common features .    at small source distances ,",
    "the anisotropy signal produced by secondary protons is less prominent than the high energy one , because only a few primary nuclei photodisintegrate on this short path length .",
    "as more and more secondary protons are produced with increasing source distance , this ratio grows and eventually exceeds unity . in the case",
    "@xmath147ev , both the analytical treatment and the numerical treatment result in a maximum source distance of @xmath148mpc , @xmath149mpc and @xmath150mpc for oxygen nuclei , silicon nuclei and iron nuclei respectively .",
    "note that for @xmath151ev , the source produces protons of energy @xmath152eev : such protons would presumably produce a strong anisotropy , though its magnitude would depend strongly on the distribution and characteristics of intervening magnetic fields .",
    "we show therefore the case with a high @xmath153 for the sake of generality in order to illustrate the dependence of the results on the maximal energy .    from lighter to heavier nuclei , the constraint on the source distance becomes weaker , since at a given energy lighter nuclei carry a comparatively larger lorentz factor , and as a consequence , their energy lies further beyond the photodisintegration interaction threshold ( see also fig .",
    "[ lossratefit ] ) .",
    "the small differences of @xmath17 for the same species among the four panels can be interpreted as follows : protons at @xmath14 all come from primary nuclei at @xmath134 , so a smaller cut  off energy or a steeper power - law slope will decrease the amount of primary nuclei at @xmath134 , leading to less secondary protons produced at @xmath14 , so that the values of maximum source distances in these cases are larger .",
    "another way to plot these results is to consider the minimum metal abundance @xmath76 that is required at the source in order to satisfy the bound @xmath154 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ metallicity ] as a function of the distance to the source .",
    "all four panels indicate that the mass ratio of nuclei to proton @xmath155 is needed .",
    "of course , as the distance increases , so does the minimum @xmath76 , in order to compensate for the greater number of secondary protons produced during propagation .",
    "the distance where @xmath156 corresponds to @xmath157 .",
    "conversely , the asymptote as @xmath158 indicate the minimum @xmath76 amount when secondary protons can be safely neglected .",
    "we emphasize the method that we have presented remains quite general and could be applied to datasets of next generation experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained in figs .  [ snratio],[metallicity ] assume tacitly that the heavy chemical composition and the anisotropy signal reported by the pao are not artifacts .",
    "it is fair to say that these two results remain disputed .",
    "the significance level of the anisotropy , for instance , is not comfortably high , and deserves to be improved with extended datasets .",
    "the measurements of the chemical composition by the high resolution fly s eye experiment ( hires ) and telescope array ( ta ) differ appreciably from that of the pao .",
    "in particular , their data of @xmath11 and rms @xmath12 show a proton dominated spectrum at all energies @xmath159ev@xcite .",
    "one should not expect to detect anisotropies at low energies if the composition were pure proton , as the low energy protons have a much smaller rigidity than the high energy ones . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis of the chemical composition depends on the details of the hadronic interaction model , such as the cross sections , multiplicities and so on .",
    "the fact that these parameters are poorly constrained at present prevents one from drawing firm conclusions . as for the apparent anisotropy , @xcite has shown that there is no significant difference between the energy distribution of the events inside and outside the @xmath160 window of cen a using a k - s test , implying events around cen a do not have any special origin ; such an analysis can not provide however a conclusive answer , given the limited event statistics presently available .",
    "additionally , two recent papers suggest that at most 56 of events around cen a can originate from it by backtracing the events trajectories in the intervening magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we should , however , be cautious with such strong conclusions given that they depend on the magnetic field model adopted , which still carries a large degree of uncertainty .      with the above caveats in mind , it is interesting to discuss where the previous results lead us .",
    "the constraints derived from fig .  [ metallicity ]",
    "are indeed quite strong . for reference",
    ", the solar composition @xcite corresponds to @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "consequently , the minimum metallicities required to match @xmath154 , notwithstanding the secondary protons , are @xmath164 for cno , @xmath165 for si and @xmath166 for iron like nuclei .",
    "the comparison to @xmath167 is less severe for oxygen , but this nucleus is also more fragile and the minimum metallicity diverges rapidly beyond some @xmath168mpc .",
    "conversely , the production of secondary protons is less severe for iron nuclei , but for such nuclei , the minimum requirements on the source metallicity are already quite extraordinary .    the observables @xmath169 and @xmath170 , as reported by the pierre auger observatory , suggest that the all - sky - averaged composition of arriving uhecrs may be oxygen  like @xcite .",
    "if the anisotropy signal observed by the pao mainly consists of oxygen  like nuclei , our calculations indicate that the source responsible for the anisotropy should lie within @xmath168mpc .",
    "there are only a limited number of known powerful radio - galaxies within this distance , such as cen a , m87 .",
    "such radio - galaxies are relatively weak , in terms of jet power and magnetic luminosity , which implies that they can not accelerate particles beyond @xmath171ev , see the discussion in @xcite . even assuming that these sources accelerate oxygen nuclei to the highest energies , the minimum metallicity required by the above arguments lies well above what is measured in the central parts of such radio - galaxies @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes even worse if one considers silicon or heavier nuclei .",
    "consequently , and as already emphasized in @xcite , the current dataset of the pierre auger observatory , in particular the clustering towards cen  a , does not provide support for acceleration of uhecrs in this object .",
    "if future datasets confirm the existence of anisotropies at high energies , and the absence of anisotropies at low energies , then the present work provides strong constraints on the nature and the source of ultra - high energy cosmic rays : either protons exist at ultra - high energies , and some of them are responsible for the observed anisotropies ( in which case no anisotropy is indeed expected at lower energies ) ; or , a close - by source with rather extraordinarily high metallicity produces these anisotropies .",
    "the only physically motivated scenario for such a source so far is acceleration at the external shock of a semi - relativistic hypernovae inside the wind of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "provided the same source population produces both uhecrs with energy @xmath38 and @xmath129 , the proton fraction at @xmath39 becomes an interesting aspect of the problem .",
    "the key point indeed is that if @xmath172 inside the sources , as suggested by the above discussion , and all sources are alike , then the chemical composition at @xmath39 must contain a significant heavy component .",
    "more specifically , the fraction of protons at low energies is given by @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the total proton number , including the contribution from secondary protons and primary protons , as integrated over all sources , and similarly for @xmath175 .",
    "here we neglect the partially disintegrated fragments .",
    "assuming every source has equal emissivity and the same injection spectrum , we have @xmath176 and @xmath177 here @xmath178 is the source density as a function of redshift @xmath96 and @xmath179 is the comoving distance to the light cone at redshift @xmath96 ; @xmath180 and @xmath181 represent the energy loss lengths @xmath182 for nuclei and protons respectively .",
    "the second equation assumes that photodisintegration takes place on short distance scales compared to @xmath183 , which is a very good approximation .",
    "the energy losses to be considered here includes all processes besides photodisintegration , such as pair production , adiabatic cooling etc . since the energy loss distance of protons with energy @xmath184 is much larger than the energy loss distance of nuclei at energy @xmath185 , @xmath186\\rightarrow 1 $ ] for most sources . on the other hand , @xmath187\\,\\approx\\,\\exp\\left\\{-d_{\\rm c}/l_{z,\\rm      loss}\\left[(1+z)e / z)\\right]\\right\\}$ ] and given that @xmath188 $ ] is the upper limit of integration , we have will be closer to unity ] @xmath189 . as an estimation here we take @xmath190 .",
    "then , the above two equations can be written as @xmath191 @xmath192 since @xmath29 $ ] is a narrow energy range , we denote the average energy in this range by @xmath193 . considering that @xmath178 usually evolves with redshift @xmath96 , we make here a further approximation that the term @xmath194 cancels the evolution in @xmath178 to some extent and the integrand is reduced to a constant .",
    "then one can find that @xmath195 in the local universe , for oxygen nuclei , @xmath46\\,\\sim\\ , [ 7,10]\\,$]eev , hence the energy loss in this energy range is comparably caused by photodisintegration on ebl photons and pair production on cmb photons , leading to an energy loss length of @xmath196gpc . for silicon and iron nuclei , @xmath46\\ ,",
    "\\sim [ 4,6]\\,$]eev and @xmath197\\,$]eev respectively , in which energy range the dominant cooling process is adiabatic cooling with an energy loss length @xmath198gpc . for protons ,",
    "however , the dominant energy loss process in the corresponding energy range is caused by pair production on cmb photons with an energy loss length @xmath199gpc . therefore typically , the energy loss length for nuclei is larger than that for protons by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "if @xmath200 , as suggested by the previous discussion , this implies in turn that the composition in @xmath46 $ ] should comprise less than @xmath201% protons , in potential conflict with the claims of a light composition close to the ankle of the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "looking at this argument the other way round , the data from the pierre auger observatory shows evidence for the uhecr mass composition becoming progressively heavier at energies @xmath202 4eev , while below this energy the same data suggests a proton - like composition .",
    "thus , we should expect @xmath203 if the heavy elements at @xmath19 are mostly silicon or iron nuclei . in this case ,",
    "[ metallicity ] indicates that one should have detected a secondary anisotropy at the ankle . for oxygen",
    ", however , @xmath39 already lies in an energy range where the composition apparently departs from proton - like , and the above argument is severely weakened .",
    "another interesting aspect is the possible anisotropy signal that one may expect at higher energies , given the reported anisotropies at @xmath204eev .",
    "the detection of such anisotropies provides a strong motivation for next generation experiments such as jem - euso @xcite , which will provide a substantially larger amount of statistics .",
    "here we start by assuming that the currently observed anisotropy mainly consists of nuclei with charge number @xmath2 and that their source also accelerates heavier nuclei with nuclear charge number @xmath205 .",
    "these heavier nuclei will produce a similar anisotropy pattern at higher energies @xmath206 ; we define @xmath207 for clarity .",
    "the ratio of significance between these two anisotropy signals then reads @xmath208 where @xmath209 . with the approximation @xmath210 , the two species of nuclei with the same rigidity share approximately the same lorentz factor .",
    "at the same lorentz factor , heavier nuclei lose energy faster than lighter nuclei , but the differences between the energy loss lengths of different species such as o , si , fe with rigidity @xmath14 are at most a factor of a few ; furthermore , the energy loss lengths are larger than the maximum source distance @xmath17 that we have obtained in section 3 .",
    "so we expect @xmath211 .",
    "also , @xmath57 , hence @xmath212 .",
    "therefore , a stronger anisotropy signal is expected at higher energies if the source is more abundant in nuclei @xmath213 than nuclei @xmath2 . in this case , however , some accompanying effects will occur and one should also check whether these effects already cause violations against current measurements or lead to self - contradiction .",
    "we consider here the following three aspects .    * secondary protons produced by nuclei @xmath213 above energy @xmath39 .",
    "since nuclei @xmath213 at @xmath214 have the same rigidity as the nuclei @xmath2 at @xmath19 , the secondary protons emitted by nuclei @xmath213 will fall well within the energy range of interest . according to eq .",
    "( [ np2nd ] ) , we can write the secondary protons above @xmath39 as @xmath215 . as such",
    ", we obtain the ratio between the number of secondary protons produced by nuclei @xmath205 and @xmath2 above @xmath39 @xmath216 as was discussed above , the energy loss length of nuclei @xmath213 is a bit larger than that of nuclei @xmath2 with the same lorentz factor , so @xmath217 . if the source is more abundant in nuclei @xmath213 than nuclei @xmath2 , i.e , @xmath218 , nuclei @xmath213 will actually produce more secondary protons than nuclei @xmath2 , above energy @xmath39 .",
    "as such , when we calculate the low energy proton anisotropy significance , we should also consider the contribution from nuclei @xmath213 and add a non  trivial term to the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ sigp ] ) .",
    "consequently , the maximum source distance derived previously would be further reduced .",
    "* the chemical composition of uhecrs at energy @xmath214 : as the uhecr background decreases rapidly with increasing energy , the composition of cosmic rays emitted by the source can strongly influence the composition measurement at higher energies , provided the source accelerates a larger fraction of nuclei @xmath213 than nuclei @xmath2 . although it is difficult to find a quantitative relation between the composition of the source and that of the all  sky averaged composition , one might naively expect that the all  sky averaged composition above a given energy @xmath13 ( denoted as @xmath219 ) to be positively related to @xmath220 , and we find @xmath221 as one can see , since @xmath222 , if stronger anisotropy signal is detected at higher energies ( @xmath223 ) , the uhecrs composition is expected to be heavier . * the surviving nuclei @xmath205 in the energy range between @xmath19 and @xmath20 . assuming that the source is more abundant in nuclei @xmath213 than nuclei @xmath2 , the source should emit a larger amount of nuclei @xmath213 in the energy range @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "so after propagation , the number of surviving nuclei in a fixed energy range is @xmath224 . with the fact that heavier nuclei lose nucleons slower than lighter nuclei at the same energy ( not the same lorentz factor )",
    ", we expect the ratio of nuclei @xmath213 and nuclei @xmath2 emitted by the source in the energy range to be @xmath225 it does not mean however that these @xmath213 nuclei would contribute to the anisotropy pattern seen in the range @xmath29 $ ] , because they have smaller rigidity than the @xmath2 nuclei .",
    "if the source does not accelerate nuclei beyond charge @xmath2 , then the anisotropy at higher energies is produced by nuclei of charge @xmath2 . to derive the corresponding ratio of significances ,",
    "make the substitution @xmath226 , @xmath227 in eq .",
    "then , with @xmath228 , one expects the ratio to increase slightly up to the energy at which the distance to the source matches the energy loss distances , then to drop sharply beyond this distance .",
    "the detection of such a feature would provide useful constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath229 .",
    "in this work , we have generalized a test of the chemical composition of uhecrs , which proposes to use the anisotropy pattern measured as a function of energy .",
    "the basic principle is that if anisotropies are observed at high energies @xmath230ev , and if one assumes that these anisotropies are caused by heavy nuclei of charge @xmath2 , then one should observe a strong anisotropy signal at energies @xmath14 close to the ankle , due to the proton component @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we have accounted for the production of secondary protons through the photodisintegration interactions of nuclei . assuming that no anisotropy signal is detected at low energies",
    ", we derive an upper bound on the distance to the source .",
    "our numerical estimates are based on the report of the pierre auger observatory of an excess in the direction to cen  a. at present , the significance of this detection is not well established and one must await future data to confirm or invalidate it . nevertheless , the method presented here remains general and might well be applied to future more extended datasets . taking the results of the pierre auger observatory at face value",
    ", we derive a maximal distance to the source of order @xmath168mpc , @xmath231mpc , @xmath232mpc if the nuclei responsible for the anisotropies are oxygen , silicon or iron respectively . the differences between these estimates of the maximal distance are directly related to the energy loss lengths of these nuclei at gzk energies .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ metallicity ] , which shows the minimum mass of metals relatively to hydrogen required in the source , in order to produce a weaker anisotropy at @xmath14 than at @xmath13 . at distances exceeding the above estimates ,",
    "this amount diverges , meaning that even if the source does not accelerate any protons , the amount of secondary protons produced during propagation is sufficient to cause a secondary anisotropy at @xmath14 larger than that observed at @xmath13 . at small source distances , where photodisintegration effects are negligible , one nevertheless finds a minimum mass @xmath233 .",
    "when measured relatively to the solar composition , this indicates that the metallicity inside the source should exceed @xmath234 , @xmath235 , or @xmath236 if oxygen , silicon or iron nuclei are responsible for the high energy anisotropy .",
    "this result does not depend on the spectral index , or on the details of the injection spectrum , as long as the latter is shaped by rigidity . when combined , these bounds on the distance and metallicity bring in quite stringent constraints on the source of these particles .",
    "additionally , these constraints imply that if the heavy nuclei at gzk energies are silicon or iron , the proton fraction in the all - sky composition at ankle energies should be less than @xmath237% , in potential conflict with measured data .",
