    "diboson production at the tevatron can proceed directly from quark - antiquark annihilation or from the boson self - interactions or triple gauge couplings ( tgcs ) that are a consequence of the non - abelian structure of the electroweak symmetry group @xmath7 .",
    "measuring diboson production provides an important test of standard model ( sm ) predictions for these mechanisms .",
    "in particular , observing tgcs not permitted in the sm , or anomalous tgcs , would be a clear sign of new physics .",
    "understanding diboson production is also critical for higgs searches where dibosons are a major source of background in several important channels .",
    "these proceedings summarize the most recent cross section measurements by the cdf and dcollaborations for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4 production , as well as limits on the corresponding tgcs .",
    "this includes a new 5.7@xmath8 observation of @xmath4 production by dand the world s best limits on anomalous @xmath5 and @xmath6 production by cdf .",
    "the simultaneous production of two @xmath10 bosons at the tevatron is extremely rare with a predicted sm next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cross section of only @xmath11 pb  @xcite .",
    "dreported the first tevatron observation of @xmath0 production in events where each @xmath10 boson decays into an electron or a muon and a neutrino  @xcite . after selecting events with two leptons that have high transverse momenta ( @xmath12 ) and significant missing transverse energy ( @xmath13 ) from the neutrino ,",
    "25 candidate events are found in approximately 250 pb@xmath14 of data .",
    "8.1 @xmath15 1.0 of these events are expected to be background .",
    "the measured cross section is @xmath16 pb , which is consistent with the sm prediction .",
    "a similar measurement by cdf using approximately 825 pb@xmath14 of data finds 95 candidate events , @xmath17 of which are expected to be background  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cross section measurement is @xmath18 pb , which is again consistent with the sm prediction .",
    "@xmath1 production at the tevatron is even more rare with a sm nlo production cross section of @xmath20 pb  @xcite . unlike @xmath0 production ,",
    "which was well studied at lep , @xmath1 production was first observed by the cdf collaboration using approximately 1.1 fb@xmath14 of data in the @xmath19 channel where @xmath21 is either an electron or a muon  @xcite .",
    "dand cdf have both made more recent measurements in this channel by selecting events with three high @xmath12 leptons , high @xmath13 , and at least one pair of leptons with a combined invariant mass consistent with the mass of a @xmath22 boson .",
    "background processes include @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath4 , and @xmath25 production .",
    "dfinds 13 candidates in approximately 1 fb@xmath14 of data , 4.5 @xmath15 0.6 of which are expected to be background .",
    "the corresponding measured cross section is @xmath26 pb  @xcite .",
    "cdf finds 25 candidates using approximately 1.9 fb@xmath14 of data with an expected background of @xmath27 events , and a measured cross section of @xmath28 pb  @xcite .",
    "both cross section measurements are consistent with the sm prediction .",
    "in addition to measuring the cross section , both cdf and dset limits on @xmath1 production from the triple gauge coupling @xmath3 . this coupling can be described in terms of three parameters that are typically expressed as differences from their sm values , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . to set the limits ,",
    "both experiments perform one- and two - dimensional fits to their @xmath1 candidates on the @xmath12 distribution of the @xmath22 boson , which is sensitive to the coupling parameters as shown in figure  [ fig : wwz ] .",
    "no excess of @xmath3 production over the sm prediction is found .",
    "the one - dimensional , 95% cl limits set by dassuming a form factor @xmath32 tev are : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the limits set by cdf for @xmath32 tev are : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "cdf has also reported a search for combined @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in the partially hadronic decay channel @xmath39 using approximately 1.2 fb@xmath14 of data .",
    "although this process has a higher branching ratio than the fully leptonic decay channel , it has not yet been observed at a hadron collider due to the large @xmath40 background .",
    "initial selection includes requiring exactly one high @xmath12 electron or muon , significant @xmath13 , at least two jets , and a leptonic transverse mass consistent with a @xmath10 boson .",
    "a neural network is utilized to reduce the background .",
    "the signal yield , extracted from a fit to data on the dijet invariant mass distribution shown in figure  [ fig : wwwz ] , is found to be 410 @xmath15 212 ( stat ) @xmath15 102 ( syst ) . assuming this signal ( 1.7@xmath8 significance including systematics ) is from ww and wz production , the measured cross section is @xmath41 pb . a 95% cl limit is also set on the cross section : @xmath42 pb  @xcite .",
    "with a predicted nlo cross section of 1.4 @xmath15 0.1 pb , @xmath4 production is the most rare sm diboson process apart from associated higgs production  @xcite .",
    "the channels with the best sensitivity at the tevatron are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "cdf published a search for @xmath4 production using approximately 1.9 fb@xmath14 of data earlier this year  @xcite .",
    "initial selection in the @xmath43 channel requires two high @xmath12 , opposite sign electrons or muons , a cut on the dilepton invariant mass , and a maximum number of allowed high @xmath12 jets .",
    "additional @xmath13 cuts are used to reduce the dominant @xmath23 background .",
    "276 candidate events are observed , @xmath45 of which are expected to be from @xmath4 production . to distinguish this signal from the large @xmath0 background , a likelihood ratio , shown in figure  [ fig : zzcdf ] ,",
    "is constructed from event - by - event probability density functions that take into account the full event kinematics .",
    "the resulting signal has a significance of 1.2@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "d s new search for @xmath43 production using 2.7 fb@xmath14 uses similar initial selection requirements .",
    "however , in order to maximize discriminating power against the @xmath46 background , dcreates a novel @xmath13-like variable that represents the minimum possible @xmath13 in the event given the measurement uncertainties on lepton energies and hadronic recoil , shown in figure  [ fig : zzd0 ] . after cutting on this distribution , 28(15 ) @xmath47 ( @xmath48 )",
    "events are found with an expected background of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) events .",
    "a multivariate likelihood is used to distinguish @xmath4 production from the remaining backgrounds .",
    "the resulting signal has a significance of 2.6@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "although its branching ratio is six times smaller than @xmath43 , the fully leptonic decay channel is the most sensitive channel to search for @xmath4 production at the tevatron because few processes have four leptons in the final state . the dominant background , @xmath51 , is effectively suppressed by selecting two high @xmath12 pairs of electrons or muons that have a dilepton invariant mass consistent with the mass of the @xmath22 boson . in order to maximize sensitivity , the published 1.9 fb@xmath14 cdf analysis separates events into higher and lower background categories based on whether the event includes an electron that is outside of the detector s central tracking system .",
    "one such candidate is found with an expected background of @xmath52 .",
    "two candidates are found in the lower background category where the expected background yield is only @xmath53 .",
    "this results in a signal with a significance of 4.2@xmath8 .",
    "combined with the @xmath54 channel , cdf finds a 4.4@xmath8 signal for @xmath4 production and measures a cross section of @xmath55 pb , which is consistent with the sm prediction  @xcite .",
    "d s new search for @xmath44 using 1.7 fb@xmath14 also separates candidates into higher and lower purity samples .",
    "seven separate categories are considered based on the number of electrons in the central calorimeter region . in total , one @xmath56 candidate and two @xmath57 candidates are found for a total expected background of @xmath58 events .",
    "the observed significance of this result is 5.3@xmath8 .",
    "combined with the 2.7 fb@xmath14 @xmath59 search and an earlier @xmath60 search on an independent 1 fb@xmath14 dataset  @xcite , dobserves @xmath4 production with a significance of 5.7@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "d s measured cross section , @xmath61 pb , is also consistent with the sm prediction  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous production of two @xmath22 bosons from the triple gauge couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 is not permitted by the sm .",
    "both dand cdf have set limits on these anomalous couplings , described in terms of parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",

    "although this channel suffers from a large @xmath51 background , the background falls away at high values of the @xmath12 of the @xmath22 boson candidate formed from the two leptons . the dijet mass spectrum , shown in figure  [ fig : zzz ] ,",
