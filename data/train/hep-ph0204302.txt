    "the center symmetry is a prosperous implement to characterize the deconfinement transition in pure non - abelian gauge theories ( gauge theories without dynamical quarks )  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter to examine whether the symmetry is broken or not is the expectation value of the polyakov loop  @xcite , that is , the wilson line winding around the euclidean thermal torus .",

    "in contrast to pure gauge theories any definite indicator in order to distinguish the deconfined phase from confined one is not established so far yet for systems including dynamical quarks in the fundamental representation .",
    "once the thermal excitation of light quarks is allowed , the center symmetry is broken explicitly .",
    "if we construct a 3-d effective model in terms of the order parameter , namely the polyakov loop , in the presence of dynamical quarks , those quark contributions bring about an external magnetic - like field acting onto the polyakov loop , which breaks the center symmetry  @xcite .",
    "then it is obvious that the polyakov loop is no longer a proper indicator for confinement because it remains finite even in the confined phase as well as in the deconfined phase due to the absence of the center symmetry .",
    "we note , however , that the notion of confinement should be still articulate even when dynamical quarks are present simply because it is an experimental fact . to find out an appropriate indicator to identify the confined phase in the presence of dynamical quarks it is essential to clarify where the dynamical screening against the polyakov loop should originate from .",
    "in fact , detar and mclerran  @xcite argued that some fractional excitations of dynamical quarks are responsible for the explicit breaking of the center symmetry and proposed a new order parameter for the deconfinement transition based on the canonical description with respect to the quark triality or quark number .",

    "_ '' in her analysis on the z(2 ) higgs model , we can discern no clear embodiment for the statement quoted above .",
    "nevertheless , we would emphasize that this point is actually the most critical in constructing the order parameter for the deconfinement transition .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a simple and transparent demonstration to disclose what becomes of the partition function with the particle number kept fixed under the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the problem here can be also stated in more general grounds .",
    "the question is whether the grand canonical description with zero quark chemical potential is equivalent to the canonical description with zero quark number or not .",

    "mclerran s idea to project out the fractional excitations of dynamical quarks does not work because the states with zero particle density may have any fractional excitation of particles which becomes irrelevant eventually in the thermodynamic limit . then by all means",

    "in other words , any spontaneous breaking of the symmetry can not be described without external perturbation .",
    "thus even after taking the thermodynamic limit , we have vanishing @xmath73 in the absence of external perturbation regardless of whether the system lies in the confined or deconfined phase .",
    "this is what meyer - ortmanns found in her analysis .    in the presence of small perturbation denoted by @xmath79 , the phase factor",

    "we investigate the thermodynamic limit of the canonical ensemble by means of the ising model as a toy tool .",
    "the argument of the center symmetry tells us that the polyakov loop dynamics can be effectively described by the ising model with the z(2 ) symmetry for the su(2 ) gauge theory and by the potts model with the z(3 ) symmetry for the su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "in fact , such an effective description has been established also in the numerical study  @xcite .    for simplicity , we will focus here on the ising model with the z(2 ) symmetry , though the discussion is easily extended to the case of the potts model .",

    "mclerran s formulation , it would be enough to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : order2sp ] ) into @xmath104 what is important here is that the probability for configurations is specified by the symmetric part of the action .",
    "if we adopt the whole action , for example @xmath105 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : order2sp ] ) , to generate the configurations , the ensemble of configurations becomes non - ergodic in the thermodynamic limit and the would - be order parameters should inevitably fail as demonstrated in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : thermo1 ] ) and ( [ eq : thermo2 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the ensemble of configurations given by @xmath105 is unstable against configurations with @xmath106 because of the long - ranged nature of the interaction term @xmath107 . as a result",
    "the spin configurations with @xmath108 is completely decoupled from those with @xmath109 and the canonical description is reduced to the grand canonical one .",
    "the above idea is quite simple in itself . in the rest of this subsection",
    ", we will discuss the physical meaning of the above prescription to generate the ensemble of configurations with the probability specified by the symmetric part of the action .",
    "looking back at the argument around eq .",
    "( [ eq : saddle ] ) , let us reconsider the validity for the saddle - point approximation which is expected to be exact in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "once @xmath81 is really as large as of order @xmath110 , the argument given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : saddle ] ) has no suspicious controversy at all .",
    "however , going back to the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ce_qcd ] ) , we realize that the coefficient in front of @xmath20 is at most @xmath8 which is now of order @xmath111 .",
    "if we considered the thermodynamic limit where we take @xmath112 with the number density @xmath113 fixed , the aforementioned argument of the saddle - point approximation would become exact and the calculation of the canonical ensemble is absolutely identical as that in the grand canonical one , as closely discussed in ref .",
    "then the expectation value of the phase of the polyakov loop is finite and almost proportional to the quark number density  @xcite , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nq ] ) .",
    "as we have already emphasized , the canonical ensemble for the purpose of characterizing the deconfinement transition is different .",
    "what we should be confronted with is the ensemble where @xmath8 is fixed at so small number of order @xmath111 that the saddle - point approximation would be inapplicable .",
    "so as to realize this situation an additional condition is needed ; @xmath114 must be kept of order @xmath111 .",
    "this condition can be achieved in the form of the ensemble average in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : order1sp2 ] ) and ( [ eq : order2sp2 ] ) as numerically demonstrated in the next subsection .",
    "we shall summarize our findings and assertions here again .",
    "* even when the quark number is fixed in the canonical formulation , it is the quark number _ density _ that is actually fixed under the thermodynamic limit because the system becomes unstable against configurations with a macroscopic order .",
    "thus any fluctuation of the quark number of order @xmath111 is allowed even in the canonical description , though it is unintended . as a result",
    "the notion of confinement becomes obscured .",
    "* the idea is simple : if we completely get rid of the fluctuation of the quark number , which is negligible in the thermodynamic limit but responsible for screening the polyakov loop , the canonical ensemble with respect to the quark number is expected to recover its meaning",
    ". then detar ",
    "mclerran s order parameter and also the polyakov loop should serve as order parameters for the deconfinement transition .",
    "* the fluctuation of the quark number is induced by the infinitely non - local interaction arising from the projective superposition .",
    "such fluctuation can be excluded by taking the ensemble average with configurations generated by the symmetric part of the action .",
    "the asymmetric part of the action is regarded as included in the operator part to be averaged over .      by using the monte - carlo simulation ,",
    "we numerically calculate eq .  ( [ eq : order2sp2 ] ) which can be comparable with an ordinary magnetization in the presence of an external magnetic field . the lattice size is chosen as @xmath115 and we adopt the standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "the strengths of the exchange interaction and the magnetic field are @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively , where @xmath118 is the temperature .",
    "the thermalization of the spin system is well achieved after 10000 times sweeps , as can be confirmed by the magnetization distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sweep ] for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "it should be noted that the magnetization is typically of order @xmath110 in the ordered phase ( @xmath119 ) and of order @xmath111 in the disordered phase ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "in the ordered phase and the right for @xmath120 in the disordered phase.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   in the ordered phase and the right for @xmath120 in the disordered phase.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]        the resultant @xmath121 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnet ] . filled circles stand for the spontaneous magnetization in the case of @xmath122 and indicate that the spin system goes through the second - order phase transition at @xmath123 ( theoretical value ) .",
    "blank circles represent the magnetization in the presence of the magnetic field @xmath89 and show a smooth crossover as the temperature raises .",
    "we plot @xmath121 by crosses with error - bars .",
    "although we take 10000 samples by each 10 intervals , the statistical error is still large because the term @xmath124 in both the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : order2sp2 ] ) can become so large that the operator to be taken the ensemble average of must furiously fluctuate to lead to large statistical errors . in a sense",
    "we can say that this problem of slow convergence arises from the same origin as that of the sign problem for simulations at finite density , in particular , the situation is alike the glasgow method in lattice qcd at finite density .",
    "this parallelism to the sign problem will be more apparent for the order parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : order1sp2 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : order1 ] ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : limit ] the canonical partition function can vanish due to the average over the phase factor coming from the dirac determinant .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : magnet ] seem to suggest that the would - be order parameter @xmath121 should work as expected .",
    "unfortunately , at this stage , we can not address any stronger statement due to large statistical errors . in order to improve the accuracy ,",
    "some essential ingenuity such as a reweighting method  @xcite are needed rather than simple accumulation of many samples . that is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "it is easy to write down the qcd counterparts for the order parameters given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : order1sp2 ] ) and ( [ eq : order2sp2 ] ) in the spin system . here",
    "we present the expressions only for detar ",
    "mclerran s order parameter defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : detar ] ) and the polyakov loop expectation value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol ] ) . the formulation can be straightforwardly extended to general cases .",
    "the quark contribution from the dirac determinant can be expressed as the effective action in the following form ; @xmath125=\\mathrm{e}^{-s_{\\text{eff}}[u , u_4(x_4=n_\\tau)]},\\ ] ] where the link variable @xmath2 receiving a modification under the center transformation is explicitly written for convenience .",
    "we can decompose the effective action according to the triality , that is , @xmath126=\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{n=0,\\pm1}\\ ,    \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}2\\pi kn/3}\\,s_{\\text{eff}}[u , z_0^n    u_4(x_4=n_\\tau)]\\qquad ( k=0,\\pm1)\\ ] ] with @xmath127 . among the decomposed parts ,",
    "all the contributions with non - trivial triality ( @xmath128 ) are bound to be included in the operator to be averaged over .",
    "therefore the would - be order parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : detar ] ) can be written for @xmath129 as @xmath130 the ensemble average is to be taken with the probability weight specified by the symmetric part of the action , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath131-s_{\\text{eff}}^{(0)}[u]$ ] . in the same way ,",
    "the expression for eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol ] ) can be written as @xmath132",
    "in order to identify the deconfinement phase transition we employed and elaborated the idea of the canonical ensemble with respect to the quark number or triality . we clarify why the canonical ensemble would be reduced into the grand canonical ensemble eventually in the thermodynamic limit . in order to overcome the problem of the thermodynamic limit , we propose a prescription to compute the ensemble average .",
    "the idea is tested by means of an effective model in terms of spin variables in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the results seem prosperous but turn out to suffer from the severe sign problem .",
    "although our definition of the order parameter for the deconfinement transition can be applied to the monte - carlo simulation on the lattice , it is inevitably necessary to get over the sign problem inherent in the lattice qcd at finite density .",
    "we find it interesting that two serious questions ",
    "one is the criterion for the deconfinement transition at finite temperature , and the other is the sign problem in the lattice qcd at finite density  are closely related to each others .",
