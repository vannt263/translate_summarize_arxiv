    "for several years , to understand the mechanisms of the cerebral metabolism has become an important issue in neuroscience .",
    "the investigation of the neural environment allows us to better understand the activity of a cerebral region as a whole .",
    "for instance , the neural activity is composed of an interplay between excitation and inhibition where the cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) dynamics is an essential element as it reflects nutriments supplies such as oxygen and glucose .",
    "synaptic transmission @xcite and neural activity @xcite are regulated by neurotransmitters , ions and molecules .",
    "broadly speaking , at the microscopic scale , the presynaptic neuron releases neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft which may bind to postsynaptic neuron receptors .",
    "these receptors , when `` activated '' by neurotransmitters , trigger ions exchanges between the extracellular space and the postsynaptic neuron that can induce the activation of the postsynaptic neuron .",
    "parallely , neurotransmitter in the extracellular space may bind to astrocytic receptors and transporters inducing the activation of the glial calcic cycle allowing to release glutamate in the extra - synaptic space .",
    "the demonstration of the presence of transporters for glutamate and gaba in both neural and astrocyte compartments raises the question of the functional importance of the astrocytes in the regulation of the neural activity @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that glial cells and particularly astrocytes have a great impact on both the metabolic regulation @xcite and the cbf dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , astrocytes modulate the dynamics of neurotransmitter concentrations , and thus the neuronal excitability , the synaptic transmission and the neural activity .",
    "consequently , astrocytes dysfunctions are involved in several brain pathologies @xcite .",
    "studying the interactions between the neurons and astrocytes cells has therefore become an essential problem in neurophysiology and biophysics .    in this context",
    ", computational models provide a key tool for interpreting the observed electrophysiological data and for revealing the different ( patho-)physiological mechanisms which may underlie the observational data .",
    "several models including the metabolic regulation mechanisms have been proposed in the literature .",
    "some authors have built models of tripartite synapse @xcite considering an astrocyte coupled with a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic one and the dynamics of neurotransmitters , ions and molecules .",
    "other authors considered a single neuron coupled with an astrocyte @xcite and sometimes with a hemodynamic compartment @xcite and the dynamics of neurotransmitters , ions and molecules between and in these elements .",
    "recently , a new mesoscopic computational model @xcite focusing on the astrocyte dynamics has been proposed . this model links the neural activity measured by local field potentials ( lfp ) to the cbf dynamics measured by laser doppler ( ld ) recordings through glial activity .",
    "the model incorporates the astrocyte cells via their role in neurotransmitters ( glutamate and gaba ) recycling , with physiologically - relevant relationships between these variables .    in this article",
    ", we propose a model extending the one presented in @xcite for studying the neuro - glial interactions and more particularly the impact that the astrocyte activity may have upon the neuronal one .",
    "we use the same organization embedding a neural compartment and a glial one . to reproduce the mesoscopic neural activity",
    ", we use the neural mass model ( nmm ) with double excitatory feedback presented in @xcite which generalizes the jansen - rit model used in @xcite .",
    "we keep the glutamate and gaba dynamics presented in @xcite for the glial compartment . in this model ,",
    "the neural activity acts on glutamate and gaba dynamics through the pyramidal and interneuronal firing rates respectively .",
    "the essential extension in our model consists in embedding the influence of the glial dynamics upon neural activity through the glutamate and gaba extracellular concentrations .",
    "indeed , physiologically , a pyramidal cell ( resp .",
    "an interneuron ) releases glutamate ( resp .",
    "gaba ) in the synaptic cleft from where it binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron and the astrocyte .",
    "reuptake processes ( referred to as `` reuptakes '' in this article ) of the neurotransmitters by the local astrocyte and presynaptic neuron regulates their concentration in the extracellular space ( figure [ schema_ng_physio ] ) . in the presynaptic neuron , the reuptake completes the stock whereas the reuptake by the astrocyte triggers a cascade of reactions linked with the modulation of synaptic transmission ( differentially according to the type of neurotransmitters ) and the hemodynamics .",
    "hence , we introduce a feedback coupling from the glial compartment upon the neural one in our model .",
    "this feedback , referred to as the `` glial feedback '' in this article , allows us to study how different astrocyte deficiencies impact the local neuro - glial activities .",
    "if the mechanism of glutamate or gaba reuptake by the astrocytes is deficient , the neurotransmitter accumulates in the synaptic cleft , which leads to an increase in its concentration in the extracellular space .",
    "when this concentration reaches a threshold the synaptic transmission to postsynaptic neuron becomes abnormal and the postsynaptic neuron excitability threshold changes .",
    "the proposed model provides a unified framework in which knowledge of the physiology of neuron and astrocyte activities , as well as their couplings , can be incorporated , in order ( i ) to simulate the output signals for chosen parameter values , ( ii ) to identify the various qualitative responses of the whole system to physiological disorders , ( iii ) to study theoretically the conditions over the parameters corresponding to each type of response .",
    "the neural mass approach offers therefore an optimal compromise between the compactness of the dynamics , the richness of the physio - pathological mechanisms that can be reproduced , and the interpretability of the parameters from the biophysical viewpoint .",
    "the range of parameter values can be inspired from physiology - based studies in actual animal models .",
    "once the parameter range is defined , one can test the influence of varying a reduced set of parameters ( for example , ratio between excitation and inhibition or glutamate and gaba reuptake ) on the output signals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the main pathways of the neuro - glial interactions .",
    "we recall the dynamical features that explain the qualitative and quantitative properties of the time series generated by each compartment .",
    "in particular , we describe the bifurcation structure of the neural compartment underlying the generation of noise induced spiking ( nis ) outputs on which we focus in this article @xcite .",
    "we introduce the bilaterally coupled model and illustrate the main difference with the feedforward model by mimicking the injection of a gaba bolus in the extracellular space . in section 3 ,",
    "we study theoretically the effect of a deficiency of the gaba reuptake by the astrocyte upon the neural system behavior , we illustrate the result by numerical simulations and link the observed outputs with known biological results . in section 4",
    ", we identify and illustrate numerically the three possible responses of the neural compartment to a deficiency of the glutamate reuptake by the astrocyte : reduced activity , transient and permanent hyperexcitability .",
    "we explain this spectrum of responses using the analysis of the dynamical structure of the model and we derive explicit conditions on the parameters involved in the glial feedback corresponding to each type of behaviors .",
    "finally we interpret the conditions on the parameters in terms of physio - pathological features and discuss possible applications of this study for investigating experimentally the precise role of astrocyte deficiencies in neuronal hyperexcitability .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall the structure of the nmm generalizing the jansen - rit model and studied in @xcite , the way to analyze its properties and the predominant time series pattern that it generates . then we describe the model introduced in @xcite to reproduce the glial dynamics .",
    "then we explain our choice of bilateral coupling between these two compartments .",
    "finally , we illustrate its main dynamical differences with the feedforward coupling system ( _ i.e. _ unilateral coupling from the neural compartment upon the glial one ) .",
    "the nmm represents the dynamical interactions between two neural populations at a mesoscopic scale : a main population of pyramidal cells ( p ) and a population of inhibitory interneurons ( i ) .",
    "it also involves the interactions of p with a general population p representing neighboring pyramidal cells and interacting with p through synaptic connections .",
    "there are three feedback loops on population p activity : an inhibitory feedback through the interneuron population i , a direct excitatory feedback of p onto itself ( referred to as `` direct feedback '' ) and an indirect excitatory feedback ( referred to as `` indirect feedback '' ) involving the population p ( figure [ nmm](a ) ) .",

    "finally the nmm receives an excitatory input @xmath6 standing for the action on population p of neural populations in other areas through long - range synaptic connections .",
    "classically one consider @xmath6 a gaussian variable to represent a non - specific input and generate the model outputs .",

    "let us recall the bifurcation diagram underlying the predominant type of generated time series , which we will consider in this article .",

    "singular points on the upper branch are unstable ( green ) for @xmath45 and stable ( blue ) otherwise . at @xmath46",
    "the system undergoes a supercritical hopf bifurcation h@xmath39 giving birth to a stable limit cycle for @xmath45 that persists until @xmath47 where it disappears by a saddle - node on invariant circle ( snic ) bifurcation ( dashed orange line ) .",
    "the existence of the snic bifurcation is essential because it implies the appearance of a large amplitude stable limit cycle with large period .",
    "thereby , according to the value of @xmath35 , the system alternates between oscillatory phases ( for @xmath48 ) and quiescent phases ( for @xmath49 ) .",
    "in other terms , the value @xmath50 plays the role of an activation threshold for the neural compartment , which is a key point of the subsequent analysis .    note that the oscillation frequency in the generated oscillatory pattern is driven by the value of @xmath35 : as @xmath35 tends to @xmath50 from above , the limit cycle period tends to infinity .",
    "hence , the closest @xmath35 is to @xmath50 , the lowest is the frequency .",
    "consequently , when considering a gaussian input for the model , the occurrence of spikes and their frequency depend on the features of the normal distribution generating @xmath6 , which led us to refer to the corresponding pattern as noise - induced spiking ( nis ) in @xcite .    such lfp activity , _",
    "i.e. _ sparse large amplitude spikes , corresponds to episodic synchronization of the neuron activities among the populations .",

    "the model considers the dynamics of glutamate and gaba concentrations , locally to the main population p of pyramidal cells , at different stages of the recycling mechanism .",
    "the local nature of this interaction implies that the firing rate of the secondary population p of pyramidal cells does not impact the glial dynamics associated with the neighboring astrocytes of the main population p. the mechanism is as follows ( figure [ ng_sans_retroaction ] ) : excited pyramidal cells ( resp .",

    "in contrast , in the model with glial feedback ( right panels of figure [ bolus_gaba ] ) , the strong increase in gaba concentration implies a break in neural activity , and thus a decrease in glutamate concentration .",

    "the glutamate and gaba concentrations come back to their respective basal lines and oscillate under the effect of the neural spikes .",
    "these phenomenons can be explained using bifurcation - based arguments ( top panels of figure [ bolus_gaba ] ) . in the system without feedback , the neural dynamics",

    "moreover , we recall that @xmath50 plays the role of an activation threshold . thus , as long as gaba concentration remains high , the neural variables are at steady state and the neural compartment remains quiescent .",

    "this analysis shows how the model with feedback can take into account changes in glutamate and gaba dynamics to modify all the dynamics of the system and illustrates the interest of embedding the glial feedback in such neuro - glial model .",
    "our model allows us to study the effects of variations in glutamate or gaba dynamics on neural activity . in the following ,",
    "we study the effects of deficiencies in the reuptake of neurotransmitters by the astrocytes both on extracellular concentrations and neural activity .",

    "we consider an astrocyte presenting a deficiency in its gaba transporters which implies a low capacity to reuptake the extracellular gaba .",
    "a glial cell is linked with several neurons , more specifically with several synapses .",
    "thus the gaba in synaptic clefts linked with the defective astrocyte increases .",
    "consequently , the concerned post - synaptic neurons receive more inhibition from the extracellular gaba and release less neurotransmitters in the following synapses . thus , considering several defective glial cells , all neurons in a local neighborhood are affected . in summary , when glial cells present a deficiency in gaba reuptake , local neurons are more inhibited , and we expect a decrease of their activities in the corresponding simulations .    in the model , parameter @xmath67 stands for the maximum velocity of the gaba flux from the extracellular space to the astrocytes , _",

    ", only basic properties of the dynamical coupling are needed to prove the qualitative dependencies studied in sections 3 and 4 . by lack of experimental data in the literature",
    ", we chose sigmoidal functions for relaying the glial feedbacks in the simulations because they represent a paragon of bounded increasing functions involving a significant threshold effect .",
    "then , using the interpretation of the aggregated  yet biophysical ",
    "parameters involved in this model , we have reproduced _ in silico _ various types of deficiencies in the reuptake of gaba or glutamate by the astrocytes and studied their impact upon the neural activity .",
    "we took advantage of the bifurcation analysis performed in @xcite to characterize theoretically the dynamical mechanism leading to local neuronal hyperexcitability through a modulation of the snic bifurcation standing for the excitability threshold of the neural compartment .",
    "the first result concerns the impact of a deficiency in the reuptake of gaba by astrocytes which implies an increase in the gaba concentration in the extracellular space . we have shown ( proposition 1 ) that the excitability threshold @xmath50 increases linearly with the feedback term value depending on the gaba concentration in the extracellular space . hence , such an astrocyte deficiency simulated in the model results in a decrease in the frequency of neural activity , which is consistent with the biological knowledge @xcite .",
    "the second result concerns the neuronal response to a deficiency in the reuptake of glutamate by the astrocytes . in this case , the neural activity may either be reduced or enhanced or , alternatively , may experience a transient of high activity before stabilizing around a new activity state with a frequency close to the nominal one ( _ i.e. _ before induction of astrocyte deficiency ) .",
    "we have characterized ( proposition 2 and corollary 1 ) the relationships between parameters of the model for predicting the neuronal response .",
    "it is worth noticing that it is possible to calculate explicitly the snic bifurcation for the uncoupled nmm ( see @xcite ) , but not for the bilaterally coupled model embedding the glial compartment .",
    "hence , we have expressed the question of characterizing the variations in the neuronal excitability as an optimization problem under an equality constraint resulting from the implicit characterization of the saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the two model parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 involved in proposition 2 and corollary 1 represent the maximal strengths of the glutamate concentration impacts on the excitability of the pyramidal cell and the interneuron populations respectively .",
    "our model - based study shows that the neural compartment may `` resist '' to the impact of glutamate excess in the extracellular space only if the value of @xmath223 lies in a positive interval . for small values ( @xmath224 ) , the neural activity frequency",
    "is lowered , as shown in figure [ mglup2 ] , while , for high values ( @xmath225 ) , the activity frequency increases drastically and permanently , as shown in figure [ mglup3 ] . for intermediary values ,",
    "the neural activity recovers after a high frequency transient to a comparable mode despite the high values of extracellular glutamate and gaba concentrations .",
    "note that @xmath226 and @xmath227 explicitly depend on the coupling strength modulating the inhibition of the pyramidal cells activity by the interneurons ( _ i.e. _ parameter @xmath228 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only @xmath227 depends on @xmath75 .",
    "hence , one might interpret this later dependency as a balance between the glutamate - related glial feedbacks upon pyramidal cells and interneuron that the system should fulfill for being able to recover from a dysfunction in the astrocyte activity and avoid hyper - excitable behaviors .",
    "an interesting fact should be noticed for future experimental investigation based on this study : for @xmath229 , the astrocyte deficiency in capturing glutamate induces , in addition to the increase in the extracellular glutamate concentration , an increase in the gaba concentration , even greater than the one resulting from a default in gaba capture .",
    "dynamically , this increase is necessary so that the system could reach an alternative state and recover a low frequency activity , but may not be sufficient if the glial feedback on the pyramidal cells and the interneurons is unbalanced , _ i.e. _ for to large values of @xmath223 .",
    "the gaba increase induced by an excess of extracellular glutamate and the corresponding neuronal response form an experimental benchmark to identify the mechanism of the transition through hyperexcitability and potential neuronal recovery .",
    "future theoretical works will extend the analysis of the local neuro - glial dynamical interactions by studying the model response when the neuronal compartment undergoes a drastic change in its bifurcation structure induced by a deficiency in the astrocyte compartment dynamics . as a matter of fact , for other parameter values corresponding to different inter- and intra - population connectivity strengths",
    ", the neural compartment may generate other types of time series than noise - induced spiking ( nis ) among those identified in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present study can be continued to study the dynamical mechanisms underlying successive transitions through various activity regimes .",

    "<S> the investigation of the neuronal environment allows us to better understand the activity of a cerebral region as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experimental evidences of the presence of transporters for glutamate and gaba in both neuronal and astrocyte compartments raise the question of the functional importance of the astrocytes in the regulation of the neuronal activity . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new computational model at the mesoscopic scale embedding the recent knowledge on the physiology of neuron and astrocyte coupled activities . </S>",
    "<S> the neural compartment is a neural mass model with double excitatory feedback , and the glial compartment focus on the dynamics of glutamate and gaba concentrations . using the proposed model </S>",
    "<S> , we first study the impact of a deficiency in the reuptake of gaba by astrocytes , which implies an increase in gaba concentration in the extracellular space . a decrease in the frequency of neural activity </S>",
    "<S> is observed and explained from the dynamics analysis . </S>",
    "<S> second , we investigate the neuronal response to a deficiency in the reuptake of glutamate by the astrocytes . in this case , we identify three behaviors : the neural activity may either be reduced , or enhanced or , alternatively , may experience a transient of high activity before stabilizing around a new activity regime with a frequency close to the nominal one . </S>",
    "<S> after translating theoretically the neuronal excitability modulation using the bifurcation structure of the neural mass model , we state the conditions on the glial feedback parameters corresponding to each behavior . </S>",
