    "the metal - insulator transition is accompanied by the formation of a charge density wave ( cdw ) of period 3.@xcite the low - temperature phase is a mott insulator , which is caused by strong correlation of @xmath7 electrons in cooperation with electron - lattice coupling and can not be described by a band picture .",
    "in fact , the spin susceptibility in the insulating state is enhanced over the temperature - independent pauli - like paramagnetism seen in the metallic state .",
    "it has called forth theoretical studies , most of which have used mean fields@xcite  the hartree - fock approximation and the mean field approximation for slave bosons . the @xmath8 correction to the latter explains the overall phase diagram rather well .",
    "the cooperative effect has been discussed on phenomenological grounds.@xcite here we take a different approach , which qualitatively reproduces exactly known , ground - state properties near the metal - insulator transition in one dimension .    for m",
    "= ag , the ag @xmath7 level is far away from the fermi energy so that the dcnqi @xmath6 bands are quarter filled . in this sense",
    ", they are similar to ( tmttf)@xmath1x and ( tmtsf)@xmath1x salts , which are also quarter - filled and show various phases.@xcite in the latter , the 4@xmath5 anion potential has been considered to produce the umklapp process@xcite and then to cause the metal - insulator transition.@xcite such an extrinsic potential is absent in the ( @xmath0-dcnqi)@xmath1ag salts , but the metal - insulator transition occurs , accompanied by the formation of a 4@xmath5 cdw for both of the @xmath2=@xmath3= ch@xmath4 ( denoted by dme hereafter ) and @xmath2=@xmath3=i ( denoted by di hereafter ) cases.@xcite at low temperatures , ( dme - dcnqi)@xmath1ag becomes a spin - peierls state , while ( di - dcnqi)@xmath1ag becomes an antiferromagnet.@xcite thus electron correlation in the @xmath6 band also plays an essential role to determine the ground - state phases .",
    "electron correlation is essential in low dimensions . in",
    "pure one dimension , the fermi liquid is unstable against any perturbation .",
    "when the perturbation is irrelevant in terms of a renormalization group , the excitation spectrum is gapless .",
    "then the low - energy limit of the property is described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory and characterized by power laws in the density of states and various correlation functions.@xcite otherwise , the spectrum has a gap so that some of the correlation functions decay exponentially.@xcite    for the metallic ( dme - dcnqi)@xmath1cu , the single - particle spectrum has been observed in photoemission experiments and described by a power law of the electron binding energy.@xcite this suggests that the metallic phase is described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory for low but not extremely low temperatures .",
    "the exponent is much larger than the calculated one for the hubbard model or the extended hubbard model with on - site and nearest - neighbor repulsions only .",
    "however , it can be explained by long - rage interactions.@xcite the power - law holds up to the binding energy as large as 0.3 ev .",
    "this fact would also indicate a long - range interaction.@xcite recently , suppression of the interchain coherent hopping by such a large exponent in the single - particle spectrum is numerically investigated.@xcite    in the insulator phase on the other hand , the cu @xmath7 electrons are almost localized so that good one - dimensionality is expected .",
    "since the nesting is perfect and the tendency to an insulator phase is strong in one dimension when coupled with phonons , the metal - insulator transition must be explained at least in a purely one - dimensional model in order for it to occur in a quasi - one - dimensional real system .",
    "we then employ a purely one - dimensional model to study conditions for the observed mott insulator phase with a gapless spin mode .    meanwhile , ( dcnqi)@xmath1ag salts are insulators for low temperatures .",
    "one - dimensionality is expected to be better than ( dcnqi)@xmath1cu salts because the metal ion does not help the electron propagation perpendicular to the most conducting direction as in the cu salt .",
    "in fact , the one - dimensional band structure has been evidenced by the polarized reflectance spectra on single crystals.@xcite thus the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory would be a good starting point .",
    "qualitative aspects of the experimental findings are in fact explained by considering the effects of electron-2@xmath5 phonon coupling , electron-4@xmath5 phonon coupling , and slight three - dimensionality on a one - dimensional continuum model .    in one dimension ,",
    "a renormalization - group method based on the scaling law is very useful to study the effects of various perturbations .",
    "the mott transition is caused by the umklapp process .",
    "the temperature and frequency dependence of the conductivity for commensurate and nearly commensurate fillings has been studied in detail@xcite with the renormalization - group method combined with a memory - function approximation.@xcite the mott transition which occurs when the correlation strength is changed and that which occurs when the filling is changed have different physical properties , which are clarified for even and odd commensurabilities.@xcite meanwhile , the electron - phonon interaction produces the retarded attraction .",
    "its effect has also been studied with the renormalization - group method .",
    "when it contributes to the forward scattering , the backward scattering , and the umklapp process , it enhances the pairing correlation , the formation of a spin gap,@xcite and the formation of a charge gap,@xcite respectively .    here ,",
    "we apply the method to more complex systems , which have couplings with 2@xmath5 and 4@xmath5 phonons with one or two bands at even or odd commensurability . we derive and",
    "numerically solve the lowest - order equations to learn which phase the tomonaga - luttinger liquid approaches as the energy scale is lowered .",
    "although a precise description of the electronic states at strong - coupling fixed points is beyond the scope of the present method , it indicates whether each excitation spectrum has a gap or not so that the ground - state phases can be classified accordingly .",
    "such procedure reproduces qualitative tendency to the strong - coupling phases for nearly - half - filled electron - phonon systems@xcite and for a two - coupled - chain system.@xcite the present paper also follows the procedure .    to compare with experimental results , it would be necessary to take weak three - dimensionality into account .",
    "the scaling law and the consequent power - law behavior of various quantities in one dimension result from the interference of the logarithmic singularity in the 2@xmath5 particle - hole channel with that in the particle - particle channel .",
    "the contributions from the corresponding lowest - order bubble diagrams are different in signs only",
    ". quasi - one - dimensionality would be simulated by different cutoff energies for the two logarithmic singularities and the consequent imbalance between the two channels.@xcite in the m = ag case , we find that the differences between the @xmath2=@xmath3=ch@xmath4 salt of the spin - peierls ground state and the @xmath2=@xmath3=i salt of the antiferromagnetic ground state are qualitatively explained by a difference in the cutoff energy in the particle - particle channel .    in the m = cu case ,",
    "the two - band feature is essential .",
    "the interference between electron - phonon couplings , backward scatterings and umklapp processes is much more complicated in the two - band case than in the single - band case .",
    "the phonons with momenta near @xmath9 are responsible for the 4@xmath5 scattering in the sixth - filled band and for the 2@xmath5 and 4@xmath5 scatterings in the third - filled band , while the phonons with momenta near @xmath10 are responsible for the 2@xmath5 scattering in the sixth - filled band . different combinations of the above scatterings lead to different backward scattering or umklapp processes , opening charge gaps in both of the sixth - filled and third - filled bands .",
    "the insulator phase can have a spin gap only in the third - filled band ( mott insulator ) or spin gaps in both bands ( peierls insulator ) .",
    "the former phase is realized when the sixth - filled band ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath6-@xmath7 hybrid band@xcite ) has strong correlation and the electron-2@xmath5 phonon coupling is moderate . the electron-4@xmath5 phonon coupling is necessary here , though it may not be strong . the latter phase is realized when the electron-2@xmath5 phonon coupling is strong .    to study how the behavior of resistance depends on the commensurability and model parameters",
    ", we use a memory - function approximation . for m",
    "= ag , the renormalization - group method qualitatively reproduces the difference between the dme and di cases . for m",
    "= cu , the behavior of the resistance above the transition temperature is less sensitive to changes in correlation strengths than in the quarter - filled case .",
    "experimentally , the transition is of first order due to the third - order commensurability energy,@xcite and it needs three - dimensionality in phonons , which is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] introduces bosonized models based on one - dimensional continuum models with backward scatterings , umklapp processes , and couplings with 2@xmath5 and 4@xmath5 phonons .",

    "the fermi wave number is @xmath53 so that the umklapp process is written as @xmath54 \\propto   y_\\rho v_f a^{m-2 } \\int dx   \\left[\\sum_s \\psi_{1,s}^\\dagger(x ) \\psi_{2,s}(x ) \\right]^m + { \\mbox h.c . }   \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a coupling strength such that the prefactor appears simple in the phase - field representation , @xmath56 is of the order of the lattice spacing and set to be @xmath51 , and the power should be understood as point - split hereafter . with the phase - field operators , it is rewritten as @xmath54 =   \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll } ( y_\\rho v_f ) /(2\\pi\\alpha^2 )",

    "the correlation function @xmath124 is perturbationally developed and successively integrated by changing the length scale little by little . in this process , there are two possibilities for the fate of burgers vectors : a pair of neutral burgers vectors are annihilated in the larger length scale ; and a pair of non - neutral burgers vectors are combined to produce another burgers vector .",
    "the latter is important since it causes various interference effects.@xcite by comparing the correlation functions in successive length scales , we find relations between the effective parameters in the larger energy ( _ i.e. _ , smaller length ) scale and those in the smaller energy ( _ i.e. _ , larger length ) scale , which are described by differential equations ( called renormalization - group equations ) shown below .",

    "the corresponding lowest - order bubble diagrams are logarithmically divergent and have coefficients of equal magnitudes and different signs .",
    "such interference disappears in higher dimensions because the fermi surface does not consist of a finite number of points any more .",
    "though the distortion of the fermi surface removes the logarithmic singularity in the particle - hole diagram unless the nesting is perfect , the particle - particle channel generally becomes less important for repulsive interactions when only the particle - particle diagrams are summed infinitely .",
    "it is natural to regard quasi - one - dimensionality as causing imbalance between the two channels as the most important effect among all.@xcite it is realized by different cutoff energies for the two logarithmic diagrams .",
    "it should be noted that the renormalization - group equations derived from the bosonized model and the mapping to a two - dimensional classical system and those derived directly from the original fermion model are equivalent.@xcite renormalization of the velocities and detailed forms of cutoff functions if any ( _ e.g. _ , one due to a misfit parameter ) are generally different , but they are not essential .",
    "deriving the renormalization equations again in the second method , we can distinguish the contributions from the particle - particle channel and the contributions from the 2@xmath5 particle - hole channel , as already shown above .",

    "this possibility may not be excluded , but we can say at least whether the temperature dependence of the resistance within the present approach is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data or not . it will be done in the next subsection .",

    "experimentally , pressure induces the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the transition is of first order due to the third - order commensurability energy@xcite and it needs three - dimensionality in phonons , which is beyond the scope of the present study . as temperature decreases ,",

    "the 4@xmath5 cdw is therefore a product of the cooperation of the electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions .",

    "reasons why we take the one - dimensional model are : a tomonaga - luttinger behavior is observed in the metallic phase in photoemission experiments ; and the metal - insulator transition should be explained in one dimension also .    in order for gaps to open in the charge excitations in both bands and in the spin excitation in the third - filled band ,",
    "the high - order backward scattering @xmath66 must be relevant .",

    "these electron - phonon couplings interfere with one another and produce effective high - order backward and umklapp scatterings .",
    "the interference of the electron - phonon couplings and the high - order scatterings is constructive and can make @xmath66 a relevant perturbation .    in order for a gap not to open in the spin excitation in the sixth - filled band , the electron correlation must be strong enough .",
