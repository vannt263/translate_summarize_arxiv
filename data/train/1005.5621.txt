    "then , via the abel - jacobi map @xmath9 , the group of codimension @xmath3-cycles homologous to @xmath10 on @xmath1 modulo rational equivalence is up to torsion isomorphic to the intermediate jacobian @xmath4 of @xmath1 , @xmath11    this follows from the diagonal decomposition principle @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii,10.2.1 ) ) . indeed",
    ", this principle says that if @xmath1 is a smooth variety such that @xmath8 is supported on some subvariety @xmath12 , there is an equality in @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a nonzero integer and @xmath16 are codimension @xmath17 cycles with @xmath18 assuming @xmath19 , the integer @xmath15 appearing in this decomposition is easily checked to annihilate the kernel and cokernel of @xmath9 .",
    "note that the integer @xmath15 appearing above can not in general be set equal to @xmath6 , and one purpose of this paper is to investigate the significance of this invariant , at least if we work on the level of cycles modulo homological equivalence .",
    "we will focus in this paper to the case of @xmath17-folds with @xmath20 group supported on a curve . in this case , the diagonal decomposition ( [ decompintro ] ) has a term @xmath21 supported on @xmath22 , for subvariety @xmath23 of @xmath1 of dimension @xmath24 .",

    "we will say that @xmath1 admits an _ integral cohomological decomposition of the diagonal _ if one has such a decomposition with @xmath28 .",
    "recall that the existence of a cohomological decomposition of the diagonal as above has strong consequences ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore the intermediate jacobian @xmath33 is an abelian variety ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the abel - jacobi map @xmath34 is surjective .",
    "going further and using the theory of bloch - ogus @xcite together with merkurjev - suslin theorem , bloch and srinivas also prove the following :    @xcite [ blochsrinivasgriffnul ] if @xmath1 is a smooth projective complex variety such that @xmath8 is supported on a surface , the griffiths group @xmath35 is identically @xmath10 .",
    "the last result can not be obtained as a consequence of the diagonal decomposition , which only shows that under the same assumption @xmath36 is annihilated by the integer @xmath15 introduced above .",

    "the group on the left does not have a priori the structure of an algebraic variety , unlike the group on the right .",
    "however it makes sense to say that @xmath9 is algebraic , meaning that for any smooth algebraic variety @xmath39 , and any codimension @xmath3-cycle @xmath40 , with @xmath41 for any @xmath42 , the induced map @xmath43 is a morphism of algebraic varieties .",
    "consider the case of a uniruled @xmath44-fold @xmath1 with @xmath8 supported on a curve .",
    "then it is proved in @xcite ( cf .",
    "theorem [ theovoisinuniruled ] ) that the integral degree @xmath7 cohomology @xmath45 is generated over @xmath46 by classes of curves , and thus the birational invariant @xmath47,\\,z\\subset y,\\,{\\rm codim } \\,z=2>}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] studied in @xcite and @xcite ( see also section [ subsectionintro ] ) , is trivial in this case .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is the following theorem concerning the group @xmath48 for certain fourfolds fibered over curves .",

    ", such a result can be obtained as a consequence of the study of the geometric properties of the abel - jacobi map for the fibers of @xmath51 . in the case of the complete intersection of two quadrics in @xmath50 ,",

    "i thank the referee for pointing out this application .",
    "another motivation for this study is the following : the conclusion of the above mentioned theorems [ blochsrinivasgriffnul ] , [ introimprove ] and [ theovoisinuniruled ] is that for a uniruled threefold with @xmath20 supported on a curve , all the interesting ( and birationally invariant ) phenomena concerning codimension @xmath3 cycles , namely the kernel of the abel - jacobi map ( mumford @xcite ) , the griffiths group ( griffiths @xcite ) and the group @xmath53 versus degree @xmath44 unramified cohomology with torsion coefficients ( soul - voisin @xcite , colliot - thlne - voisin @xcite ) are trivial . in the rationally connected case",
    ", the only interesting cohomological invariant could be the artin - mumford invariant ( or degree @xmath3 unramified cohomology with torsion coefficients , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which is also equal to the brauer group since @xmath55 .",
    "still the geometric structure of the abel - jacobi map on families of @xmath6-cycles on such threefolds is mysterious , in contrast to what happens in the curve case , where abel s theorem shows that the abel - jacobi map on the family of effective @xmath10-cycles of large degree has fibers isomorphic to projective spaces .",
    "another goal of this paper is to underline substantial differences between @xmath6-cycles on threefolds with small @xmath20 on one side and @xmath10-cycles on curves on the other side , coming from geometry of the fibers of the abel - jacobi map .",
    "there are for example two natural questions ( questions [ question1 ] and [ question2 ] ) left open by theorem [ introimprove ] :    [ question1 ] let @xmath1 be a smooth projective threefold , such that @xmath56 is surjective .",
    "is there a codimension @xmath3 cycle @xmath57 with @xmath41 for @xmath58 , such that the induced morphism @xmath59 is the identity ?",
    "note that the surjectivity assumption is conjecturally implied by the vanishing @xmath60 , via the generalized hodge conjecture ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    although the _ geometric _ study of the abel - jacobi map will lead to consider flat families of curves on @xmath1",
    ", we do not ask that the cycle @xmath61 above is a combination of codimension @xmath3 algebraic subsets @xmath62 which are flat over @xmath63 . for a cycle",
    "@xmath64 , this would be needed to define properly the restricted cycle @xmath65 if the base @xmath39 of a family of cycles @xmath40 was not smooth , but when it is smooth , we can use the restriction map @xmath66 defined by fulton @xcite .",
    "one can more precisely introduce a birational invariant of @xmath1 defined as the gcd of the non zero integers @xmath15 for which there exist a variety @xmath39 and a cycle @xmath40 as above , with @xmath67 .",
    "question [ question1 ] can then be reformulated by asking whether this invariant is equal to @xmath6 .",

    "the following question is an important variant of the previous one , which appears to be much more natural in specific geometric contexts ( see section [ secfibrecub ] ) .",
    "[ question2 ] is the following property ( * ) satisfied by @xmath1 ?    ( * ) there exists a mooth projective variety @xmath39 and a codimension @xmath3 cycle @xmath40 , with @xmath41 for any @xmath73 , such that the induced morphism @xmath74 is surjective with rationally connected general fiber .",
    "this question has been solved by iliev - markushevich and markushevich - tikhomirov ( @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite for similar results obtained independently ) in the case where @xmath1 is a smooth cubic threefold in @xmath75 .",
    "the answer is also affirmative for the intersection @xmath52 of two quadrics in @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : in this case the family of lines in @xmath52 is a surface isomorphic via a choice of base point to the intermediate jacobian @xmath76 .",
    "obviously a positive answer to question [ question1 ] implies a positive answer to question [ question2 ] , as we can then just take @xmath77 . we will provide a more precise relation between these two questions in section [ newsubsection ]",
    "however , it seems that question [ question2 ] is more natural , especially if we go to the following stronger version ( [ q3 ] ) that we wish to partially investigate in this paper :    here we choose an integral cohomology class @xmath78 .",
    "assuming @xmath8 is supported on a curve , the hodge structure on @xmath79 is trivial and thus @xmath70 is a hodge class .",
    "introduce the torsor @xmath80 defined as follows : the deligne cohomology group @xmath81 is an extension @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the natural map from deligne to betti cohomology ( cf .",

    ".    this question is solved by castravet in @xcite when @xmath1 is the complete intersection of two quadrics .",
    "let us comment on the importance of question [ q3 ] in relation with the hodge conjecture with integral coefficients for degree @xmath7 hodge classes , ( that is the study of the group @xmath48 introduced in ( [ z4y ] ) ) : the important point here is that we want to consider fourfolds fibered over curves , or families of threefolds @xmath96 parameterized by a curve @xmath97 .",
    "the generic fiber of this fibration is a threefold @xmath1 defined over @xmath98 .",
    "property ( * * ) essentially says that property ( * ) , being satisfied over the definition field , which is in this case @xmath98 , holds in family .",
    "when we work in families , the necessity to look at all torsors @xmath80 , and not only at @xmath4 , becomes obvious : for fixed @xmath1 the twisted jacobians are all isomorphic ( maybe not canonically ) and if we can choose a cycle @xmath99 in each given class @xmath70 ( for example if @xmath1 is uniruled so that @xmath100 ) , we can use translations by the @xmath99 to reduce the problem to the case where @xmath101 ; this is a priori not true in families , for example because non trivial torsors @xmath102 may appear .",
    "we will give more precise explanations in section [ subsectionintro ] and explain one application of this property to the hodge conjecture for degree @xmath7 integral hodge classes on fourfolds fibered over curves .",

    "however many such fourfolds @xmath52 are rational over the base , ( that is , birational to @xmath104 ) : this is the case for example if there is a section of the family of lines in the fibers of @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath52 is rational over the base , the vanishing of @xmath53 is immediate because the group @xmath53 of ( [ z4y ] ) is a birational invariant of @xmath52 .    by the results of @xcite",
    ", theses results can also be translated into statements concerning degree @xmath44 unramified cohomology with @xmath105-coefficients of such fourfolds ( see section [ subsectionintro ] ) .",
    "our second result relates question [ question2 ] to the existence of a cohomological integral decomposition of the diagonal as in ( [ decompintro ] ) .",
    "recall first ( see @xcite ) that the intermediate jacobian @xmath4 of a smooth projective threefold @xmath1 with @xmath60 is naturally a principally polarized abelian variety , the polarization @xmath106 being given by the intersection form on @xmath107 .",

    "hence in this case , this theorem mainly relates question [ question2 ] to the existence of a cohomological decomposition of the diagonal .",

    "then question [ question1 ] also has an affirmative answer for @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secfibrecub ] , we give a positive answer to question [ question2 ] for general cubic threefolds .",
    "we deduce from this theorem [ cubiqueintro ] .",
