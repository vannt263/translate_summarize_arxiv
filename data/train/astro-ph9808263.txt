    "elliptical galaxies ( es ) are not randomly distributed in the three - dimensional space defined by the observed parameters : central velocity dispersion @xmath5 , effective radius @xmath6 and the surface brightness @xmath7 within @xmath6 .",
    "they occupy with very small dispersion a planar surface ( dressler _ et al . _  1987 ;",
    "djorgovski and davis 1987 ) , called the _ fundamental plane _ ( fp ) .",
    "thus the fp defines a correlation between the luminosity , size and dynamical mass of a galaxy . with the aim of a more transparent view on the physical properties of es , bender , burstein & faber ( 1992 ; hereafter bbf ) analysed the virgo and coma cluster elliptical fp in the @xmath4-band , by introducing a convenient orthogonal coordinate system ( known as the _ @xmath8-space _ ) , in which the new variables are linear combinations of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in this frame , the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane is an almost edge - on view of the fp ( see bbf , fig .  1 ) .",
    "the main properties of the bbf es fp are 1 ) the so - called _ tilt _ , i.e.  the systematic increase of @xmath13 along the fp ( @xmath14 ) and 2 ) its tightness , i.e.  the very small dispersion of @xmath13 , @xmath15 at every location on the fp . using the virial theorem ,",
    "the @xmath8-coordinates can be related to the total galaxy mass , @xmath16 , by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "if the virial coefficient @xmath19 is constant for all the galaxies ( or , es form an _",
    "family ) , the observed fp tilt implies that @xmath20 increases by a factor @xmath21 3 with galactic mass .",
    "the physical origin of the fp tilt is still at the debate ( see also pahre _ et al .",
    "_ ,  this volume ) , but it can be sought in two _ orthogonal _ directions : either it is due to a _ stellar population _",
    "effect , in which case @xmath0 scales with the luminosity ( mass ) of the galaxies and @xmath19 is constant . or _",
    "structural / dynamical _ homology is broken , in which case @xmath0 is constant and @xmath19 varies along the galaxy sequence .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to explore the former option , the structural / dynamical one being extensively discussed in , e.g. , ciotti , lanzoni & renzini ( 1996 ) .    from an observational point of view",
    ", the slope @xmath22 of the fp scaling relation , @xmath23 , is found to increase systematically with wavelenght , from the @xmath24-band to the @xmath25-band ( see the contribution by pahre _",
    "et al . _",
    "in this volume and references therein ) .",
    "this points towards systematic variations of the stellar content along the es sequence , which also gets support from systematic trends in colours and line strenghts with galaxy luminosity ( hence with @xmath26 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios of stellar populations change with age , chemical composition , and initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the imf effect has been explored by renzini & ciotti ( 1993 ) .",
    "their main conclusion is that a strong _ fine tuning _ is required to produce the observed tilt of the fp , preserving the constant thickness : the imf should be virtually universal for a given galaxy mass , and yet exhibit a large trend with galaxy mass .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of the @xmath27 relation ( see bender , burstein & faber 1993 ) and the colour - magnitude relation ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; see also kodama , this volume ) of es is in terms of increasing metallicity along the galaxy sequence .",
    "this effect on @xmath0 is explored for the @xmath28-band in renzini ( 1995 ) . in this work , the effect of metallicity and age on the @xmath0 ratio is analysed for several photometric bands .",
    "this is part of a more extended work which aimes at determining _",
    "what fraction of the observed fp tilt is produced by stellar population effects _",
    ", through the comparison of the fp at different wavelenghts ( maraston & renzini 1998 , _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "models for simple stellar populations ( ssp ) are computed with the evolutionary synthesis approach described in maraston ( 1998 ; hereafter m98 ) , in which the fuel consumption theorem ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) is used to evaluate the energetic of post main sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "the input stellar tracks for the ssp models presented here are taken from cassisi ( _ private communication _ ; see also bono _ et al . _",
    "they are computed by means of the franec evolutionary code ( see chieffi & straniero 1989 ) .",
    "the range in metallicity is @xmath29}=[-1.3\\div0.3]$ ] , with helium - enrichment @xmath30=2.5 ; age varies from 3 gyr to 15 gyr .",
    "we refer to maraston ( 1998 , _ in preparation _ ) for more details .",
    "the imf is assumed to follow the usual power - law , @xmath31 .",
    "besides the salpeter slope ( @xmath32=1.35 ) , we explore the multislope case with a break at low masses , as recently suggested by gould , flynn & bahcall ( 1997 ; hereafter gbf97 ) on the basis of hst observations of disk @xmath33 dwarfs .",
    "depending on the mass range , the adopted slopes are : @xmath32=0 for @xmath34 , @xmath32=1.21 for @xmath35 and @xmath32=1.35 otherwise .",
    "the upper and lower mass cutoffs are fixed at 100 @xmath36 and 0.1 @xmath36 respectively in both cases .",
    "the synthetic @xmath37 ratios contain the contribution by stellar remnants . as a stellar population ages , stars progressively die , leaving remnants , that only contribute to the mass of the population .",
    "the mass lost in the form of ejected gas is supposed to be blown out of the stellar population .",
    "the total mass of an ssp of age @xmath38 , @xmath39 , is thus obtained by convolving the stellar mass @xmath40 with the imf , with @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the initial main sequence mass , the turnoff mass and the remnant mass , respectively . for the remnant mass",
    "we adopt the same recipe as in m98 and renzini & ciotti ( 1993 ) .",
    "we do not take the dependence of @xmath47 on metallicity into account , since it implies difference in @xmath47 of the order of @xmath48 .    at fixed age",
    ", @xmath39 is fairly insensitive to the metal content because @xmath49(t ) does not change appreciably with the chemical composition : for a 15 gyr ssp , the variation of @xmath49(t ) is at most 0.15 @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath39 computed with a salpeter imf is @xmath21 2.5 times greater than the one for the gbf97 imf , since the latter contains less low - mass stars . due to the slow evolution of @xmath50 at old ages ( @xmath51 1 gyr ) ,",
    "the influence of age on @xmath39 is very mild ( see m98 for more details ) . in the age range @xmath52 gyr",
    ", @xmath39 varies only by a factor of @xmath53 , independent of the chemical composition .      .",
    "[ mlgen ] shows the effect of metallicity on mass - to - light ratios .",
    "the @xmath37 ratio for various photometric bands ( from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , from top to bottom ) as a function of metallicity ( for 15 gyr , salpeter imf ssps ) is shown .",
    "in general , the @xmath37 ratio increases with increasing metallicity .",
    "this pattern is more prominent in the @xmath24-band and decreases systematically with increasing wavelenght , leading to a basically flat function in the @xmath54 bands .    .",
    "[ mlconz ] shows the systematic trend induced by metallicity on @xmath2 and @xmath55 ( left - hand and right - hand panel , respectively ) , for the two different imfs adopted .",
    "@xmath2 is found to increase by a factor @xmath56 when @xmath29}$ ] increases from @xmath57 solar to two times solar .",
    "this range in metal content is roughly consistent with the one spanned by bbf es ( see renzini 1995 and references therein ) , and the bbf fp in the @xmath4-band is tilted in a way that implies a @xmath58 variation of @xmath21 3 _ if the assumption of homology holds _",
    "( see sec . 1 . ) .",
    "a _ pure metallicity effect _ thus suffices to explain the fp tilt observed in the @xmath4-band",
    ". if the low bright es of bbf sample have @xmath29}$ ] @xmath59 ( half - solar ) then the metallicity effect explains @xmath60 of the observed tilt .",
    "these results are for @xmath61=2.5 ; it remains to be investigated if this is appropriate for the bbf es ( see renzini 1995 ) .",
    "to assess what fraction of the fp tilt is due to metallicity effects , the trend of the tilt with wavelenght has to be examined .",
    "in fact , in the whole metallicity range here considered , the @xmath0 ratios in the ir are nearly constant ( see fig",
    ".  [ mlconz ] , right - hand panel for the @xmath25 band ) .",
    "this scope will be pursued in a future paper ( maraston & renzini , _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "[ mlconz ] shows that the two imfs considered here manifest themselves only in the absolute values of @xmath37 , the systematic trends discusses above being not affected .",
    "this follows from @xmath62 being fairly independent on the chemical composition ( see maraston 1998 , _ in preparation _ for a wider discussion ) .",
    "besides metallicity , age induces a systematic trend in the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "here we briefly comment on this point .",
    "[ mlconage ] shows the age effect on @xmath0 in the @xmath4 and @xmath25 bands ( left - hand and right - hand panel , respectively ) for the gbf97 imf . for the fixed solar metallicity @xmath29}$]=0 , a variation by a factor of @xmath63 3 in @xmath2",
    "is achieved , if age increases from @xmath21 5 gyr to @xmath21 15 gyr along the galaxy sequence . in this same age range ,",
    "@xmath55 varies by a factor of @xmath64 . to accept the age solution , a highly syncronisation in the formation process of the es of given luminosity ( mass )",
    "is required , in order to preserve the small fp scatter ( see sec . 1 . ) .",
    "we have explored the systematic trends induced by metallicity and age on synthetic mass - to - light ratios , in which the contribution by stellar remnants is taken into account .",
    "the main result is that a pure metallicity effect is capable to explain the variation of @xmath2 observed in the bbf sample of cluster ellipticals , if @xmath29}$ ] increases from @xmath65 to @xmath66 along this galaxy sequence .",
    "@xmath0 ratios in the ir bands are instead predicted to display a flat trend with the chemical composition ( cf .",
    "[ mlconz ] ) .",
    "the slope of the fp is found to increase with wavelenght ( pahre _ et al .",
    "_ ,   this volume ) : the exponent @xmath67 of the fp standard form @xmath23 is @xmath68 for the bbf fp in the @xmath4-band and @xmath69 for the pahre _",
    "_  fp in the ir .",
    "the amplitude of the increase is thus modest , and a puzzling situation appears , in which other effects , like non - homology , have to be assumed to work differentially with wavelenght , which obviously should not be the case .",
    "moreover , a part of the tilt is certainly due to metallicity effects , as chemical composition varies along the es sequence .",
    "we find indeed that these effects explain @xmath70 of the fp tilt in the @xmath4-band , depending on the real metallicity range spanned by the bbf sample .",
    "it is interesting to mention , however , that the tilt of the ir fp in the _",
    "@xmath8-space _ derived by pahre _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) does not deviate from the bbf one in the @xmath4-band ( see sec",
    ". 1 . ) .",
    "the author is indebted with santi cassisi , for kindly providing the stellar tracks in advance of publication , and with alvio renzini , laura greggio , ralf bender and michael andrew pahre for many interesting discussions .",
    "a special thank to daniel thomas .",
    "maraston this effect is the result of the conspiracy between the amount of total energy at an ssp disposal and the effective temperatures at which this energy is emitted . for @xmath73 , passing from @xmath29}\\sim -0.5 $ ] to @xmath29}\\sim + 0.3 $ ] , the specific fuel burned in the red giant branch by an ssp decreases by a factor @xmath21 1.32 .",
    "the reason of this is simply that the percentage in mass of hydrogen , that is always the major source of energy , decreases from @xmath21 0.75 to @xmath21 0.62 , for @xmath73 and the values of @xmath29}$ ] here considered .",
    "but the fuel burned is released at cooler effective temperatures in a metal rich population .",
    "thus the infrared emission is not too much metal dependent .",
