    "the past decade has seen a series of anomalies emerge in short baseline ( sbl ) neutrino oscillation experiments which can not be explained within the three active neutrino framework of the standard model ( sm ) . here",
    ", sbl refers to experiments with the ratio of the oscillation distance over the neutrino energy , @xmath1 , which are sensitive to neutrino oscillations involving mass squared splittings @xmath2 .",
    "the lsnd experiment @xcite reports evidence of @xmath3 oscillation consistent with @xmath2 , as well as a less dramatic excess for @xmath4 oscillation  @xcite .",
    "the miniboone collaboration also searched for the same signal , reporting excesses in both electron and anti - electron neutrino events  @xcite , again suggesting oscillations of the form @xmath4 and @xmath3 , consistent with the lsnd results .",
    "together , these observations lead to the tantalizing suggestion of additional `` sterile '' neutrino flavors at a mass scale of @xmath5 .",
    "many schemes have been considered to fit the excess , including 3 active plus @xmath6 sterile neutrino oscillation schemes ( 3+@xmath6 ) , with most of the attention being focused on @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "while even the simple 3 + 1 scheme can provide a good fit to the @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) appearance excesses , these fits are in tension with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 disappearance constraints from miniboone+sciboone  @xcite and lsnd+karmen @xcite , respectively . to ameliorate the disappearance constraint ,",
    "some authors have also considered fairly prompt decay of sterile neutrinos @xcite ( _ i.e. _ @xmath12 ) to allow the decay of sterile neutrinos to active neutrinos within the experimental lengths . in most cases ,",
    "a decay of this form requires the coupling of neutrinos to a new light state @xmath13 ( potentially a majoron  @xcite ) , which enables the sterile neutrinos to decay through the process @xmath14 . while some authors have also considered decays of the form @xmath15 @xcite to explain the miniboone signal , this decay can not explain the lsnd excess and we will not consider it here",
    ".    very little attention has been focused on the 3 + 3 oscillation scheme , mainly in the interest of minimality and because there was no clear indication that adding a third sterile neutrino would improve the 3 + 2 fit . however",
    ", when the sterile neutrino sector is embedded within a model that  mirrors \" the sm particle content  @xcite , the 3 + 3 scenario becomes natural to consider .",
    "one well motivated model of this type is the  twin higgs \" model  @xcite , although others have been considered @xcite .",
    "the twin higgs model contains a full or partial copy of the sm gauge group and particle content , with couplings in the two sectors related by a discrete @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "the particle content in each sector , usually denoted @xmath17 and @xmath18 , transforms under its own gauge group and is sterile with respect to the other sector .",
    "an attractive feature of the twin higgs model is that it provides a solution to the little hierarchy problem without requiring new particles charged under the sm gauge group , at least below the cutoff of the effective theory . in this model ,",
    "the higgs field is a pseudo - nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) associated with spontaneous breaking of an approximate global @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "a twin @xmath16 symmetry is introduced to constrain the form of corrections to the pngb higgs potential , allowing natural electroweak symmetry breaking with no quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass at one - loop level .    in this paper , we construct a 3 + 3 neutrino model within the twin higgs framework , although many of our phenomenological studies can be applied to other models with similar flavor structures .",
    "two higher dimensional operators turn out to be relevant for the neutrino sectors .",
    "the first operator is dimension - five and respects both the @xmath16 and @xmath19 symmetries .",
    "after the higgs fields develop their vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) , three out of the total six neutrinos become massive and can be identified as the three sterile neutrinos . because of @xmath16-enforced yukawa alignment between the two sectors , only one universal mixing angle in addition to the usual pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix is required to describe how the three sterile neutrinos interact with the sm charged leptons .",
    "this mixing angle @xmath20 is predicted to be the ratio of two higgs vev s , @xmath21 , and has the right order of magnitude to fit the sbl excesses .",
    "the second relevant operator is dimension - six , which is @xmath16-conserving and @xmath19-breaking .",
    "it is responsible for coupling the majoron to neutrinos and additionally for providing mass to the light active neutrinos .",
    "we will show that after satisfying various constraints , the three heavy sterile neutrinos can decay into active neutrinos plus one majoron with the decay distance within the experimental lengths . in what follows",
    ", we will analyze oscillation and decay of dirac and majorana sterile neutrinos within the context of this 3 + 3  twin neutrino \" model .",
    "we will show that promptly decaying sterile neutrinos in this model can provide a good fit to the lsnd and miniboone anomalies .",
    "motivated by the twin higgs model , we consider a global non - abelian @xmath19 symmetry in the electroweak parts of both the sm and twin sectors .",
    "the two higgs doublets @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which transform under @xmath24 and @xmath25 gauge symmetries , can be grouped together as a quadruplet of @xmath19 : @xmath26 . at the minimum of its @xmath19 invariant potential ,",
    "the quadruplet develops a vev of @xmath27 , spontaneously breaking @xmath19 down to its @xmath28 subgroup . as a result , there are seven nambu - goldstone - bosons ( ngb s ) in the low energy theory below the cutoff @xmath29 . turning on electroweak gauge interactions in both sectors",
    ", the quadruplet vev breaks the twin electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath30 to a single @xmath31 with three ngb s eaten by the three massive gauge bosons @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the remaining four ngb s can be identified as the sm higgs doublet , @xmath34 , which acquire mass and become pngb s after turning on @xmath19 breaking gauge or yukawa interactions .",
    "the little hierarchy problem can be alleviated by imposing an additional @xmath35 symmetry between the two sectors which forces all couplings to be the same .",
    "this is because in the gauge sector , the one loop corrections to the higgs mass which are quadratic in @xmath36 have the form @xmath37 and are independent of the pngb higgs field . in addition , the logarithmically divergent part contributes to the coefficient of the @xmath19-breaking operator @xmath38 at the order of @xmath39 , so the higgs field mass is generically suppressed compared to the vev @xmath40  tev . to obtain the lighter higgs boson mass at 125 gev",
    ", the coefficient is needed to be around 1/4 , which suggests additional @xmath19 breaking terms in the scalar potential . minimizing the potential for the two higgs doublets with small @xmath16-breaking terms , the ratio of the two vev s is = ~o(0.1 ) , with the electroweak vev , @xmath41  gev .",
    "later we will show that this ratio will be crucial to determine the fermion mass spectrum in the twin sector .",
    "the fermion yukawa couplings explicitly break the global @xmath42 ) symmetry .",
    "the @xmath16 twin parity is required to ensure that there are no corrections to the sm higgs mass proportional to @xmath43 at the one - loop level .",
