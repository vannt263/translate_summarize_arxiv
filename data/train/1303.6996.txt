    "narrowing of the eit resonances could be accomplished by reducing @xmath56 or using isotopically pure diamond .",
    "optimal sensitivity could also be realized by actively applying an appropriate bias field .",

    "the sensitivity falls off by a factor of @xmath225 under a bias field , @xmath226 . for the effective field @xmath227 present in our sample , this value is @xmath228 .",
    "fortunately , this bias field is comparable to the bias field where @xmath198 is optimal , @xmath219 , ensuring that high - sensitivity electrometry and magnetometry can be simultaneously realized .",
    "the electric - field sensitivity quoted here is for fields inside of diamond .",
    "if the goal of the electrometer is to sense external charges / fields , one needs to account for dielectric screening . in most geometries ,",

    "the signal from a commercial fluxgate magnetometer , placed close to the position of the diamond , was recorded .",
    "however , in all these cases , the noise was absent .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the fluxgate magnetometer also picked up magnetic noise at @xmath249 of a similar amplitude to the noise peak recorded by the eit magnetometer [ fig .",
    "[ fig : eitmag](c ) in the main text ] .",
    "however the noise floor near @xmath137 was @xmath9 .",
    "we estimate that ac stark shifts of order @xmath250 , are present under our typical operating conditions .",
    "this was confirmed by eit spectra obtained from the nine - level model described above .",
    "consequently fluctuations in @xmath56 of @xmath251 lead to variations in magnetometer output of order a few nt .",
    "such fluctuations are consistent with the magnitude of the noise .",
    "we note that fluctuations in power also cause the overall transmission to change , but this generally happens slow compared to our modulation frequency ( 89 khz ) so it does not show up in the magnetometer signal ( as evidenced by the lack of the noise when @xmath52 was detuned @xmath248 ) .",
    "the ac - stark fluctuations may be caused by vibrations due to turbulent cryostat flow and/or vibrations of the transfer line connecting the cryostat to the liquid helium dewar .",
    "future low - frequency applications may benefit from active power stabilization or post - processing the magnetometer signal based on monitoring the power .",
