    "the observation of neutrino oscillations @xcite , which provides compelling evidence for nonzero neutrino masses , has long indicated to us that the minimal standard model ( sm ) is incomplete and must be extended .",
    "meanwhile , astrophysical and cosmological data have given us ample important hints regarding the missing mass of the universe @xcite , prompting many theorists to build new models for accommodating such dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "so , there is no shortage of motivation for developing physics beyond the sm .",
    "in addition to these , it is well - known that the problem of generating a primordial baryon asymmetry @xcite must also bring together the studies of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "most notably , in models of thermal leptogenesis @xcite , the sm is extended to include lepton violating interactions so that baryogenesis can be originated from a lepton asymmetry while neutrino masses are naturally generated via the type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite . in the light of this , it is perhaps most interesting to explore extensions to the sm that can address all three issues of baryon asymmetry , dark matter and neutrino masses simultaneously .    to construct a model that can achieve this , we first note that a popular candidate for the role of the non - baryonic dm is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) @xcite .",
    "a key feature in the wimp - like models is that they typically require an extra symmetry beyond the sm to ensure the stability of the dm candidate ( e.g. r - parity in supersymmetric theories ) .",
    "however , such new symmetries are often introduced solely for the purpose of stabilizing the dm and nothing else , making them rather ad - hoc .",
    "thus , it may be better to build up from a `` minimal dm '' approach @xcite where renormalizability and sm gauge invariance are the only requirements .",
    "it has already been shown that realistic dm models based on this idea can be built @xcite , and they involve exotic electroweak multiplets of particles .",
    "secondly , it was pointed out in the seminal work of @xcite that there could be a natural link between wimp dm and neutrinos if the neutrino masses are generated radiatively .",
    "such link is possible when there is a symmetry which forbids any particles except the left - handed ( lh ) lepton doublet to couple to the dm candidate , and the higgs potential is arranged such that this symmetry remains unbroken after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "our primary aim in this work is to present an exotic multiplet model which can be a consistent solution to neutrinos , dm and baryon asymmetry by amalgamating the two observations above .",
    "we shall demonstrate in the subsequent sections that by introducing a set of exotic multiplets with the appropriate sm transformation properties , the lightest exotic particle can be the dm candidate ; neutrinos can develop a mass via one - loop diagrams ; while baryogenesis can be achieved via the cp asymmetric decays of the second lightest exotic particles .",
    "in order to construct a consistent solution to baryon asymmetry , dark matter and neutrino masses , we extend the particle content of the minimal sm by adding _ three _ right - handed ( rh ) fermion multiplets , @xmath0 , and _ one _ scalar multiplet , @xmath1 , with sm gauge transformation properties : n_k ~(1,5,0 ) , k , ~(1,6,-1/2 ) respectively .",
    "this is in fact the most minimalist choice one may choose for @xmath2 and @xmath1 if one adopts the `` minimal dm '' idea of @xcite and demands that the lightest fermion 5-plet here be the dark matter . other smaller multiplet combinations for these new particles will result in unwanted terms in the scalar potential which can destabilize our dark matter candidate , or give phenomenologically unacceptable component fields that have fractional charges ( see @xcite for a good discussion on this point ) .",
    "the main reason for introducing three ( rather than a lesser number of ) @xmath2 s is because it is the smallest number such that all allowable light neutrino mass patterns can be accommodated by the model . with the inclusion of the new fields ,",
    "the lagrangian of interest is _",
    "= i _ k n_k + ( d^)^(d _ ) - - v_s , where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-flavor lh lepton doublet , @xmath5 denoting the sm covariant derivative , and @xmath6 is the @xmath7-element of the yukawa coupling matrix which is assumed to be complex . without loss of generality",
    ", we have chosen to work in the basis where @xmath8 ( the @xmath2 mass matrix ) is real and diagonal .",
    "the scalar potential , @xmath9 , is given by v_s = _",
    "^2 ^ + _ ^2 ^ + ( ^)^2 + ( ^)^2 _ + _ ( ^ ^ ) _ + , with @xmath10 being the sm higgs doublet which transform as @xmath11 under the sm gauge group . to simplify the subsequent discussion on how potential @xmath9 can ensure that there is a dark matter candidate in this model and the stability of the vacuum solution , we will assume that all couplings in ( [ eqn : v_s ] ) are real .",
    "the subscripts @xmath12 and @xmath13 in ( [ eqn : v_s ] ) denote the many independent ways to contract the components of the su(2 ) multiplets involved , and we sum over them .",
    "for example , the term @xmath14 , which is a tensor product of representations @xmath15 can be contracted in the following ways ( see appendix  [ app : cg_coef ] for the relevant clebsch - gordon coefficients ) _ + _ + + _ + _ ^ * + ^ * _ ^ * + ^ * _ + .",
    "note , however , that not all possible expansions in ( [ eqn:2266contract ] ) are independent of each other , in the sense that some of the resulting singlets are actually linear combinations of other possible singlets .",
    "similar conclusions can also be drawn for the contraction of the other terms in @xmath9 .",
    "a careful analysis of the lagrangian in ( [ eqn : main_lag ] ) will reveal that the lightest neutral component of the newly introduced multiplets can be a dark matter candidate as long as the parameters of @xmath9 are such that scalar 6-plet @xmath1 does _ not _ develop a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "this is because when @xmath16 , the lightest exotic particle has no means to decay in this model .",
    ", cross terms such as @xmath17 will allow the lightest exotic particle to decay into sm particles . ] for the @xmath9 depicted , this vacuum condition can be achieved by choosing all couplings which involve @xmath1 to be positive .",
    "it will become apparent later that such freedom to tune the parameters will not be affected by any of the constraints coming from successful baryogenesis , dark matter or neutrino masses .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this model gives rise to a dark matter candidate , not because we have imposed a new symmetry ( local or global ) by hand which forbids their decays , but because the lagrangian in ( [ eqn : main_lag ] ) possesses an accidental @xmath18 symmetry ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 while @xmath21 ) .",
    "this @xmath18 symmetry will remain unbroken when @xmath16 is the vacuum solution .",
    "one might worry that higher loop corrections will introduce possible instabilities for the vacuum @xmath16 at very high energies when the `` negative '' running of the couplings changes the profile of potential @xmath9 . while this is a valid concern given that the term , @xmath22 in ( [ eqn : main_lag ] ) can lead to fermionic loops running in the higher order diagrams for the quartic couplings ,",
    "the situation can be placed under control with careful choices for the tree - level couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 for a given cut - off scale . in addition , observe that the quartic terms involving @xmath25 do not get such `` negative '' running at the one - loop level .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , we can assume @xmath25 to be unrestricted by the vacuum stability conditions .    with this setup , either @xmath2 or @xmath1 can play the role of the dark matter depending on which one has the smallest mass .",
    "our model building choice here is to make the lightest throughout the paper .",

    "it should be pointed out that , in reality , only the neutral component , @xmath28 , of the 5-plet can be the dark matter .",
    "this comes about because one - loop electroweak corrections will introduce a mass splitting between the different components of the multiplet which are otherwise mass degenerate at tree - level .",

    "this means that the component @xmath37 is about 166  mev heavier than the @xmath38 . as a consequence ,",
    "all the charged components of @xmath2 are unstable since processes like @xmath39 are kinematically accessible .",
    "similar mass splittings occur for the 6-plet scalar @xmath1 .",
    "but since we have already assumed @xmath27 , the exact mass spectrum of all its components will be inconsequential to our analysis here . for completeness though , and to display the connection to the parameters in ( [ eqn : v_s ] ) , we have listed the tree - level masses for the @xmath1 component fields after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) in appendix  [ app : chi_mass ] .    in the following sections",
    ", we will demonstrate that there is a consistent parameter space where this model of exotic multiplets can solve the problems of baryogenesis , dark matter and neutrino masses .",
    "in order to perform the analyzes for baryogenesis and neutrino masses later on , we must first compute the relevant parameters for our dark matter candidate , @xmath42 . in particular",
    ", we need to understand how the mass scale of @xmath26 ( and consequently , the lower bound on all other exotic particles in the model ) is constrained by cosmology .",
    "like other wimp models , the ability to reproduce the observed dm relic density is a crucial ingredient in determining whether the dm candidate under investigation is a viable one . assuming the standard thermal freeze - out of @xmath26 is solely responsible for the dm relic that we measure , @xmath43 @xcite , denotes the hubble constant in units of 100 km @xmath44 .",

    "furthermore , we will assume that these coannihilations happen predominantly via interactions mediated by sm gauge bosons .",

    "when the dust has settled , it is determined that the observed dm relic abundance can be explained if @xcite m_1 = 9.6 0.2 .",
    "this result is in line with the typical wimp type models where tev scale dm are predicted .",
    "the fact that the limit on @xmath47 turns out to be slightly bigger than the usual wimp reflects the extra coannihilation contributions the 5-plet @xmath26 ( with almost degenerate components ) is providing ) by a factor of about 2 as well @xcite . ] . note that any remaining charged components of @xmath26 will eventually decay away before nucleosynthesis ( due to their slightly higher mass ) with negligible entropy release .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although a dm mass of the size shown in ( [ eqn : m_1_mass ] ) can not be tested at the lhc , it has been shown in @xcite that such 5-plet dm may be within the reach of future dm direct detection experiments like supercdms @xcite and xenon-1 t @xcite .",
    "while baryogenesis remains an open problem with many candidate solutions , one popular way to tackle it is via leptogenesis , whereby a lepton asymmetry , @xmath65 , is first created by some @xmath66-violating processes operating in the early universe , and then partially converted to the required cosmic baryon asymmetry by non - perturbative electroweak sphaleron interactions .",
    "the classic scenario of leptogenesis @xcite ( and many subsequent extensions ) is based upon the type - i seesaw @xcite lagrangian where ( at least two ) rh electroweak singlet neutrinos , @xmath67 , are introduced to the lepton sector with yukawa couplings , @xmath68 . as a result , the heavy majorana @xmath67 can decay into @xmath69 during the primordial times and give rise to an excess in @xmath65 .",
    "a major advantage of this setup over many other baryogenesis models is that the type - i seesaw lagrangian automatically solves the light neutrino mass problem , providing a link ( albeit indirect ) between the parameters of neutrino physics and cosmology .",
    "other variations to the general scheme exist , and they provide interesting alternative solutions that can lead to other implications .    over the years , the sophistication in the quantitative analysis of leptogenesis has improved dramatically .",
    "most notably , the careful treatment of the different washout @xcite and its generalization to include flavor effects @xcite have been pivotal to the understanding of the workable parameter space for many interesting leptogenesis scenarios .",
    "one such scenario that is particularly relevant to our discussion here is the so - called `` @xmath70-leptogenesis '' @xcite , where the lepton asymmetry is predominantly produced by the decays of the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos ( rather than by the lightest one as in the conventional setup ) .",
    "we shall show that there is a strong resemblance between the model presented in this paper and the typical `` @xmath70-leptogenesis '' setup . as a result",
    ", the constraints on the leptogenesis parameter space for them will be markedly similar , which will ultimately allow us to construct an existence proof of successful leptogenesis for our exotic multiplet model .      to begin with ,",
    "let us recall that we have @xmath71  tev being established from the dark matter constraints in the previous section .",
    "therefore , in order for our 5-plet fermion , @xmath70 to be eligible for `` @xmath70-leptogenesis '' , we must now further assume that m_3 m_2 > m _",
    "hence , it will be natural for the decay , @xmath72 , to proceed via the yukawa term in lagrangian ( [ eqn : main_lag ] ) .",
    "note that at this temperature scale , the mass splittings of the component fields in the multiplets can be safely ignored and we will treat all components on an equal footing in our analysis .",
    "the choice of @xmath73 is for convenience , so that the decay and washout of @xmath74 may be treated separately from the @xmath70 stage ( or indeed , to a very good approximation ignored ) , as well as ensuring that the resulting cp asymmetry due to @xmath70 decays is not suppressed by @xmath75 for certain choices of parameters . at this point",

    "the normalization for this volume is such that in thermal equilibrium ( @xmath84 ) , there is @xmath85 particle for each component of @xmath70 .",
    "our prefactor of @xmath86 , which takes into account the dilution from sphaleron conversion and the expansion of the universe , differs ( very slightly ) from the @xmath87 by other authors because we have an increased number of relativistic degrees of freedom coming from the multiplets @xmath1 and @xmath88 .",
    "successful leptogenesis simply means that the result in ( [ eqn : etab_n_b - l ] ) must match the corresponding measured valued from wmap : @xmath89 @xcite . in the `` @xmath70-leptogenesis '' scenario ,",

    "an important observation here is that the light neutrino mass scale will be dependent on the size of @xmath190 , as well as the seesaw factors of @xmath191 .",

    "[ sec : model ] and thus it is essentially a free parameter . this fact will allow a very interesting situation where for a given @xmath8 scale , the size of the yukawas @xmath45 s can be large so that observable lepton flavor violating effects in processes such as @xmath192 and @xmath121-@xmath120 conversion in atomic nuclei are possible without spoiling the light neutrino mass predictions .",
    "a recent analysis on this point can be found in @xcite .",
    "the stage is now set for us to combine the results of the last three sections and explicitly show that there exists a parameter space for our exotic multiplet model to simultaneously solve the problems of dark matter , baryon asymmetry and neutrino masses .",
    "firstly , as far as the dark matter condition goes , the key constraint is coming from eq .",

    "provides further constraints on the dm parameter space ( albeit for @xmath23 and @xmath24 only which do not directly affect other sectors of the theory ) .",
    "however , since these are higher - order effects , we do not incorporate them in our analysis explicitly , and shall assume that they can be properly fine - tuned if required . ] note that all our subsequent discussions in the previous two sections were based on this assumption , therefore , our model will automatically satisfy the dm condition regardless of how we may choose the parameters in other sectors of the theory .    next , observe that ( [ eqn : n_decay_rate ] ) , ( [ eqn : eps_cp_main ] ) , ( [ eqn : flavor_proj_0 ] ) , ( [ eqn : projx0__wx ] ) and the definition for @xmath194 are the most important quantities which govern the leptogenesis sector , while ( [ eqn : numass_exp ] ) is the main result for neutrinos .",
    "the common features of all of them is that they are highly dependent on the yukawa matrix elements , @xmath6 and masses , @xmath195 .",
    "for the neutrino sector , @xmath190 is also essential .",
    "thus , the task is basically to select a set of @xmath196 and @xmath190 that can produce successful baryogenesis while giving realistic neutrino masses and mixing .    to see that there is a compatible set of choices , we begin by following condition ( [ eqn : mass_scale_set ] ) and take m_1 10 ^ 4 , m_10 ^ 7 , m_2 10 ^ 10 , m_3 10 ^ 13 . for the light neutrino sector , we pick the mass scale to be at @xmath197  ev ( normal or inverted hierarchy ) and @xmath198  ev ( quasi - degenerate ) . appealing to the best fit values from neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , @xmath199 one then has the following light neutrino mass spectra ( in ev ) : @xmath200 we shall use these numbers for our analysis below .      to begin with ,",
    "we take the spectrum of ( [ eqn : nh_spectrum ] ) and reverse the diagonalization procedure in ( [ eqn : numass_diag ] ) using ( [ eqn : nu_data_mixing ] ) as the inputs for @xmath189 ( ignoring the phases ) .",
    "so , we have for @xmath201 m_^ 10 ^ -20 ^-1 , where @xmath202  gev . to reproduce the entries in matrix ( [ eqn : m_nu_real_nh ] )",
    ", one must find a set of @xmath6 s such that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : numass_exp_approx ] ) is satisfied for the given exotic masses in ( [ eqn : mass_choices ] ) .",
    "but it is not hard to see that there are actually more parameters than constraints coming from matching ( [ eqn : numass_exp_approx ] ) with ( [ eqn : m_nu_real_nh ] ) .",
    "this extra parameter space freedom is crucial because the conditions for successful `` @xmath70-leptogenesis '' with flavor effects necessarily restrict the pattern of @xmath6 that one can choose .",
    "recall from earlier that flavor effect is the vital ingredient which opens up new parameter space for `` @xmath70-leptogenesis '' .",
    "it hinges on the fact that asymmetry produced in a certain flavor may evade ( sometimes completely ) the washout at the `` @xmath26 stage '' ( in our case , @xmath26 s role is played by 6-plet @xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , to ensure successful leptogenesis in our particular setup , we must control the size of the flavor projectors , @xmath203 and @xmath204 in ( [ eqn : flavor_proj_0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : projx0__wx ] ) respectively .",
    "this is usually done through the language of the flavored decay parameters @xmath205 and @xmath206 , which have an one - to - one correspondence with ( [ eqn : flavor_proj_0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : projx0__wx ] ) .    using the insights gained from some recent analyses of standard flavored leptogenesis @xcite",
    ", we will demand that the final lepton asymmetry is mainly due to the effects in the @xmath207 flavor . in other words ,",
    "we require @xmath208 to be relatively big so that during the production stage at @xmath106 , asymmetry @xmath209 can be effectively produced , also means a stronger @xmath207-washout at the production stage .",
    "but at the same time , a large @xmath210 ( meaning large @xmath150 ) allows more @xmath70 to be produced thermally .",
    "so , the interplay between decay and washout is rather convoluted and one must explicitly solve the evolution equations in order to get a real feeling of what is large or small enough . ]",
    "whereas at the @xmath1 washout stage , we need @xmath211 to be small so that the @xmath212 produced from the previous stage can largely avoid washout and survive to make up the observed baryon asymmetry .    with this in mind , we solve our set of constraint equations from ( [ eqn : m_nu_real_nh ] ) after setting k_z 65 , k_x 0.1 .",
    "note that these fix the magnitudes for @xmath213 and @xmath214 immediately after substituting in the value for @xmath215 and @xmath216 respectively .",
    "the hubble parameters themselves are determined by h(w ) 1.66 , where @xmath217 and @xmath218 for the @xmath215 case , while @xmath219 and @xmath220 for the @xmath216 case .",
    "gev is the planck mass .",
    "the rest of the @xmath6 entries may now be solved simultaneously , and one possible set of solutions for the complex yukawas is @xmath222 using these in the calculations as outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : lepto ] , one will eventually find that @xmath223 which agrees with the cmb data .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the inclusion of the nondiagonal flavor couplings @xmath140 and @xmath224 has increased the final asymmetry by about a factor of 2 in this particular example .",
    "one may repeat a similar analysis for the inverted hierarchical light neutrino spectrum of ( [ eqn : ih_spectrum ] ) . with the benefit of hindsight",
    ", we must choose a larger @xmath225 than before so that the resultant yukawa couplings , @xmath6 will at most be of .",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix in this case is m_^ 10 ^ -21 ^-1 .",
    "like before , we will restrict the @xmath207-flavor decay parameters to obey @xmath226 and @xmath211 .",
    "one suitable choice for this is k_z 2 , k_x 0.01 .",
    "subsequently , the yukawas may be chosen as @xmath227 this set of parameters will then lead to an asymmetry of @xmath228 , which means baryogenesis is marginally successful in this case .",
    "next , we address the case with quasi - degenerate mass spectrum depicted in ( [ eqn : qd_spectrum ] ) . again , in order to ensure that the sizes of the yukawas are within the perturbative regime , we pick @xmath225 .",
    "this gives m_^ 10 ^ -22 ^-1 .",
    "however , given this restriction on @xmath190 , it turns out that the resultant baryon asymmetry here is at best around @xmath229 .",
    "for example , if we impose k_z 1.2 , k_x 0.01 , and select @xmath230 then , the final baryon asymmetry is worked out to be @xmath231 , which is about an order of magnitude below the expected value . as a result ,",
    "this case is actually the least favored of the three within the specific scenario of leptogenesis discussed here .",
    "+ overall , it appears that a normal hierarchical light neutrino mass spectrum is the most natural choice .",
    "this is because during our parameter space search for successful leptogenesis ( given the theoretical errors ) , we have found more leeway when fitting the normal hierarchical case than the other two . however",
    ", this does not automatically imply that the inverted case is disfavored ( or the quasi - degenerate case is ruled out ) in general since we have assumed a very specific exotic mass spectrum of ( [ eqn : mass_choices ] ) . furthermore , our leptogenesis analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : lepto ] was based on a hierarchical mass spectrum with the special mass relations given in ( [ eqn : mass_scale_set ] ) , hence , there is a potentially larger parameter space that is viable for our model than suggested by our specific scenario shown in this paper .",
    "finally , we point out that when compared with standard leptogenesis , this model contains one extra type of field , namely the new 6-plet scalar @xmath1 , which then effectively gives rise to an additional tunable parameter ( @xmath190 ) when fitting the leptogenesis and neutrino parameters . but",
    "this increase in parameters and fields ( with no new symmetries imposed ) resulted in a model that also provides a dm candidate , something standard seesaw models do not automatically allow .",
    "thus , in a sense , this model is almost on a similar footing with standard seesaw as far as new input parameters beyond the sm versus new predictions that it generates . as a result",
    ", we believe it is a very interesting alternative solution for baryogenesis , dark matter and neutrino masses .",
    "in this work , we have analyzed an exotic multiplet model where three rh fermion 5-plets and one scalar 6-plet with quantum numbers @xmath232 and @xmath233 respectively are added to the minimal sm .",
    "such selection of new particles is motivated by the `` minimal dark matter '' idea @xcite where the dm candidate can be made stable in the relevant cosmological timescale without any extra symmetries ( local or global ) being imposed . for",
    "our particular setup where the lightest 5-plet particle ( @xmath42 ) is the dm , the sm gauge symmetries automatically forbid any unwanted interaction terms as long as the scalar potential is such that 6-plet @xmath1 does not develop a nonzero vev .",
    "the observed relic density then demands that such dm candidate must have a mass of around 10 tev .    with this in mind",
    ", we have subsequently demonstrated that , by tuning the mass spectrum of the exotic multiplets in the model , the correct baryon asymmetry may be generated via leptogenesis .",
    "specifically , when the masses are chosen as @xmath234  tev , this model possesses all the essential features from the standard `` @xmath70-leptogenesis '' scenario ( with flavor effects ) .",
    "so , it is quite natural for it to accommodate the requirements of successful baryogenesis .",
    "moreover , light neutrino masses for all types of hierarchy schemes can be generated radiatively via one - loop diagrams containing the multiplet particles . by adjusting the elements of the yukawa matrix , we have shown with concrete examples that all experimental neutrino mass and mixing parameters can be fitted .",
    "in addition , for most cases ( ie .",
    "hierarchical light neutrino spectra ) , these choices of parameters are fully compatible with the conditions for @xmath70-flavored leptogenesis , and hence , proving that this relatively modest extension of the sm can indeed simultaneously tackle the problems of baryon asymmetry , dark matter and neutrino masses .",

    "<S> we propose an extension to the standard model where three exotic fermion 5-plets and one scalar 6-plet are added to the particle content . by demanding that all interactions are renormalizable and standard model gauge invariant , we show that the lightest exotic particle in this model can be a dark matter candidate as long as the new 6-plet scalar does not develop a nonzero vacuum expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , light neutrino masses are generated radiatively at one - loop while the baryon asymmetry is produced by the cp - violating decays of the second lightest exotic particle . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated using concrete examples that there is a parameter space where a consistent solution to the problems of baryon asymmetry , dark matter and neutrino masses can be obtained . </S>"
