    "extensive photometric surveys , triggered by paczyski s suggestion ( 1986 ) , have led to the observation of microlensing effects towards the magellanic clouds ( eros , @xcite ; macho , @xcite ) and the galactic bulge ( ogle , @xcite ; macho , @xcite ) .",
    "the few hundred events observed towards the galactic centre ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have strengthened the hypothesis of a barred structure .",
    "the early suggestion of de vaucouleurs ( 1964 ) that the galaxy is barred is now supported by many other observations including photometric measurements ( @xcite ) , studies of gas ( @xcite ) , stellar kinematics ( @xcite ) and star counts ( @xcite ) . nevertheless , the bar parameters ( shape , size , mass ... ) are not yet precisely known .    in order to improve our knowledge of the galactic structure ,",
    "eros started a dedicated observation program towards the galactic spiral arms ( gsa ) in 1996 .",
    "four regions of the galactic plane located at large angles from the galactic centre are now being monitored to disentangle the disc , bar and halo contributions to the optical depths .",
    "three events with long einstein crossing time have already been published , based on two year ( 1996 - 97 ) eros observations ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "because of their long duration , they are more easily interpreted as lensing events due to disc objects , rather than to halo deflectors .",
    "we present in this paper an analysis of the three - year data set ( 1996 - 1998 ) .",
    "the telescope , camera and observations , as well as the operations and data reduction are described in paper i and references therein .",
    "four different directions are being monitored in the galactic plane , corresponding to a total of 29 fields with high stellar densities , covering a wide range of galactic longitude .",
    "the three year data set contains 9.1 million light curves : 2.1 towards @xmath1 , 1.8 towards @xmath2 , 3.0 towards @xmath3 and 2.2 towards @xmath4 .",
    "the observations span the period between july 1996 and november 1998 , except for @xmath4 which is being monitored only since january 1997 .",
    "an average of 100 measurements per field were obtained in each of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , which are close to cousins i and johnson r to @xmath7 magnitudes .",
    "as indicated in paper i , the distance distribution of our source stars is not precisely known .",
    "we adopt an average distance for source stars of @xmath8 kpc for the discussion presented in this paper .",
    "the data analysis is similar to that of the first two years , except that no rejection criteria based on the colour - magnitude diagram were applied .",
    "this was made possible by the longer time coverage , allowing a better rejection against variable stars .",
    "the first step of the event selection filter requires the presence of a single bump , simultaneous in the two eros colours . to reject ordinary variable stars , we use the combined @xmath9 of the microlensing fit from light curves in both colours , estimated outside the peak ( i.e. restricted to periods where the fitted magnification is lower than 10% ) .",
    "we retain high signal - to - noise ratio events by requiring a significant improvement of the microlensing fit ( ml ) over a constant flux fit ( cst ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "0    seven light curves satisfy all the requirements and are labelled gsa1 to 7 .",
    "[ analyse ] shows the distribution of @xmath12 versus @xmath13 for lightcurves satisfying all the other selection criteria .",
    "the seven candidates are located in a region of the diagram corresponding to lightcurves with a magnification well described by a microlensing fit and constant outside the peak .",
    "the upper right side of the diagram is populated by variable stars , mostly red and bright .",

    "we have applied them to monte - carlo generated light curves , obtained from a representative sample of the observed light curves on which we superimpose randomly generated microlensing effects .    .detection efficiency ( in % ) of the analysis as a function of the event timescale . [",

    "@xmath34  @xmath38 $ ] days . as in paper",
    "i , the analysis efficiency ( or sampling efficiency ) @xmath39 reported in table 2 is relative to a set of unblended stars , normalised to @xmath40 .",
    "we have computed the expected optical depth ( probability of observing a magnification larger than 1.34 for a pointlike source ) using a three component model for the deflectors  : a bulge , described by a barlike triaxial distribution , a thin disc , and a standard isotropic and isothermal halo ( same as model 1 in paper i ) .",
    "the expected optical depth averaged over the four directions is @xmath41 for this model .",
    "[ optvsl ] shows the optical depth up to @xmath42 as a function of galactic longitude for two values of the bar semi - major axis ( @xmath43 as in paper i and @xmath44 ) , at the average latitude of our fields @xmath45 .",
    "note that at this galactic latitude , the bulge and disc contributions are already reduced by a factor @xmath46 with respect to zero latitude ; moreover , the bulge contribution also changes dramatically with the distance to the target ( here assumed to be at 7 kpc , while the galactic centre is at 8.5 kpc ) .    assuming a standard halo completely made of compact objects would lead to a halo contribution of less than 10% to the gsa optical depth .",
    "moreover the eros measurements towards the lmc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the smc ( @xcite ) suggest that no more than 40% of this halo can be made of machos lighter than @xmath47 .",
    "thus , for the sake of clarity , we will neglect the halo contribution in the following discussion .",
    "[ duration ] shows the expected event duration distribution towards @xmath2 .",
    "the durations for the five events observed toward @xmath2 are also indicated .",
    "the predicted distribution is obtained using the kinematic characteristics and mass functions given in paper i. as the disc lenses have a low velocity relative to the line of sight , disc - disc events have longer timescales ( @xmath48  @xmath49 days ) than bar - disc events ( @xmath48  @xmath50 days ) .",
    "for a given target , an estimate of the optical depth or a limit ( when @xmath51 ) can be computed using the expression : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of monitored stars in the target and @xmath36 the duration of the search period ( 1170 days for this 3 year analysis , except 990 days towards @xmath4 ) .",
    "we compute an average optical depth @xmath54 by a weighted mean ( @xmath55 ) over the four directions .",
    "we find the value @xmath0 , in agreement with expectations . in fig .",
    "[ optvsl ] we report for each target the measured optical depth .",
    "the quoted errors include only poisson fluctuations and indicate the bayesian 68% confidence intervals . in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , where no events were observed , we have computed a 95% confidence level upper limit , assuming a mean event duration of 50 days  : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the two targets @xmath2 and @xmath3 are located at nearly symmetric longitudes with respect to the galactic centre . yet",
    ", we find an optical depth toward @xmath2 ( @xmath58 ) significantly higher ( at more than @xmath59 ) than toward @xmath3 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "in addition , the average measured event timescale toward @xmath2 is 40 days , half of that observed for @xmath3 .",
    "these features suggest a significant contribution from the bar toward @xmath2 .",
    "although an asymmetry is expected from the bar contribution in model i , our observations indicate a larger difference in optical depths .",
    "indeed we find a deficit in the event rate toward @xmath3 and an excess toward @xmath2 , compared to our model s predictions , as can be seen in figure 2 . provided that this is not due to a statistical fluctuation",
    ", at least two simple hypotheses could explain the observed asymmetry : + - an increase in the bar length parameter enhances the asymmetric contribution to the optical depth .",
    "changing this parameter from @xmath61 to @xmath62 kpc leads to an optical depth toward @xmath2 @xmath63 .",
    "+ - the optical depth is very sensitive to the poorly known distance distribution of the monitored source stars , which depends on the star number density and the extinction along the line of sight .",
    "for example , changing the @xmath2 source star distances from 7 kpc to 9 kpc ( resp 11 kpc ) increases the expected optical depth from @xmath64 to @xmath65 ( resp .",
    "@xmath66 ) .",
    "however , this hypothesis alone can not account for the shorter event durations observed toward @xmath2 .",
    "we have searched for microlensing events with durations ranging from a few days to a few months in four galactic disc zones lying at @xmath67 to @xmath68 from the galactic centre .",
    "we find seven events that can be interpreted as microlensing effects due to massive compact objects .",
    "the estimated average optical depth is compatible with expectations from simple galactic models .",
    "however , we observe variations of the event rate with the galactic longitude which differ from these models predictions .",
    "additional data is needed to confirm the reported discrepancy and to shed light on its interpretation .",
