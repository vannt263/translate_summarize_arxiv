    "several studies of single molecules of fluorescently labelled dna have been carried out in order to gain insight into the conformational evolution of polymer chains when subjected to a variety of flow fields  .",
    "these studies have not only enabled the direct visual observation of ` molecular individualism '  , but have also proved to be of vital importance for the validation of molecular theories of polymer dynamics  @xcite .",
    "nearly all these investigations have been carried out in either the dilute or concentrated solution regimes , with only a few in the semidilute regime  @xcite .",
    "given the importance of semidilute polymer solutions , both from a fundamental and a practical  @xcite point of view , it is essential to gain an understanding of the fundamental physics that govern the dynamics of polymer molecules in this regime . in the dilute regime ,",
    "single molecules studies have revealed the importance of properly accounting for hydrodynamic and excluded volume interactions in molecular theories  @xcite . in semidilute solutions , however , it is known that these interactions gradually get screened with increasing monomer concentration  @xcite .",
    "the recent single molecule experiments of hsiao _ et  al . _  on planar",
    "extensional flow of unentangled semidilute solutions of @xmath2-phage dna ( reported in a companion paper  @xcite ) , provide benchmark data against which molecular theories can be verified .",
    "in particular , one can examine if theories accurately capture the subtle changes that occur on the molecular scale , as chains begin to interact and interpenetrate with each other with increasing concentration .",
    "the aim of this paper is to carry out simulations with a recently developed multi - chain brownian dynamics algorithm  @xcite , which incorporates hydrodynamic and excluded volume interactions in order to compare predictions with experimental observations .",
    "additionally , the technique of successive fine - graining  @xcite is used to obtain predictions that are independent of model parameters .    over the past two decades , dna ( and in particular , @xmath2-phage dna ) has been used as model polymer to carry out a number of investigations into single molecule dynamics .",
    "the advantage of dna lies in the monodispersity of the solutions , and the ease with which the molecules can be stained with a dye for visual observation  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in dilute solutions , single molecule studies of dna have been used to examine the stretching dynamics of dna molecules in extensional flows  , stretching and tumbling dynamics in shear flows  @xcite , dynamics in mixed shear and extensional flows  @xcite , direct measurements of diffusion coefficients  @xcite and relaxation times  @xcite , and to establish the existence of coil - stretch hysteresis  @xcite . in concentrated solutions ,",
    "single molecule studies have established the validity of the reptation hypothesis  @xcite and of scaling theories for the molecular weight dependence of diffusion coefficients  @xcite .",
    "compared to the wealth of experimental information on single molecule dynamics in the dilute and concentrated regimes , there is comparatively little information on the behavior of macromolecules in the semidilute regime , both under equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions . the classic early work of chu and co - workers  @xcite was the first attempt to relate macroscopic rheological behavior to microscopic dynamics in shear flows .",
    "steinberg and co - workers have measured the longest relaxation times for semidilute solutions of t4 dna by carrying out stretch relaxation experiments  @xcite . more recently , bausch and co - workers  @xcite have correlated the dynamics of semiflexible polymers in semidilute solutions to the measured dependence of viscosity on shear rate . to our knowledge , there appear to be no measurements of single molecule dynamics in extensional flows of unentangled semidilute solutions , prior to the recent work of hsiao _",
    "et  al . _",
    "it is also worth noting that experiments on single molecule behavior in extensional flows of dilute solutions have either separately examined the unravelling of chains from the coiled to the stretched state  , or the relaxation from the stretched to the coiled state  @xcite .",
    "the experiments of hsiao _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite are unique in that they document the response of single chains to step - strain deformation followed by cessation of flow , both in the dilute and semidilute regime , and provide an opportunity to validate simulation predictions of chain stretch and relaxation in a single experiment .    in the case of dilute polymer solutions undergoing extensional flow ,",
    "several studies have shown that it is necessary to incorporate the finite extensibility of chains , and the presence of hydrodynamic and excluded volume interactions into molecular theories in order to obtain an accurate prediction of experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "in addition to having to choose the level of coarse - graining through a choice of the number of beads in a bead - spring chain , @xmath0 , the incorporation of these phenomena entails the choice of parameters associated with each of them when carrying out simulations .",
    "thus a choice needs to be made for the values of the nondimensional finite extensibility parameter , @xmath3 , the nondimensional bead radius , @xmath4 , which is a measure of the strength of hydrodynamic interactions , and the nondimensional excluded volume parameter , @xmath5 , which is a measure of the difference between the solution temperature and the theta temperature .",
    "prakash and co - workers  @xcite have shown that by using the method of successive fine - graining , predictions can be obtained that are independent of the choice of parameters in the model .",
    "the successive fine - graining technique is a specific protocol by which simulation data acquired for bead - spring chains with increasing values of @xmath0 , is extrapolated to the number of kuhn steps @xmath6 in the polymer chain being simulated .",
    "it essentially exploits the universal behavior observed in solutions of long chain polymers , to obtain parameter free simulation predictions . in dilute solutions",
    ", the use of successive fine - graining has been shown to lead to quantitatively accurate predictions of the conformational evolution of @xmath2-phage dna in cross - slot cells  @xcite and the extensional viscosity of both dna  @xcite and polystyrene solutions  @xcite in uniaxial extensional flows .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to use the successive fine - graining technique to predict the conformational evolution of dna molecules in unentangled semidilute solutions when subjected to step - strain deformation followed by cessation of flow , and to verify if accurate predictions of the experimental measurements of hsiao _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite can be obtained .",
    "several different mesoscopic simulation techniques have been developed over the past decade for describing the dynamics of unentangled semidilute polymer solutions which take into account the presence of intra and intermolecular long - range hydrodynamic interactions  @xcite . by implementing the kraynik - reinelt periodic boundary conditions for mixed flows  @xcite , prakash and co - workers  @xcite",
    "have recently developed an optimized multi - particle brownian dynamics algorithm that can simulate arbitrary planar mixed shear and extensional flows of polymer solutions at finite concentrations .",
    "this algorithm is used in the present work to implement the successive fine - graining technique in the context of planar extensional flows .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ numdetails ] and in the supplementary material , the governing equations for a bead - spring chain model are given along with the definitions of various observable quantities . in section  [ sfg ] , a brief overview of the successive fine - graining technique is presented .",
    "a detailed comparison of simulation predictions with the experimental observations of  @xcite , in dilute and in semidilute solutions , is presented in section  [ results ] . in particular",
    ", we carry out a qualitative comparison of the probability distribution of fractional stretch in planar extensional flows , and a quantitative comparison of the conformational evolution of individual chains subjected to a step - strain deformation followed by cessation of flow .",
    "a discussion of the reasons why the successive fine graining scheme may be expected to work , and the conditions under which it breaks down are discussed in section  [ blobology ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclu ] , we summarise the principal conclusions of this work .",
    "a coarse - grained bead - spring chain model is used to represent dna molecules , with each chain consisting of a sequence of @xmath0 beads ( which act as centers of hydrodynamic resistance ) connected by @xmath7 massless wormlike chain ( wlc ) springs that represent the entropic force between two adjacent beads . a semidilute solution of dna molecules",
    "is obtained by immersing an ensemble of @xmath8 such bead - spring chains in an incompressible newtonian solvent .",
    "the bulk monomer concentration of the solution is defined by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is total number of beads per cubic simulation cell of edge length @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , is the volume of each periodic cell .",
    "as detailed in the supplementary material , the inter and intramolecular hydrodynamic interactions between the beads are modeled using the rotne - prager - yamakawa ( rpy ) tensor , while bead overlap is prevented by using a pairwise repulsive narrow gaussian excluded volume potential . for the purpose of non - dimensionalising length and time units , a length scale @xmath13 and a time scale @xmath14",
    "are used respectively , where @xmath15 is the temperature , @xmath16 is the spring constant , @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath18 is the hydrodynamic friction coefficient associated with a bead . within this framework , the time evolution of the dimensionless position , @xmath19 of a typical bead @xmath20 , is governed by a stochastic differential equation , which can be numerically integrated with the help of brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "the specifics of the integration scheme , along with details of the simulation protocol , and the particular forms of the spring force and the hydrodynamic interaction tensor used here , are given in the supplementary material .",
    "dna solutions used in rheological measurements are typically buffered aqueous solutions with an excess concentration of sodium salt , which has been established to be well above the threshold for observing charge - screening effects ( see appendix  b of  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , dna molecules are expected to behave identically to neutral molecules in good solvents that lie in the crossover regime between @xmath21 solutions and athermal solvents , with the solvent quality described by the variable  @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the molecular weight , @xmath24 is the theta temperature , and @xmath25 is a polymer - solvent chemistry dependent constant .",
    "recently , pan _",

    "is estimated to have a solvent quality @xmath28 at 22@xmath29  ( the temperature at which the experiments reported in hsiao",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "@xcite have been carried out ) .",
    "interestingly , sunthar _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite found that using @xmath30 ( rather than @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) in their dilute solution simulations gave the best agreement between predictions and the experimental measurements of  @xcite . at equilibrium ,",
    "experiments and simulations show that for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , while at @xmath35 ( these estimates can be obtained from eqn .",
    "23 of ref .",
    "@xcite which gives a formula for @xmath36 as a function of @xmath27 that fits both experimental and simulation data ) .",
    "the difference in equilibrium chain swelling between the two values of @xmath27 is consequently less than 5% , which is not significant in comparison to experimental and simulation error bars .",
    "anticipating , therefore , that the difference between results for these two values of @xmath27 will not be significant , we have used a value of @xmath30 in all our simulations . however , in order to ensure that this is in fact the case , we have validated this assumption by carrying out simulations with @xmath33 , at one value of the weissenberg number ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the results of the study , which are presented in the supplementary material , show that indeed this assumption is justified .",
    "the solvent quality can be conveniently controlled in simulations with the help of the narrow gaussian potential  @xcite @xmath38 which determines the force due to excluded volume interactions between any two beads @xmath39 and @xmath20 . here , @xmath5 is the strength of the excluded volume interactions , and @xmath40 is the range of the interaction .",
    "a mapping between experiments and simulations is achieved by setting @xmath41 , with @xmath5 being a measure of the departure from the @xmath21-temperature , and @xmath0 being proportional to the molecular weight  @xcite . as a result , for any choice of @xmath0 , @xmath5",
    "is chosen to be equal to @xmath42 such that the simulations correspond to the given experimental value of @xmath27 . for reasons elaborated in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of dilute polymer solutions , the parameter @xmath40 is irrelevant for sufficiently long chains , and is typically calculated by the expression @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being an arbitrary constant .",
    "it is worth noting that in order to establish that simulation predictions obtained with the successive fine - graining protocol are truly parameter free , it is necessary to demonstrate independence from the choice of the constant @xmath44 in addition to the other model parameters discussed earlier . in the present instance",
    ", the influence of @xmath44 on simulation predictions is examined in the supplementary material , and shown to be irrelevant as expected .    a majority of the experimental measurements by  @xcite in the semidilute regime",
    "have been carried out at the scaled concentration @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the overlap concentration , which is defined here by the expression , @xmath47 $ ] , with @xmath48 being the radius of gyration for an isolated chain at equilibrium .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is calculated for each simulation reported here by computing @xmath48 a  priori from single - chain bd simulations at equilibrium , for the relevant set of parameter values .",
    "the velocity gradient tensor for planar extensional flows is given by  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the elongation rate .",
    "planar extensional flows are generally difficult to study by computer simulations , since fluid elements are exponentially stretched in one direction and contracted in the perpendicular direction .",
    "this leads to a very short window of time to observe the dynamics of single molecules since the dimensions of the simulation box rapidly become of order of intermolecular distance .",
    "this difficulty can be resolved by the implementation of kraynik - reinelt periodic boundary conditions  @xcite . as mentioned earlier , jain _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite have implemented these boundary conditions for bd simulations in the context of arbitrary planar mixed flows , and this algorithm has been adopted here .",
    "simulation predictions are compared with the experimentally measured _",
    "stretch _ of molecules , when a semidilute solution is subjected to a step - strain deformation in a planar extensional flow",
    ". the stretch of a fluorescently dyed dna molecule , measured in a cross - slot cell , is the projected extent of the molecule in the flow direction . for a bead - spring chain model ,",
    "this is calculated from , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath54-component of the vector @xmath55 of bead @xmath39 , with @xmath54 being the direction of flow .",
    "the mean stretch can be obtained from the bead positions in an ensemble of chain configurations from the ensemble average , @xmath56 the equilibrium mean stretch is denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "experimental measurements of stretch are typically reported in terms of the nondimensional ratio @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the contour length of stained @xmath2-phage dna molecules , typically assumed to be equal to 22 @xmath39 m .",
    "however , we often find it convenient to additionally use the expansion ratio , @xmath60 in simulations .",
    "the longest relaxation time @xmath61 is measured experimentally by fitting the terminal 30@xmath62 of the stretch of a molecule , as it relaxes from a highly extended state , with a single exponential decay  @xcite . in simulations , the longest dimensionless relaxation time @xmath63 , for any bead - spring chain with @xmath0 beads ,",
    "is obtained by initially stretching each chain to nearly 90@xmath62 of its fully extended state , and letting it relax to equilibrium .",
    "details of this procedure are presented in the supplementary material .",
    "the successive fine - graining technique exploits the universal behavior of polymer solutions to obtain property predictions that are independent of the choice of model parameters . at equilibrium , this technique has been widely used to obtain universal predictions from analytical theories and molecular simulations  @xcite .",
    "essentially , data is accumulated for finite chains , and subsequently extrapolated to the long chain limit , @xmath64 , where the self - similar character of polymer chains is captured .",
    "extrapolation to the long chain limit has also been used to obtain universal predictions in shear flow , where the finiteness of chain length is not relevant for sufficiently long chains at typically measured shear rates  @xcite . in extensional flows",
    ", however , where at high extension rates chains are nearly fully stretched , the finiteness of chain length plays a crucial role in determining the solution s properties . even under these circumstances , provided the flow has not ` penetrated ' below the pincus blob length scale , universal behavior is still observed  @xcite ( see also discussion in section  [ blobology ] ) .",
    "prakash and co - workers have modified the successive fine - graining technique for infinitely long chains , by making it applicable under conditions where it is important to account for the finite length of a chain  @xcite . while at its core , the modification consists of changing the extrapolation limit from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , where @xmath6 is the number of kuhn steps in the underlying chain , the details of the method are more subtle and complex .",
    "sunthar and prakash have discussed the procedure in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of completeness , and since it is used in the context of semidilute solutions here for the first time , we briefly motivate and explain the salient features of the technique below .",
    "an example of a universal equilibrium property for dilute polymer solutions under @xmath21 conditions is the flory - fox constant @xmath66 , defined by  @xcite , @xmath67_{\\theta}m}{\\left({4 \\pi}/{3 } \\right ) { \\left(r_{g}^{\\theta}\\right)}^3 n_{a}}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the radius of gyration , @xmath69_\\theta$ ] is the zero shear rate intrinsic viscosity , and @xmath70 is avagadro s constant .",
    "it is a surprising experimental observation that @xmath66 attains its universal value of @xmath71 for a wide range of polymer - solvent systems  @xcite , for molecular weights as low as @xmath72 g / mol  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "it is clear that the intrinsic viscosity at the @xmath21 temperature for a majority of dilute solutions of linear flexible polymers can be calculated once the radius of gyration of the polymer under @xmath21 conditions is known . for polymer solutions in the crossover region between @xmath21 and very good solvents , an additional variable , namely the solvent quality parameter @xmath27 is required to describe universal behavior .",
    "for instance , for a number of different polymer - solvent systems , the ratio , @xmath73}{[\\eta]_{\\theta}}\\right)^{1/3}\\ ] ] measured at different temperatures and molecular weights , is found to collapse onto a master plot , when plotted as a function of @xmath27  @xcite . since , @xmath74(t , m )   = [ \\eta]_{\\theta } \\ , \\alpha_\\eta^{3 }                 = u_{\\eta r}^{\\theta } \\left ( \\frac{n_{a}}{m}\\right ) \\left ( \\frac{4 \\pi}{3 } r_{g}^{\\theta}\\right)^{3 } \\left[\\alpha_{\\eta } ( z ) \\right]^{3}\\ ] ] it is clear that a knowledge of @xmath75 , and the universal properties @xmath76 and @xmath77 , enables the determination of the intrinsic viscosity of any dilute linear polymer - solvent system in the crossover regime .",
    "a similar argument can be made for any other static or dynamic property of a dilute polymer solution , @xmath78 . essentially , provided one knows a suitably defined universal ratio @xmath79 under @xmath21 conditions , and the universal crossover swelling function @xmath80",
    ", the property @xmath81 can be determined for the solution at any temperature and polymer molecular weight , given @xmath75 and @xmath27 .",
    "this is the basic content of the two - parameter theory  @xcite , which states that all static and dynamic properties of a dilute solution of linear flexible polymers can be determined once @xmath75 and @xmath27 are known .",
    "bead - spring chain models with hookean springs need three parameters @xmath82 , to be specified , when nondimensionalized with the length scale @xmath83 , and time scale @xmath84 . while the strength of hydrodynamic interactions is specified by the draining parameter  @xcite , @xmath85 , the strength of excluded volume interactions  @xcite",
    "is determined by @xmath86 .",
    "typically , the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath27 are kept constant when implementing the successive fine - graining procedure of extrapolating finite chain data to the long chain limit , @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "this implies that universal property predictions at equilibrium and in shear flow are obtained in the non - draining limit @xmath88 ( independent of the particular choice made for @xmath4 ) , and at a specific location in the crossover regime specified by the solvent quality @xmath27 .",
    "the modified successive fine - graining procedure for polymer solutions in extensional flows  @xcite also leads to universal predictions in the limit of large @xmath89 and constant @xmath27 .",
    "however , the use of finitely extensible springs in place of hookean springs , in order to account for finite chain length , leads to significant changes in the implementation of the procedure .",
    "when subjected to extensional flow , a dilute polymer solution in the crossover regime is characterized by the following set of variables : @xmath90 . here",
    ", @xmath59 is the finite contour length of the chain , @xmath91 is the weissenberg number , with @xmath92 being the extension rate , and @xmath93 the hencky strain , which measures the extent of deformation from the onset of flow .",

    "( a ) if @xmath234 is the number of correlation blobs in a pincus blob , then @xmath235 , and the rouse relaxation time is @xmath236 . since the flow penetrates a pincus blob when @xmath186 , @xmath238 from the scaling expressions for the rouse relaxation time and the mean equilibrium size of the chain in terms of the number of correlation blobs , it follows that @xmath242 the size of the pincus blob is consequently given by @xmath285 since the chain obeys rw statistics on all length scales , @xmath286 as a result , the pincus blob size becomes equal to the size of the thermal blob when @xmath287 ( b ) in this case as well , using arguments similar to those above , one can show that @xmath285 in this concentration regime  @xcite , @xmath288 as a result , since @xmath289 , it follows that the pincus and correlation blobs become equal in size at a critical weissenberg number given by @xmath290 ( c ) since zimm dynamics are obeyed below @xmath220 , we have @xmath199 , and the zimm relaxation time of the pincus blob is @xmath200 .",
