    "motivated by the success of cold atomic physics , recently , there has been a growing interest in producing cold and ultracold molecules in molecular physics @xcite .",
    "cold molecules could be produced by sympathetic cooling @xcite or deceleration of supersonic beams @xcite .",
    "these methods are general ; however , it is still hard to attain ultracold molecules(@xmath11mk ) . despite the difficulty of directly cooling molecules , numerous experimental efforts have been made to generate ultracold alkali molecules through associating ultracold atoms implying the feshbach resonance @xcite or photoassociation @xcite techniques . in general , the ultracold molecules created by these two approaches are distributed in various excited states . over the last few years ,",
    "a lot of theoretical and experimental investigations have demonstrated , via the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) technique @xcite , that excited ultracold molecules could be transferred to molecular ground states @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the stirap technique applies two specially designed sequential laser pulses to produce a coherent population trapping ( cpt ) state for the purpose of realizing a complete population transfer between two quantum states of an atom or a molecule @xcite . in stirap experiments , when two pulsed lasers interact with an atom or a molecule , the corresponding hamiltonian for the atom or molecule is time dependent .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations for the stirap have shown that it is critical to keep the atomic or molecular system adiabatically staying in the instantaneous cpt eigenstate of the time - dependent hamiltonian @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , any dynamical deviations from the cpt state must be small enough to achieve a good stirap .",
    "in photoassociation of ultracold molecules combined with stirap , the adiabaticity analysis of the cpt state gets more complicated , because the physical process of atom - molecule transfer is intrinsically nonlinear .",
    "two nonlinear resources exist .",
    "one is due to merging of two atoms , and the other arises from collisions between atoms and molecules .",
    "the nonlinearity could make the system unstable , such that a small deviation from the cpt state might be amplified , and consequently the transfer efficiency from atoms to molecules will be decreased @xcite .",
    "so adiabaticity and stability are crucial for achieving an efficient molecular generation .",
    "ignoring collisional interactions between atoms and molecules , adiabatic conditions for the cpt state in photoassociation process have been intensively investigated @xcite-@xcite ; in particular , reference @xcite presents a general approach to treat the adiabatic condition through a linearization procedure . however , these investigations neglect the effect of nonlinear instability caused by collisional interactions between atoms and molecules @xcite . quite recently , references.@xcite extend the approach in @xcite including dynamical instabilities , and obtain improved adiabatic conditions .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of applying stirap to photoassociate molecules from an atomic condensate .",
    "we emphasize the relations between dynamical instability aroused from intra - atomic collision , the adiabatic condition of a cpt state and the transfer efficiency from atoms to molecules .",
    "we obtain an analytical formula for a cpt state including the atom - atom collisional effect and obtain the collision - induced frequency shift between two quantum states .",
    "further , even in dynamically unstable regimes , we find that the adiabatic realization of the cpt state is available , and a very efficient atom - molecule transfer could be achieved when the single - photon detuning can compensate the collision - induced frequency shift .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present a two - color @xmath2-type model in the mean - field treatment and study the stability and adiabaticity properties for the corresponding cpt state . in particular , we derive an analytical form for the adiabatic condition in the case of effective single - photon resonance . in section 3 , we numerically test our theoretical results and discuss the experimental feasibility .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in section 4 .",
    "model.eps    our scheme of photoassociating molecules applies a two - color @xmath2-type configuration @xcite as shown in figure [ model ] .",
    "first , a pair of ultracold atoms initially occupied in the ground state @xmath3 is associated with and excited to a molecular state @xmath4 via a pump laser with a one - photon detuning @xmath5 from the state @xmath4 .",
    "subsequently , another control laser with a detuning @xmath5+@xmath6 ( @xmath6 , the two - photon detuning ) from the molecular excited state @xmath4 takes the excited molecules to the molecular ground state @xmath7 .",
    "the rabi frequencies by the two lasers , respectively denoted as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are treated as real numbers in our following discussions .    in the interaction picture ,",
    "the hamiltonian for the atom - molecule system is given by @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the annihilation(creation ) field operators for the state @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "in equation ( [ hamn ] ) , @xmath14 with @xmath15-wave scattering length @xmath16 is the pseudo - potential for the atom - atom interaction .",
    "atom - molecule and molecule - molecule interactions are ignored for the purpose of extracting physics induced by two - body @xmath15-wave collisions .",
    "actually , our later numerical simulations show that by adding the neglected collisional effects , our main results will not change .    in our analysis , we are concerned with a spatially uniform system at zero - temperature , and",
    "thus the kinetic and trapping potential terms within equation ( [ hamn ] ) have been safely removed . using the mean - field method that replace @xmath17 with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the density of the total particle number , from equation ( [ hamn ] )",
    ", we obtain a set of coupled heisenberg motional equations for @xmath20 , given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is introduced phenomenologically for describing the spontaneous emission of the excited state @xmath4 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    without an intra - atomic collisional term in equation ( [ dy1 ] ) ,",
    "a cpt state has already been obtained @xcite .",
    "now , including the collision , how the cpt state is modified is worthy of investigating @xcite . to obtain a cpt state including intra - atomic collisional effect , we assume @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the chemical potential and @xmath29 are for population distributions in the cpt state .",
    "we also neglect the spontaneous loss @xmath22 and treat all the other parameters as time - independent . inserting the ansatz for the cpt state into equations ( [ dy1])-([dy3 ] ) and considering the total particle number normalization , @xmath30 , we obtain the population distributions given by a new vector @xmath31^{t}$ ] , where @xmath32 under the condition of an effective two - photon resonance @xmath33 with @xmath34 . here , @xmath35 is the collision - induced frequency shift .",
    "the chemical potential corresponding to equation ( [ dark_popu ] ) is @xmath36 .",
    "equation([dark_popu ] ) shows that all the atoms @xmath37 could be converted into ground - state molecules @xmath38 under the two - photon resonance when @xmath39 approaches to @xmath40 .",
    "more interestingly , equation ( [ dark_popu ] ) indicates that when @xmath41 is satisfied , the cpt state does not rely on the @xmath42 coefficient .",
    "in contrast , previous works on other models for photoassociating molecules shows that the atom - atom collision could easily lead to the deviation of the system from a cpt state , and thus the final produce of molecules in the ground state could be low @xcite .      in section [ cpt distributions ] , we have derived a cpt state with atom - atom collision .",
    "however , this collision could lead to dynamical instability of the atom - molecule coupled system .",
    "in this situation , whether the cpt state could be adiabatically followed is worthy of further exploring . in this section ,",
    "we start to investigate an adiabatic theory for the cpt state .",

    "are two controllable parameters .",

    "we turn our attention to eigenstates of the matrix @xmath97 .",
    "the eigenstate with @xmath74 corresponding to the goldstone mode takes a non - normalized form of@xmath98    since the goldstone mode is degenerate , we need to introduce a new vector @xmath99 complimentary to @xmath100 given by@xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102  is determined from a normalization condition @xmath103 and @xmath104 is given in equation ( [ eta_pm ] ) . by solving equations ( [ mq_eq ] ) and ( [ normalized ] ) simultaneously , we find @xmath99 has the following structure:@xmath105 where elements @xmath106 are@xmath107 and the coefficient @xmath69 is @xmath108 .",

    "actually , figure [ adiabaticity_pic ] also shows that when @xmath203mhz , @xmath141 is much smaller than 0.1 , very good adiabaticity and a high atom - molecule transfer efficiency could be obtained .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the atom - molecule transfer within a @xmath2-type configuration including atom - atom collision .",
    "we first obtain a cpt state including the atom - atom collisional effect under the effective two - photon resonance condition and find the collision induced frequency shift between two quantum states .",
    "further , we study the stability and adiabaticity of the cpt state .",
    "we find that instability could be essentially induced when the pump and control lasers overlap and thus when the overlapping time of the pump and control lasers is short so that the unstable growth of the deviation from the cpt state could be neglected , good adiabaticity of the cpt state can be obtained in some unstable regions , not just in stable ones .",
    "employing the effective single photon resonance , our numerical simulations show that a rather high atom - molecule transfer efficiency ( @xmath18380@xmath182 ) could be achieved .",
    "finally , the feasibility of our scheme for future experiments is discussed .",
    "our findings may provide a new way to efficiently photoassociate ground state molecules from a cold atomic gas with strong atom - atom collisional interaction .",
