    "the category of compact hausdorff topological spaces is probably the most convenient topological category for a categorical topologist .",

    "many classical construction on topological spaces lead to covariant functors in the category of compacta , and categorical methods proved to be efficient tools to study hyperspaces , spaces of measures , symmetric products etc  @xcite .",
    "we can mention the hyperspace functor @xmath0  @xcite , the inclusion hyperspace functor @xmath1  @xcite , the probability measure functor @xmath2  @xcite , and the capacity functor @xmath3 which was recently introduced by zarichnyi and nykyforchyn @xcite to study non - additive regular measures on compacta .",
    "functors @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 have rather good properties . the functors @xmath0 and @xmath2 belong to a defined by epin class of normal functors , while @xmath1 and @xmath3 satisfy all requirements of normality but preservation of preimages , hence are only weakly normal . they are functorial parts of monads  @xcite .    unfortunately the functors @xmath0 and @xmath1 lose most of their nice properties when they are extended from the category of compacta to the category of tychonoff spaces .",
    "moreover , a  meaningful extension usually is not unique .",
    "an interested reader is referred , e.g. to @xcite , where _ four _ extensions to the category of tychonoff spaces of the probability measure functor @xmath2 are discussed , and two of them are investigated in detail .",
    "the aim of this paper is extend the inclusion hyperspace functor , the capacity functor and monads for these functors from the category of compacta to the category of tychonoff spaces , and to study properties of these extensions .",
    "we will use `` fine tuning '' of standard definitions of hyperspaces and inclusion hyperspaces to `` save '' as much topological and categorical properties valid for the compact case as possible .",
