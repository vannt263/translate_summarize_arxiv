    "the intense international activity involved in probing the structure of matter on all scales , with particle beams and radiation , owes much to recent advances in accelerator science and technology .",
    "developments in the production of high power laser radiation also offer new avenues for accelerator design and new diagnostic tools of relevance to medical science , engineering and the communications industry .",
    "a common theme in these developments is the interaction between charged particles and the electromagnetic field in domains where relativistic effects can not be ignored .",
    "it is remarkable that many of the challenges that must be addressed in order to develop and control devices that accelerate charged particles have their origin in the interaction of particles with their _ own electromagnetic field_. despite the fact that the classical laws of electromagnetism were essentially formulated over a century and a half ago the subject of electromagnetic interactions with matter remains incomplete .",
    "this incompleteness has had concomitant effects on the development of quantum electrodynamics and renormalisation theory . at root ,",
    "the difficulties reside in the recognition that the quantum structure of matter at some scale is beyond observation . furthermore , the classical description of the electron as a point particle leads to singularities in the maxwell self - fields that inevitably create ambiguities in its interaction with the maxwell field .",
    "the general consensus is that a useful domain of validity of the lorentz - dirac equation  @xcite , describing covariantly the radiation reaction on a point electron , can be accommodated by performing areduction of order \" that effectively replaces the equation by a perturbative second order system for the particle world line .",
    "one must then decide whether higher order terms in this expansion should be maintained given the neglect of terms associated with the regularisation scheme .",
    "this approach is behind many of the successful applications of approximate radiation reaction dynamics , despite the somewhat delicate and unsatisfactory nature of the arguments that purport to support this approach .",
    "it appears that the analysis of systems involving radiating matter has progressed by a very successful symbiosis between experimental expediency and a variety of approximation schemes with proven effectiveness in different domains of validity .",
    "however , as schemes for accelerating charged particles in these devices become more complex and ambitious in their aims it is apparent that some existing theoretical models are inadequate for a proper understanding of new challenges .",
    "such models are sometimes enshrined in large commercial computer codes that do not survive scientific scrutiny or have documentation that makes contact with established scientific literature difficult .",
    "as particle energies increase with the use of higher intensity laser fields this issue becomes critical and more reliable methods for accommodating radiation reaction must be found .",
    "a mathematically coherent formulation of a closed system of partial differential equations describing the relativistic behaviour of charged matter with electromagnetic fields is inevitably non - linear and , in general , exact solutions satisfying causal boundary conditions are intractable .",
    "the fact that the effects of ( coherent and incoherent ) radiation on micrometre - sized charged bunches in a host of newly proposed advanced devices is a significant barrier to development indicates that existing approaches used to model such effects are inadequate and that a new look at the whole problem is timely .",
    "many of the radiation problems alluded to above can be circumvented by working _ entirely in the language of fields _ rather than both particles and fields .",
    "this makes it possible to use intrinsic tensor field theory and exploit to the full the power of differential geometry in a relativistic spacetime framework .",
    "the geometric field formulation offers a number of powerful computational advantages over existing formulations of beam dynamics .",
    "these include the maintenance of relativistic covariance ( local lorentz transformation between local ( accelerating ) frames are unnecessary ) , the use of curvilinear coordinates adapted to the geometry of particular problems ( thereby facilitating imposition of boundary conditions ) , exploitation of available symmetries and the formulation of coordinate - independent approximation schemes .    in this article",
    "a new approach is offered for analysing the behaviour of distributions of charged particles in a coupled electromagnetic field environment .",
    "guided by a simple model , an approximation scheme designed for charged distributions containing _ ultra - relativistic _ particles .",
    "] is explored .",
    "the exact equations of motion are derived from the vanishing divergence of a relativistic stress - energy tensor for matter and radiation . before presenting the approximation scheme in detail",
    "we recall the genesis of the radiation reaction for a _ point _",

    "continuum_.      p    # 1@xmath0    in this paper the language of differential geometry is employed since it offers the most succinct mathematical framework for electrodynamics .",
    "thus , all fields will be regarded as sections of tensor bundles over appropriate domains @xmath1 of minkowski spacetime endowed with a fixed metric @xmath2 and a torsion - free metric compatible connection @xmath3 .",
    "sections of the tangent bundle over @xmath1 will be denoted @xmath4 while sections of the bundle of exterior @xmath5-forms will be denoted @xmath6 . for any vector field @xmath7",
    "denote by @xmath8 the associated @xmath9-form defined by @xmath10 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 will denote the exterior derivative and @xmath12 the contraction operator with respect to @xmath7 . to facilitate comparisons with existing accounts of beam dynamics appendix [",
    "appendix : gibbs_3-vector_version ] translates the tensor formulation of the perturbation scheme into the @xmath13-vector language involving electric and magnetic fields observed in a laboratory ( inertial ) frame .",
    "due to its high symmetry , minkowski spacetime admits a class of global charts that play a fundamental role in the following .",
    "a generic system of coordinates in one of these charts will be denoted @xmath14 where @xmath15 ranges from @xmath16 to @xmath13 . in these coordinates the metric tensor takes the form with @xmath17 the field @xmath18 is defined to be future - pointing . when convenient @xmath19 is written and the vacuum speed of light @xmath20 is set to @xmath9 .",
    "the significance of this class of coordinates is that it offers a basis of symmetry generators @xmath21 : where @xmath22 is the lie derivative with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "such killing vectors will be used to define energy - momentum densities and power - momentum fluxes associated with different field configurations on spacetime .    if @xmath23 is a domain of spacetime with boundary for space - like hypersurfaces @xmath24 and @xmath25 a closed regular 3-form on @xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath26 ) then thus such closed 3-forms imply conservation laws .    in a vacuum the electric and magnetic fields",
    "are encoded into the @xmath27-form @xmath28 and the electric charge density and current are described by a source current 3-form @xmath29 .",
    "the maxwell field system on spacetime is and where @xmath30 is the hodge map associated with the spacetime metric tensor @xmath2 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the permittivity of the vacuum .    for any vector field @xmath33 on spacetime and any maxwell solution @xmath28 define the `` electromagnetic drive '' 3-form",
    "if @xmath33 is a killing vector field then @xmath34 is called a `` killing current '' and follows from ( [ maxeq1 ] ) , ( [ maxeq2 ] ) and ( [ em_stress_forms ] ) . for each killing vector field these equations establish a local conservation equation ( @xmath35 ) in a source free region @xmath36 .",

    "more precisely @xmath42 is the field energy associated with the space - like 3-chain @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the power flux across an oriented space - like 2-chain @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath7 is a space - like killing vector generating space - like translations along open integral curves then with the split : where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the maxwell stress 2-form @xmath48 may be used to identify mechanical forces produced by a flow of field momentum with density 3-form @xmath49 . in any local frame @xmath50 with dual coframe @xmath51 the 16 functions @xmath52 , where the frame indices @xmath53 , may be used to construct the second - rank stress - energy tensor @xmath54    a standard application of these general notions is the derivation of the equation of motion of a charged fluid in an external electromagnetic field from the total stress - energy of the fluid and electromagnetic field .",
    "a thermodynamically inert ( cold ) fluid can be modelled with the stress - energy tensor where @xmath55 is a scalar number density field , @xmath56 some constant with the dimensions of mass , @xmath57 the unit time - like 4-velocity field of the fluid and @xmath58 .",
    "such a stress - energy tensor gives rise to a set of killing currents which are added to @xmath59 to yield the total set of killing currents for the interacting system .",
    "if one assumes that the electric current @xmath13-form is @xmath60 for some electric charge constant @xmath61 and that @xmath55 is _ regular _ then the conservation laws yield the field equation of motion this equation must be solved consistently with the maxwell equations ( [ maxeq1 ] ) , ( [ maxeq2 ] ) to determine @xmath57 , @xmath55 and @xmath28 for prescribed initial and boundary conditions .    if the source of @xmath28 contains a _ point charge _ in an external field this approach must take into account that part of the electromagnetic field becomes singular on the world - line of the particle so the domain @xmath23 above must exclude this line .",
    "furthermore , one needs to postulate a stress - energy tensor for a stable point particle . without further information application of stokes theorem",
    "then leaves an unknown contribution to the conservation law .",
    "however , experiment indicates that accelerating electrons ( thought to be point particles ) experience a reaction to their emitted radiation and that the power radiated is in good agreement with the covariant larmor formula @xcite .",
    "a number of methods have been devised in an attempt to accommodate this observed radiation reaction by adopting a regularisation procedure that permits the use of stokes theorem in a spacetime region that includes the particle world - line .",
    "inevitably this requires some assumption of how the singular coulombic stresses are compensated by stresses that are not of electromagnetic origin .",
    "early approaches invoked delicate limiting processes and the use of both advanced as well as retarded solutions to maxwell s equations @xcite .",
    "dirac @xcite offered one of the simplest covariant regularisation schemes and the resulting equation of motion is known as the lorentz - dirac equation .",
    "the use of both advanced and retarded solutions is however unnecessary @xcite .    to highlight the assumptions in the single particle approach to radiation reaction an outline",
    "is given of how the lorentz - dirac equation can be derived using a coordinate system adapted to the light - cone structure of spacetime and the time - like world - line of a particle on a parametrised history given in the above chart as @xmath62 .",

    "suppose the total system ( electromagnetic field and charge ) has a stress - energy tensor giving rise to a _",
    "regular _ killing current @xmath79 such that in a domain @xmath23 bounded by the light - like 3-chains @xmath80 , @xmath81 and the time - like 3-chain @xmath82 for arbitrary positive constants @xmath83 . then    in the limit",
    "@xmath84 this may be written where    with @xmath85 and @xmath86 one has a similar balance of rates for each translational killing vector in the basis . in terms of the `` body '' rate and the contact \" rate",
    "there is a balance of @xmath9-forms :    next assume that the contact rate includes a part from the killing currents @xmath87 , i.e. and furthermore that this part can be calculated from the _ retarded _ linard - wiechert solution @xmath88 to maxwell s equations for an arbitrarily moving point charge @xmath89 in no external electromagnetic field . in these",
    "coordinates the solution is @xmath90 where the 1-form integration over the @xmath27-chain @xmath72 with @xmath91 yields for ( [ p_k_c_dot ] ) : where @xmath92 is the acceleration field .",
    "clearly this 1-form is singular on the world - line where @xmath93 .",
    "the first term however correctly accounts for the observed larmor radiation rate of energy - momentum from an accelerating charge and is independent of @xmath94 . to proceed one must cancel the singular rate in @xmath95 from singular terms in the remaining rates in such a way that in the limit @xmath96 the resulting system of ordinary differential equations for arbitrary @xmath97 makes both mathematical and physical sense",
    "one approach is to suppose that the remaining rates are determined in terms of scalar fields @xmath98 and the vectors @xmath99 such that inserting this in ( [ balance ] ) and applying the projection operator @xmath100 one finds with this value ( [ balance ] ) yields where @xmath101 .",
    "one way to simplify this and cancel the exposed electromagnetic singularity is to further assume that @xmath102 for some _ constant _ @xmath56 so that in the limit @xmath96 one has : or this is a manifestly covariant equation of motion even though the velocity and acceleration are specified in a basis of killing vector fields .",
    "since it is tensorial it is independent of basis and in terms of covariant differentiation along the world - line it may be written this is a system of third order differential equations for the worldline @xmath69 .",
    "regarded as an initial value problem it requires unfamiliar initial data ( @xmath103 ) and solutions exist corresponding to self acceleration which must be regarded as unphysical .    in the presence of an external maxwell field @xmath104 one must confine the motion of the particle to a domain @xmath23 that excludes the sources of @xmath104 .",
    "in this situation one expects that the equation of motion will acquire a contribution from the lorentz force @xmath105 : so that @xmath56 is identified with the rest mass of the point particle .    although solutions to this system that self - accelerate can be eliminated by demanding contrived data at different points along the world - line there remain solutions that pre - accelerate in situations where the external field is piecewise defined in spacetime @xcite .",
    "although the duration of pre - acceleration is probably classically unobservable for most electrons this general feature suggests that not all of the assumptions above are acceptable .    one resolution of these difficulties @xcite is to assume that the right hand side of ( [ lordirac ] ) should be expanded as a series in @xmath89 with leading term for @xmath106 given by @xmath107 .",
    "then the above assumptions are held to be accurate only to some order in @xmath89 and ( [ lordirac ] ) is understood as : where @xmath108 .",
    "the system is now manifestly a second order system of evolution equations .",
    "although this offers a workable scheme it is unclear what its limitations are in different types of external field .",
    "furthermore in situations where one has to contemplate the radiation from a large number of accelerating high - energy particles in close proximity the neglect of higher order terms in the expansion may be suspect .    given the complexities and reservations associated with ( [ newcoveqn ] ) compared with the model leading to ( [ max_lor ] ) the latter is adopted in this article as a description of a collection of potentially radiating particles in the presence of an external electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , our fundamental set of equations is @xmath109 where @xmath110 for all vector fields @xmath111 .    to simplify the subsequent analysis the system ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_f_unscaled]-[np_maxwell_v_v_dot_v_unscaled ] )",
    "is recast using the @xmath27-form @xmath112 and the scalar field @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the proper charge density since @xmath115 is the proper number density .",
    "this yields the system of field equations @xmath116 for the triple @xmath117 .",
    "equation ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_star_f ] ) leads immediately to the integrability condition ( conservation of electric charge ) @xmath118 the scalar field @xmath119 will be referred to as the _ reduced _ proper charge density . since @xmath115 is a number density , @xmath120 and so @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "although the field system ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_f]-[np_maxwell_v_v_dot_v ] ) appears considerably less complicated than a large number of ordinary differential equations for a collection of accelerating charges , it is non - linear in @xmath117 and so obtaining exact solutions is difficult except in certain simple circumstances .",
    "one method of obtaining solutions in more general situations is to employ a perturbation scheme based on properties of a particular class of exact solutions .    in this section a family of _",
    "exact _ dynamical solutions with symmetries generated by @xmath124 and @xmath125 will be described .",
    "such highly symmetric solutions can be interpreted as accelerating `` walls of charge '' moving in vacuo under the influence of their self - fields ( their `` space - charge '' fields ) and an externally applied field .",
