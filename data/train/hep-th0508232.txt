    "the discovery of integrable structures in both the gauge theory  @xcite and string theory  @xcite limits of the ads / cft duality gives a strong hint that @xmath7 supersymmetric gauge theory is solvable , at least in the planar approximation .",
    "subsequently this subject has advanced on many fronts ; for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us note here a few key developments , particularly those concerning the string side and its relation to the gauge side .",
    "for states of large charge , it has been possible to compare the operator dimensions obtained in the gauge and string descriptions  @xcite .",
    "the classical string picture can be derived directly by going to a coherent state representation for the gauge theory operators  @xcite .",
    "however , higher order calculations show that the gauge - string correspondence is not a simple as initially assumed  @xcite . in the string sigma model",
    ", the nonlocal conserved charges can be used to construct a spectral curve that characterizes the general classical solution  @xcite . the bethe ansatz equation for this spectral curve has been further developed and compared with the gauge theory bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the nonlocal charges are conserved in the full quantum sigma model for the @xmath1 string  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite an extension of the bethe ansatz to the quantized sigma model is conjectured , but the discrepancy with the gauge theory remains .",
    "recently there has been further study of the one - loop quantum corrections to the sigma model , again with apparent discrepancies  @xcite .",
    "finally , additional discussions of the sigma model conserved charges and their relation to the gauge theory charges can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "integrability is fairly well developed for the classical sigma model , but the extension to the quantum sigma model is in very preliminary state .",
    "there has been a focus on quantities for which the quantum corrections are hoped to take a rather restricted form  @xcite , but ultimately it is clear that most of the physics of the ads / cft system is dependent on the quantization of the sigma model .",
    "thus in this paper we wish to take a complementary approach , starting with a sigma model where some integrable structure is already known at the quantum level .",
    "this is the @xmath8 coset model  @xcite , specifically @xmath9 , whose bosonic part is @xmath10 . like the @xmath1 world - sheet theory it is conformally invariant and",
    "its target space is a supergroup coset .",
    "it is a different coset , and lacks the ghost and brst structure of the string theory , but still is likely to give a hint of the structure that will appear in the full string theory .    in the coset model",
    "the integrable structure takes the form of an s - matrix .",
    "this is derived by taking the conformal @xmath11 limit of the @xmath12 s - matrix .",
    "the latter  @xcite is obtained from the well - known @xmath13 s - matrix  @xcite by addition of equal numbers of bosonic and fermionic coordinates . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the @xmath11 limit can be defined , and the resulting s - matrix used in a finite - density bethe ansatz .",
    "the limit has the feature that , in addition to the right - moving and left - moving particles that would be expected in a conformal theory , there is a continuum of zero - energy states , so - called ` zero modes '  @xcite though perhaps ` non - movers ' would be more apt .    ref .",
    "@xcite considered only a @xmath14 sector of the sigma model , which is trivial from the point of view of the analogous string theory . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to an @xmath2 sector .",
    "we obtain the bethe ansatz equations for the full quantum sigma model , and then take the classical limit . the classical theory , a bosonic sigma model on an @xmath15 , is identical to the @xmath2 sector of the @xmath1 theory .. ] indeed",
    ", we recover the bethe equation found in refs .",
    "the embedding of this bethe ansatz into a quantum theory is our main result .",
    "one important lesson is that the extension of the classical bethe equations to the quantum theory involves two separate deformations .",
    "the classical sigma model here is the classical _ field _ limit , in which the coupling is taken to zero and the number of quanta is taken to infinity . thus to recover the quantum theory",
    "we must restore finite quantum numbers ( that is , @xmath4 corrections ) , and also include world - sheet quantum effects ( @xmath16 corrections ) .",
    "corrections are strictly absent  the bethe ansatz remains continuous  but the physics certainly depends on @xmath16 .",
    "also , the three loop discrepancy  @xcite is visible in the continuous bethe equations  @xcite , and so should be due to @xmath16 effects . ]",
    "@xcite focussed on the @xmath4 corrections .",
    "we are unable , in our current work , to address these , but we have a full account of the @xmath16 corrections .    in section  2",
    "we review the @xmath8 coset model , the use of the s - matrix , and the bethe ansatz in the @xmath14 sector .",
    "most of the results are from ref .",
    "@xcite , though we treat the classical limit in more detail . in section",
    "3 we obtain the bethe ansatz for the @xmath2 sector , as well as its reductions to single impurities and to nonrelativistic impurities . in section",
    "4 we develop the classical limit .",
    "the zero modes enter in an interesting way : the somewhat complicated form for the bethe equation given in ref .",
    "@xcite arise from a simpler equation when they are integrated out . in the appendix we review the finite hilbert transform , which appears in the classical limit",
    ".    one might wonder whether the agreement between the @xmath2 sectors of our model and the @xmath1 theory , which must hold at the classical level , might fortuitously extend to the quantum theory .",
    "in fact this is unlikely . in our model",
    "there is no supersymmetry connecting the spacelike @xmath15 and the appended time coordinate , so the quantum corrections should take a less restricted form .",
    "in addition , our model appears to have a phase transition at finite world - sheet coupling  @xcite , as we will discuss further in section  2 .",
    "such a transition is not expected in the string theory .",
    "we are currently attempting to extend our approach to the @xmath17 model  @xcite , whose symmetry structure is closer to the string theory .",
    "the bethe ansatz takes a somewhat different form , and the phase transition may be absent .",
    "consider a nonlinear sigma model based on a field @xmath18 whose first @xmath19 components are commuting and whose last @xmath20 components are anticommuting . the action and constraint are @xmath21 where @xmath22\\ .\\ ] ] the action is invariant under an @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "correlation functions of fields restricted to a subset of @xmath24 bosonic components are identical to those of the bosonic @xmath13 coset model , because the path integral over the remaining @xmath20 bosonic coordinates is the reciprocal of the integral over the fermionic coordinates  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the @xmath25 is conformally invariant , because the @xmath26 model is free .",
    "however , it is not rational : it is conformally invariant without a wess - zumino term , and the separate right- and left - moving currents are not conserved .",
    "instead it possesses an infinite family of nonlocal charges constructed from a flat connection , by direct generalization of the construction for the @xmath13 coset  @xcite .    for quantum sigma models ,",
    "the integrable structure is encoded in a factorizable s - matrix  @xcite . for massless theories ,",
    "the usual definition of the s - matrix does not apply because particles moving in the same direction do not separate .",
    "nevertheless , the massless limit of the s - matrix of a massive integrable theory can still be used in the finite density bethe ansatz  @xcite : it retains its interpretation as the relative phase acquired in the wavefunction when one particle is moved past another .",
    "the flat spacetime s - matrix does not directly give the full set of amplitudes needed on the string world - sheet because the string has finite spatial volume while the s - matrix is defined in infinite volume .",
    "in a relativistic field theory the vacuum is nontrivial , and so in finite volume the virtual particle states shift ; one signature of this is the casimir energy .",
    "there do not yet exist general methods to account for this shift and construct the finite volume system .",
    "thus the questions that are readily answered involve states with a large number @xmath27 of real particles , where the effect of the virtual particles represent a relative fraction @xmath28 .",
    "it is not necessary that there be a large net charge @xmath29 , but in fact the bethe ansatz is simplest when all particles have the same sign of the charge , and so we will focus on this case .",
    "thus in our present work we are insensitive to @xmath4 corrections ; going beyond this is an important future direction .",
    "the exact s - matrix for the @xmath13 model is well - known  @xcite , and the @xmath30 symmetry allows this to be lifted in a unique way to the supercoset model  @xcite",
    ". appears and we have no analog of @xmath31 symmetry to remove the unwanted states , but the s - matrix is still defined , and factorizable . ]",

    "in particular the yang - baxter equation is satisfied . since the @xmath38 theory is conformal ,",
    "the @xmath39 function is of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is finite as @xmath11 .",
    "the coupling thus runs arbitrarily slowly as @xmath11 : it is a function of @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dynamically generated mass .",
    "for example , from the one - loop beta function it follows that @xmath44 at large @xmath45 . by holding",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 fixed as @xmath11 and @xmath47 , we obtain a limit in which the coupling takes the constant value @xmath48 . in particular we get the same coupling if we use another reference energy @xmath49 where @xmath50 is fixed , since @xmath51 goes to zero .",
    "in particular , holding fixed the single - particle energy @xmath52 implies that we hold fixed one of @xmath53 thus the excitations that carry energy and momentum separate into a right - moving range with fixed @xmath54 and a left - moving range with fixed @xmath55 .",
    "the rapidity difference between these two sets diverges as @xmath56 .",
    "the surprising result in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we will review below , is that in the limit there remains also a _ continuum _ of ` zero - mode ' excitations between the right- and left - movers . for these , @xmath57 is held finite , where @xmath58 .",
    "the zero modes do not carry single - particle energies , but they affect the total energy through their interaction with the right- and left - movers .",
    "we denote the three types of particle state by @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",

    ". suppose that we define the logarithm differently , so that it increases from @xmath61 to @xmath76 ( taking the latter value at @xmath77 ) , then jumps to @xmath78 and finally increases to @xmath61 , @xmath79 the integer @xmath80 now takes a constant value @xmath81 for all particles , as the jump by @xmath74 on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "note that in this regime , the zero - modes carry nearly all the charge , while the right- and left - movers carry all the energy and momentum .",
    "it is clear from the form of the zero mode equation that as we reduce @xmath45 we reduce @xmath124 and so @xmath16 increases monotonically . in the string",

    "this is a puzzling artifact of this supergroup coset model , which probably has no relevance to the string theory .",
    "excited states , with gaps in the sequence of bethe integers @xmath132 , correspond to excitations of the free field @xmath133  ( [ eq : vartheta ] ) . in the application to string theory these can be removed using the residual gauge freedom of the conformal gauge : we can always choose coordinates in which @xmath134 .",
    "thus to describe the physical states of string theory we can restrict attention to the filled rapidity band .",

    "we have the particular form @xmath145 the integral equation then takes the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 is an unknown function that is holomorphic in the upper half - plane and approaches 0 asymptotically ( this appears because the integral equation holds only for negative @xmath148 ) . multiplying by @xmath149 and rearranging gives @xmath150 the left - hand side is holomorphic in the lower half - plane and approaches 0 asymptotically , and the right - hand side has the same property in the upper half - plane .",
    "it follows that both sides vanish identically , and so @xmath151 explicitly for the kernel  ( [ eq : kg ] ) @xmath152    to match onto the solution away from the endpoint we need only the small-@xmath144 behavior , giving @xmath153 in the bulk we thus look for a solution of the form @xmath154 where @xmath155 and similarly @xmath156 the large-@xmath45 limit of the zero mode equation  ( [ eq : zmeq ] ) at fixed @xmath157 is @xmath158 we will discuss such principal part equations at more length in section  4 .",
