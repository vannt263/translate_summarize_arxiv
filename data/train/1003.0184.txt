    "the canonical function method ( cfm ) is a powerful means for solving the schrdinger equation and getting the eigenvalue spectrum directly in a fast and precise manner without computing the eigenfunctions .",
    "the cfm turns the two - point boundary value ( tpbv ) schrdinger problem into an initial value problem and allows full and accurate determination of the spectrum .",
    "this is done by expressing the solution as a sum of two linearly independent functions ( the canonical functions ) with specific values at some arbitrary point belonging to the interval defined by the two boundaries .",
    "the integration proceeds simultaneously from this point toward the left and right boundaries evaluating at each step a corresponding ratio .",
    "it stops when the difference between the left and right ratios is below a given desired precision .",
    "this work is relevant to students who have completed an undergraduate quantum mechanics course of the merzbacher  @xcite level or graduate students whose level corresponds to landau and lifshitz course  @xcite and are interested in the eigenvalue problem of quantum mechanics .",
    "the cfm can handle a large variety of quantum problem problems  @xcite besides the eigenvalue problem making it an extremely versatile , fast and highly accurate .",
    "the evaluation of the schrdinger operator spectrum is done without performing diagonalization , bypassing the evaluation of the eigenfunctions .",
    "this allows to preserve a high degree of numerical precision that is required in solving sensitive eigenvalue problems .",
    "it also solves the radial schrdinger equation over the infinite interval @xmath0 , where singularities in the potential at both boundaries are encountered .",
    "the cfm method is superior to many standard techniques that have been used to solve the schrdinger equation such as numerov  @xcite or relaxation methods that are particularly tailored for solving tpbv problems ( see the physics reports review  @xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that , numerically , the precision gained with the bypass of intermediate diagonalization operations is reminiscent of the golub - reinsch algorithm ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) used for the singular value decomposition of arbitrary rectangular matrices .",
    "this article is organised as follows : the next section is a description of the cfm in 1d with the appropriate boundary conditions ( bc ) .",
    "several 1d problems are treated : the infinite depth potential well , the finite depth potential well , the harmonic oscillator problem , the kronig - penney potential and the double - well ( symmetric and asymmetric ) potentials . in section iii the cfm is applied to the 3d schrdinger equation specializing to the radial schrdinger equation problems and in particular to the hydrogen atom and the morse potential .",
    "finally section iv bears our conclusions .    in the appendix we provide information on the different systems of units used in atomic physics and quantum mechanics .",
    "the cfm approach is based on the direct calculation of the eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation defined over an interval @xmath1 $ ] with a set of bc defining the problem : @xmath2 \\psi(x)=e \\psi(x ) , \\hspace{2 mm } x_1 \\le x \\le x_2\\ ] ]    @xmath3 is the electron mass .    starting from a point @xmath4 $ ]",
    "we express the solution as a superposition of two linearly independent functions @xmath5 , ( the canonical functions ) depending on the energy @xmath6 and the abscissa @xmath7 such that : @xmath8    the cfm is based on the extraction of the eigenvalues from the zeroes of the eigenvalue function @xmath9 defined from the saturation of the left ( @xmath10 ) and right ( @xmath11 ) functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 given by the ratios of the canonical functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 or their derivatives .    in the general case",
    "when either @xmath16 or @xmath17 we write : @xmath18    the canonical functions satisfy the following conditions at the starting point @xmath19 : @xmath20    let us rewrite the system [ cano ] at the two boundaries @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath23    extracting from above the left and right ratios defining the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath24_{- } = \\frac{\\alpha(e;x_1)y'(x_1)-\\alpha'(e;x_1)y(x_1)}{\\beta'(e;x_1)y(x_1)-\\beta(e;x_1)y'(x_1 ) } ; \\nonumber \\\\ l_{+}(e)=\\left [   \\frac{y'(x_0)}{y(x_0)}\\right]_{+ } = \\frac{\\alpha(e;x_2)y'(x_2)-\\alpha'(e;x_2)y(x_2)}{\\beta'(e;x_2)y(x_2)-\\beta(e;x_2)y'(x_2 ) } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to tackle any problem with the cfm , a number of constraints should be explained and underlined in order to illustrate the methodology of getting properly the eigenvalue spectrum :    * sensitivity , stability and accuracy : + the spectrum depends on the zeroes of @xmath25 .",
    "this subtraction might lead in some cases to inaccuracies because the entire spectrum depends on the zeroes of @xmath9 .",
    "however , it holds the key of the stability of the cfm since two independent solution sets are generated at the point @xmath19 , with progress inwards to the left point @xmath26 and outwards toward the right point @xmath27 .",
    "since both sets contain , in general , linear combinations of the regular and the irregular solutions , by suitably combining them , the irregular solution is eliminated . *",
    "@xmath28 issue and the number of eigenvalues : + the number of eigenvalues depend strongly on @xmath28 . thus , it should be chosen such that a @xmath29-like diagram for the energy function @xmath9 is obtained . in the case",
    "we have a potential displaying a single minimum , @xmath28 should be close to the potential minimum .",
    "* behaviour of the canonical functions : + the method being sensitive to convergence of the marching toward the left - right boundaries @xmath30 , one ought to look for similar behaviour in the canonical functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 along with the limiting process @xmath31 and @xmath32 since it controls the ratio saturation .",
    "* overall aspect of the eigenvalue function : + the eigenvalue function @xmath25 should have a regular structure of the @xmath29 type , that is almost periodic versus @xmath33 .",
    "there are several types of bc from the eigenvalue function defined as the difference between left and right ratio functions : @xmath34_{+ } - \\left[\\frac{y'(x_0)}{y(x_0)}\\right]_{-}\\ ] ]    we consider , for illustration , the following four types of bc :    1 .",
    "null wavefunctions bc : + the conditions @xmath35 yield : + @xmath36",
    "2 .   null wavefunction and its derivative bc : + the conditions @xmath37 yield : + @xmath38 3 .",
    "null derivative and the wavefunction bc : + the conditions @xmath39 yield : + @xmath40 4 .",
    "null derivatives bc : + the conditions @xmath41 yield : + @xmath42    it is remarkable that the eigenvalue function @xmath25 behaves in a very peculiar way close to the trigonometric @xmath29 shape as displayed in fig .  [ tan ] . this will be explained in the next section .",
    "let us apply the cfm to the infinite square well potential of width @xmath43 defined by : + @xmath44 , meaning @xmath45 .",
    "the schrdinger equation writes : @xmath46 with bc : @xmath47 .",
    "the exact eigenfunctions are hence given by @xmath48 yielding the exact eigenvalues as : @xmath49 with @xmath3 the electron mass .",
    "+ in order to apply , the cfm method , we first note that the solutions are odd or even over the interval @xmath50 $ ] . working on the half - interval @xmath51 $ ] we can start from any point @xmath19 and",
    "apply the general methodology albeit with a modification regarding the matching conditions at the middle interval point .    in the odd - mode case ( null wavefunctions at both boundaries @xmath52 ) :    @xmath53    whereas in the even - mode case we have ( null wavefunction at left boundary @xmath54 , null derivative at right boundary @xmath55 ) : @xmath56    solving successively @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the odd modes and the even modes , we get table  [ well ] .",
    ".[well ] first twenty - five odd and even quantum levels of the infinite square well potential given by the cfm along with exact results .",
    "the well width @xmath43 is chosen in a way such that the eigenvalue is 1 when the level index is 25 .",
    "the numbers in parenthesis represent a power of 10 .",
    "all eigenvalues are in atomic units ( see appendix ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the cfm is a very powerful , fast and accurate method that is able to evaluate the eigenvalue spectrum without having to determine first or simultaneously the eigenfunctions .",
    "the cfm has been tested succesfully in a variety of potentials  @xcite and gives accurate results for bound and free states .",
    "the tunable accuracy of our method allows to evaluate eigenvalues close to the ground state as well as close to highly excited states near the continuum limit to a large number of digits without any extrapolation .",
    "+ the cfm compares favorably with many different elaborate techniques based on expansion over basis functions ( such as gaussian  @xcite , quantum chemistry inspired basis functions  @xcite ) or functional expansions ( numerov  @xcite , high - order taylor  @xcite ... ) .",
    "the cfm approach remains the same despite the wide variability of the mentioned problems .",
    "the cfm method used gives the right number of all the levels and the variation of the eigenvalue function @xmath9 definitely determines the total number of levels .",
    "generally in order to avoid potential singularities , taylor series expansion are made to a given order dictated by the required accuracy ( as described in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "+ since the cfm bypasses the calculation of the eigenfunctions , it avoids losing accuracy associated with the numerical calculation specially with rapidly oscillating wave functions of highly excited states .",
    "this is specially needed in the study of the sensitive problem of rydberg states in atomic physics or the determination of vibrational spectra of cold ( weakly - bound ) molecules ...        * atomic and other units * + in atomic and molecular physics , it is convenient to use the elementary charge @xmath59 , as the unit of charge , and the electron mass @xmath3 as the unit of mass ( despite the fact that in some cases the proton mass , @xmath60 , or the unified mass unit amu , is more convenient ) .",
    "electrostatic forces and energies in atoms are proportional to @xmath61 , which has dimensions @xmath62 , and another quantity that appears all over in quantum physics is @xmath63 which has dimensions @xmath64 ; so it is convenient to choose units of length and time such that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .        called the bohr radius , or simply the bohr ( 0.529  ) , because in the `` bohr model '' the radius of the smallest orbit for an electron circling a fixed proton is @xmath68 . in full quantum theory the particles do not follow an orbit but possess wavefunctions and the expectation value of the electron - proton distance in the hydrogen ground state is exactly @xmath68 .",
    "the hartree is twice the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom @xmath71 equal to the rydberg ( 13.6 ev ) . in atomic and molecular spectroscopy",
    ", one uses rather the @xmath72 an energy corresponding to a wavelength of 1 cm or sometimes a frequency unit , the hz .",
