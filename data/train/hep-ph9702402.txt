    "very precise measurements achieved during the last decade have opened up for a new approach in elementary particle physics . according to this , evidence of new particles can be extracted from indirect measurements of their virtual contribution to processes at energies which are too low for direct production .",
    "for example , the top quark mass as predicted from precision electroweak data @xcite agrees to within 10@xmath5 with direct experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "this approach has recently been applied @xcite for the estimation of possible virtual monopole contributions to observables at energies below the monopole mass .",
    "one - loop dyon - induced quantum corrections to the qed lagrangian were discussed in @xcite .",
    "taking into account the violation of parity ( and time - reversal symmetry ) in a theory with monopoles @xcite , the emergence of an electric dipole moment was first pointed out by purcell and ramsey @xcite .",
    "more recently , the effect due to monopole loop contributions has been discussed @xcite .",
    "the calculation of quantum corrections due to the virtual pair creation of dyons is a very difficult problem because the standard diagram technique is not valid in this case .",
    "the difficulty is connected both to the large value of the magnetic charge of the dyon and the lack of a consistent local lagrangian formulation of electrodynamics with two types of charge ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so , there is no possibility to use a perturbation expansion in a coupling constant .",
    "but one can apply the loop expansion which is just an expansion in powers of the planck constant @xmath6 .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) that the one - loop quantum correction to the qed lagrangian can be calculated without the use of perturbation methods .",
    "the correction is just the change in the vacuum energy in an external field .",
    "let us review the simple case of weak constant parallel electric and magnetic fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we impose the conditions @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that the creation of particles is not possible . in this case",
    "the one - loop correction can be calculated by summing the one - particle modes  the solutions of the dirac equation in the external electromagnetic field  over all quantum numbers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for example , if there is just a magnetic field , @xmath11 , the corresponding equation is @xmath12 \\psi ( x ) = 0\\ ] ] where the electromagnetic potential is @xmath13 .",
    "the solution to this equation gives the energy levels of an electron in a magnetic field @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the electron momentum along the field . in this case",
    "the correction to the lagrangian is @xcite @xmath18   \\nonumber       \\\\ = - \\frac{1}{8 \\pi ^2 } \\int \\limits _ 0^{\\infty } \\frac{\\d s}{s^3 }   e^{-m^2 s } \\left [ ( esh)~{\\rm coth}~(esh ) - 1 - \\frac{1}{3 } e^2 s^2 h^2 \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the terms independent of the external field @xmath8 are dropped and a standard renormalization of the electron charge has been made @xcite .",
    "if we consider simultaneously magnetic ( @xmath8 ) and electric ( @xmath7 ) homogeneous fields , then equation ( [ dirac ] ) , as well as its classical analogue can be separated into two uncoupled equations , each in two variables @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this case we can take @xmath19 and the interactions of an electron with the fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 are determined independently .",
    "for such a configuration of electromagnetic fields the correction to the lagrangian is ( see @xcite , p.  787 ) @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the correction to the energy of an electron in the combined external magnetic and electric fields , which is in the first order proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "so , the total lagrangian is @xmath23 , where @xmath24   is just the lagrangian of the free electromagnetic field in the tree approximation , and can be written as @xmath25 the logarithmic divergency can be removed by the standard renormalization of the external fields and the electron charge : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the usual qed renormalization factor .",
    "thus the finite part of the correction to the lagrangian @xmath28 can be written in terms of physical quantities as ( see @xcite , p.  790 ) @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which in the limit @xmath30 reduces to the renormalized form of ( [ dele ] ) .    the series expansion of ( [ deltal ] ) in terms of the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 yields the well known euler - heisenberg correction @xcite : @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "let us consider how the situation changes if we consider the virtual pair creation of dyons in the external electromagnetic field .",
    "using an analogy with the classical lorentz force on a dyon of velocity @xmath35 with electric ( @xmath36 ) and magnetic ( @xmath37 ) charges @xcite @xmath38 we shall assume that the wave equation for this particle in an external electromagnetic field can be expressed as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath3 is the dyon mass , and @xmath40 a generalized momentum operator , with @xmath41 .",
    "the potential @xmath42 and its dual @xmath43 are defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor , i.e. , for constant electromagnetic fields or for free electromagnetic waves . ] and @xmath46 .",
    "the potentials in the case of constant parallel electric and magnetic fields can be expressed as @xmath47    it is easily seen that the solution to the equation of motion for a dyon in an external electromagnetic field can be obtained from the solution to the equation for an electron ( [ dirac ] ) by the following substitution @xmath48 using the same substitution as in eqs .",
    "( [ ltot ] ) and ( [ deltal ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the quantum correction to the lagrangian , due to the vacuum polarization caused by dyons : @xmath49 where a total derivative has been dropped .    for the renormalization of this expression we can introduce the renormalization factors @xcite @xmath50 which are generalizations of the definition @xmath51 of eq .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) . in this case",
    "the fields and charges are renormalized as @xcite @xmath52 this relation ( [ renorm - dual ] ) means that the vacuum of electrically charged particles shields the external electromagnetic field but the contribution from magnetically charged particles antishields it .",
    "this agrees with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "considering now the case of weak electromagnetic fields , the finite part of the lagrangian @xmath28 , can , by analogy with ( [ deltal - euler ] ) , be written as @xmath53 ( \\vech^2 - \\vece^2)^2   + [ 16 q^2 g^2 + 7 ( q^2 - g^2)^2](\\vech \\vece)^2 \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\hspace*{20 mm } + 6 qg ( q^2 - g^2)(\\vech \\vece)(\\vech^2 - \\vece^2 ) \\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the expressions ( [ deltal - euler ] ) and ( [ deltal - dyon ] ) describe nonlinear corrections to the maxwell equations which correspond to photon - photon interactions . the principal difference between the formula ( [ deltal - dyon ] ) and",
    "the standard euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian consists in the appearance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 non - invariant terms proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "it should however be noted that this term is invariant under charge conjugation @xmath55 , since then _ both _ @xmath36 and @xmath37 would change sign .",
    "if we consider separately the virtual creation of dyon pairs , then because of invariance of the model under a dual transformation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) the physics is determined not by the values @xmath36 and @xmath37 separately , but by the effective charge @xmath56 .",
    "in the same way the operations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 inversions are modified .",
    "however we will consider simultaneously the contributions from vacuum polarization by electron - positron and dyon pairs . in this case",
    "it is not possible to reformulate the theory in terms of just one effective charge by means of a dual transformation .",
    "moreover the dirac charge quantization condition connects just the electric charge of the electron and the magnetic charge of a dyon : @xmath57 whereas the electric charge @xmath36 is not quantized .",
    "it is widely believed , based both on experimental bounds and theoretical predictions @xcite that the dyon mass would be large , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the electron mass .",
    "thus , in the one - loop approximation the first non - linear correction to the qed lagrangian from summing the contributions ( [ deltal - euler ] ) and ( [ deltal - dyon ] ) can be written as @xmath60 + \\frac{qg ( q^2 - g^2)}{60 \\pi ^2 m^4 }   ( \\vech \\vece ) ( \\vech^2 - \\vece^2),\\ ] ] where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 invariant terms corresponding to vacuum polarization by dyons have been dropped because they are suppressed by factors @xmath61 .",
    "thus , their contribution to the effective lagrangian will be of the same order as that of the ordinary qed multiloop amplitudes which we neglect .",
    "expression ( [ deltal - dyon - e ] ) yields the matrix element for low - energy photon - photon scattering . in order to determine it , we substitute into ( [ deltal - dyon - e ] ) the expansion @xmath62 corresponding to the second term of ( [ deltal - dyon - e ] ) we find @xmath63 where @xmath64 \\ , .\\ ] ] symmetrizing this pseudotensor one obtains the @xmath0 and @xmath1 violating part of the matrix element for light - by - light scattering . with all momenta flowing inwards , @xmath65 ,",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the interaction contains an @xmath67 tensor , the coupling between two of the photons is different from that involving the other two , and the familiar pairwise equivalence of the six terms does not hold .",
    "the matrix element satisfies gauge invariance ( with respect to any of the four photons ) , @xmath68 we note that the above contribution to the matrix element is proportional to the fourth power of the inverse dyon mass , @xmath69 . however , this result is only valid at low energies , where the photon momenta are small compared to @xmath3 , being obtained from an effective , non - renormalizable theory .",
    "thus , as a result of interference between two one - loop diagrams corresponding to loops with dyons and those with simply electrically charged particles there is an asymmetry between the processes of photon splitting and photon coalescence @xcite . the physical effect of this asymmetry will depend on the photon spectrum and the directions of the photon momenta with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "in particular , the asymmetry vanishes when these are perpendicular , i.e. for @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the asymmetry is linear in the product of the dyon charges , and proportional to the fourth power of the electron to dyon mass ratio .",
    "the contribution of this matrix element ( [ matrix ] ) breaks the @xmath0 and @xmath1 invariance of ordinary electrodynamics .",
    "thus , among the sixth - order radiative corrections to the electron - photon vertex there are terms containing this photon - photon scattering subdiagram with a dyon loop contribution ( see fig .  1 ) , that induce an electric dipole moment of the electron @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can write the contribution of this diagram to the electron - photon vertex as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the polarization pseudotensor representing the dyon box diagram contribution to the photon - photon scattering amplitude , the low - energy limit of which is given by the pseudotensor @xmath73 of eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) .    in order to extract the electric dipole moment from the general expression ( [ vertex ] ) it is convenient , according to the approach by @xcite to exploit the identity @xmath74 which can be obtained upon differentiating the gauge invariance condition of the polarization tensor [ cf .",

    "( [ rel - repr ] ) with the phenomenological expression for the electric dipole moment @xmath89 @xcite : @xmath90 in the non - relativistic limit it corresponds to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath91 .",

    "( [ vertex ] ) , we would obtain a quadratically divergent integral .",

    "@xcite to be @xmath99 the vertex function depends on @xmath100 , the photon momentum entering the vertex , and on @xmath101 , a unit constant space - like vector corresponding to the dirac singularity line .",
    "it was shown by zwanziger @xcite that although the matrix element depends on @xmath102 , the cross section as well as other physical quantities are @xmath102 independent",
    ".    calculations using this technique are very complicated and can only be done in a few simple situations @xcite , for example , in the case of the charge - monopole scattering problem @xcite .",
    "we will here avoid this approach .    while the integration over @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ int - q ] ) is logarithmically divergent ( the magnetic couplings in ( [ int - q ] ) are dimensionless ) , after renormalization the sum of such contributions must in the low - energy limit reduce to the form given in eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "we also note that the substitution of ( [ int - q ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ vertex - tens ] ) yields a convergent integral .",
    "thus , the following method for evaluating @xmath104 suggests itself .",
    "we divide the region of integration into two domains : ( i ) the momenta @xmath105 and @xmath106 are small compared to @xmath3 , and ( ii ) the momenta are of order @xmath3 ( or larger ) .    in the first region ,",
    "the form ( [ matrix ] ) can be used , but since the integral is quadratically divergent , the integral will be proportional to @xmath107 . together with the over - all factor @xmath61",
    "this will give a contribution @xmath108 .",
    "for large values of the photon momenta , the other form , eq .",
    "( [ int - q ] ) can be used .",
    "this gives a convergent integral , and dimensional arguments determine the scale to be @xmath2 .",

    "( [ dip - mom ] ) is assumed cancelled by a combinatorial factor from the number of diagrams involved .",
    "this is of course a very rough assessment .",
    "now we can estimate the order of magnitude of the electron dipole moment generated by virtual dyons .",
    "it is obvious from eqs .",
    "( [ dip - mom ] ) and ( [ estim ] ) , that in order of magnitude one can write @xmath113    this estimate can be used to obtain a new bound on the dyon mass .",
    "indeed , recent experimental progress in the search for an electron electric dipole moment @xcite gives a rather strict upper limit : @xmath114 cm . if we suppose that @xmath115 , then from ( [ dip - mom - est ] ) one can obtain @xmath116 gev .",
    "this estimate shows that the dyon mass belongs at least to the electroweak scale .",
    "the above estimate coincides with the bound obtained by de rjula @xcite for monopoles , from an analysis of lep data , but it is weaker than the result given in @xcite , where the limit @xmath117 gev was obtained .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the hypothesis that a radial magnetic field could be induced due to virtual dyon pairs . in order to estimate the effect , they used the well - known formula for the ueling correction to the electrostatic potential , simply replacing the electron charge and mass with those of the monopole .",
    "but the ueling term is just a correction to the scalar coulomb potential due to vacuum polarization and can not itself be considered as a source of a radial magnetic field .",
    "indeed , there is only one second order term in the effective lagrangian that can violate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 invariance of the theory , namely @xmath118 .",
    "but in the framework of qed there is no reason to consider such a correction because it is just a total derivative .",
    "the reference to the @xmath119-term , used in @xcite to estimate the electric charge of the dyon , is only relevant in the context of a non - trivial topology ( e.g. , in the t hooft - polyakov monopole model ) where their limit applies . in this case",
    "there are arguments in favour of stronger limits on the monopole ( dyon ) mass ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one should note that the dyon loop diagram considered above can also contribute to the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "the experimental value @xmath120 cm @xcite will in the naive quark model with @xmath121  mev allow us to obtain an estimate of the dyon lower mass bound which is similar to the one obtained for the electron .",
