    "the main examples of such @xmath1 are stopping times , the time of the infimum and the last exit time from @xmath5 $ ] , all of which fall in the category of so - called randomized coterminal times  @xcite .",
    "the first example is rather trivial , and the latter two have the same structure , i.e.  the time of the infimum can be seen as the last exit time from a random interval @xmath6 $ ] . thus it is not surprising that they lead to the same law for the post-@xmath1 process : the law of @xmath7 conditioned to stay above a certain level . for a lvy process",

    "the aim of this work is to develop the corresponding theory for markov additive processes ( maps ) , which are the processes with stationary and independent increments given the current phase .",
    "these processes often appear in finance , queueing and risk theories  @xcite , and recently were found to be instrumental in the analysis of real self - similar markov processes , see  @xcite .",
    "even though maps closely resemble lvy processes , their increments are not exchangeable , and hence one may expect certain difficulties as well as apriory non - obvious differences from the lvy case .",

    "* time reversal and equivalence of laws : * * section  [ sec : rev_zeta ] discusses _ time reversal at the life time _ of the process . in general , the life time depends on the process and hence the time reversal identity is different from the classical formula concerning reversal at an independent time . *",

    "these works consider maps killed at independent exponential times , which would be natural for lvy processes , but is not fully satisfactory for maps .",
    "moreover , we allow for counting time in each phase separately .",
    "finally , we provide some necessary corrections to the factorizations in the literature . * _ spectrally negative maps _ :",
    "section  [ sec : spneg ] further develops the above results in the important case when the process does not have positive jumps . in particular , the wiener - hopf factors are given by compact explicit formulas , which are then compared to the results in  @xcite .",

    "the above list shows that splitting and time reversal results for maps closely resemble analogous results for lvy processes , which should help in understanding the present theory and its application .",
