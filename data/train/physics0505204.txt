    "engagement of electron storage rings for production of x rays through compton scattering of laser photons against ultrarelativistic electrons was proposed in 1998 @xcite .",

    "one of them supposes use of electron beams with unsteady parameters @xcite and applies the continual injection ( and ejection of circulating bunches by the next injecting pulse ) of dense intensive bunches .",

    "is proposed to employ @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal dynamics in the small compaction lattice is governed not only by the linear effects of the momentum deviation but by the nonlinear ones as well .    in compton sources storing the bunches with the large energy spread which can be as high as a few percents ,",
    "ring s energy acceptance becomes compared to the energy spread . to get proper life time of the circulating electrons ,",
    "the energy acceptance @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the energy of synchronous particle ) should be high enough .    within a linear approximation according to the energy deviation",
    ", the acceptance can be increased either by enhancement of the rf voltage , @xmath2 , or by decreasing of the linear momentum compaction factor @xmath3 since @xmath4 .",
    "the paper presents results of study on the longitudinal dynamics of electron bunches circulating in storage rings with a small linear momentum compaction factor @xmath3 .",
    "structure of the phase space are considered and its deformation with changes in the ring lattice parameters . in particular , the size of stable area as a function of the rf voltage and momentum compaction is evaluated .",
    "let us consider a model of the ring comprised only two components : drift and radio frequency ( rf ) cavity .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we will suggest the cavity infinitely short , in which the particle momentum ( energy ) suffer an abrupt change while the phase of a particle remains unchanged . on the contrary , the phase of a particle traveling along the drift changes while the energy remains invariable . the longitudinal motion in a such idealized ring",
    "will be described in canonically conjugated variables @xmath5 ( the phase about zero voltage in the cavity ) and the momentum @xmath6 equal to the relative deviation of the particle energy from the synchronous one ( @xmath7 is the lorentz factor of the synchronous particle ) .    to study systems able to confine the beams with large energy spread , one needs to account not only the linear part of the orbit deviation from the synchronous one , but nonlinear terms as well : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the dispersion functions of the first and second orders , respectively .",

    "does not exceed a few percents , and the momentum compaction factor @xmath3 supposed small . from these assumptions ,",
