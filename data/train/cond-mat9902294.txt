    "ginzburg - landau effective description of high @xmath1 superconductors has been remarkably successful in describing various thermodynamical and transport properties @xcite .",
    "however when fluctuations are of importance , even this effective description becomes very complicated .",
    "some progress can be achieved when certain additional assumptions are made .",
    "one of the often made additional assumption is that only the lowest landau level ( lll ) significantly contributes to physical quantities of interest @xcite .",
    "there is a debate however on how restrictive the lll approximation actually is .",
    "naively when @xmath2 ( see the dotted line on fig .",
    "1 ) , even within mean field approximation , one should consider higher landau levels ( hll ) mixing in the abrikosov vortex lattice solution of the gl equations .",
    "when fluctuations are included one can argue using hartree approximation @xcite that the lll range of validity is even smaller .",
    "however direct application of the lll scaling to magnetization and specific heat on ybco suggest that the range of applicability is much wider - all the way down to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is not clear why hll do not contribute .    in this paper",
    "we explicitly calculate the effects of hll at low temperatures in the vortex solid or liquid phase and establish the realistic range where the lll approximation is valid ( see the heavy dashed line on fig.1 ) .",
    "we reanalyze the hll corrections to mean field equations going to higher order then in @xcite and find that the expansion converges for @xmath4 .",
    "importantly within this radius of convergence the lll contribution constitutes more than @xmath5 .",
    "then we calculate the hll fluctuation effects to one loop order complementing the lll calculation to two loops by one of us @xcite ( later referred to as i ) .",
    "ginzburg parameter @xmath6 characterizing importance of thermal fluctuations is much larger in high @xmath1 superconductors then in the low temperature ones .",
    "moreover in the presence of magnetic field the importance of fluctuations in high @xmath1 superconductors is further enhanced . under these circumstances corrections to various physical quantities like magnetization or specific heat",
    "are not negligible even at low temperatures .",
    "it is quite straightforward to systematically account for the fluctuations effect on magnetization , specific heat or conductivity perturbatively above the mean field transition line using ginzburg - landau description @xcite .",
    "however in the interesting region below this line it turned out to be extremely difficult to develop a quantitative theory .",
    "within lll in order to approach the region below the mean field transition line @xmath7 thouless @xcite proposed a perturbative approach around homogeneous ( liquid ) state was in which all the  bubble ",
    "diagrams are resumed .",
    "the series provide accurate results at high temperatures , but for the lll dimensionless temperature @xmath8 become inapplicable .",
    "generally attempts to extend the theory to lower temperature by pade extrapolation were not successful @xcite .",
    "alternative , more direct approach to low temperature fluctuations physics is to start from the mean field solution and then take into account perturbatively fluctuations around this inhomogeneous solution . experimentally it is reasonable since , for example , specific heat at low temperatures is a smooth function and the fluctuations contribution experimentally is quite small .",
    "for some time this was in disagreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "eilenberger calculated spectrum of harmonic excitations of the triangular vortex lattice ( see eq.([elspec ] ) below ) @xcite and noted that the gapless mode is softer then the usual goldstone mode expected as a result of spontaneous breaking of translational invariance .",
    "the inverse propagator for the  phase  excitations behaves as @xmath9 .",
    "the influence of this unexpected additional  softness  apparently goes beyond enhancement of the contribution of fluctuations at leading order .",
    "it leads to disastrous infrared divergencies at higher orders rendering the perturbation theory around the vortex state doubtful .",
    "one therefore tends to think that nonperturbative effects are so important that such a perturbation theory should be abandoned @xcite .",
    "however it was shown in i that a closer look at the diagrams reveals that in fact one encounters actually only logarithmic divergencies .",
    "this makes the divergencies similar to so called  spurious  divergencies in the theory of critical phenomena with broken continuous symmetry and they exactly cancel at each order provided we are calculating a symmetric quantity .",
    "qualitatively physics of fluctuating @xmath10 gl model in magnetic field turns out to be similar to that of spin systems in @xmath11 possessing a continuous symmetry .",
    "in particular , although within perturbation theory in thermodynamic limit the ordered phase ( solid ) exists only at @xmath12 , at low temperatures liquid differs very little in most aspects from solid .",
    "one can effectively use properly modified perturbation theory to quantitatively study various properties of the vortex liquid phase .",
    "this perturbative approach agrees very well with the direct monte carlo simulation of @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether one can extend the well controlled perturbative calculation beyond the lll .",
    "sometimes a hope is expressed that the additional softness is an accidental artifact of lll approximation .",
    "the present work explicitly shows that this is not so .",
    "it is a fundamental general phenomenon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "model is described and perturbative mean field solution developed in section ii .",
    "the expansion parameter will be the distance from the mean field critical line @xmath13 .",
    "range of validity of the expansion and of the lll approximation is discussed .",
    "then in section iii we derive the spectrum of excitations to leading order and to the next to leading order in @xmath14 . the free energy to one loop",
    "is calculated in section iv .",
    "section v contains expressions for magnetization and specific heat and discussion of validity range of the fluctuation contributions calculation .",
    "finally we summarize the results in section vi .",
    "details of the mean field calculation can be found in appendix a , while details of the hll spectrum calculation can be found in appendix b.",
    "our starting point is the gl free energy : @xmath15 here @xmath16 describes a nonfluctuating constant magnetic field . for",
    "strongly type ii superconductors ( @xmath17 ) far from @xmath18(this is the range of interest in this paper ) magnetic field is homogeneous to a high degree due to superposition from many vortices . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath19 , @xmath20 although this dependence can be easily modified to better describe the experimental coherence length",
    ".    throughout most of the paper will use the following units .",
    "unit of length is @xmath21 and unit of magnetic field is @xmath22 , so that dimensionless magnetic field is @xmath23 .",
    "the dimensionless boltzmann factor in these units is ( the order parameter field is rescaled as @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 the dimensionless coefficient is @xmath26 where the ginzburg number is defined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 is an anisotropy parameter .",
    "this coefficient determines the strength of fluctuations , but is irrelevant as far as mean field solutions are concerned .",
    "now we turn to a perturbative solution of the ginzburg - landau equations near the mixed state - normal phase transition line .",
    "this has been done before @xcite to the second order , however the range of applicability and precision of the lll approximation at large @xmath29 has not been fully explored .",
    "the @xmath30 direction dependence of the solutions is trivial and will not be mentioned until fluctuations will be discussed .",
    "the expansion parameter is @xmath31 rewriting the quadratic part in terms of operator (  hamiltonian  )",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 whose spectrum starts from zero , one obtains the following free energy density over @xmath34 @xmath35 the equation of motion is therefore @xmath36 this equation is solved perturbatively in @xmath14 by assuming @xmath37   \\label{phi}%\\ ] ] it is convenient to represent @xmath38 in the basis of eigenfunctions of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , normalized to unit  cooper pairs density  @xmath41 , where  cell  is a primitive  cell of the vortex lattice .",

    "inner product with @xmath55 determines @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 to find @xmath59 we need in addition also the order @xmath60 equation : @xmath61 inner product with @xmath46 gives : @xmath62      the mean field expression for the free energy to order @xmath63 is well known . inserting the next correction eq.([phi ] ) into eq.([den ] ) one obtains the free energy density : @xmath64   = \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\left [   -.43a_{h}^{2}-.0078\\frac{a_{h}^{3}}% { b}\\right ]   \\label{fmf}%\\ ] ]    it is interesting to note that @xmath65 only when @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is an integer .",
    "this is due to hexagonal symmetry of the vortex lattice@xcite .",
    "for @xmath66 it decreases very fast with @xmath67 : @xmath68 because of this the coefficient of the next to leading order is very small ( additional factor of @xmath69 in the denominator ) .",
    "we might preliminarily conclude therefore that the perturbation theory in @xmath14 works much better that might be naively anticipated ( see dashed line on fig.1 ) and can be used very far from transition line . if we demand that the correction is smaller then the main contribution the corresponding line on the phase diagram will be @xmath70 . for example the lll melting line corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "this overly optimistic conclusion is however incorrect as calculation of the following term in appendix a shows .",
    "now we discuss in what region of the parameter space the expansion outlined above can be applied .",
    "first of all note that all the contributions to @xmath72 are proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "this is a general feature : the actual expansion parameter is @xmath74 .",
    "one can as whether the expansion is convergent and , if yes , what is its radius of convergence .",
    "looking just at the leading correction and comparing it to the lll one gets a very optimistic estimate . for this purpose we calculated higher orders coefficients in appendix a.",
    "the results for the @xmath75 are following : @xmath76   \\label{g2n}%\\ ] ]    and @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 when @xmath80 is defined to be equal to @xmath81 when @xmath82    we already can see that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are proportional to @xmath85 and in addition there is a factor of @xmath86 .",
    "since , due to hexagonal lattice symmetry all the @xmath56 , @xmath87 vanish , so do @xmath83 .",
    "we checked that there is no more small parameters , so we conclude that the leading order coefficient is much larger than first ( factor @xmath88 ) , but the second is only @xmath69 times larger than the third .",
    "the correction to free energy is@xmath89",
    "accidental smallness by factor @xmath90 of the coefficients in the @xmath91 expansion due to symmetry means that the range of validity of this expansion is roughly @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "moreover additional smallness of all the hll corrections compared to the lll means that they constitute just several percent of the correct result inside the region of applicability . to illustrate this point we plot on the fig.2 the perturbatively calculated solution for @xmath94 .",
    "one can see that although the leading lll function has very thick vortices ( fig .",
    "2a ) , the first nonzero correction makes them of order of the coherence length ( fig .",
    "following correction of the order @xmath95 makes it practically indistinguishable from the numerical solution .",
    "amazingly the order parameter between the vortices approaches its vacuum value .",
    "paradoxically starting from the region close to @xmath22 the perturbation theory knows to correct the order parameter so that it looks very similar to the london approximation ( valid only close to @xmath18 ) result  of well separated vortices .",
    "we conclude therefore that the expansion in @xmath96 works in the mean field better that one can naively expect . in the next section",
    "we investigate whether the same is true for the fluctuation contribution .",
    "to find an excitation spectrum in harmonic approximation one expands free energy functional around the solution found in the previous section . within the lll approximation",
