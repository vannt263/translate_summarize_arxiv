    "[ fig : berrymonopole ] demonstrates the elementary case of the level crossing , where only two branches of spectra touch each other . near the crossing point",
    "the complex @xmath9 hamiltonian is effectively reduced to the @xmath3 matrix @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the pauli matrices . in the vicinity of the weyl point @xmath12 , only linear terms in expansion of the hamiltonian",
    "are important , and one obtains the effective hamiltonian @xmath13 in the non - uniform situation the parameters of expansion @xmath14 and @xmath12 become the fields , and then the hamiltonian ( [ 2x2expansion ] ) describes the weyl relativistic particle with spin @xmath15 , which propagates in the effective gravitational field of the dreibein @xmath16 and in the effective electromagnetic field @xmath17 .",
    "this may suggest , that the weyl particles of the standard model , the relativistic spin , the gauge and gravitational fields and all the other staff of relativistic quantum fields could be the emergent phenomena , which originate from the level crossing in the underlying deep quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the level crossing first discussed by von neumann and wigner @xcite is the robust phenomenon , which is supported by topology @xcite .",
    "that is why it may lead to the universal consequences which do not depend much on the microscopic details of the deep quantum vacuum .    in the simple case of @xmath3 complex matrix",

    "this suggests that the chiral nature of left - handed and right - handed quarks and leptons could be also the emergent phenomenon .",
    "the more interesting geometry and topology of the crossing points occur if the symmetries of the hamiltonian are taken into account .",
    "for example , starting from purely real hamiltonians @xmath21 , one finds that depending on symmetry of @xmath21 the effective quasiparticles emerging near the crossing point may behave as majorana , dirac or weyl fermions .",
    "@xcite this suggests that appearance of complex numbers in quantum mechanics is also the emergent phenomenon , i.e. complex numbers emerge in the low energy description of the underlying high energy theory together with weyl particles and gauge and gravitational fields .",
    "the symmetry consideration is especially important for standard model vacuum in its symmetric semimetal phase above the electroweak transition . in this phase",
    "the total topological charge @xmath5 of the multiple crossing point at @xmath22 is zero , @xmath23 , where the sum is over all the fermions .",
    "the massless weyl particles survive only due to a special symmetry between the fermions , which does not allow for mixing of weyl points with opposite topological charges and thus protects the masslessness of quarks and leptons .",
    "however , at this point the formulation in terms of the berry phase becomes too complicated .",
    "moreover , this formulation is not complete , since it is applicable only to single - particle hamiltonians and thus only to the non - interacting quantum fields .",
    "the more relevant formulation is in terms of the green s function topology , since it automatically includes the interactions . in this approach the topological invariants ( chern numbers ) can be expressed via the green s function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is matsubara frequency ( see the earlier papers on the quantum hall effect , quantum hall topological insulators and chern - simons action @xcite and on topology of nodes in fermionic spectrum @xcite , and the more recent papers @xcite ) .    the weyl point represents the green s function singularity described by the @xmath26 topological invariant : @xcite @xmath27 here the integral is over the 3d surface @xmath28 around the singular point in the 4-momentum space @xmath29 . for the non - interacting fermions one has @xmath30 , and in case of @xmath3 matrix hamiltonian the eq.([masslesstopinvariant3d ] ) transforms to the equation in fig .",
