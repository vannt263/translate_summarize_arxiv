    "despite the increases in safety introduced into the automobile , at latest count ( 2010 ) the number of deaths is over 30,000 , the number of injuries is over two million , and the number of crashes is over five million @xcite . in order to reduce such causalities , the federal communications commission has allocated 75 mhz of spectrum in the 5.9 ghz band for dedicated short range communications ( dsrc ) .",
    "furthermore , the ieee 802.11p standard was presented in 2010 for wireless access applications in vehicular environments @xcite .",
    "rear end collisions represent some 28% of the crashes among all drivers @xcite .",
    "this type of collision occurs because of the time that it takes for a driver to perceive and react to a sudden deceleration of the leader vehicle .",
    "therefore , rear - end collision warning systems have been studied extensively .",
    "radical improvement in the effectiveness of collision warning systems are now possible due to the progress that is being made in vehicular ad hoc networks ( vanet ) .",
    "vehicular ad hoc networks allow all vehicles to communicate with each other ( v2v or vehicle to vehicle communications ) and with technologies embedded in the infrastructure that transmit crash relevant information ( v2i or vehicle to infrastructure communications ) .",
    "our main contributions in this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we find closed form expression of packet success probability for the slotted synchronous p - persistent mac scheme in a chain of vehicles .",
    "the expression for the slotted asynchronous p - persistent is also derived .",
    "2 .   we derive the average delay of reception at a vehicle in a chain .",
    "3 .   we let the probability of collision dictate the transmission probabilities of the vehicles .",
    "in other words , we propose to develop vanet protocols that prioritize the communications of information based on the danger that a driver is facing .",
    "our simulations reveal that the collision probability is drastically reduced when it is the main factor in determining the transmission probabilities of the vehicles .",
    "communications between vehicles can help decrease collisions in an n - lane highway(fig . [ fig_advantage ] ) .",
    "also , it was shown in theory and simulation that assuming the equal channel access probability for all the vehicles , there is an optimal channel access probability which results in the maximum success probability and lower expected collision probability @xcite .",
    "a large channel access probability leads the system to an excessive interference and consequently low success probability while a very small value reduces the success probability since the probability of the favorite transmission is low itself . in section [ simulation ]",
    ", it is shown that there could be nonequal channel access probabilities for different vehicles leading to even lower collision probability .",
    "consider a traffic stream where a chain of vehicles move with constant speed v and randomly chosen inter - vehicle spacing .",
    "when @xmath0 ( the first vehicle in the chain ) brakes , the driver of @xmath1 ( the following vehicle ) , after her perception reaction time , @xmath2 , applies the brake . having no inter - vehicle communications employed , vehicle @xmath3 applies the brake after @xmath4 , the sum of perception reaction times up to the driver @xmath5 . with the communications ,",
    "this time will change to @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is the communications delay to inform vehicle @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath7 can be a result of direct communications from @xmath0 to @xmath8 or the retransmission of @xmath0 s signal by one of the vehicles in the middle . understandably , when @xmath9 , @xmath8 has more time to react and the probability of collision is reduced ( fig .",
    "[ comm_delay ] ) .          the mac scheme that we consider is ssp ( slotted synchronous p - persistent ) where at each slot a node ( vehicle ) transmits with probability @xmath10 and receives with probability @xmath11 independent of others .",
    "the important assumption is that the slots are synchronized because of the on - board gps devices .",
    "moreover , since the vehicles are not faced with power constraints , the nodes can increase the transmission power to overcome the interference .",
    "in this paper , we consider path loss and rayleigh fading for formalizing the signal propagation characteristics .",
    "if we assume that the nodes transmit with unit power , the received power at distance @xmath12 is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the path loss exponent and @xmath15 is the fading coefficient .    assuming that a node transmits a packet , the probability that a receiver at distance @xmath12 receives the packet successfully is : @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the set of all nodes",
    ", @xmath18 is a bernoulli random variable with parameter @xmath19 , @xmath19 is the probability that node @xmath5 transmits , and @xmath20 denotes the distance from node @xmath5 to the receiver .",
    "note that the above equation is true for an n - lane highway if we neglect the distance between the lanes .",
    "in other words , in an n - lane highway scenario , node @xmath5 could be any vehicle in each of the lanes , and @xmath17 is the set of all vehicles moving in all lanes as every vehicle can cause interference for the desired receiver .",
    "if the time slots in which nodes transmit are not synchronized , this scheme is named _ slotted asynchronous p - persistent_. in this case , an interferer can potentially interfere with at most two time slots of another transmission .",
    "hence , the transmission probability for the interferers is @xmath21 .",
    "since the probabilities are small , this approximation is tight .",
    "we assume that the less safe is a driver , the more frequently the driver needs to transmit information to the network .",
    "moreover , the driver safety index could be changed in real time . as an example , if a driver s brake reaction time is relatively long , then driver s safety index will be relatively low and so more data will put on the air from the corresponding vehicle . in this paper ,",
    "vehicles are simply divided into two categories :    * unsafe vehicles * safe vehicles    unsafe vehicles are the ones which their drivers have long perception - reaction time and low distance to the vehicle in front . to put it differently ,",
    "unsafe vehicles have higher collision probability . our algorithm to determine an unsafe vehicle is an iterative one .",
    "the collision probability is calculated in each iteration using only the physical parameters such as distance , velocity , .... then , it ll be used to see what channel access probability is suitable for a vehicle .",
    "we proposed a method to estimate the distribution of perception reaction times for an individual driver using the data obtained from vehicular ad hoc networks @xcite .",
    "hence , the estimates of perception reaction times are available to us . also , we know that some of the vehicles are too far from the vehicle @xmath0 to be able to receive the messages directly from it .",
    "thus , when one of the vehicles in the middle gets informed and reacts to the event , the message will be forwarded to the vehicles at a greater distance from the leading vehicle . in other words , after a vehicle in the middle starts decelerating , the new status will be included in the new messages from this vehicle to further upstream vehicles .",
    "we need to calculate the time it takes for a message to be received by vehicle @xmath5 .",
    "it is sufficient that the message be received successfully only one time , as a result the successful reception at vehicle @xmath8 has a geometric distribution with parameter @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is given in equation [ success ] .",
    "also , @xmath24 and @xmath19 represent the channel access probability for the transmitter and the desired receiver respectively .",
    "this parameter demonstrates the probability that the transmitter is sending messages , the desired receiver is obtaining the warnings , and the warning messages are successfully delivered , all simultaneously .",
    "this gives us the number of required slots on average for vehicle @xmath8 to receive vehicle @xmath0 s messages : @xmath25 if sap scheme is employed , we need to alter the equation : @xmath26 in which @xmath27 represents the channel access probability when the time slots are not synchronized and @xmath28 denotes equation [ success ] using the new channel access probabilities .",
    "the allowable number of transmission opportunities within the tolerable delay period is : @xmath29 @xmath30 represents data rate which is chosen from table [ table_data_rate ] while @xmath31 denotes the packet length .",
    "@xmath32 denotes the maximum tolerable delay to inform vehicle @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 denotes the success probability at @xmath33 after @xmath35 transmission opportunities : @xmath36\\right)^d\\label{success_prob }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation demonstrates the dependence of packet success probability on @xmath10 and inter - vehicle distances",
    ".       clearly , it takes longer time for the vehicles far away from @xmath0 to receive the packets due to delay , however , those far vehicles ( for example @xmath8 ) receive the messages notifying about the deceleration of @xmath0 from the vehicles @xmath37 as well .",
    "@xmath38 is not included since @xmath39 can see the brake lights of @xmath38 with no need of vehicle to vehicle communications .",
    "taking all of the above into account , the average delay of reception at vehicle @xmath8 is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 since there is no need for communications between two adjacent vehicles .",
    "we run a recursive algorithm such that the channel access probability at a specific time depends on the collision probability at the previous time .",
    "[ 3dim ] illustrates the collision probability when different channel access probabilities are assigned to unsafe and safe vehicles respectively .",
    "x axis represents the channel access probabilities for safe vehicles , y axis shows the channel access probabilities for unsafe vehicles , and z axis denotes the collision probabilities . assuming equal transmission probabilities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : equal ] ) , the minimum number of collisions happens at around @xmath42 .",
    "however , 25% reduction in collision probability can be achieved when unsafe and safe vehicles transmit more and less than @xmath43 respectively . in other words , the minimum collision probability in fig .",
    "[ 3dim ] is located in a value greater than @xmath43 on y axis and less than @xmath43 on x axis .",
    "note that we are comparing this customized communications ( fig .",
    "[ 3dim ] ) to the communications with equal channel access probability in its optimal range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : equal ] ) . with this simulation ,",
    "it becomes clear that the driver - based adaptation of communications used in warning systems has a noticeable advantage over these systems employing the same optimal channel access probabilities for all the vehicles and therefore has a huge advantage over the currently used warning systems .",
