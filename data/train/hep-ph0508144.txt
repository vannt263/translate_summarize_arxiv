    "the properties of the @xmath7 mesons are of special interest , since they are the only quarkonia consisting of two heavy quarks with different flavours and are also intermediate to the charmonium and bottomonium systems . additionally ,",
    "because they carry flavour they can not annihilate into gluons so are more stable with widths less than a hundred @xmath11 excited @xmath7 meson states lying below @xmath12 ( and @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) threshold can only undergo hadronic ( pionic ) or radiative transitions to the ground pseudoscalar state which then decays weakly .",
    "this results in a rich spectroscopy of narrow radial and orbital excitations which are considerably more stable than their charmonium and bottomonium analogues .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath7 meson by the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) collaboration [ 1 ]  in @xmath15collisions at @xmath16 @xmath17 with an observed pseudoscalar mass @xmath18 @xmath19 has inspired new theoretical interest in the study of the @xmath7 spectroscopy in the framework of heavy quarkonium theory [ 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 ] .",
    "on the other hand , for bottomonium system , the aleph collaboration in 2002 has searched for the pseudoscalar bottomonium meson , @xmath20 in two - photon interactions at lep2 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath21 pb@xmath22 collected at @xmath23 centre - of mass energies from @xmath24 @xmath25 to 209 @xmath26 one candidate event is found in the six - charged - particle final state and none in the four - charged - particle final state .",
    "the candidate @xmath27 ) ( @xmath28 ) has reconstructed invariant mass of @xmath29 @xmath19 [ 16]@xmath30 theoretical estimates ( from perturbative qcd and lattice nonrelativistic qcd ) to the hyperfine mass splitting for the @xmath31 bottomonium state @xmath32 are reported ( cf .",
    "[ 16 ] and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the inconsistent crystal ball measurement for the pseudoscalar charmonium mass , @xmath33 @xmath4 [ 17 ] has been given for more than 20 years , before a new measurement of @xmath34 @xmath4 was available by belle collaboration in summer of 2002 [ 18 ] for the exclusive @xmath35 decays .",
    "it is close to the @xmath36 mass observed by the same group in the experiment @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xmath4 was found [ 19 ] .",
    "it is giving rise to a small hyperfine splitting for the @xmath39 charmonium state , @xmath40exp)@xmath41 @xmath4 [ 20]@xmath30    very recently , several more new measurements have been appeared that support the belle value : babar measures @xmath42 @xmath4 [ 21 ] ( an earlier analysis resulted in @xmath43 @xmath4 [ 22 ] ) , cleo ii gives @xmath44 @xmath4 [ 23 ] ( cleo iii prelim : @xmath45 @xmath46 and a different belle analysis yields @xmath47 @xmath4 [ 24 ] .",
    "the @xmath48 splitting calculated from a naive average of the central values of all measurements except crystal ball is @xmath49 @xmath4 ) .",
    "further , the following mass values have been obtained : @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 the relative measurement accuracy reached @xmath54 for the @xmath55 @xmath56 for the @xmath57 and is approximately 3 times better than that of the previous precise experiments in [ 25 ] and [ 26 ] . the new result for the mass difference",
    "is @xmath58 @xmath4 [ 2]@xmath30    consequently , such observations of hyperfine splittings for the @xmath39 charmonium and @xmath31 bottomonium spectra have inspired new theoretical interest in the study of the hyperfine splittings of the charmonium and bottomonium states as well as their spectra [ 5,14,27,28,29 ] .",
    "badalian and bakker [ 27 ] calculated the hyperfine splitting for the @xmath39 charmonium state , @xmath59theory)@xmath60 @xmath61 in their recent work .",
    "recksiegel and sumino developed a new formalism [ 28 ] based on improved perturbative qcd approach to compute the fine and hyperfine splittings of charmonium and bottomonium [ 28,29 ] .",
    "as a result , one is able to test the validity of the conventional phenomenological potential models where the core potential follow from simple ansatzes by comparing our theoretical predictions of the spectrum of heavy quarkonia in terms of agreement with the experimental data with respect to the estimated uncertainties . thus , these phenomenological potential models are not a priori connected to a fundamental qcd parameters [ 4,5,6,7,8 ] . in general , where the masses of bottomonium and charmonium states have been measured , the experimental uncertainties are much smaller than the theoretical uncertainties [ 20 ] .",
    "the only two exceptions are the very poorly measured masses of @xmath62 and @xmath63 with suitable potential model , very good agreement with the observed spectra can be obtained for the charmonium and bottomonium states ( e.g. , [ 15 ] ) .",
    "these studies established the non - relativistic nature of the heavy quarkonium systems and , in overall , a unified shape of the inter - quark potential in the distance region @xmath64 @xmath65    in this work we extend our previous analysis of the shifted large-@xmath66 expansion technique ( slnet ) developed for the schrdinger wave equation @xmath67 $ ] and then applied to semirelativistic and relativistic wave equations [ 5,32,33 ] to reproduce the hyperfine splittings of the @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath68 spectra using a recently proposed phenomenological potential [ 15 ] .",
    "the calculations of the bottomonium hyperfine splittings constitute predictions of the yet unobserved states .",
    "the motivation of the present work is to give a detailed analysis of mass spectra and decay widths for @xmath1 @xmath69 and @xmath7 systems using a recently proposed phenomenological potential form [ 15 ] .",
    "we also calculate the masses of the recently found new charmonium @xmath36 and the searched bottomonium @xmath62 mesons together with the hyperfine splittings of their states .",
    "the outline of this paper is as following : in section ii , we first review briefly the analytic solution of the schrdinger equation for unequal mass case @xmath70 .",
    "section iii is devoted for the spin - averaged quarkonium masses of spin triplet states .",
    "the leptonic decay widths are briefly reviewed in section iv . finally , section v contains our conclusions .",
    "we limit our discussion to the following generality of potentials [ 5,15,34 ] :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 are nonnegative constants whereas @xmath76 is taking any sign .",
    "these static quarkonium potentials are monotone nondecreasing , and concave functions satisfying the condition [ 4,5,30,32,33 ]    @xmath77    at least ten potentials of this generality , but with various values of the parameters , have been proposed in the literature .",
    "cornell potential has @xmath78 lichtenberg potential has @xmath79 song - lin potential has @xmath80 and the logarithmic potential of quigg and rosner corresponds to @xmath81 have been recently studied ( cf .",

    "the song s potential used in [ 34 ] has @xmath82 potentials with @xmath83 have also been popular .",

    "recently , motyka and zalewski [ 15 ] have also explored the quality of fit in the region @xmath90 @xmath91 of the @xmath92 plane .",
    "they choose the region with coordinates @xmath93 .    in the present work , in order to get a good fit , we test the second generality ( 1 ) with @xmath94 therefore , the nonrelativistic phenomenological potential used by motyka and zelawiski [ 15 ] for the @xmath95 and @xmath96 systems has the form    @xmath97    where @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 are all in units of @xmath101 consequently , as @xmath102 this potential has the @xmath100 dependence corresponding to one gluon exchange . the expected part of the potential which is linear in @xmath103 is not seen .",
    "probably the bottomonia are too small to reach sufficiently far into the asymptotic region of linear confinement .",
    "perhaps a more flexible potential would exhibit the linear part , but one may be observing an effect of the expected screening of the interaction between the heavy quarks by the light sea quarks [ 15 ] .",
    "the corresponding potential ( 3 ) is very reasonable ( cf .",
    "e.g. , [ 15 ] ) .",
    "the quark massese are    @xmath104    for the @xmath68 quarkonium we use the reduced mass    @xmath105    we follow ref.[15 ] in choosing the centers of gravity of the triplets for the practical reasons that the masses of the spin singlets for the @xmath6 quarkonium are not known or very poorly measured .    for two particles system",

    "if @xmath108 denotes the schrdinger s wave function , a separation of variables @xmath109 gives the following radial schrdinger equation ( @xmath110 [ 4,6,30,31,32 ]    @xmath111[% \\overline{k}-(3-a)]}{16\\mu r^{2}}+v(r)\\right\\ } u(r)=e_{n , l}u(r),\\ ] ]    with @xmath112 is the reduced mass for the two quarkonium composite particles .",

    "once @xmath122 is found via equation ( 16 ) , then the schrdinger binding energy of the @xmath96 system in ( 14 ) becomes relatively simple and straightforward .",
    "hence , the bound state mass of the @xmath96 system is written as    @xmath139    where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the masses of the quark and antiquark , respectively .",
    "the expansion parameter @xmath117 or @xmath118 becomes smaller as @xmath116 becomes larger since the parameter @xmath142 is proportional to @xmath138 which it appears in the denominator in higher - order correction .",
    "since the systems  that we investigate in the present work are often considered as nonrelativistic system , then our treatment is based upon schrdinger equation with a hamiltonian @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the spin - dependent term . the spin dependent correction to the nonrelativistic hamiltonian , which is responsible for the hyperfine splitting of the mass levels ,",
    "is generally used in the form [ 7,8,39,40,41,42 ]    @xmath145    adapted from the breit - fermi hamiltonian .",
    "the number @xmath146 substituted from the product of the spins corresponds to the recent assumption that the unperturbed nonrelativistic hamiltonian gives the energy of the triplet states . since for the states with orbital angular momentum @xmath147 the wave function",
    "vanishes at the origin , the shift effect only the @xmath148 states .",
    "thus , the only first order effect of this perturbation is to shift the @xmath149 states down in energy by    @xmath150    with the wave function at the origin is calculated by using the expectation value of the potential derivative via [ 4,5,6,30,42,43 ]    @xmath151    in order to apply the last formula one needs the value of the wavefunction at the origin - this is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with the nonrelativistic hamiltonian and the coupling constant . in this approach , the qcd strong coupling constant",
    "@xmath152on the renormalization point @xmath153 is not an independent parameter .",
    "it can be connected ( in the @xmath154 renormalization scheme ) through the two - loop relation [ 10,15 ] @xmath155 } \\ ] ] where @xmath156 like most authors ( cf .",
    "e.g. [ 4,5,6,7,8,15 ] ) , the strong coupling constant @xmath157 is fitted to the experimental charmonium hyperfine splitting number @xmath158exp@xmath159 @xmath160 [ 4,20 ] yields    @xmath161    knowing the coupling at the scale @xmath162 we obtain the couplings at other scales as follows . the number of flavours @xmath163 is put equal to three for @xmath164 ( we are not interested in the region @xmath165 equal to four for @xmath166 @xmath167 and equal to five for @xmath168 @xmath169 ( we are not interested in the region @xmath168",
    "@xmath170 then the value of  @xmath171 from ( 22 ) is used to calculate @xmath172 and @xmath173 using the known value of @xmath174 and the formula form ( 22 ) we find the value    @xmath175    from this the value of @xmath176 is found .",
    "note that this supports our model since a different choice of the hamiltonian would in general lead to a different value of the wave function at the origin and to a different determination of @xmath157 from the same hyperfine splitting .",
    "then the estimate of @xmath177 would , of course , be also different . for the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath3 quarkonium we use the coupling constant    @xmath178    so",
    "that in each case the scale is twice the reduced mass of the quark - antiquark system .",
    "the calculated quarkonium masses together with hyperfine splittings are given in tables 1 - 3 .",
    "the hyperfine mass splittings of @xmath5 and @xmath6 predicted by the potential model is listed with some other models in table 4 .",
    "therefore , as for the hyperfine splittings in table 4 , all of the potential model calculations try to reproduce the old experimental values , while the lattice calculations and perturbative qcd favor the new values .",
    "no confirmed experimental data to check these predictions are available yet .",
    "let us note , however , that the unconfirmed experimental splitting of the @xmath179 level @xmath180 @xmath160- is much bigger / lower than expected from the potential models . in all cases , where comparison with the other models are significantly smaller than the splittings found by eichten and quigg [ 7 ] and similar to , but usually a little smaller than , the splittings calculated by gupta and johnson [ 44 ] .",
    "one can also try to compare our results with more ambitious approaches .",
    "a careful analysis in the framework of qcd sum rules [ 45 ] finds the hyperfine splitting of the bottomonium @xmath181theory)@xmath182 @xmath183 the central value agrees to several @xmath4 very well with our expectation , but the uncertainty is too large to distinguish between the potential models . a lattice calculation [ 9 ] gives the hyperfine splitting @xmath181theory)@xmath184 @xmath160 with a large uncertainty .",
    "again the central value is close to our model , but the uncertainty is big enough to be consistent with all the potential models quoted here .",
    "the leading terms in the leptonic decay widths of the heavy quarkonia are proportional to the squares of the wave functions at the origin .",
    "therefore , they are significant only for the @xmath185 states . for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarkonium systems , we shall consider the decays of the @xmath186 ( vector ) states into pairs of charge conjugated charged leptons , e.g. for definiteness into @xmath23 pairs .",
    "for the @xmath68 quarkonium we consider the decays of the @xmath187 ( pseudoscalar ) states into @xmath188 pairs .",
    "since the probability of such decays contains as a factor the square of the lepton mass , the decays into lighter leptons are much less probable .",
    "the decay widths of the vector @xmath5 and @xmath2 quarkonium systems into charged lepton pairs are usually calculated from the qcd corrected van royen - weiskopf formula [ 46 ]    @xmath189    for vector mesons containing light quarks this formula leads to paradoxes ( cf .",
    "[ 47 ] and references therein ) . for quarkonia , however , the main problem seems to be the qcd correction .",
    "thus , in order to get quantitative predictions it is necessary to include higher order corrections which are not known . in order to estimate the missing terms we tried two simple forms .",
    "exponentialization of the first correction    @xmath190    and padeization    @xmath191    we use the average of these two estimates as our estimate of the qcd correction factor extended to higher orders .",
    "the difference between @xmath192 and @xmath193 is our crude evaluation of the uncertainty of this estimate .",
    "the resulting leptonic widths are collected in table 5 .",
    "further , we have the relation    @xmath194    where @xmath195 is the averaged qcd correction factor . with our choice of parameters",
    "this formula reduces to    @xmath196    with @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "the formula for the leptonic widths of the pseudoscalar @xmath68 quarkonium reads    @xmath199    where @xmath200 is the fermi constant , @xmath201 is the element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - masakawa matrix and the decay constant @xmath202 is given by the formula ( cf .",
    "e.g. [ 48 ] )    @xmath203    where @xmath204 is qcd correction factor .",
    "formally this decay constant is defined in terms of the element of the axial weak current    @xmath205    the qcd correction factor is [ 48 ]    @xmath206 .\\ ] ]    with our parameters @xmath207 and since this is rather close to unity , we use it without trying to estimate the higher order terms .    substituting the numbers one finds the decay widths given in table 5 .",
    "the corresponding decay constants for the ground state and for the first excited @xmath208state of the @xmath68 quarkonium are found to be @xmath209 @xmath4 and @xmath210 @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "e.g. , [ 6 ] .",
    "let us note the convenient relation    @xmath211    which for our values of the parameters yields    @xmath212    where all the parameters are in suitable powers of @xmath213",
    "figure1 shows the behavior of the present potential form in comparison with some other potential forms considered in [ 4 ] . from this figure",
    "it is noticed that , all potential forms are nearly the same at large @xmath214 but the behavior seem different at very small @xmath103 ( @xmath215 @xmath216 about @xmath217 @xmath218 due to the variation of the one - gluon exchange term in each potential model .",
    "further , the present potential model containing six free parameters : the three parameters in the strictly nonrelativistic phenomenological potential ( 3 ) , the masses of the @xmath219 and @xmath220 quarks ( 4 ) and the strong coupling constant at the @xmath221 scale ( 22 ) .",
    "this model is applicable to all heavy quarkonia below their strong decay thresholds .",
    "consequently , we obtain the @xmath222 and @xmath223 quarkonium mass spectra and also their leptonic decay widths in good agreement with up - to - date experimental findings .",
    "we also give prediction for the @xmath68 quarkonium masses and also for the leptonic widths of the pseudoscalar @xmath68 quarkonium .",
    "our model predicts similar hyperfine splitting for the @xmath31 bottomonium and @xmath224 charmonium as in the other potential models [ 7,15 ] , lattice [ 49,50 ] and perturbation qcd [ 28,29,51 ] .",
    "further , the fine splitting in charmonium is found to be @xmath225 @xmath226    finally , in general , the potential models reproduce the experimental values much better",
