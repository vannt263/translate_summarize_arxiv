    "functionally graded materials ( fgm ) were first invented by a group of japanese scientists @xcite and have been since then widely used in smart structures for the active vibration control @xcite .",
    "such smart structures in form of plates or shells are quite often made of the functionally graded piezoelectric ( fgp ) materials whose electroelastic moduli vary through the thickness @xcite .",
    "if oscillating voltages , as external excitations , are controlled on electrodes covering faces or boundaries of such structures , then , under certain conditions , the structures may exhibit anti - resonant regime that can be used to eliminate unwanted vibrations @xcite .",
    "mention that , from the formal mathematical point of view , smart sandwich structures with piezo patches bonded to elastic layers @xcite also belong to the fgp - structures with piecewise constant electroelastic moduli .    due to the above mentioned inhomogeneous material properties of fgp - structures , the problems of their equilibrium and vibration admit exact analytical solutions of the three - dimensional theory of piezoelectricity only in a few exceptional cases ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) . by this reason",
    "different approaches have been developed depending on the type of the structures .",
    "if fgp - plates and shells are thick , no accurate two - dimensional theory can be constructed , so only the numerical methods or semi - analytical methods applied to three - dimensional theory of piezoelectricity make sense @xcite . however ,",
    "if fgp - plates and shells are thin , the reduction from the three- to two - dimensional theory is possible and different approximations can be constructed . up to now",
    "two main approaches have been developed : ( i ) the variational approach based on hamilton s variational principle and on some ad - hoc assumptions generalizing kirchhoff - love s hypothesis to fgp - plates and shells @xcite , ( ii ) the asymptotic approach based on the analysis of the three - dimensional equations of piezoelectricity , mainly for the laminated fgp - plates @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the variational approach is the necessity of having an ansatz for the displacements and electric field that is difficult to be justified , while simplicity and brevity are its advantages .",
    "the asymptotic method needs no a priori assumptions ; however , the direct asymptotic analysis of the 3-d differential equations of piezoelectricity is very cumbersome .",
    "the synthesis of these two approaches , called the variational - asymptotic method , first proposed by @xcite and developed further by @xcite , seems to avoid the disadvantages of both approaches described above and proved to be quite effective in constructing approximate equations for thin - walled structures .",
    "note that this method has been applied , among others , to derive the 2-d theory of homogeneous piezoelectric shells by @xcite , the 2-d static theory of purely elastic sandwich plates and shells by @xcite , the theory of smart beams by @xcite , the theory of low- and high frequency vibration of laminate composite shells by @xcite , and just recently , the theory of smart sandwich shells by @xcite .",
    "note also the closely related method of gamma convergence used in homogenization of periodic and random microstructures @xcite and dimension reduction of plate theories @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct the rigorous first order approximate two - dimensional fgp - shell theory by the variational - asymptotic method .",
    "we consider the fgp - shell whose electroelastic moduli vary in the thickness direction .",
    "the dimension reduction is based on the asymptotic analysis of the action functional containing small parameters that enables one to find the distribution of the displacements and electric field from the solution of the so - called thickness problem . using the generalized prager - synge identity for the inhomogeneous piezoelectric body ,",
    "we provide also the error estimation of the constructed theory in the energetic norm .",
    "we apply this theory to the problem of forced vibration of a functionally graded piezoceramic cylindrical shell with thickness polarization fully covered by electrodes and excited by a harmonic voltage .",
    "the exact analytical solution to this problem is found .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this short introduction the variational formulation of the problem is given in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "sections 4,5 are devoted to the asymptotic analysis of the action functional . in section 6 the two - dimensional theory of fgp - shells is obtained .",
    "section 7 provides the error estimation of the constructed theory .",
    "section 8 presents the exact analytical solution to the problem of forced vibration of a circular cylindrical fgp - shell . finally , section 9 concludes the paper .",
    "let @xmath0 be a domain of the three - dimensional euclidean space occupied by a linear and inhomogeneous piezoelectric body in its stress - free undeformed state . a motion of this body is completely determined by two fields , namely , the displacement field @xmath1 , and the electric potential @xmath2 . for simplicity we will consider the case of purely electrical loading on the body , which corresponds to specifying the value of the electric potential on the electrodes .",
    "let the boundary of the body , @xmath3 , be decomposed into @xmath4 two - dimensional surfaces @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . the subboundaries @xmath7 are covered by electrodes .",
    "we assume that the electrodes are infinitely thin so that their kinetic and electroelastic energies can be neglected compared with those of the body . on these electrodes the electric potential",
    "is prescribed @xmath8 hamilton s variational principle of piezoelectricity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) states that the true displacement @xmath9 and electric potential @xmath10 of an inhomogeneous piezoelectric body change in space and time in such a way that the action functional @xmath11=\\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\\int_{\\mathcal{v}}[t(\\mathbf{x},\\dot{\\mathbf{w}})-w(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon } , \\mathbf{e})]\\ , dv \\ , dt\\ ] ] becomes stationary among all continuously differentiable functions @xmath12 and @xmath2 satisfying the initial and end conditions @xmath13 as well as constraints .",
    "the integrand in the action functional is called lagrangian , while @xmath14 is the volume element and the dot over quantities denotes the partial time derivative . in the lagrangian",

    "we analyze the forced vibration of the shell made of a functionally graded piezoelectric material .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the face surfaces of the shell corresponding to @xmath51 in the above equation .",
    "we consider three methods of electrode arrangement encountered most often :    * there are no electrodes on the face surfaces of the shell ( unelectroded face surfaces ) .",
    "the edge of the shell is partially electroded ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",

    "the face surfaces of the shell are only partially coated by electrodes on @xmath58 .",
    "the remaining face surfaces @xmath59 are uncoated .",
    "this case can be regarded as the mixed situation of the two cases above .    for the asymptotic analysis of the fgp - shell inhomogeneous in the normal direction it is convenient to use the curvilinear",
    "coordinates @xmath60 introduced above and the co- and contravariant index notation for vectors and tensors , with einstein s summation convention being employed . in this coordinate system",

    "the possibility of reduction of the three- to the two - dimensional functional is related to the smallness of the ratios between the thickness @xmath39 and the characteristic radius of curvature @xmath76 of the shell middle surface and between @xmath39 and the characteristic scale of change of the electroelastic state in the longitudinal directions @xmath77 ( see @xcite and section 5 ) .",

    "this means that we consider in this paper only statics or low - frequency vibrations of the functionally graded piezoelectric shell . by using the variational - asymptotic method , the two - dimensional action functional",
    "will be constructed below in which terms of the order @xmath84 and @xmath85 are neglected as compared with unity ( the first - order or `` classical '' approximation ) .    in order to fix the domain of the transverse co - ordinate in the passage to the limit @xmath86 , we introduce the dimensionless co - ordinate @xmath87,\\ ] ] and transform the action functional to @xmath88 \\kappa \\ , d\\zeta \\ , da\\ , dt,\\ ] ]",

    "before applying the variational - asymptotic procedure to functional let us transform the electric enthalpy density to another form more convenient for the asymptotic analysis @xcite .",
    "we note that , among terms of @xmath97 , the derivatives @xmath98 and @xmath99 in @xmath100 and @xmath101 as well as @xmath102 are the main ones in the asymptotic sense .",
    "therefore it is convenient to single out the components @xmath100 and @xmath101 as well as @xmath103 in the electric enthalpy density .",
    "we represent the latter as the sum of two quadratic forms @xmath104 and @xmath105 corresponding to longitudinal and transverse electric enthalpy densities , respectively .",
    "these are defined by @xmath106 let us first find the decomposition in the most general case of anisotropy @xcite .",
    "long , but otherwise simple calculations show that @xmath107 where @xmath108 functions @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 can be regarded as components of surface tensors referred to the basis vectors @xmath124 of the middle surface . we shall call them `` two - dimensional '' electroelastic moduli .",
    "they are evaluated in terms of the three - dimensional moduli by means of the formulas @xmath125 where their dependence on the variable @xmath95 is suppressed for short .",
    "note that , as these tensors are referred to the basis @xmath126 , their components will depend on @xmath95 through the shifter @xmath127 even for homogeneous shells .",
    "however , it can be shown for the fgp - shell inhomogeneous in the normal direction that components of two - dimensional electroelastic moduli of any rank , denoted symbolically by @xmath128 , possess the property @xmath129 where @xmath130 describe the _ physical _ inhomogeneity of the material and do not depend on the shifter ( as in the case of fgp - plates with cartesian coordinates ) , while the factor @xmath131 in the second term is due to the shifter @xmath132 of the curvilinear coordinates solely . therefore , when constructing 2-d shell theories having the error @xmath84 as compared with unity , it can be assumed that @xmath133 .",
    "let us note certain special symmetry cases .",
    "* _ mirror planes parallel to the middle surface_. if properties of the piezoelectric material are invariant under reflections relative to planes parallel to the middle surface , then the following 2-d tensors vanish @xmath134 and @xmath135 * _ n - fold rotation axes that coincide with the normal to the middle surface_. when @xmath136 is even , all 2-d tensors of odd rank vanish @xmath137 * _ transverse isotropy_. when properties of the piezoelectric material are invariant under rotations about the normal to the middle surface ( model of a piezoceramic shell polarized along the normal with symmetry @xmath138 ) , it can be shown that all 2-d tensors of odd rank vanish ; the tensor @xmath139 has the form @xmath140 and all the 2-d tensors of second rank are spherical .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the low frequency vibrations of the fgp - shell for which assumption is valid . based on this assumption",
    "we may neglect the kinetic energy density in the variational - asymptotic procedure .",
    "since there are two different cases of unelectroded and electroded faces of the shell , we shall do the asymptotic analysis for these cases separately .",
    "we could start the variational - asymptotic procedure with the determination of the set @xmath141 according to its general scheme @xcite . as a result",
    ", it would turn out that , at the first step , the functions @xmath142 and @xmath82 do not depend on the transverse co - ordinate @xmath95 : @xmath143 , @xmath144 ; at the second step the function @xmath145 is a linear function of @xmath95 ; and at the next step @xmath146 and @xmath147 are completely determined through @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath141 according to the variational - asymptotic scheme consists of functions @xmath150 and @xmath151",
    ". we will pass over these long , but otherwise standard , deliberations and make a change of unknown functions immediately .",

    "asymptotic analysis enables one to determine the order of smallness of @xmath165 .",
    "if these terms are neglected , then is a generalization of the well - known kirchhoff - love hypotheses to a piezoelectric shell .",
    "the electroelastic state of a shell is then characterized by the measures of extension @xmath166 , the measures of bending @xmath167 and , finally , the surface electric field @xmath168 .",
    "we introduce the following notation @xmath169 consider a certain point of the middle surface @xmath37 .",
    "the best constant @xmath77 in the inequalities @xmath170 is called the characteristic scale of change of the electroelastic state in the longitudinal directions .",
