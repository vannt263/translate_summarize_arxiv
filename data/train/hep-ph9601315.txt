    "we have recently proposed a qcd based parton model for the cumulative phenomena in the interactions with nuclei [ 1 ] . in the model quark diagrams are summed in the vicinity of all intermediate thresholds at which some quarks of the nucleus ( `` donors '' ) transfer all their longitudinal momenta to the distinguished active quark and become soft .",
    "particle production proceeds in the model via two different mechanisms , the direct and spectator ones , schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 @xmath1 .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the simpler direct mechanism leads to the same @xmath2 dependence of the production rate @xmath3 as for the structure function @xmath4 in the region @xmath0 .",
    "it is roughly an exponential in @xmath2 i_d(x)~f_2(x)~(-b_0x ) where the slope @xmath5 is determined by the qcd coupling constant and quark mass .",
    "the spectator mechanism besides involves interactions between partons of the projectile and target nucleus .",
    "it was shown in [ 1 ] that each donor quark has to interact with the projectile . as a result the spectator contribution @xmath6 also behaves in @xmath2 as an exponential but with a different slope i_s(x)~(-b_sx ) the slope @xmath7 depending not only on the qcd coupling constant and quark mass but also on the partonic amplitude . with a particular parametrization for the latter chosen in [ 1 ] the slope @xmath7 was found to be somewhat larger than @xmath5 , so that the spectator contribution resulted smaller than the direct one .",
    "then the total particle production rate behaves in @xmath2 exactly as the structure function . at the time when the paper [ 1 ] was written there",
    "existed no reliable data on the cumulative structure functions except the old data on the deuterium at low energies and not really in the deep inelastic region [ 2 ] .",
    "these deuterium data had the slope in @xmath2 much steeper than particle production data from [ 3,4 ] . assuming the direct mechanism for particle production this resulted in very different values for the effective coupling constant found in [ 1 ] for the two cumulative phenomena",
    "in view of a preliminary character of the deuterium data we preferred not to pursue this point any further in [ 1 ] .",
    "however recently a new set of data on the structure function of @xmath8 in the region @xmath9 was published [ 5 ] , which essentially agrees with the @xmath2 dependence observed on the deuterium in [ 2 ] .",
    "thus it seems to be confirmed that the structure function and particle production have different @xmath2 dependence in the cumulative region .",
    "the slope @xmath5 as observed in [ 2 ] and [ 5 ] is roughly 16 , whereas the slope @xmath10 of the particle production rate is of the order 6@xmath118 [ 3,4 ] .",
    "this circumstance gives us a motivation to reconsider our study of the cumulative phenomena in the light of the experimental evidence for two different exponentials for the structure function and particle production . in the framework of our model",
    "it means that it is the spectator mechanism that gives the bulk of particle production .    in this note",
    "we first demonstrate that final state interactions , not taken into account in [ 1 ] , cancel the leading terms in the direct contribution , so that it becomes much less than the spectator one .",
    "then particle production in the cumulative region indeed goes predominantly via the spectator mechanism . to be able to explain the experimental slope we study a wider class of parametrizations for the partonic amplitude than in [ 1 ] . the spectator slope @xmath7 results very sensitive to the magnitude of the hadronic diffractive cross - sections . the parametrization used in [ 1 ] , which lead to a rather large value for @xmath12 , corresponded to a zero diffractive cross - section .",
    "raising the ratio of the diffractive to elastic cross - section up to 1.5 results in lowering @xmath7 down to 7@xmath119 , not very far from the experimentally observed value 6@xmath118 .",
    "however it does not seem possible to push @xmath7 still further down without entering into a serious conflict with the data on hadronic cross - sections .",
    "note that a more phenomenological attempt to explain smaller slopes for the cumulative particle production is made in [ 6 ] , where the existence of multiquark clusters in the nucleus and their properties are postulated and the quark - gluon string model formalism of [ 7 ] is used to calculate production rates .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we show how the leading terms in the direct contribution are cancelled by final state interactions . in sec .",
    "3 the partonic amplitude is related to the hadronic one and the data on hadronic cross - sections are used to study its possible parametrizations . in sec .",
    "4 we calculate the particle production rate by the spectator mechanism and compare its @xmath2 dependence to that of the structure function and the experimentally observed one .",
    "in the upper blob of fig .  1 @xmath13",
    "the inclusive cross - section off the active quark enters in the triple regge kinematical region , since the scaling variable @xmath2 of the produced particle should be as close as possible to that of the active quark .",
    "therefore we can redraw the diagram of fig .",
    "1 @xmath13 in the form shown in fig .  2 @xmath13 .",
    "however we have also to take into account final state interactions of the produced particle with donor quarks which raise its longitudinal momentum .",
    "an example of these is shown in fig",
    ".  2 @xmath14 .",
    "the diagrams of fig .",
    "2 @xmath13 and @xmath14 are not the only ones which give contribution .",
    "in fact taking a diagram with a certain pattern of interactions with donor quarks one should sum over all places where the two upper reggeons from the triple regge interaction are attached to the active quark .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that this sum vanishes in the limit when the donor quarks loose all their longitudinal momentum .",
    "let the number of donors be @xmath15 .",
    "we denote the momenta of the left active quark @xmath16 before the interaction with the reggeon and @xmath17 after this interaction .",
    "analogous quantities on the right side hereafter will be labelled with tildas ( see fig",
    ".  2 @xmath1 ) .",
    "we use the light - cone variables @xmath18 .",
    "the donor quarks lie on the mass shell between the interactions .",
    "so there minus momenta ( `` energies '' ) take on physical values k_i-=(m^2-k_i^2)/2k_i+_i from energy conservation we find for the energies of the active quark _ i-=np_1 - -_n+1^n-1_j -_1^i_j-_i+1^nk_j-^(0 ) ,  i=1,2, ...",
    "l and _i-=_-+_i+1^n(_j - k_j-^(0 ) )  i = l , l+1, ... n-1 where @xmath19 is the total number of partons in the nucleus and @xmath20 are the momenta of the left donors before the interaction .",
    "integrations over @xmath21 can then be done easily , since all singularities coming from the active quark propagators lie on the opposite side of the real axis as compared to the donor propagators . as a result @xmath21",
    "are substituted by @xmath22 in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . in the limit when the donor quarks loose all there longitudinal",
    "momenta @xmath23 become large and from ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) one obtains for the @xmath24th active quark propagator 1/_1^i_j ,  i=1,2, ... l and -1/_i+1^n_j ,  i = l , l+1, ... n-1    now we pass to the triple regge interaction .",
    "the momentum of the upper left reggeon @xmath25 is q=_l-_l so @xmath26 . calculating @xmath27 and @xmath28 we find q^2=-2p_1+(-_1^nx_i)_1^n_i+ ( + _ 1^n-1k_i)_^2 here @xmath29 are the scaling momenta of the donors after the interactions , @xmath30 ; @xmath31 where @xmath2 is the scaling variable of the produced particle .",
    "all scaling variables are defined here relative to the average longitudinal momentum of the initial quarks of the nucleus .",
    "they are three times larger than the standard ones defined relative to the nucleon momentum . at the threshold @xmath32 .",
    "the important thing about ( 9 ) is that @xmath33 does not depend on @xmath34 , that is , on the place at which the reggeon is attached .",
    "however there still remains some dependence on @xmath34 in the energy on which the upper reggeons depend .",
    "in fact the factor corresponding to the triple regge interaction is given by g(t)(s_l_)^(t)(m^2)^(0)-2(t ) ,  t = q^2 here @xmath33 is given by eq .",
    "( 9 ) , @xmath35 is the three - reggeon vertex , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the standard energy variable ; @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the scaling variable of the left active quark at the moment of its interaction with the reggeon and @xmath40 is a similar quantity on the right .",
    "all the three reggeons are taken to be pomerons with the trajectory @xmath41 .",
    "we have also to take into account that the @xmath34th propagator of the active quark is splitted into two by the interaction with the reggeon , which results in an extra factor @xmath42 . introducing it into ( 10 ) we finally obtain for the triple regge interaction factor g(t)s^(0)(_l_)^(t)-1 ( -_1^nx_i)^(0)-2(t )",
    "if we assume weak ( logarithmic ) dependence of the cross - section on energy then we have to take for the effective pomeron intercept @xmath43 .",
    "then the dependence of the expression ( 11 ) on @xmath34 and @xmath44 is also weak ( it enters only through the term @xmath45 with small @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . neglecting this dependence",
    "we find that the triple regge interaction factor does not depend on the place where it is attached and is common to all the diagrams of the type shown in fig .  2 .",
    "then we have only to sum various diagrams forgetting about the common triple regge factor .",
    "diagrams with different @xmath34 ( or / and @xmath44 ) differ only by their active quark propagators . for a given @xmath34",
    "the factor coming from the left active quark propagators is found from ( 7 ) and ( 8) to be _",
    "i=1^l(1/_1^i_j ) _ i = l^n-1(-1/_i+1^n_j ) upon symmetrizing in the soft donors it becomes ( l!(n - l)!)^-1(-1)^n - l_1^n1/_i the sum of ( 13 ) over all @xmath48 evidently gives zero .",
    "thus in the described approximation when the slow change of the triple reggeon interaction with the energy of the active quark is neglected all the diagrams of the type shown in fig .",
    "2 cancel in the sum .",
    "with the bulk of the direct contribution cancelled , particle production in the cumulative region goes predominantly via the spectator mechanism of fig .  1 @xmath14 .",
    "it involves interactions between partons of the projectile and donors from the nucleus , characterized by the partonic amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "we normalize it according to 2 ima(0)=where @xmath49 is the forward amplitude and @xmath50 is the partonic cross - section .",
    "as shown in [ 1 ] each donor parton has to take part in the interaction with the projectile . with @xmath15 donors ,",
    "this gives a factor @xmath51 which is responsible for the difference between the slopes of the structure function and particle production .",
    "the parametrization of @xmath13 and its magnitude thus aquire the decisive role in describing the experimental slope .    of course",
    ", @xmath13 is not the quantity to be directly measured experimentally .",
    "it can however be related to the data through hadronic ( @xmath52 or @xmath53 ) interaction [ 8 ] .",
    "the elastic hadronic amplitude can be represented through partonic interaction as shown in the diagram of fig .",
    "3 . taking the c.m .",
    "system one finds that the longitudinal components @xmath54 of the transferred momenta are small .",
    "also the upper part of the diagram belonging to the projectile does not depend on @xmath55 and the lower , target part does not depend on @xmath56 . integrating over",
    "@xmath54 one then finds that for a diagram with @xmath15 interactions , @xmath57 partons in the projectile and @xmath19 ones in the target the amplitude is given by ia_n^(m ,",
    "n)(q_)=n!c_m^nc_n^n_1^n ( ia(q_i))(2)^2 ^2(q-_1^nq_i)f_n^(m)(q_i ) f_n^(n)(q_i ) here @xmath58 are the @xmath15-fold transverse form - factors for the projectile ( @xmath57 ) and target ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "their fourier transforms give parton distributions in the transverse space @xmath59 .",
    "the amplitude ( 15 ) thus can be presented as an integral in the transverse space ia_n^(m , n)(q_)=n!c_m^nc_n^nd^2b(iqb ) _ 1^n ( d^2b_id^2b_ia(b - b_i+b_i ) ) f_n^(m)(b_i ) f_n^(n)(b_i ) this is only a contribution from given numbers of partons in the projectile and target . summing over @xmath57 and @xmath19 we obtain for the elastic amplitude with @xmath15 partonic interactions ia_n(q_)=(1/n!)d^2b(iqb ) _ 1^n ( d^2b_id^2b_ia(b - b_i+b_i ) )",
    "f_n(b_i ) f_n(b_i ) where for the projectile f_n(b_i)=_mn(m!/(m - n ) ! ) f_n^(m)(b_i ) and similarly for the target .    to move further",
    "one has to make some assumptions about the multiparton distributions @xmath60 .",
    "the simplest one is to assume that partons are completely independent : their number is distributed according to poisson s law and multiparton distributions factorize .",
    "one then obtains f_n(b_1, ...",
    "b_n)=^n_1^n(b_i ) where @xmath61 is the mean number of partons in the projectile or target and the one parton distribution @xmath62 is normalized to unity d^2b(b)=1    putting ( 19 ) into ( 17 ) and summing over @xmath15 one arrives at an eikonal amplitude ia(q_)=d^2b(iqb ) ( ( ip(b))-1 ) where the eikonal factor is p(b)=_p_td^2bd^2b_p(b)_t(b ) a(b - b+b ) and the subscripts @xmath63 and @xmath47 refer to the projectile and target , respectively .",
    "this form of the amplitude coincides with the one found in the multipomeron exchange model with factorizable vertices [ 9 ] .",
    "( 22 ) then gives the contribution of a single pomeron exchange .",
    "one commonly assumes that both @xmath62 and @xmath13 have a gaussian dependence on the impact parameter : _",
    "p , t(r)=(1/r_p , t^2)(-r^2/r_p , t^2 ) ,  a(r)=(i/2r_0 ^ 2)(-r^2/r_0 ^ 2 ) where we have taken @xmath13 pure imaginary , for simplicity .",
    "then one easily finds simple expressions for the eikonal factor , the hadronic total , elastic and inelastic cross - sections and also for the slope of the elastic cross - section @xmath64 : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 b^el=(r^2/2)_2(x)/_1(x ) where @xmath69 is the total interaction radius squared , @xmath70 and the functions @xmath71 are defined by _",
    "n(x)=_k=1^ ( -1)^k-1x^k/(k!k^n )    taking the ratio of any pair of the quantities in ( 24 ) and comparing it to its experimental value one can determine @xmath2 .",
    "then one of eqs .",
    "( 24 ) can be used to find @xmath72 . with",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath72 determined , the cross - section @xmath73 can be found .",
    "values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are more or less known from electromagnetic properties of the projectile and target , thus @xmath76 can also be found .",
    "so , in the end , the only parameters left are the average numbers of partons in the projectile and target @xmath77 and @xmath78 . at low energies",
    "the valence quark approximation seems to be good enough , which implies @xmath79 for @xmath52 or @xmath53 interactions .",
    "this standard procedure was used in [ 1 ] to determine the parameters entering the spectator mechanism . as mentioned , it lead to a relatively small @xmath13 , so that the slope of the spectator spectrum resulted even steeper than that of the structure function",
    ". however , apart from this unsatisfactory result for cumulative production , the discussed parametrization has a more fundamental ( and well - known ) defect .",
    "as one can deduce from the first three equations in ( 24 ) it gives no diffraction .",
    "this property of the pure eikonal amplitude can be easily understood in the framework of the gribov approach to multiple scattering [ 10 ] , where it corresponds to retaining only the initial particle state in the sum over all intermediate states .",
    "a possible remedy consists in changing the eikonal amplitude ( 21 ) by the quasi - eikonal one with a diffraction factor @xmath80 [ 11 ] : ia(q_)=d^2b(iqb)^-1 ( ( ip(b))-1 ) with this factor eqs .",
    "( 24 ) change as follows @xmath81 @xmath82 ^in=^-1r^2_1(2x ) and @xmath64 does not change at all . from ( 27 ) one finds the diffractive cross - section ^dif=(-1)^el so that the new parameter @xmath83 can be directly taken from experiment .    in our partonic approach the quasi - eikonal parametrization ( 26 )",
    "means that instead of ( 19 ) we take f_n(b_1, ... b_n)=^(n-1)/2^n_1^n(b_i ) both for the target and projectile .",
    "the quasi - eikonal parametrization leads to values of @xmath13 considerably larger than without diffraction because of a stronger screening effect introduced by diffractive states ( see table ) . for the maximum value of @xmath84 compatible with the experimental data at @xmath85 it leads to the value of the corresponding parton - nucleon cross - section @xmath86 nearly three times larger than with @xmath87 used in [ 1 ] .",
    "note that the absolute value of @xmath86 then results quite large ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is interesting that values of @xmath86 of a similar order are also favoured by the study of the behaviour of the nuclear structure functions in the opposite kinematical region at small @xmath2 [ 12 ] . in relation to this",
    "we recall that the parton - nucleon cross - section @xmath86 is not a directly observable quantity .",
    "it only enters hadronic cross - sections as a parameter .",
    "the mentioned large value of @xmath86 is consistent with all experimental evidence on proton - proton interactions at @xmath85 .",
    "this large value transforms into the physical value of the @xmath52 cross - section as a result of a strong screening effect , that is , because of a highly coherent manner in which the quarks interact .",
    "with the partonic amplitude fixed in the preceding section , one can calculate the spectator contribution to the cumulative production rate , using the coresponding equations from our paper [ 1 ] ( eqs .",
    "( 38 ) , ( 39 ) and ( 41 ) of [ 1 ] ) , suitably modified to the quasi - eikonal case .",
    "we have also corrected a mistake eliminating @xmath89 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( 39 ) of [ 1 ] .",
    "we have chosen the maximum possible value for the diffractive parameter @xmath90 .",
    "other parameters have been fixed as in [ 1 ] .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown in figs .  4 and 5 for the cumulative charged pion production on deuterium and @xmath91ta , respectively .",
    "for comparison the corresponding nuclear structure function @xmath4 at @xmath0 , calculared in [ 1 ] , is also shown , as well as the available experimental data from [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "one clearly observes that the spectaor mechanism , with a parametrization of the partonic amplitude chosen to account for diffraction , leads to a considerably smaller slope of the production spectra ( @xmath92 , see introduction ) compared to the slope of the structure function in the region @xmath0",
    "( @xmath93 ) , in a good agreement with experimental data .",
    "thus our model correctly predicts two differents exponential in the cumulative production and in the nuclear structure function at @xmath0 .",
