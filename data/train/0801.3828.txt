    "the dynamics of fluid flow in confined geometries has gained renewed interest due to the recent developments in micro- and nanofluidics  @xcite .",
    "the investigations are motivated by important industrial applications including lubrication , coating , and painting processes .",
    "the flow behavior at the sub - micron scale strongly depends on the boundary conditions at the liquid / solid interface .",
    "a number of experimental studies on fluid flow past nonwetting surfaces have shown that the conditions at the boundary deviate from the no - slip assumption  @xcite .",
    "the most popular navier model relates the slip velocity ( the relative velocity of the fluid with respect to the adjacent solid wall ) and the shear rate with the proportionality coefficient , _ the slip length _ , which is determined by the linear extrapolation of the fluid velocity profile to zero .",
    "the magnitude of the slip length depends on several key parameters , such as wettability  @xcite , surface roughness  @xcite , complex fluid structure  @xcite , and shear rate  @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental determination of the slip length as a function of these parameters is hampered by the presence of several factors with competing effects on the wall slip , e.g. surface roughness and wettability  @xcite or surface roughness and shear rate  @xcite .    in recent years , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been widely used to examine the slip flow past atomically smooth , homogeneous surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the md approach is that the velocity profiles and shear stresses are resolved at the molecular level .",
    "the slip length in the shear flow of simple fluids past crystalline walls is a function of the wall - fluid density ratio  @xcite , the relative size of wall atoms and fluid molecules  @xcite , the surface energy  @xcite , and the interfacial shear rate  @xcite .",
    "weak wall - fluid interactions and incommensurable structures of the solid and fluid phases at the interface usually lead to enhancement of slip  @xcite .",
    "if the slip length at low shear rates is about several molecular diameters then it increases with the shear rate , and the slope of the rate dependence is greater for weaker wall - fluid interactions  @xcite .",
    "the rate dependence of the slip length in the flow of polymer melts is more complicated because of the additional length and time scales associated with the dynamics of polymer chains at the interface and the shear thinning viscosity  @xcite .    in the presence of surface roughness  @xcite or chemical",
    "patterning  @xcite , the fluid flow near the solid boundary is perturbed on the length scales of the surface heterogeneities and its description requires definitions of the effective slip length and the average location of the reference plane .",
    "most commonly , the location of the reference plane is defined as the mean height of the surface asperities , and the shear rate is determined by averaging of the fluid flow over the typical length scale of the surface inhomogeneities . in general , the surface roughness is expected to reduce the effective slip length for wetting liquids  @xcite . for sufficiently rough surfaces",
    "the no - slip boundary condition can be achieved even if the local condition is of zero shear stress  @xcite .",
    "however , in special cases , when the fluid is partially dewetted at the nanostructured , or the so - called `` superhydrophobic '' surfaces , the slip length might be enhanced up to a few microns  @xcite .    in recent md studies on shear flow of simple fluids , the behavior of the effective slip length was investigated in the couette cell with either mixed boundary conditions  @xcite or periodic surface roughness  @xcite . in the first study ,",
    "the lower stationary wall with mixed boundary conditions was patterned with a periodic array of stripes representing alternating regions of finite slip and zero shear stress . in the other study  @xcite , the periodically roughened surface was modeled by introducing a sinusoidal offset to the position of the wall atoms . at the wavy wall ,",
    "the local slip length is modified by the presence of curvature and becomes position - dependent along the curved boundary  @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison between continuum analysis and md simulations shows an excellent agreement between the velocity profiles and effective slip lengths when the characteristic length scale of substrate inhomogeneities is larger than approximately thirty molecular diameters  @xcite . in the case of rough surfaces , an additional correction due to variable wall density",
    "was incorporated in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "the problem of applicability of the results obtained for monoatomic fluids to polymer melts is important for modeling polymer flows in confined geometries and design of the hybrid continuum - atomistic algorithms .    in this paper ,",
    "the md simulations are carried out to study the dynamic behavior of the slip length at the interface between a polymer melt and atomically flat or periodically corrugated surfaces .",
    "the md results for flat crystalline walls confirm previous findings  @xcite that the slip length goes through a local minimum at low shear rates and then increases rapidly at higher shear rates . for periodically corrugated surfaces and wetting conditions , the effective slip length decreases gradually with increasing values of the wavenumber .",
    "the solution of the stokes equation with either constant or rate - dependent local slip length is compared with the md simulations for corrugated surfaces with wavelengths ranging from molecular dimensions to values much larger than the radius of gyration of polymer chains . the orientation and the dynamics of linear polymer chains",
    "are significantly affected by surface roughness when the corrugation wavelengths are comparable with the radius of gyration .",

    ", the effective slip length decays monotonically with increasing the corrugation amplitude . for small wavenumbers ,",
    "the effective slip length obtained from the solution of the stokes equation with constant and shear - dependent local slip length is in a good agreement with its values computed from the md simulations , in accordance with the previous analysis for simple fluids  @xcite . at low reynolds numbers , the inertial effects on slip boundary conditions are negligible .",
    "when the corrugation wavelengths are comparable to the radius of gyration , polymer chains stretch in the direction of shear flow above the crests of the surface corrugation , while the chains located in the grooves elongate perpendicular to the flow . in this regime the continuum approach fails to describe accurately the rapid decay of the effective slip length with increasing wavenumber .    financial support from the michigan state university intramural research grants program is gratefully acknowledged .",
