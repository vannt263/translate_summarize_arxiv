    "long duration @xmath1-ray bursts ( lgrb ) derive from the death of very massive star ( e.g. paczynski 1998 ) , they are flashes of cosmic high energy ( @xmath21 @xmath3 gev ) photons ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) and explode in star forming galaxies .",
    "lgrb and their afterglows are associated with broad lined sn ic ( e.g. hjorth et al 2003 , stanek et al 2003 ) .",
    "the analysis of lgrb host galaxy emission lines provides information about star - forming galaxies at high z ( e.g. krhler et al 2015 , blanchard et al 2015 and references therein ) .",
    "the fluxes of significant oxygen lines , a few nitrogen lines as well as   and are available from the surveys at redshifts z@xmath03 .",
    "a few lines appear in the literature at higher z. the strongest lines in the optical range are [ oii]3727 + 3729 ( hereafter [ oii]3727 + ) , [ oiii]5007 + 4959 ( hereafter [ oiii]5007 + ) and [ nii]6584 together with and .",
    "the [ oiii]4363 line , which plays a dominant role in the modelling process , is weak and not always available .",
    "some spectra contain also [ neiii]3869 , [ sii]6717 , [ sii]6731 and seldom he , fe and ar lines ( e.g. hammer et al 2006 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the spectra leads to more or less converging theories about the distribution on z of star formation rates , ages , star masses and temperatures .",
    "the most interesting parameters are related to metallicities , such as the o / h relative abundances , followed by the n / h one .",
    "metallicity is one of the main parameters which affects the evolution of massive stars as well as their explosive deaths ( vergani et al 2011 , piranomonte et al 2015 , sollerman et al 2005 , woosley 1993 , etc ) .",
    "niino et al ( 2016 ) claim that the relation between metallicity and lgrb occurrence rate is not understood quantitatively because , even when the redshifts of the host galaxies are well known , the host galaxy is `` not studied in detail '' .",
    "such a crucial issue , which yields many consequences in a large z range deserves a more precise analysis .    in a previous paper ( contini 2016 ) we presented new results calculated by the detailed modelling of lgrb line ratios and we compared them with those obtained by different investigations , in particular for the element abundances in grb host galaxies at relatively high redshifts .",
    "the emission line spectra emitted from lgrb host galaxies on a large z range were collected from the surveys of krhler et al , savaglio et al ( 2009 ) , sollerman et al ( 2005 ) , castro - tirado et al ( 2001 ) , graham & fruchter ( 2013 ) , levesque et al ( 2010 ) , vergani et al ( 2011 ) , piranomonte et al ( 2015 ) , the lgrb line and continuum spectra with wolf - rayet ( wr ) features from the han et al ( 2010 ) survey .",
    "in particular , the grb 980425 host spectrum ( sollerman et al 2005 ) was selected because the survey refers to relatively low redshift galaxies ( z@xmath4 0.2 ) that host grb .",
    "sollerman et al claim that they are star - forming galaxies with luminosities l@xmath4 and relatively low metallicity .",
    "the spectra include the he i 5876 line which is also significant in sn type 1c hosts relatively to wr stars .",
    "contini ( 2016 , fig . 6",
    "top diagram ) shows the results of o / h and n / h calculated in each of the lgrb hosts by the detailed modelling of the spectra .",
    "o / h is close to solar in most objects . we will conventionally define `` solar '' relative abundances ( o / h)@xmath5=6.6 - 6.7 @xmath610@xmath7 and ( n / h)@xmath5= 9.@xmath6 10@xmath8 ( allen 1976 , grevesse & sauval 1998 ) that were found suitable to local galaxy nebulae .",
    "moreover , these values are included between those of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) ( 8.5@xmath610@xmath7 and 1.12@xmath610@xmath7,respectively ) and asplund et al ( 2009 ) ( 4.9@xmath610@xmath7 and 6.76@xmath610@xmath8 , respectively ) .",
    "regarding nitrogen , we note a large distribution of n / h abundance ratios from solar to lower than solar by a factor @xmath910 in grb hosts . subsolar n / h indicates external gas acquisition through galaxy merging processes .",
    "some observed lgrb hosts , however , show high metallicity .",
    "krler et al ( and references therein ) point out that `` several metal rich grb were discovered '' .",
    "graham et al ( 2015 ) recently confirmed that high metallicities can be found in lgrb .",
    "the near solar o / h relative abundances calculated from the observed line ratios by contini ( 2016 ) in lgrb hosts exceed the o / h values generally obtained by other modelling methods .",
    "in particular at high z , lower than solar o / h in the host gas ( e.g. krhler et al 2015 ) were predicted by modelling the [ oiii]/and [ oii]/line ratios using the strong - line methods ( see sect .",
    "these results are generally obtained by the author majority .",
    "this issue ( see contini 2014 and references therein ) will be explained in the following section .",
    "the number of lgrb galaxy host spectra at relatively low z investigated by contini ( 2016 ) was insufficiently small . in this paper",
    "we try to fill this gap , although by a relatively small number of objects , by modelling in detail the lgrb host spectra presented by niino et al ( 2016 ) at z@xmath0 0.41 .",
    "they explain that the sample number at these redshifts can not be large because the cosmic lgrb rate density is low . on the other hand",
    ", the faint galaxies can be investigated without very deep observations and the host galaxy spectroscopy can give information even when grb afterglows are not bright enough .",
    "in addition , low z grb host galaxies give a hint about the host characteristics in an epoch close to that of local galaxies , connecting low with high z objects .",
    "we will investigate this correlation .",
    "the spectral lines of some galaxies in the niino et al sample were reported by various observers .",
    "they may contain different information in each sample context , therefore we refer to each survey as presented by the observers . for galaxy grb 980425 host niino et al refer to the average spectrum presented by christensen et al ( 2008 ) , who report for this object at z=0.0085 a rich collection of spectra in different locations within the host .",
    "we have the rare occasion to calculate the distribution of the physical quantities throughout a galaxy at redshifts higher than local by modelling each of the observed spectra . moreover , previous spectra presented by hammer et al ( 2006 ) for the grb 980425 sn , wr star and the `` 4 '' regions show many lines which can definitively constrain the models and confirm the presence of the wr stars .",
    "the strongest lines observed in recent years from galaxies at relatively high z are in the optical range .",
    "observations in the infrared ( ir ) are now available e.g. from michalowski et al ( 2016 ) and watson et al ( 2016 ) showing strong [ cii]158 , [ oi]63 in the far - ir ( fir ) and [ siv]10.51 , [ siii]18.71 , [ neiii]15.56 , [ neii]12.81 , etc .",
    "lines in the mid - ir , respectively .",
    "in this paper we will investigate whether the optical lines and the mid - ir and fir lines from the grb 0301203 host galaxy are emitted from clouds of gas in similar physical conditions .",
    "we use for the calculation of the line ratios the code suma which simulates an emitting gaseous cloud within a galaxy hosting an agn or a starburst , heated and ionized by the coupled effect of the primary and secondary photoionization fluxes and shocks .",
    "shocks throughout the host galaxies are the product of star explosions and of cloud collisions by e.g. galaxy merging ( contini 2016 and references therein ) .",
    "the `` detailed modelling '' method is briefly explained and compared with the strong - line methods in sect .",
    "the analysis of niino et al observed line spectra is presented in sect . 3 and those of christensen et al and hammer et al",
    "relatively to the lgrb 980425 host galaxy are investigated in sect .",
    "the optical and ir emission lines observed from lgrb 031203 host are discussed in sect .",
    "5 . concluding remarks follow in sect . 6 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the lines in the optical range from grb 031203 host galaxy were observed and modelled in different ways in the last years ( niino et al and references therein , contini 2016 , etc ) .",
    "we have reproduced the line ratios by the radiation dominated ( rd ) mn3 model ( table 1 ) , characterized by relatively low o / h and n / h and a relatively high .",
    "the model accounts consistently also for the shock .",
    "recently , watson et al ( 2016 ) presented the first mid - ir spectrum of a grb host ( hg031203 ) by low and high resolution spectroscopy with _ spitzer - irs_. watson et al found that the irs spectra show strong high ionization fine structure emission lines such as [ siv ] 10.51which suggest a hard radiation field in the galaxy and therefore strong ongoing star formation and a very young stellar population .",
    "they claim that the absence of pah supports this idea as well as the hot dust peak temperature .",
    "we remind that high ionization lines are strong in presence of the shocks which heat the gas to temperatures @xmath10 ( ) @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , pah grains are very small ( @xmath4 0.01 ) and easily sputtered throughout the shock front .",
    "we refer to the observed [ siv]10.51/[siii]18.71(=1.63 ) and [ neiii]15.56/[neii]12.81(=15.14 ) line ratios . by the code suma line fluxes from far - uv to far - ir",
    "are calculated consistently for each model .",
    "the ir line ratios calculated by model mn3 do not reproduce the observed line ratios . on the other hand , the shock dominated ( sd ) model calculated adopting the same shock input parameters as mn3 but with @xmath12=0 , approximates the data by an error of @xmath13 50% ( [ siv]/[siii]=3.8 and [ neiii]/[neii]= 7 . ) . in this case",
    "the geometrical thickness of the emitting clouds is reduced to @xmath14=1.17@xmath610@xmath15 cm .    to better understand the results , the profiles of the electron temperature and density within the emitting clouds and of the fractional abundances of the h , o , ne and s",
    "ions in different ionization stages are shown in fig . 6 for both the rd ( top diagrams ) and the sd ( bottom diagram ) models .",
    "the rd model corresponds to the case in which the gas moves outwards from the starburst , therefore the photoionizing radiation reaches the edge ( on the right of the right top diagram ) of the cloud opposite to the shock front ( on the left of the left top diagram ) . the emitting cloud corresponding to the rd model",
    "is divided into two halves represented by the left and right top diagrams .",
    "the left diagram shows the region close to the shock front and the distance from the shock front on the x - axis scale is logarithmic .",
    "the right diagram shows the conditions downstream far from the shock front , close to the edge reached by the photoionization flux which is opposite to the shock front .",
    "the distance from the illuminated edge is given by a reverse logarithmic x - axis scale .",
    "the two edges of the cloud are bridged by the secondary radiation from both sides . in the sd case ( bottom diagram ) the gas is collisionally heated by the shock and by secondary radiation emitted by the slabs of gas heated by the shock .",
    "the gas recombines in the downstream region . fig .",
    "6 shows that the optical lines calculated by the mn3 model are emitted from rd clouds moving outwards , while the corresponding mid - ir ones come from cloud fragments which are not reached by the primary radiation flux .",
    "we revisited the line spectra reported by niino et al for galaxies at z @xmath0 0.41 in order to complete by the detailed modelling of the line ratios the calculation of the physical conditions and relative abundances in lgrb host galaxies in the redshift interval 0.0085@xmath0z@xmath40.5 .",
    "our results suggest that the high /ratios ( which reach values as high as 5.5 in some of the observed spectra ) can not originate from high density gas which is not predicted by the observed [ sii ] doublet and by strong forbidden lines in general .",
    "therefore , the line ratios were reddening corrected .",
    "we have found in lgrb host galaxies at z@xmath00.41 lower metallicities than in lgrb hosts at higher z , suggesting that merging is proceeding .",
    "detailed modelling yields higher metallicities than those calculated by the methods in most of the galaxies .",
    "the investigation of different regions throughout the grb 980425 galaxy at z=0.0085 which hosts a wr and a sn , leads christensen et al to claim that extreme values of sfr , stellar masses etc . arise only in the wr region and that the lowest metallicity values are found in the wr and grb regions .",
    "the calculation method of metallicities is still a debated issue and different conclusions can be reached . by the detailed modelling of the line ratios presented in this paper we have added more information to the christensen et al maps about metallicities and physical conditions in the different regions . in particular ,",
    "we have found that the effective starburst temperature in the sn region is the highest throughout the host galaxy .",
    "a low @xmath12 reveals that in the sn region the emitting gas is far from the radiation source in agreement with fynbo et al ( 2000 ) who claim by high spatial resolution imaging , that the grb and the associated sn did not occur in the regions where the wr stars and o stars are located , corresponding to rich and compact clusters of sfr , but several hundreds parsec away .",
    "moreover , our results show that o / h is slightly lower than solar , n / h is lower than solar and s is depleted from the gaseous phase in nearly all the regions throughout the host .",
    "comparison of the pre - shock density map with the /one confirms that high /are due to dust reddening rather than to self absorption by high density gas .",
    "following chevalier ( 1982 ) theory , two shocks are formed after the sn explosion , one propagating towards the sn and one proceeding outward throughout the ism .",
    "we suggest that the line ratios observed by christensen et al in the sn region are emitted downstream of the outward shock front , where the pre - shock density and the shock velocity are suitable to the ism .",
    "region 2.7``@xmath6 -4.0 '' line spectrum ( table 2 ) in the grb 980425 host , which shows an abnormally high [ oii]/[oiii ] line ratio , could be reproduced only by an accretion model , i.e. the emitting gaseous cloud is infalling towards the radiation source .",
    "accretion rather than outflow is supported by michalowski et al in starburst galaxies .",
    "modelling results of [ cii ] 158 and [ oi ] 63 fir line fluxes observed by michalowsky et al in the sn and wr regions are similar in average to those obtained in the other regions of the host galaxy .",
    "the models calculated for the sn and wr regions on the basis of the christensen et al data , were constrained only by a few oxygen , nitrogen and sulphur line ratios to . we have checked them by modelling the line ratios observed by hammer et al .",
    "we have found that the same models reproduce satisfactorily also the heii / and [ ariii]/line ratios .",
    "high temperature stars in the sn region are confirmed .",
    "the modelling of [ siv]10.51/[siii]18.71 and [ neiii]10.6/[neii]12.81 line ratios observed by watson et al from grb 031203 host galaxy at z=0.105 indicates that the mid - ir lines are emitted from geometrically thin shock dominated clouds which are not reached by the starburst photoionizing flux , while the optical lines are emitted from the radiation dominated outflowing clouds .",
    "i am very grateful to the referee for many critical suggestions which substantially improved the presentation of the paper .",
