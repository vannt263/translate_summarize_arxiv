    "two photon collisions at high energy have three theoretical advantages over hadronic collisions or / and deep inelastic scattering :    * the simplicity of the initial state , which allows processes , such as large transverse momentum hadronic jet production , to be calculated exactly to lowest order in perturbative theory . with the advent of high quality experimental data ,",
    "theoretical analysis also focus on higher order corrections to the basic processes which can provide an interesting test of the theory@xcite ; * scattering of two photons with large but equal virtualities gives unique access to bfkl emission @xcite , making this process very useful for studying the dynamics @xcite ; * scattering of two virtual photons with large virtualities allows one to study shadowing ( screening ) corrections on the solid theoretical basis of perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the correct degrees of freedom at high energy are not quarks or gluon but colour dipoles @xcite which have transverse sizes @xmath11 and the fraction of energy @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , two photon interactions occur in two successive steps .",
    "first , each of virtual photon decays into a colour dipole ( quark - antiquark pair ) with size @xmath11 . at large value of virtualities the probability of such a decay",
    "can be calculated in pqcd .",
    "the second stage is the interaction of colour dipoles with each other .",
    "the simple formula ( see for example ref .",

    "we will extend this analysis by using the glauber - mueller approach @xcite with special focus on the impact parameter dependence which was completely omitted in the gbw model as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the dipole - dipole interaction in the born approximation of pqcd .",
    "we show that this approximation leads to @xmath33 which decreases as a power of @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath34 for large @xmath35 and @xmath36 . of course , such a behaviour will not change its character in higher orders of pqcd ( see refs @xcite ) since it is a direct consequence of the massless gluon in qcd . using the born approximation as the example we consider the non - perturbative contribution that provides an exponential decrease at large values of @xmath37 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to glauber - mueller formula in the case of the dglap emission @xcite . here",
    ", we use the advantage of photon - photon scattering with large photon virtualities , since we can calculate the gluon density without uncertainties related to non - perturbative initial distributions in hadronic target .",
    "it is well known that no @xmath0 dependence is induced by dglap emission at least for large values of the impact parameter .",
    "therefore , the entire impact parameter dependence is due to the born approximation cross section . in other words",
    ", we can use our approach as an explicit illustration of the point of view that the non - perturbative large @xmath38 , where @xmath7 is the pion mass , is determined by the initial condition ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) in the contrast with the notion that such a behaviour could change the kernel of the non - linear equation that governs evolution in the saturation region @xcite .",
    "the unitarity bounds as well as different regimes of the energy behaviour of two photon total cross sections are considered in section 4 .    in section 5 we give our estimates for the values of the total cross sections for accessible range of energies .    in the last section",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the born approximation for the dipole - dipole scattering amplitude is shown in .    to obtain the expression for @xmath39",
    "( see ) we need to calculate the diagrams in the momentum representation and than to rewrite them in space - time representations .",
    "the conjugated variables to @xmath40 and @xmath41 will be the size of the dipole ( say @xmath42 and the impact parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the detailed calculation performed in light - cone technique ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the answer is [ ddxs ] ( , r_1 , t , r_2 , t ; b_t ) = _ s^2 ( ) ^2 where @xmath20 is the fraction of the energy of the dipole carried by quarks and @xmath43 .",

    "namely , [ ddxss ] ( , r_1 , t , r_2 , t ; b_t ) = _ s^2 ( ) where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . we note that we do not find the dipole - dipole cross section in impact parameter representation in ref.@xcite , but the calculation is so simple that we just present the answer .",
    "to simplify our further calculations we restrict ourselves by dglap emission assuming that @xmath47 is much smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "it is instructive to find two different limits in .",

    "[ sbex ] ( , r_1 , t , r_2 , t ; b_t)_s^2 . *",

    ". such behaviour can not be correct since it contradicts to the general consequence of analyticity and crossing symmetry of the scattering amplitude .",
    "since the spectrum of hadrons has no particles with mass zero , the scattering amplitude should decrease as @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "certainly we need to take into account non - perturbative corrections to heal this problem as has been noticed in many papers @xcite .",
    "we suggest the procedure how to introduce such corrections which is based on the hadron - parton duality in the spirit of the qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "this procedure consists of two steps : ( i ) first , we rewrite in the momentum transfer representation ( @xmath52 ) in the form of a dispersion relation with respect to the mass of two gluons in @xmath53-channel ; ( ii ) secondly , we claim that this dispersion integral gives correct contribution of all hadronic states on average .",
    "therefore , the model for the non - perturbative contribution is the integral over a two gluon state in the @xmath53-channel but with the restriction that two gluon mass should be larger than the minimum mass in hadronic states , namely , larger than @xmath54 . as in qcd sum rules @xcite",
    "we assume that the integrand at large mass of two gluon state can be found in perturbative qcd , while for small mass we have to include the realistic ( experimental ) spectrum of hadrons .",
    "the integration from @xmath54 means that we believe that we can approximate the dispersion integral even in region of small masses by the perturbative qcd contribution .",
    "this procedure corresponds to the approximation that has been used in ref .",
    ". we can also evaluate this integral differently : to take into account the first resonance ( glueball ) explicitly and to use pqcd approach to estimate the dispersion integral for masses larger than @xmath55 , the value for @xmath55 can be taken from a qcd sum rules calculation of the glueball spectrum @xcite . such an approach is closely related to one developed in ref . @xcite and it appears reasonable in pure gluodynamics where we do not have any pions .",
    "rewriting in the form [ simple ] ( , r_1 , t , r_2 , t ; b_t)= , with obvious notation , we can see that [ qxs ] ( , r_1 , t , r_2 , t;q^2)=c(r_1,t , r_2,t)b_t d b_t = c(r_1,t , r_2,t)k_1(aq ) where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are bessel and mcdonald functions respectively . however , we can rewrite @xmath58 in a different way as [ qxs1 ] qk_1(aq)=. the last integral ( see ) gives as the dispersion relation , namely , [ qxs2 ] ( , r_1 , t , r_2 , t ; t = -q^2)=c(r_1,t , r_2,t ) ^_0 we replace by [ qxs3 ] ( , r_1 , t , r_2 , t ; t = -q^2)=c(r_1,t , r_2,t ) ^_2 m _ ) accordingly to our main idea . returning to the impact parameter representation we obtain",
    "@xmath59 one can see that @xmath60 for @xmath61 due to the asymptotic behaviour of the mcdonald function @xmath62 at large @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 behaviour is : for @xmath63 or / and @xmath64 the dipole - dipole scattering amplitude falls as @xmath65 , but for large @xmath0 ( @xmath66 ) we have normal exponential decrease as @xmath67 which has a non - perturbative origin . gives us a rather general way to take into account the non - perturbative contribution , since in this equation we explicitly introduce the minimum mass in the experimental hadronic spectrum .",
    "however , as we have mentioned above , we can expect a large mass for the low limit of integration in the dispersion relation of and ( @xmath68 ) which will lead to @xmath69 behaviour @xmath70 .",
    "glauber - mueller approach takes into account the interaction of many parton showers with the target as it is shown in    actually this formula was suggested in refs . @xcite but mueller @xcite was the first who proved this formula especially for gluon parton density .",
    "the main idea of this approach is that colour dipole is the correct degree of freedom for high energy scattering .",
    "indeed , the change of the value of the dipole size @xmath11 ( @xmath71 ) during the passage of the colour dipole through the target is proportional to the number of rescatterings ( or the size of the target @xmath72 ) multiplied by the angle @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the energy of the dipole and @xmath75 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath53-channel gluon which is emitted by the fast dipole .",

    "we first discuss the generalization of the born approximation to include the dglap emission ( see ) .",
    "this will give us the correct description of the one parton shower interaction .",
    "the dglap equation looks very simple in the region of low @xmath3 , namely , [ dglap ] = _ s(r^2_1 , t)xg(x , r^2_1,t , r^2_2,t ) , where we consider @xmath77 and rewrite the dglap equation in coordinate space .",
    "we would like to recall that the dglap evolution equation sums the @xmath78 contribution , and therefore , we can safely rewrite it in the coordinate representation since within logarithmic accuracy @xmath79 .",
    "the initial condition for is @xmath80 .",
    "it means that the dipole - dipole cross section at fixed @xmath0 for one parton shower interaction has a form ( [ didixs ] _",

    "the obvious solution is [ soldglap ] xg(x , r^2_1,t , r^2_2,t)=i_0 ( 2 ) where @xmath82    here , in the arguments of the running qcd coupling we have made the simple replacement @xmath83 . within log accuracy",
    "we can not guarantee the coefficient @xmath84 in this expression but as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite this is a reasonable choice ( approximation ) .    has the following asymptotic behaviour [ asbe ] xg(x , r^2_1,t , r^2_2,t ) e^2 which means that @xmath85 grows faster than any power of @xmath86 .",
    "strictly speaking is proven in so called double log approximation of perturbative qcd , in which we consider @xmath87 however , we will use this equation in a wider kinematic region where @xmath88 and @xmath89 while @xmath90 . in this kinematic region",
    "we should use the bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "we view as the limit of the bfkl equation in which we take into account the logarithmic contribution in transverse momentum integration in the bfkl kernel .",
    "the justification for such an approach is the fact that the anomalous dimension of the dglap equation can be parameterized in simple way @xcite [ anpar ] ( ) = _ s(-1 ) the first term in leads to in the region of low @xmath3 .    and solve the problem of one parton shower interaction in the dglap evolution .",
    "it should be stressed that the impact parameter dependence enters only in the born term in .",
    "the explanation of this fact is very simple if we recall that the logarithmic contribution originates from the integration over transverse momenta large @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the momentum transfered along the dglap ladder .",
    "therefore , we have two choices : ( i ) @xmath93 and in this case all logs can be summed in a function with the argument @xmath94 , ( ii ) @xmath95 and in this case we have function of @xmath96 as in . in our problem",
    "we are certainly dealing with the second case since we are mostly interested in large @xmath0 - behaviour of the scattering amplitude which corresponds to low @xmath92 behaviour .",
    "since the colour dipoles are correct degrees of freedom the unitarity constraints are for dipole - dipole elastic amplitude @xmath97 are diagonal and they have the form [ unt ] 2im a_el ( x , r_1,t , r_2,t;b_t ) @xmath98 where @xmath99 stands for contribution of all inelastic processes . is exact for dipole - dipole scattering while it has only limited accuracy , for example , for dipole - proton scattering ( see ref .",
    "an experimental manifestation of the poor accuracy of for deep inelastic scattering is the large cross section of so called inelastic diffraction dissociation of proton in an excited state .    assuming that at high energies the amplitude is pure imaginary , one can find a simple solution to , namely , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the arbitrary real function .    in glauber - mueller approach",
    "the opacity @xmath101 is chosen as [ omega ] ( x , r_1,t , r_2,t;b_t ) = ^ops_dipole(x , r_1,t , r_2,t ; b_t)=^ba_dipole(x , r_1,t , r_2,t ; b_t ) xg(x , r^2_1,t , r^1_2,t ) , where @xmath102 is dipole - dipole cross section in the one parton shower approximation ( see ) .",
    "one can guess that the physical interpretation of glauber - mueller formula is simple , namely , it takes into account many parton shower interactions in dipole - dipole scattering , but it does not include a possibility for produced partons from different parton showers to interact .",
    "these interactions lead to a more complicated non - linear evolution equation ( see refs .",
    "the influence of non - linear evolution on the photon - photon scattering will be discussed in a separate publication ; here we restrict ourselves to consider only the first step of this non - linear evolution which is the glauber - mueller approach .",

    "it is interesting to notice that the value of @xmath112 turns out to be larger at larger value of @xmath153 in the region of low @xmath3 .",

    "the fact that the data with large but equal virtualities are less than our prediction is understandable since in our approach the cross sections for such processes do not have an extra enhancement due to the gluon structure function .    therefore , we can view as an argument that our predictions do not contradict the current experimental data and as the reason for our expectations that future experiments will provide us with data which we will be able to compare with our predictions .",

    "it turns out that because of this behavior the @xmath164 cross section has a wide range of energy where it increases faster than any power of @xmath86 in remarkable contradiction with hadron - hadron and deep inelastic cross sections , which cross sections can have only @xmath186 growth with energy @xcite .",
    "this fast rise of the @xmath164 cross section continue up to energies at which the typical impact parameter ( @xmath112 ) will reach the value of @xmath187 ( @xmath188 , see ) . *",
    "the influence of this power - like @xmath0 behaviour on unitarity bound is studied .",
    "this bound is calculated to give an estimate for the energy behavior of the cross section . *",
    "it is shown that non - perturbative contributions are needed even for the case of photon - photon scattering with large virtualities of both photons in order to describe the large @xmath0-behavior of the dipole - dipole scattering amplitude .",
    "* we found out that the unitarity bound for dipole - dipole cross section for very high energies is @xmath189 .",
    "this result can be translated in the unitarity bound for @xmath164 cross section after integration over @xmath190 and @xmath36 in .",
    "+ for @xmath191 we obtain : @xmath192 + in for transverse polarized photon we used the logarithmic approximation in the integral over @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , @xmath193 and it should be integrated from @xmath194 to @xmath195 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath196 ( ) one can see that + @xmath197 + therefore , only @xmath198 has the same energy dependence of the unitarity bound as hadron -hadron cross section . *",
    "our approach shows that the non - perturbative corrections at large @xmath0 should be taken into account in the born cross section .",
    "another way to treat this result is to say that the non - perturbative corrections can be taken into account only in the initial conditions as was discussed in refs . @xcite .",
    "we do not see that such corrections are needed in the kernel of the non - linear evolution equation @xcite as was argued in refs . @xcite .",
    "+ the estimates at what energies such corrections will enter the game are presented and discussed . *",
