    "in the cb model , long - duration grbs and their ags are produced in core collapse supernovae by jets of highly relativistic `` cannonballs '' that pierce through the supernova shell . the ag the persistent radiation in the direction of an observed grb has three origins : the ejected cbs , the concomitant sn explosion , and the host galaxy .",
    "these components are usually unresolved in the measured `` grb afterglows '' , so that the corresponding light curves and spectra refer to the cumulative energy flux density : @xmath6 the contribution of the candidate host galaxy depends on the angular aperture of the observations and it is usually determined at late times , when the cb and sn contributions have become negligible .",
    "core - collapse supernovae ( sn of types ii / ib / ic ) are far from being standard candles .",
    "but if their explosions are fairly asymmetric as they would be if a fair fraction of them emit two opposite jets of cbs much of the variability could be a reflection of the varying angles from which we see their non - spherically expanding shells . exploiting this possibility to its extreme , we use sn1998bw as an ansatz standard candle ( dado et al .",

    "the selective extinction in our galaxy in the direction of grb 010921 is expected to increase the spectral slope of the observed optical light by @xmath15 .",

    "2001 ; price et al .",
    "this slope is much steeper than the normally observed spectral slopes of grb afterglows : @xmath33 at early time ( the first couple of days ) and @xmath34 later .",
    "we interpret this steepening as the effect of selective extinction in the host galaxy ; a similarlly strong steepening of the spectral index , also consistent with strong extinction in the host galaxy , has been observed in the ag of a few grbs , e.g. , grb 990712 ( bjornsson et al . 2001 ) and grb 000926 ( harrison et al .",
    "supportive evidence for strong extinction in the host galaxy of grb 010921 is provided by the spectral index of its continuum light and by the relative intensity of its measured @xmath35 to @xmath36 emission lines ( price et al .",
    "2002a ) , which is different from the expected intrinsic ratio of 2.87 ( mathis 1983 ) and yields an optical depth at @xmath36 due to dust of 1.51 .",

    "2001a ) , the best - fitted parameters to the ag of grb 011121 are : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . in figs . 1 to 3",
    ", we show the fitted light curves and the observations in the v , r and i bands , assuming a sn1998bw - like contribution at @xmath4 .",
    "the relative intensities were adjusted to fit the early time data .",
    "the difference between the expected intensity ratios for a spectral slope -1.1 and the observed relative intensities were used to correct the sn1998bw contribution for selective extinction in the host galaxy and in the milky way .",
    "the selective extinction in our galaxy and in the host was also used to estimate roughly the overall attenuation normalization : @xmath41 magnitudes in the r band .",
    "the fits are clearly very satisfactory .",
    "the spectral index of the optical ag for most grbs after a couple of days is approximately @xmath42 ( e.g. , simon et al . , 2001 ) . when dominated by a supernova contribution , the optical afterglows of grbs become much more red ( see , e.g. , reichart 1999 ; bloom et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the spectral index of the optical ag of grb 010921 steepened to @xmath43 on day 35 and to @xmath44 on day 46 ( price et al .",
    "2002b ) as expected when the ag is dominated by a supernova like sn1998bw .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "4 and 5 where we compare the colours of sn1998bw at @xmath4 after extinction in the host galaxy and in ours and the colours of the ag of grb 010921 , as measured with hst on days 35 and 46 after burst .",
    "the colours observed by hst are in good agreement with the expectation .",
    "contrary to the questionable and inconclusive fireball - model analysis of the optical afterglow of grb 010921 , our analysis , based on the cannonball model , shows strong evidence for the contribution of a supernova akin to sn1998bw , seen at the grb s redshift . the evidence is clearly there in all of the relevant observations",
