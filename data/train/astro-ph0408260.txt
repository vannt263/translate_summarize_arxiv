    "a complete census of rr  lyrae stars in a globular cluster is important , as it is the basis for determining the oosterhoff type of the cluster , which in turn is used to sort various cluster properties . @xcite",
    "first identified 10 variables in ngc  1851 , while @xcite classified and obtained periods for those objects , plus an additional four variables .",
    "eleven of the 14 variables were identified as rr  lyr types , and based on the mean period of the rr_ab _ ( @xmath1  days ) , @xcite classified the cluster as oosterhoff type  i. @xcite further refined the periods for the twelve previously known objects ( one of the variables for which @xcite failed to detect any variations is in fact an rr  lyr star ) , as well as determined the periods of an additional seven objects .",
    "those authors found the mean period of the rr_ab _ was 0.573  days , consistent with @xcite , and the ratio of rr_c_:rr_ab _  =  0.36 .",
    "thus , ngc  1851 was at the extreme end of the oosterhoff type  i clusters listed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered three more rr  lyr variables , raising the total to 22 objects , and found that the mean period of the rr_ab _ was now 0.572  days .",
    "however , the ratio of rr_c_:rr_ab _ jumped dramatically from 0.36 to 0.47 , again putting ngc  1851 at the extreme end of oosterhoff type  i clusters .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a thorough search of ngc  1851 for rr  lyr stars in the optical , and found seven more variables for a total of 29 .",
    "the mean period of the rr_ab _ increased slightly to 0.586  days , but the ratio of rr_c_:rr_ab _ was reduced back to 0.38 .",
    "@xcite list basic data on globular clusters with at least 10 rr_ab _ and 5 rr_c _ variables , and ngc  1851 has the most extreme mean period of the rr_ab _ , while the ratio rr_c_:rr_ab _ is high but not extreme .",
    "however , if the census of rr  lyr stars is incomplete , the true standing of the cluster with respect to other oosterhoff type  i clusters ( which may also be incomplete ) is uncertain .    as noted by @xcite , rr  lyr stars in the central region of the cluster , which is too crowded for ground - based observations to resolve ,",
    "are certainly expected .",
    "recently @xcite have reported 19 further variables in the cluster , some quite close to the core , using ground - based data , and they conclude that most are rr  lyr stars .",
    "also , @xcite used pre - costar _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ wf / pc data to identify 7 new rr  lyr candidates .",
    "it is clear that _ hst _ observations of the cluster ( particularly with instruments that correct for spherical abberation ) are capable of adding important new data on variables in the cluster center .",
    "we obtained far - ultraviolet imaging observations of ngc  1851 with the _ hst _   stis to search for variability of the x - ray burster located in the cluster core .",
    "while that candidate object @xcite was not found to be variable @xcite , several other objects are easily seen ( by visual inspection alone ) to be highly variable , with amplitudes of 2 - 4 magnitudes !",
    "we therefore measured the light curves of all objects in the cluster to identify all large - amplitude variables , and examination of these light curves reveal that the large - amplitude variables are very likely rr  lyr stars .",
    "thus , we may now have a near - complete census of the ngc  1851 rr  lyr population , which will allow us to determine if it is a typical or atypical oosterhoff type  i cluster .",
    "on 1999 march 24 , we obtained 4 orbits of _ hst _ stis fuv - mama imaging data with the long - pass quartz ( f25qtz ) filter .",
    "this filter has a central wavelength of 1595 , and a fwhm of 230 .",
    "the data were obtained in time - tag mode to support the temporal analysis desired for the main goal of the program - a study of the x - ray burster in the core of the cluster @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis of the data reveals 11 objects that were significantly variable , and basic information of these stars is given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows two of the stis images , with the variables identified . to better illustrate the dramatic nature of the variations , we show in figure  [ fig2 ] the full range for the four largest amplitude variables .",
    "on 1996 april 10 , we obtained _ hst _ wfpc2 images of ngc  1851 through the f439w and f336w filters ; these filters are very similar to the johnson b and u , respectively . to aid in identifying the objects for future studies , we include in figure  [ fig1 ] the f439w image .",
    "our prior photometric analysis @xcite determined the wfpc2 magnitudes for 7 of the variables , and these data are included in table  [ tbl-1 ] ; the four missing objects include one not on the pc image , and three that are in regions too crowded to obtain accurate measurements .",
    "prediscovery photometry of these variables from _ hst _ is also available in the f439w and f555w filters , approximating @xmath2 and @xmath3 , from the work of @xcite .",
    "we also include these colors in table  1 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that all of these stars lie in the region of the cluster color - magnitude diagram occupied by rr  lyr stars .",
    "although we have insufficient data to derive mean magnitudes , all of the candidate objects have 0 @xmath4 , in common with the well - studied rr  lyr s in ngc1851 discussed by @xcite .",
    "all of our candidates also lie within 0.8 mag of the mean @xmath3 of the cluster rr  lyr s observed by @xcite , suggesting that the luminosity of the hst variables is also consistent with this classification , although better observations are surely desirable .",
    "the light curves for the variables are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , which reveals that the objects are indeed most likely rr  lyr variables .",
    "even though we do not cover a full period for any of the objects , the distinctive shape of the light curves allows us to tentatively classify most of the objects .",
    "note that _ iue _ observations of the rrab stars rr  lyr and x  ari @xcite , and the rrc star dh  peg @xcite , show that the light curve shapes seen in the visible are reproduced in the ultraviolet , so fuv light curve shape can still be used to classify the stars .",
    "one exception may be rr08 , for which a period of @xmath5 minutes may be appropriate , thus ruling out an rr  lyr classification .",
    "it is interesting to note that of the @xmath5 objects detected in the stis far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) image , @xmath6 are rr  lyr stars . given this high fraction , and the extremely large amplitude , it appears that the fuv may be the best place to search for rr  lyr variables .",
    "we have unsuccessfully attempted to correlate the objects discussed by @xcite with the variables observed by _",
    "hst_. nine of their objects fall in the region covered by our data , but only six of these have plausible counterparts in wfpc2 data ( even allowing for reference frame offsets ) .",
    "further , of those six , three are far too faint to correspond to rr  lyr stars in the cluster , and none appear in our fuv data , quite contrary to our expectations .",
    "while the correct correlation of the @xcite objects with our _ hst _ objects may require further observations , it is clear from the excellent quality of the @xcite light curves that their objects are in fact genuine rr  lyrae stars .",
    "also note that none of the wf / pc candidates of @xcite fall in our stis field , and that sumeral object nv17 is coincident with saviane object 1 ( although the classifications differ ) .    a search of the _ hst _ archive reveals that there is only one other long duration , fuv imaging observation of a globular cluster that could be used to search for rr  lyr stars .",
    "analysis of this dataset on ngc  6752 ( obtained by m. shara on 2001 march 30 ) revealed no rr  lyr stars , despite the fact that the objects should be brighter than those in ngc  1851 , as the former cluster is @xmath7 mag closer .",
    "a search of the literature shows that no rr  lyr stars have been detected in the optical for this cluster @xcite , so it is perhaps not surprising that none were detected in the fuv .",
    "in the optical , rr  lyr stars have a typical amplitude of 0.5 - 1.0  mag , whereas our ultraviolet data shows a larger 2 - 4  mag variation .",
    "ultraviolet observations from the _ ans _ satellite of rr  lyr itself @xcite show that the amplitude of the pulsations steadily increases toward the far - ultraviolet , going from 0.8 mag at 3300  to 3.1 mag at @xmath8 . as a first approximation ,",
    "the amplitude of the pulsation should vary as ( db / dt)/b , where b is the planck function and t is the temperature .",
    "of course , this model is accurate only if the pulsation is non - radial , which is not the case for rr  lyr stars .",
    "however , if the radial variations are not a function of wavelength , then this simplified model will be a reasonable approximation for the wavelength dependence of the amplitude .",
    "for rr  lyr itself ( t @xmath9k ) , we find the ratio of the amplitudes at 1800  and 5500  to be 3.4 , so for a @xmath10  mag amplitude at 5500 , this simple model would predict an 1800  amplitude of 3.4  mag , very close to what is observed . for our more ultraviolet wavelength ( 1400 ) , we derive an amplitude of 4.6  mag .",
    "we show , in table  [ tbl-2 ] , the fuv amplitudes for several temperatures for two different v amplitudes .",
    "the ultraviolet amplitudes of the ngc  1851 rr  lyr stars fit nicely in these ranges .",
    "if we consider only the well - studied objects outside the cluster core , there were 29 previously known rr  lyr variables , so with the 11 new candidates presented here , the total count is now 40 variables . while we do not have periods for the new objects , we have determined their variability classes . as previously noted , @xcite found the ratio rr_c_:rr_ab _ to be 0.36 , @xcite increased the value to 0.47 , and @xcite reduced the value back to 0.38 . our updated value for the ratio is 0.54 , which is the second highest of all oosterhoff type  i clusters @xcite .",
    "if the @xcite candidates are included , the ratio drops back to 0.47 .",
    "we do not include the candidates of @xcite because of the concerns previously noted . when coupled with the fact that ngc  1851 has the most extreme mean period of the rr_ab _ , this cluster is truly an unusual oosterhoff type  i object .",
    "in addition to looking for variable objects in the data , we combined the stis and wfpc2 data to search for uv - bright objects .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the wfpc2 data revealed four uv - bright objects , two of which are also in the stis image ; both objects are marked in figure  [ fig1 ] on the stis images . a wfpc2 chart for the x - ray burster",
    "can be found in @xcite , while figure  [ fig4 ] shows a finding chart for the other uv - bright object .",
    "data for these objects  the x - ray burster ( xrb ) and the other uv - bright star ( uv )  are given in table  [ tbl-3 ] . neither object is variable , while the uv - bright star is significantly bluer in the far ultraviolet than the x - ray burster .",
    "reanalysis of the _ chandra _ hrc - s zeroth order image of ngc  1851 @xcite finds a possible faint x - ray source positionally coincident with the uv - bright object . at l@xmath11 ergs s@xmath12",
    ", this would suggest a quiescent low - mass x - ray binary ( qlmxb ) .",
    "however , its optical / uv brightness ( m@xmath13 ) implies a much lower l@xmath14/l@xmath15 ratio than the optically identified ( in quiescence ) qlmxb x5 in 47  tucanae ( l@xmath16 ergs s@xmath12 and m@xmath17=8.2 ; @xcite ) of course , since the _ chandra _ and _ hst _ observations were taken nine months apart , it is possible that the object was in an active state during the _ hst _ observations and a quiescent state during the _ chandra _ observations , which would skew the l@xmath14/l@xmath15 ratio .",
    "we have presented one of the few fuv observations of a globular cluster core , and find that rr  lyr stars are surprising numerous and prominent in ngc  1851 .",
    "fuv observations of cluster cores may prove an especially effective means of obtaining a near - complete census of rr  lyr stars , combining high angular resolution , suppression of luminous red stars , and data where the stellar pulsation amplitudes are greatly enhanced .",
    "we thank e. deutsch for providing wfpc2 photometry , and mike corwin for providing coordinate information necessary to correlate the @xcite data with the wfpc2 data .",
    "alister walker provided helpful comments on an early draft of this paper , and howard bond provided software to analyze the wavelength dependence of the pulsation amplitude .",
