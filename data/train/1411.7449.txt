    "the quantum steering ellipsoid of a two - qubit state is the whole set of bloch vectors that the qubit @xmath1 can be collapsed to by a positive - operator valued measurement ( povm ) on qubit @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "just as the bloch sphere provides a simple geometric presentation of a single qubit @xcite , the quantum steering ellipsoid gives a faithful and clear presentation for a two - qubit state .",
    "although the phenomenon of quantum steering was noticed at the early days of quantum theory @xcite , it is quite recently that the construction of qse for a given two qubit state was thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "the qse presentation makes the features of two - qubit states visualized @xcite , such as the nested tetrahedron condition for separable states , and the radial line segment condition for zero - discord states .",
    "the properties of qubit channels have been the research focus since the beginning of quantum information theory .",
    "a local quantum channel acting on one qubit of a two - qubit state can affect the state in various ways .",
    "generally , the local quantum operation decreases the correlation between the two qubits , causing effects such as entanglement sudden death @xcite .",
    "however , proper local channels can create and increase quantum correlations beyond entanglement , e. g. , quantum discord @xcite .",
    "the condition on local channels which can create and increase quantum discord has been well studied @xcite , yet the set of initial states whose quantum discord can be increased locally is still an open question .    in this paper , we make single - qubit channels visualized , by studying the evolution of the quantum steering ellipsoids of a two - qubit state under a local channel acting on qubit @xmath0 .",
    "for both the needle - shape qse states and the bell diagonal states with higher dimension qse , a local channel acting on @xmath0 shrinks the size of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this property can help to judge weather a two - qubit state can be obtained from another by local quantum channels .",
    "the qse @xmath4 of the output state @xmath5 is contained in the scope of @xmath2 , while qse of @xmath0 can be driven away from its original position , which may cause the increase of the @xmath0-side quantum discord .",
    "the connection is built between the the potential of a two - qubit state whose quantum discord can be increased locally and the shape of qses for the state .",
    "we strictly prove that a @xmath0-side discordant two - qubit state can be created from a classical state by a trace - preserving local channel if and only if it has needle - shape qses @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is not radial .",
    "generally , the quantum discord of a state with higher dimension qse can be increased by local quantum channels when the shape of qse is like a baguette , namely , one of the axes length is greatly larger than the two others .",
    "also , we find a class of entangled states whose quantum discord can be increased by local amplitude damping channel .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the pauli basis and @xmath7 be the single - qubit unitary operator .",
    "any single - qubit state @xmath8 can be written as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is called the bloch vector of the state @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , a two - qubit state @xmath12 can be expanded in the pauli basis as @xmath13 , where coefficient matrix @xmath14 can be written in the block form @xmath15 . here ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the bloch vectors of the reduced density matrices @xmath8 and @xmath18 respectively , and the @xmath19 matrix @xmath20 represents the correlations .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the qse @xmath2 of qubit @xmath1 can be constructed as follows .",
    "suppose the qubit @xmath0 is projected to a pure state @xmath21 , whose bloch vector is @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the state of @xmath1 is steered to @xmath24/\\mathrm{tr}[\\rho_{ab}(i\\otimes\\rho_{\\boldsymbol x})]$ ] , whose bloch vector is @xmath25 . for a state with @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the qse of qubit @xmath1 is simply the unit sphere of @xmath22 , shrunk and rotated by @xmath20 and translated by @xmath16 , which can be represented as @xmath28 for a state with @xmath29 , one can construct a stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) operator @xmath30 on qubit @xmath0 , which takes the two - qubit state to @xmath31 .",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath32 , and the qse @xmath33 of @xmath1 for state @xmath34 can be obtained following the above method .",
    "since the slocc on qubit @xmath0 does not affect the qse of qubit @xmath1 , we have @xmath35 .",
    "now we are left with the case @xmath36 , which means that @xmath18 is a pure state and @xmath12 must be a product state .",
    "therefore , the qse of @xmath1 is simply the single point @xmath16 . to obtain @xmath3 , one only need to make the substitution @xmath37 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the qse @xmath2 and @xmath3 of state @xmath12 have the same dimension , which equals to @xmath38 .",
    "an example for states with needle - shape qse is the so - called classical states , which has zero quantum discord . as proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , the state @xmath12 has zero quantum discord on @xmath0 if and only if @xmath3 is a radial line segment .",
    "the general form of a quantum - classical state with zero discord on @xmath0 is @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 are linearly independent density matrices of @xmath1 , @xmath41 are orthogonal pure states of @xmath0 , and @xmath42 .",
    "local channels on qubit @xmath0 can create @xmath0-side quantum discord from the above quantum - classical state . the output discordant state can be written as @xmath43 here @xmath44 @xmath45 do not commute with each other @xcite and thus are linearly independent .",
    "now we build the connection between locally created discordant states and the states with needle - shape qse by proving the following statement . _",
    "a @xmath0-side discordant two - qubit state can be created from a classical state by a trace - preserving local channel on @xmath0 if and only if its qse of qubit @xmath0 @xmath3 is a non - radial line segment . _    _ proof _ : we first prove the `` only if '' part , which means that any state @xmath46 in form of eq .",

    "next we prove that when a state has needle - shape qse , it can be created locally from a classical state .",
    "for a state with one - dimension qse , the corresponding @xmath59 matrix is rank 2 .",
    "then @xmath59 can be written as the sum of 2 rank-1 matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 , but not fewer .",
    "the rank-1 matrices @xmath62 and @xmath63 stand for product states , so all of the states with needle - shape qse can be written in the form of eq .",
