    "<S> we study the disordered heisenberg spin chain , which exhibits many body localization at strong disorder , in the weak to moderate disorder regime . a continued fraction calculation of dynamical correlations is devised , using a variational extrapolation of recurrents . </S>",
    "<S> good convergence for the infinite chain limit is shown . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the local spin correlations decay at long times as @xmath0 , while the conductivity exhibits a low frequency power law @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponents depict sub - diffusive behavior @xmath2 at _ all finite disorders _ , and convergence to the scaling result , @xmath3 , at large disorders . </S>"
