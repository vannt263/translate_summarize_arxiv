    "fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are responsible for momentum  @xcite and heat  @xcite exchanges .",
    "the pioneering works of casimir  @xcite and polder  @xcite were the first showing that such fluctuations are at the origin of an attractive force between two perfectly conducting infinite parallel planes as well as between an atom and a plate .",
    "this effect was theoretically predicted to exist even at thermal equilibrium , at zero temperature and in vacuum .",
    "a few years later , lifshitz  @xcite , dzyaloshinskii , and pitaevskii  @xcite developed a more general theory taking into account real material properties and thermal effects .",
    "much more recently , a series of papers  @xcite were focused on the effect of the absence of thermal equilibrium , showing that the presence of different temperatures in the system can not only qualitatively modify the behavior of the force ( e.g. changing its power - law dependence on the distance ) , but also induce a repulsive force , otherwise impossible for standard geometries such as two parallel slabs . starting from 1997 , several experiments have confirmed the theoretical predictions at thermal equilibrium , both for configurations involving macroscopic bodies ( mainly in the plane - plane and sphere - plane geometries )   @xcite and in the atom - plane configuration  @xcite .",
    "recently , the force between a bec and a plane has also been successfully measured out of thermal equilibrium  @xcite , confirming the theoretical predictions .",
    "another phenomenon emerging as a consequence of absence of thermal equilibrium is radiative heat transfer . using rytov s theory of fluctuational electrodynamics  @xcite , polder and",
    "van hove  @xcite showed that this energy - exchange mechanism , limited in the far field ( for distances much larger than the thermal wavelength @xmath1 , close to 8@xmath2 m at room temperature ) by the blackbody limit predicted by stefan - boltzmann s law , can overcome this value even by several orders of magnitude in the near - field regime .",
    "in particular , it was later shown that this amplification is particularly pronounced for materials supporting surface modes such as phonon - polaritons  @xcite .",
    "the radiative heat transfer has been experimentally investigated as well  @xcite , in a range of distances going from the nanometer region to several microns , confirming the behavior predicted theoretically .",
    "the recent theoretical history on both topics has seen the development of a series of general theories for casimir forces  @xcite , radiative heat transfer  @xcite or both in a unified approach  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical frameworks , based on a variety of approaches ( scattering matrices , green s functions , time - domain calculations , boundary - element method , fluctuating surface and volume currents ) , share the possibility of addressing bodies of arbitrary geometries and optical properties .",
    "even if some of them can tackle the general scenario of @xmath0 bodies , so far only a few applications involving more than two bodies have been considered .",
    "more specifically , the heat transfer has been analyzed between three nanospheres in the dipolar approximation  @xcite , between three parallel slabs  @xcite , as well as in a configuration involving one sphere between two slabs  @xcite .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the radiative heat transfer in networks of more than two particles has recently received a considerable attention , but only within the dipolar approximation  @xcite . concerning the casimir force ,",
    "it has been discussed in the case of an atom between two slabs  @xcite , three parallel slabs  @xcite , and very recently it has been considered the cases of two and three coupled cavities when the materials undergo a phase transition from the metallic to the superconducting phase  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on a system composed of @xmath0 planar parallel slabs made of arbitrary materials .",
    "the @xmath0 slabs , as well as the external environment in which they are immersed , have arbitrary temperatures . for this scenario ,",
    "we derive closed - form analytical expressions for the radiative heat transfer and the casimir force , both at and out of thermal equilibrium . to this aim ,",
    "we generalize the scattering - matrix approach previously introduced for two  @xcite and three  @xcite bodies .",
    "the analytical expressions we obtain clearly highlight the non - additive character of both momentum and energy exchange .",
    "we then consider two numerical applications , one for the casimir force and one for heat transfer , on a system made of four slabs .",
    "for the former , we show how the equilibrium position of the central slab in a system of three slabs is modified by the introduction and lateral shift of a fourth one . for the latter , by fixing some of the temperatures in the system , we discuss the distribution of the other temperatures at equilibrium as a function of the system parameters .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phys_syst ] , we present our physical system and introduce the main notation and definitions . then , in secs .  [ sec : energy_fluxes ] and [ sec : casimir ] , we formally derive the expressions of the poynting vector and the stress tensor , respectively .",
    "the coefficients needed to effectively compute both quantities are explicitly calculated in secs .",
    "[ sec : many_body_sc ] and [ sec : casimir_coefficients ] .",
    "then , we present in sec .  [",
    "sec : numerics ] our numerical applications to both casimir force and radiative heat transfer .",
    "we finally give some conclusive remarks .",
    "the system we address is composed of @xmath0 planar slabs orthogonal to the @xmath3 axis and assumed to be infinite in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "each slab is at equilibrium at temperature @xmath6 , thermalized by means of some external source , with @xmath7 .",
    "let the temperature of the left environment be @xmath8 and that of the right environment be @xmath9 , which can be seen as the equilibrium temperatures of two blackbodies at infinity to which we assign the labels @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "hereafter we refer this configuration as an @xmath0-body system .",
    "this distribution of bodies defines @xmath12 vacuum regions that we denote by @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath14 , the @xmath15-th slab has thickness @xmath16 and is centered at @xmath17 on the @xmath3 axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we want to compute energy and momentum fluxes across a surface within any of the vacuum regions of the system . the electric field at a point @xmath18 and time @xmath19 in region @xmath20 , which is created by the fluctuating currents inside the materials ,",
    "can be expressed as a fourier expansion given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the frequency .",
    "we require that @xmath23 in order for the field @xmath24 to be real , where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "in addition , the components @xmath25 can be decomposed using a plane - wave description  @xcite , in such a way that a single mode the field is specified by the frequency @xmath22 , the component @xmath26 of the wave vector on the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane , the two polarizations @xmath27 , and the direction of propagation along the @xmath3 axis which is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the latter can take two values : @xmath29 indicating propagation to the right and @xmath30 that indicates propagation to the left .",
    "the total wave vector reads @xmath31 , where the component @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 @xmath34 being the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "we note that when @xmath35 , the component @xmath32 is real and , therefore , the wave is propagative .",
    "when @xmath36 , @xmath32 is imaginary and the associated wave is evanescent .",
    "evanescent waves are nonpropagating modes of the field for which @xmath28 indicates the direction along with the amplitude of the wave decays .",
    "thus , taking this plane - wave decomposition into account , the single - frequency component of the electric field can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the components of the electric field in this decomposition and @xmath39 are the polarization vectors .",
    "besides , using the maxwell equation @xmath40 , the magnetic field @xmath41 can be obtained from the electric field and hence , the fourier components @xmath42 can be expanded in terms of the plane - wave components @xmath43 .",
    "each mode of the total field @xmath43 in any region @xmath20 depends on the fields generated by all the bodies as well as on the background fields present in the left and right environments .",
    "more specifically , the mode @xmath43 in region @xmath20 results from the source field modes that we denote ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) with @xmath44 , @xmath45 . at this stage",
    "we observe that the fact of considering only parallel planar slabs introduces a major simplification in the calculation . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the stationarity of the problem , as well as the translational invariance along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 axes safely allow us to state that the frequency @xmath22 , the wavevector @xmath46 and the polarization @xmath47 are conserved in any scattering process .",
    "moreover , thanks to the cylindrical symmetry with respect to the @xmath3 axis , any reflection and transmission coefficient will depend only on the modulus of the wavevector . as a result , the total field in each region can be written as a linear combination of the form @xmath48 in terms of the coefficients @xmath49 . hereafter ,",
    "if not otherwise explicitly stated , summations over indices labeling bodies run from @xmath50 to @xmath12 , including quantities associated with the environmental fields .",
    "equation will allow us in the following to relate the statistical properties of the total field in each region , needed to calculate both the casimir force and the heat transfer , to the statistical properties of the individual source fields , directly derived from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we can now move toward an explicit expression of the radiative heat transfer on each slab . to this aim",
    ", we should first observe that our assumption of infinite extension of all the slabs actually leads to a formally infinite flux .",
    "of course , the same issue applies to casimir force as well .",
    "nevertheless , the translational invariance allows us to think in terms of flux and force per unit surface . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    ", the transition from the calculation of the total flux ( or force ) to the one per unit surface basically simply consists in ignoring an infinite dirac delta @xmath51 and its coefficient @xmath52 in the final expressions .",
    "starting from the case of heat transfer , the energy flux per unit surface in region @xmath20 is given by the averaged @xmath3 component of the poynting vector @xmath53 , calculated in @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is located in zone @xmath20 .",
    "in cartesian components , we have @xmath56 where @xmath57 indicates symmetrized statistical average , @xmath58 are the levi - civita symbols with @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the vacuum permittivity . in order to compute this quantity",
    ", we introduce the correlation functions @xmath61 which are defined according to @xmath62 where the dagger denotes hermitian conjugate .",
    "thus , using eqs .   and , after manipulating the polarization vectors , the averaged @xmath3 component of the poynting vector takes the form  @xcite @xmath63c^{\\gamma\\phi\\phi ' } , \\end{split}\\label{energy_flux}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the projectors on the propagating and evanescent wave sectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively defined by @xmath66 @xmath67 being the heaviside step function .",
    "we observe that , as a consequence of eq .  , the energy flux @xmath68 is stationary and invariant under translations in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "notice that the dependence on @xmath3 in eq .",
    "is implicit through the correlation functions of the total field in a particular region @xmath20 of the system .",
    "we already have an expression [ eq .  ] connecting the total field in each region to the ones emitted by the bodies and the environments .",
    "we now perform the so - called local - thermal - equilibrium approximation , i.e. we assume that each body radiates as it would do at equilibrium at its own temperature , so that the modes of the source fields corresponding to different bodies are not correlated to each other . denoting by @xmath69 the correlation functions of the source fields associated to body @xmath15 , with @xmath70 , the assumption of local thermal equilibrium leads to  @xcite @xmath71 in addition , for convenience , we introduce the coefficients @xmath72 defined according to @xmath73\\mathcal{c}^ { j \\eta\\eta ' } \\equiv\\frac{\\hbar\\omega^2 \\mathcal{n } _ j } { 2\\varepsilon_0c^2k_z } \\mathcal{k}_{\\phi\\phi'}^ { j \\eta\\eta ' } , \\label{coefficients_k}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 @xmath75 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath76 the reduced planck constant . taking into account the previous definitions",

    "the above energy transmission coefficients will be computed in sec .",

    ", @xmath101 corresponds to the self - emission rate discussed in ref .  .",
    "we now focus on the casimir - lifshitz forces acting on the system .",
    "the formulation we introduce here is analogous to the previous one for heat transfer , but now momentum fluxes are the relevant quantities to be considered instead of energy fluxes . since energy and momentum fluxes are quantities with different physical nature , however , a priori one expects some differences to arise when comparing the two descriptions .",
    "for instance , the momentum transfer coefficients we introduce below are formally analogous to the energy transmission coefficients , but the former are represented by complex numbers while the latter are real . this fact is easy to understand if one bears in mind that the energy quanta @xmath102 are always real , whereas the momentum component @xmath103 becomes imaginary for photons characterizing evanescent fields .",
    "another important difference is that nonvanishing momentum fluxes occur even at thermal equilibrium and , as is well known , purely quantum fluctuations contribute to these fluxes as well . as a consequence ,",

    "<S> a general theory of photon - mediated energy and momentum transfer in @xmath0-body planar systems out of thermal equilibrium is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the combination of the scattering theory and the fluctuational - electrodynamics approach in many - body systems . by making a landauer - like formulation of the heat transfer problem , </S>",
    "<S> explicit formulas for the energy transmission coefficients between two distinct slabs as well as the self - coupling coefficients are derived and expressed in terms of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the single bodies . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how to calculate local equilibrium temperatures in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous formulation is introduced to quantify momentum transfer coefficients describing casimir - lifshitz forces out of thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> forces at thermal equilibrium are readily obtained as a particular case . as an illustration of this general theoretical framework </S>",
    "<S> , we show on three - body systems how the presence of a fourth slab can impact equilibrium temperatures in heat - transfer problems and equilibrium positions resulting from the forces acting on the system . </S>"
