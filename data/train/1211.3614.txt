    "let @xmath0 be a polyhedral domain , and consider the following elliptic equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a parameter that represents the ratio of the smallest and largest scales in the problem , and @xmath3 is a symmetric , positive definite , bounded tensor : @xmath4 for some positive constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "problems of the type ( [ eproblem ] ) are often used to describe the models arising from composite materials and flows in porous media , which contain many spatial scales . solving these problems",
    "numerically is difficult because of that resolving the smallest scale in problems usually requires very fine meshes and hence tremendous amount of computer memory and cpu time . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "many methods have been designed to solve the problem on meshes that are coarser than the scale of oscillations .",
    "one of the most popular methods is the multiscale finite element method ( msfem ) @xcite , which takes its origin from the work of babuka and osborn @xcite .",
    "two main ingredients of the msfem are the global formulation of the method such as various finite element methods and the construction of basis functions .",
    "the special basis functions which constructed from the local solutions of the elliptic operator contain the small scale information within each element . by solving the problem ( [ eproblem ] ) in the special basis function space",
    ", they get a good approximation of the full fine scale solution .",
    "we remark that there are many other methods proposed to solve this type of multiscale problems in the past several decades .",
    "see , for instance , wavelet homogenization techniques @xcite , multigrid numerical homogenization techniques @xcite , the subgrid upscaling method @xcite , the heterogeneous multiscale method @xcite , the residual - free bubble method ( or the variational multiscale method , discontinuous enrichment method ) @xcite , mortar multiscale methods @xcite , and upscaling or numerical homogenization method @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the book @xcite for an overview and more other references of multiscale numerical methods in the literature , especially a description of some intrinsic connections between most of these methods .    in this paper , we focus on the msfem .",
    "many developments and extensions of the msfem have been done in the past ten years .",
    "see for example , the mixed msfem @xcite , the msfems for nonlinear problems @xcite , the petro - galerkin msfem @xcite , the msfems using limited global information @xcite , and the multiscale finite volume method @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that there is a resonance error between the grid scale and the scales of the continuous problem .",
    "especially , for the two - scale problem , the resonance error manifests as a ratio between the wavelength of the small scale oscillation and the grid size ; the error becomes large when the two scales are close .",
    "the scale resonance is a fundamental difficulty caused by the mismatch between the local construction of the multiscale basis functions and the global nature of the elliptic problems .",
    "this mismatch between the local solution and the global solution produces a thin boundary layer in the first order corrector of the local solution . to overcome the difficulty due to the scale resonance , an oversampling technique was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is computing the local problem in the domain with size larger than the mesh size @xmath7 and use only the interior sampled information to construct the basis functions . by doing this ,",
    "the influence of the boundary layer in the larger domain on the basis functions is greatly reduced",
    ".    however , for the coarse - gird elements near the boundary , in order to construct the multiscale basis functions , the oversamping msfem needs to assume that there is enough information available outside of the research domain , which is not applicable in practice . to handle this problem ,",
    "the natural way is to use the standard multiscale basis functions instead of the oversampling multiscale basis functions in the coarse - grid elements adjacent to the boundary , hence in this area we do nt need to use the information outside the domain .",
    "we call this method as the mixed basis msfem .",
    "since in the elements near the boundary , we use the multiscale basis functions without oversampling technique , the scale resonance comes out again hence pollute the accuracy . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we introduce a new method in this paper which can improve the accuracy significantly .",
    "the proposed method separates the research area into two sub - domains such that one of them is contained inside the domain with a distance away from the boundary .",
    "then in the interior sub - domain the oversampling multiscale basis functions on a coarse mesh ( with mesh size @xmath7 ) are used . while , in the other sub - domain which adjacent to the boundary the traditional linear fem basis functions are used on a mesh ( with mesh size @xmath8 ) which is fine enough to resolving multiscale features . the difficulty to realize this idea is how to joint the two methods together without losing accuracies of both methods , i.e.",
    ", how to deal with the transmission condition on the interface between coarse and fine meshes efficiently .",
    "thanks to the penalty techniques used in the interior penalty discontinuous ( or continuous ) galerkin methods originated in 1970s @xcite , we may deal with the transmission condition on the interface by penalizing the jumps from the function values as well as the fluxes of the finite element solution on the fine mesh to those of the oversampling multiscale finite element solution on the coarse mesh .",
    "a rigorous and careful analysis is given for the elliptic equation with periodic diffusion coefficient to show that the @xmath9-error of our new method is just the sum of interpolation errors of both methods plus an error term of @xmath10 introduced by the penalty terms , where @xmath7 is the mesh size of the coarse mesh .",
    "we would like to remark that besides the applications of penalty technique to the interior penalty discontinuous ( or continuous ) galerkin methods , this technique is also applied to the helmholtz equation with high wave number to reduce the pollution error @xcite and applied to the interface problems to construct high order unfitted mesh methods@xcite .",
    "the other potential application of our proposed method is to solve the multiscale problems which may have some singularities .",
    "for example , the multiscale problem with dirac function singularities , which stems from the simulation of steady flow transport through highly heterogeneous porous media driven by extraction wells @xcite , or the multiscale problems with high - conductivity channels that connect the boundaries of coarse - grid blocks @xcite .",
    "our new fe - msfem may solve such problems by using the traditional fem on a fine mesh near the singularities ( and , of course , near the domain boundary ) and using the oversampling msfem in the other part of the domain . to demonstrate the performance of the fe - msfem",
    ", we try to simulate multiscale elliptic problems which have fine and long - ranged high - conductivity channels .",
    "we remark that this kind of high - conductivity features can not be localized within a coarse - grid block , hence it is difficult to be handled with standard or oversampling multiscale basis .",
    "the numerical results show that the introduced fe - msfem can solve the high contrast multiscale elliptic problems efficiently .",
    "the convergence analysis for multiscale problems with singularities and applications of the proposed fe - msfem to practical problems such as two - phase flows in porous media and other types of equations are currently under study .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec-2 ] ,",
    "we formulate the fe - msfem for the model problem . in section  [ sec-3 ] ,",
    "we review some classical homogenization results for the elliptic problems and give an interior @xmath11 norm error estimate between the multiscale solution and the homogenized solution with first order corrector . in section  [ sec-4 ]",
    ", we give some approximation properties for the oversampling msfe space and the linear fe space , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12 error estimate of the introduced fe - msfem is given in section  [ sec-5 ] . in section  [ sec-6 ]",
    "we first give some numerical examples for both periodic and randomly generated coefficients to demonstrate the accuracy the proposed method , and then apply our method to multiscale elliptic problems which have fine and long - ranged high - conductivity channels to demonstrate the efficiency of the method .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .    before leaving this section ,",
    "we fix some notations and conventions to be used in this paper . in the following ,",
    "the einstein summation convention is used : summation is taken over repeated indices .",

    "we use the @xmath13 based sobolev spaces @xmath15 equipped with norms and seminorms given by : @xmath16 @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the @xmath19 norm ( seminorm ) of @xmath20 in @xmath14 . throughout , @xmath21 denote generic constants , which are independent of @xmath22 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 unless otherwise stated .",
