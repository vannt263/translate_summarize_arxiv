    "the standard poisson - boltzmann equation ( pb ) is accurate for dilute aqueous solutions containing small monovalent ions .",
    "the first approximation of the pb theory is the mean - field account of the electrostatic interactions , where the discrete nature of ions is neglected and each ion interacts with the mean - potential generated by the local charge density distribution @xmath0 according to the coulomb law , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dielectric constant .",
    "this description clearly ignores ionic correlations .",
    "the other approximation within the pb theory is the lack of internal structure of each ion : an ion is a point in space characterized only by its charge . under this reduced description",
    "the ions f@xmath3 , cl@xmath3 , and no@xmath4 are indistinguishable , although their size  @xcite and polarizability  @xcite are obviously different .",
    "the pb description , therefore , breaks down when the above reductions can no longer be justified . in the present work we consider the weakly correlated limit so that the mean - field description of electrostatics holds , but we go beyond the standard pb equation by including the nonelectrostatic excluded volume effects  @xcite . in aqueous solutions",
    "the excluded volume interactions are further increased on account of hydration , the binding of water molecules to ions , so that the effective ionic radii are larger than the crystallographic ones  @xcite .",
    "another effect of hydration , related directly to electrostatics , is the dielectric decrement @xcite associated with the decrease of the medium dielectric constant on account of polarization saturation of a solvent constituting the hydration shell . in the present work we do not consider this effect and focus strictly on the non - electrostatic excluded volume effects .",
    "the excluded volume effects reorganize the double layer so that a density profile is no longer monotonically decreasing , but it acquires oscillatory structure reflecting molecular composition of an electrolyte @xcite . clearly , the modifications of the density profile lead to modified electrostatic properties . in the present study",
    "we take a close look into the excluded volume effects where ions are represented as hard spheres with the same diameter , the so - called , restricted primitive model . not only",
    "do we investigate how the ionic system responds to these effects under various conditions , but also how well various theories reproduce this behavior .",
