    "is the so - called critical field value ) .",
    "the influence of a strong external field on quantum processes is interesting because it catalyses the processes , it changes the kinematics and it induces new interactions .",
    "it is especially important to investigate the influence of external field on the loop quantum processes where only electrically neutral particles in the initial and the final states are presented , such as neutrinos , photons and hypotetical axions , familons and so on .",
    "the external field influence on these loop processes is provided by the sensitivity of the charged virtual fermion to the field and by the change of the photon dispersion properties and , therefore , the photon kinematics .",
    "the research of the loop processes of this type has a rather long history .",
    "the two - vertex loop processes ( the photon polarization operator in an external field , the decays @xmath12 , @xmath13 and so on ) were studed in the papers  @xcite .",
    "the general expression for the two - vertex loop amplitude @xmath14 in the homogeneous magnetic and in the crossed field was obtaned in the paper  @xcite , where all combinations of scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector interactions of the generalized currents @xmath15 with fermions were considered .    a loop process with three vertices is also intresting for theoreticians .",
    "for example , the photon splitting in a magnetic field @xmath16 is forbidden in vacuum .",
    "the review  @xcite and the recent papers  @xcite were devoted to this process .",
    "one more three - vertex loop process is the conversion of the photon pair into the neutrino pair , @xmath17 .",
    "this process is interesting as a possible channel of stellar cooling .",
    "a detailed list of references on this process can be found in our paper  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known ( the so - called gell - mann theorem  @xcite ) , that for massless neutrinos , for both photons on - shell and in the local limit of the standard - model weak interaction , the process @xmath17 is forbidden .",
    "because of this , the four - vertex loop process with an additional photon @xmath18 was considered by some authors . in spite of the extra factor @xmath19",
    ", this process has the probability larger than the two - photon process .",
    "the process @xmath18 was studied both in vacuum ( from the first paper  @xcite to the recent refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and under the stimulating influence of a strong magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "so , the calculation of the amplitude of the @xmath0-vertex loop quantum processes ( @xmath5 , @xmath20 , the axion and familon processes @xmath21 , @xmath22 and so on ) in a strong magnetic field is important , because these results can be useful for astrophysical applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a general analysis of the @xmath0-vertex one - loop process amplitude in a strong magnetic field is performed in section 2 .",
    "the amplitude , in which the one vertex is of a general type ( scalar @xmath23 , pseudoscalar @xmath24 , vector @xmath25 or axial - vector @xmath26 ) , and the other vertices are of the vector type ( contracted with photons ) , is calculated in section 3 .",
    "this amplitude is the main result of the paper .",
    "the analitical expressions for the amplitudes of the processes @xmath5 and @xmath7 are presented in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "we use the effective lagrangian for the interaction of the generalized currents @xmath27 with electrons in the form : @xmath28 j_i ,    \\label{eq : l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the generic index @xmath29 numbers the matrices @xmath30 , e.g. @xmath31 , @xmath27 is the corresponding quantum object ( the current or the photon polarisation vector ) , @xmath32 are the coupling constants . in particular , for the electron - photon interaction we have @xmath33 .",
    "a general amplitude of the process , corresponding to the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : l ] ) , is described by fig .",
    "[ fig : loop1 ] . in the strong field limit , after integration over the coordinates , the amplitude takes the form @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the asymptotic form of the electron propagator in the limit @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39,\\ ] ] @xmath40 @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the dimensionless field tensor , @xmath44 is the dual tensor , and the indices of the four - vectors and tensors standing inside the parentheses are contracted consecutively , e.g. @xmath45 .    as is seen from eq .",
