    "investigations into the behaviour of stars in globular clusters ( gcs ) have unearthed peculiarities that are not consistent with the expected behaviour of bound stars .",
    "these include extended structure surrounding clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) and unusual surface density profiles ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , individual stars with velocities near or above the escape velocity ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and a flattening of the velocity dispersion profile at large radii .    this flattening has been observed in an increasing number of clusters ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , although there are many cases where self - consistent models ( @xcite , @xcite ) have accurately fit the observed velocity dispersion profile of milky way and local group clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is not understood why some clusters show this feature and others do not , or how many clusters would be expected to display it .",
    "attempts to explain the flattening of the dispersion have ranged from the effects of extra - tidal stars to deviations from newtonian gravity @xcite . in modified newtonian dynamics ( mond , @xcite ) there is a transition into this regime from newtonian dynamics if both the acceleration of the gc around the galaxy and the internal acceleration of stars fall below a threshold acceleration , which can correspond to the radial position where the velocity dispersion profiles begin to flatten @xcite . alternatively",
    "the @xmath1 cold dark matter model , @xmath1cdm , and the hierarchical merger scenario for galaxy formation suggest that gcs formed in dark matter halos ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although internal effects expel dm from inside of clusters @xcite and tidal interactions would possibly strip the dm halo ( @xcite , @xcite ) , gcs on large galactocentric orbits could still contain this dm component , which would then interact gravitationally with stars in the cluster and increase their velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "however @xcite , hereafter k10 , showed that a flattening of the velocity dispersion profile occurs in simulations using purely newtonian dynamics .",
    "this is due to the effect of potential escapers ( pes ) , which are stars that orbit inside of gcs but with an energy above the critical energy required for escape ( , from now on fh00 ) .",
    "if in models of cluster evolution the tidal truncation is approximated as an energy truncation at the critical energy , then the lifetimes are proportional to the half - mass relaxation time @xmath2 , because stars gain energy on a relaxation time .",
    "fh00 noted that if a tidal field is included the lifetimes show a weaker dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "they found the cause to be a population of pes which increases the dissolution time , @xmath3 ; this effect is more important for simulations with a lower number of stars , @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite , hereafter b01 , showed with a model of the pes energy distribution that this delayed escape leads to a scaling of the lifetime of a cluster with @xmath4 .",
    "a constant fraction of stars are scattered above the critical energy each @xmath2 @xcite , but they do not escape instantaneously , and it is possible that some can be on stable orbits if the cluster is on a circular orbit @xcite .",
    "stars that gain a large energy kick from a single interaction can escape isotropically , however the majority of stars gain energy gradually via many encounters causing them to drift into the pe regime .",
    "these pes can then only escape via narrow apertures around the lagrangian points ( fh00 ) .",
    "for circular orbits , the lagrangian points l1 and l2 are along a line defined by connecting the centre of the cluster to that of the galaxy , where the radial derivative of the total potential ( the sum of the cluster potential , the tidal potential and centrifugal potential ) is zero .",
    "it is also the furthest distance from the cluster centre of the last closed equipotential surface , or jacobi surface ( see e.g. section 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "b01 found the scaling of the lifetimes with @xmath4 to be consistent with direct @xmath0-body models of star clusters orbiting in a point mass galactic potential .",
    "@xcite , hereafter tf10 , then studied the dynamical evolution of clusters in galaxies with different ( power - law ) density profiles with direct @xmath0-body simulations and confirmed the @xmath4 scaling of the lifetimes for clusters that are initially roche - filling .",
    "they also showed that for clusters with the same @xmath0 and tidal radius , orbiting in different galactic potentials , those with the highest angular frequency ( i.e. moving in flatter density profiles ) live longest . for clusters orbiting in flatter galactic density profiles ,",
    "the jacobi surface is compressed ( for the same jacobi radius , @xmath5 ) , resulting in smaller escape annuli and therefore a larger @xmath3 ( @xcite , hereafter r11 ) .",
    "this is contrary to what is found for clusters on different orbits in a given potential , because in that case @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angular velocity of the cluster orbit about the galaxy centre .",
    "measurements of the kinematics of stars within globular clusters are mostly based on line - of - sight velocities .",
    "however , to properly characterise the velocity dispersion anisotropy and rotation of these systems , proper motion data are required .",
    "various proper motion measurements have recently become available including observations using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the first data release ( dr1 ) of the esa gaia mission @xcite .",
    "dr1 provided proper motions of many field stars in the milky way and also included open cluster stars , and future releases will provide proper motions of stars in the outer regions of gcs . therefore , understanding the effects of pes on the kinematics is paramount to correctly interpreting the new data , as current models have been shown to still have large biases when comparing to projected data from simulations ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and will also help to develop a prescription for including their effects in a self - consistent model .",
    "the focus of this study is to use a series of simulations to investigate the properties of pes , including their spatial and energy distribution , their kinematics and their effect on the kinematics of the cluster as a whole .",
    "we do this to determine if there are any aspects of the pes which could be used to observationally constrain the external galactic potential , or if there are observable features of pes which can be used to discriminate between alternative predictions proposed by mond and dm theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe how the simulations were set up and what initial conditions were chosen .",
    "section 3 investigates the amount of pes that exist in the simulations , and their distribution and dynamics . in section 4",
    "we derive a prediction for the velocity dispersion at the jacobi surface and compare this to simulations and observational data",
    ". finally we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "all simulations were run using `` @xcite , a modified version of the direct @xmath0-body integrator `` @xcite optimised for use with gpus @xcite . ``",
    "( mode b ) allows any functional input for the galactic potential and avoids a linearised approximation of the tidal forces .",
    "we considered power - law mass profiles for our galactic potential , using the notation from @xcite and their equation a2 for the mass enclosed within a distance from the centre of the galaxy @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are scale factors . from this",
    "they obtain the potential in their equations a11 and a12 @xmath12 , & \\text{if $ \\lambda > 0 $ , $ \\lambda \\neq 1 $ } .\\\\",
    "\\displaystyle\\frac{gm_{\\rm{0}}}{r_{\\rm 0}}\\ln{\\frac{r_{\\rm{g}}}{r_{\\rm 0 } } } , & \\text{if $ \\lambda = 1$}.     \\label{eqn : phi }    \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    we consider 3 specific cases , using @xmath13 = 0 , 1 and 2 which correspond to a point mass , singular isothermal sphere , and a @xmath14 density profile ( i.e. the density profile within the scale radius of a navarro - frenk - white profile , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively . in each potential",
    "we simulate clusters with an initial number of stars @xmath15=16384 of the same mass , or with masses distributed according to the @xcite mass function between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we also vary the eccentricities of the orbit , using @xmath18= 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 and 0.75 .",
    "the equations of motion are solved in a non - rotating reference frame that orbits the galactic centre with the centre of mass of the cluster initially in the origin . for the analysis of the circular orbits we move the data to a corotating reference frame , where the @xmath19-axis joins the centre of the cluster and the galaxy , which is always located at @xmath20 , and the @xmath21-axis is positive in the direction of the tangential component of the orbital velocity ( fh00 ) .",
    "this is required as it is only possible to explicitly identify pes in the corotating frame using the jacobi energy of the stars ( see e.g. chapter 5 of @xcite ) . for the eccentric orbits",
    "this is not possible and we therefore carry out our analysis in the non - rotating frame . in this paper",
    "we use @xmath0-body units @xcite where @xmath22 , the initial total cluster mass @xmath23 and initial total energy @xmath24 .",
    "we set up the simulations such that the clusters on circular orbits in each potential have the same initial half - mass radius , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the initial conditions correspond to a king model with @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "however , as the king model describes spherical distribution of stars within the radius @xmath28 , using this in a tidal potential will introduce the presence of an initial population of pes outside the jacobi surface .",
    "this is because a jacobi surface with @xmath29 is triaxial and flatter in the @xmath21 and @xmath30 axes than in the @xmath19-axis .",
    "therefore we define our galactic potential such that @xmath5 = 1.5@xmath28 : in this way the king model will sit within the jacobi surface and have no initial pes - dependent population of pes due to the @xmath30-axis of the jacobi surface becoming increasingly flattened as @xmath13 increases . ] .",
    "the filling factor is then @xmath31 .",
    "the jacobi radius for circular orbits in a galaxy defined by equation  ( [ eq : gmass ] ) is @xmath32^{1/3 } \\label{eqn : tidalradius}\\ ] ] from @xcite , where @xmath7 , for our galactic potential , is defined as @xmath33    `` requires astrophysical units for the input values for the galactic potential and the orbit .",
    "we find values for @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in physical units that give us the desired @xmath5 .",
    "we keep @xmath36 the same for the circular orbits in the different potentials and calculate the required circular velocity of the cluster as @xmath37      to analyse the simulations in the corotating frame , the solid - body rotation of the cluster stars relative to the non - rotating frame needs to be removed . to find the velocity components in the corotating reference frame we use @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the velocity vectors in the corotating and nonrotating reference frames respectively , and",
    "@xmath41 is the solid body rotation due to the choice of the frame , which corresponds to @xmath42 in spherical coordinates , where @xmath43 indicates the angle from the positive @xmath19-axis in the direction of the positive @xmath21-axis .",
    "the positions in the corotating frame are then found by rotating the cartesian position vector in the nonrotating frame in the negative @xmath43 direction across the angular offset between the two frames .",
    ".input values for our series of simulations .",
    "columns from left to right are : name of the simulation , orbital eccentricity @xmath18 , apocentre radius @xmath44 , apocentre velocity @xmath45 ( both in @xmath0-body units ) , initial mass function imf and slope of the enclosed mass of the galaxy , @xmath13 .",
    "all simulations have @xmath46 particles . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     , as a function of the ratio of the position of the last bin to the calculated @xmath5 ( blue ) .",
    "the bins with the lowest values of velocity dispersion found in each of the profiles are also plotted in green . ]",
    "it is also possible to directly compare our prediction of @xmath47 to observational data .",
    "@xcite presented a compilation of line - of - sight velocities and proper motion data for stars in 50 milky way gcs from a wide range of data available from literature , which was used to create combined velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "we can consider the outermost bin of each of these velocity dispersion profiles and compare them to the value obtained from our prediction for each cluster . to calculate our estimate of @xmath47 we approximate the mass of the cluster using the absolute visual magnitude from the harris catalogue ( @xcite , 2010 edition ) and mass - to - light ratio from @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the angular velocity of the clusters using @xmath48 , by assuming @xmath49 km / s and by taking @xmath36 from the harris catalogue .",
    "table 2 includes the dispersion , @xmath50 , and radial position , @xmath51 , of the last data point , the ratio of the position of the last bin to the jacobi radius , @xmath52 , and ratio of the dispersion in the last bin to the prediction of the dispersion @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig : obsfract ] shows @xmath53 against @xmath54 .",
    "it is clear that the data does not extend to the approximate @xmath5 , which means that the observed dispersions are expected to be higher than the prediction for @xmath47 .",
    "most points follow an expected trend , with @xmath53 decreasing with increasing @xmath55 . the are some points that appear to not follow this trend .",
    "this is possibly due to internal properties of the cluster , which affect the radial distance from the centre of the cluster at which the effects of pes or of contamination from field or extra - tidal stars become significant .",
    "moreover , we recall that the calculations of @xmath47 and @xmath5 include some approximations that for some clusters could be less accurate than others .    fig .  [",
    "fig : rdep ] shows the velocity dispersion in the last bin of data against the galactocentric distance for each cluster in our sample , with the point size reflecting the mass of the cluster .",
    "we also show our prediction from equation  ( [ eq : prediction ] ) for the least massive cluster of the sample ( dashed line ) and for the most massive ( solid line ) .",
    "although most of the points lie above our prediction , there seems to be an increase in the dispersion with decreasing @xmath36 , suggesting there is more than just a mass dependence in the velocity dispersion at the jacobi surface .",
    "our prediction is a lower limit for the dispersion profiles , so it is expected that none of the data points should be lower than our prediction .",
    "this is because there are many reasons why the velocity dispersion of the outermost bins in the profile can be above our prediction , including projection effects and observational profiles not extending out to the jacobi surface .",
    "this means that it is likely difficult to discern between the effects that a dm halo may have on the outer regions of a velocity dispersion profile , from the effects of pes .",
    "the proper motion data provided by future releases of the gaia mission will allow for more rigorous selection criteria for cluster members , which can be followed up by further ground based observation of line - of - sight velocities , making it possible to probe closer to the jacobi surface of milky way star clusters .",
    "a combination of proper motions and radial velocity measurements for stars in the outer regions of gcs will also provide a way of inspecting the rotation and anisotropy of the dispersion , which may be required to discriminate between these scenarios as the retrograde bias in the orbits of the pes may not be present when there is the additional effect of a dark matter halo .",
    "by running simulations of star clusters and varying the orbital eccentricities , initial mass function , and galactic ( power - law ) mass profiles , we have explored the distribution and behaviour of a population of energetically unbound stars within the jacobi radius of a cluster , and found three properties of the pes to vary with the slope of the enclosed galactic mass : 1 ) the fraction of pes inside the jacobi radius , 2 ) the velocity dispersion at the jacobi surface , 3 ) the velocity anisotropy .    for an equal - mass system in a point",
    "mass galactic potential we found the fraction of pes inside the jacobi radius to be consistent with the value found by b01 .",
    "however , a mass spectrum and shallower galactic density profiles both cause an increase in the number of pes , up to 40% in a @xmath14 density profile galaxy with a globular cluster type imf between 0.1 and 1@xmath56 . at",
    "@xmath57 there are equal number of pes and bound stars , and beyond this radius the pes dominate .",
    "this suggests that pes should have a large influence on cluster kinematics , especially in the outer parts . by inspecting the fraction of total mass in pes and the evolution of the distribution of masses for the pes",
    ", we found that a large fraction of pes will be low mass for most of the lifetime of the cluster , meaning that the majority of these stars could not be observed currently , but can contribute significantly to the total mass .",
    "the energy distribution of pes becomes wider as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "this width is also larger for larger @xmath13 , and we introduce a @xmath13 dependence to the model established in b01 .",
    "we then investigated the effect of the pes on the kinematics .",
    "the radial profiles of the anisotropy of the dispersion early in the simulations for the circular orbits are consistent with zero ( i.e. isotropy ) .",
    "however , the simulations in the @xmath13=0 and @xmath13=1 potentials develop tangential anisotropy in time whereas the @xmath13=2 simulation shows radial anisotropy .",
    "this is possibly due to two - body interactions scattering stars outwards on radial orbits , as these orbits also preferentially escape from the cluster . therefore the clusters with the larger escape time in the shallowest galactic density profiles create radial orbits faster than the stars can escape . throughout the entire lifetime the clusters in the @xmath13=1 and @xmath13=2 simulations also have some radial anisotropy before @xmath58 decreases towards the tangential anisotropy .",
    "this decrease in @xmath58 occurs faster in the @xmath13=0 simulation .",
    "the rotation profiles show a clear negative value for the mean of the @xmath43 component of the velocity in the corotating reference frame which is also seen in a negative bias of the @xmath59 distribution .",
    "this retrograde motion is expected as prograde orbits are less stable and preferentially lost from the cluster .",
    "the pes cause the @xmath60 profile to become increasingly negative with radius , as pes dominate further from the centre of the cluster , and at the jacobi radius they have around half of the circular velocity at @xmath5 .",
    "there is also a difference in the @xmath13=2 simulation , which seems to develop more negative @xmath60 over the lifetime , whereas the @xmath13=0 and @xmath13=1 stay roughly constant .",
    "for the simulations of clusters with a mass spectrum there seems to be no substantial variation in the dynamics when comparing to the equal - mass simulations .",
    "similarly when using higher values of orbital eccentricity , there seems to be only minimal variation of the dynamics , but there is a suggestion of less tangential anisotropy and less retrograde rotation when increasing eccentricity .",
    "we then formulated a relation for the velocity dispersion at @xmath5 due to the effect of pes . from the model of the distribution of @xmath61 of pes developed in b01 , we can approximate the velocity dispersion at the jacobi surface @xmath47 as a function depending on @xmath62 .",
    "we compared our prediction to simulations and observational data . by scaling the constant of proportionality of the prediction to match the velocity dispersion between 0.9@xmath5 and @xmath5 over time in the @xmath130@xmath180 simulation ,",
    "the profile is well matched by the mass dependence of our prediction and the @xmath13 dependence reproduces the variation across the different potentials .",
    "we also found our prediction to be close to the values of the velocity dispersion near the jacobi radius in simulations with a much larger number of particles .",
    "this prediction is useful for testing the different theories that attempt to explain the flattening of the velocity dispersion .",
    "for example , some predictions using mond find the flattened value of the velocity dispersion @xmath63 , whereas our prediction contains an additional dependence on the orbit , suggesting a way to discriminate between the two scenarios .",
    "we show that there is a dependence of the velocity dispersion , anisotropy and rotation properties of pes on the galactic mass profile ( i.e. @xmath13 ) .",
    "this suggests that the pes can be used as an independent method to determine properties of the underlying dark matter profile , which could be especially important in the core v cusp debate in dwarf galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . for example , the increasing abundance of pes with increasing @xmath13 could lead to a higher mass - to - light ratio .",
    "such a @xmath13 dependent mass - to - light ratio could help explain why the metal - poor clusters fornax 3 and fornax 5 have an observed mass - to - light ratio higher than synthetic stellar population models ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this velocity dispersion prediction is also useful for generative models of tidal streams , which require releasing particles from a cluster with a chosen velocity dispersion ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this dispersion affects the width of the stream and therefore using the correct value is important to be able to accurately use the streams to infer galactic properties .",
    "we compared our results to available observational data .",
    "we used recently compiled velocity dispersion profiles from @xcite , which contain a wide range of radial velocity and proper motion measurements from literature , and showed that most of the observed values of the velocity dispersion in the outermost bins of data lie above our prediction .",
    "there are many reasons why the observational data would increase above our prediction , including the fact that the data do not extend close enough to @xmath5 , projection effects , and that a large fraction of clusters are still under - filling their roche volumes . despite this",
    ", we found some clusters to be close to our prediction and not to be consistent with a prediction that would only depend on the mass of the cluster , suggesting that there is a dependence on the galactocentric distance consistent with our @xmath64 dependence . with the upcoming gaia data it will be possible to detect stars further from the centre of globular clusters than it is currently possible . accurately understanding the behaviour of pes provides an independent way of inferring galactic properties and avoids the misidentification of other effects , such as the effects of a dark matter halo",
