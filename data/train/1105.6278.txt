    "spin - orbit interactions in semiconductor materials offer interesting possibilities of spin control in nanostructures.@xcite among them , the rashba interaction that originates in externally applied electric fields is most promising due to its tunability . in this work",
    "we prove that the rashba interaction is an important source of spin anisotropy in hole quantum wires .",
    "this anisotropy manifests in large differences between the energy splittings for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the wire.@xcite our calculations show that in the presence of rashba interaction the perpendicular field becomes much less effective in generating spin splittings than the parallel one .",
    "this effect is favored by the deformation of the quantum wire , i.e. , anisotropy increases when the wire evolves from 3d towards a more flat quasi 2d geometry .    in semiconductor hole systems like p - type gaas nanostructures transport",
    "is mediated by holes in the valence bands . as compared to electrons ,",
    "holes are characterized by a spin 3/2 , besides a sign difference in charge .",
    "the corresponding fourfold discrete space is a source of qualitative differences with respect to the more usual twofold spin of electrons . in 2d hole gases",
    "different splittings for normal and in - plane fields have been observed , as well as for different in - plane orientations.@xcite by further confining the hole gas it is possible to generate nanostructures with the shape of quantum wires . in this case , the splitting varies , in principle , with both wire and magnetic field orientations.@xcite    there are few theoretical analysis of the spin splittings in hole quantum wires.@xcite although the rashba interaction was usually not taken into account , this situation changed in some recent works.@xcite indeed , quay _",
    "et al._@xcite have observed the formation of a spin - orbit gap induced by the combined action of magnetic field and rashba coupling in a hole quantum wire , while chesi et _",
    "al._@xcite have studied , both experimentally and theoretically , the spin resolved transmission of a quantum point contact fabricated in a 2d hole gas . in the latter ,",
    "the rashba interaction is shown to favor a band crossing at finite wavenumber that can be manipulated with an external magnetic field . in agreement with our results , this",
    "crossing is obtained in a multiband description of the hole states .",
    "it can also be explained within a restricted single band description adding a cubic rashba term .    in this work",
    "we have focussed our attention on the structure - inversion - asymmetry ( rashba ) splitting since this is known to be the dominant source of spin - orbit coupling in gaas .",
    "the bulk - inversion - asymmetry ( dresselhaus ) is much smaller and has a minimal effect on the energy bands.@xcite we will show that in a hole quantum wire oriented along @xmath0 the rashba interaction due to asymmetry in the growth direction ( @xmath1 ) causes a large difference between parallel ( @xmath0 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath2 ) g factors of the wire , as deduced from the @xmath3-induced splittings of the conductance steps .",
    "this anisotropy is due to the quenching of the splitting when @xmath3 is along @xmath2 and the wire flatness is large . for smaller deformations",
    "the situation is less clear due to a non monotonous evolution of the splittings that may result in a sample - dependent scenario .",
    "we describe the anisotropic kinetic energies @xmath4 of the holes in a 4-band kp model . introducing a spin discrete index @xmath5 and following the notation of ref .",

    "we only refer to contributions in the upper triangle of matrix @xmath16 since the remaining ones can be inferred from the hermitian character of the matrix . in all calculations discussed below",
    "we have used numerical values for the kp parameters @xmath17 s corresponding to gaas.@xcite    the wire confinement is represented by a deformed 2d harmonic oscillator . assuming the wire is oriented along @xmath0 while transverse and growth directions are given by @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively , it is @xmath18 the adimensional parameter @xmath19 of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , corresponding to the ratio of confinement strengths in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , controls the flatness or 2d character of the wire . the direct coupling with the magnetic field @xmath20 is given by the zeeman term @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a kp parameter",
    ", @xmath23 represents the bohr magneton and @xmath24 is the angular momentum operator for a spin 3/2 .",
    "finally , the rashba interaction is described by @xmath25 where we defined a vector constant @xmath26 , related to the effective electric field @xmath27 and kp parameter @xmath28.@xcite we shall treat @xmath29 as a two - parameter vector with dominant component along the growth direction , i.e. , @xmath30 with @xmath31 .    in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the orbital effects of the field are taken into account by means of the substitution @xmath32 with the vector potential @xmath33 . in this process",
    ", hermiticity is enforced in the cross terms by using the symmetrized forms , such as @xmath34 . summarizing all contributions the total",

    "the eigenvalues are ordered as @xmath40 since the spectrum is not bounded from below due to the negative kinetic terms .",
    "we have obtained the solutions of the eigenvalue problem given by eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) by discretizing in harmonic oscillator states for the two transverse oscillators along @xmath2 and @xmath1 , @xmath41 represent the number of quanta in each oscillator , respectively .",
    "the resulting matrix eigenvalue problem reads @xmath42    in practice the number of oscillator states in expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) can be truncated once convergence of the results is ensured .",
    "the results shown below are well converged and they have been obtained including the lower 20 oscillator states in each direction . in appendix",
    "[ appb ] a precise discussion on the relevance of the basis truncation is given .",
    "as illustrative examples , fig .  [ fig1 ] displays the energy bands of selected cases . as is well known , the rashba interaction causes a characteristic band structure easily recognizable by the pairs of subbands crossing at @xmath43 and with maxima at opposite @xmath36 values ( left panel ) .",
    "these maxima correspond to band energy minima for the case of electrons . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "when this points along the wire ( @xmath0 , central panel ) , an anticrossing of the bands appears at @xmath43 .",
    "this anticrossing may lead to anomalous conductance steps , similar to those recently measured in ref .  .",
    "[ fig1 ] this behavior can be seen for @xmath44 . for @xmath3 in the transverse direction ( @xmath2 , right panel )",
    "the band crossings persist , but the two central maxima for each pair of bands are shifted differently in energy , the band structure becoming asymmetric with respect to @xmath36 inversion .",
    "the @xmath3-induced modifications of the band structure , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , cause a change in the conductance of the wire .",
    "this modification of the conductance , in the limit of weak magnetic field , is conveniently summarized by a number called the g factor of each conductance split level . at @xmath45 ,",
    "time reversal invariance of the system causes the conductance @xmath46 to increase in steps of @xmath47 as the fermi energy of the leads is reduced , where @xmath48 is the conductance quantum .",
    "the evolution of the wire conductance with energy can be understood if we imagine a horizontal line , indicating the position of the fermi energy , in the left panel of fig .  1 ; as this line is moved to lower energies it sweeps the band maxima always in pairs , each maxima corresponding to an increase of @xmath49 in the conductance for hole transport .",
    "the result is the typical staircase conductance , with step heights of @xmath47 . a similar procedure for the central and right panels of fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "convince ourselves that intermediate half steps in conductance are caused by the magnetic field .",
    "they are smaller than the full steps and proportional to the intensity of the magnetic field .",
    "the scenario we have just sketched is explicitly shown in fig",
    ".  [ condfig ] , highlighting the conductance half steps at odd multiples of @xmath49 .",
    "notice that the energy span varies for each specific conductance half step . in the limit of weak magnetic fields we can conveniently summarize the @xmath3-induced @xmath50th half step in the conductance , appearing between steps at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , in terms of a single number called the g factor . as this number depends on the conductance step and the magnetic field orientation , we use the notation @xmath53 and @xmath54 to indicate the g factor of the @xmath50th step , for @xmath3 along @xmath0 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "of course , other orientations are in principle possible , but we will restrict first to these two as they are the relevant ones in the measurements of spin hole anisotropy . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we will briefly mention the behavior for @xmath1-oriented field .",
    "our precise definition of the parallel - field g - factor is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the energy range for the @xmath50th half step in a magnetic field @xmath3 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , the factor 3 in the denominator is introduced by convention.@xcite the definition of @xmath54 , for magnetic field along @xmath2 , is obtained simply replacing @xmath56 by @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] displays the perpendicular ( lower row ) and parallel ( upper row ) g factors for the lower conductance steps , as a function of the wire deformation @xmath19 and for different values of the rashba coupling @xmath58 .",
    "these are the main results of our work .",
    "they were obtained for a specific wire orientation and direction of crystallographic growth ( @xmath1 ) taken from the experimental works of danneau _",
    "et al._@xcite and koduvayur _",
    "et al_.@xcite we have checked , however , that a qualitatively similar influence of the rashba intensity and confinement deformation are obtained assuming other arbitrary orientations .",
    "the g factors show a general tendency to decrease as @xmath19 increases , except for smaller deformations ( @xmath59 ) for which @xmath60 may increase or even show irregular behavior in some cases .",
    "focussing first on @xmath61 , we notice that this component does not change significantly when the rashba intensity increases , specially at large @xmath19 s , for which the results are almost overlapping in the upper panels of fig .",
    "very remarkably , however , for magnetic field in the perpendicular direction small variations in @xmath58 are enough to strongly modify the values of @xmath62 .",
    "this is more clearly seen in figure [ fig3 ] , which displays the dependence with rashba coupling intensity of the g factors .",
    "there is a general rashba - induced quenching of @xmath63 in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , quite conspicuous for @xmath64 and 5 .",
    "this effect is so strong that it can reverse the relative importance of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; from @xmath65 when @xmath66 to @xmath67 for increasing @xmath58 ( @xmath68 , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . with the chosen values of @xmath58",
    "we even find a range of @xmath19 s for which @xmath69 essentially vanishes .",
    "it is interesting to point out that a similar quenching of conductance plateaus in transverse field was discussed in ref .   for parabolic wires with electron conduction , as opposed to the present hole conduction . in both cases",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling is the underlying mechanism .    turning to the comparison with experiments",
    ", this is somewhat complicate due to the sample dependence .",
    "in general , however , a large g - factor anisotropy between parallel and perpendicular orientations has indeed been observed in refs .  .",
    "this was generally attributed to a preferential orientation of the spins along the wire for strong confinements .",
    "our results prove with detailed calculations that the rashba interaction for holes is the specific mechanism allowing the appearance of this anisotropy .",
    "as this interaction is sample dependent and may vary with external field , our results also predict that the hole g factors may be tunable to a certain degree , what may be relevant for spintronic applications .",
    "the experimental values of wire deformation @xmath19 are somewhat uncertain in general , which is an additional source of difficulty for comparison .",
    "in general , however , experimental wire deformations are @xmath59 , which in our calculations corresponds to a regime with rather large fluctuations ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . only for larger @xmath19 s",
    "the value of @xmath63 is consistently below @xmath70 at high enough @xmath58 .",
    "we believe that detailed comparison in this regime is quite involved due to the fluctuations . on the other hand , these sharp variations of @xmath61 in the small-@xmath19 regime and of @xmath62 at all @xmath19 s can be seen as a manifestation of magnetoconductance tunability via the rashba coupling .",
    "a more transparent physical interpretation , complementing the above numerical results , can be obtained in a simplified model based on only two bands .",
    "focussing on the @xmath71-th intermediate half step having conductance @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , we select the two states @xmath71 and @xmath74 at a given @xmath36 , @xmath75 , where the zero subscript is indicating absence of a magnetic field .",
    "these two states are the basis in which the effect of the magnetic field in different orientations will be described .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath3-field hamiltonian may be split as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the zeeman energy defined above in eq .",
    "( [ eqz ] ) and @xmath78 is the zero field hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hfull ] ) .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ h2b ] ) neglects orbital field effects , a simplifying assumption motivated by the qualitative nature of the present two - band model .",
    "the zero - field energy bands , given by @xmath79 are assumed known ; such as those displayed in the left panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] for a specific confinement and rashba intensity . in presence of a magnetic field",
    "the modified energy bands are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath80 where @xmath81      in a parallel field @xmath82 and , for this case , we have found that the @xmath83 vanish .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behavior of conduction electron wires , where the spin textures also show a vanishing integrated spin along the wire.@xcite in parallel orientation the band extrema are at @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , middle panel ) for which @xmath84 due to kramers degeneracy . under these conditions we find from the two eigenvalues of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ m2b ] ) that @xmath85 that is , the parallel g - factor is determined by the transition matrix elements of the parallel spin component between the kramers degenerate states at @xmath43 .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows this transition matrix element for @xmath86 .",
    "notice that for @xmath87 the transition matrix element is not depending on the rashba intensity , thus explaining why the parallel g - factor is not strongly affected by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "for @xmath88 the band maxima are shifted in opposite directions for positive and negative @xmath36 s ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] right panel ) .",
    "this implies that the energy difference determining the g factor corresponds now to states with opposite wavenumbers , say @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for nonzero @xmath89 the two states @xmath91 and @xmath92 are nondegenerate and , for a sufficiently small field",
    ", we should have @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ m2b ] ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", we find that @xmath94 actually vanishes for the perpendicular field .",
    "this is the regime of non - degenerate first - order perturbation theory with modified energies @xmath95 and @xmath96 . with the explicit definition of the @xmath17 s and noting that @xmath97 and @xmath98 for any @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) the perpendicular g factor reads @xmath99    it seems natural that in @xmath2 orientation the g factor is simply proportional to the expectation value of @xmath100 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the variation of this expectation value with the wavenumber and the rashba intensity .",
    "notice that typically @xmath101 , i.e. , the maxima are located in the central part of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] lower panel .",
    "when the rashba intensity @xmath58 increases there is a severe reduction of @xmath102 in absolute value for this central region .",
    "this is the mechanism by which the rashba interaction quenches the transverse g factor ; namely , by means of a strong reduction of the transverse @xmath2 spin component .    for strong spin - orbit coupling",
    "the expectation values of all three components of the spin vector at zero magnetic field , @xmath103 , vanish ; a manifestation of the spin randomization induced by the rashba field @xmath29 . in @xmath2 orientation",
    "this induces a quenching of the g factor through eq .",
    "( [ gp2b ] ) but , quite remarkably , kramers degeneracy at zero wavenumber keeps the parallel g factor almost unaffected by virtue of the transition matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ gpa2b ] ) .",
    "the g factors obtained from eqs .  ( [ gpa2b ] ) and ( [ gp2b ] )",
    "nicely agree with the results from the full diagonalization when orbital effects of the magnetic field are also neglected in the latter .",
    "the comparison with the complete model , results of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , is less good ; the trends are qualitatively reproduced but differences may be as large as a factor two .",
    "orbital effects of the field are thus quite important for a precise analysis .",
    "we have attributed the anisotropy of magnetotransport g factors in hole quantum wires to the rashba interaction . when the wire deformation and rashba interaction are both large enough ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) @xmath63 is greatly quenched by the rashba interaction and @xmath70 is almost unaffected . for lower wire deformations ( @xmath59 )",
    "we find a fluctuating , sample dependent behavior of the g factors .",
    "this work was supported by grant no .",
    "fis2008 - 00781 from micinn .",
    "experimental g factors are usually obtained for magnetic fields in the @xmath106 plane , either in parallel ( @xmath0 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath2 ) direction with respect to the wire . for completeness , in this appendix we discuss in a qualitative way the effects of the magnetic field when this points along the growth direction @xmath1 .",
    "the energy bands are similar to those of the @xmath0 orientation ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : they are symmetric respect to @xmath36-inversion , with anticrossing points at @xmath43 , although the @xmath3-induced splitting is much stronger",
    ". this enhancement agrees with experiments@xcite and is surely due to the important orbital motions induced by the field in this geometry .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath61 denote the g factors for @xmath1 and @xmath0 fields , respectively .",
    "looking at the rashba - field dependence , @xmath108 behaves similarly to @xmath109 ( along @xmath2 ) : it decreases with increasing @xmath110 but does not vanish for the maximum value we have taken ( @xmath111 ) . for strong wire deformation",
    "the saturation value corresponds to @xmath112 , while for in - plane magnetic field it corresponds to @xmath113 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for small values of @xmath19",
    "the behavior of @xmath108 is less regular , as for the other orientations , but it tends to increase with @xmath19 . within the two - band model of sec .",
    "iv we expect @xmath114 which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ gpa2b ] ) , replacing @xmath115 , and is now depending on the value of the rashba intensity .",
    "this appendix discusses the relevance of the truncation of the number of oscillator states for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 oscillators .",
    "it is usually assumed that the confinement allows the truncation to the lowest , or few lowest , states .",
    "here we explicitly check this quantitatively for selected values of @xmath19 , the ratio of the two confinement strengths .",
    "we restrict , for simplicity , to the @xmath45 case with strong rashba coupling in the growth direction .",
    "figure [ figpband ] displays the evolution of the band structure when a ) increasing @xmath116 and @xmath117 sequentially from left to right panels ; and b ) increasing the deformation degree @xmath19 from top to bottom panels .",
    "the right column shows results that are very close to physical convergence .",
    "looking at the successive band crossings at @xmath43 , we notice that the truncation to @xmath118 grossly overestimates the energy separation between pairs of bands in all cases .",
    "it is remarkable that for increasing flatness degree the @xmath119 truncation deviates more and more from the right column .",
    "this is a consequence of the intersubband couplings induced by the kp and rashba hamiltonians : at least a few bands in the shallow oscillator ( @xmath2 ) are essential even for large @xmath19 s .",
    "more reasonable results are found for @xmath120 , although the differences with the @xmath121 basis are still large quantitatively . in this case , however , increasing @xmath19 improves the quality of the description since intersubband coupling is allowed at least in @xmath2 direction . finally , the @xmath122 results are close to the converged ones and only the insets reveal that sizeable differences are present at intermediate or low values of @xmath19 .",
    "these differences are small in the behavior of the upper bands and become more and more important as the energy is reduced . from this analysis we conclude that for our present purpose , namely the description of magneto - g - factors of several successive conductance steps , it is essential to include enough oscillator bands in both @xmath2 and @xmath1 oscillators .",
