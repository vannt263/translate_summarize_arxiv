    "a quantitative study of @xmath114 requires a more accurate model for the coexisting sc and dw states , which includes the influence of sc on the dw state .",
    "the critical fluctuations near the dw - metal phase transition also strongly influence the sc state via the renormalization of the e - e interaction.@xcite however , the proposed rough model gives a reasonable quantitative agreement with experiment on the slope of @xmath115 at @xmath116 .",
    "one more unusual feature observed in these compounds is the hysteresis in the pressure dependence of the sc transition temperature @xmath117 . in the soliton scenario",
    "this hysteresis may come from the motion of soliton walls in order to achieve the optimal soliton - wall concentration @xmath118 as pressure @xmath59 changes .",
    "the hysteresis in @xmath119 can also be explained in the open - pocket scenario if the dw wave vector shifts at @xmath36 with change in pressure to find the optimal dw wave vector at imperfect nesting . since the dw wave vector is pinned by crystal imperfections ,",
    "this shift of the dw wave vector is hysteretic , which leads to the hysteresis in @xmath120 and in the sc transition temperature @xmath121 .    an accurate description of the sc properties in both scenarios must go beyond the weak - coupling theory , because the new fermi energy ( i.e. , @xmath120 in the new fs pockets or the bandwidth @xmath49 in the soliton phase ) is comparable to the sc energy gap as @xmath17 and is much smaller than the debye energy .",
    "this fact , for example , may be responsible for the upward curvature of @xmath110 in the scenario of open pockets , where @xmath122 when @xmath123 , the small value of @xmath120 is smeared out by high temperature .",
