    "the significant amount of research effort devoted to the discovery and understanding of new aspects of geometrically frustrated magnetic systems in recent decades has been almost exclusively focused on the study of bulk properties.@xcite among such systems , a large number of materials have been identified which are realizations of the prototype frustrated triangular antiferromagnet ( af ) .",
    "in addition to the af near - neighbor in - plane coupling , the vast majority of these systems are also characterized by af coupling between stacked triangular layers , such as in most of the abx@xmath0 compounds.@xcite theoretical and experimental studies of magnetic excitations in these model materials have revealed important information on the nature of the fundamental interactions and exposed new types of spin - wave modes in the bulk systems.@xcite interest in surface effects on frustrated magnetic systems has been enhanced recently with the fabrication of new materials classes .",
    "studies of hexagonal magnetoelectric and multiferroic rare - earth magnetites ( e.g. , rmno@xmath0 ) thin films are being fueled by potential technological applications in the field of spintronics.@xcite ultrathin films of mn on fcc ( 111 ) fe - ni substrates also offer the possibility to study af triangular layers.@xcite the understanding of thin - film , surface and interface spin dynamics of such systems is of interest for the engineering of high data transfer rate devices.@xcite    in the present work , results are shown of solving the operator equation of motion to examine surface spin excitations in a model of af coupled frustrated triangular layers which have either easy - plane or easy - axis anisotropy .",

    "depending on the specific system of interest ( e.g. , semi - infinite and thin films with or without adjacent layers of a different material ) surface parameters may have values quite different from the bulk .",
    "a significant difference found for the present case of af - coupled layers is that localized modes can be well separated in frequency even with bulk parameter values used at the surface layers , in contrast with f - coupled films . also , as might be expected , equilibrium spin configurations and excitations are dependent on whether the films are composed of an even or odd number of layers ( again in contrast with f - coupled films ) . due to physical geometrical considerations ,",

    "the main effect of the easy - axis anisotropy is to remove the degeneracies between some of the spin modes .",
    "this is a consequence of the reduced symmetry in systems characterized with easy - axis anisotropy compared with systems with easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "discussions of the symmetry properties of the bulk spin - wave modes can be found in ref . [ 13 ] .",
    "the lowest energy branch in each group is labelled @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and , @xmath185 . in quasi-2d systems",
    "these modes are two - fold degenerate and each mode represents a localized excitation at the surfaces of the film .",
    "the 18 other spin - waves branches within each group appear in the effective bulk continuum ( not shown ) obtained for the infinite system .",

    "[ q2d]a shows the splitting in frequency ( at small wavevectors ) of the surface branch labelled @xmath185 from the rest of the modes in the group . in fig .",
    "[ q2d]b results are shown for the spectral representation obtained from @xmath186 for the 20 low - lying @xmath187 spin - wave excitations around @xmath183 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show results for the spectral representation in layers @xmath148 and @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "the intensity of the spin - wave mode @xmath183 is largest in the surface layers @xmath189 or @xmath190 and decays extremely rapidly with distance away from the surfaces . in fig .",
    "[ q2d]c we show the amplitude @xmath191 ( integrated intensity ) of the surface modes as a function of the distance away from the surface .",
    "the results are symmetric about the center of the film and only the first 4 layers are shown . qualitatively similar behavior is obtained for the amplitudes @xmath192 @xmath193 ) .",
    "the surface modes have negligible spectral intensities for any layer @xmath194 . fig [ q2d]d shows results for the amplitude as a function of the layer index for the bulk mode labelled @xmath195 of fig . [ q2d]b . the modes appearing within the effective bulk continuum have amplitudes that vary in a wavelike fashion across the thickness of the film .",
    "the intensities of the bulk excitations at the surfaces is strongly dependent on wavevector and the assumed anisotropy and exchange parameters at the surfaces of the film .",
    "some effects of modified values of the surface exchange parameters on the spin - wave dispersion relation and the amplitude of the modes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ q2d2 ] for a quasi-2d system .",

    "the localized surface modes labelled @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and , @xmath185 are shifted to lower frequencies when the surface exchange parameters are less than the bulk values . fig .",
    "[ q2d2]b shows that the modes @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 , are localized near the surfaces of the film and are characterized with amplitudes that are orders of magnitude smaller than the case with uniform parameters throughout the thickness of the film . for a symmetric film with @xmath196 and @xmath197",
    "the surface modes are two - fold degenerate .",
    "however , the degeneracy is lifted when the surfaces are asymmetric .",
    "the results presented above outline the application of an operator formalism to calculate of surface and thin - film effects on the spin dynamics in af coupled geometrically frustrated triangular layers .",
    "this serves to extend our previously published work on f coupled films to the physically more relevant case applicable to a large variety of materials . through the use of illustrative numerical calculations differences in linear spin excitations for bulk , semi - infinite and thin - film systems having either easy - plane or easy - axis anisotropy and quasi-1d or quasi-2d exchange couplings are highlighted .",
    "a number of features of these results are of interest .",
    "in contrast with the case of f coupled films , bulk and surface mode excitations remain well separated in the case of af coupled layers even in the case where surface exchange and anisotropy parameters are identical to bulk values .",
    "differences also arise between these two types of interlayer couplings in the case of thin films . in the case of af coupling , the results are dependent on whether there are an even or odd number of layers corresponding to having compensated or un - compensated total moments , respectively . most of our knowledge regarding the sign of exchange interactions is based on rules which may not be entirely applicable to surface and thin - film environments.@xcite examination of the spin excitation spectrum in view of these findings offers a possible tool to distinguish the type of interlayer coupling .",
    "the present work also features a calculation of mode amplitudes .",
    "these exhibit a variety dependences through the thickness of thin films dependent on the mode in question and if the system is quasi-1d or quasi-2d .",
    "these results generally are applicable to a wide variety of af coupled layered triangular materials . among the abx@xmath0 compounds , csmnbr@xmath0 and csvcl@xmath0 are notable examples of quasi-1d materials with planar anisotropy.@xcite bulk excitations have been well studied in prototypical axial quasi-1d hexagonal materials csnicl@xmath0 and cscox@xmath0.@xcite examples of quasi-2d compounds with well established bulk magnetic properties include axial cufeo@xmath198 @xcite and planar vx@xmath198 and licrs@xmath198.@xcite most of the rmno@xmath0 materials exhibit planar anisotropy although characterization of thin films in this regard is ongoing.@xcite in ultrathin films surface effects dominate and spin reorientation transitions can occur.@xcite a number of possible experimental techniques to examine long wavelength surface modes are summarized in our previous work.@xcite progress using inelastic neutron scattering techniques to probe surface excitation in multilayer systems has been reported.@xcite potential extensions of the present calculations might be to include dipolar effects that can be important at surfaces even in af systems .",
