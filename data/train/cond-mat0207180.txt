    "the notion of a distance between configurations in statistical - mechanical and lattice - field models has been discussed by several authors @xcite , and the geometry that this endows on the manifold , @xmath8 , of the parameters characterising the models explored .",
    "this distance is measured using the fisher - rao metric @xcite , which is calculated from the fisher information matrix for the system of interest .",
    "when we consider a spin model in field , @xmath8 is a two - dimensional manifold parametrised by @xmath9 . in this case",
    ", the components of the fisher - rao metric take the particularly simple form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reduced free energy per site and @xmath12 .",
    "it has been suggested that in such a geometrization of statistical mechanics the scalar curvature , @xmath2 , of @xmath8 plays a central role @xcite . for a spin model in field , with the metric given in equ.([frmetric ] ) , @xmath2 may be calculated succinctly as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "since the only scale present near criticality for a model displaying a higher - order transition is the correlation length , @xmath15 , it has been hypothesised on dimensional grounds that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dimensionality of the system @xcite .",
    "if we assume that hyperscaling holds , @xmath18 , this leads to @xmath19    to test the behaviour of @xmath2 , one requires models which are solvable in field in order to obtain analytic expressions , and these are rather thin on the ground .",
    "indeed , @xmath2 has been calculated for the mean - field and bethe - lattice ising models @xcite and the above scaling behaviour verified .",
    "it has also been calculated for the one - dimensional ising model @xcite where it takes the remarkably simple form , @xmath20 in this case @xmath2 is positive definite and diverges only at the zero - temperature , zero - field `` critical point '' of the model .",
    "the correlation length is given by @xmath21 so that @xmath22 near criticality , and ( [ equscal ] ) holds there with @xmath23 as expected being zero @xcite . ] .",
    "a second noteworthy feature of the bethe - lattice and 1d ising models concerns the metric associated with ( [ frmetric ] ) .",
    "this metric is diagonalized using the corresponding renormalization group invariant .",
    "given the shortage of explicitly calculable examples , any further additions to the list would be very worthwhile in order to see which features in the models are generic and which are particular to the models concerned . in this paper we discuss another example , the 1d @xmath4-state potts model , where an expression for @xmath2 may be obtained in a very similar manner to the ising model ( which is the @xmath24 case of the potts model ) .",
    "we compare the properties of the curvature , @xmath2 , as well as the metric in the potts model and the ising model , highlighting both their structural similarities and differences in detail .",
    "the partition function for the 1d @xmath4-state potts model is given by @xmath25 , \\label{zpotts}\\ ] ] where the spins , @xmath26 , are defined on the sites , @xmath27 , of the lattice and where we have defined @xmath28 and @xmath29 for later calculational convenience .",
    "the model may be solved by transfer matrix methods @xcite , just as the 1d ising model . for general @xmath4",
    "the full transfer matrix @xmath30 may be written as @xmath31 diagonal elements , @xmath32 , and a @xmath33 factor @xmath34 : @xmath35 the partition function is @xmath36 and the eigenvalues of @xmath37 are @xmath38 , where @xmath39 \\ , ( y z ) ^ { - { 1 \\over q } } \\label{eigen}\\ ] ] and @xmath40 .",
    "the reduced free energy per site in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath41 , is thus given by @xmath42 .",
    "it is straightforward to use this expression for the free energy in equ.([equcurv ] ) to obtain the curvature , @xmath2 . in the current notation we re -",
    "derive the expression for the ising model between the ising and potts notations coming from the different spin definitions .",
    "] as @xmath43 the expression for general @xmath4 is similar in form to this , and is @xmath44 where the coefficients may be further broken down as @xmath45 and @xmath46 and are smooth functions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 and do not diverge for finite ( physical ) temperature or field .",

    "\\label{eta}\\ ] ] the expressions for @xmath50 and @xmath51 are very lengthy for general @xmath4 ( although still easily obtained ) so , for the sake of compactness , we write down only those for @xmath52 , which already display the generic features .",

    "in particular , the sign of the @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) limit of @xmath2 changes at @xmath64 , although the general morphology of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 remains the same for all @xmath65 as we see below .",
    "the correlation length for the one - dimensional potts model is defined in a similar manner to that of the ising model , @xmath66 so @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "we thus retrieve the expected scaling of @xmath2 for the one - dimensional potts model from equ.([equscal ] ) , namely @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "the exponents , as for the ising model , are @xmath23 .",
    "the general features of @xmath2 at non - zero temperature and field are perhaps easiest seen in a contour plot as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in fig.1",
    "we show the ising ( @xmath24 ) case which has certain non - generic features .",
    "the @xmath71 symmetry of the ising model is manifest as a @xmath72 symmetry in the plot of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , one can see that @xmath2 is positive for all @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath2 for a given @xmath47 value lies along the zero field line at @xmath57 .    in fig.2",
    ", @xmath2 is plotted for the @xmath73-state potts model , using the expressions given above for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we see that there is no longer a @xmath72 symmetry and that @xmath2 is _ not _ positive definite .",
    "this behaviour is typical of the @xmath76 case , as can also be seen from the @xmath77 results plotted in fig.3 .",
    "it is also clear from fig.3 . that the @xmath78 limit is negative unlike the @xmath73-state model , as indicated by equ.([rz1 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath79 the maximum of @xmath2 no longer lies on the zero - field line though its locus is still simply determined , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "we have concentrated so far on the curvature @xmath2 , which is of course a geometric invariant and independent of the particular co - ordinate scheme we use in the calculation .",
    "the properties of the particular metrics and line elements used in the calculation are also of some interest @xcite .",
    "the metric for the 1d ising model calculated from equ.([frmetric ] ) gives the line element @xmath80.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although this is clearly non - diagonal , the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as co - ordinates has the advantage of giving the simplified expression , equ.([equcurv ] ) , for @xmath2 since they appear as linear multipliers in the hamiltonian .",
    "the metric can be diagonalized by inspection in this case , and this preferred choice of co - ordinates turns out to be rather interesting from the physical point of view . if one considers a decimation type renormalization transformation on a 1d ising chain ( or ring ) where every other vertex is decimated and the length scale suitably adjusted , then one can exactly determine the relations between the renormalized parameters @xmath81 and the originals @xmath82 from @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the decimated partition function and @xmath85 is the original one .",
    "in addition to the parameter transformation there is also an unimportant overall scaling factor , @xmath86 .",
    "this transformation has an invariant @xmath87 , which is in effect encoding the invariance of the magnetization under the transformation since @xmath88 if the co - ordinates are transformed from @xmath82 to @xmath89 then , using @xmath90 one finds the diagonalized expression @xmath91.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the use of the renormalization group invariant , or alternatively the magnetization , also diagonalizes the metric for the ising model on a bethe lattice .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether this feature persists in the potts models considered here . although the potts metric and line elements are rather more complicated than those for the ising model , the same general structure is once again apparent @xmath92   } d \\beta d h \\right .",

    "the functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 are both easily calculable , but rather long , and are not reproduced here .",

    "it can be shown that the line @xmath102 ( i.e. @xmath103 or @xmath57 ) is a geodesic of the metric ( [ frmetric ] ) . in fig.1",
    "this is the line running along the ridge of @xmath2 . for @xmath104 potts models",
    "the local maximum in @xmath2 no longer lies at @xmath57 ,",
    "as is clear from fig.2 and fig.3 , however an analysis of the geodesic equations @xmath105 where @xmath106 parameterizes the flow lines , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , the @xmath109 are the various christoffel symbols for the metric of equ.([frmetric ] ) , and @xmath110 allows for non - affine parameters , shows that the line @xmath57 is still a geodesic . to prove this consider a vector field with a flow line along @xmath57 ( @xmath103 )",
    "this flow line has @xmath111 so equations ( [ geodesic ] ) become @xmath112 the first of these equations is a second order ordinary differential equation for @xmath113 which always has a solution .",
    "the second requires @xmath114 and it can easily be shown , using the metric ( [ betahmetric ] ) , that this is indeed the case .",
    "hence the line @xmath57 is a geodesic of the metric ( [ betahmetric ] ) for any value of @xmath4 .",
    "a different change of variable in the potts models brings one back to something very similar to the ising picture . if we transform @xmath48 to @xmath115 and leave @xmath47 untouched , we find that the local maximum in @xmath2 lies on the line @xmath116 .",
    "we show @xmath2 plotted against @xmath117 in fig.4 for the 3-state potts model for comparison with fig.2 .",
    "the picture is similar for higher @xmath4 .",
    "this transformation does not greatly simplify @xmath118 , @xmath119 or @xmath120 and we do not reproduce the expressions here .    in summary , although the choice of @xmath82 as parameters is natural in any calculation of @xmath2 , the metric is diagonalized for both the 1d ising and potts models when the renormalization group invariant , or equivalently the magnetization , is used as a co - ordinate instead of @xmath1 .",
    "the line @xmath57 is a geodesic of the metric ( [ frmetric ] ) for any @xmath4 .",
    "some years ago lee and yang @xcite addressed the question of how the singularities associated with field - driven phase transitions in ising - like spin models on lattices arose in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this was later extended by various authors to other models and to temperature - driven transitions @xcite .",
    "lee and yang observed that the zeroes of the partition function for a spin model in a complex external field on a finite lattice would give rise to singularities in the free energy . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "these complex zeroes move in to pinch the real axis , signalling the the onset of a physical phase transition . typically , the loci of zeroes are lines in the complex field or temperature plane and when the endpoints of such lines occur at non - physical ( i.e. complex ) external field values they can be considered as ordinary critical points with an associated edge critical exponent , usually dubbed the lee - yang edge exponent @xcite .",
    "the lee - yang zeroes for the one - dimensional potts model on a periodic chain with @xmath121 sites are given by the solutions @xcite of @xmath122 where @xmath123 are the eigenvalues given in equ .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) and @xmath124 is odd . in the thermodynamic limit the locus of zeroes",
    "is determined by @xmath125 or @xmath126 ^ 2 + ( q- 1 ) 4 z   = 0\\ ] ] which can be satisfied for complex ( in the @xmath24 ising case , purely imaginary ) values of @xmath1 .    unlike the ising model case , the lee - yang zeroes for the 1d @xmath104 potts models do not lie on the unit circle in the complex @xmath48 plane . however , precisely the change of co - ordinates we used in discussing the potts metrics in the previous section , @xmath127 , places them on the unit circle in the complex @xmath117 plane .",
    "if we associate a `` field '' with @xmath117 via @xmath128 , then purely imaginary values of @xmath129 give the zeroes , as in the ising case appearing in the hamiltonian . ] .",
    "from these considerations , it is clear that @xmath2 will also diverge as the locus of zeroes is approached for both ising and potts models if we allow ourselves the liberty of an analytic continuation of the field to complex @xmath1 values once @xmath2 has been calculated , since @xmath130 and @xmath131 are finite as @xmath132 .",
    "the presence of the square root means that the divergence is characterised by an exponent @xmath133 which is the lee - yang edge exponent for the one - dimensional potts ( and ising ) model @xcite .",
    "the status of these observations are a little unclear to us , since the calculation of @xmath2 has assumed a real metric geometry throughout and such an arbitrary continuation in the final expression might be rather dangerous .",
    "one is on slightly firmer ground with the ising model , since in that case the required continuation is to purely imaginary fields which correspond simply to a change in the signature of the metric in @xmath89 co - ordinates .",
    "the use of the @xmath117 co - ordinate in the potts case does , however , suggest a similar interpretation since there the zeroes occur for imaginary values of @xmath129 . with these caveats , it is nonetheless interesting that the lee - yang edge transition is still visible as a divergence in @xmath2 .",
    "we have seen that the scalar curvature , @xmath2 , of the fisher - rao metric may be obtained for the 1d @xmath4-state potts model in a very similar fashion to the 1d ising model since the free energy can be calculated in field in both cases using transfer matrix methods .",
    "although @xmath2 for the @xmath4-state potts model can not be expressed as succinctly as for the ising model it still has the same general form , @xmath130 , and diverges only at the zero temperature critical point of the potts model for physical temperature and field values , i.e. @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we wrote down @xmath2 explicitly here for @xmath52 , but noted it was a simple matter to calculate it for arbitrary @xmath4 .",
    "we observed that there were some features of the ising model @xmath2 which did not persist for general @xmath4 , as was clear from contour plots .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 was no longer positive definite and the @xmath72 symmetry of the ising model was no longer present .    the choice of co - ordinate scheme used in the calculation of @xmath2 was also discussed .",
    "we noted that although @xmath82 were a natural choice from the point of view of simplifying this calculation , the use of the renormalization group invariant in place of @xmath1 diagonalized the metric for both the ising and potts models . a different choice of coordinates , involving a rescaling of @xmath48 was also employed to identify the local maximum in @xmath2 . for any value of @xmath4",
    "the line @xmath57 ( @xmath103 ) is a geodesic of the fisher - rao metric .",
    "finally , we observed that if complex field values are permitted there is a divergence in @xmath2 at the lee - yang edge with an exponent @xmath133 .",
    "we have confined our discussion here to physical values of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath136 , in the potts models . since @xmath4 appears as a parameter in the transfer matrix solution",
    "there is in principle no barrier to extending it to general non - integer @xmath4 and also to @xmath137 .",
    "the @xmath138 limit of the potts model is related to percolation , for example , so the behaviour of @xmath2 might be of interest in this limit too .",
    "it would also be interesting to calculate @xmath2 for models with genuine transitions at finite @xmath0 , an exercise that has so far been confined to mean - field or mean - field - like spin models .",
    "possibilities which suggest themselves in this context are the ising model on planar random graphs @xcite and the spherical model .",
