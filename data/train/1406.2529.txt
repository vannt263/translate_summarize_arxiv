    "among the most challenging tasks in nuclear astrophysics is the theoretical description of a rapid neutron - capture nucleosynthesis process ( the historical r - process ) which is considered to be the origin of about half of the heavy element nuclides beyond fe in our solar system .",
    "this long - standing problem has been considered number three among : `` _ the 11 greatest unanswered questions in physics _ '' @xcite .    since the seminal papers of @xcite and @xcite , who identified the basic astrophysical and nuclear conditions for an r - process in explosive environments with high neutron density and temperature , r - process research has been quite diverse in terms of suggested stellar scenarios ( for representative reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "still today , a robust production site for a full r - process with solar - system - like abundances up to the actinide chronometers @xmath3th and @xmath4u has yet to be determined .    to experimental and theoretical nuclear physicists and chemists , modeling",
    "the r - process has remained a particularly fascinating challenge over more than 50 years .",
    "its detailed study in terms of isotopic and elemental abundances requires input of nuclear - structure data from the line of @xmath0-stability to the neutron drip line .",
    "simple parameterized , but nevertheless informative studies of the r - process have been presented by many authors based on input of just a few nuclear properties , namely the nuclear mass ( from which neutron separation energies @xmath5 and @xmath0-decay @xmath6 values can easily be calculated ) , the @xmath0-decay half - lives @xmath7 and the probabilities of @xmath0-delayed neutron emission @xmath8 . more elaborate , dynamical studies require additional nuclear quantities , such as reaction rates , fission barriers , fission - fragment yields and temperature dependencies of various parameters .",
    "a considerable leap forward in the basic understanding of the required astrophysical conditions at the time of r - process freeze - out for neutron densities occurred about two decades ago @xcite . at that time",
    ", nuclear data from earlier versions of our global , unified , microscopic nuclear - structure models for nuclear masses ( frdm(1992 ) ) , published in @xcite and @xmath0-decay ( the deformed quasi - particle random - phase ( qrpa ) model for gamow - teller ( gt ) @xmath0-decay in the form of @xcite , based on the original work by @xcite ) , together with the first few experimental data on r - process isotopes at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , were used for the first time in such calculations . among the main results of this investigation was a more detailed understanding of the impact of shell structure far from stability , considerably beyond the early recognition of the importance of spherical neutron shell closures .",
    "for example , the occurrence of the big r - abundance trough in the transitional mass region 115 @xmath11 was explained , for the first time the astrophysical consequences of a significant weakening of the @xmath12 shell strength below doubly magic @xmath13sn were predicted , and evidence for a dramatic lowering of the neutron - g@xmath14 orbital was found  @xcite . motivated by these findings we initiated a large series of nuclear - structure experiments at cern / isolde , which in the following years led to the identification of more than 20 new r - process - relevant isotopes in the @xmath15 mass region ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as the collection of all relevant neutron and proton - particle and hole states around @xmath13sn ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , including first evidence of the most difficult to identify p@xmath16 and p@xmath17 proton - hole states and their spin - orbit splitting in @xmath12 @xmath18 in @xcite .    also concerning the frdm(1992 ) mass model , over the next several years , step by step improvements of the frdm mass model",
    "have been implemented but only now finalized .",
    "similarly , numerous enhancements have been added to the initial qrpa model , and an extensive discussion of the improved version has been published in @xcite .",
    "we therefore have available new consistent sets of the most essential nuclear - physics data .",
    "with respect to our r - process parameter studies , since 1993 the site - independent waiting - point approach was steadily refined over the subsequent decade and applied to various comparisons with classical and new astronomical observations  @xcite .",
    "starting in the early new millennium , we have replaced the above approach with more realistic , site - dependent dynamical r - process calculations within the high - entropy wind ( hew ) scenario of core - collapse supernovae ( cc - sn ) . in this effort ,",
    "the basic basel model  @xcite has been extended and improved by @xcite , and is still being used by our group today . with this hew model , several important parameter studies",
    "have been performed to explain various recent astronomical observations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the present article is to present dynamical nucleosynthesis calculations within the hew scenario , with the use of a new , improved global set of nuclear - physics quantities based on the new mass model frdm(2012 ) and deformed qrpa calculations of @xmath0-decay properties .",
    "we point out the major improvements in the overall reproduction of the s.s .",
    "isotopic r - abundance residuals @xcite , as well as some remaining local deficiencies , which are smaller than previously but can provide important insights .",
    "our frdm and qrpa model combination provides not only masses and half - lives for the r - process calculation itself but many other associated quantities , e.g. deformations .",
    "this in - depth information permits us to propose more definite conclusions about nuclear structure far from stability through detailed comparisons between calculated results and observations .",
    "the first los alamos macroscopic - microscopic mass model , based on the modern folded - yukawa single - particle potential with a globally optimized @xcite spin - orbit force was published in 1981 @xcite .",
    "an enhanced version , the finite - range droplet model , frdm(1992 ) , which also extended the region considered to include all nuclei between the proton and neutron drip lines , was published in 1995 @xcite .",
    "this version now has been further refined during the first 13 years of the new millennium in 6 steps , 5 of which are enumerated in figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "the final improvement , leading to the new mass table frdm(2012 ) is a more accurate calculation of zero - point energies which further decreases the model error by 0.01 mev , and removes well - known discontinuities in @xmath19 . with the completion of these steps",
    ", we froze the model on 09/06/2012 , and are working on submitting frdm(2012 ) to atomic data and nuclear data tables .",
    "the accuracy with respect to ame2003 is 0.56 mev , but higher , 0.42 mev , above @xmath20 , the region relevant for the r - process .",
    "it is important to recall again that in our macroscopic - microscopic approach a mass table is not only a set of nuclear masses ( or total binding energies ) , but just one result of a larger theoretical and computational effort that also provides ground - state ( g.s . ) shapes , g.s .",
    "spins and parities , gross @xmath0-decay properties , decay spectra in terms of allowed gt transition log ft values to daughter states , and many other related quantities .",
    "there is also an associated single - particle - model computer code so that one can with straightforward development obtain matrix elements of other operators of interest , for example electric quadrupole moments and charge radii . for our current r - process studies",
    ", we have calculated new tables of @xmath7 and @xmath21 based on @xmath22-values and ground - state deformations from the new mass table .",
    "deformations determined from detailed calculations of multi - dimensional potential - energy surfaces are essential for obtaining realistic @xmath0-decay transition spectra from the parent ground states as well as from excited states of possible @xmath0-isomers .",
    "our work here is unique in the sense that it obtains all nuclear data needed ( ground - state deformations , masses , half - lives and delayed - neutron emission probabilities ) from a single , consistent , global model framework , which has been favorably compared to a substantial body of experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we obtain quantities not just for even - even nuclides , as do for example @xcite but also for odd - even and odd - odd nuclides , with level structure and the associated decay schemes based on realistic intrinsic deformations .",
    "this allows us to interpret the inevitable remaining differences between calculations and observational data in terms of physics not yet included in the model , or , possibly as issues with the experimental evaluations .",
    "excellent examples of previous such developments are , for example , 1 ) in theory : large differences between masses calculated in the original 1981 mass model @xcite and measured masses in the ra region were removed by inclusion of octupole - type shape distortions in the model deformation space @xcite , and 2 ) in experiment : masses that were in the ame1993 data base that deviated strongly from our calculations were removed or reevaluated in the ame2003 data base , see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "we show in figure [ 95vs12 ] the differences between calculated and experimental masses from the 2003 mass evaluation of @xcite in our current frdm(2012 ) and the previous frdm(1992 ) .        at first sight ,",
    "the new model may not seem significantly better than the old one , but this is a fallacy .",
    "the overall model error has been improved from @xmath23 mev to @xmath24 mev , that is by about 13% .",
    "although the region below @xmath25 , that is below neutrons mid - shell between @xmath26 and @xmath10 shows larger correlated , fluctuating deviations near closed shells and in the transitional region around the sub - shell @xmath27 compared to the heavier region , these deviations have minimal impact on our hew r - process calculations . in the heavier region above , the accuracy is significantly improved with @xmath28 mev .",
    "detailed areas of improvements are : 1 ) the bump of negative deviations just beyond @xmath29 has largely disappeared , 2 ) the negative bump at @xmath30 is reduced , due to the incorporation of axial asymmetry , 3 ) the large - amplitude fluctuations in the deviations present in the vicinity of @xmath12 are much reduced , especially below the magic number , and , as a final observation 4 ) the large fluctuations near @xmath31 have almost disappeared .",
    "moreover , other very short - range fluctuations in the deviations are reduced .",
    "these fluctuations give large errors in calculated mass derivatives , such as isobaric mass differences ( @xmath32 ) , neutron separation energies ( @xmath5 ) or @xmath33 values , since they are directly sensitive to the derivative of @xmath34 .",
    "these drastically decreased in the @xmath35 , @xmath36 sn and in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 pb regions . for @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "mev the @xmath19 rms deviation is 0.341 mev for frdm(1992 ) , 0.320 mev for frdm(2012 ) , 0.443 mev for hfb21 @xcite and 0.361 mev for hfb24 @xcite .",
    "however , the hfb models are not fully microscopic , because various phenomenological terms are added to the potential energy obtained as hfb solutions .",
    "such terms are the wigner term with several adjustable parameters , the hfb mass models are surely not microscopic self - consistent models , but rather macroscopic - microscopic just like ours .",
    "how the frdm improvements `` visibly '' impact the calculated hew r - process abundances are discussed later in section 3 .",
    "beta - decay half - lives @xmath7 and delayed - neutron emission probabilities @xmath8 are among the easiest measurable gross @xmath0-decay quantities of neutron - rich nuclei far from stability .",
    "apart from their longstanding importance for reactor applications , the two properties have also become important in interpreting nuclear - structure features far from stability and in explosive nucleosynthesis studies . theoretically , both integral quantities are interrelated via their usual definition in terms of the so - called @xmath0-strength function @xmath41 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "the half - life may yield information on the average @xmath0-feeding of a nucleus .",
    "however , since the transition rates to low - lying single - particle states are strongly enhanced by the phase - space factor @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the excitation energy of the daughter final states , @xmath7 is most sensitive to the low - energy region of the @xmath0-strength function .",
    "the @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probability @xmath8 is schematically given by the ratio of the integral @xmath0-intensity to states above @xmath19 to the total @xmath0-intensity .",
    "again , because of the ( @xmath44 dependence of the fermi function , the @xmath8 are mainly sensitive to the @xmath0-feeding to the energy region just above @xmath19 . however , taking together the two gross decay properties , @xmath7 and @xmath45 , may provide some primary information about the nuclear structure determining the @xmath0-decay .    since the first simple , phenomenological approach of the `` kratz - herrmann formula '' @xcite , with updated compilations by @xcite ,",
    "numerous theoretical models have been used to predict @xmath7 and @xmath8 values of unknown exotic isotopes ; however many of these calculations were limited to localized mass regions . for a detailed discussion of the significance and sophistication of such models , see , e.g. @xcite . in the present study , we use again the frdm - qrpa formalism as outlined in @xcite , now based on the frdm(2012 ) model .",
    "we again take into account allowed gt and ff transitions , and as previously introduce an empirical gaussian spreading of the individual gt transition strengths above 2 mev , with width roughly corresponding to the model mass accuracy .",
    "-decay half - lives @xmath7 for nuclei from @xmath46o to the heaviest known ones . in the upper part ,",
    "only the theoretical gt - strength is considered , whereas in the lower part gt+ff calculations are used for comparison .",
    "the respective total errors are given for three different half - life ranges , i.e. @xmath47 s , @xmath48 s and @xmath49 ms , where the last limit represents the usual range for r - process nuclei .",
    "for further details , see text and @xcite ]    .",
    "[ fig2 ]    in figure [ fig2 ] we compare measured @xmath0-decay half - lives with calculations based on our models for pure gt and gt+ff transitions , for nuclei throughout the periodic system . to address the reliability versus distance from stability , we present the ratio @xmath50 versus the quantity @xmath51 . as in our earlier work @xcite",
    "we find that the relative deviation between calculated and measured half - lives decreases towards smaller measured t@xmath52 , which means the error decreases with distance from stability .",
    "furthermore , our half - life comparisons show that the mean deviation of the calculated from the experimental values are approximately zero .",
    "this indicates , that no `` renormalization '' of the calculated @xmath0-strength is necessary .",
    "the calculated half - lives agree with the 272 experimental values listed in nubase2012 with @xmath53 s to within a factor of 2.68 .",
    "-decay neutron - emission probabilities @xmath8 . in the upper part",
    "only the theoretical gt - strength is considered , whereas in the lower part gt+ff calculations are used for comparison .",
    "the respective total errors are given for the whole ensemble of @xmath0-decay precursors , and for the limited number of r - process nuclei with @xmath54 ms .",
    "for further details , see text and @xcite ]    .",
    "[ fig3 ]    in figure [ fig3 ] , we compare measured @xmath0-delayed neutron emission probabilities with the calculations based on our two models for nuclei in the fission - fragment region . again , to address the reliability versus distance from stability we present the ratio @xmath55 versus the quantity @xmath51 .",
    "although for the @xmath8 quantity , we still have substantially fewer data than for the @xmath7 values , similar trends are observed when comparing to the predictions for pure gt - decay . when the ff strength is added we again find that the new calculation gives improved agreement with experimental data .",
    "the calculated @xmath8 values agree with the nubase2012 values to within a factor 3.39 for the 188 nuclei , where we in this case compare to the full half - life range .      the basic nucleosynthesis mechanisms for elements beyond fe by slow ( s - process ) and rapid ( r - process )",
    "captures of neutrons have been known for long time @xcite . however , the search for a robust r - process production site has proven difficult . still today , all proposed scenarios not only face problems with astrophysical conditions , but also with the necessary nuclear - physics input for very neutron - rich isotopes . among the various r - process sites suggested during the past decades ,",
    "the most recent ones supposedly favored in the nucleosynthesis community , are neutron star mergers ( nsm ; see , e.g. @xcite ) and magnetorotationally driven sne ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , even these scenarios are not fully convincing .",
    "on the one hand , nsms , apart from the still ongoing debates whether they can be responsible for the r - process observations in metal - poor halo stars in the early universe , the resulting abundance patterns of the heavier elements differ from the s.s .-",
    "this does not exclude the merger scenario ; however , it seems unlikely that the nsm r - process represents the dominant origin of the `` main '' r - component with a @xmath56 130 . on the other hand , magnetohydrodynamic sne explosion models ( still ) require extremely high magnetic fields and strong rotation to produce bipolar jets with possible r - process matter ejecta .",
    "however , also this promising scenario has been questioned , e.g.  @xcite and by the recent 3d simulations of  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our r - process parameter studies we prefer to use the neutrino - driven or high - entropy wind ( hew ) of core - collapse sne , which still is one of the best studied `` classical '' mechanisms ( for representative publications over the last two decades see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , until recently even the most sophisticated hydrodynamical models have predicted that the neutrino - driven wind is proton - rich ( electron fraction y@xmath57 ) during its entire life , thus actually precluding a rapid neutron - capture process ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . however , recent work on charged - current neutrino interaction rates ( see , e.g. @xcite ) seems to revive the hew scenario as a possible r - process site by predicting that @xmath58 can well reach neutron - rich conditions a few seconds after bounce , with minimal values of @xmath59 but still with too low entropies of @xmath60 .",
    "when considering in addition active - sterile neutrino mixing ,  @xcite even predict @xmath58 values down to about 0.31 . under such @xmath61 conditions ,",
    "the production of the light trans - fe elements from sr up to about cd would be possible .",
    "however , the heavier ( ree and 3@xmath62 peak ) elements observed in ultra - metal - poor halo stars ( see , e.g. @xcite ) would not ( yet ) be produced .",
    "furthermore , it is admitted that there are still various model uncertainties about weak rates , nuclear symmetry energy , weak magnetism , inelastic processes , etc .",
    "also the versions of the equation of state ( eos ) used in the above calculations do not seem to be the optimum choice , since they fail several tests related to symmetric nuclear matter , pure neutron matter and/or symmetry energy , and its derivatives @xcite .",
    "therefore , a final conclusion about the realistic @xmath63 parameter space of the cc - sn scenario can presumably not yet be drawn .",
    "given the present model situation , and since the main goal of the present paper is to compare the results with the old and new frdm & qrpa nuclear - physics input to r - process abundance calculations , to us it appears justified to use again our parameterized , dynamical hew approach , based on the initial model of @xcite , which assumes adiabatically expanding homogeneous mass zones with different values of the radiation entropy @xmath64 ( in @xmath65/baryon ) .",
    "the code used for the nucleosynthesis calculations ( see  @xcite ) has been steadily improved , for example to implement experimental data as well as more reliable theoretical @xmath0-decay properties in certain `` pathological '' mass regions ( see , e.g @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a better algorithm has been developed for the tracking of the @xmath0-decaying nuclei back to stability with time - intervals small enough to consider very late recaptures of previously emitted @xmath0-delayed neutrons from longer - lived precursors , such as 55s @xmath66br or 24s @xmath67i .",
    "value of @xmath68pt at the maximum of the @xmath69 peak . ]",
    "as has been outlined in detail in @xcite , the overall wind ejecta represent a superposition of @xmath64 components , where the main parameters @xmath70 , @xmath64 and the expansion velocity @xmath71 ( in km / s ) are correlated via the `` r - process strength formula '' @xmath72 .",
    "following our traditional attempt to find a possible explanation of the s.s .",
    "isotopic abundance residuals ( @xmath73 ; @xcite ) , eventually from a weighted superposition of several hew conditions and using for the first time the new frdm - qrpa nuclear - physics input , we have investigated the whole astrophysics parameter space as functions of electron abundance ( @xmath74 ) , expansion velocity ( @xmath75 .",
    "in this article , we present first results of our hew study based on the new frdm(2012 ) and qrpa(2012 ) nuclear - physics input as outlined in subsections [ 2p1 ] and [ 2p2 ] , and our `` standard '' choice of the astrophysical parameters of @xmath76 , @xmath77 km / s and @xmath78 @xmath65/baryon .",
    "this simulates `` hybrid '' r - process conditions with freezeout - temperatures ( when @xmath79 ) for free neutrons of @xmath80 for the@xmath81 abundance peak .",
    "for this nuclear and astrophysics input , we show in figure [ rabund ] the integrated r - abundances ( @xmath82 ) for our new ( 2012 ) calculations together with the @xmath83 values and our results based on the previous frdm(1992 ) and qrpa(2003 ) nuclear - physics input , both curves normalized to the @xmath83 value of ( 98% `` r - only '' ) @xmath68pt .",
    "both @xmath82 distributions represent results of the integration over the total mass region with a consistent weighting of equal - sized ejected hew elements with equidistant entropies as outlined in @xcite .",
    "hence , they are not composed of a superposition of independently fine - tuned fits of local mass regions , which may in each case yield better agreement with the @xmath83 pattern , as for example shown by @xcite for the @xmath84 r - peak or by @xcite for the ree region alone .",
    "therefore , at first sight the new overall @xmath82 distribution may not seem significantly better than the old one , but this impression is deceiving as will be discussed in the following .",
    "first , let us motivate why in figure [ rabund ] we only show the r - abundance pattern for the entropy range @xmath85 , i.e. the region of the hew components of the `` weak '' and `` main '' neutron - capture components .",
    "as is well known , in the hew scenario a significant overproduction of the mass region below @xmath86 seems to be unavoidable ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this result has commonly been referred to as a model deficiency due to the @xmath87-rich freezeout component at low @xmath64 , which  according to the definition given in @xcite  concerns the `` charged - particle '' and part of the `` weak '' neutron - capture components with the elements between sr and ag . in @xcite",
    "it has been speculated that one could avoid this discrepancy by considering hew ejecta as a mixture of correlated @xmath64 and @xmath70 components .",
    "however , in our present study we are again unable to verify this assumption . hence , even with the new nuclear - physics ( frdm(2012)qrpa(2012 ) ) input the local overabundance in the @xmath88 mass region persists .",
    "moreover , as is partly indicated in figure [ rabund ] , in this mass region there is also no improvement of the abundance fit relative to the earlier frdm(1992)qrpa(2003 ) input .",
    "however , in the heavier @xmath89 mass region where in the past in practically all r - process calculations with the frdm(1992 ) masses , the large abundance trough occurred ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , we now see that with the new frdm(2012 ) masses this discrepancy has practically disappeared .",
    "as has in principle already been discussed long time ago ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , this trough effect is due to subtle details in the predicted behavior of the decreasing absolute magnitude of the slope @xmath90 for odd @xmath91 of the r - process isotopes of zr to tc between the strongly deformed @xmath92 neutron mid - shell and the shape - transition region towards the next major spherical shell closure at @xmath12 .",
    "taking , for example the isotopic chain of @xmath93zr , with the frdm(1992 ) model predictions the r - process `` boulevard '' with increasing neutron - density or @xmath64 components was populated by isotopes up to odd-@xmath91 @xmath94zr@xmath95 with the predicted lowest @xmath96 mev and an unusually strong prolate quadrupole deformation of @xmath97 .",
    "thereafter , instead of an expected further decrease of the @xmath19 values , an increase of @xmath19 of 0.78 mev occurred in frdm(1992 ) between @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and @xmath19 remains large until the @xmath12 magic shell",
    ". the consequence of this behavior has been that the zr r - abundances pile up in the lower - mass even-@xmath91 `` waiting - points '' up to @xmath100zr@xmath101 ; and then the r - process directly `` jumps '' over 10 mass units to the classical neutron - magic waiting - point @xmath102zr@xmath103 . with the similar behavior of the @xmath90 slopes of the neighboring elements in this mass region , in the extreme case of an instantaneous freezeout",
    "no r - progenitor isotope is produced in the initial r - process `` boulevard '' between @xmath104 and the @xmath12 isotones of zr to tc ( see , e.g. figure [ rabund ] in chen et al .",
    "the resulting deep trough occurring under these simplified conditions can not be completely filled up by late non - equilibrium captures of free neutrons and/or the recapture of previously emitted @xmath0-delayed neutrons during a more realistic treatment of the freezeout phase , as one can see , for example from figure 24 in @xcite , and also from figure [ rabund ] in this article .    in the frdm(2012 ) , however , the description of this shape - transition region is improved .",
    "taking again the zr isotopes as an example , the r - process also runs up to @xmath94zr@xmath95 with its lowest , but now somewhat higher @xmath105 mev and a slightly lower  but probably still too high  deformation of @xmath106 ( cf .",
    "thereafter , again a local increase of the @xmath19 occurs , but less pronounced than in frdm(1992 ) .",
    "thus , in the zr chain the next populated r - process progenitor is @xmath107zr@xmath108 . with the similar behavior of the @xmath19 slopes of the neighboring elements , in the frdm(2012 ) several r - progenitor isotopes",
    "are populating the r - process `` boulevard '' in the @xmath109 mass region .",
    "as seen in figure [ rabund ] , this population together with a realistic dynamical treatment of the full freezeout phase now removes the earlier r - abundance trough .",
    "while the occurrence of this trough below the @xmath84 , @xmath110 peak in earlier approaches could be considered as a local `` eyesore '' in the calculated r - abundance distribution , its nuclear - structure correlation to the @xmath12 shell closure is of considerable importance for the r - process production of the heavy elements .",
    "it has been shown that the neutron shell strength below doubly magic @xmath13sn strongly influences the formation of this peak , and acts as an important bottle - neck for the further r - process matter flow via the rare - earth - element ( ree ) pygmy - peak region and the next major peak at @xmath69 to the actinide r - chronometer region .    in figure [ rabund ]",
    "we show the @xmath82 pattern of the @xmath15 r - peak for the above `` standard '' astrophysics parameter combination , again with both the old and new nuclear - physics input .",
    "it is immediately evident that with the chosen single @xmath70 component , no significant `` visible '' improvement of the @xmath111 peak is obtained when compared to the fit with the older frdm(1992 ) nuclear - data input .",
    "the maximum of the peak is already reached at @xmath112 , instead of @xmath113 , and the right wing of the peak is underproduced . apart from this remaining deficiency , however , the change of the overall trend of the @xmath19 values in the @xmath10 region with the new frdm(2012 ) , and in particular the trend of a decreasing shell - gap below doubly- magic @xmath114sn@xmath103 , defined as the difference of the @xmath115 values for @xmath12 and @xmath116 , has the welcome effect of reducing the earlier overly strong bottle - neck behavior of the @xmath12 shell . while with frdm(1992 ) the shell gap below @xmath117 was predicted to further increase with decreasing proton number down to @xmath118 , with the new frdm(2012 ) the trend is inverted , and is now similar to the predictions from the recent hfb versions and the so - called `` quenched '' mass formulas , such as etfsi - q @xcite .",
    "as we have shown already in  @xcite , in fact the correlated effects of nuclear masses ( @xmath5 values ) and @xmath0-decay properties ( @xmath7 ) have important consequences for the further time behavior and the amounts of heavier r - abundances in the matter flow out of the @xmath15 peak to the ree region and beyond .",
    "while the time interval needed from the r - seed composition of the @xmath87-rich freezeout to reach the maximum of the 2nd r - peak still is about the same ( for @xmath119 , @xmath120 ms ) for the old and new nuclear - physics input , the time to overcome the peak bottle - neck within the @xmath64 range @xmath121 is with @xmath122 ms for frdm(1992 ) already significantly longer than that for frdm(2012 ) with only @xmath123 s. this time difference then continues for the formation of the ree and the @xmath69 peaks , resulting in total r - process durations ( for the whole @xmath64-ranges of @xmath124 ) of @xmath125 ms in the past , whereas with frdm(2012 ) a `` speeding - up '' of the r - process is obtained with a @xmath126 ms .",
    "with respect to the exact shape and position of the @xmath81 peak , we can furthermore check why we do not meet the maximum of the peak exactly at @xmath127",
    ". a closer look at the @xmath19 values of the @xmath128 isotopes below @xmath117 for frdm(2012 ) shows the expected ( and for the r - process `` favored '' ) smooth decrease by about 1.47 mev between @xmath129sn and @xmath130rh .",
    "however , when continuing further down in @xmath131 to @xmath128 @xmath132ru and @xmath133tc , in frdm(2012 ) a sudden drop in @xmath19 by 0.55 mev occurs , followed by even negative @xmath19 values for @xmath134mo to @xmath135zr , which is not predicted in `` quenched '' mass formulas .",
    "quite obviously , it is this local @xmath19 behavior that causes the largest bottle - neck for the r - process at these mass numbers , resulting in the observed maximum of the @xmath82 peak already at @xmath136 with the frdm(2012 ) masses and the above hew conditions .",
    "we know from earlier r - process studies with the `` quenched '' mass model etfsi - q that relative to our standard conditions of a `` hybrid '' r - process variant ( with @xmath137 and a time duration until freezeout of @xmath138 ms ) for the condition of a `` hot '' r - process variant ( with @xmath139 and a time duration until freezeout of @xmath140 ms ) the maximum of the peak can be shifted from @xmath141 to @xmath113 and even slightly beyond .",
    "therefore , we have also checked the outcome of our hew calculations with the new frdm(2012 ) , and have obtained similar results .",
    "we thus conclude that within our hew model the correct shape and position of the @xmath84 r - abundance peak can only be reproduced by a weighted superposition of different @xmath70-components .",
    "the next subject of our discussion of the @xmath82 pattern is the pygmy - peak region of the ree in between the two major r - peaks .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ rabund ] , considerably improved agreement with @xmath111 is achieved with the new frdm(2012 ) input . with the frdm(1992 ) masses , the whole ree region of @xmath142 is underestimated by a mean factor of 1.67 , whereas with the new nuclear input the overall agreement in shape and abundance magnitude is excellent , with a mean factor of only 0.97 .",
    "the reason for this improvement clearly lies in the reduced bottle - neck behavior of the @xmath15 major r - process peak , which obviously has enabled a higher r - matter transfer to the ree mass region within the respective s - range of @xmath143 .",
    "this shows that earlier speculations that significant feeding from fission cycling would be necessary to properly fill up the ree region can be excluded .",
    "this assumption was introduced to `` repair '' a clear nuclear - model deficiency by addition of fission - material originating from unrealistically high @xmath64 components ( @xmath144 ) with unusually high weights of r - progenitor isotopes in the heavy actinide region . within the hew scenario combined with the frdm(2012)-qrpa nuclear - structure data the ree peak",
    "is well reproduced without invoking fission recycling .",
    "both our @xmath82 distribution for frdm(1992 ) and frdm(2012 ) have been normalized to the s.s .",
    "r - abundance of @xmath68pt . with this normalization",
    "the shape and position of the 3rd r - process peak are well reproduced , with a slight improvement of the rising wing of the peak with frdm(2012 ) .",
    "this shows that with frdm(2012 ) the shape - transition region before the peak and the @xmath31 shell strength are described correctly .",
    "in contrast , the shape - transition region above @xmath31 may still be imperfect , as is evident from the deep r - abundance trough in the @xmath145 region . just as in the @xmath89 region , the @xmath19 slopes of the specific elements of @xmath146er to @xmath147yb show a `` bump '' behavior beyond @xmath148 , thus precluding significant initial and final r - abundances below the pb region .",
    "in addition to the @xmath19 effect , probably also the onset of collectivity beyond the @xmath31 shell closure seems to set in somewhat too early .",
    "a possible indication for this speculation is that a hew calculation with frdm(2012 ) masses and spherical @xmath0-decay properties indicates a significantly better reproduction of the @xmath149 trough region .    as the last point of our comparison of how the @xmath82 agrees with the @xmath111 pattern ,",
    "we point out that the predicted underabundances for the pb and bi isotopes shown in figure [ rabund ] occur because here the important abundance fraction from the @xmath87- backdecays from the actinides has not ( yet ) been added .    as a brief summary of our article we find that the new nuclear - structure data base has removed some much - studied differences between calculated and observed s.s .",
    "abundances without resorting to arbitrary changes of relevant sections in the calculated data bases as has been the practice in many previous and present studies . with our use of a fully consistent model framework , namely the frdm(2012 ) and",
    "qrpa(2012 ) combination as input for r - process calculations , we again demonstrate that , coupled with detailed comparisons with astronomical and cosmochemical observations , this approach is a valuable tool for learning about both nuclear structure far from stability and the required astrophysical conditions for a full r - process .",
