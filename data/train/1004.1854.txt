    "not surprisingly , the study of contribution incentives has been an area of vital research interest in economics and related areas with seminal contributions to the topic over the last decades . a prominent example from experimental economics",
    "is the _ minimum effort coordination game _",
    "@xcite , in which a number of participants contribute to a joint project , and the outcome depends solely on the minimum contribution of any agent . while the nash equilibria in this game exhibit a quite simple structure , behavior in laboratory experiments led to sometimes surprising patterns see , e.g. ,  @xcite for recent examples . on the analytical side",
    "this game was studied , for instance , with respect to logit - response dynamics and stochastic potential in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose and study a simple framework of _ network contribution games _ for contribution , collaboration , and coordination of actors embedded in networks .",
    "the game contains the minimum effort coordination game as a special case and is closely related to many other games from the economics literature .",
    "in such a game each player is a vertex in a graph , and the edges represent bilateral relationships that he can engage in .",
    "each player has a budget of effort that he can contribute to different edges .",
    "budgets and contributions are non - negative numbers , and we use them as an abstraction for the different ways and degrees by which actors can contribute to a relationship , e.g. , by allocating time , money , and personal energy to maintaining a friendship or a collaboration . depending on the contribution of the involved actors a relationship will flourish or drown , and to measure the success we use a reward function for each relationship .",
    "finally , each player strives to maximize the total success of all relationships he is involved in .",
    "a major issue that we address in our games is the impact of collaboration .",
    "an incentive for collaboration evolves naturally when agents are embedded in ( social ) networks and engage in relationships .",
    "we are interested in the way that a limited collaboration between agents influences properties of equilibria in contribution games like existence , computational complexity , the convergence of natural dynamics , as well as measures of inefficiency . in particular , in addition to unilateral strategy changes we will allow pairs of players to change their strategies in a coordinated manner .",

    "are there natural improvement dynamics that allow players to reach a pairwise equilibrium ( quickly ) ?",
    "what are the prices of anarchy and stability , i.e. , the ratios of the social welfare of the best possible state over the worst and best welfare of an equilibrium , respectively ?",
    "these are the main questions that motivate our study . before describing our results",

    "budgets are called _ uniform _ if @xmath7 for any @xmath8 . in this case , unless stated otherwise , we assume that @xmath9 for all @xmath3 and scale reward functions accordingly .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the set of edges incident to @xmath5 . a _ strategy _ for player",

    "we are interested in the existence and computational complexity of stable states , their performance in terms of social welfare , and the convergence of natural dynamics to equilibrium .",
    "the central concept of stability in strategic games is the _ ( pure ) nash equilibrium _ , which is resilient against unilateral deviations , i.e. , a state @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for each @xmath3 and all possible strategies @xmath25 .",

    "we briefly consider maximum effort games with reward functions @xmath56 .",
    "for these games bilateral deviations essentially reduce to unilateral ones . hence ,",
    "pairwise equilibria exist , they can be found by iterative better response using unilateral deviations , and the price of stability is 1 ( theorem  [ thm : maxexist ] ) .",

    "note that allmost all of our results on the price of anarchy for pairwise equilibria result in a ( tight ) bound of 2 .",
    "this bound of 2 is essentially due to the dyadic nature of relationships , i.e. , the fact that edges are incident to at most two players .",
    "the case when edges are projects among arbitrary subsets of actors is termed _ general contribution game _ and treated in section  [ sec : general ] .",
    "here we consider setwise equilibria , which allow deviations by subsets of players that are linked via a joint project .",
    "for some classes of such games we show similar results for setwise equilibria as for pairwise equilibria in network contributions games . in particular , we extend the results on existence and price of anarchy for general convex functions and minimum effort games with convex functions .",
    "the price of anarchy for setwise equilibria becomes essentially @xmath57 , where @xmath57 is the cardinality of the largest project .",
    "however , many of the aspects of this general case remain open , and we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclude ] with this and other interesting avenues for further research .",
    "the model most related to ours is the co - author model  @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this model is very similar to ours , although there are many important differences .",
    "for example , in the usual co - author model , the nodes can not choose how to split their effort between their relationships , only which relationship to participate in .",
    "moreover , we consider general reward functions , and as described above , our notion of pairwise stability is stronger than in  @xcite .",
    "our games are potential games with respect to unilateral deviations and can thus be embedded in the framework of congestion games . the social quality of nash equilibrium in non - splittable atomic congestion games , where the quality is measured by social welfare instead of social cost , has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "our games allow players to split their effort arbitrarily between incident edges ( i.e. , they are atomic _ splittable _",
    "congestion games  @xcite ) , and we focus on coalitional equilibrium notions like pairwise stability , not nash equilibrium .",
    "in addition , the reward functions ( e.g. , in minimum effort games ) are much more general and quite different from delay functions usually treated in the congestion game literature  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite , bramoull and kranton consider an extremely general model of network games designed to model public goods .",
    "nevertheless , our game is not a special case of this model , since in  @xcite the strategy of a node is simply a level of effort it contributes , not how much effort it contributes _ to each relationship .",
    "_ there are many extensions to this model , e.g. , corbo et al .",
    "@xcite consider similar models in the context of contributions in peer - to - peer networks .",
    "their work closely connects to the seminal paper on contribution games by ballester et al .",
    "@xcite , which has prompted numerous similar follow - up studies .",
    "the literature on games played in networks is too diverse to survey here  we will address only the most relevant lines of research . in the last few years , there have been several fascinating papers on network bargaining games ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and in general on games played in networks where every edge represents a two - player game ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "all these games either require that every node plays the same strategy on all neighboring edges , or leaves the node free to play any strategy on any edge . while every edge in our game can be considered to be a ( very simple ) two - player game , the strategies / contributions that a node puts on every edge are neither the same nor arbitrarily different : specifically they are constrained by a budget on the total effort that a node can contribute to all neighboring edges in total . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there have been no contributions ( other than the ones mentioned below ) to the study of games of this type .",
    "our game bears some resemblance to network formation games where players attempt to maximize different forms of network centrality  @xcite , although our utility functions and equilibrium structure are very different .",
    "minimum effort coordination games as proposed by van huyck et al .",
    "@xcite represent a special case of our general model .",
    "they are a vital research topic in experimental economics , see the papers mentioned above and  @xcite for a recent survey .",
    "we study a generalized and networked variant in section  [ sec : min ] .",
    "slightly different adjustments to networks have recently appeared in  @xcite .",
    "our work complements this body of work with provable guarantees on the efficiency of equilibria and the convergence times of dynamics .",
    "some of the special cases we consider are similar to stable matching  @xcite , and in fact correlated variants of stable matching can be considered an `` integral '' version of our game .",
    "our results generalize existence and convergence results for correlated stable matching ( as , e.g. , in  @xcite ) , and our price of anarchy results greatly generalize the results of  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning the connection of our reward functions with the `` combinatorial agency '' framework ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this framework",
    ", many people work together on one project , and the success of this project depends in a complex ( usually probabilistic ) manner on whether the people involved choose a high level of effort .",
    "it is an interesting open problem to extend our results to the case in which every project of a game is an instance of the combinatorial agency problem .",
    "a related but much more coordinated framework is studied in charity auctions , which can be used to obtain contributions of rational agents for charitable projects .",
    "this idea has been first explored by conitzer and sandholm  @xcite , and mechanisms for a social network setting are presented by ghosh and mahdian  @xcite .",
    "in this section we start by considering a class of reward functions that guarantee a small price of anarchy .",
    "we first introduce the notions of a _ coordinate - convex _ and _ coordinate - concave _ function .",

    "note that _ every convex function is coordinate - convex _ , and similarly every concave function is coordinate - concave .",

    "[ def : classc ] class @xmath47 consists of all symmetric nondecreasing functions @xmath64 that are coordinate - convex . define class @xmath65 as the subclass of functions from @xmath47 that are strictly coordinate - convex .",

    "for every such polynomial @xmath72 we consider all possible extensions to a function @xmath73 with @xmath74 being nondecreasing and convex .",
    "we call the union of all these extensions the class @xmath75 . clearly , every @xmath76 since @xmath77 is convex .",

    "the same holds for the other second partial derivatives .      while we will show that the price of anarchy is 2 in section  [ sec : convexpoa ] , this result says nothing about the existence and complexity of computing pairwise equilibria .",

    "note that , in principle , there might be states that allow a bilateral deviation , but there exists no bilateral best response .",
    "the set of states resilient to unilateral and bilateral best responses is a superset of pairwise equilibria .",
    "hence , it might not even be obvious that dynamics using only bilateral best responses converge to pairwise equilibria .",

    "thus , bilateral best responses come in three different forms , in which the players allocate their efforts towards their joint edge ( 1 ) both , ( 2 ) only one of them , or ( 3 ) none of them .",
    "consider two incident players @xmath116 and @xmath5 in state @xmath23 connected by edge @xmath16 . to compute a bilateral best response from one of the forms mentioned above",

    "note that in case of equal reward a player always prefers to put the effort on @xmath16 , because this might attract the other player to put effort on @xmath16 as well and , by convexity , increase their own reward even further .",
    "similarly , we do this for player @xmath5 .",
    "this yields a pair of `` virtual '' best responses under the condition that the other player does not contribute to @xmath16 .",
    "now we have to check whether this is a bilateral best response .",
    "in particular , if only one of the players puts effort on @xmath16 , by convexity it might become a unilateral best response for the other player to put his effort on @xmath16 as well .",
    "if this is the case , the computed state is not a pair of mutual best responses , thus the most profitable candidate for a bilateral best response is of form ( 1 ) .",
    "if this is not the case , then by convexity one player is not willing to contribute to @xmath16 at all .",
    "hence , his virtual best response is a unilateral best response even though the other player contributes to @xmath16 .",
    "for the other player , this means that the assumption made for the virtual best response are satisfied , hence , we have found a set of mutual best responses of the form ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) .",
    "however , in this case , this set might not be a bilateral best response because the players do not improve over their current reward .",
    "we thus also check , whether a state of form ( 1 ) is a better set of mutual best responses .",
    "hence , we consider the state of form ( 1 ) and the resulting reward for each player",
    ". each reward must be at least as large as that from the virtual best responses , because otherwise the state does not represent a set of mutual best responses .",
    "if this is the case , we accept @xmath560 and @xmath561 as our candidate for the bilateral best response .",
