    "observations and theory demonstrate that star - planet interaction ( spi ) is a complex , yet potentially very informative probe of extrasolar planetary magnetic fields . in shkolnik",
    "( 2003 , 2005a ) , we reported on planet - induced chromospheric activity on two stars , hd 179949 and @xmath10  and apparent from the night - to - night modulation of the ca ii h & k chromospheric emission phased with the hot jupiter s orbit .",
    "the modulation was indicative of a magnetic rather than tidal interaction ( cuntz et al .",
    "2000 ) , such that the period of the observed stellar activity correlated with the planet s orbital period @xmath0 , rather than @xmath14 .",
    "ample observational evidence of tidal and magnetic interactions exists in the exaggerated case of the rs canum venaticorum ( rs cvn ) stars , which are tightly - orbiting binary systems consisting of two chromospherically active late - type stars ( e.g.  glebocki et al .",
    "1986 , catalano et al .",
    "1996 , shkolnik et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "although efforts to observe variable radio emission from the stars with hot jupiters have not yet been successful ( e.g.  lazio & farrell 2007 , george & stevens 2007 ) , there have been several additional observations that support the existence of spi .",
    "photometric observations by the most space telescope of several hot - jupiter systems , including hd 179949 and @xmath11  boo , suggest that stellar surface activity in the form of active spots may be induced by the giant planet ( walker et al .  2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "also , saar et al .  ( 2006 ) recently reported a possible detection of planet - induced x - ray emission from the hd 179949 system corresponding to @xmath1530% increase in x - ray flux over quiescent levels coincident with the phase of the ca ii enhancements at @xmath16@xmath150.8 .",
    "a statistical analysis by kashyap et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggests that the x - ray flux from stars with hot jupiters is on average @xmath17 3 times greater than stars with planets at larger orbital distances , presenting further evidence that close - in giant planets have a measurable effect on the activity of the parent star .",
    "one scenario of magnetospheric interaction proposes that the planet induces reconnection events as it travels through the large stellar magnetic loops ( cuntz et al .",
    "2000 , ip et al .",
    "2004 ) , implying that the resulting activity should depend on the star s magnetic field , the planet s magnetic field and the orbital distance with respect to the alfvn radius of the host star ( @xmath1510 stellar radii ) .",
    "novel research of the magnetic field topology of hot jupiter host stars is underway ( catala et al .  2007 , moutou et al .  2007 ) using zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi ) , which hopes to contribute to a more detailed understanding of spi .    a detection of a magnetic field of a hot jupiter would 1 ) provide a constraint on the rapid hydrodynamic escape of its atmosphere ( vidal - madjar et al .  2003 , 2004 ) which could affect the planet s structure and evolution , 2 ) present implications for the planet s internal structure , and 3 ) shed light on the mass - radius relationship of the known transiting planets ( pont et al .",
    "2005 , bakos et al .",
    "although the internal magnetic fields of hot jupiters are expected to be weaker than jupiter s due to probable tidal locking and slower spin rates ( sanchez - lavega 2004 , griessmeier et al .  2004 ) ,",
    "olson & christensen ( 2006 ) calculated that the magnetic field of a planet with even a tenth of jupiter s rotation rate would still have a strong dipole moment , when reasonably assuming that the convection is not highly modified by the rotation rate .",
    "also , the fact that both hot and very hot jupiters , such as hd 209458  b and ogle - tr-56  b , are detected at all means that they must have strong enough magnetic fields to balance the extreme stellar irradiation and cme plasma pressure to prevent destructive atmospheric erosion ( khodachenko et al .  2007 ) .",
    "we seek to probe hot jupiter magnetic fields in order to understand their formation and evolution .",
    "spi potentially offers an indirect way to detect , and with future modeling and observations , measure planetary magnetic fields .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that any magnetic interaction would be greatest in the outermost layers of the star , namely the chromosphere , transition region and the corona due to their proximity to the planet , low density , and non - radiative heat sources . with the commissioning of cfht s high - resolution chelle spectrograph , espadons , we are able to include several stellar activity indicators in our analysis to observe the interaction as a function of atmospheric height in order to model the energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms of this phenomenon .",
    "espadons wavelength coverage allows simultaneous monitoring of the ca ii infrared triplet ( irt , lower chromosphere ) , h@xmath8 , ca ii h , k ( middle chromosphere ) , and he i d@xmath18 ( upper chromosphere ) .",
    "our program stars have planets with orbital periods between 2.2 and 7.1 days , eccentricities @xmath19  0 and semi - major axes @xmath20 au .",
    "these systems offer the best chance of observing upper atmospheric heating . of the seven systems we observed with espadons ,",

    "this phase lead may help identify the nature of the interaction .",
    "for example , the offset from the sub - planetary point of a starspot or group of starspots can be a characteristic effect of tidal friction , magnetic drag or reconnection with off - center stellar magnetic field lines .",

    "ca ii data acquired in 2003 and 2006 of hd 179949 do not phase with the planet s orbit ( figure  [ hd179949_intk_2003_2006_orb ] ) , but both phase well with a 7-day period , likely the rotation period of the star . in figure  [ hd179949_intk_rot ]",
    "we fit data from each year separately with a rotation curve because the effects of differential rotation and the appearance and disappearance of new spots over the three years would produce variations in phase , amplitude and period in the observed modulation .",
    "note that the amplitude of the rotational activity in only 0.6 of that of induced by spi .",

    "while more photometry is needed to determine a rotation period conclusively , the modulated ca ii emission of this star in both 2003 and 2006 strongly suggests a rotation period of 7 days .",
    "similarly , previous ca ii data of @xmath10 and indicated possible spi ( figure 8 of shkolnik et al .",
    "2005a ) , yet our september 2005 data appears to vary with the rotation .",
    "again , the rotation period is not well known .",
    "henry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) quotes both 11 and 19 days , with a probable 11.6-day period from the @xmath36 index .",
    "we plot the 2005 data against the 4.6-d orbital in figure  [ upsand_intk_orb ] and an 11.6-day rotation period in figure  [ upsand_intk_rot ] . unlike data from 2002 and 2003 ,",
    "the 2005 data phase much better with @xmath9=11.6 d than with a planetary orbit .",
    "this on / off characteristic of spi observed in the hd  179949 and @xmath10  and systems is predicted by the models of cranmer & saar ( 2007 ) .",
    "they model the ca ii h & k light curve of a sun - like star with a hot jupiter interacting with the field geometry at various stages of the empirically derived solar magnetic field at annual steps of the 11-year solar cycle .",
    "they conclude that due to the complex nature of the multipole fields , the ca ii k light curves due to spi do not repeat exactly from orbit to orbit , and at times the planet - induced enhancement may disappear altogether leaving only rotationally modulated emission .",
    "this may explain the 2003 and 2006 disappearance of the strong orbital modulation seen in 2001 , 2002 and 2005 for hd 179949 .",
    "their models also show that for sparsely sampled data , the apparent phase shift between the peak ca ii emission and the sub - planetary point may fall between 0.2 and + 0.2 ( or @xmath21 72@xmath37 ) , consistent with the -0.17 phase shift we detected repeatedly for hd 179949 .",
    "we reported in shkolnik et al .",

    "2003 , @xmath28k@xmath29@xmath30=0.899 ) was modulated by stellar rotation with additional variability or flaring potentially induced by a hot jupiter .",
    "we find a similar effect on hd 189733 , a generally more active star , for which the average @xmath9 is well known ( 11.73@xmath210.07 days , croll et al .",
    "this star has relatively strong k emission with @xmath28k@xmath29@xmath30=1.231 and large intranight variability as shown in figure  [ hd189733_intk_rot ] which varies on time - scales at least as short as the length of the individual exposures ( 30 minutes ) .",
    "the average emission from night to night clearly varies with the star s rotation though with a lower amplitude ( 0.011  ) as compared to hd  73256 ( 0.045  ) , likely because the star is intrinsically more active , with a larger percentage of its surface covered in spots .",
    "this makes it difficult to extract any magnetic and/or tidal contribution to hd  189733 s chromospheric emission by the planet as no correlation is seen between the planet s orbit and the residuals to the rotational modulation .",
    "however , figure  [ hd189733_madk_orb ] shows how the integrated mean absolute deviation of the k line residuals from the global mean per night ( madk ) vary with orbital phase . though we only have four nights of observations spanning 1.4 orbits , there is a clear increase in very - short - term ( @xmath4030 minutes ) activity at @xmath41 .",

    "given the same angular frequency ( which is a reasonable approximation for the short - period planets in question ) , the magnetic dipole moment , and hence the magnetospheric strength , increases with planetary mass .",
    "this is observed for the magnetized planets in our own solar system , where the magnetic moment grows proportionally with the mass of the planet ( stevens 2005 ) , and more specifically , with the planet s angular momentum ( @xmath44 @xmath45@xmath46 , arge et al .",
    "since only lower limits exist for the masses of most hot jupiters and at such small semi - major axes they should be tidally locked ( @xmath47 = @xmath0 ) , we plot @xmath13sin@xmath4/p@xmath48 against @xmath28madk@xmath30 , the average of the integrated mad of the k line residuals per observing run , in figure  [ msini_madk ] .",
    "though we are able to include only one additional @xmath49 point ( hd 189733 ) to the original plot of shkolnik et al .  2005a , we continue to see an intriguing correlation between the planet s magnetic moment and the night - to - night chromospheric activity on its star . of our sample ,",
    "@xmath11 boo has the most massive planet and yet falls well below the correlation .",
    "this is consistent with the proposed alfvn wave model where the near zero relative motion due to the tidal locking of both the star and the planet ( @xmath50 = @xmath47 = @xmath0 ) produces minimal spi because of the weak alfvn waves generated as the planet passes through the stellar magnetosphere , thereby transporting little excess energy to the stellar surface along the magnetic field lines ( gu et al .",
    "if this correlation between short - term activity and planetary magnetic moment holds for more hot jupiter systems engaging in spi , this could provide an empirical tool with which to estimate the strength of extrasolar planetary magnetic fields .",

    ". there does not appear to be any correlation between the mean chromospheric activity and the level of night - to - night modulation , be it due to spi or stellar rotation .",
    "though 5-year baseline is a good start to tracking the intrinsic stellar activity cycles of these stars , limiting their periods to @xmath510 years , the variability from run to run may also be due to active regions on the visible disk of the star .",
    "we require more frequent monitoring over several more years to firmly say anything more about the activity cycle of any individual program star .",
    "a similar analysis to the ca ii k line described above was performed for the ca ii h , irt line at 8662 and h@xmath8 though with the normalization points set at 0.7 of the local continuum for the latter two .",
    "this level is within the photospheric damping wings of the line , focusing the analysis on the chromospheric core and excluding some blended and telluric lines . for both hd 179949 and hd 189733",
    ", there is a strong correlation between the residuals of ca ii k with those of the ca ii h and 8662 lines ( figure  [ correlations ] ) as expected given the common upper energy level of their transitions .",
    "however , a poorer correlation exists with the h@xmath8 lines . though h@xmath8 is often demonstrated to be just as good a tracer of chromospheric activity as ca ii , a recent analysis by cincunegui et al .",
    "( 2007 ) has shown that when comparing a sample of stars , the correlation between h@xmath8 and ca ii is the result of the correlation of each line with spectral type rather than with stellar activity . when comparing the variability of the lines for an individual star , there is no consistent correlation .",
    "this is likely the effect of the differing underlying formation physics between them .",

    "we leave the relative energy emitted in the lines and their implications for spi models for a later paper .",
    "the he i d3 line ( a blended triplet ) at 5876  correlates well with plage regions on the solar surface ( landman 1981 ) as well as with the ca ii h&k emission ( saar et al .",
    "it forms in the upper chromosphere and is thought to be back - heated by the stellar corona giving us a unique optical view of this hot plasma .",
    "the absence of he i absorption in non - magnetic regions on the sun and in other inactive stars indicates that he i has no basal ( acoustically heated ) flux level , unlike the other activity indicators in the visible spectrum , and is therefore purely a signature of magnetic activity .",
    "we show the spectral region near the he i lines of our program stars in figure  [ hei_6stars ] .",
    "the line is blended with the weak lines of fe i 5876.30 , cr i 5876.55 , and unidentified lines at 5875.76 and 5875.14  , both blended with telluric h@xmath51o ( moore et al .",
    "the imperfect removal of the telluric lines from our spectra left residuals at the level of @xmath220.003 of the nearby continuum .",
    "this made it difficult to analyze night - to - night variations in the stars that exhibit relatively strong variability in the ca ii lines , though the mere presence of the line indicates magnetic heating source , with strong absorption implying great activity .",
    "hd  179949 , hd  189733 and @xmath11  boo all have clear he i absorption while hd  209458 , hd  149143 , hd  217107 as well as our standard star 61  vir have only weak , if any , absorption .",
    "though night - to - night variability is difficult to quantify in hd 179949 and hd 189733 , there is a clear increase in he i d3 absorption on the night that each of the two stars displays its maximum ca ii emission , which do not occur on the same night . and .",
    "]    we measured the average he i ew by deblending it with the contaminated lines , a technique particularly difficult for the rapid rotator @xmath11 boo .",
    "the values are listed in table  [ targets ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the he i ew does not follow the power - law correlation with ca ii h & k emission observed by saar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for g and k dwarfs , but does display a strong correlation with the short - term activity metric @xmath28madk@xmath30 plotted in figure  [ madk_hei ] , where stars with more night - to - night activity have stronger he i absorption .",
    "the relationship between the he i absorption and stellar rotation period observed by saar et al .",
    "is also not obvious in our small sample .",
    "it therefore remains possible that the strength of the he i d3 line may predict whether a planet - bearing star will have night - to - night variability .",
    "when more stars with hot jupiters are discovered this may come in handy in helping to decide which systems should be studied further with intensive time - series observations .",
    "we have observed 7 stars with hot jupiters using cfht s chelle spectrograph espadons to search for night - to - night modulation of the ca ii emission for evidence of spi .",
    "four of these have been observed in our previous studies of time - varying ca ii h & k : hd 179949 , @xmath10 and , hd 209458 , and @xmath11  boo , and we have added three new targets : hd 189733 , hd 217107 and hd 149143 .    for our prime target , hd 179949 , we now have a total of six observing runs spanning 5 years . during four runs ( aug 2001 , july 2002 , aug 2002 and sept 2005 ) the ca ii emission varied with the orbital period of 3.092 days , with consistent amplitude and peak phase indicative of a magnetic interaction between the star and planet .",
    "the peak activity on hd 179949 in these epochs occurs at @xmath52 , leading the sub - planetary longitude by some 70@xmath37 .",
    "interestingly , this same phase shift is observed in the mad of the ca ii k residuals of both @xmath11 boo and hd  189733 .",
    "the phase lead can provide information on the field geometries ( i.e.  parker spiral ) and the nature of the effect such as tidal friction , magnetic drag or reconnection with off - center magnetic fields .",
    "hd 179949 data from the other two runs ( sept 2003 and june 2006 ) clearly vary with the rotation period of 7 days .",
    "a similar effect is seen on @xmath10 and where one of four epochs appears to be modulated by rotation rather than the planet s motion .",
    "this _ on / off _ behavior has been modeled by cranmer & saar ( 2007 ) to be an effect of magnetic reconnection with the stellar field as it varies with the star s long - term activity cycle .",
    "we present the expected correlations between the variability observed in the ca ii k line with ca ii h and irt 8662 , and a weaker correlation with h@xmath8 . though we could not accurately measure the variability in the upper - chromosphere line he i d3 ,",
    "we show that it has the potential to flag stars which might be active in ca ii k in on a night - to - night time scale .    to date",
    "we have observed 13 stars with hot jupiters at cfht and vlt , of which 5 appear to be actively engaging in spi : hd 179949 , @xmath10 and , hd 189733 , hd 73256 and @xmath11 boo .",
    "the activity as measured by the mean absolute deviation over a run on the first four of these stars correlates well with @xmath13sin@xmath4/@xmath0 , a value proportional to the planet s magnetic moment , and thus with the hot jupiter s magnetic field strength . because of their small separation ( @xmath40 0.075 au )",
    ", a hot jupiter lies within the alfvn radius of its host star , allowing a direct magnetic interaction with the stellar surface .",
    "although this correlation is tentative , short - term chromospheric variability may be our first probe of extrasolar planetary magnetospheres .",
