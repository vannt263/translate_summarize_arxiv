    "in recent years there has been an increased interest in the nonequilibrium josephson current in mesoscopic multiterminal sns - junctions .",
    "quasiparticle injection from one or several normal reservoirs coupled to the sns - junction leads to a nonequilibrium population of the current carrying andreev levels , and thus to a modification of the josephson current . as predicted by theory ,",
    "@xcite experiments show that suppression @xcite , switching @xcite and even enhancement @xcite of the josephson current under nonequilibrium is possible .",
    "the theory for the nonequilibrium josephson effect has been developed for mainly two types of junctions , quantum ballistic @xcite and diffusive @xcite .",
    "a growing experimental interest is however shown for multiterminal sns - junctions where the normal part is a ballistic semiconductor 2deg.@xcite in this paper , a theory for these type of structures is presented , and it is applied to junctions with and without normal reflection at the ns interfaces . for junctions with normal reflection , both specular and diffusive scattering is taken into account .",

    "the resistance of the point contact is assumed to be the dominating resistance of the junction , and the applied voltage thus drops completely over the injection point .",
    "zero magnetic field is assumed .",
    "a natural framework for studying multiterminal ballsitic two - dimensional sns - junctions is the landauer - bttiker scattering approach .",
    "the junction is described by the bogoliubov - de gennes - equation ( bdg ) , where it is assumed that the superconducting gap @xmath9 is constant in the superconductors and zero in the normal metal .",
    "hard wall boundary conditions for the 2deg are also assumed .",
    "solutions to the bdg - equation are matched at the ns - interfaces and at the three lead connection .",
    "it is assumed that all transverse modes couple equally to the modes in the injection point contact.@xcite    boundary conditions are incoming electron and hole quasiparticles from the normal reservoir and incoming electron- and hole - like quasiparticles from the superconductors at energies above the gap .",
    "knowing the wave function coefficients the current density is straightforwardly calculated .",
    "since the normal reservoir is weakly coupled to the sns - junction ( @xmath7 ) , the injected current is small and the current flowing between the superconductors is only the nonequilibrium josephson current .",
    "@xcite however , the coupling must be large enough so that the injected quasiparticles do not scatter inelastically before leaving the junction . under these assumptions ,",
    "the distribution of the injected electrons and holes are governed by the normal reservoir .",

    "the result that the current for a fixed phase difference oscillates periodically with applied voltage is still valid .",
    "whether rough 2deg - sidewalls , giving rise to diffusive boundary scattering , have a more profound effect on the current , remains to be investigated .",
    "it is known that in the case with the normal region being a chaotic cavity , the peak - like current density structure is completely washed out , and a gap opens up in the spectrum.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the nonequilibrium josephson current in long two - dimensional ballistic sns - junctions weakly coupled to a normal metal reservoir .",
    "the total current is given by a convolution of a single current density @xmath16 with the quasiparticle distribution functions [ see eq .",

    "it is found that the current density in all cases has a peak - like structure , with alternating signs of the peaks .",
    "the resulting nonequilibrium josephson current for a given phase difference thus oscillates as a function of applied voltage , with a period @xmath1 , and an amplitude decreasing with increasing voltage .",
    "this behaviour also carries over to the critical current , which changes sign as a function a voltage , i.e the junctions displays so called @xmath57-behavior .",
