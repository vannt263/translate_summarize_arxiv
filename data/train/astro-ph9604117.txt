    "the neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung radiation of electrons in the liquid and crystalline phases of dense matter is one of the main cooling mechanisms of neutron star ( ns ) crusts .",
    "this radiation has been studied in a number of works ( see , e.g. , itoh et al . , 1989 , and references therein ) .",

    "we will study the neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung of electrons in the crystalline phase of dense matter .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. , itoh et al . ,",
    "1989 ) that this process has two channels .",
    "the first one is the neutrino radiation due to bragg diffraction of electrons in a lattice ( `` the static lattice contribution '' ) .",
    "the second one is the neutrino emission due to absorption or creation of phonons ( `` the phonon contribution '' ) .",
    "it has been accepted until recently that both components have comparable intensities .",
    "however recently pethick and thorsson ( 1994 ) have shown that the band structure of crystals in a ns crust ( the presence of an energy gap in the electron dispersion relation at the brillouin zone boundaries ) suppresses exponentially the static lattice contribution .",
    "accordingly the phonon contribution dominates , and it will be the subject of our consideration .    the neutrino radiation due to the electron ",

    "the latter authors fitted their results by complicated analytic expressions and tabulated the fit parameters for matter with different nuclear compositions .",
    "these results are also included in the new review of itoh et al .",
    "we will show that , in some cases , the fits of itoh et al .",
    "( 1984a , 1996 ) are not too accurate .",
    "we will carry out more accurate calculations and fit the results by a unified formula valid for matter with arbitrary nuclear composition .",

    "the melting temperature of a classical one  component plasma of ions corresponds to @xmath32 ( nagara et al . , 1987 ) and equals @xmath33 note that the crystallization of light nuclei ( h , he ) is additionally suppressed by strong zero - point vibrations ( mochkovitch and hansen , 1979 ) .",
    "the most bound is the body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) crystal ( see , e.g. , brush et al . , 1966 ) .",
    "the binding of the face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) crystal is weaker but very slightly .",
    "one can not exclude that the fcc crystals appear in dense stellar matter along with the bcc ones ( e.g. , baiko and yakovlev , 1995 ) .",
    "we will consider the temperature range of crystalline crust @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the temperature below which the umklapp processes are frozen out ( e.g. , raikh and yakovlev , 1982 ) , @xmath36  k is the ion plasma temperature , @xmath37 is the ion plasma frequency , and @xmath38 is the ion mass . note that the debye temperature of a crystal is @xmath39 ( carr , 1961 ) . if @xmath40 the electron",
    " phonon scattering can be described using the approximation of almost free electrons .",

    ", we will consider two models of matter in a ns crust : ground state ( cold  catalyzed ) matter and accreted matter .",
    "the effects of temperature onto the nuclear composition will be neglected which is justified as long as @xmath42  k ( see haensel et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "both models assume that nuclei of one species are available in matter at any density ( pressure ) .",
    "this leads to jumps of nuclear composition with increasing density ( pressure ) .",

    "we will use the recent calculations of haensel and zhdunik ( 1990b ) , for describing accreted matter .",
    "the light elements are assumed to be burnt out in the outer layers of the ns crust while the nuclear composition in the deeper layers ( we are interested in ) is determined by a sequence of nuclear transmutations which occur in a sinking and compressing accretion matter and which depend neither on temperature nor on accretion rate .",

    "we can use the scheme of extended brillouin zones and the free ",
    "electron approximation for describing the electron states . in this case , the fermi surface and the electron dispersion relation are the same as for free electrons .",
    "this approximation is violated only in the narrow regions of momentum space near intersections of the electron fermi surface with the brillouin zone boundaries where the dispersion relation contains the energy gap .",
    "note that the interzone electron transitions which accompany the neutrino ",
    "pair emission due to the bragg diffraction ( section 1 ) occur just in these regions .",

    "the matter of sufficiently high density becomes solid . with decreasing @xmath29 , the crystallization boundary shifts towards lower densities .",
    "the accreted matter solidifies at somewhat higher @xmath157 since it contains nuclei with lower @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , if @xmath184  k and @xmath157 increases in the accreted matter and becomes higher than @xmath185 g  @xmath1 there occurs a series of transitions from liquid into solid and back .",
    "this effect is associated with strongly nonmonotonic melting temperature due to rapid changes of @xmath44 ( figure 1 ) .    according to equation ( [ 4 ] ) , the dependence of the neutrino energy loss rate @xmath183 on @xmath157 and @xmath29 is determined by the factor @xmath186 .",
    "if @xmath187 and @xmath57 were fixed , the emissivity @xmath183 would be displayed by horizontal lines in figure 5 .",
    "actually , however , @xmath183 varies with @xmath157 .",
    "the curves are seen to suffer jumps associated with changes of the nuclear composition and crystallization .",
    "the jumps due to variations of the nuclear composition are much weaker . in a crystallization point , the function @xmath57 and the emissivity @xmath183 decrease steeply by a factor of 1.53 but the general character of the density dependence of @xmath183 in the liquid phase and just after the crystallization is the same .",
    "this is because the neutrino  pair bremsstrahlung by electrons due to the coulomb scattering in a liquid is similar to that due to the high - temperature electron ",
    "phonon scattering ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath57 is rather smooth either in the liquid ( haensel et al .",
    ", 1996 ) , or in the high  temperature crystal , and it behaves as @xmath189 , in the first approximation .",
    "the crystallization jump of @xmath183 can be somewhat smoothed if we additionally take into account the exponentially suppressed static lattice contribution ( pethick and thorsson , 1994 ) . however , our preliminary estimates based on the approximate expressions given by pethick and thorsson ( 1994 ) and itoh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that the smoothing is not significant .",
    "with increasing @xmath157 inside the crystalline phase ( at a fixed temperature @xmath29 ) , the ratio @xmath190 generally decreases , and the low  temperature phonon scattering becomes important . in this regime , according to the results of section 4 , the function @xmath152 , and @xmath117 depends weakly on the parameters of stellar matter .",
    "then one has a strong ( @xmath191 ) suppression of the neutrino generation .",
    "the generation rate becomes a sharper function of @xmath29 and depends explicitly on @xmath157 .",
    "in the first approximation , @xmath192 .",
    "the suppression leads to a noticeable decrease of @xmath183 with @xmath157 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath183 on nuclear composition becomes much weaker , than in the liquid or high  temperature crystal .",
    "this explains increasing similarity of the emissivities @xmath193 for the ground  state and accreted matters in figure 5 with decreasing @xmath29 and/or increasing @xmath157 . at @xmath194",
    "k the difference of the emissivities becomes negligibly small .",
    "as follows from figure 5 , the neutrino emissivity @xmath183 is much more sensitive to the state of matter ( liquid or crystal ) than to nuclear composition ( accreted or ground  state matter ) .",
    "for instance , it is easy to calculate the emissivity @xmath183 for matter composed of iron nuclei @xmath175fe and show that it differs slightly from the curves presented in figure 5 .",
    "we have calculated ( section 3 ) the neutrino energy loss rate due to electron ",
    "phonon scattering in the coulomb bcc and fcc crystals of spherical atomic nuclei at densities @xmath5 g  @xmath195 g  @xmath1 and temperatures @xmath196 in matter of arbitrary nuclear composition ( section 2 ) .",
    "the results are fitted by simple expressions ( section 4 ) .",
    "combined with the results of haensel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which describe the neutrino emission due to the bremsstrahlung in the liquid phase ( @xmath197 ) , the equations obtained allow one to evaluate easily the neutrino energy loss rate due to the bremsstrahlung process in the wide temperature range @xmath198 , most important for applications .",
    "the main properties of the neutrino energy losses are analysed in section 5 for two models of matter in a ns core ( described in section 2 ) : ground  state and accreted matter .",
    "note that at very low temperature ( @xmath199 ) the neutrino emission due to the electron ",
    "phonon scattering may appear so weak that another neutrino generation mechanism becomes dominant  the coulomb scattering of electrons by charged impurities .",
    "the corresponding neutrino energy loss rate can be easily calculated , for instance , from the results of haensel et al .",
    "however the neutrino emission at these low temperatures is expected to be too weak to be of practical interest .",
    "the results of the present article can be useful for numerical modelling of various processes associated with thermal evolution of nss .",
    "first of all , we mean cooling of young nss ( of age @xmath200  @xmath201 yrs ) , where thermal relaxation is not yet achieved ( lattimer et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "the relaxation is accompanied by a cooling wave which goes from the stellar interior to the surface .",
    "corresponding variations of the surface temperature are , in principle , observable .",
    "the dynamics of thermal relaxation is quite sensitive to the properties of matter in the ns crust , especially to nuclear composition and neutrino energy losses .",
