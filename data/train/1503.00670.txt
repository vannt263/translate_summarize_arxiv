    "graphene is a two - dimensional allotrope of carbon which has become one of the most significant topics in solid state physics due to the large number of applications ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , bbbb ) .",
    "the carbon atoms form a honey - comb lattice made of two interpenetrating triangular sublattices , @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "a special feature of the graphene band structure is the linear dispersion at the dirac points which are dictated by the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands that form conical valleys touching at the two independent high symmetry points at the corner of the brillouin zone , the so called valley pseudospin @xcite . in the absence of defects ,",
    "electrons near these symmetry points behave as massless relativistic dirac fermions with an effective dirac - weyl hamiltonian @xcite . when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the graphene sheet ,",
    "a discretization of the energy levels is obtained , the so called landau levels @xcite .",
    "these quantized energy levels still appear also for relativistic electrons , just their dependence on field and quantization parameter is different . in a conventional non - relativistic electron gas",
    ", landau quantization produces equidistant energy levels , which is due to the parabolic dispersion law of free electrons . in graphene",
    ", the electrons have relativistic dispersion law , which strongly modifies the landau quantization of the energy and the position of the levels .",
    "in particular , these levels are not equidistant as occurs in a conventional non - relativistic electron gas in a magnetic field .",
    "this large gap allows one to observe the quantum hall effect in graphene , even at room temperature @xcite . in turn",
    ", the valley pseudospin can be used to create polarized currents in a similar way as the real electron spin is used in spintronics . by applying a local gate voltage to a quantum nano - contact in a graphene nanoribbon",
    ", valley filter can be obtained .",
    "due to the finite size of the graphene sheet , the transvesal momentum component are quantized .",
    "those states with a definite group velocity , depending on the  polarized gate voltage sign applied , can go through the quantum nano - contact with the result of a largest population in one of the valleys .",
    "altough the theoretical approach to distinguish carriers in the two valleys are known , the experimental procedure has become an attracting literature ( see ryz , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this valley pseudopin carries real magnetic moment , like real spin , supported by chiral orbital current , which can rise zeeman splitting and pauli paramagnetism in graphene @xcite .",
    "this magnetic moment can be used to couple it with a perpendicular magnetic field , which can be about @xmath6times the bohr magneton for low energy electrons @xcite . however , taking into account the total contributions of the valley pseudospin , there is no net polarization by the magnetic field because the contribution of the zeeman term to the hamiltonian has opposite sign at the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 points , which implies that the direction of the valley pseudospin polarization induced by the magnetic field cancel each other @xcite . in this case , the valley degeneracy is protected by spatial inversion symmetry @xcite . besides the usual spatial translation and rotation symmetries , pristine graphene hamiltonian is invariant under a large number of symmetries in the isospin spaces @xcite . by introducing the most general disorder hamiltonian @xmath7 ,",
    "pseudospin symmetries can be broken depending on which elements of @xmath8 are non - zero ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , local diagonal disorder can be obtained experimentally by irradiation @xcite , where carbon atoms are extracted from the graphene plane and adatoms or adsorbed species attach to the graphene plane schedin , or in which some carbon atoms are chemically substituted for other elements .",
    "these adsorbed particles can induce a local potential at the sites where they couple to the carbon lattice and change the on - site energy in the hamiltonian . for weak random substitutional disorder potential , intravalley mixing within",
    "either the @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys is possible , but not intervalley mixing . in the case of a random binary alloy disorder , a gap can be open in the fermi level due to the broken @xmath9 chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the peculiar behavior of the @xmath10 landau level in graphene , where its amplitude is nonzero only in one of the sublattices , namely , at @xmath2 sites for @xmath0 valley and @xmath3 sites for @xmath1 valley , combined with the random diagonal disorder can enhance the asymmetry in the valley amplitudes , which is related to the geometric nature of the bloch band and its relation with berry phase ( see @xcite , @xcite , thon , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this asymmetry can be detected by a population difference in the two valleys as a signal of orbital magnetization ( see @xcite ) and in turn , this asymmetry can be enhanced by an asymmetry in the relative density of states for both valley pseudospins . in this sense ,",
    "the aim of this work is to study the behavior of the valley pseudospin under a constant magnetic field and random binary disorder . in particular , self - energies and density of states for both sublattices and both valleys",
    "will be obtained by applying coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in this method ,",
    "the system is replaced by an effective medium with a complex self - energy that replace the disorder random potential .",
    "the value of the effective medium self - energy can be obtained by demanding that the average scattering of an electron by the surrounding medium is zero .",
    "improvement of the method for better understanding of non local disorder can be done by replacing the single impurity site by a cluster of atoms ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . due to the unbroken translational symmetry ,",
    "the embedded cluster method has been applied ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . to obey all the imposed criteria for the cpa ( see @xcite ) , the non local coherent potential approximation has been developed @xcite which is based in the approximation of continuous lattice functions @xmath11 by cluster function @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are points in momentum space that satisfy born - von karman boundary conditions . without taking into account the improvements of the cpa method",
    ", we will consider the results for low energy bloch electrons with self - energies in the full born approximation with nested diagrams included .",
    "this work will be organized as follow : in section ii , the magnetic green function with diagonal on - site energies will be computed for graphene . although this procedure has been studied without diagonal on - site energies , for a self - contained work this results will be generalized . in section iii ,",
    "single - site approximation will be applied and a system of coupled soven equation will be found and solved .",
    "the discussion of the results is shown in section iv and the principal findings of this paper are highlighted in the conclusion .",
