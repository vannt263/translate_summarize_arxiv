    "from different types of observations of dust in the milky way ( mw ) and other galaxies , we know that the gas - to - dust ratio ( gdr ) varies within and between galaxies .",
    "dust evolution models seek to explain and quantitatively reproduce these variations .",
    "most of these models treat the dust evolution problem averaged over a galaxy , and follow the basic template set by in which different species ( e.g. hydrogen or a specific metal ) travels between well - mixed states ( e.g. gas - phase outside of a galaxy or solid - phase in the dense molecular medium in a galaxy ) according to a set of differential equations .",
    "the current generation of dust evolution models include a more comprehensive and relatively well - constrained set of dust production and destruction mechanisms than the original , but are still focused on reproducing galaxy - averaged properties .",
    "as the number of destruction and production parameters that need tuning is quite large , there is more than one way to correctly reproduce a galaxy - averaged dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the current - generation models listed above can all reproduce trends that have been observed between the metallicity and gdr of a galaxy while disagreeing on what the most important mechanism for dust evolution is .",
    "one possible way to break this degeneracy is to increase the number of constraining observations by attempting to reproduce gdrs averaged over different phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of each galaxy .",
    "computing an ism - phase - averaged gdrs over a galaxy requires taking a comprehensive inventory of gas and dust over multiple phases , which requires observations of different gas mass tracers with sufficiently high spatial resolution to resolve the dense molecular phase .",
    "some of the most complete necessary datasets are available for the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , together  the mcs ) , which are two nearby , sub - solar metallicity ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the solar metallicity , respectively ) dwarf galaxies .",
    "the dust content of the mcs has been extensively studied as part of the _ sage _ @xcite and _ heritage _ @xcite programs . as part of these programs ,",
    "dust mass @xcite and gdr @xcite maps of the lmc and smc have been made .",
    "when these gdr maps are binned by ism phase , one finds different gdrs in diffuse neutral gas and dense molecular gas .",
    "however , the difference between these gdr values is not quantitatively accurate . due to degeneracies that are explored in detail in @xcite ,",
    "it is not currently possible to accurately compute dust masses in dense molecular gas from dust emission .",
    "one way to resolve some of these degeneracies is to measure gdrs in various environments in the lmc and smc using a method whose systematic uncertainties are different from those of the dust emission method .",
    "one of the aims of this study is to measure gdrs in the lmc and smc using elemental depletions derived from ultraviolet ( uv ) absorption spectroscopy .",
    "a depletion is the difference between an element s gas - phase abundance and its intrinsic ( i.e. combined gas - phase and solid - phase ) abundance . if one makes the assumption that the missing amount is entirely in dust , which is a reasonable assumption in the molecule - poor diffuse neutral medium ( dnm ) through which uv spectroscopy is possible , depletions can be converted to solid - phase abundances . combining the solid - phase abundances of the main constituents of dust",
    "yields a gdr .",
    "almost all depletion studies to date have focused on the dnm of the mw .",
    "the two main astrophysical results of the ensemble of mw depletion studies are that in a single location , elements with higher condensation temperatures tend to be more depleted @xcite and that the depletions of every element track each other and the volume density of the gas they are associated with in a consistent and continuous way @xcite .",
    "the latter result also implies that the gas volume density and gdr in a small amount of dnm are correlated .",
    "the smc is the next - best studied galaxy after the mw , with four sightlines along which some or all of mg , si , and fe have been measured @xcite .",
    "these four measurements hint at possible differences between the composition of dust in the smc and mw , but are inconclusive .    no other system has depletion measurements of multiple important dust constituents along more than two sightlines . there have been several one - to - two sightline studies of local galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) and many single sightline studies of damped lyman-@xmath3 systems ( dlas ) ( @xcite and references therein ) . because intrinsic elemental abundances in most local galaxies and all dlas are not available , these studies have relied on mw depletion patterns to interpret their observed gas - phase abundances",
    ". the present study will provide depletion patterns for two more galaxies at sub - solar metallicities , which may be more appropriate contexts for the interpretation of gas - phase abundances in low - metallicity systems .    in this paper",
    ", we present new measurements of silicon ( si ii ) , phosphorus ( p ii ) , chromium ( cr ii ) , iron ( fe ii ) , and zinc ( zn ii ) column densities in the lmc and smc .",
    "these measurements are made using 16 new and 84 archival spectra .",

    "in order to study the gas and dust content of the lmc and smc , we have obtained and analyzed 16 _ hst _ cos nuv spectra and analyzed 85 archival _ fuse _ fuv spectra towards the large and small magellanic clouds . from these spectra , we have measured p ii , zn ii , si ii , cr ii , and fe ii column densities .",
    "we have combined these measurements with h i and h@xmath0 column densities and photospheric abundances of lmc and smc stars from the literature to compute intrinsic elemental depletions , solid - phase elemental abundances , and gdrs .",
    "we see large variations in gas - phase abundances , depletions , solid - phase abundances , and gdrs from sightline to sightline within each galaxy .",
    "the depletion variations can be accurately described using a linear depletion relation of the type defined for the mw by @xcite , but with different linear coefficients .",
    "we find that the ism properties of the lmc are , up to metallicity , quite similar to those of the mw while the ism properties of the smc have some significant differences .",
    "when we compare gas - phase abundances in the lmc and smc with gas - phase abundances in damped lyman-@xmath3 systems , we find a considerable amount of overlap . within this overlap region ,",
    "the gas - phase abundance ranges of the mcs and dlas are very similar .",
    "regardless of whether this similarity is meaningful , we caution against assuming that mw depletion patterns apply to low - metallicity systems .",
    "below , we list a number of more specific results .    1 .   the minimum si depletion in the smc is consistent with zero while the fe depletion along the same sightline is substantial , suggesting that the composition of some dust in the mw and smc differs .",
    "the volatile elements p and zn have non - zero depletions along most of our sightlines through both mcs .",
    "the maximum p and zn depletions in the mw , lmc , and smc are the same to within the uncertainties .",
    "si , cr , and fe are systematically less depleted in the smc than in the lmc or mw .",
    "we find gdr ranges of 190 - 565 in the lmc and 480 - 2100 in the smc .",
    "these ranges are broadly consistent with gdr values from the literature",
    "the gdrs of pencil - beam - sized parcels of neutral medium vary by a factor of 2 in the mw and lmc and by a factor of 5 in the smc .",
    "the gdr variations within each galaxy suggest some combination of dust evolution in the neutral medium and rapid cycling of interstellar matter between the neutral medium and dense molecular clouds .    this research has made extensive use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france ; nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services ; astropy , a community - developed core python package for astronomy ; numpy and scipy @xcite ; ipython @xcite ; matplotlib @xcite ; and cython @xcite .",

    "the purpose of our model of a spectrum is to measure the total column density @xmath166 of each species @xmath167 in the observation - appropriate magellanic cloud .",
    "we marginalize over , meaning integrate over the posterior probability distribution of , every other model parameter .",
    "the other important high - level quantities are the ( ism absorption - free ) continuum flux as a function of wavelength @xmath168 and the distribution of @xmath169 as a function of doppler velocity @xmath170 . to convert these quantities to observables",
    ", we first use the @xmath171 to compute a transmittance function @xmath172 .",
    "then , we convolve the product of the continuum and transmittance with an instrumental line - spread function ( lsf ) @xmath173 to get a model flux @xmath174 . this model flux is the mean of a multivariate normal ( mvn ) distribution , from which we assume the data @xmath175 have been drawn .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath176 of this mvn distribution is the sum of a diagonal measurement uncertainty matrix @xmath177 and a not necessarily diagonal continuum uncertainty matrix @xmath178 .",
    "we fit for the ism absorption - free continuum emission using gaussian process ( gp ) regression and prediction @xcite .",
    "the regression and prediction were done using the gp code _",
    "our main motivation for using a gp rather than , for instance , splines is that the posterior predictive distribution of a gp conditioned on observations can be used to exactly compute the predicted values covariant uncertainties .",
    "this covariant continuum uncertainty is an important part of our model s error budget , particularly for high snr measurements .",
    "we run the gp regression on a subset of the data that we find , by visual inspection , to be free of ism absorption , then compute the predicted mean and covariance matrix of the full dataset .",
    "this subset comes as close to the ism absorption as possible in order to minimize the size of the prediction region . for the gp kernel",
    ", we use the sum of a square exponential kernel , a quadratic kernel , and the measurement uncertainties of the ism - free subset .",
    "we fix the lengthscale of the square exponential kernel to be 6 and fit for the rest of the kernel parameters .",
    "the dashed line in each panel of figure  [ fig : fit : sk116 ] is an example of a continuum fit .",
    "the uncertainty of the full spectrum model , which includes the continuum uncertainty , is shown as a gray region in this figure .    instead of explicitly modeling the transmittance @xmath172",
    ", we instead model the species column density distributions @xmath179 as a function of doppler velocity and use a deterministic non - linear transformation to convert that to @xmath172 .",
    "the column density distributions are split into spatio - kinematic groups @xmath180 , which are velocity ranges that we _ a priori _ assign to the mw , an i / hvc , or a mc , and the @xmath180 are further split into components @xmath181 .",
    "each component has a central velocity @xmath182 , a width @xmath183 , and , for each species @xmath167 , a fraction @xmath184 of the group - level column density of @xmath167 .",
    "the column density of species @xmath167 in component @xmath185 is then @xmath186 ; note that the sum of the @xmath3 for a single species over all of the components of a group are equal to 1 .",
    "the column density distribution of a species is the sum of the group level distributions , which are in turn the sum of the component level distributions .",
    "the column density distribution of a single component is @xmath187 and the full column density distribution of a single element is @xmath188    we use this two - level formalism because we believe that the groups are physically meaningful while the components may or may not be .",
    "the groups are physically meaningful because they correspond to different galaxies with reasonably well - separated systemic velocities .",
    "we believe that column density that has been assigned to a given group most likely actually arises in the corresponding galaxy .",
    "the components are not necessarily meaningful because , firstly , our instrumental lsfs are broader than the expected `` individual '' components , secondly , components that are distinct in velocity are not necessarily distinct spatially , and thirdly , the fragmentation of a continuous density into discrete subcomponents is almost always not unique .",
    "one consequence of the third point , particularly when the first point applies , is that we can not even define a unique _ number _ of components .",
    "this is especially true when our observations are a product of the transmission function , which is a non - linear transformation and superposition of the column density distributions , with the uncertain continuum . instead of trying to choose a fixed number of unphysical components , we marginalize over it",
    "this means that the dimension of our parameter space is not constant .",
    "we generate samples from the posterior probability over this variable - dimensional parameter space , using the reversible - jump markov chain monte carlo ( rjmcmc ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "rjmcmc is a type of mcmc that can be applied to variable - dimensional parameter spaces .",
    "it works by considering each fixed - dimensional parameter space as a subspace of some larger , overarching parameter space .",
    "one then defines different markovian steps for moving around within each fixed - dimensional subspace and between ` adjacent ' fixed - dimensional subspaces .",
    "further details of this framework are beyond the scope of this appendix and can be found in @xcite .",
    "we use these samples to build posterior probability distributions for each species column density in the lmc or smc and the model flux at each wavelength .",
    "the 16-th and 84-th percentiles of the column density posterior probability distributions are shown as error bars in figure  [ fig : ioncolumns ] .",
    "the 5-th , 16-th , 84-th , and 95-th percentiles of the model flux marginals are shown as shaded regions in figure  [ fig : fit : sk116 ] .",
    "these marginals include measurement uncertainty , continuum uncertainty , and the possibility of observationally similar but physically different velocity component structures .",
    "here , we provide the complete list of input parameters needed to reproduce the photionization calculations described in section [ sec : ioncorrections ] . these calculations were done using version 13.02 of the cloudy photoionization code @xcite .",
    "all of the models are of a constant - density cloud illuminated by a star @xmath189 cm from the cloud surface .",
    "we compute models with cloud volume densities of 0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 100 @xmath190 .",
    "the cloud composition is given by the ` abundances ism ' command , scaled to the appropriate metallicity ( 0.5 for the lmc , 0.2 for the smc ) using the ` metals grains ' command .",
    "we run each cloud model for a b0-type and an o2-type illuminating star of the appropriate metallicity using stellar atmosphere models from @xcite .",
    "in addition to the illuminating star , the incident radiation field includes the cosmic microwave background and the local mw radiation field ( ` table ism ' ) scaled by a factor of 4 in the lmc @xcite and 10 in the smc @xcite .",

    "we can split the model into four blocks  population level , study level , individual star level , and study - star level .",
    "the population level includes the mean abundance @xmath191 , the intrinsic star - to - star variance @xmath192 , and the between - study variance @xmath193 : @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the solar abundance of the relevant element , @xmath196 is the metallicity of the relevant magellanic cloud , and the notation `` @xmath197 '' , as in @xmath198 , means that the specified distribution is our prior for @xmath199 .",
    "the study and star levels include the bias terms @xmath200 , for study - wide effects , and @xmath201 , for star - to - star variations : @xmath202 the study - star level consists of observations @xmath203 and observational precisions @xmath204 : @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the typical precision of the measurements in study @xmath207 and @xmath208 is the dispersion in the typical precision .",
