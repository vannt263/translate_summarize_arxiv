    "gravitationally lensed quasars with multiple images provide a unique tool for determining the cosmological parameters independently of the classical methods . in particular",
    ", time delays between the images of a lensed quasar can be used to determine the hubble constant @xmath0 ( e.g. refsdal 1964 , grogin & narayan 1996 ) .",
    "extensive photometric monitoring of lensed quasars has been undertaken to obtain accurate light curves for the most promising objects .",
    "unfortunately , precise time delays have been difficult to obtain due to poor temporal sampling of the light curves , possible contamination by microlensing and short time scale events .",
    "= -4 light curves have recently been obtained for the quadruply imaged quasar pg  1115 + 080 ( schechter et al .",
    "1997 ) . the good time coverage , together with the fact that microlensing does not seem to significantly contaminate the intrinsic photometric variations of the lensed source , yield measurements of two time delays between three components of the system ( schechter et al .",
    "1997 , bar - kana 1997 ) .",
    "keeton and kochanek ( 1997 , hereafter kk97 ) showed that it was difficult to constrain @xmath0 because of degeneracies in the lens models .",
    "however , kk97 also showed that the constraints could be improved by measuring the position of the lensing galaxy relative to the quasar images better than was possible with the pre - refurbishment hst observations of kristian et al .",
    "( 1993 , hereafter k93 ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a better determination of the galaxy position and , thus , an improved estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "the observations consist of five @xmath1 band images of pg 1115 + 080 with a typical seeing of 06 - 07 . using sis , the tip - tilt adaptive optics camera installed at the cassegrain focus of the cfht",
    ", two 600s exposures were taken on the night of 1995 december 27 .",
    "the detector was a loral 3 , 2048@xmath42048 pixel ccd ( pixel scale 00865 ) .",
    "in addition , three @xmath1 band frames were obtained at the not in direct imaging mode .",
    "two 200s exposures were taken on the night of 1996 june 7 and an equivalent exposure was obtained on 1996 june 10 .",
    "the brocam2 2048@xmath42048 ccd camera was used ( pixel scale 01071 ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    = -6 the images were deconvolved using a new method , described by magain , courbin & sohy ( 1997 ) , that allows precise photometric and astrometric measurements of strongly blended point sources superimposed on a diffuse background .",
    "the main idea of this algorithm is to deconvolve by a psf narrower than the total observed psf so as to preserve a good sampling of the deconvolved image . as a consequence , 1 )",
    "the image can be decomposed in a sum of point sources , plus diffuse background and 2 ) the final resolution of the deconvolved images is _ chosen _ by the user .",
    "= -6 we chose the final deconvolved psf of the cfht as a gaussian with a full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 3 pixels .",
    "the not images were deconvolved on a grid of pixels two times smaller than the original frames ( i.e. 005355 ) in order to keep a good sampling of the lensing galaxy , and the final psf was a gaussian with a fwhm of 6 ( smaller ) pixels .",
    "this led to resolutions of 026 for the cfht and 032 for the not .",
    "the psf used to reach these resolutions was constructed from two stars about one magnitude brighter than the quasar image and situated 1  away from the lens .",
    "= -6 the weight attributed to the local smoothing of the background component in our deconvolved model image ( see magain et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for more details ) was chosen so that the residuals at the location of the lensing galaxy had the correct statistical distribution , i.e.  gaussian with a standard deviation of 1 ( in units of the photon noise ) . in this way we avoided under- or over - fitting in the area of interest .",
    "a constant smoothing term was used for the whole image and was adapted to the area of the lensing galaxy .",
    "this leads to slight overfitting of the sky noise farther away from the target and produces some noise amplification at low light levels .",
    "= -6 in the cfht images , the psf shows variations of the order of 510% from one side of the total field to the other .",
    "therefore , we allowed the psf to depart slightly from that derived from the two neighboring stars .",
    "the psf was constrained to deviate by the smallest amount consistent with an artefact - free deconvolution of the 4 quasar images .",
    "= -6 fig .",
    "1 shows the result of the deconvolution for a cfht and a not image .",
    "since the greyscale was chosen to display the full dynamic range , this image clearly shows that there are no `` deconvolution artefacts '' or `` ringing effects '' around the point sources .",
    "five images were used to measure the position of the lens galaxy . for each frame , the deconvolution procedure returned the coordinates of the four point sources , the deconvolved image as well as the image of the diffuse objects ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the latter was used to measure the position of the lensing galaxy .",
    "= -4 to compare our results with k93 s results , we transformed our coordinates to the coordinate system they used .",
    "the scaling factor and rotation angle were chosen to match the positions of the four point sources as well as possible , and the transformation was then applied to the galaxy coordinates .",
    "fig . 2 compares the new positions with the positions from k93 .",
    "the precision of the galaxy position has been increased by more than a factor of 3 , from 50 mas with the pre - refurbishment hst images ( k93 ) , to 15 mas with the new data and deconvolution technique .",
    "note that k93 used a pixel scale of 004389 , which gould & yanny ( 1994 ) revised to 004374 .",
    "table   1   summarizes the geometry of pg  1115 + 080 , in the same orientation as k93 , but using the pixel size given by gould & yanny ( 1994 ) .",
    "the galaxy position was measured on each deconvolved background by the first two authors independently , using either gaussian fitting or the first order moments of the light distribution , resulting in 10 measurements ( one for each author and each frame ) .",
    "we first averaged the two measurements for each frame and then computed a weighted mean of the 5 independent measurements , with a weight twice as large for the not images as for the cfht images because the latter are corrupted by psf variation across the field .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean is @xmath5 mas for the point sources and @xmath6 mas for the lensing galaxy .",
    "the effect of a variable psf was tested by performing numerical simulations which indicate that possible systematic effects could affect the point sources by another 2 mas and the lensing galaxy by an additional 10 mas .",
    "this leads to final 1@xmath7 error bars of 3 mas for the point sources and 15 mas for the lensing galaxy .",
    "the intensity ratio of a2 relative to a1 is given in table 1 .",
    "this ratio does not show significant variations among our frames or between our frames and the k93 frames , even though they were taken at four different epochs .",
    "this suggests that microlensing does not significantly affect the light curves of a1 and a2 in the @xmath1 band .",
    "the galaxy magnitude was derived on the not deconvolved frames by aperture photometry ( 09 diaphragm in diameter ) .",
    "the zero point was computed using several standard stars .",
    "images with a much higher signal - to - noise would be necessary to derive the shape of the galaxy .",
    "however , the galaxy observed in the present data is compatible with a fuzzy circular object , broader than a point source .",
    ".relative positions of the four lensed images of pg  1115 + 080 relative to component c ( in arcseconds ) .",
    "the intensity ratios in the i band are given for the not observations obtained on the night of 1996 june 7 .",
    "the magnitude of a1 is @xmath8 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     based on k93 galaxy position , kk97 found @xmath9 .",
    "the bayesian analysis using our new data gives a total probability distribution with @xmath10 , where these error bars incorporate the time delay uncertainties as well as some systematic uncertainties in the lens models related to the profiles of the galaxy and group and to the position of the group .",
    "our new deconvolution technique could be used to analyse all the images used for the light curves and to derive the independent light curves of a1 and a2 .",
