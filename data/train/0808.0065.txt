    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in lafeas[o , f ] has intrigued tremendous interest in layered feas systems.@xcite intensive studies have revealed that , by substituting la with ce , sm , nd , pr , and gd , @xcite the superconducting temperature ( @xmath6 ) can be raised from 26 up to 53.3 k , and even higher ( about 55 k ) under high pressure.@xcite as we know , the parent compound of the these superconductors has a tetrahedral zrcusias - type structure with alternate stacking of tetrahedral feas layers and tetrahedral lao layers , and favors a stripe like antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state .",
    "the parent compound is not a superconductor but a poor metal with high density of states and low carrier density .",
    "@xcite the ground state of the parent compound is supposed to be a spin density wave ( sdw ) ordered state with a stripe like afm configuration .",
    "@xcite superconducting occurs when the sdw instability is suppressed by replacing of o with f or importing o vacancies ( electron doping ) , or sr substituting of la ( hole doping).@xcite    very recently , the family of feas - based supercondutors has been extended to double layered rfe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( r = sr , ba , ca ) .",
    "@xcite the electronic structure of the parent compound has been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically .",

    ", we predict the most favorable doping structure .",
    "moreover , we find slight doping ( @xmath3 near or small than 0.25 ) tends to enhance the magnetic instability , while medium and heavy dopings ( @xmath3 near or larger than 0.5 ) tend to suppress it .",
    "bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 exhibits the thcr@xmath2si@xmath2-type structure ( space group @xmath12 ) , where feas layers are separated by single ba layers along the c axis as shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) .",

    "all structures are fully optimized until force on each atom is smaller than 0.01 ev /  . during all the optimizations and static calculations ,",
    "the lattice parameters are fixed to the experimental values @xmath15  and @xmath16 .@xcite although the lattice constants are different at different doping levels , the variations are very small , and we think they will not significantly change the electronic structures of the systems . to simulate doping , we replace one , two , three , and four ba atoms with k atoms , which corresponds to 25% , 50% , 75% , and 100% doping , respectively .",

    "the fe atoms in two planes are numbered as in fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) . except for the nonmagnetic(nm ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) states , the system have six possible afm states : square - like in - plane afm with fe atoms directly above each other in the c - direction aligned parallelly , afm1 ( ,,+,+,,,+,+ ) , and antiparallelly , afm2 ( ,,+,+,+,+,, ) ; stripe - like in - plane afm with fe atoms directly above each other in the c - direction aligned parallelly afm3 ( ,+,,+,+,,+, ) , and antiparallelly afm4 ( ,+,,+,,+,,+,,+ ) ; one plane with square - like afm and the other with stripe - like afm , afm5 ( ,,+,+,+,,+, ) ; and in - plane fm with two planes aligned antiparallelly , afm6 ( ,,,,+,+,+,+ ) .",

    "the instabilities of nm state to other magnetic states , and the corresponding magnetic moment of fe in these magnetic states are listed in table [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "we find very weak instabilities from nm to fm and afm6 , a stronger one to afm5 , and the strongest instability to afm4 , which is the ground state .",
    "this ground state is consistent with the previous experimental result@xcite and other calculations@xcite , where the ground state of bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 was found to be stripe - like afm with fe atoms aligned antiparallelly to each other in c - direction .",
    "the magnetic moment we obtained for the ground state is about 0.83 @xmath5/fe , comparing with that in other calculations ( about 2.67 @xmath5/fe ) , our result agrees much better with the experimental one ( 0.87 @xmath5/fe ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have tested the effects of different u@xmath20 on the magnetic moments and total energies .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the magnetic moment changes monotonously with u@xmath20 , and a slight change of the u@xmath20 will significantly alter the magnetic moment .",
    "similar results have been found in refeaso , @xcite a negative effective u thus may be a common feature of the feas layers .",
    ", width=321 ]    the density of states ( dos ) of the afm4 state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , similar to that in refeaso , the contributions from fe and as dominate the dos near the fermi level , and the density of states at the fermi level ( n@xmath22 ) is 5.65 .",

    "[ fig3]b , the small dispersions along c axis ( from @xmath23 to z and a to m ) indicate the interactions between layers are small .",
    "there are three bands cross the fermi level , one electron band around @xmath23 to x , and two hole bands around @xmath23 to z and m to @xmath23 , which indicates the multi - band feature of the system .",

    "k replace of ba ( ba@xmath25k@xmath21fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ) , the k site has two choices , one is in the layer of z=0.0 ( case1 ) , and the other is in the layer of z=0.5 ( case2 ) , where z is the direct coordinate along the c axis of the supercell .",
    "the total energies of these two cases are very close , for nm state , the total energy of case 1 is about 0.2 mev higher than that of case2 .",
    "the results of magnetic instabilities and the magnetic moment on fe of these two cases are listed in table [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "we find the afm3 state disappears in case1 , while in case2 , it is the state has the lowest energy , and the magnetic moment on fe is not significantly changed in the states with the in - plane stripe - like afm .",
    "the dos and band structures of afm4 of case1 and afm3 of case2 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . compared with the parent compound ,",
    "the shape of the dos does not alter significantly , but the states near the fermi level are shifted up , resulted in an increase of the n@xmath22 , which is 9.46 in afm4 of case1 , and 9.18 in afm3 of case2 . in the band structures , the changes of the states near the fermi level is much clearer , in both afm4 of case1 and afm3 of case2 , only two hole bands across the fermi level , this is accord with the experimental results where hole pockets at @xmath23 sites become larger after doping.@xcite    k@xmath25fe@xmath2as@xmath2.,width=321 ]    then , we go to the case of ba@xmath24k@xmath24fe@xmath2as@xmath2",
    ". there are three possible ways of substitution for k , that is two in the layer z=0.0 ( case 1 ) , two in the layer z=0.5 ( case 2 ) and one in each layer ( case 3 ) .",
    "the calculations show case 3 is the most favorable in the energy point of view , for nm state , the total energy of case 3 is about 0.19 ev lower than that of case 1 and case 2 per supercell .",
    "thus , here we discuss the magnetic and electronic properties of case3 only .",
    "as shown in table [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , although afm3 is the state with the lowest energy , afm4 is very close to it , and the magnetic moments on fe of these two states are almost the same .",
    "so afm3 and afm4 may co - exist at this doping level , competing with each other . the dos and band structure of afm3 and afm4 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , though the shape of the dos is similar to former cases , the states are further slightly shifted up with n@xmath22 of 12.84 for afm3 and 13.13 for afm4 . in the band structure , there are 3 bands across the fermi level .",
    ", width=321 ]    for ba@xmath21k@xmath25fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , k atoms have two choices , one is two atoms in layer z=0.0 , and the other one in layer z=0.5 ( case 1 ) , the other choice is two in layer z=0.5 , and the other one in layer z=0.0 ( case 2 ) . in spin - unpolarized calculations ,",
    "these two cases have almost the same total energy ( case 1 lower about 3.65 mev than case 2 ) , so these two structures may co - exist at this doping level .",
    "although with very close energy , their magnetic structures are different . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , we can see the afm3 state is not exist in case1 , while in case2 , it has the lowest energy . and",
    "again , we find the magnetic moments on fe of the states with the in - plane stripe - like afm are almost the same . besides , at this doping level , we find the instability from nm to fm is increased , close to that of nm to afm4 or afm3 .",
    "so here , the system may have competing orders of fm , afm3 , and afm4 . in all states of case 1 and case 2 , the afm3 of case 2 has the lowest energy , the dos and band structure of this state are plotted in fig .",
    "the n@xmath22 in this case is increased to 15.24 , and the bands near the fermi level are moved up , exhibiting 5 bands across the fermi level .",
    "lastly , although the 100% percent doping is hard to achieve in experiments , we still investigate this kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 case for consistency .",
    "the magnetic instabilities and magnetic moments on fe atoms are given in table [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , we find the nm to afm6 has the strongest instability here , with afm1 the next .",
    "this is different with the above cases , where the states with in - plane stripe - like afm is always the state with the lowest energy .",

    "[ fig7 ] . comparing with the dos of ba@xmath21k@xmath25fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , the n@xmath22",
    "is slightly decreased to 14.70 , and 5 bands cross the fermi level here .    from the results illustrated above",
    ", we find the magnetic properties of ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 is very sensitive to the doping geometry , and the magnetic moments highly depend on the ordering .",
    "these properties imply that the magnetism of these compounds is of itinerant character .",
    "@xcite no matter the interlayer alignment of the states with in - plane stripe - like afm , they have almost the same magnetic moments on fe atoms .",
    "doping does not change the nature that the dos near the fermi level is dominated by the feas layer .",
    "it results in an increase of the n@xmath22 by shifting up the bands across the fermi level .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed first - principles calculation for ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 systems within the gga+u method . using a negative @xmath18 of @xmath26 ev , we find the same sdw ground state with experiment for the parent compound , and the magnetic moment on fe is very close to the experimental value ( cal .",
