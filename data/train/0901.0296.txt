    "we , at both the individual and societal levels , have to constantly make decisions on how we should distribute our limited resources and time .",
    "we need to make choices as to who to hire , elect , buy from , get information from , award grants to , or make friends with . in this competitive landscape ,",
    "each candidate touts a resume highlighting _ experience _  a more easily quantifiable metric that summarizes past achievements , e.g. , the total number of clients a service provider has served , or the years a prospective employee has spent at similar jobs, and _ talent _ or inherent _ fitness _  a more subjective metric that indicates how well the candidates might perform in the future , e.g. , especial pedigree or degree from a prestigious college , or knowledge of a brand new technology , or an articulation of an ideal that captures the imagination .",
    "how we strike a balance between entitlement / experience and fitness / potential is a key determining factor in how wealth and power get distributed in a society , and how nimble it is in adapting to changes .",
    "too much emphasis on experience alone could lead to an ossified social structure that lacks innovation and can collapse dramatically when confronted with change ; the world history is littered with numerous instances of failed societies who had chosen such a path .",
    "the opposite extreme of letting only promising upstarts rule , can equally easily lead to a state of anarchy with no dominant institutions to hold the society together ; the frequent failures of well - intentioned revolutions that supplant existing institutions en masse and make fresh starts , provide eloquent testimonies to the perils of such a path .",
    "a society - wide quantitative study of how the experience vs. talent question is resolved , however , has been difficult to perform because of the obvious lack of concrete data .",
    "the world wide web ( www ) provides a unique opportunity in this regard .",
    "it has emerged as a symbiotic socioeconomic entity , enabling new forms of commerce and social intercourse , while being constantly updated and modified by the activities that it itself enables . given the web s organic nature , its evolution , structure , and",
    "information dynamics should reflect many of the same dynamics that underlie its real - world counterparts , i.e. , our social and economic institutions .",
    "thus , we ask how does this thriving cyber - society deal with the experience vs. talent issue , and how this interplay influences its own structure .",
    "the unprecedented scale and transparency of the activities on the web can provide data that hitherto has been unavailable .",
    "the web is typically modeled as an evolving network whose nodes are web pages and whose edges are url links or hyperlinks . a web page s in - degree ( i.e. , the number of other pages that provide links to it ) is a good approximation to its ability to compete , since heavily linked web documents are entitled to numerous benefits , such as being easier to find via random browsing , being possibly ranked higher in search engine results , attracting higher traffic and , thus , higher revenue through online advertisements .",
    "thus _ the degree of a node _ can be considered _ as a proxy of its experience _ , and it is a reflection of its entitlement , status and accomplishments to date .    in fact ,",
    "motivated by a power - law ( pl ) distribution of the degree of nodes in the web graph ( i.e. , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes node degree and @xmath2 is the power law ( pl ) exponent ) , the principle of preferential attachment ( pa ) , known to sociologists and economists for decades ( e.g. , as the `` cumulative advantage '' or the `` rich gets richer '' principle@xcite ) , was proposed as a dominant dynamic in the web @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite modeled web growth in terms of growth in the sizes of web sites / domains , which is identical to the model used by willis and yule @xcite in 1922 to explain the pl in the sizes of the genus .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the yule s model and the simon s model @xcite are equivalent to each other , and both rely on the cumulative advantage principle .",
    "hence , we refer to both the models introduced in @xcite and in @xcite as the pa model .",
    "alternate local dynamical models of the web , e.g. , via copying of links@xcite ( again , inspired by analogous social dynamics , such as referral services ) , account for additional characteristics of the web graph , such as high clustering coefficients and bipartite clique communities , while still retaining the global pa mechanism .",
    "the pa or equivalent models , however , imply that the scale is heavily tilted towards experience : the more experienced or older a page is , the more resources it will get and the more dominant it will become . for example , pa predicts that almost all nodes with high in - degree are old nodes ( disallowing newcomers to catch up ) , and that the degree distribution of pages introduced at the same time will be an exponential one , with very low variance .",
    "this extreme bias of the model was quickly realized and @xcite presented empirical data showing that the degree distribution of nodes of the same age has a very high variance ; they also introduced a fitness or talent parameter allowing different domains to grow at different rates to theoretically account for the high variance @xcite .",
    "this also prompted a number of researchers to propose @xcite and explore @xcite the `` preferential attachment with fitness '' dynamical model in which a node @xmath3 acquires a new link with probability proportional to @xmath4 , the product of its current number of links @xmath5 and its intrinsic _ fitness or talent _ @xmath6 .",
    "in such a linear fitness model , the degree distribution and the structure of the resulting network _ depends on the distribution of the talent parameter _",
    ", @xmath6 , and thus , without any knowledge of the exact distribution , one can not quite say how exactly the talent vs. experience issue gets played out in the system .",
    "for example , a uniform distribution of talent has a very different implication than say an exponential distribution .",
    "moreover , a significant potential dynamic that has not been studied in the context of the web is the death or deletion dynamic , which is dominant in most societal settings , where institutions and individuals cease to operate .",
    "the deletion dynamic , however , has been studied in the context of other networks @xcite , and a surprising",
    "finding is that the heavy - tailed degree distribution disappears in the straight pa model under significant deletion",
    ".    this prompted us to ask _ data - driven questions _",
    ", such as : how dominant is the churn or deletion dynamic in the web ? can a pa model with fitness preserve the heavy tail even in the presence of high deletion rates ?",
    "can one empirically verify that the proposed models are _ truly at work _ in the web ?",
    "can one empirically estimate the relative fitness of a significant number of pages on the web and quantify the distribution of talent on the web ?",
    "most interesting of all , how often can talents overtake the more experienced individuals and emerge as the _ winner _ ? such issues , while have been partially theorized about , have not been empirically studied and validated .",
    "+   + * brief summary of findings . * using web crawls that span the period of one year ( i.e. , 13 separate crawls , at one month interval ) , we tracked both the death and the growth processes of the web pages .",
    "in particular , we tracked 17.5 thousand web hosts , via monthly crawls , with each crawl containing in excess of 22 million pages ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "first , we discovered that there is a high turnover rate , and for every page created on the web , our conservative numerical estimates show that at least around @xmath7 pages are deleted ( see _ results _ and supporting information ) .",
    "this is a significant enough deletion rate that it prompted us to analyze a theoretical model that integrates the deletion process with the fitness - based preferential attachment dynamics ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "previous models of the web had neglected the death dynamic ; recent results , however , show that even a relatively low - grade deletion dynamic could alter network characteristics considerably .",
    "given the distribution of fitness , our model can predict the overall degree distribution and the degree distribution of nodes with similar age .    the empirical crawl data is then used to estimate the parameters of the model .",
    "this allows us to validate for the first time whether detailed time - domain data is consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model .",
    "one of the most important assumptions of the model is that each page can be assigned a constant fitness ( which can vary from page to page ) that determines the rate at which it will accumulate hyperlinks .",
    "we perform an estimation of the fitness factor for each month , and show that for the period of the crawls , the data do not reject the hypothesis that each page has a constant fitness ( see supporting information ) .",
    "a further verification of the model is obtained by validating one of its most direct implications . in particular",
    ", the dynamical model predicts that the accumulated in - degree ( i.e. , counting all hyperlinks , including those made by pages that get deleted during our study period ) of a page grows as a power - law .",
    "we find that for a vast majority of pages that show any growth , the degree - vs - time plots in the @xmath8-@xmath8 scale have linear fits with correlation coefficients in excess of @xmath9 ( see the _ results _ section ) .",
    "the slope of the linear fit is an affine function of the fitness of the page .",
    "the robust estimation of the fitness factors of individual pages allows us to determine the overall distribution .",
    "we find the fitness on the web to be exponentially distributed ( i.e. , see figure  [ fig : web_fit_log](a ) ) , with a truncation . when inserted into our analytical model , this _ exponential fitness distribution correctly predicts _ the power - law degree distribution empirically observed in the overall web as well as for the set of nodes with similar age . for pages with similar age ,",
    "the initial exponential distribution of fitness gets amplified by the pa mechanism , and as a result , the degree distribution of pages of the same age is a pl distribution with exponent @xmath10 , i.e. , with high variance .",
    "moreover , the truncated exponential distribution of fitness is one of the few distributions that would generate a constant pl exponent in the overall degree distribution , even as the turnover rate approaches unity ( i.e. , as many pages are deleted as created on the average ) .",
    "the empirical data agrees with this prediction and the pl degree distribution retains a constant low - magnitude exponent throughout the period of our study ( see the _ results _ section ) even though the deletion rate of pages remains high .",
    "thus the fitness distribution of the pages helps in preserving the heavy - tailed scale - free overall degree distribution of the web .",
    "the sequential time - sampled data helps us in better understanding the interplay between experience and talent ( fitness ) .",
    "for example , the _ initial in - degree of a page _",
    "( i.e. , in june 2006 ) is a measure of its _ experience _ , and _ the accumulated final in - degree _",
    "( i.e. , in june 2007 ) is a measure of _ how it fared _ based on its fitness and its experience .",
    "we _ define a page to be a winner _ if its final degree exceeds a specific desired target , while starting with an initial degree less than the target value .",
    "figure  [ fig : sep ] ( a ) shows the _ initial in - degree distribution _ of all pages such that the initial degree was less than 1000 and the accumulated final degree greater than 1000 .",
    "the case of different target final degree values is discussed in supporting information .",
    "if the growth of the number of hyperlinks acquired by a page was based purely on pa ( i.e. , all pages have the same talent / fitness ) , then only pages with initial degree greater than a certain threshold would end up with final degree greater than a thousand .",
    "clearly , the empirical data shows that it is not the case : there are _ talented winners _ who have very low initial in - degree and yet end up as winners ; similarly , there are _ experienced losers _ who start with a large in - degree ( i.e. , greater than the cut - off ) but yet end up with cumulative in - degree less that 1k .",
    "figure  [ fig : sep ] ( b ) shows the number of talented winners and experienced losers as a function of the cut - off , and for the sake of fair comparison , we pick a value for the cutoff such that the number of talented winners equals the number of experienced losers .",
    "thus , we find that for this sample set , _ the web collectively picked @xmath11 talented winners _ , and displaced an equal number of more experienced pages , thus striking a balance between talent and experience . as analyzed in supporting information , the percentage of talented winners seems to remain relatively constant as the target degree is varied .    what does the fitness distribution look like for pages with similar experience ?",
    "figure  [ fig : web_fit_log ] ( b ) shows the fitness distributions of pages with similar initial in - degree , and hence , similar experience .",
    "they all are exponentially distributed , except that the average fitness is a function of the initial degrees of the nodes .",
    "figure  [ fig : avgfitvsdeg ] shows the average fitness as a function of initial in - degree .",
    "it shows that the average fitness is largest for nodes with least experience , and decreases as a pl until about an in - degree value of 100 ; it levels off after that .",
    "thus the web , seems to give a preferential treatment ( even though , only exponentially rarely ) to pages with low record / experience , and then treats them the same statistically once they are beyond a threshold .",
    "thus , the web encourages pages with low or little experience just a bit more than the mature pages ; but for any group , it judges talent quite conservatively keeping the distribution exponential . ;",
    "thus always allowing a few new comers to break in .",
    "the macroscopic structure of the web is , thus , being guided by a tension between experience / entitlement and talent / potential .",
    "the concept of fitness has implications on how we rank the importance and attractiveness of web pages . in the _ discussion _ section",
    ", we propose that one can use the fitness estimates of the pages to boost their rankings ; this way , pages with low overall degree but that are growing fast will get higher ranking .",
    "* estimating the fitness of webpages : talents are exponentially rare . *",
    "if the fitness with deletions model is indeed applicable to the web , the accumulated degree of each node should follow eq .",
    "[ k_accum ] as discussed in _ materials and methods_. in particular , from eq .",
    "[ k_accum ] , taking the logarithm of both sides of the accumulated degree of a page , we get : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is some time - invariant offset . hence , the slope of the linear fit of the logarithm of the accumulated degree @xmath14 and time @xmath15 gives node @xmath3 s growth exponent @xmath16 .",
    "note that the fitness value is related to the growth exponent of a node by a linear transformation with constant coefficients ( see eq .",
    "[ beta ] ) .",
    "thus , the distribution characteristics of fitness can be obtained by measuring the growth exponent of each node . the methodology for measuring the distribution of the growth exponents",
    "is described as follows : first , we identify about 10 million webpages that persist through all 13 months from june 2006 to june 2007 .",
    "for each of these webpages , the set of in - neighbors are identified for all months .",
    "the accumulated in - degree of a node at any month is the sum of the in - neighbors up to that particular month . in accordance with eq .",
    "[ eq : k_evol_accum ] , after taking the logarithm of the accumulated in - degree and time ( measured in months ) , the slope of the linear ordinary least - square fit ( i.e. the empirical growth exponent ) along with the pearson correlation coefficient are obtained for each webpage .",
    "we will refer to this methodology as the growth method ; in the supporting information , we present an alternative methodology , the direct kernel method , to estimate the fitness of webpages ; the results from the alternative method is consistent with the results from the growth method .",
    "we found that a large fraction of webpages do not gain any in - connection at all during the entire 1-year period .",
    "we consider a webpage to have a _",
    "zero _ growth exponent if its in - degree values increases two times or less during the 13 months .",
    "we found that only 6.5% of the webpages have _ nonzero _ growth exponents .",
    "we will focus our study on the set of nodes with nonzero growth exponents .",
    "note that the set of webpages with zero growth exponents essentially introduces a delta function at the origin in a fitness distribution plot .",
    "it is simple to check that the delta function does not impact the derivation of results and hence omitted from discussion for simplicity .",
    "an overwhelming fraction of the linear fit produces a correlation coefficient of 0.8 or more , with an average correlation value of 0.89 ( see supporting information ) .",
    "thus , our empirical measurement is consistent with the model that the evolution of node in - degree as a function of time follows a power - law as described in eq .",
    "[ eq : k_evol_accum ] for majority of the webpages .",
    "we plot the distribution of the growth exponents for the set of nodes with correlation coefficient of 0.8 or more in fig .",
    "[ fig : web_fit_log ] .",
    "the distribution of the growth exponents has a mean of 0.30 and clearly follows an exponential curve with a truncation around @xmath17 and a slope of @xmath18 in the log - linear plot ( i.e. a characteristic parameter of @xmath19 ) . since node fitness and the growth exponent are related by a linear transformation involving the constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22 , the fitness distribution is also well modeled by the same form of a truncated exponential .",
    "+   + * examples of high - talent webpages . *",
    "we now conduct checks to see if the webpages identified to have a large growth exponent indeed contain interesting or important content that warrants the title of being highly fit or `` talented '' .",
    "we manually inspected the several highest - fitness pages in our dataset .",

    "many in - links to this page is from other sites on nature and outdoor activities .",
    "another example is the webpage that reports the crime rate of the us from 1960 to 2006 ( http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm ) .",
    "this url has many in - links from other sites that discuss different crimes such as murder .",
    "+   + * power law degree distribution of the webpages with the same age .",
    "* for scientific citation networks , it is known that the in - degree distribution of the papers published in the same year follows a power law ( see the isi dataset in fig .",
    "1(a ) in @xcite ) .",
    "however , no parallel study has been performed for the web .",
    "using our temporal web dataset , we studied the in - degree distribution of the set of webpages with the same age .",
    "the in - degree distribution is found to follow a power law with an exponent of @xmath17 for over three decades ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : same_age ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the empirical finding by adamic and huberman that the degree distribution of web hosts with the same age has a large variance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the power law nature of the in - degree distribution is consistent with our theoretical prediction from eq .",
    "[ eq : degdist_sameage ] given the fitness distribution is found to be a truncated exponential ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "in contrast , a network dynamic model that does _ not _ account for fitness has a small variance for the nodes with the same age , which leads to the effect that the `` rich '' node must be the old node .",
    "in fact , this is the basis of the issue raised by adamic and huberman @xcite .",
    "thus , _ the fitness - based model naturally generates the power law degree distribution for the set of nodes with the same age _ , which is not explained by other existing models that do not account for fitness such as @xcite .",

    "we now discuss the webpage removal process as observed in our dataset . in our analytical model , a node",
    "is removed uniformly randomly ( i.e. independent of node degree ) .",
    "we found empirical evidence to support the uniform random removal assumption : we observed that the degree distribution of the set of removed nodes that disappear in a given month is similar to the degree distribution of all nodes ( see supporting information ) .",
    "recall that the turnover rate is defined as the average number of nodes removed per node added . from our dataset , the turnover rate is measured to be @xmath23 ( i.e. for every new webpage inserted , 0.91 webpage is removed per unit time ) .",
    "however , this figure is an overestimate of the true turnover rate on the web , since we are examining a fixed set of web hosts .",
    "therefore , we also need to account for the growth in the number of web hosts .",
    "nevertheless , even after accounting for the source of growth from the insertion of web hosts , web still has a minimum turnover rate of 77% ( see supporting information ) .    despite the high rate of node turnovers",
    ", the power law degree distribution is found to be very stable ( see fig . [",
    "fig : gamma_month ] ) .",
    "this finding is consistent with our ad hoc fitness model prediction that the power law exponent @xmath2 of the degree distribution @xmath24 stays constant for varying rates of node deletion for a truncated exponential fitness distribution ( see eq .",
    "[ gammais2 ] in _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "the resilience of the power law exponent is in stark contrast to the result obtained for the pa - with - deletion model ( without any fitness variance ) , where the power law exponent is found to diverge rapidly as @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "thus , _ the natural variation of node fitness provides a self - stabilization force for the power law exponent of the degree distribution under high rate of node turnovers_. +   + * talented winners versus experienced losers . * in the _ introduction _ , we proposed the idea of talented winners and experienced losers and how they are identified in our empirical web dataset for a given target degree @xmath26 .",
    "for the particular case of @xmath27 , we find that 48% of the winners are talented winners ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sep ] ) , who successfully displaced the experienced losers ( i.e. the nodes with higher initial in - degrees but fail to become a winner ) .",
    "this observation is seemingly paradoxical : how can talents emerge to win close to half of the times when talents are exponentially rare ?",
    "we seek to understand the interplay between experience and talent through analytical modeling .",
    "consider a node with the initial degree @xmath28 in month @xmath29 ( i.e. june , 2006 , the start of our observation period ) . in order for the node to achieve @xmath26 in month @xmath30 ( i.e. june , 2007 , the end of our observation period ) ,",
    "the growth exponent of the node must exceed the critical value : @xmath31 .",

    "while our data is statistically consistent with the model assumption of a constant fitness for each page , our observation period is over a relatively short period of one year . for longer periods",
    ", one would expect the fitness of a page to change .",
    "for example , occasionally , a page that has been lying dormant for a while might find its content become topical and , hence , its fitness suddenly increases , allowing it to start accumulating links and becoming popular .",

    "the findings in this paper present an alternative perspective on this problem and show that talents , while being exponentially rare , are frequently afforded the opportunity to overtake more `` entrenched '' web pages and emerge as the winner .",
    "currently , for any given query , pages are ranked based on a number of metrics , including the relevancy score of the query keywords in a document , and the document s pagerank , which is computed based on the in - degree ( or experience ) of the page and the hyperlink structure of the web at the time of the crawl . in order to avoid the entitlement bias potentially introduced due to pagerank",
    ", a number of researchers have advocated that one should also boost low pagerank pages , for example , by randomly introducing them among the top pages @xcite .",
    "the fitness of a page could be added as another metric that could influence the ranking .",
    "the determination of the exact functional form of how the fitness , @xmath6 , of a page would influence its rank would require considerable experimentation and editorial evaluations , but a promising start would be to multiply the currently computed ranks by @xmath47 , where the exponent @xmath48 is tuned based on quality assessment and testing .",

    "<S> we use sequential large - scale crawl data to empirically investigate and validate the dynamics that underlie the evolution of the structure of the web . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the overall structure of the web is defined by an intricate interplay between experience or entitlement of the pages ( as measured by the number of inbound hyperlinks a page already has ) , inherent talent or fitness of the pages ( as measured by the likelihood that someone visiting the page would give a hyperlink to it ) , and the continual high rates of birth and death of pages on the web . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the web is conservative in judging talent , and the overall fitness distribution is exponential , showing low variability . </S>",
    "<S> the small variance in talent , however , is enough to lead to experience distributions with high variance : the preferential attachment mechanism amplifies these small biases and leads to heavy - tailed power - law ( pl ) inbound degree distributions over all pages , as well as , over pages that are of the same age . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential distribution of fitness is also key in countering the potentially destabilizing effect of removal of pages : it stabilizes the exponent of the pl to a low value , and preserves the heavy tail and the resulting hierarchy , even in the face of very high rates of uniform deletion of web pages . </S>",
    "<S> the balancing act between experience and talent on the web allows newly introduced pages with novel and interesting content to grow fast and catch up or even surpass older pages who have already built their web presence . in this regard , it is much like what we observe in high - mobility and meritocratic societies : people with entitlement continue to have access to the best resources , but there is just enough screening for fitness that allows for talented winners to emerge and join the ranks of the leaders . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the estimates of the fitness of webpages and their distribution have potential practical applications in ranking search engine query results , which can allow users easier access to promising web pages that have not yet become popular . </S>"
