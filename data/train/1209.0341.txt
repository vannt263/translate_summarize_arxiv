    "the steady - state infection of the network presents two different regimes depending on the virulence of the infection and the structure of the network of contacts . in one of the regimes ,",
    "an initial infection dies out at a fast ( usually exponential ) rate . in the other regime ,",
    "an initial infection becomes an epidemic .",
    "both numerical and analytical results show that these two regimes are separated by a phase transition at an epidemic threshold determined by both the virulence of the infection and the topology of the network .",
    "one of the most fundamental questions in mathematical epidemiology is to find the value of the epidemic threshold in terms of the virus model and the contact network .    in many cases of practical interest",
    "it is unfeasible to exactly retrieve the complete structure of a network of contacts . in these cases , it is impossible to exactly compute the epidemic threshold . on the other hand , in most cases one can easily retrieve the structure of egocentric views of the network , also called _ _",

    ", researchers have proposed a variety of random network models in which they can prescribe structural properties that can be retrieved from these egonets , such as the degree distribution nsw01,clv03 , local correlations @xcite , or clustering new09 .",
    "although random networks are the primary tool to study the impact of local structural features on the epidemic threshold @xcite , this approach presents a major flaw : random network models implicitly induce many structural properties that are not directly controlled but can have a strong influence on the value of the epidemic threshold .",
    "for example , it is possible to find two networks having the same degree distribution , but with opposite dynamical behavior _ _  _ _ @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is difficult ( if not impossible ) to isolate the role of a particular structural property in the network performance using random network models .",
    "furthermore , many real networks present weighted edges representing , for example , bandwidth in communication networks or resistance in electric networks .",
    "current random networks fail to faithfully recover both the structure of the network and the distribution of weights over the links . in this paper",

    "a wide variety of stochastic models has been proposed in the literature to study the dynamics of virus spreading processes . in most models ,",
    "the steady - state level of infection in the network presents two different regimes separated by a phase transition taking place at an epidemic threshold .",
    "this epidemic threshold is determined by both the virulence of the infection and the network topology .",
    "a series of papers study the value of this epidemic threshold as a function of the network structure , in both random @xcite@xcite and real topologies @xcite  pcfvf11 .",
    "a spreading model widely considered in the literature is the so - called sis ( susceptible - infected - susceptible ) model . in this model ,",
    "each individual in the network can be in one of two possible states : _ susceptible _ or _",
    "infected_. given an initial set of infected individuals , the virus propagates through the edges of an undirected graph @xmath18 at an infection rate @xmath40 .",
    "simultaneously , infected nodes recover at a rate @xmath41 , returning back to the susceptible state ( see @xcite for a formal description of this model ) . in @xcite",
    " mok09 , we find different ( and complementary ) approaches to find an expression for the sis epidemic threshold . in all of these papers ,",
    "the authors are able to decouple the effect of the network topology from the dynamics of individual nodes . on the one hand ,",
    "the effect of the node dynamics is completely characterized by the ratio @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of the network topology depends _ exclusively _ on the largest eigenvalue of the network adjacency matrix , @xmath43 , such that if the threshold condition @xmath44 is satisfied , a ` small ' initial infection dies out exponentially fast @xcite@xcite .",
    "many extensions to the sis model have been proposed to capture different characteristics of viral processes , such as permanent or temporal immunity of a recovered individual , or virus incubation time @xcite . as shown in @xcite , the decoupling argument that allows to separate the role of the network topology from the node dynamics in the sis model still holds for a variety of other virus models .",
    "similarly , a ` small ' initial infection dies out exponentially fast in these models if the condition @xmath45 is satisfied , where the threshold @xmath46 measures the virulence of the infection ( and is independent of the network structure ) . as a bottom line ,",
    "all of the above results remark the key role played by the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix , @xmath43 , in virus spreading processes .",
    "in particular , the larger @xmath43 , the more efficient a network is to spread a disease ( or a piece of information ) virally .",
    "random network models are currently the primary tool to study the relationship between local structural properties of a network and its epidemic threshold .",
    "although many random networks have been proposed in the literature @xcite@xcite , only random networks including a very limited amount of structural information are currently amenable to analysis .",

    "are by far not enough to faithfully model the structure of real complex networks .",
    "in particular , it is well - known that the degree distribution alone is not a sufficient statistic to analyze the performance of many networks .",
    "for example , alderson et al . introduce in @xcite a collection of networks , including random graphs , presenting the same degree distribution and radically different dynamical performance .",
    "although random graph models with more elaborated structural properties can be found in the literature @xcite@xcite , these models are usually hard ( if not impossible ) to analyze from a spectral point of view .",
    "the source of this intractability is the presence of strong correlations among the entries of the ( random ) adjacency matrix .",
    "these strong correlations prevent the resulting random adjacency matrix from being analytically tractable . in the next section",
    ", we present a novel approach to analyze the effect of local structural properties on the largest eigenvalue of a network without making use of random graphs .",
    "in this section , we study the relationship between local structural properties of a network and its eigenvalue spectrum . in our analysis",

    "a fundamental question in the field of mathematical epidemiology is to understand the relationship between a network s structural properties and its epidemic threshold . for many virus epidemic models ,",
    "the role of the network topology is characterized by the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix , such that the larger the eigenvalue , the more efficient a network is to spread a disease ( or a piece of information ) virally . in many cases of practical interest ,",
    "it is not possible to retrieve the complete structure of a network of contacts due to privacy and/or security constrains .",
    "thus , it is not possible to exactly compute the largest eigenvalue of the network . on the other hand , it is usually easy to retrieve local views of a network , also called egonets , by extracting the structure of neighborhoods around a collection of chosen nodes . to estimate the value of the spectral radius",
    "when only egonets are available , researchers usually use random network models in which they prescribe local structural features that can be extracted from the egonets , such as the degree distribution .",
    "this approach , although very common in practice , presents a major flaw : random network models implicitly induce many structural properties that are not directly controlled and can be relevant to the spreading dynamics .    in this paper , we have presented an alternative mathematical framework , based on algebraic graph theory and convex optimization , to study how egonets constrain the interval of possible values in which the largest eigenvalue ( and , therefore , the epidemic threshold ) must lie .",

    "this is in contrast with estimators based on random networks , which can be very misleading and present no quality guarantees .",
    "our numerical simulations have shown that the resulting interval in which the largest eigenvalue must lie is very narrow for several social and communication networks .",
