    "our understanding of the association of physical means of handling information with thermodynamic entropy has evolved due to the seminal work of landauer @xcite .",
    "this work led to the understanding that the entropy produced by generating randomness in some type of physically stored data must be taken into consideration when calculating the change in the total entropy associated with the functioning of the system .",
    "recently , mandal _",
    "_  have demonstrated the possibility of a refrigerator running on information@xcite .",
    "the system extracts heat from a low temperature source and places it at a higher temperature , without utilizing any mechanical energy input .",
    "second law is still satisfied as entropy is produced by irreversibly modifying the contents of a `` tape '' which is used as a medium to process information associated with the state of the system .",
    "the authors allude to the maxwell demon for obvious reasons .    in this present work ,",
    "we study the collective behavior of a number of `` machines '' which run on information .",
    "the inter - dependency of the machines is due to a configuration in which the information output of some machines are fed to other machines lower in a hierarchy of information access .",
    "machines in the highest level of hierarchy have access to a periodic supply of low - entropy information . machines at lower levels of hierarchy have to function with lower efficiency due to the deteriorated information supply .",
    "the model has some features associated with driven diffusive systems , especially with asep systems@xcite , in terms of its dynamics .",
    "although multilane versions of such systems have been studied@xcite , the emphasis has been on availability of multiple channels for transport , rather than a competition between them .    even though it is tempting to associate some particulars of this study with social structures and their operations , the model obviously is too simplistic even for real physical problems .",
    "figure [ machines ] gives a brief description of the refrigerator proposed by mandal _",
    "et al._@xcite and the machine which is used as a building block of various system configurations studied in this work .    note that in both machines , transitions may influence a status bit , which is set to a new value periodically , with period @xmath0 .",
    "( see references @xcite . )",
    "the periodic updating of the status bit should be interpreted as setting the machine status to an `` input '' bit , while the previous status is released as `` output '' .",
    "( a `` tape '' structure is envisioned which contains these input and output bits . )",
    "best machine performance will be obtained if this new value is always equal to zero , corresponding to a low entropy .",

    "the machines reside in one of the states denoted by black circles .",
    "information is accessible as a `` tape '' ( or a `` status '' in ( b ) ) bit which is ( optimally ) refreshed periodically to value zero ( the dotted arrows ) .",
    "otherwise , the system may make transitions between two energy levels @xmath1 apart , under the effect of heat baths with temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "( a single heat bath at temperature @xmath4 is present at ( b ) . ) with proper choice of parameters , on the average , heat is taken from the low temperature ( @xmath3 ) bath and deposited to the bath at the higher temperature @xmath2 by the machine at ( a ) . the machine at ( b )",

    "note that we now allow the possibility that the energy state of the machine may go down a step within time @xmath0 , as its status may be set to one by the input stream .",

    "we then have the following probabilities just before the next periodic status update : @xmath20 @xmath21    the rate at which energy is extracted from the heat bath will be @xmath22 with @xmath23 the expectation value of the change in the energy ladder step : @xmath24 .",
    "note that in order for this quantity to be positive , one needs to have @xmath25 .",

    "the string of zeros and ones released by the machine then has a @xmath33 closer to @xmath34 in comparison to the input string . on the other hand , for @xmath31 mechanical work",
    "is converted to heat , but the entropy of the output string is reduced with a higher probability of zeros .",
    "the machine then acts as an `` eraser '' .",
    "figure [ p_star ] shows the variation of @xmath34 as a function of temperature .",

    "if a second machine is using the output of the first machine as its input , the corresponding parameter for the work takes a very simple form : @xmath38 .",

    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 variables denote the status bits which remain unchanged.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a model is now proposed in which the structure in figure [ machines]b is repeated in neighboring columns .",
    "machines are allowed to climb up ( or down ) each column , height along the column being associated with the energy state of the machine .",
    "( we will allow more than one machine to operate on a column . )",
    "different status bits are associated with each position of the thus formed lattice .",
    "( initially all status bits are set to one . ) a description of the dynamics of a machine along a column is given in figure [ column ] . machines may modify the status bits of the sites they move into : a machine with status zero may move up in the lattice , only if the new site is unoccupied and has status zero . the status of the new site will then be modified as one .",
    "restrictions for going down in energy is the reverse : machine must start from a site with status one , and may land in a new ( unoccupied ) site with status 0 .",
    "the status of the original site is returned to zero . at refresh times all status bits",
    "are shifted one column to the column on the right .",
    "fresh status bits ( all zeros ) are fed from the left to all positions of the leftmost column .",
    "this structure then puts the machines in the leftmost column in a more advantageous position : they can only move up in energy , possibly being restricted by the presence of other machines in the same column .",
    "this type of motion is a type of tasep ( totally asymmetric simple exclusion process@xcite ) , with a somewhat complicated jump rate .",
    "the status bits drifting towards the right at periodic refresh intervals provide columns to the right with lower and lower `` quality '' status bits to work with .",
    "we study two types of models : in both of them there are 40 columns . in the first model , we consider a semi - infinite lattice in the energy direction , with a lower bound `` ground state '' energy .",
    "we start with a completely unoccupied lattice , with an entry rate of @xmath41 into the lowest energy state if it is unoccupied and has status zero .",
    "( this again provides a hierarchical advantage to columns that are closer to the left boundary . ) note that this system will not reach a steady state , and we report the statistical results of a finite time ( albeit unfair ) `` race '' among the columns .    in the second model",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions in the energy direction .",
    "( step - wise motion in such non - conservative force fields has been very eloquently studied by escher@xcite . ) here , we produce steady state results which indicate that although this race on a ring is still unfair , disadvantaged machines tend to align themselves at positions where they avoid the partially depleted outputs of machines to their left , and use the the remnants of the fresh status bits that were untouched .",
    "the models described above using a kinetic monte carlo procedure@xcite .",
    "the values reported in this section typically involve the average of 100 independent runs for the semi - infinite system and @xmath42 monte carlo steps for the ring systems .",
    "( one monte carlo step is defined as the period in which all objects in the system move once on the average . )",
    "the first column of the first model ( on a semi - infinite lattice ) is a tasep system , as mentioned before .",
    "although the infinite size of the lattice does not allow a steady state to be reached through a simulation , the current and density near the entry point ( the ground state ) should reach a steady state .",
    "a direct comparison with known results for this model is not available , due to the complications introduced to the transition rates through the periodic status update .",
    "nevertheless , one would expect to see the phase transition ( apparent due to the discontinuities in the second derivatives of density and current as a function of entry rate ) near a value of the entry rate which produces a density @xmath43 .",
    "studies on finite size tasep systems with open boundaries yield a `` bulk '' density which changes as a function of @xmath41 until a critical value is reached ( @xmath44 for the simple system in @xcite ) . for values of @xmath45",
    "the bulk density stays fixed at 0.5 .",
    "( actually , in this regime , the `` bulk '' region is formed by a linear change in density , averaging to the value 0.5 , between the entry and exit boundary regions . )",
    "density profile along the first column , for various values of the entry rate @xmath41 .",
    "the inset shows the detail near the entry boundary .",
    "note that apart from a small boundary region , the density profile becomes undiscernable for @xmath46.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ dens_plot ] shows the density profile along the first column , for various values of the entry rate @xmath41 .",
    "the density of machines away from the entry boundary seem to have a universal profile , independent of the value of @xmath41 .",
    "this profile is formed by the pioneer machines which are `` filling up '' empty space in front of them .",
    "the density behind this front depends on the value of @xmath41 : for values of @xmath41 greater than about 0.35 , the density front reaches very near the entry boundary . for smaller values of @xmath41 ,",
    "the density profile reaches the entry boundary with a value which depends on @xmath41 , with no appreciable boundary effect .",

    "the inset is a plot of @xmath49 to display the power law behavior .",
    "the plots are for @xmath50 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 and 0.35 .",
    "note that curves for @xmath51 are undiscernable.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the current along the columns is a measure of of the rate at which energy is being absorbed from the heat bath .",
    "that in turn is related to the supply of low entropy status bits to the machines .",
    "the total current at the entry boundary , corresponding to the energy production rate of machines on 40 columns ( each feeding on the remnants of the entropy resource left from the previous column ) , adds up to what is available at the leftmost column .",
    "indeed , we find that the total entry rate of machines to the system is independent of the value of @xmath41 .",
    "how that resource utilization rate is distributed among the columns does of course depend on @xmath41 , and is shown in figure [ util_plot ] .",
    "note that smaller values of the entry rate correspond to more a equitable ( among the hierarchies ) distribution for the utilization of the low entropy resource .",
