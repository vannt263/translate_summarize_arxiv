    "one of the main challenges in a quantum mechanical experiment is to overcome the interaction of a system with its environment .",
    "such interactions lead to _ decoherence _ and often obscure coherent quantum phenomena .",
    "recently it has been shown that this vice can be turned into a virtue : dissipative processes can be exploited as a possible resource for quantum state engineering  @xcite .",
    "several evolutions leading to non - trivial fixed points have now been proposed , including states with non - trivial topological properties  @xcite . such _ dissipative engineering _ has opened up a completely new world for us .",
    "motivated by the new possibilities offered by dissipative engineering there has been renewed interest in understanding dissipative processes in more detail .",
    "however , this task is complicated by the fact that , as for ground states , we can only hope for analytic solutions in very special cases .",
    "therefore , in general , we must take recourse to numerical approximation techniques in order to gain insight into the physics of a dissipative system .",
    "typically the method of choice here is a _",
    "monte carlo _ sampling algorithm .",
    "such methods have led to many insights into the dissipative systems occurring in quantum optics , but have faced limitations when applied to strongly interacting many particle systems , particularly fermions , due to the inevitable _ sign problem_.    there is , however , another general approach available to us , namely the _ variational method_. this method has been very successfully applied in the pure - state case leading to unparalleled insights into the equilibrium physics of strongly interacting many body systems .",
    "further , the elegant _ time - dependent variational principle _ ( tdvp )  @xcite allows the _ locally optimal _ study of nonequilibrium _ unitary _ dynamics .",
    "the power of this method is well known in the field of quantum chemistry , where its application to the class of hartree - fock states is known as _ time - dependent hartree fock theory _  @xcite .",
    "this technique has also been exploited to great effect in the context of one - dimensional quantum spin systems in conjunction with powerful expressive variational classes such as matrix product states , a method synonymous with the _ density matrix renormalisation group _ ( dmrg )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the pure - state case , there is no operationally unique way to formulate the variational method for mixed states because there is no distinguished measure of information distance : there are infinite families of inequivalent distance measures , including examples such as the _ fidelity _ and the _ trace distance_. this has complicated the formulation of a mixed - state tdvp , which requires knowledge of the _ geometry _ of state space .",
    "however , recent results in our understanding of the information geometry of mixed states allow us to revisit this problem .",
    "( see , however ,  @xcite for related variational approaches to the von neumann equation . )    thus , in this article , we formulate the tdvp for mixed states in the general case of distance measures arising from _ monotone riemannian metrics_. we then show that this method , when applied to the variational class of fermionic gaussian states evolving according to an arbitrary markovian cpt ( completely positive trace - preserving ) map @xmath0 are all equivalent to the application of wick s theorem ( via _ gaussification _ ) .",
    "finally , we apply this method to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spinful hubbard model subject to a decoherence process .",
    "in this section we review of the tdvp for pure quantum states , and explain why this approach can not be immediately applied to the mixed case .",
    "first , we present the necessary notation .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the set of all complex @xmath2 matrices with entries in @xmath3 .",
    "the state space of an @xmath4-dimensional quantum system is given by the set @xmath5 ( here viewed as a differentiable manifold ) of all density operators defined by @xmath6 . in order to formulate a time - evolution within this manifold",
    ", we have to introduce the notion of tangent space .",
    "the tangent space @xmath7 to @xmath5 at any interior point @xmath8 can be identified with the set @xmath9 of traceless hermitian matrices ( we assume that our processes never include any part of the boundary of the manifold ) . the set @xmath5 can be given the structure of a riemannian manifold by choosing a positive bilinear form @xmath10 on @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "this supplements us with the notion of a distance . throughout",
    "we define a _ variational class _ to be a submanifold @xmath11 of @xmath5 parametrized according to @xmath12 , where the dependence on the parameters @xmath13 is assumed to be analytic .",
    "we consider the time evolution of a quantum state @xmath14 in its most general form , i.e.  @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a completely positive trace - preserving ( cpt ) map .",
    "assuming that @xmath16 is differentiable with respect to @xmath17 allows us to write the equation of motion as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the infinitesimal generator of the dynamics .",
    "for example , @xmath19 could describe a hamiltonian or dissipative evolution of a quantum system .",
    "an exact solution to this evolution is in general hard to find , and so we aim at finding an optimal approximation to this evolution within the variational class @xmath11 .    to this end , we first review the case of hamiltonian time evolution within the set of pure quantum states . here",
    ", the variational class of state vectors is represented as the set @xmath20 .",
    "the time - dependent schroedinger equation then reads @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "note that , in general , the vector @xmath23 is not an element of the tangent space to @xmath11 at @xmath24 , whereas the left side is a linear combination of vectors that span the tangent space @xmath25 .",
    "thus , in general , there is no exact solution for @xmath26 .",
    "the best approximation is given by the solution to the minimisation of the _ information distance _",
    "( here measured using the _ fidelity _ ) between the left- and right - hand sides : @xmath27 . the minimum can be found by applying an orthogonal projection of @xmath28 onto the tangent space , as depicted in fig.[fig : tdvp ] .    .",
    "a mixed quantum state @xmath29 within a variational manifold @xmath11 evolves in time according to an arbitrary physical process described by a cpt map @xmath30 . in general , such a process leads out of the tangent space of the variational manifold at the point @xmath29 .",
    "hence , we have to `` project back '' into @xmath11 using an appropriate measure of distance ( color online ) .",
    "[ fig : tdvp ] ]    this discussion immediately reveals why the tdvp can not be directly applied to the mixed - state setting : the approximation of the rhs of @xmath31 by a vector in the tangent space requires a unique notion of information distance . in the mixed - state case",
    "there is no operationally unique answer , since there exist infinite families of inequivalent measures , and hence , there is no canonical choice of riemannian metric on @xmath5 .",
    "however , we explain in the next section a possible solution to this problem .",
    "as we have explained above , there exists no canonical choice of riemannian metrics in on the set of mixed quantum states .",
    "however , it turns out that there are several _ families _ of riemannian metrics which naturally arise from information - theoretic considerations . here",
    "the natural condition is that the metric is _",
    "monotone _ , meaning that the norm induced by the bilinear form @xmath32 can not increase under any cpt - map @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "the reasoning here is that the distinguishability of two states infinitesimally close to @xmath35 can never be increased under the action of a channel .",
    "remarkably , petz showed there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of monotone metrics and a special class of _ superoperators _ @xmath36 ( built in terms of convex operator functions ) @xcite : these lead to monotone metrics according to @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "these monotone metrics now allow an operationally motivated formulation of the tdvp for the dissipative dynamics generated by @xmath38 within a given variational class @xmath11 .",
    "the setup is identical to the pure - state case : we aim to find the optimal trajectory @xmath39 generated by the vector field coming from the optimal element @xmath40 which is closest to @xmath41 , where we use the quadratic form @xmath42 to measure the distance .",
    "that is , we solve @xmath43 .",
    "an intuitive picture of this last equation is given in fig .  [",
    "fig : tdvp ] : the evolution under @xmath33 takes us out of the variational manifold @xmath11 , and we want to  project back  into @xmath11 to find the state in the variational manifold that is the best approximation to this evolution . using the definition of @xmath44 we find that this is equivalent to solving @xmath45 parametrizing @xmath46 we can rewrite this infimum as @xmath47 .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the _ pullback metric _ or _",
    "gram matrix_. this solution gives us the optimal trajectory ( locally in time ) within @xmath11 via integration of the equation of motion @xmath50 this equation of motion is the first main contribution of our article .",
    "( 2)(5 ) can be applied to any variational manifold subject to any physical process . in the next section",
    "we apply this framework to a concrete example that is relevant in many - body physics .",
    "the understanding of fermionic quantum systems is of central interest many fields of physics .",
    "fermions are building blocks of matter and thus central to some of the most fascinating effects known in the theory of many - body physics , like superconductivity or the quantum hall effect . however , most problems of interest do not have a closed analytic solution , and we have to use numerical approximation techniques and we have to use appropriate variational wave functions to obtain insight into these systems . in the following we introduce the class of _ fermionic gaussian states _ ( fgs ) that has been successfully applied to solve fermionic many - body problems in the pure state setting .",
    "we show then how the tdvp can be applied using this class of states as our variational class @xmath51 and give a numerical example in the last section .    in the following",
    "we describe fermionic systems in terms of @xmath52 fermionic mode operators @xmath53 obeying the canonical anti - commutation relations @xmath54 .",
    "we use the equivalent representation in terms of @xmath55 hermitian _ majorana _ operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 which obey @xmath58 .",
    "we take as our variational manifold the set of _ fermionic gaussian states _ ( fgs ) .",
    "fgs are those states whose density operator can be expressed as an exponential of a quadratic function of the majorana operators , @xmath59 $ ] , where @xmath60 .",
    "all information about the state is encoded in the real and anti - symmetric covariance matrix ( cm ) , @xmath61\\rho)$ ] , due to wick s theorem : @xmath62 = \\mbox{pf}(\\gamma_{j_1 , \\ldots , j_{2p}})$ ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the corresponding @xmath65 submatrix of @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is called the pfaffian ( see , e.g. , @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the class of fgs is a natural generalization of the variational classes used in hartree - fock and bcs - theory .",
    "thus , it is combining and extending the most successful tools in the description of fermionic many - body systems and hence allows for a description of a wide class of fermionic phases of matter , like superfluids , mott and spin ordered phases .",
    "recently it has also been shown that fgs with topological order can be engineered in a cold - atom implementation via a local dissipative process  @xcite .",
    "thus , fgs have proven to be a powerful class capable of capturing fermionic phases with highly non - trivial properties .",
    "every pure fgs is the ground state of a quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "further , fgs remain gaussian under the evolution according to a quadratic hamiltonian or a dissipative process with linear lindblad operators . using this ,",
    "fgs have allowed the approximation of the ground and thermal states of , the time - evolution  @xcite of , as well as the excitation spectra  @xcite of interacting fermionic systems .",
    "the main ingredient used in all studies exploiting fgs is a process known as _ gaussification _ ,",
    "i.e. , the approximation of any @xmath52-body correlation function in terms of a product of single - particle correlation functions via wick s theorem ( see above ) :    let @xmath68 be a fermionic quantum state",
    ". then its _ gaussification _ , @xmath69 ,",
    "is defined via the relation @xmath70 , which is equivalent to the application of wick s theorem to @xmath68 .    in the following ,",
    "we show that the process of gaussification is locally optimal in time within the variational class of fgs for all @xmath71 metrics , since every monotone metric can be written as a convex combination of them  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be an arbitrary ( differentiable ) markovian cpt map defining a time evolution on the space of density matrices via @xmath0 .",
    "then , the optimal approximation of this time evolution within the variational manifold of gaussian states @xmath51 with respect to any ( convex combination of ) monotone metrics of _ @xmath71-norm type _ :",
    "@xmath72 is obtained via gaussification .",
    "theorem 1 is the second main result of this article . to prove it we obtain a gaussification of the time evolution of @xmath35 according to the generator @xmath19 of the cpt map @xmath16 as follows",
    "let @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an infinitesimal time step .",
    "the operator @xmath75 is not necessarily a member of the tangent space @xmath76 .",
    "however , the gaussified operator @xmath77 is , and it is therefore a linear combination of the tangent vectors @xmath78 , i.e.   @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "since , by definition , gaussification implies @xmath81 , we obtain from the linearity of the map @xmath66 , the following defining condition for the expansion parameters @xmath82 : @xmath83 = \\sum_jv^j { \\mbox{tr}}[c_{k_1 } c_{k_2 } \\partial_j \\rho].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we show that an application of the tdvp projection with respect to any @xmath71-norm also leads to eq .  .",
    "for the proof of this statement we need the following    let @xmath84 be a fgs of @xmath52 modes , and let @xmath76 denote the tangent space of @xmath35 . then , @xmath85 is a hermitian basis for the tangent space @xmath76 .",
    "( here @xmath86 denotes a _",
    "multi index_. )    we first claim that if @xmath87 is a set of linearly independent operators then so is @xmath88 .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that @xmath36 is a _ positive _ superoperator so that @xmath89 is a set of linearly independent vectors .",
    "next , we show that @xmath90 . to this end",

    "then , the tangent vectors are readily calculated . for all @xmath102",
    "we obtain @xmath103 @xmath104 , @xmath105 @xmath106 , @xmath107 @xmath108 and @xmath109 @xmath110 , where @xmath111 @xmath112 .",
    "further , we find that @xmath113 @xmath114 , @xmath115 @xmath116 , @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath120 .",
    "thus we obtain , for all @xmath121 , the four linearly independent basis vectors @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath126 , we obtain @xmath127 , while @xmath128 .",
    "thus the dimension of the tangent space is @xmath129 .",
    "finally , we show that the operators @xmath130 are hermitian .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that @xmath131 , and that @xmath132 is invertible    with corollary 1 in hand we now directly apply the tdvp projection in our special basis , following eq . .",

    "we find that , as one might expect , on short time scales the gaussified dynamics takes a different path from the exact evolution , but quickly coincides with the exact evolution for intermediate and long time scales .",
