    "nuclear correlations strongly influence the dynamics of nuclear systems",
    ". in particular , the repulsive core at small internucleon distances has the effect of removing the nucleons from their shell model orbitals , producing pairs of nucleons with high and opposite relative momenta .",
    "this results in spreading out a sizable amount of spectral strength , about 10 - 15%  @xcite , to very high missing energies and momenta and in increasing the binding energy of the system  @xcite .",
    "this reduction appears to be fairly independent of the given subshell and on the size of the nucleus , except for a slight increase with the central density of the systems  @xcite .",
    "this is also in line with the existence of two nucleon substructures , similar to the deuteron and independent on the atomic mass , that have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the variational approach and have been found to be driven by short - range and tensor correlations .",
    "theoretical studies of the distribution of short - range correlated nucleons for finite nuclei have been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite and by benhar et al .",
    "these calculations suggest that most of this strength is found along a ridge in the momentum - energy plane ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) which spans several hundreds of mev / c ( and mev ) .",
    "the most probable energy is the one of a free moving nucleon but shifted by a constant term that represents the average two - nucleon separation energy for that pair .",
    "it is important to note that the depletion of single particle orbitals observed near the fermi energy is more substantial than the 15% reduction discussed above  @xcite .",
    "this is mostly due to long - range effects and can not be understood in terms of short - range correlations alone  @xcite .",
    "a proper description of the spectral function at low missing energies usually requires the coupling of the single particle motion to low - energy collective modes ( see for example ref .",
    "however , a proper knowledge of short - range effects remains of great importance for understanding of nuclear systems .",
    "in particular the details of the strength distribution at high missing energy strongly influence the binding energy of finite nuclei and nuclear matter  @xcite . hence , the importance determining this distribution experimentally .",

    "is emitted with momentum @xmath3 and different missing energy and momentum @xmath4 .",
    "due to a successive collision ,",
    "a proton is finally detected with the same momentum @xmath5 seen in the direct process . ]    signatures of correlations have been found in the @xmath6 reaction , where it has been seen that the transition to the ground state of @xmath7 is dominated by short - range effects  @xcite .",
    "two - nucleon emission reactions have the capability of probing the correlated pair directly , therefore obtaining information on short - range correlation already at low missing energies  @xcite .",
    "moreover the effects of collective excitations and final state interactions ( fsi ) represent other important ingredients to which the two - nucleon emission cross sections are sensitive  @xcite .",
    "given the richness of information that can be accessed , one can expect that further studies of two - nucleon emission both theoretically and experimentally are likely have an important impact on the understanding of nuclear structure .    for a long time @xmath0 reactions have provided a useful tool to determine the nuclear spectral functions at small missing energy .",
    "however , past measurements in the region of interest to short - range correlations have been limited due to the enormous background that is generated by final state interactions , see for example ref .",
    "the issue of how to minimize the fsi has been addressed in ref .",
    "there , it is shown that fsi in exclusive @xmath0 cross sections are dominated by two - step processes like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : totres ] .",
    "this becomes particularly relevant when perpendicular kinematics are employed to probe the regions of small spectral strength .",
    "other important contributions are expected to come from @xmath8 reactions followed by the decay of the @xmath9 resonance .",
    "a study of the kinematic conditions shows that for perpendicular kinematics the rescattered nucleons move spectral strength in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , from the top of the ridge toward regions where the correlated strength is small , therefore submerging the direct signal in a large background noise . in ref .",
