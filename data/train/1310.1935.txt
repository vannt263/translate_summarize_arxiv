    "it is well known ( e.g.  @xcite ) that , following the pioneering work of bardeen , carter and hawking @xcite , the `` surface area '' of black holes ( @xmath14 ) is of fundamental interest .",
    "it is non - decreasing through classical ( non - quantum ) processes and is thus generally associated with the black hole entropy .",
    "this raises the naive question as to whether or not the  volume \" of black holes is important .",
    "this question has seen little interest until recently . with the surge in interest in the cosmological constant @xmath13 ,",

    "@xmath16 \" term , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , while the surface area is well - defined and invariant for a @xmath17-dimensional black hole , the volume intrinsic to a @xmath18-dimensional hypersurface depends on the choice of slicing , and the full @xmath17-dimensional volume of the black hole region is formally infinite .    the attempt to find a definition of volume which is both invariant and finite is the inspiration for this work in which we define a `` vector volume '' .",
    "this can be thought of as the rate of change of the invariant four - volume of some region along a vector field .",
    "the vector volume turns out to be a generalization of several other definitions of volume in use by other authors .",
    "moreover , the vector volume has many interesting properties which we examine here .",
    "we show , for example , that in certain ",
    "kerr - schild \" cases , the vector volume reduces to the euclidean volume of a subspace region .",
    "we also offer a new definition of the surface gravity as the ratio of two vector volumes .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ review ] , we review recent developments in which various authors working independently have used similar expressions for black hole volume . in section [ vecvolintrodef ]",
    "we define the vector volume in several different ways which we show to be equivalent . in section [ generalproperties ]",
    "we show some of the vector volume s interesting properties .",

    "here we review several independent recent volume definitions for black holes .",
    "it turns out that these are all special cases of a more general vector volume which we present in this paper .",
    "the work is from parikh @xcite , cveti et al .",
    "@xcite , and hayward ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for the most part we use the notation used by the authors in their papers .",
    "we note that the authors of this paper have independently developed a definition of volume which is in a similar vein to these @xcite .      in 2006",
    ", parikh @xcite defined a volume for stationary black holes . in his paper",
    ", parikh begins by considering a @xmath17-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime with a timelike killing vector and a horizon , with line element @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the line element for the @xmath22-sphere , @xmath23 is the aerial radius , @xmath24 is a vector representation of the coordinates on the @xmath22-sphere , @xmath25 is the static time coordinate and @xmath26 is some function of @xmath23 .",
    "the killing vector @xmath27 is the killing vector corresponding to staticity , which is timelike outside the horizon .",
    "the horizon is at a radius @xmath28 for which @xmath29 . at this value ,",
    "the metric is non - regular , so parikh introduces a new time coordinate @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 @xmath32 will be a killing vector for any constant @xmath33 , but in order to preserve the time orientation and asymptotic normalization of the killing vector , @xmath33 is set to + 1 in parikh s definition , so that @xmath34 .",
    "the advantage to this new coordinate @xmath30 over @xmath25 is that for certain functions @xmath35 it is possible to obtain a slicing that extends through the horizon .",
    "parikh then notes that while the @xmath18-dimensional volume of the region @xmath36 on the hypersurfaces of constant @xmath30 depends on the choice of function @xmath35 , one can instead define a `` differential spacetime volume '' @xmath37 which is invariant .",
    "this differential spacetime volume is the @xmath17-volume of the region where @xmath38 varies between @xmath30 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the determinant of the full @xmath17-dimensional metric .",
    "since @xmath32 is a killing vector , the metric @xmath42 is independent of @xmath30 , and thus @xmath30 enters into @xmath37 only through the multiplicative term @xmath43 .",
    "the parikh volume is defined as the ratio of this differential spacetime volume to @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the product of the differentials except for @xmath43 .",
    "essentially , one uses @xmath41 instead of @xmath46 ( the determinant of the metric of the @xmath47 hypersurfaces ) , which makes the volume constant in time for all choices of killing time , and invariant under the choice of stationary time slices .    though he used static spherical symmetry as an example , parikh notes that his volume definition can similarly be applied to any stationary black hole .",
    "in particular , parikh notes that the volume for static , spherically symmetric black holes in 4 dimensions , as before with horizon at @xmath28 , is @xmath48 which is of course simply the euclidean volume for a sphere of radius @xmath49 .",
    "the volume for the ( four - dimensional ) kerr black hole is given by parikh as @xmath50 where @xmath49 and @xmath51 have their usual meanings as the value of radius @xmath23 at the outer horizon and specific angular momentum respectively .    before continuing ,",
    "we make a further note about the parikh volume .",
    "using the well - known horizon area @xmath52 we can write ( [ vpk ] ) in the form @xmath53 a result we revisit in future sections",
    ".      the laws of black hole thermodynamics with a non - zero cosmological constant term @xmath13 , as well as the generalized smarr formula , where put into a general geometrical approach in @xcite . here ,",
    "to be specific , we follow @xcite .",
    "( see as well the references therein and subsequent work @xcite . )",
    "the argument goes in essence as follows . in black hole spacetimes with @xmath13 , the black hole",
    "thermodynamic variation laws can be written in terms of a black hole enthalpy @xmath54 , giving rise to a modified first law of thermodynamics , @xmath55 or , in non - differential smarr - gibbs - duhem form , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the effective temperature of the black hole , @xmath58 is the entropy , @xmath59 are the components of the angular momenta , @xmath60 are the corresponding angular velocities , @xmath61 are the conserved charges , @xmath62 are the potentials corresponding to those charges , and @xmath63 is the conjugate to @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath13 can be interpreted as a pressure ( up to a multiplicative constant ) , @xmath63 is interpreted as being proportional to a volume for the black hole , by analogy with the classical thermodynamical first law for enthalpy @xmath64 in terms of temperature @xmath57 , entropy @xmath58 , pressure @xmath65 , volume @xmath16 and work @xmath66 , @xmath67 this yields a relationship between a  thermodynamic \" volume @xmath68 and @xmath63 : @xmath69 where @xmath17 is the dimension of the spacetime . with spherical symmetry",
    ", @xmath68 corresponds to the  naive \" geometrical volume @xmath70 where @xmath23 ranges over the black hole and @xmath71 is the surface element on the unit @xmath22 sphere . for black holes with non - zero angular momentum ,",
    "the thermodynamic and gemoetric volumes differ by @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the rotational parameters for the black hole corresponding to the @xmath59 .",
    "the geometric volume satisfies the relation @xmath74 for all black holes of the kerr - newman - de sitter family , generalizing ( [ vpa ] ) .",
    "again , we return to this below . of central importance here",
    "is the fact that @xmath75 the geometrical and parikh volumes are equivalent .      in several papers ( for example @xcite , among others )",
    ", hayward defines a volume for dynamical black holes in terms of the kodama vector , an analogue to the killing vector in dynamical spacetimes .",
    "he makes a similar development for cylindrical symmetry in @xcite , but we will focus here on the spherical symmetry case as an example .",
    "the line element for four - dimensional dynamic spherically symmetric spacetime can be written in the form @xmath76 where there are two coordinates @xmath77 in addition to the coordinates @xmath78 within the 2-sphere metric @xmath79 . here",
    ", @xmath80 is the aerial radius .",
    "an analogue to the killing vector in dynamic spherical symmetry is the kodama vector , which we will label by @xmath81 .",
    "an important property of the kodama vector is that it becomes null on and only on the trapping horizon of a dynamic black hole , a property that is analogous to the killing vector becoming null on and only on the killing horizon of a stationary black hole .",
    "the kodama vector @xmath81 is defined as the curl of the aerial radius , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the volume form associated with the 2-metric @xmath84 from , or @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the levi - civita tensor for the two dimensions @xmath77 in .",
    "the kodama vector agrees with the usual timelike killing vector in stationary spherically symmetric spacetimes if @xmath81 commutes with @xmath87 . in these cases",
    "the line element can be written as @xmath88 where the killing and kodama vectors are @xmath89 .",
    "in general , if @xmath90 is allowed to vary with @xmath30 in line elements of the form @xmath91 then the kodama vector is @xmath92 , though it is obviously only a killing vector if the line - element is @xmath30-independent .",
    "the kodama vector ( in spherical symmetry only ) has the property @xmath93 which , along with the gauss theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) , implies a conserved quantity hayward defines to be the volume , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a spacelike hypersurface and @xmath8 is the volume element of the surface times a future directed normal .",
    "( the absolute value signs are to avoid having to deal with the sign of the result . )",
    "if the horizon of a black hole is located by @xmath28 , then the volume can be defined as with @xmath95 being the region @xmath96 , with result @xmath97 . in the spherically symmetric case and with the kodama vector",
    "the usual timelike killing vector then @xmath98      in @xcite , we defined a volume rate for stationary non - degenerate black holes . to define this rate , we considered a region of the black hole bounded by the event horizon and two distinct ingoing null cones , as shown schematically in figure  [ diagram ] .",
    "then , by allowing the intersection of the ingoing null cone with the event horizon to vary , it was found that the four - volume of this region grows as @xmath99 , where @xmath33 is the affine generator of the horizon and the constant of proportionality is the volume @xmath100 divided by the surface gravity @xmath101 of the black hole .",
    "thus we define the null generator volume as @xmath102    the easiest way to demonstrate this volume is to use ingoing eddington - finkelstein - like coordinates .",
    "for metrics of the form ( [ metricone ] ) ( dropping the subscript @xmath103 on @xmath30 ) define @xmath104 , from which the line element becomes @xmath105 here , @xmath106 labels sets of ingoing null geodesics .",
    "the @xmath17-volume of the region between @xmath107 and a larger ( arbitrary ) value of @xmath16 is @xmath108 and so @xmath109 assuming asymptotic flatness ( @xmath110 as @xmath111 ) , the relationship between @xmath30 and thus @xmath16 and an affine parameter @xmath33 on the event horizon is given by @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath101 is the surface gravity of the black hole ; in this case then @xmath113 up to an additive constant , and we can write @xmath114 as claimed .    this procedure can be generalized for other non - degenerate stationary metrics , for example , in kerr - newman along principal ingoing null geodesics .",
    "in this section we define a vector volume rate ( which we also refer to as the  vector volume \" ) in any space or spacetime with respect to any divergence - free vector field @xmath1 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the set of divergence - free vectors of course includes all killing vectors .",
    "the vector volume of a @xmath17-dimensional region @xmath116 with respect to @xmath1 is written as @xmath117 .",
    "the vector @xmath1 must satisfy @xmath118 where @xmath119 is normal to the boundary of @xmath116 .",
    "we will now introduce two definitions of @xmath117 .",
    "section [ differentiallike ] defines it as a derivative of the @xmath17-volume of region @xmath116 along the vector field @xmath1 .",
    "section [ haywardlike ] defines it as an integral of the vector @xmath1 over a hypersurface .",
    "these two definitions are then shown to be equivalent . a third definition , which uses perhaps less familiar terminology , is included as appendix [ vve ] .",
    "define @xmath120 as the @xmath17-dimensional volume of region @xmath116 .",
    "the essential point is to define a volume for which we use the derivative of the scalar volume along the vector field @xmath6 : @xmath121 unfortunately , @xmath120 is not well - defined as a local quantity . in order to provide a meaning to we",
    "must define @xmath120 as a quantity which depends in some specific way on the coordinates .",
    "one method is to consider the congruence of integral curves of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath122 be the point lying at parameter distance @xmath5 along the integral curve of @xmath6 starting at point @xmath123 .",
    "define @xmath124 as an arbitrary hypersurface of dimension @xmath18 which intersects every integral curve of @xmath6 exactly once .",
    "then @xmath125 is a hypersurface region which lies entirely within @xmath116 and intersects each integral curve within @xmath116 exactly once .",
    "finally , define @xmath126 as the region which lies within @xmath116 , for which each point within @xmath126 can be expressed as @xmath127 in other words , @xmath128 is the subregion of @xmath116 for which every point is at most a parameter distance of @xmath5 from @xmath124 along the integral curves of @xmath6 .",
    "the situation is shown schematically in figure [ diagram2 ] .",
    "since @xmath129 from ( [ meaningless ] ) we have @xmath130 further , since @xmath117 is , as we will show , a constant , this volume rate can be written as the ratio @xmath131 these relations provide a simple interpretation of the vector volume : it is the growth rate of the @xmath17-dimensional volume @xmath116 along the vector field @xmath6 .",
    "we show later in this section and in section [ haywardlike ] that @xmath117 is independent of @xmath5 and the particular choice of hypersurface @xmath124 .    for ease of computation here",
    "we now use adapted coordinates @xmath132 in which @xmath133 , and where @xmath124 is defined by @xmath134 .",
    "the computation of @xmath135 is now straightforward .",
    "the region @xmath126 is simply equal to the subregion of @xmath116 for which @xmath136 .",
    "we can define this region as @xmath137 for @xmath138 . as a result",
    ", the vector volume can be written as    @xmath139    since @xmath116 is defined by the normal to its boundaries being perpendicular to @xmath1 , we can define @xmath116 in these coordinates as @xmath140 for some @xmath18-dimensional region @xmath95 .",
    "( this results in @xmath141 having no @xmath142 component , confirming that @xmath143 as required . )",
    "then @xmath137 becomes the set of points for which @xmath140 and the @xmath142 values which lie within the region vary between @xmath144 and the @xmath142 parameter within the expression .",
    "@xmath145 is given by the @xmath17-space integral , @xmath146 where @xmath41 is the determinant of the metric @xmath42 and @xmath147 is the product of the differentials excepting @xmath148 .",
    "we note further that since @xmath149 , and using the relationship @xmath150 for an arbitrary vector field @xmath151 , we find @xmath152 from which we find that the metric determinant is independent of coordinate @xmath142 .",
    "this implies that the vector volume is expressible as @xmath153 which is independent of @xmath142 and thus @xmath5 .",
    "we also note that this is the same form as the definition for the parikh volume and of the cveti et al .  geometric volume .",
    "thus the vector volume is a generalization of the parikh and geometric volumes .",
    "this connection will be further explored in section [ canon ] .",
    "we can show the invariance under the choice of slicing hypersurface @xmath124 here but it will be easier to do so in the following section .",
    "the second definition is similar to that used by hayward to construct the kodama volume as discussed in section [ haywardkodama ] and given by ( [ haywardv ] ) .",
    "recall there that @xmath95 slices the region @xmath154 bounded by the black hole trapping horizon ( whose normal is orthogonal to the kodama vector ) and @xmath8 is the directed surface element of @xmath95 .",
    "we note that the kodama vector is , in certain situations , divergence - free .",
    "we can generalize this definition to write the vector volume in a similar form . replacing @xmath81 with @xmath1 , @xmath154 with a region @xmath116",
    "whose normal is orthogonal to @xmath1 , and @xmath95 with @xmath125 , with @xmath124 as defined in the previous subsection , we have @xmath155 where here @xmath8 is the directed surface element of @xmath124 .",
    "we note here that we can always choose the orientation of @xmath125 such that the integral is positive .",
    "we choose an adapted coordinate system wherein @xmath133 , @xmath116 is defined by @xmath140 , and @xmath134 corresponds to @xmath124 .",
    "then @xmath8 is equal to @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the product of the differentials of @xmath158 .",
    "the integral becomes @xmath159 this recovers and thus shows that is equivalent to the definitions given in section [ differentiallike ] . for a parallel development using",
    "differential forms see appendix a.    we now demonstrate that this volume is independent of the choice of particular hypersurface @xmath124 . to do this",
    ", we define a region @xmath160 which is bounded by two possible ( nonintersecting ) hypersurfaces @xmath124 , say @xmath161 and @xmath162 , as well as the boundaries of @xmath116 .",
    "we now say that @xmath162 points `` outward '' and @xmath161 points `` inward , '' so that the closed integral of the vector field over the boundary of @xmath160 is given by @xmath163 where of course @xmath164 is zero on @xmath165 since the normal is orthogonal to @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the first term , by the divergence theorem , is equal to @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the volume element @xmath168 . rearranging ,",
    "this implies @xmath169 since @xmath115 , @xmath170 a standard application of gauss theorem . in words , @xmath171 is the  flux \" associated with the conservation of @xmath2 .",
    "however , note that for any vector field @xmath172 which is not divergence free , an attempt to use the definition here for the vector volume will yield a result that is dependent on the choice of hypersurface @xmath124",
    ".      since the covariant derivative and thus the divergence are linear functions , the divergence of any linear combination of two divergence - free vectors is zero . as a result ,",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath173 are valid vectors to define a vector volume , so will a linear combination of those vectors . in what follows in this section",
    "we examine how linear combinations of choices of vector affects the resulting vector volume .",
    "let us first show that the vector volume of a region @xmath116 with respect to a non - zero positive constant @xmath174 times a given vector field @xmath6 is that same constant @xmath174 times the vector volume of @xmath116 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "that is , @xmath175 to show this we use .",
    "since the integral curves for the vector fields @xmath6 and @xmath176 are the same , we can use the same hypersurface region @xmath124 to represent the hypersurface which lies within @xmath116 and intersects the integral curve(s ) exactly once .",
    "then we can write @xmath177 as required .",
    "if @xmath174 is a negative constant , then the result will be @xmath178 because the orientation of the hypersurface , and thus the sign of @xmath8 , is always chosen so that the volume rate is positive .",
    "we can not choose @xmath179 because the vector volume with respect to a zero vector field is not defined .",
    "here we seek the relationship between the vector volumes of divergence - free vectors @xmath1 and @xmath173 and the vector volume of @xmath180 .",
    "we can only compare the vector volumes for @xmath181 and @xmath180 if they are volumes corresponding to a common region @xmath116 .",
    "this only occurs if the normal to @xmath116 is perpendicular throughout to both @xmath1 and @xmath173 .",
    "if we can find a case in which the boundary of @xmath116 is parallel to both @xmath6 and @xmath182 , and @xmath124 intersects the integral curves of both exactly once , while they are oriented the same direction , then the vector volume is a simple sum since @xmath183    one possible situation in which the normal to @xmath165 is perpendicular to two appropriate vector fields @xmath1 and @xmath173 is the case in which @xmath173 is a vector attached to closed , cyclic curves .",
    "assume that we can choose an adapted coordinate system where @xmath133 , @xmath184 , and orbits of @xmath185 of length @xmath65 are closed , such that the points @xmath186 and @xmath187 are coincident .",
    "the most obvious instance of this is in spaces or spacetimes with azimuthal symmetry wherein @xmath188 and @xmath189 for the usual azimuthal symmetry vector @xmath10 .",
    "a region @xmath116 whose boundary normal is perpendicular to both @xmath1 and @xmath173 must have the form @xmath190 for some @xmath22-dimensional region @xmath191 , where there are no boundaries on @xmath142 or @xmath192 .",
    "we note that the integral curves of @xmath1 can be represented by @xmath193 , and the integral curves of @xmath194 , for non - zero constant @xmath64 , can be written as @xmath195 , @xmath196 for some @xmath197 constant along each integral curve .",
    "we note that the choice of @xmath124 as the hypersurface region @xmath134 , @xmath190 has the property that it intersects each integral curve of @xmath1 and @xmath194 exactly once , so it is a suitable choice for the hypersurface @xmath124 .",
    "we can then calculate @xmath198 : @xmath199 in our adapted coordinates , @xmath200 , so that @xmath201 and so we find that in this particular situation @xmath202 we can summarize this by saying that if @xmath1 is a divergence free vector , @xmath173 is a `` cyclic '' divergence - free vector ( as defined above ) , and @xmath116 is a region whose boundary normal is perpendicular to both , then the vector volume @xmath203 with respect to the vector @xmath194 is equal to the vector volume @xmath117 . combining this result with the result of the previous subsection , we have @xmath204 we make use of ( [ cvhw ] ) below .",
    "a generalized kerr - schild spacetime ( e.g.  @xcite ) has the form @xmath205 where @xmath206 where @xmath207 with inverse @xmath208 is some `` background '' metric , often flat space , @xmath209 is a scalar function , and @xmath210 is a vector which is null in both the background and full metric .",
    "further , the components of @xmath210 can be raised and lowered using either metric : @xmath211 examples of spacetimes which can be expressed as kerr - schild metrics with a minkowski background are all spherically symmetric spacetimes and the kerr - newman spacetime .",
    "kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter is an example of a spacetime which can be written in kerr - schild form with a non - flat background ( in this case , ( anti ) de sitter ) .",
    "the two spacetimes with metrics @xmath42 and @xmath207 can be expressed in the same coordinates , and we can introduce a vector @xmath1 which is well defined according to both backgrounds by setting its components to be equal . note that the covector associated with @xmath1 is in general not the same when @xmath1 is lowered by both metrics , since in general @xmath212    the matrix determinant lemma ( e.g.  @xcite ) states that if @xmath213 is an invertible square matrix and @xmath214 and @xmath6 are column vectors , then @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the transpose of vector @xmath6 and @xmath217 is the inverse of matrix @xmath213 .",
    "now consider the determinant of @xmath218 we can represent this sum as a square matrix with the @xmath219 index changing along the rows and the @xmath220 index changing along the columns . in this case",
    "we can represent @xmath207 by @xmath213 , @xmath208 by @xmath217 , @xmath221 by @xmath216 and @xmath222 by @xmath214 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath223 in this representation .",
    "thus we find @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath226 represent the determinants of @xmath42 and @xmath207 respectively .",
    "this relies on the fact that @xmath210 is null with respect to @xmath207 .",
    "the equality of the determinants of the full metric and background metric implies that the volume element for the full spacetime ( @xmath227 ) is equal to the volume element for the background spacetime ( @xmath228 ) : @xmath229 this indicates that the @xmath17-volume of some region can be calculated using either the full metric or the background metric .",
    "this is not in general true for @xmath230-volumes where @xmath231 within the spacetime ( such as lengths when @xmath232 , areas when @xmath233 etc . ) ,  since the sub - determinants are not in general equal for @xmath42 and @xmath207 .",
    "we note now that definition 1 of the vector volume requires only a vector @xmath1 and the @xmath17-volume of some region @xmath116 parameterized by @xmath5 , which is a function of the coordinates .",
    "since @xmath1 , the coordinates , and the @xmath17-volume are equivalent in the full spacetime and in the background spacetime , we find that the vector volume with respect to @xmath1 of a region @xmath116 in a kerr - schild spacetime @xmath42 is identical to the vector volume with respect to @xmath1 of the background spacetime .",
    "we can also see that the vector volume is the same in both the full spacetime and background using expression and using the equality of the two determinants .",
    "we note before continuing that a vector which is divergence free according to @xmath42 will also be divergence - free according to @xmath207 : @xmath234 this allows us to see that a vector which is valid for calculating the vector volume in the background spacetime will be valid for calculating the vector volume in the full spacetime .",
    "the fact that the vector volume with respect to a full spacetime is equal to the vector volume calculated for its background spacetime is of particular importance and interest when the background spacetime is minkowski space .",
    "let @xmath235 and move for the moment into lorentzian coordinates @xmath236 where the @xmath237 are @xmath238 spatial coordinates .",
    "the metric can be expressed as @xmath239 now define @xmath240 according to @xmath241 .",
    "then if we have some region @xmath116 defined by @xmath140 , where @xmath95 is some @xmath18-dimensional spatial region , the vector volume of @xmath116 with respect to @xmath240 in the background space is , from , @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the euclidean volume of the spatial component of region @xmath116 in the flat background spacetime . since the vector volume is equal regardless of whether we choose the flat background or the full metric , the vector volume with respect to @xmath240 for the full spacetime @xmath42 will be equal to the euclidean volume for the spatial part of the region , as calculated in the flat background .",
    "we can extend the argument given above further .",
    "with the specific example of the kerr-(anti ) de sitter metric , we note that it is possible to have a metric which can be expressed in kerr - schild form with a non - minkowski background , which _ itself _ can be expressed in kerr - schild form . in other words , we let the full metric be expressed , as before , in the form @xmath244 where , in the particular case of kerr-(anti ) de sitter , @xmath207 is the metric for ( anti ) de sitter spacetime and @xmath210 is a null vector with respect to both @xmath42 and @xmath207 . from the previous section we have @xmath245 . in the kerr-(anti )",
    "de sitter case , we can break this down even further by expressing the ( anti ) de sitter metric in terms of the flatspace metric , say @xmath246 , and a vector @xmath247 , which is `` null '' with respect to @xmath246 and @xmath207 , but not necessarily @xmath42 .",
    "the reason for this is that the ( anti ) de sitter spacetime can itself be expressed in kerr - schild form .",
    "however , the `` null vector '' in this form will not necessarily be null in the global kerr-(anti ) de sitter spacetime .",
    "we can write this as @xmath248 now we set @xmath208 and @xmath249 as the inverses of @xmath207 and @xmath246 , and ( for lack of a better name ) set @xmath250 as the `` contravariant '' form of @xmath247 within the background spacetime ( which will not , in general , be equal to @xmath251 for the full spacetime ) .",
    "note that  @xmath252 , where @xmath253 .",
    "we know also from that @xmath208 can be written as @xmath254 and so we can decompose the spacetime into a form @xmath255 where @xmath246 is the metric tensor for flat space , @xmath256 is a correction from minkowski to ( anti ) de sitter , and @xmath257 is a correction from ( anti ) de sitter to kerr-(anti ) de sitter . since @xmath245 and @xmath252 , we find that @xmath258 .",
    "the determinant of the metric tensor , and thus the associated vector volume , is the same for the kerr-(anti)de sitter spacetime and the background - background metric .",
    "we can now retrace the argument given above and arrive back at ( [ euclid ] ) .",
    "note that the contravariant metric equation for this `` double kerr - schild '' form is slightly complicated because @xmath259 ; in fact @xmath260 .",
    "if we set @xmath261 , we can write the contravariant metric equation somewhat compactly as @xmath262    the primary application of the vector volume is to stationary black holes , i.e.  black holes with a killing vector corresponding to time translation which is timelike outside the black hole horizon .",
    "we expand on two cases below .",
    "the first is the canonical black hole volume , defined and discussed in section [ canon ] , which is equivalent to the volume considered by parikh as reviewed in section [ parikhintro ] and the geometric volume defined by cveti et al .  as reviewed in section [ cveticgeometricvolume ] and",
    "is similar to hayward s volume @xcite .",
    "the second is related to the volume introduced in section [ ourvolumeintro ] .",
    "this is examined in section [ ourvolume ] .",
    "in this section we define and examine the `` canonical black hole volume '' for stationary spacetimes . we define this as the vector volume of the region below the event horizon of a black hole , with respect to the canonical killing vector which corresponds to stationarity .",
    "we will label this volume @xmath263 .",
    "in general , for time coordinate @xmath30 we will write the corresponding killing vector as @xmath9 , where @xmath264 ; instead of @xmath30 sometimes @xmath57 or @xmath265 or another coordinate may be used .",
    "we note that the canonical black hole volume is equivalent to the volume that parikh defines in his paper @xcite as well as the geometric volume defined by cveti et al .",
    "@xcite    to define the canonical black hole volume explicitly , assume that there is a stationary @xmath17-dimensional black hole which can be written in coordinates @xmath266 adapted to the killing vector which corresponds to the black hole s stationarity , which takes the form @xmath32 .",
    "we also demand that @xmath32 be properly normalized , if possible , a condition which we elaborate on in section  [ normalizationcanon ] .",
    "let the region below the horizon be @xmath140 , where @xmath95 is a @xmath18-dimensional region . the line element can be written as @xmath267 where , since these coordinates are adapted to the killing vector @xmath32 , the components of @xmath42 are independent of @xmath30 .",
    "if we let @xmath41 be the determinant of the metric @xmath42 , then from we can write the canonical black hole volume as @xmath268 compare to and .",
    "remarkably , if @xmath269 is a killing vector corresponding to axial symmetry such that @xmath270 is a cyclic coordinate , it follows from that the vector volumes for the black hole calculated using killing vectors @xmath9 and @xmath11 are identical for any constant @xmath12 : @xmath271 a consequence of this , for example , is that in stationary , axisymmetric black holes with some angular momentum , we can calculate the canonical bh volume using either the stationarity killing vector @xmath32 or the killing vector @xmath272 which is tangent to the null generators of the horizon .",
    "an important point remains .",
    "we have to ensure that the vector @xmath273 has the proper normalization . in his paper",
    ", parikh suggests fixing the asymptotic normalization of the killing vector , but this becomes problematic in spacetimes with @xmath13 .",
    "consider first an asymptotically flat stationary black hole with axial symmetry .",
    "how should we fix the asymptotic normalization of the killing vector corresponding to stationarity ?",
    "following carter @xcite , the normalization for the vector corresponding to stationary , say @xmath240 , is set by @xmath274 where the limit is taken at spatial infinity . in spacetime with time symmetry but no spatial translational symmetry , this defines the killing vector uniquely .",
    "( if a translational spacelike killing vector exists , it is possible to create a new well - normalized timelike killing vector by a linear combination of the time killing vector with the spatial killing vector , as in minkowski space . )",
    "spacetimes with axial symmetry have a rotation killing vector , say @xmath275 , which is zero on the rotation axis , whose normalization can be fixed by requiring @xmath276 where @xmath277 and the limit is taken on the rotation axis .",
    "this is what ensures the standard periodicity @xmath278 @xcite .",
    "as explained above , any killing vector of the form @xmath279 will yield the same canonical volume .",
    "now the magnitude squared of @xmath280 will be everywhere equal to that of @xmath240 only if @xmath281 , since @xmath282 however , since @xmath283 on the rotation axis , any valid killing vector @xmath280 for calculating the volume will have @xmath284 with the limit taken to spatial infinity on the rotation axis .",
    "we can use this as the condition for the normalization of the killing vector to produce the proper canonical bh volume in axisymmetric spacetimes which are asymptotically flat .",
    "if the space is _ not _ asymptotically flat , then it is more challenging to define the proper normalization . in the case of",
    "static spherical symmetry , metrics of the form ( [ metricone ] ) ( with @xmath285 ) , i.e.  ones wherein @xmath286 , are important due to the vanishing radial null - null component of the ricci tensor @xcite .",
    "such spacetimes include the reissner - nordstrom-(anti ) de sitter class .",
    "now if we take @xmath287 , the condition @xmath286 suggests that the normalization condition @xmath288 here , @xmath23 is a uniquely defined coordinate since surfaces of @xmath289 are spheres with surface area @xmath290 ( in the 4 dimensional case ) .",
    "this still leaves spacetimes which are not asymptotically flat and which do not possess spherical symmetry ; an example here is kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter case , which has line element    @xmath291    here , @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 , and @xmath13 is the cosmological constant , opposite in sign to that in @xcite . as in @xcite",
    "we assume here that @xmath296 for @xmath297 .",
    "the @xmath111 limit of this metric , we note , is outside the cosmological horizon for @xmath298 , and the metric does not reduce to flat space asymptotically .",
    "not only that , but @xmath23 is no longer a coordinate for which the surfaces @xmath289 represent spheres of symmetry , but ellipsoids of symmetry instead .",
    "nevertheless , by analogy with the requirement that a well - normalized killing vector @xmath280 has @xmath299 on the rotation axis in asymptotically flat spacetime with axial symmetry , and that @xmath286 is a proper normalization in spherical symmetry , we are led to the following question : what if we require , in the case of kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter , @xmath300 where the limit is taken for large @xmath23 on the rotation axis ?",
    "remarkably , in the kerr - newman- ( anti ) de sitter metric , setting @xmath301 ( for any constant @xmath12 ) yields @xmath302 _ everywhere _ on the rotation axis ( where @xmath303 and the norm of @xmath280 are defined ) .",
    "this saves us the difficulty of worrying about , for example , going beyond the cosmological horizon and seems to be a reasonable normalization requirement .",
    "there is another potential method for choosing the `` correct '' time - symmetry killing vector for metrics which can be expressed in kerr - schild or `` double kerr - schild '' form with a flat background .",
    "if we have a metric which can be expressed in kerr - schild form or `` double kerr - schild form '' wherein there is a minkowski background , another sensible way to choose the killing vector @xmath240 corresponding to stationarity is to choose a killing vector such that , if @xmath304 represents the flat background , @xmath305 this definition allows us to write the background spacetime in coordinates @xmath236 , where @xmath306 . in cases where the metric is axially",
    "symmetric , we can extend this definition to any vector @xmath307 ( where @xmath275 is the killing vector for axial symmetry ) by requiring @xmath308    the advantage here is that if there is a flat background @xmath304 , the canonical black hole volume would then , from the results of section [ kerrschildtype ] , be the euclidean volume for the spatial component of the black hole , as calculated in the flat background . as we will show in the following subsection , in the cases of static spherical symmetry in the form ( [ metricone ] ) , kerr - newman black holes , and kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter black holes , this normalization scheme , and the ones presented in the previous subsection , are consistent with each other .",
    "thus , in these cases , we can show that the canonical black hole volume is equal to the euclidean volume of the spatial component of the black hole region .",
    "we will work in four dimensions for these examples .",
    "consider the spherically symmetric metric ( [ metricone ] ) .",
    "if this is a black hole , there is some value @xmath49 for which @xmath309 and @xmath310 just outside it .",
    "thus the black hole region is defined by @xmath36 .",
    "we note that @xmath9 with @xmath311 is a killing vector for which @xmath312 , so @xmath9 is a valid vector for calculating the canonical black hole volume : @xmath313 which , as parikh noted when he did his calculation for a spherically symmetric black hole , is the euclidean volume of a 2-sphere of radius @xmath49 .",
    "we can show that this makes sense by rewriting ( [ metricone ] ) in kerr - schild form by choosing a new coordinate system @xmath314 where @xmath315 and defining a null vector @xmath210 by @xmath316 then , setting @xmath317 , which is minkowski space in spherical polar coordinates , we can write the metric as @xmath318 which is in kerr - schild form . further , @xmath319 .",
    "this confirms that the volume of a region with respect to @xmath9 is the euclidean volume of the spatial component of the region , as calculated in the flat background with metric tensor @xmath304 .",
    "this provides a clear explanation for why the canonical black hole volume is the euclidean volume for spherical black holes .",
    "the line element for the kerr - newman black hole , which is asymptotically flat , can be written in boyer - lindquist coordinates as    @xmath320    where @xmath321 , @xmath322 with mass @xmath323 , charge @xmath324 and rotational parameter @xmath51 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the outer horizon lies at @xmath325 .",
    "the vector @xmath9 with @xmath311 is killing and @xmath326 asymptotically , so it is a good vector for the calculation of the canonical black hole volume .",
    "the canonical black hole volume then is @xmath327    while it is not immediately obvious that the expression on the right is equal to the euclidean volume of the background metric in kerr - newman , this is also the case .",
    "the kerr - schild form of the kerr - newman black hole in lorentzian coordinates @xmath328 can be written as @xcite @xmath329 where @xmath330 , @xmath331 and @xmath210 is a null vector with @xmath332 the coordinate @xmath23 is the usual boyer - lindquist @xmath23 defined in these cartesian coordinates by @xmath333 surfaces of constant @xmath23 are _ ellipsoids _ in @xmath334 , where the semi - major axes are @xmath335 for the @xmath336 and @xmath337 directions and @xmath23 for the @xmath338-direction .",
    "the relationship between @xmath57 and the coordinates @xmath339 is @xmath340 we can confirm that @xmath341 .",
    "thus , we confirm that @xmath342 and so the canonical black hole volume for the kerr - newman black hole is equal to the the euclidean volume of the spatial component of the flat background of the kerr - newman black hole when written in kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "since the horizon is at @xmath28 , the flatspace interpretation of the volume of the region @xmath36 is not the volume of a sphere but the volume of an _ ellipsoid _ with semi - major axes @xmath343 , and @xmath23 ( for @xmath344 and @xmath338 directions respectively ) .",
    "the euclidean volume of an ellipsoid with semi - major axes @xmath345 and @xmath182 is @xmath346 , which in this case is @xmath347 , confirming that the canonical black hole volume of the kerr - newman black hole is in fact its euclidean volume in this set of coordinates .",
    "the line element for kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter is given in and in these coordinates the metric determinant @xmath348 is @xmath349 the black hole region is given by @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the appropriate root to @xmath352 .",
    "if we use the vector @xmath353 to calculate volume as discussed in section [ normalizationcanon ] , then we obtain @xmath354 again , the expression on the right is not immediately familiar , but as explained below this corresponds to a euclidean volume expression .",

    "it is not readily apparent that the expression for @xmath362 is the line element for ( anti ) de sitter spacetime , but by making the substitutions defined implicitly by @xcite @xmath363 we find that @xmath362 becomes @xmath364 which is the familiar form with radial coordinate @xmath365 and angular coordinate @xmath63 . by defining coordinate @xmath57 by @xmath366",
    "we can rewrite @xmath362 as @xmath367 where @xmath368 ( which is a null vector in the ( anti ) de sitter background and the minkowski background ) and @xmath369 which is the familiar form for minkowski space in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "this means that the full kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter metric becomes @xmath370 where @xmath304 is the minkowski metric , @xmath210 is a null vector in the full kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter spacetime and the ( anti ) de sitter background , and @xmath247 is a null vector in the ( anti ) de sitter background and the flat background for the ( anti ) de sitter background .",
    "if we call the killing vector used to define the canonical black hole volume @xmath371 from before , we note that it is also equal to @xmath372 .",

    "if we use @xmath375 for the vector to calculate the canonical black hole volume we will again calculate the euclidean volume of the flat background .    in the case of kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter , the black hole region is bounded by one of the solutions to @xmath376 ; let us call the solution which gives the event horizon @xmath377 .",

    "if we define euclidean coordinates ( @xmath378 ) by @xmath379 in the usual way , we find a relationship between @xmath334 and @xmath23 as @xmath380 this implies that surfaces of constant @xmath23 are ellipsoids with two semi - major axes @xmath381 and one semi - major axis @xmath23 .",
    "the euclidean volume inside the region bounded by @xmath377 then would be @xmath382 as we discovered .",
    "once again the canonical black hole volume corresponds to the euclidean volume of the black hole region .",
    "the invariant surface area of the horizon @xmath383 ( calculated in the usual way ) of a spherically symmetric black hole with horizon radius @xmath49 is simply @xmath384 .",
    "the surface area of a kerr - newman black hole horizon is @xmath385 and the surface area of a kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter black hole horizon is @xmath386 .",
    "we note then that in all three cases the ratio of the canonical black hole volume @xmath387 to the black hole surface area is : @xmath388 which recovers .    in spherical symmetry with coordinates of a form like ( [ metricone ] ) , surfaces of constant @xmath389 have surface area @xmath390 for all @xmath23 .",
    "however , in the kerr - newman ( and kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter ) case the area only has the above form on the horizons ; for example , in kerr - newman , taking a 2-surface @xmath124 defined by @xmath391 gives a line element ( from ) @xmath392 from which the area is @xmath393 for simplicity , define @xmath394 which will be zero only on the horizons .",
    "then the area of a surface of constant @xmath395 can be written as    @xmath396    this shows that the relationship is a property of the horizon alone , since @xmath397 if and only if @xmath398 .",
    "we note also that the area is calculated through very different means than the vector volume .",
    "while the canonical black hole volume , for example , turns out to be equal to the euclidean volume of the flat space background , the surface area of the horizon in kerr - newman and kerr - newman-(anti ) de sitter is not what is expected from the surface area of ellipsoids in euclidean space . in kerr - newman , wherein the minkowski representation of @xmath399 is an ellipsoid with one semi - axis @xmath365 and two semi - axes @xmath400 , the euclidean surface area of these 2-surfaces is @xmath401 where @xmath402 is the ellipticity of the ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "as stated in section [ ourvolumeintro ] , in @xcite we defined a black hole volume by @xmath403 where @xmath33 is the null affine generator on the horizon . we will now show that in stationary , axially symmetric black holes this volume is equal to the vector volume of the black hole region with respect to the ( unique ) killing vector @xmath404 for which @xmath405 on the horizon .",
    "spacetimes which are stationary and axially symmetric permit a killing vector @xmath406 which is tangent to the null generators of the horizon , for which ( again , on the horizon only ) @xcite @xmath407 where @xmath101 is the surface gravity of the horizon .",
    "generally speaking , @xmath406 is written as @xmath408 where @xmath9 is the killing vector corresponding to stationarity and @xmath10 the killing vector corresponding to axial symmetry , both of which have the properties explained in section [ normalizationcanon ] , and @xmath409 is the angular velocity which is a constant .",
    "if @xmath406 is multiplied by a non - zero constant @xmath209 , then becomes @xmath410 which means that for the new vector @xmath411 , we effectively have a new value for the constant of proportionality which was once held by @xmath101 .",
    "if we define @xmath412 and set @xmath413 then we have @xmath414 this is the unique killing vector which is both proportional to the null generators on the horizon and which satisfies on the horizon .",
    "( if the horizon is degenerate this vector will not exist since the killing vectors tangent to the horizon have @xmath415 and @xmath416 in this case . )",
    "since @xmath404 is a killing vector , we can choose a system of adapted coordinates @xmath417 where @xmath418 .",

    "the advantage of using this as the volume of stationary black holes is that the choice of vector @xmath425 relies only on local parameters , rather than , as with the canonical black hole volume , requiring asymptotic flatness or a kerr - schild form .",
    "the relationship between the volume generated by @xmath404 and the canonical black hole volume can be found by using . with the help of ( [ cvhw ] )",
    "we find that for a region @xmath228 @xmath426 in agreement with ( [ firstkappa ] ) .",
    "this allows us to give a new definition for the surface gravity @xmath101 in terms of the ratio of these volumes : @xmath427 where the second equality makes explicit that the surface gravity is the ratio of the canonical and null - generator volumes . in the special case where the spacetime is a kerr - schild spacetime with a flat background and @xmath319 , then @xmath428 , the euclidean spatial volume , calculated in the background space",
    "we then have @xmath429    the usual physical meaning given to the surface gravity is , as explained in @xcite , `` the force required of an observer at infinity to hold a particle ( of unit mass ) stationary at the horizon . ''",

    "an important question is , can we use this to gain further insights into black hole mechanics ?",
    "the most obvious conclusion regards the third law of black hole mechanics , @xmath430 . since @xmath431 even in the degenerate case ( consider , for example , the static spherically symmetric case )",
    "we see that the third law demands that the rate of growth @xmath424 must remain finite . in order to violate the third law",
    "we need @xmath432 and since @xmath433 is finite , this requires @xmath434 in agreement with the formulation of israel @xcite .",
    "that is , in a sequence of quasi - static steps , the reduction of @xmath101 to zero would take infinite advanced time .",
    "here we further discuss the connection between the vector volume and some of the other works referenced in section [ review ] .      following the geometrical approach introduced in @xcite , and commenting here specifically on the detailed discussion in @xcite , it should be clear now that the geometric volume defined in @xcite as quoted in is equal to the canonical black hole volume and thus is an instance of the use of the more general vector volume .",
    "additionally , they noted the relationship which is a higher - dimensional generalization of .",
    "of particular interest is the modified smarr - gibbs - duhem relation ( [ sgd ] ) and the thermodynamic volume relation ( [ vthermo ] ) . these results involve integrals over an infinite @xmath22-surface with modifications to remove the contribution from @xmath13 to the @xmath54 and @xmath435 integrals .",
    "in particular , @xmath436 is eventually derived as an integral over a 2-surface of the killing potential for @xmath437 , the killing vector proportional to the null generators on the horizon .    in order to demonstrate how the vector volume enters into ( [ sgd ] ) in a somewhat natural way",
    ", we demonstrate a somewhat similar relation , modified in such a way as to focus on the vector volume .",
    "the derivation here largely follows @xcite .    for a hypersurface @xmath95 with boundary @xmath58 , one form of gauss theorem relating to an antisymmetric tensor @xmath438",

    "the komar formulae integrated over @xmath444 diverge and so some method to subtract out the charge contribution would need to be introduced .      since the kodama vector from section [ haywardkodama ] has a zero expansion in spherical symmetry , hayward s kodama volume , wherein @xmath81 is orthogonal to the boundaries of @xmath95 , is clearly , in the case of spherical symmetry , a vector volume .",
    "if we write the metric for dynamic spherical symmetry in the form , then @xmath286 , which explains in some measure why the kodama volume for the region @xmath493 is equal to the euclidean volume of a sphere of @xmath494 .",

    "and hayward involve the use of specific instances of the vector volume .",
    "in addition to these , we proposed a null generator volume for non - degenerate stationary black holes .",
    "this volume has the advantage that it depends on neither the asymptotic properties of the spacetime nor the background metric in kerr - schild type spacetimes . combining the canonical black hole volume and null generator volume ,",
    "both of which are special cases of the vector volume , we have arrived at a new definition of the surface gravity .",

    "if there exist coordinates @xmath512 on the manifold , then an @xmath501-form @xmath219 defined on the manifold can be written in the form @xmath513 , where the wedge symbol denotes a totally antisymmetric product and @xmath51 is a scalar .",
    "the integral of @xmath219 is then defined as @xmath514 or the integral of the scalar over the product of the differentials .",
    "the manifold over which @xmath510 is defined is the hypersurface @xmath124 , and we can use coordinates @xmath515 for the @xmath18-dimensional hypersurface . in these coordinates , we can write @xmath516 so that @xmath517 and we recover . @xmath518 , as the interior product of the vector field @xmath6 with the volume form @xmath495 , has a very clear interpretation , which is the advantage of presentation given in this appendix .",
    "we can now show that the reason for the invariance of @xmath117 , under the choice of @xmath124 , is because the contribution of the `` vector volume element '' from each individual integral curve of @xmath6 is the same regardless of its position along the curve . to demonstrate this",
    ", we take the lie derivative @xmath519 of the vector volume element along the vector field @xmath6 , in its formulation as a @xmath18-form @xmath510 .",
    "this gives @xmath520 where @xmath521 is the divergence of @xmath6 .",
    "( we show that @xmath522 in appendix [ lieproof ] . )",
    "this demonstrates that the vector volume element contribution from each integral curve is independent of position along the curve if and only if vector field be divergence - free .",
    "this definition emphasizes that the total vector field volume can be interpreted as the riemann sum of contributions @xmath497 from each individual integral curve of @xmath6 , and the result shows that @xmath497 is constant along each integral curve .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath117 is independent of the choice of hypersurface .",
    "we wish to prove that @xmath523 as required by ( [ liev ] ) .",
    "we start with cartan s identity which states that @xmath524 for vector @xmath502 , differential form @xmath525 , and exterior derivative @xmath526 .",

    "we have @xmath529 with @xmath530 since @xmath531 for any differential form @xmath525 .",
    "further , we can write @xmath532 by applying cartan s identity again .",
    "the @xmath533 term becomes zero when the interior product @xmath534 is taken with it . as a result ,",
    "we can write @xmath535 now from the definition of divergence we have @xmath536 and so @xmath537 since the interior product is the contraction of a form with the vector field , the scalar @xmath538 can be brought outside the interior product and we arrive at ( [ bb ] ) as required .",
