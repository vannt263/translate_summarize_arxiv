    "the number of intersecting haloes in the two cases are comparable , even though the number density of haloes is larger in the former case ( figure  3 ) .",
    "this is because the number of intersecting haloes scales as @xmath99 ( eq  [ eq : numz ] ) , which puts higher weights on haloes of larger mass as compared to the distribution shown in figure  3 .",
