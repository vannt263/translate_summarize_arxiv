    "the very high luminosity of this quasar ( @xmath14 ) suggests that it contains a black - hole mass of at least several billion solar masses .",
    "we have obtained near - infrared spectroscopy of sdss j1148 + 5251 to search for the mgii emission line ( rest wavelength 2799 ) redshifted into the @xmath1-band .",
    "this line is particularly useful since it is usually found close to the systemic redshift , unlike higher ionization lines such as civ which typically show large blueshifts @xmath15 kms@xmath4 ( richards et al .",
    "the redshift for this quasar given by fan et al . was based on the position of a heavily absorbed ly@xmath6 line and the onset of the lyman break and is therefore quite uncertain .",
    "an accurate redshift is important for determining the strength of the proximity effect and for molecular line searches .",
    "additionally , it has recently been shown that the width of the mgii emission line can be used to derive the mass of the quasars central black hole in the same way that the h@xmath16 line has traditionally been used ( mclure & jarvis 2002 ) .",
    "we describe the spectroscopic observations and measurements made from them in  2 .",
    "the importance of the new redshift determination is discussed in  3 .",
    "we determine an estimate for the mass of the black hole in  4 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "we observed sdss j1148 + 5251 with the united kingdom infra - red telescope ( ukirt ) equipped with the ukirt imager spectrometer ( uist ) on 2003 january 10 .",
    "uist is a 1 - 5 @xmath17 m imager - spectrometer with a 1024x1024 insb array .",
    "conditions were photometric with seeing at @xmath1-band approximately 0.6 arcsec .",
    "the @xmath18 grism was employed with a 0.48 arcsec wide slit giving continuous wavelength coverage from 1.4 to 2.5 microns with a resolving power of @xmath19 .",
    "the pixels have size 10.9   spectrally and 0.12 arcsec spatially .",
    "the target was nodded along the slit a distance of 12 arcsec in between exposures to enable accurate sky subtraction .",
    "the total integration time of the observation was 6480 seconds .",
    "the data frames were flat - fielded and then adjacent pairs were subtracted from each other to subtract the sky emission and produce positive and negative spectra of the target .",
    "these data were combined and any pixels deviating from the mean at the @xmath20 level were excluded since this indicates contamination by cosmic rays . the residual background level was subtracted from the combined image .",
    "the positive and negative quasar spectra were extracted from this image using apertures of 1.0 arcsec and combined .",
    "flux calibration and atmospheric extinction corrections were made by dividing the spectrum by that of a star of spectral type f6 which was observed immediately preceding the quasar .",
    "an accurate wavelength calibration was made by comparison to an argon arc lamp .",
    "this solution was then checked against the positions of about 20 sky emission lines giving an rms uncertainty in the wavelength calibration of 1 .",
    "the absolute flux scale of the spectrum was set by comparison with the magnitude measured in a snapshot @xmath1-band image .",
    "the image gave @xmath21 consistent with the @xmath22 quoted by fan et al .",

    "the spectrum of sdss j1148 + 5251 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "it shows a broad emission line at approximately the position expected for redshifted mgii . to determine the wavelength and width of the mgii emission line , a line - fitting process was applied which involves the determination of the underlying continuum and feii emission surrounding the mgii line . due to the blending of the mgii line emission and the feii features in the 2700   2900region",
    ", the fitting of the continuum and feii emission is confined to two bands either side of the mgii line ( rest - frame 2250   2700  and 2900   3100 ) .",
    "the feii emission in this spectral region is modeled using an feii template based on an archival hst fos spectrum of the narrow line seyfert galaxy izw1 , which is notable for its extremely strong feii emission . due to the fact that the feii emission in izw1 is relatively narrow ( fwhm @xmath23 kms@xmath4 )",
    ", this template can be smoothed in order to match the much broader feii features typical of powerful quasars .",
    "the fitting of the feii emission template and agn continuum are performed simultaneously , with the amplitude and fwhm of the feii iron template left as free parameters .",
    "the agn continuum is modeled as a power law which is normalized with the continuum magnitude at rest - frame 1280  of @xmath24 given by fan et al .",
    "the spectral index of the power law is a free parameter and the fitting produces a value of @xmath25 ( defining @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the flux - density at frequency @xmath28 ) .",
    "this continuum slope is typical of quasars ( e.g. vanden berk et al .",
    "the goodness of fit for the feii+continuum fit is determined from a chi - square test using the noise array from the observation .",
    "once the minimum chi - square fit has been determined the best - fitting combination of continuum and feii emission is then subtracted from the spectrum , leaving the isolated mgii emission line in the region 2700   2900 .",
    "the mgii emission line itself is then modeled using two identical gaussians which represent the line doublet ( @xmath29 ) . during the fitting of the line profile ,",
    "the amplitude , fwhm and central wavelength of the gaussians are treated as free parameters , while the doublet separation is held fixed at its laboratory value .",
    "the best fit to the mgii emission was determined with a chi - square test .",
    "although more complex deconvolutions of the line profile are obviously possible , due to the signal - to - noise constraints of the spectrum the above procedure was adopted because it was able to effectively describe the mgii line profile with the minimum level of complexity .",
    "we also performed an alternative fitting procedure in which the continuum was fixed at two points with low expected feii emission and then the mgii and feii features fit simultaneously .",
    "the results from this independent fitting method are consistent with those using the former method .",
    "the ratio of feii / mgii emission lines in high redshift quasars is a powerful diagnostic of early element production inside supernovae ( yoshii , tsujimoto & kawara 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately we do not have sufficient signal to noise to place meaningful constraints on this ratio using either of our two fitting methods .",
    "the best fit mgii line doublet in sdss j1148 + 5251 is at a redshift of @xmath5 .",
    "the deconvolved fwhm of each component of the doublet is @xmath30 kms@xmath4 .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width of the mgii line is 35 .",
    "the typical equivalent width of mgii lines in lower redshift sdss quasars is 32(vanden berk et al .",
    "the fact that the equivalent width of mgii in sdss j1148 + 5251 is similar to that of other quasars indicates that the uv continuum emission from this quasar is not strongly beamed .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) noted that the ly@xmath6 equivalent width of this and other @xmath31 quasars are smaller than lower redshift quasars .",
    "pentericci et al .",
    "( 2002 ) observed the civ line in the @xmath32 quasar sdss j1030 + 0524 and also found an equivalent width typical of lower redshift quasars .",
    "these results suggest that the low ly@xmath6 equivalent widths are primarily due to ly@xmath6 absorption and not a fundamental difference between the emission properties of these quasars .",
    "the redshift of @xmath33 for this quasar given in fan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is based on the position of the heavily absorbed ly@xmath6 line and the onset of the lyman break .",
    "the lack of distinguishable nv emission or any other lines in the optical spectrum mean that a more accurate redshift could not be obtained .",
    "in our spectrum we are able to measure the location of the mgii line and hence obtain a more accurate redshift for this quasar .",
    "we find a redshift of @xmath34 .",
    "the mgii line is particularly useful for redshift estimation compared to , for example , civ which could be observed in the @xmath35-band .",
    "the low - ionization mgii line is usually found close to the systemic redshift , whereas the high - ionization civ line often shows blueshifts of several thousand kms@xmath4 ( richards et al . 2002 ) .",
    "another important fact is that there is no systematic velocity offset for the ly@xmath6 and mgii lines in a large sample of sdss quasars ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) , so we can predict the intrinsic , unabsorbed ly@xmath6 line peak .",
    "accurate redshifts for the most distant quasars are important for several reasons .",
    "the rest - frame uv spectra of @xmath36 quasars show a deficit of flux shortward of ly@xmath6 due to absorption by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( fan et al . 2001 ; becker et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these observations have led to the possibility that we are now witnessing the epoch of reionization . whilst accurate quasar redshifts are not essential for determining the ionization state of the universe as a function of redshift",
    ", they are very important when dealing with the state of the igm close to the quasar .    assuming that the igm in general is neutral at the redshift of the quasar",
    ", the strong ionizing field of the quasar will ionize a local region around the quasar allowing ly@xmath6 photons to be transmitted .",
    "proximity effect _ has been observed as a lack of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars close to the peak of ly@xmath6 ( bajtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ) .",
    "cen & haiman ( 2000 ) showed that the size of this ionized region and the transmitted flux blueward of the peak of ly@xmath6 depend upon the number of ionizing photons which have been emitted from the quasar , i.e. the product of its lifetime and luminosity .",
    "haiman & cen ( 2002 ) apply this to the spectrum of the @xmath32 quasar sdss j1030 + 0524 to show that it is not strongly gravitationally lensed and to derive a lower limit on how long the quasar has been active .",
    "such an analysis depends critically on knowing where the peak of the ly@xmath6 line should be in the spectrum .    the spectrum of sdss j1148 + 5251 presented by fan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also shows zero flux at ly@xmath6 redshifts of 5.7 to 6.33 , suggestive of a neutral universe .",
    "however , there is some flux apparent on the blue wing of ly@xmath6 which is likely due to the proximity effect .",
    "the marked location of ly@xmath6 at @xmath10 given by fan et al .",
    "is at the peak of the ly@xmath6 emission .",
    "however , adopting the new redshift for the quasar of @xmath2 shifts the location of ly@xmath6 to 9010 , which is co - incident with a steep decline in flux to less than half of the peak value .",
    "hence the revised redshift indicates a substantially more neutral igm close to the quasar .",
    "the amount and extent of transmitted flux on the blue side of ly@xmath6 is similar to that in sdss j1030 + 0524 and the conclusions about this quasar made by haiman & cen ( 2002 ) and pentericci et al .",
    "( 2002 ) probably apply equally to sdss j1148 + 5251 .",
    "the evolutionary state of the host galaxies of high redshift quasars can be probed by ( sub)millimeter observations of dust and molecular gas .",
    "particularly important tracers are the emission lines from transitions of co molecules and carbon atoms ( blain et al .",
    "however current millimeter receivers have a fairly small bandwidth corresponding to @xmath37 kms@xmath4 .",
    "hence systemic redshifts must be known to an accuracy of @xmath38 to ensure that the emission line will fall within the frequency range of the observation .",
    "our observations of sdss j1148 + 5251 provide a redshift of sufficient accuracy for millimeter line searches .",
    "reverberation mapping studies of low redshift quasars have been successfully employed to estimate the masses of their black holes ( netzer & peterson 1997 ) .",
    "this method determines the radial distance of the broad line emitting region ( blr ) from the nucleus ( @xmath39 ) , by observing the time lag ( @xmath40 year ) between variations in the uv / optical continuum and the line strength .",
    "combining this distance with the velocity of the emission line gas ( @xmath41 , which is closely related to the observed fwhm of the line ) gives a virial estimate of the black - hole mass ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this estimate assumes that the dynamics of the gas are dominated by gravitational forces ( see peterson & wandel 2000 for a discussion ) .",
    "these reverberation studies have revealed a correlation between the continuum luminosity and the radius of the blr which can be used to estimate black - hole masses when only the line fwhm and luminosity are available ( kaspi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "traditionally , the h@xmath16 emission line has been used for this work , since it is readily observable in the optical spectra of low redshift quasars where the reverberation mapping calibration of luminosity and blr has been derived .",
    "recently , mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) have cross - calibrated this relationship from the h@xmath16 line to the mgii line using a sample of agn with reverberation mapping measures of @xmath43 , so that black - hole mass estimates can be derived to higher redshifts .",
    "they note that the mgii line ( which has an ionization potential close to that of h@xmath16 ) is a much better choice than higher ionization lines like civ whose dynamics may be strongly influenced by outflows .",
    "mclure & jarvis derived a calibration between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( the monochromatic luminosity at 3000 ) and performed a fit to the h@xmath16 and mgii fwhms , finding a linear relationship with virtually identical normalization .",
    "the resulting black - hole mass estimator has the form    @xmath45    our spectrum covers the rest wavelength region 3000  and we have determined the mgii fwhm .",
    "therefore we can apply this formula to derive an estimate of the black - hole mass in sdss j1148 + 5251 . using @xmath46 w and fwhm(mgii )",
    "= 6000 kms@xmath4 we get @xmath47 .",
    "assuming that @xmath31 quasars are not fundamentally different to low redshift quasars ( evidence supporting this is that their spectra are similar ) , the accuracy of this black - hole mass estimator with respect to those from reverberation mapping is a factor of 2.5 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this is an extremely massive black hole to be in existence such a short time ( 840 myr ) after the beginning of the universe . assuming that this black hole is residing in a proportionately massive halo ( @xmath49 ) then standard theories of structure formation",
    "predict that this is one of the rarest , most massive halos to have collapsed by this time ( e.g. haiman & loeb 2001 ; fan et al .",
    "there are two caveats to the derived black - hole mass . since the estimator depends on @xmath50 ,",
    "if we have over - estimated the intrinsic , isotropic luminosity we will have over - estimated the black hole mass . if the luminosity function of @xmath36 quasars has a steep slope then there are expectations that a significant fraction of the sdss @xmath36 quasars will have their luminosities enhanced by either gravitational lensing or beaming ( turner 1991 ; wyithe & loeb 2002a ) . fan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discussed @xmath1-band images of the three new @xmath36 quasars and found that none of them show evidence for gravitational lensing .",
    "our spectrum found that the equivalent width of the mgii line is typical of quasars which shows that the continuum luminosity is not strongly enhanced by beaming .",
    "therefore , the available evidence suggests that there is minimal amplification of the intrinsic quasar luminosity .",
    "it is interesting to consider the maximum luminosity that can be attained by an accreting black hole of this mass .",
    "this is usually considered to be the eddington limit at which the outward radiation pressure equals the inward gravitational attraction .",
    "the eddington limit for a black hole of mass @xmath51 is @xmath52 w. using a bolometric correction of 7 to get the bolometric luminosity from @xmath53 ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) we determine a bolometric luminosity for sdss j1148 + 5251 of @xmath54 w. therefore we find that the black hole in this quasar is radiating the maximal amount possible .",
    "this supports the often made assumption when relating quasar luminosities to black hole and halo masses that the highest redshift quasars are accreting at the eddington limit ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2001 ; wyithe & loeb 2002b ) .",
    "it is not too surprising to find that sdss j1148 + 5251 has the minimum size black hole given its luminosity . as mentioned above",
    ", the short cosmic time available for the growth of supermassive black holes by this redshift means black holes with such masses will only have arisen within rare collapsed peaks . in such conditions , there is likely to be a plentiful gas supply to fuel the quasar and the black hole is expected to be accreting close to its eddington limit .",
    "we have presented @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra of the quasar sdss j1148 + 5251 which currently has the highest known redshift .",
    "we clearly detect the broad mgii emission line . fitting the location of this emission line",
    "we derive a redshift of @xmath5 .",
    "the equivalent width of this line is similar to that of lower redshift sdss quasars , suggesting that the optical continuum is not strongly beamed .",
    "we obtain a virial estimate of the black - hole mass of @xmath55 .",
    "the quasar is radiating at the eddington luminosity , in line with the expectation that it is easier to fuel a supermassive black hole than create one at such an early epoch .",
    "similar observations of other @xmath9 quasars would reveal if they are all radiating at the eddington luminosity .",
