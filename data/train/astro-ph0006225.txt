    "high redshift quasars are of interest not only for their ` record setting ' quality , but also because they can tell us about the formation of quasars and about conditions in the universe at early times ( turner 1991 , hamann & ferland 1994 )",

    "these properties differentiate high z quasars from typical low redshift seyfert galaxies which have strong iron k - lines ( ew=100 - 300 ev ) , and a strong compton hump that requires half the sky ( as seen from the x - ray source ) to be covered with compton - thick ` cold ' material ( @xmath15=1 , nandra & pounds 1994 and references therein ) .",

    "( with exposures of 39,439  s and 17,862  s respectively . )",
    "unexpectedly , the co - aligned phoswich detector system ( pds , frontera et al . , 1997 ) also detected a clear signal in its 15 - 100  kev bandpass of 0.26@xmath25  ct / s ( in an effective on - source exposure time of 16,676  s ) .",
    "standard data reduction was performed using the saxdas software package ( 1997 ) .",
    "in particular , data are linearized and cleaned from earth occultation periods and unwanted periods of high particle background ( due to satellite passages through the south atlantic anomaly , saa ) .",
    "data from mecs units 2 and 3 were combined after gain equalization ( unit 1 has been inoperative since 1997 may 7 ) .",
    "the mecs and lecs pulse height spectra of pks2149@xmath0306 were extracted using 3  arcmin and 8  arcmin radius extraction regions , respectively .",
    "these radii maximize the signal - to - noise ratio below 1 kev in the lecs and above 2 kev in the mecs .",
    "background was taken from high galactic latitude blank fields using the same extraction regions as for the source regions .",
    "although background is negligible for this source , we checked that the level of the background in regions surrounding the source is within 10% of that recorded in the same regions in the blank fields .",
    "for the pds the problem of accurate background subtraction is crucial since the pds is a non - imaging detector .",
    "the pds uses rocking collimators , one for each of two pairs of detectors , that switch positions quickly every 92  s so that one of the pairs is always pointed at the source , while the other is monitoring the background .",
    "the spectra from the four pds crystals were summed together .",
    "the net source spectrum was then obtained by subtracting the ` off - source ' background from the ` on - source ' counts , scaling by the exposure time .",
    "the background in the equatorial bepposax orbit varies by only @xmath810 - 20% , thanks to shielding by the earth s particle belts ( this was the main reason for selecting an equatorial orbit for bepposax ) , and has an active anti - coincidence csi(na ) particle shield ( which is also used to detect gamma - ray bursts , frontera et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the main background variations are recorded just after the passages through the saa .",
    "( the instrument is switched off while in the saa ) .",
    "the first five minutes after saa passages are excluded from the data analysis to allow an automatic gain control system to return the high voltages to their normal working value .",
    "this system keeps the pulse - height to energy scale constant to 1% . using the rocking technique it is possible to take into account accurately the residual background variations .",
    "the magnitude of residual systematic errors in pds spectra have been evaluated by guainazzi and matteuzzi ( 1997 ) at @xmath26 counts s@xmath19 , using deep observations of blank fields .",
    "even if this maximum residual is subracted from the observed count rate , the signal to noise in this observation would remain @xmath27 .",
    "the source is detected at @xmath28 up to 40 - 50 kev , which is about 150 kev in the quasar rest frame .",
    "the chance of finding a source in any given 2  sq.degree , the fwhm beam area of the pds , is small .",
    "the heao-1 a4 all sky catalog ( levine et al . , 1984 ) lists just 7 high galactic latitude ( @xmath29 ) sources in the 13 - 80  kev band , which is closely comparable to the pds band , down to a flux of 2@xmath3010@xmath31erg  @xmath32  s@xmath19 ( 10mcrab ) .",
    "the pks2149@xmath0306 signal is 7.5 times fainter so , assuming a logn - logs slope of @xmath01.5 , we expect a chance coincidence rate of 1.4% , hence we believe the pds signal does come from pks2149306 . our confidence in the identification of the pds signal with pks2149@xmath0306 is increased further by the agreement to better than 10% of the normalizations of the pds and mecs spectra and the similarity of their slopes ( see next section ) .",
    "the egret source reported later is too far away to produce the pds signal ( see  4 ) .",
    "spectral fits were performed using the xspec  10.0 software package and versions of the response matrices made public on 1997 august 31 .",
    "pi channels in mecs and lecs spectra are rebinned sampling the instrument resolution with the same number of channels at all energies and ensuring at least 20 counts per bin for the other .",
    "this guarantees the applicability of the @xmath33 method in determining the best fit parameters , since the distribution in each channel can be considered gaussian .",
    "constant factors have been introduced in the model fitting in order to take into account the intercalibration systematics between instruments ( _ bepposax cookbook _ , fiore et al .",
    "if we use the two mecs as reference instruments , then the lecs and pds normalizations lie in the ranges 0.7 - 1.0 and 0.80 - 0.95 relative to the mecs , respectively .",
    "the ( observed frame ) energy ranges used for the fits are : 0.1 - 4 kev for the lecs , 1.65 - 10.5 kev for the mecs , and 14 - 130 kev for the pds .",

    "quasar frame values are given in the text where appropriate .",
    "errors in table 1 are 90 % confidence intervals for 1 interesting parameter .",
    "a simple power - law plus absorption model gives a reasonably good fit ( figure  1 , table  1 ) , but with systematic deviations at low energies .",
    "pks2149306 appears to have faded slightly over the three years between the obsevations : the 2 - 10 kev bepposax flux , using the simple power law fit , is ( @xmath34 , 80% of the flux recorded in the 1994 october asca observation ( @xmath35 , cappi et al 1997 ) ; and the monochromatic 2 kev bepposax flux is ( @xmath36  kev@xmath19 , 76% of the 1990/1991 rosat rass detection at ( @xmath37  kev@xmath19 ( schartel et al .",

    "the lecs shows a clear excess of counts below about 1  kev .",
    "this soft excess seems in contradiction with the above galactic n@xmath38 reported by yaqoob et al .",
    "while variability in the 11  months ( quasar frame ) between the two observations is possible , we also note that the low energy calibration of asca is uncertain , and we have more confidence in the beppo - sax value ( parmar et al . , 1997 , mineo et al . , 2000",
    "the presence of a low energy excess means that the x - ray spectrum can not give a reliable galactic absorption value , so we fix the absorbing column to the galactic 21  cm value ( 2.2@xmath3010@xmath39@xmath32 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",

    "therein ) .    a better fit can be had with a broken power - law to account for the slight upturn in the lecs spectrum below @xmath81  kev ( table 1 ) . in this case",
    "the steeper low energy slope is @xmath42 allowing the absorbing column to be free to vary , or @xmath43 fixing @xmath44 to its galactic value .",
    "both slopes are consistent with the rosat rass value of @xmath45 ( schartel et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the break energy is about 0.8 kev ( observed frame , 2.7  kev quasar frame ) in both cases .",
    "the high energy index is indistinguishable from the single power law index .",
    "an apparent soft excess can also be generated though an absorption edge . in the quasar frame",
    "there is no sign of an ionized oxygen absorber , although at @xmath46 the energy of the deepest edges usually seen in low luminosity seyfert galaxies ( ovii and oviii ) fall at 0.22 and 0.26 kev ( observer frame ) respectively , close to the carbon edge ( 0.283 kev ) produced by the lecs window , and are therefore affected by large systematic errors .",
    "a fit with an absorption edge and a single power law ( table  1 ) gives a good @xmath33 .",

    "this cooling makes inverse compton losses dominate over synchrotron losses making the radio spectrum weak relative to the x - ray , so creating a ` compton dominant ' sed .",
    "pks2149306 seems to have a large ` optical / uv big bump ' , as expected in this model .",
    "such large optical / uv big bumps are unusual , but not unprecedented in fsrq ( e.g. 3c273 , elvis et al . , 1994c ) .",
    "an illustrative accretion disk spectrum , that roughly fits the big bump , is shown in figure  2 ( @xmath91 , @xmath92=0.1 , from the tabulation given in siemiginowska et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray excess in pks  2149306 appears unusually strong ( figure  2 ) .",
    "we noted in ",
    "[ fits ] that an absorption edge imprinted onto a single power law gives an equally good fit . since ionized absorbers of the kind that could produce such an edge are common in agn and blazars we must consider this interpretation on an equal footing with a ` soft excess ' component .",
    "an absorption edge can be more tightly constrained than a soft excess .",
    "a local z@xmath80 absorber is unlikely since no molecular cloud is nearby ( marscher 1988 , turner et al . , 1995 ) , nor is any low z galaxy seen on the stsci digitization of the sky surveys .",
    "an absorber associated with the quasar is more likely , x - ray absorption with a similar column density is common in radio - loud high redshift quasars ( elvis et al . , 1994a , cappi et al . , 1997 , fiore et al .",
    ", 1998a , elvis et al . , 1998 ) , and there is evidence for high ionization oxygen absorbers of similar column density in some low redshift blazars ( canizares & kruper 1984 , koenigl et al .",
    "1995 , sambruna et al .",
    "1997 , grandi et al .",

    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "to produce an apparent @xmath93=0 absorber would require a coincidence of outflow velocity and cosmological redshift . a substantial ejection velocity , @xmath94 ,",
    "is implied . in pks",
    "2155304 the absorber has a suggested velocity of @xmath95 relative to the core ( canizares & kruper 1984 ) so a high ejection velocity in pks  2149306 is not inconceivable .",
    "@xmath94 is larger than the @xmath96 seen in broad absorption line quasars ( turnshek 1988 ) ; it is much slower , though , than the velocities needed to explain superluminal radio sources ( zenzus 1997 ) , although these may be pattern speeds rather than true expansion velocities",

    "we have detected the z=2.34 quasar pks2149@xmath0306 up to 150  kev in its rest frame , using the pds on bepposax .",
    "this is some 4 times higher in energy than any other z@xmath131 quasar , except for the egret blazars .",
    "pks  2149 - 306 is also an order of magnitude x - ray loud relative to the optical ( @xmath88=0.81 ) .",
    "the @xmath133  kev spectrum of pks  2149306 , as for several other high redshift radio - loud quasars , is extremely hard ( @xmath97 , kt=46@xmath98  kev , observed frame ) , comparable to the x - ray background spectrum .",
    "the pks2149@xmath0306 sed seems to show the two peaks typical of bl  lacertae objects , suggesting that the x - ray 1 - 100 kev observed emission is dominated by an inverse compton component .",
    "unusually the sed is strongly dominated by the @xmath24-ray peak . a strong ` big bump ' in the optical",
    "/ ultraviolet seems to be present in pks2149306 .",
    "possibly , as suggested by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this bump is the source of the photons that cool the jet , suppressing the radio emission and creating the compton dominated spectrum .",
    "this makes pks2149@xmath0306 an extreme example of the luminosity based one - parameter unification scheme of ghisellini et al ..    the low energy x - ray spectrum of pks  2149306 shows no absorption above the galactic value , contrary to the asca 1994 data ( yaqoob et al .",
    "1999 ) , showing instead a soft excess .",
    "an absorption edge fits the data as well as a broken power - law .",
    "one interpretation of an absorption edge is an oxygen absorber with n@xmath9910@xmath100@xmath32 , blueshifted from the quasar redshift and implying an ejection velocity , @xmath101 .",
    "such an absorber would provide a link with absorbers in other high redshift quasars , and with the absorbers in some low z blazars .",
