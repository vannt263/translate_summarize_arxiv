    "if the system is perturbed at some instant of time @xmath0 and evolve unitarily afterwards , it is natural to ask whether there exists any time scale when its subsystems become uncorrelated .",
    "since the mutual information @xmath7 between two such subsystems @xmath8 and @xmath9 provides an upper bound for the connected two - point functions of operators acting on these subsystems @xcite @xmath10 it is natural to study the vanishing of this quantity to answer this question .",
    "the study of the time dependence in this measure of entanglement can help us to understand the time scales controlling how quantum systems get thermalized , which is one of the most important problems in non - equilibrium physics .",
    "a particular situation of the above scenario is when a perturbation acts on a thermal state . in holographic theories ,",
    "thermal states are believed to have a gravity dual in terms of black holes @xcite .",
    "black hole physics suggests that the speed at which the system forgets initial conditions , i.e. the perturbation , is the fastest among all physical diffusive processes .",
    "this gave rise to the notion of fast scramblers and the scrambling conjecture @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide a first principle derivation for the time scale at which this phenomenon occurs for 2d cfts in the large @xmath1 limit in a concrete setup which allows both cft and holographic computations .",
    "recently , shenker and stanford considered an excellent and tractable setup to study the fast scrambling phenomena in the context of an eternal black hole @xcite .",
    "this involves a pair of non - interacting cfts in an entangled state , the thermofield double state .",
    "tracing any entire cft hilbert space , gives rise to a thermal density matrix in the remaining cft .",
    "the perturbation is described by some boundary cft operator and its gravity dual involved a shock - wave propagating in the black hole background .",
    "no matter how small the boundary perturbation is , the blue shift of energies when this perturbation reaches the horizon suggests the existence of a non - trivial backreaction .",
    "in this work , we study such a setup for a perturbation localized in a point - like region , triggered by a primary operator in a given cft . to obtain analytical results , we consider 2d large @xmath1 cfts and their gravity duals given by a perturbation of the btz black hole @xcite .",
    "recent developments in the calculation of 4-pt functions involving heavy and light operators in the large @xmath1 limit of the dual 2d cft @xcite ( see also @xcite ) allow us to analytically test these ideas",

    "entanglement entropy and mutual information at finite temperature cfts has been analyzed for integral cfts in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the holographic calculations of time - evolutions of entanglement entropy after local perturbations have been analyzed in @xcite at zero temperature and in @xcite at finite temperature . in this paper",

    "when both subsystems @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the intervals @xmath17 and the perturbation is turned on at @xmath18 and time @xmath19 , we obtain the following analytical result for @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inverse temperature and @xmath23 carries the information about the primary operator perturbation of conformal dimension @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 represents a uv cut off for the local excitation , so that the excited state is localized around a region of size @xmath26 of the operator insertion .",
    "this makes the energy of the perturbation @xmath27 finite . in the limit @xmath28 , which is the relevant one to match the butterfly effect discussed in @xcite , this reduces to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the entropy density of the original thermal system .",
    "the @xmath31 behavior in is consistent with the fast scrambling conjecture @xcite .",
    "given the bound , it should be possible to extract the same time scale from the condition of vanishing two sided 2-pt functions .",
    "we explicitly show this in appendix [ ap - c ] , confirming the observation made in shenker and stanford @xcite that both scales are controlled by the same physics .",
    "in the second part of this work , we derive the same time scale from bulk holographic considerations and find a _ perfect matching _ between both calculations . our holographic model is based on the description of the local boundary perturbation in terms of some free falling particle satisfying an initial condition guaranteeing such particle carries the right amount of energy from the cft stress tensor perspective .",
    "this is done by generalizing the model in @xcite to the two sided btz black hole , based on the back reaction description of point particles as quotients of ads@xmath32 . applying the holographic entanglement entropy @xcite to evaluate the entanglement entropy and mutual information in our set - up , leads to the same scrambling time .",
    "at the same time , our setup and calculation may be useful for the interesting question regarding the dual cft interpretation of a particle falling into a ads black hole in future studies .",
    "our local boundary perturbation includes a regularization parameter @xmath25 describing its size .",
    "this parameter is holographically interpreted as the bulk position ( distance from the boundary ) from which the massive particle falls into the black hole .",
