    "time - delayed feedback control has been used as a method of stabilizing unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) or spatially extended patterns by a number of authors .",
    "the method of pyragus  @xcite , sometimes called ` time - delayed autosynchronization ' ( tdas ) , has attracted much attention . here , the feedback @xmath0 is proportional to the difference between the current and a past state of the system .",
    "that is , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is some state vector , @xmath3 is the period of the targeted upo and @xmath4 is a feedback gain matrix .",
    "advantages of this method include the following .",
    "first , since the feedback vanishes on any orbit with period @xmath3 , the targeted upo is still a solution of the system with feedback .",
    "control is therefore achieved in a non - invasive manner .",
    "second , the only information required a priori is the period @xmath3 of the target upo , rather than a detailed knowledge of the profile of the orbit , or even any knowledge of the form of the original odes , which may be useful in experimental setups .",
    "the method has been implemented successfully in a variety of laboratory experiments on electronic @xcite , laser @xcite , plasma @xcite , and chemical  @xcite systems , as well as in pattern - forming systems  @xcite ; more examples can be found in a recent review by pyragus  @xcite .",
    "a paper of nakajima  @xcite gave a supposed restriction on the method of pyragus .",
    "it was believed that if a upo in a system with no feedback had an odd number of real floquet multipliers greater than unity , then there was no choice of the feedback gain matrix @xmath4 for which the method of pyragus could be used to stabilize the upo . however , a recent paper of fiedler  _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite gives a counterexample to this restriction .",
    "they add pyragus - type feedback to the normal form of a subcritical hopf bifurcation and show that the subcritical periodic orbit can be stabilized for some values of the feedback gain matrix .",
    "the hopf normal form is two - dimensional , so the subcritical orbit has exactly one unstable floquet multiplier .",
    "the mechanism for stabilizing the orbit is through a transcritical bifurcation with a stable delay - induced periodic orbit .",
    "just  _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite investigate a series of bifurcations in this system , which has the attractive feature that , despite the presence of the delay terms , much of the analysis can be carried out analytically .",
    "the subcritical hopf bifurcation of a stable equilibrium is a generic mechanism for creating upos with an odd number of unstable floquet multipliers .",
    "such bifurcations occur in a number of physical systems , such as the belousov ",
    "zhabotinsky reaction - diffusion equation  @xcite , the hodgkin ",
    "huxley model of action potentials in neurons  @xcite , and in nmr lasers  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of these higher - dimensional dynamical systems to the two - dimensional normal form of the hopf bifurcation problem is a standard procedure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if pyragus - type feedback delay terms were added to the model odes , then these ( infinite - dimensional ) dynamical systems could likewise be reduced to the standard two - dimensional normal form in a vicinity of a hopf bifurcation  @xcite , with the parameters of the feedback control matrix @xmath4 modifying the coefficients in the normal form . despite this disconnect between center manifold reduction of delay equations to hopf normal form , and the example of fiedler  _ et al .  _",
    "in which the feedback delay terms are added directly to the hopf normal form , we find that the same stabilization mechanism of subcritical hopf orbits applies to both their example and to the one we present for the lorenz equations .",
    "specifically , we study a subcritical hopf bifurcation of a stable equilibrium in the lorenz equations  @xcite , and show that pyragus - type feedback can stabilize the subcritical periodic orbit . as in the example in  @xcite , in the absence of feedback",
    ", the bifurcating periodic orbit has exactly one real unstable floquet multiplier .",
    "it also has one stable floquet multiplier , and one floquet multiplier equal to one ( corresponding to the neutral direction along the orbit ) .",
    "the @xmath5 gain matrix multiplying the pyragus feedback terms can be chosen in many different ways .",
    "we give two examples in which we choose the structure of the gain matrix in different ways and show that they give quite different results .    in our first example",
    ", we choose the gain matrix in a manner suggested by the results in  @xcite and  @xcite : there is no feedback in the stable direction of the upo , and pyragus - type feedback in the direction of the unstable floquet multiplier , which is identical in form to the feedback in  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the problem of choosing the nine parameters in the @xmath5 gain matrix is reduced to one of making an informed choice of the two parameters employed in  @xcite .",
    "we find that the subcritical orbit can be stabilized over a wide range of values of our two bifurcation parameters : the amplitude of the feedback gain , and the usual control parameter @xmath6 in the lorenz equations .",
    "we identify a codimension - two point in the hopf normal form example , where two hopf bifurcations collide , and show that the same codimension - two point can be found in the lorenz system with this choice of feedback , and the bifurcation structure is qualitatively the same in the two cases .",
    "this codimension - two point captures the stabilization mechanism in both examples : the periodic orbits created by the two hopf bifurcations exchange stability in a transcritical bifurcation .",
    "the curve of transcritical bifurcations in our two - parameter plane emanates from the hopf - hopf codimension - two point .",
    "our second choice of the gain matrix is a real multiple of the identity .",
    "this is also a natural choice , but in contrast with our first example we show that here the subcritical orbit can not be stabilized for any parameters close to the original hopf bifurcation .",
    "our two bifurcation parameters are again the amplitude of the gain and the parameter @xmath6 in the lorenz equations .",
    "we give analytical results on the location of hopf bifurcation curves and hence deduce the stability of the periodic orbit as it bifurcates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : fied ] we review some results from fiedler  _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite and just  _ et al .  _ @xcite . in section  [ sec : lor ] we give our example system of the lorenz equations with pyragus feedback .",
    "we give two examples of the choice of gain matrix .",
    "we explain for the first example how we choose the gain matrix to stabilize the subcritical hopf orbit , and show that the bifurcation structure of this system is the same as that for the normal form system . for the second example , the gain matrix is a real multiple of the identity and we show that the subcritical orbit can not be stabilized .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] concludes .",
    "in this section we recap the results of  @xcite and identify a particular codimension - two point in the hopf normal form with delay which we will later examine for the lorenz equations with feedback .",
    "this codimension - two point acts as an organizing center for the bifurcations involved in the mechanism for stabilizing the periodic orbit",
    ".    the normal form of a subcritical hopf bifurcation with a pyragus - type delay term is : @xmath7 with @xmath8 , and parameters @xmath9 .",
    "the feedback gain @xmath10 , and the delay @xmath11 .",
    "the linear hopf frequency has been normalized to unity by an appropriate scaling of time .",
    "we consider @xmath12 as the primary bifurcation parameter .",
    "we consider only @xmath13 ; this is the case in the lorenz example .    for the system with no feedback ( i.e.  @xmath14 ) we can write @xmath15 and then @xmath16 periodic orbits exist with amplitude @xmath17 if @xmath18 , so @xmath19 and the orbits have minimal period @xmath20 .",
    "we refer to these orbits as the _ pyragus orbits _ , and it is these orbits that we wish to stabilize non - invasively by adding an appropriate feedback term ( i.e.  with @xmath21 ) .    following  @xcite and  @xcite , we define the _ pyragus curve _ @xmath22 in @xmath12-@xmath3 space , along which the feedback vanishes on the pyragus orbits : @xmath23 we plot this curve in @xmath12-@xmath3 space in figure  [ fig : thtp ] , along with curves of hopf bifurcations from the zero solution .",
    "in later sections , we set @xmath22 , as our main purpose is the non - invasive stabilization of the pyragus orbits .",
    "the zero solution of   undergoes hopf bifurcations when the characteristic equation has purely imaginary solutions .",

    "\\omega -1&=b_0[\\sin(\\beta-\\omega\\tau)-\\sin\\beta ] .",
    "\\label{eq : hf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations define the hopf curves @xmath28 , in @xmath12-@xmath3 space , parameterized by the linear frequency @xmath29 associated with the bifurcating periodic orbit .",
    "there are multiple branches to this curve , which we show in figure  [ fig : thtp](a ) , but we concentrate on the one which intersects the curve @xmath22 at @xmath30 . the solution of the characteristic equation at @xmath31 , @xmath32 has @xmath33 and corresponds to the hopf bifurcation to the pyragus orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig : thtp ] shows the possible configurations of the curves @xmath22 and @xmath28 as the parameter @xmath34 is varied .",
    "the curves typically cross in two places : at @xmath31 , and at a second location depending on @xmath34 . at @xmath35 ,",
    "the two curves are tangent at @xmath31 and only intersect once .",
    "just  _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite show that @xmath36 for simplicity , we assume @xmath37 , so we must have @xmath38 .",
    "we define a curve of hopf bifurcations @xmath39 in @xmath12-@xmath34 space by the location of the second intersection of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is a hopf bifurcation to a _ delay - induced periodic orbit _ , that is , a periodic orbit arising from the addition of the delay terms ; one for which the feedback does not vanish .",
    "we adopt the convention that a hopf bifurcation of a stable equilibrium is called ` supercritical ' ( ` subcritical ' ) if the resulting periodic orbit bifurcates into the parameter regime where it coexists with the unstable ( stable ) equilibrium .",
    "such a supercritical bifurcation generically produces a stable periodic orbit  @xcite , while the subcritical case produces an unstable periodic orbit . in the absence of feedback ,",
    "the bifurcating orbit is subcritical and unstable .",
    "the mechanism for stabilization involves the additional delay - induced hopf bifurcation at @xmath42 .",
    "this bifurcation can change the trivial equilibrium from being stable to being unstable .",
    "consequently , the pyragus orbit may then co - exist with an unstable periodic orbit . as the hopf bifurcation at @xmath42 passes through @xmath31 , the original hopf bifurcation to the pyragus orbit at @xmath31 changes from a subcritical one to a supercritical one .",
    "this is all done without otherwise altering the form of the pyragus orbit .",
    "the hopf bifurcation of the zero solution to the pyragus orbit at @xmath30 changes from subcritical to supercritical as described above as @xmath34 is increased through @xmath43 , since for @xmath44 , the curve @xmath40 lies ` inside ' @xmath41 . in this sense , @xmath43 is the smallest value of the feedback gain for which the pyragus orbit is stabilized immediately after the bifurcation point .",
    "the minimum positive @xmath43 can be selected by choosing @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",
    "we now review some of the details of the bifurcation structure of the system   which are described in just  _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , and identify the codimension - two point we examine in the lorenz system .",
    "we consider @xmath12 and @xmath34 as two bifurcation parameters , and fix @xmath22 .",
    "the mechanism by which the pyragus orbit is stabilized is through a transcritical bifurcation with a delay - induced periodic orbit . as shown in just",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , the transcritical bifurcations occur when @xmath47 or , in @xmath12-@xmath34 space , since @xmath22 , when @xmath48 this line of transcritical bifurcations collides in @xmath12-@xmath34 space with the two curves of hopf bifurcations @xmath31 and @xmath39 at @xmath49 , at a double - hopf codimension - two point .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bifs ] we sketch the bifurcation structure around this point in @xmath12-@xmath34 space . from this figure",
    "we can see that in order for the pyragus orbit to bifurcate stably ( i.e.  supercritically ) at @xmath31 , we must have @xmath44 .",
    "we now use the lorenz equations as an example system to demonstrate that the feedback described above can also stabilize orbits arising in a subcritical hopf bifurcation in a higher - dimensional system of differential equations .",
    "we give two examples of a choice of feedback gain matrix .",
    "the first choice is informed by the results given above , and for the second choice we set the gain matrix equal to a real multiple of the identity . in the first example",
    ", we further locate the codimension - two point described in section  [ sec : cod2 ] , in the lorenz system with feedback , and show that the bifurcation structure is the same as in the normal form case .",
    "the lorenz equations  @xcite are most often written in the following form : @xmath50 for real parameters",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath6 .",
    "lorenz and most other authors studied the parameter regime @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and we continue in the same manner .",
    "taking @xmath6 as the primary bifurcation parameter , the zero solution is stable for @xmath56 and loses stability in a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath57 .",
    "two further equilibria are created at @xmath58 as @xmath6 is increased further , these equilibria each undergo a subcritical hopf bifurcation at @xmath59 ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for further details ) .",
    "it is this bifurcation that we study in the following , so we shift coordinates to be centered around @xmath60 and rescale to obtain : @xmath61 figure  [ fig : sub ] shows a bifurcation diagram of the subcritical bifurcation of the zero solution of  , and also the period @xmath62 of the bifurcating orbits , which we use to determine the delay time @xmath63 in the controlled system .",
    "the periodic orbit exists for @xmath64 ; at the lower boundary it collides with a fixed point in a homoclinic bifurcation .",
    "we now add pyragus - type feedback to the lorenz equations .",
    "we write @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 , etc .  and",
    "@xmath68 is a @xmath5 real feedback gain matrix , to be determined . in this section",
    "we use the results of  @xcite and  @xcite to inform our choice of the control matrix @xmath68 . in general , @xmath68 would contain nine independent parameters , but the method we describe reduces this to only two . in section  [ sec : id_feed ]",
    "we describe the dynamics when @xmath68 is a real multiple of the identity .",
    "note that if this system were reduced to normal form around the hopf bifurcation point , the resulting equations would not be the same as  .",
    "that is , there would be no delay terms ; the delay terms here would only have the affect of altering the parameters in the usual hopf normal form .",
    "see  @xcite for more details .    at the bifurcation point ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 has one real negative eigenvalue ( which we denote by @xmath71 ) , and a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "the center manifold of the original problem with no feedback is therefore two - dimensional , and the eigenvectors of @xmath70 can be found explicitly ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "close to the bifurcation point , the subcritical orbit will lie in a two - dimensional manifold which is close to the center subspace at the bifurcation point .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the matrix of eigenvectors which puts @xmath76 in jordan normal form , that is @xmath77 and @xmath78 there is then no feedback in the stable direction , and pyragus - type feedback in the directions tangent to the center manifold .    in the following numerical results , we set @xmath79 , as in fiedler  _ et al_. , and vary @xmath34 .",
    "we use the continuation package dde - biftool  @xcite to analyze the delay - differential equation  .",
    "the primary bifurcation parameter is @xmath6 , with the subcritical hopf bifurcation for the system without feedback occurring at @xmath80 .",
    "recall we have set @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath79 .",
    "first , we locate hopf bifurcations of the trivial solution in the @xmath6-@xmath3 plane , for various values of @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig : thtp ] shows curves of hopf bifurcations @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we also plot the curve @xmath84 , given by the period of the bifurcating subcritical orbits ( see figure  [ fig : sub ] ) . figure  [ fig :",
    "thtp ] is qualitatively similar to figure  [ fig : thtp ] ( the corresponding figure for the normal form case ) . for @xmath82",
    ", @xmath63 lies inside @xmath85 , and so we expect , by analogy with the normal form case , that choosing @xmath84 will stabilize the pyragus orbit . for @xmath83 , @xmath63 lies outside @xmath85 , and so the feedback can not stabilize the pyragus orbit near onset , since it bifurcates subcritically ( i.e.  it coexists with the stable equilibrium from which it bifurcates ) .",
    "the codimension - two point occurs at some value of @xmath34 that is the boundary between these cases .",
    "we use dde - biftool to locate this codimension - two point . as in the normal form case , we set @xmath84 .",
    "we do not have an analytic form for @xmath63 , so we numerically estimate @xmath63 in the following way . for @xmath86",
    "we set @xmath63 equal to the period of the bifurcating period orbits for the system with no feedback ( see figure  [ fig : sub ] ) .",
    "we want to continue @xmath63 into @xmath87 , so we can complete both sides of the bifurcation diagram , so here we set @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "this choice of @xmath91 ensures that @xmath63 is continuous and has continuous first derivative at @xmath69 .    with the parameter restriction @xmath84",
    ", we generate curves of hopf bifurcations from the zero solution in the @xmath6-@xmath34 plane ; these are shown in figure  [ fig : lor_hopfs ] .    we can then estimate the location of the codimension - two point , at @xmath92 , the point where the two curves of hopf bifurcations cross .",
    "we find @xmath93 .",
    "we follow a path around the codimension - two point and track the amplitude and stability of the bifurcating periodic orbits ; a bifurcation diagram of the periodic orbits is shown in figure  [ fig : lor_hopfs ] .",
    "the transcritical bifurcation of periodic orbits can clearly be seen .",
    "note that figure  [ fig : lor_hopfs ] is qualitatively similar to figure  [ fig : bifs ] , showing that the bifurcation structure in the normal form case , and in our lorenz example are the same .    with the additional feedback ,",
    "the pyragus orbits are stable for a wide parameter range .    in figure",
    "[ fig : po_stab ] , we show the stability of the pyragus orbits as @xmath6 and @xmath34 are varied .",
    "the transcritical bifurcation can be seen as the boundary of the stable region which terminates at the codimension - two point .",
    "the orbits also undergo an instability at around @xmath94 . along this boundary of the stable region , the periodic orbits have a floquet multiplier equal to @xmath95 , and so the instability is a period - doubling bifurcation .    in figure  [",
    "fig : tplot1 ] we show results of forward time integration of the delay - differential equation  , at @xmath96 , with @xmath97 .",
    "initally , @xmath82 , and the pyragus orbit is stable .",
    "the feedback is then turned off ( i.e.  @xmath98 ) at @xmath99 , and the trajectory decays back to the zero solution .",
    "we have used dde - biftool to confirm the stability of these orbits .",
    "the structure around the codimension - two point also tells us that the delay - induced orbits can be stable in the region @xmath87 .",
    "for example , at @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , we can use dde - biftool to show that there exists a stable delay - induced periodic orbit with a period of @xmath103 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tplot2 ] shows time integration at these parameter values , with feedback turned on at @xmath104 . the figure shows the chaotic attractor for @xmath105 and an approach to a stable periodic orbit for @xmath106 .",
    "another natural choice for the gain matrix @xmath68 is a real multiple of the identity . as a comparison to the results given above",
    ", we now consider this case , so write @xmath107 for this choice of @xmath68 we can obtain analytical results , and we show that the bifurcation structure is different from our previous example , whatever the value of @xmath34 . we show first that unstable periodic orbits with real positive floquet exponents can not be stabilised using this form of feedback .",
    "we then discuss the shape and location of the curves of hopf bifurcation from the origin , in a similar manner to the previous section , to give a comparison of the two types of feedback .",
    "the codimension - two point described previously does not exist , and the hopf bifurcation to the pyragus orbit is always subcritical .",
    "that is , the periodic orbit in @xmath86 always bifurcates unstably from an equilibrium which is stable in @xmath86 and unstable in @xmath87 .",
    "consider a pyragus solution @xmath108 of  , which is periodic with period @xmath3 , and with @xmath68 as in  .",
    "then if @xmath109 is a floquet exponent of @xmath110 ( in the system with no feedback ) , the characteristic equation for @xmath110 in the system with feedback is given by @xmath111 both here , and in the analysis which follows below , simplification is possible because @xmath68 is a multiple of the identity .",
    "if @xmath110 has one floquet exponent @xmath109 which is real and positive , then it can be shown ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that there always exists at least one solution @xmath12 which is real and positive .",
    "hence stabilization of @xmath110 can not be achieved .",
    "we note that at the subcritical hopf bifurcation from the zero solution in  , the orbit which bifurcates has one real stable multiplier ( inherited from the zero solution ) and one neutral multiplier , and so the remaining unstable multiplier must be real . therefore the pyragus orbit can not be stabilized close to the hopf bifurcation using this type of feedback .    in addition",
    ", we now follow the method of the previous section to find curves of hopf bifurcations of the zero solution of   in @xmath6-@xmath3 space .",
    "this provides us with a comparison of the two types of feedback used in this and the previous section .",
    "we are particularly interested in those curves which pass through @xmath112 , with hopf frequency equal to @xmath113 , as this is the hopf bifurcation to the pyragus orbit .",
    "consider the linearisation of   about the origin , and write @xmath114 .",
    "then @xmath115 and so for a non - trivial solution ( @xmath116 ) to exist , @xmath12 must satisfy the characteristic equation : @xmath117=0.\\ ] ] note that we have been able to simplify this equation because in this example @xmath68 is a multiple of the identity .",
    "this tells us that @xmath118 are the eigenvalues of @xmath119 .",
    "when @xmath6 is close to @xmath120 , @xmath119 has one negative eigenvalue @xmath121 , and a complex conjugate pair we denote as @xmath122 .",
    "note that @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .    we find curves of hopf bifurcations in @xmath6-@xmath3 space , by writing @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) and setting @xmath127 equal to the eigenvalues of @xmath119 , @xmath128 .",
    "we note that setting @xmath127 equal to the negative eigenvalue of @xmath119 , @xmath121 , does not produce any hopf curves which pass through @xmath112 , so we do not consider these here .",
    "equating real and imaginary parts gives @xmath129 equations   and   describe curves of hopf bifurcations in @xmath6-@xmath3 space , parameterized by the hopf frequency @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hopf_id ] shows examples of the shape of these hopf curves ; compare with figure  [ fig : thtp ] showing the hopf curves in our previous example .",
    "the zero solution is unstable to the right of the curves and stable to the left of the curves .",
    "we now explain why we expect the curves to have this shape .",
    "we have : @xmath130 note that we need @xmath131 for solutions to exist .",
    "that is , if @xmath132 , we need @xmath133 , and if @xmath134 , we need @xmath135 .",
    "since @xmath136 is a monotonically increasing function over the range of @xmath6 we are considering , this gives a connected range of @xmath6 for which hopf bifurcations can occur , with boundaries at @xmath69 ( since @xmath123 ) and at @xmath137 ( where @xmath138 ) .",
    "note that at @xmath69 , @xmath139 , and so this is the hopf bifurcation to the pyragus orbit .",
    "the solutions for @xmath3 along the hopf curve solve @xmath140 since @xmath123 , at @xmath69 , @xmath141 , and similarly since @xmath138 , at @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "the curve of hopf bifurcations is thus tangent to the lines @xmath69 and @xmath142 , and forms a series of wiggles between these value of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the curve is tangent to @xmath69 at @xmath144 ) , where @xmath145 , the hopf bifurcation to the pyragus orbit .",
    "therefore , for any value of @xmath34 , the pyragus curve @xmath84 ( which originates at @xmath112 , and is also shown in figure  [ fig : hopf_id ] ) , will always be to the left of the hopf curves at @xmath69 .",
    "the zero equilibrium is therefore stable along the pyragus curve close to the bifurcation point in @xmath86 , and so the pyragus orbit will always bifurcate unstably .",
    "figure  [ fig : postab ] shows a contour plot of the largest floquet multipliers of the periodic orbit , as @xmath6 and @xmath34 are varied .",
    "for all values shown the periodic orbit is unstable .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated how the mechanism used by fiedler  _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite for stabilizing periodic orbits with one unstable floquet multiplier carries over to higher dimensional systems , using the lorenz equations as an example .",
    "we use the results from their idealized example to inform our choice of the feedback gain matrix , and this method follows a set prescription which we expect could be used on other systems . first we find the two - dimensional linear center eigenspace of the system with no feedback at the hopf bifurcation point .",
    "feedback is then added in the directions lying tangent to this center subspace , using a @xmath146 gain matrix of the form given by fiedler  _ et al .",
    "this then leaves only the two parameters @xmath45 and @xmath34 to be chosen .",
    "for the example of the lorenz equation , the subcritical orbits are stabilized over a wide range of parameters .",
    "we contrast this with an example of choosing the gain matrix as a real multiple of the identity . in this case",
    "the pyragus orbit could not be stabilised .    choosing the gain matrix for our lorenz equations example required a knowledge of the linearization of the system at the bifurcation point .",
    "this method may also be applicable in systems for which the governing equations are not known , if it is possible to access perturbations to the equilibrium solution near the hopf bifurcation point , and hence extract the unstable eigenvectors numerically from experimental data .",
    "we have additionally shown that the lorenz equations example contains a codimension - two point which is also present in the normal form example of  @xcite .",
    "this double - hopf point is not generic . in the normal form example of  @xcite",
    "there is an additional @xmath147 symmetry which is not present in the lorenz example .",
    "additional structures in the problem force a normally codimension - three phenomena  @xcite to be codimension - two , since the frequencies of the bifurcating periodic orbits are forced to be in one : one resonance at the codimension - two point .",
    "it would be of interest to examine this degeneracy in more detail , by understanding the mathematics behind the structure of the hopf - hopf bifurcation in these examples .",

    "<S> for many years it was believed that an unstable periodic orbit with an odd number of real floquet multipliers greater than unity can not be stabilized by the time - delayed feedback control mechanism of pyragus . a recent paper by fiedler  _ et al .  _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite uses the normal form of a subcritical hopf bifurcation to give a counterexample to this theorem . using the lorenz equations as an example , we demonstrate that the stabilization mechanism identified by fiedler  _ et al .  _ for the hopf normal form can also apply to unstable periodic orbits created by subcritical hopf bifurcations in higher - dimensional dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis focuses on a particular codimension - two bifurcation that captures the stabilization mechanism in the hopf normal form example , and we show that the same codimension - two bifurcation is present in the lorenz equations with appropriately chosen pyragus - type time - delayed feedback . </S>",
    "<S> this example suggests a possible strategy for choosing the feedback gain matrix in pyragus control of unstable periodic orbits that arise from a subcritical hopf bifurcation of a stable equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our choice of feedback gain matrix is informed by the fiedler  _ et al .  </S>",
    "<S> _ example , and it works over a broad range of parameters , despite the fact that a center - manifold reduction of the higher - dimensional problem does not lead to their model problem . </S>"
