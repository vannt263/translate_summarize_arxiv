    "as populations are increasingly concentrated in big cities , the congestion problem becomes more critical .",
    "one practical way to solve the congestion problem is sharing of unused resources .",
    "for example , even during heavy traffic congestion , many vehicles have empty seats .",
    "similarly , many empty vehicles occupy limited parking spaces in urban areas while people struggle to find an empty taxi . besides the transportation field",
    ", we can find examples such as unused buildings , empty restaurants , and idle workers .",
    "however , the sharing of unused resources is not realized unless there are matching demands of multiple users .",
    "empty vehicle seats are shared among passengers only if they have a common part on their routes .",
    "a vehicle is shared only if the destination of a driver is equal to the origin of another driver .",
    "if people behave selfishly , the probability of matching the demand for sharing becomes small , leading to the problem of demand coordination and incentive design .",
    "particular to the sharing of vehicles is that positive and negative externalities of one player s route change are propagated to other players who do not choose the relevant routes via changes in vehicle supply .",
    "consider a chain of vehicle sharing in which player 1 first drives a vehicle from a to b , then player 2 drives the same vehicle from b to c , and player 3 drives the vehicle from c to d. if player 1 quits to use the vehicle , player 2 and even 3 can not use the vehicle even though player 3 does not share any part of his route with player 1 . because classical congestion games only focus on externalities among players who choose the same routes ,",
    "it is necessary to consider alternative games that model externalities via vehicle supply to analyze coordination in vehicle sharing .",
    "this study formulates ride sharing games that model the positive and negative externalities of choosing vehicles .",
    "we also consider how to coordinate players to improve the efficiency of sharing , i.e. , maximizing the operation rate of otherwise unused vehicles by giving players an incentive .",
    "we mainly assume applications in transportation areas , such as carpooling and ride sharing .      ....       ....    ....      congestion gamepoacongestion gamea->b->ca->cpoa       ....    since rosenthal introduced the congestion game@xcite , it has been applied to problems of congestion externalities in several areas such as transportation and communication networks@xcite . in this game , players choose a combination of resources and the players payoffs depend on the congestion level , i.e. , the number of players using the same resources .",
    "the congestion game is a subclass of potential games , which feature the _ finite improvement property _ ( fip ) .",
    "this property guarantees that if each player updates his strategy in response to other players by turns , it will reduce his private cost and improve the common potential function , which eventually reaches a local minimum , the _ pure nash equilibrium _ ( pne ) , where each player has a deterministic strategy .",
    "because of this property , potential and congestion games have been well studied and have wide applications@xcite .",
    "the negative externalities in congestion games are also well studied .",
    "if players choose their routes selfishly in road networks , it causes loss of social welfare compared to socially optimal routing .",
    "the ratio of social cost in a selfish choice to the one in the social optimal is called the _ price of anarchy _ ( poa ) and its bounds are well known , especially for affine cost functions@xcite .",
    "studies on poa bound assume that a game has a pne .",
    "because of the property of always having a pne , most poa studies have focused on congestion games .",
    "a major difference between vehicle sharing and traffic routing problems is vehicle supply . while players drive their own vehicles in traditional traffic routing problems , players must find shared vehicles before riding in sharing problems . in the case of a chain of vehicle sharing from player",
    "a via player b to player c , the choice of player a has externalities not only on player b but those also propagate to player c , who does not share any common part of route with player a. this kind of complicated externality is not considered in traditional routing problems and congestion games .    according to a review of sharing studies in transportation areas@xcite , there are few game theory studies on externalities and coordination of players moves in vehicle sharing problems .",
    "traditional studies on sharing include the optimization of vehicle routes for picking up all passengers ( the _ dial - a - ride problem _ ) , problems of splitting passengers fares according to their riding distances , optimization of locations of carpool stations , and problems of relocation of carpool vehicles among stations .",
    "those studies mainly focus on optimization problems under given moves ( origins and destinations ) of passengers and fixed drivers of vehicles , and therefore , do not analyze the poa when passengers strategically choose their moves in response to the moves of other passengers and vehicles .",
    "the review states that there are no studies on coordination of players moves to improve the efficiency of sharing or reduce the poa .",
    "there are several studies that examine the coordination of players in traditional traffic routing and congestion games .",
    "one promising technique for coordination is the mechanism design , which mainly provides monetary incentives for players to change their behavior in a coordinated manner .",
    "christodoulou studied coordination mechanism in congestion games@xcite .",
    "another relatively new technique for coordination is signaling , in which a mediator provides information for players to control their beliefs on uncertain environments , and accordingly , the expected payoff and resulting choices when there is information asymmetry between the mediator and players@xcite .",
    "most recent studies are based on the _ revelation principle _ , which proved the existence of incentive compatible recommendations of choices equivalent to the raw information inducing the same choices@xcite .",
    "rogers applied differential privacy techniques originally from database security to traffic routing problems for mitigating congestions by sending noisy incentive compatible recommendations of routes@xcite .",
    "vasserman also applied recommendations to traffic routing and analyzed how the poa improved@xcite .      ....",
