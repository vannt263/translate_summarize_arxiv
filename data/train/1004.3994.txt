    "second , we approximate the thickness of the stack to be also much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions . we need this in order to fit the branes comfortably , and to treat them as noninteracting , so that we can use eq .",
    "this can be checked to be an adequate approximation , and indeed is aided by the swelling of the extra dimensions in the vicinity of the stack .",
    "third , we ignore the four - dimensional curvature of the ads true vacuum , which was shown by coleman and de luccia @xcite to impede tunneling . though these corrections are easy enough to include , they are negligible in our case , since the size of the bubble ( @xmath157 ) is much smaller than the ads curvature length ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the fourth approximation is that the wall is thin ( which also justifies treating the integral ` back ' as being equal to the integral ` out ' ) .",
    "this approximation is our weakest .",
    "it is also uncontrolled  the toy model we have chosen , the 6d einstein - maxwell model , is too austere to be able to tune the wall thickness , since both @xmath132 and @xmath66 are controlled by the same parameter , @xmath105 .",
    "the reason we nevertheless work in the thin - wall limit is that it is the clearest context in which to provide an intuitive understanding of the phenomenon of giant leaps . to investigate giant leaps away from the thin - wall limit requires a numerical analysis , which will appear in an upcoming work .",
    "the probe - brane approximation freezes the size and shape of the extra dimensions . in this section , we have partially moved away from this limit by unfreezing the volume modulus , but , and this is the fifth approximation , we keep the shape moduli fixed ( equivalent to treating the brane as smeared round the extra dimensions ) .",
    "this approximation overestimates @xmath55 . by optimizing over the size of the sphere we have greatly hastened decay to distant minima ;",
    "optimizing also over the shape will only make the false vacuum decay faster and leap farther .",
    "in sec .  [ secii ]",
    "we constructed a two - field model with a crucial ingredient , a direction in which the potential asymptotes to zero , and we showed that this theory exhibits giant leaps .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] , we found the same ingredient in a simple flux compactification  the effective potential for the volume modulus also asymptotes to zero .",
    "we showed that this theory , too , exhibits giant leaps in the thin - wall limit .",
    "dine and seiberg argued that such a run - away direction in the effective potential , asymptoting to zero , is standard in all compactifications , arising as the coupling goes to zero or the warping goes to infinity @xcite .",
    "since this crucial ingredient appears in all flux compactifications , there is good reason to believe that giant leaps are generic .    as such , and",
    "as they are most important near @xmath27 , it is natural to wonder if giant leaps have anything to say about the cosmological constant .",
    "we find that they are relevant in two ways , both problematic : first , by opening up a new decay route , they make it harder to build long - lived vacua with small cosmological constants ; and second , such vacua can be leapt over rather than landed in , complicating landscape - style resolutions of the cosmological constant problem .      if you only knew about small steps , and did nt know that , sometimes , @xmath159 , then you would underestimate decay rates , and overestimate lifetimes .",
    "worse , you would be most wrong exactly when you are most interested in being most right : near @xmath27 .",
    "vacua that appear acceptably stable in the probe - brane approximation may actually decay unacceptably fast .",
    "fortunately , we can give a surprisingly general characterization of the rate of decay by giant leaps .",
    "the probe - brane approximation , keeping @xmath113 fixed at its vacuum value , is an overestimate of @xmath55 that becomes increasingly accurate for the lightest branes .",
    "let s consider the opposite limit , the heavy - brane limit .",
    "let s have @xmath113 deform all the way out to infinity in the vicinity of the stack .",
    "this too will be an overestimate of @xmath55 , but this time one that becomes increasingly accurate for the heaviest branes . in this approximation",
    "the tension of the stack is completely redshifted away ",
    "the only contribution to @xmath8 is from the barrier penetration of @xmath113 , which in the thin - wall limit is @xmath160 , where @xmath113 runs between its minimum value and infinity . for the heaviest branes",
    ", @xmath8 approaches a constant independent of @xmath161 , and this constant is precisely twice the tension of the wall required to decompactify .",
    "sure enough , in the 6d einstein - maxwell theory , as @xmath162 in eq .",
    "[ sigman ] , @xmath8 approaches @xmath163 , which is twice the decompactification integral .",
    "armed with this upper bound , we can make a back - of - the - envelope calculation of the decay rate for any flux compactification landscape . for any transition , in any flux compactification ,",
    "all we need to know is @xmath7 and the radion potential and we can give an upper bound on the lifetime , without knowing anything about the tension of the mediating brane .",
    "let s see how this works in the kklt compactification of type iib string theory @xcite , which gives rise to an effective four - dimensional theory with a small positive cosmological constant .",
    "several decay modes have been considered already : the original paper considered decompactification , and then frey , lippert and williams  @xcite considered brane - flux annihilation in the manner of kpv @xcite . in this type of transition , the @xmath164-branes , sitting at the tip of the throat , blow up into an ns5-brane , which removes the antibrane flux on the inside of the bubble , reducing the effective four - dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite treated this process in the probe - brane limit .",
    "they found , depending on model parameters , that brane - flux annihilation can beat decompactification , and they calculated values of @xmath55 around @xmath165 to @xmath166 .",
    "let s move away from the probe - brane limit .",
    "as we ve just argued , in the heavy - brane thin - wall limit , we can approximate @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the potential for the volume modulus , so that @xmath169 . here",
    ", @xmath7 is given by the scale of the uplifting done by the antibranes , so that @xmath170 .",
    "putting these estimates into eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] gives @xmath171 .",
    "including thick - wall and gravitational corrections will raise this value , but the fact that it is competitive with the probe - brane approximation testifies to the importance of unfreezing the radion during this transition .    and what about other transitions ?",
    "in addition to kpv - style transitions , there are a large number of possible decays that take place in the body of the calabi - yau manifold where fluxes thread various cycles .",
    "these transitions are also mediated by the nucleation of charged branes and again we can apply our estimate . for all these decays",
    ", @xmath8 is roughly @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , any transition with large enough @xmath7 would pose a threat to the stability of the kklt vacuum . since @xmath173 corresponds to lifetimes comparable to the age of the universe , a transition with roughly @xmath174 would invalidate the construction .      anthropic resolutions of the cosmological constant problem require a vast discretuum of finely - spaced minima and a mechanism to populate the habitable ones near @xmath27 .",
    "bousso and polchinski constructed such a landscape in m theory @xcite out of flux threading hundreds of different three - cycles of an internal manifold .",
    "just as in 6d einstein - maxwell theory , transitions occur by the nucleation branes  here , m5-branes .",
    "whatever mechanism you use to stabilize the volume modulus , its effective potential is guaranteed to go to zero in the large volume limit @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect giant leaps near @xmath27 .",
    "the problem is that these giant leaps can leap you straight past the habitable vacua .",
    "the universe starts with a large cosmological constant and then sheds flux  at first one brane at a time , but then , as it nears @xmath27 , whole stacks at once .",
    "the habitable vacua we were hoping to populate are exactly the ones that get skipped .",
    "what this means for landscape - style resolutions of the cosmological constant problem is unclear .",
    "though giant leaps make landing in a vacuum with a small cosmological constant less likely , they do not make it impossible .",
    "there will be fewer bubbles of such vacua than before , and in that sense we have added to the burden of the selection criterion .",
    "but there are still some , and a robust enough anthropic cut will still be able to pick them out .",
    "we have found giant leaps in a toy two - field model and , in the thin - wall approximation , in the landscape of 6d einstein - maxwell theory , and have argued for their importance in more general flux compactifications .",
    "these systems share a runaway ` decompactification ' direction in which the potential goes asymptotically to zero , and unfreezing this ` radion ' mode encourages decays to wildly distant minima .",
    "this effect is strongest for vacua with a small cosmological constant and , as such , could provide the dominant decay mode of our false vacuum , so that our world will end not with a small step , but with a giant leap .",
