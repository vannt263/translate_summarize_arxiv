    "current classification schemes for the two latest spectral classes , l dwarfs @xcite and t dwarfs @xcite , are defined in different spectral regions .",
    "l dwarf classification is tied to the red optical region ( 630010000  ) , enabling straightforward comparison with m dwarf classification schemes @xcite , and hence a well - defined demarcation of the m and l spectral classes .",
    "t dwarf classification is tied to the near - infrared region ( 12.5 @xmath5 ) , taking advantage of both greater relative brightness ( @xmath4 75% of the emergent flux ) and the presence of strong h@xmath0o and defining ch@xmath1 bands .",
    "classifications in different spectral regions can not be expected to be identical , however , due to the competing influences of temperature , gravity , and composition at different wavelengths .",
    "this is particularly the case for late - type m , l , and t dwarfs , whose molecular - rich atmospheres also contain condensate clouds , predominantly affecting near - infrared spectral flux @xcite .",
    "the influence of these chemical and physical variables muddle the characterization of the l / t transition , a spectromorphological boundary that encompasses a dramatic shift in near - infrared colors ( j  k @xmath6 2 @xmath7 0 ) , condensate opacity , and overall spectral energy distribution .",
    "clearly , the evolution of both near - infrared and optical spectra must be examined to fully characterize this critical transition .",
    "the red optical spectra of t dwarfs are of interest in their own right , as they encompass unique features and diagnostics of physical parameters .",
    "early investigation of the prototype of this class , gliese 229b @xcite , revealed strong h@xmath0o and weak ch@xmath1 molecular absorption ( counterparts to the strong bands that dominate the near - infrared spectrum ) , cs i alkali lines , and a steep red spectral slope shortward of 1 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the latter feature , attributable to the pressure - broadened wings of the 7665/7699  k i resonant doublet lines @xcite , is responsible for the extremely red optical / near - infrared colors of this object ( r  j @xmath4 9.1 ; matthews et al .  1996 , golimowski et al .",
    "1998 ) , a property that has been exploited in the search for t dwarfs in wide - field surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss ) .",
    "@xcite have shown that these heavily - broadened lines and their 5890/5896  na i counterparts are sensitive to both effective temperature ( t@xmath8 ) and specific gravity .",
    "the much weaker cs i lines are key tracers of atmospheric rainout @xcite .",
    "additional molecular bands of feh and crh reported in the spectra of mid - type t dwarfs @xcite are possible tracers of condensate cloud opacity across the l / t transition @xcite .",
    "finally , persistent h@xmath2 emission detected in the t dwarf 2mass 1237 + 6526 @xcite , whose atmosphere is predicted to be too cool to support a substantial chromosphere @xcite , is not yet understood and has been the subject of some debate @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we continue the spectroscopic investigation of t dwarfs initiated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) by examining their red optical spectra .",
    "this article complements that of @xcite , which discusses the optical l / t transition in detail . in @xmath92",
    "we describe the acquisition and reduction of the data , obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( * ? ? ? * hereafter lris ) mounted on the keck i 10 m telescope . in @xmath93",
    "we present the reduced spectra , analyzing in detail the spectral features observed . in @xmath94",
    "we present a classification scheme for mid- and late - type t dwarfs using red optical spectra that is parallel to , but independent of , the near - infrared scheme of @xcite .",
    "in @xmath95 we discuss our results , including the physical properties of the peculiar t dwarf 2mass 0937 + 2931 , a possible means of disentangling gravity and temperature in red optical spectra , and a comparison between t dwarf optical and near - infrared classifications .",
    "we summarize our results in @xmath96 .",
    "we acquired lris red optical spectra for a sample of 13 t dwarfs identified in 2mass @xcite and sdss @xcite on three nights , 2000 march 5 , 2001 february 20 , and 2003 january 2 ( ut ) .",
    "an observing log is given in table 1 .",
    "conditions during our march 2000 and january 2003 observations were clear with seeing @xmath10 1@xmath11 ; our february 2001 observations were made through light clouds with 1@xmath11 seeing .",
    "lris is nominally a dual spectrograph with a 5500  dichroic mirror separating incoming light into two ( red and blue ) channels . for all observations",
    ", we used only the red channel with a mirror bypassing the dichroic .",
    "the og570 order - blocking filter was employed to suppress higher - order light , and a 1@xmath11 ( 4.7 pixels ) slit was used with the 400 lines mm@xmath12 grating blazed at 8500  , yielding 630010100  spectra with @xmath47  resolution ( r @xmath4 1200 ) .",
    "dispersion on the chip was 1.9  pixel@xmath12 .",
    "targets were nominally acquired using the facility guide camera ; objects that were too optically faint to be seen in the guider image were placed into the slit by blind offset from a nearby visible source , using offset values determined from 2mass coordinates .",
    "individual exposures ranged from 1200 to 1800 sec , with up to four observations obtained on a particular night .",
    "observations of the b1 v flux standard hiltner 600 @xcite were obtained for flux calibration on all runs using the same instrumental configuration . to correct for telluric absorption , we observed either da / dc / dz white dwarfs selected from @xcite or late - f / early - g stars before or after the target observations and at similar airmass .",
    "these stars typically have few or no features in the red optical telluric absorption bands .",
    "quartz lamp flat - field exposures ( reflected off of the interior dome ) were observed at the start of each run to calibrate detector response , and near arc lamp exposures were obtained immediately after the target observations for wavelength calibration .",
    "science data were reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "first , we removed the image bias . for the march 2000 data ,",
    "this was done by median - combining a series of one - second bias frames , and subtracting this image from the science and calibration data . for the february 2001 and january 2003 data , the bias level for each row was derived from the mean counts in the overscan region and subtracted .",
    "images were trimmed and divided by the median - combined and normalized flat - field exposures to correct for detector response .",
    "spectra were then extracted using the iraf apextract package .",
    "curvature of the dispersion line was determined from either the telluric or flux standard star exposures and used as a template for the target extractions .",
    "all spectral data were optimally extracted with a cleaning algorithm to eliminate cosmic rays and spurious pixels .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using the arc lamp exposures and line identifications from the nist atomic line database .",
    "we then computed a telluric correction from the telluric calibrator spectra by interpolating over atmospheric o@xmath0 ( @xmath468506900  b - band , @xmath476007700  a - band ) and h@xmath0o ( @xmath471507300 , @xmath481508350 , and @xmath489509650  ; stevenson 1994 ) bands , and then dividing this modified spectrum by the original calibrator spectrum .",
    "this correction spectrum was applied to both target and flux standard data to eliminate telluric absorption from the spectrum .",
    "we note that we acquired the wrong star as the telluric calibrator for 2mass 0937 + 2931 .",
    "wd 0924 + 199 ( a.k.a  pg 0924 + 199 , ton 1061 ) is classified dc5 @xcite , with a possible indication of h@xmath2 absorption and an 11,000 k blackbody continuum .",
    "our observations show a roughly 5000 k blackbody continuum , weak and narrow h@xmath2 absorption , a strong ca ii resonance triplet ( 8498 , 8542 , & 8662  ) and a ba ii line at 6497  .",
    "this object is likely a background f / g - type dwarf , and fortuitously works fine as a telluric calibrator .    finally , flux calibration was done by correcting our hiltner 600 observations to the spectrophotometric data given by @xcite , being careful to interpolate over telluric absorption regions and the balmer h@xmath2 line .",
    "this correction was applied to the t dwarf data to produce the final calibrated spectra .",
    "if multiple spectra were obtained on a particular night , these were coadded with a sigma - clipping algorithm to improve signal - to - noise .",
    "reduced spectra for the t dwarfs are shown in figure 1 in order of their near - infrared spectral classifications .",
    "features present in the spectra are noted in figure 1 and listed in table 2 ; we discuss these features in detail below .",
    "the strongly pressure - broadened na i and k i resonance doublets suppress most of the optical flux of t dwarfs @xcite . the broad wings of both alkali doublets can be seen clearly in the highest signal - to - noise spectrum of our sample , that of 2mass 0559@xmath31404 , shown in figure 2 with absolute flux density ( calibrated using i@xmath13 photometry and parallax measurements from dahn et al .",
    "2002 ) plotted on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the peak - up in flux between these features is clearly evident , and their shapes are consistent with heavily pressure - broadened atomic lines @xcite .    other alkali line features present in these spectra include the 8521/8943  cs i and 7800/7948  rb i resonant doublets . examination of figure 1 shows that the cs i lines are clearly present in all of the t dwarfs observed , although they become rather weak in the latest - type objects .",
    "rb i lines lie very close to the core of the strong k i doublet , and are generally only seen in our higher signal - to - noise spectra ( e.g. , figure 2 ) .",
    "we have measured pseudo - equivalent widths ( pews ) for each of the cs i and rb i lines as follows : first , we subtracted a linear fit to the local pseudo - continuum , @xmath14 , to yield the line profile , @xmath15 .",
    "next , we fit each line profile to a lorentzian function of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( the transition wavelength in  ) , and @xmath19 ( the effective line width in  ) were left as free parameters .",
    "fits were made iteratively and confirmed by eye to eliminate spurious matches to noise spikes .",
    "finally , pseudo - equivalent widths were derived from @xmath20 uncertainties , or upper limits in the cases where no line could be visually identified , were derived from the uncertainty in the continuum fit and residuals in a 40 region of the spectrum around each alkali line after the line profile fit . in cases where the continuum was essentially undetected",
    ", no pew upper limits could be derived .",
    "values are listed in table 3 .",
    "early- and mid - type t dwarfs have cs i pews @xmath6 79  , with the exception of 2mass 0755 + 2212 , whose short wavelength spectrum is partly filled in by flux from a nearly - aligned background galaxy @xcite .",
    "both cs i lines weaken in the later - type objects , particularly the 8521  line , which is weakest and only marginally detected in the t8 2mass 0415@xmath30935 ( 1.8@xmath211.4  ) .",
    "the residual strength of the 8943  line may be the result of contamination by ch@xmath1 absorption ( @xmath93.2 ; figure 4 ) .",
    "these trends are consistent with chemical equilibrium calculations by @xcite , which predict a gradual chemical depletion of cs to cscl at t @xmath10 1300 k , accelerated at t @xmath10 1000 k as nacl ( and atomic na ) converts to na@xmath0s and liberates elemental cl .",
    "note that k is depleted to kcl around the same temperature @xcite , weakening the k i wing and reducing the suppression of the local pseudo - continuum around the cs i lines . that the cs i lines nevertheless wane in the later t dwarfs",
    "provides supporting evidence that elemental cs is in fact depleted in their photospheres .",
    "the 7948  rb i line could be measured in about two - thirds of the objects in our sample .",
    "line strengths for the early- and mid - type t dwarfs vary substantially , likely due to the decreased signal - to - noise in this spectral region .",
    "surprisingly , many of the latest - type t dwarfs shown detectable , albeit marginal , 7948  rb i absorption .",
    "figure 3 shows a close - up around this line for five t dwarfs with positive detections ; for 2mass 0727 + 1710 , gliese 570d , and 2mass 0415@xmath30935 , these detections are clearly marginal . nonetheless , the resurgence of the rb i line could be a real effect . as with k , atomic rb",
    "is depleted to rbcl for t @xmath10 1000 k @xcite .",
    "the lower depletion temperature for rb implies a much higher relative abundance than cs in the later t dwarfs , particularly as rb is roughly 20 times more abundant in a solar metallicity mixture @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the weakening of the k i red wing is likely to enhance rb i pews .",
    "the 7800  rb i line is only detected in our two brightest t dwarfs , 2mass 0559@xmath31404 and 2mass 1503 + 2525 , with pews of 6@xmath215 and 12@xmath215  , respectively .",
    "one glaring absence among the alkali features is the 6708  li i resonance doublet .",
    "2mass 0559@xmath31404 shows a possible feature close to this line ( figure 2 ) , but it is offset at 6690  and is likely a residual noise spike .",
    "all of the objects in our sample are presumably substellar based on their low t@xmath8s @xcite , and a good fraction likely have masses below the 0.06 m@xmath22 limit for li core fusion depletion @xcite . however ,",
    "none exhibit li i absorption .",
    "atomic li is chemically depleted to licl , lih , and lioh for t @xmath10 1500 @xcite , at hotter temperatures than na , k , rb , and cs .",
    "a general weakening of the li i line is observed in substellar late - type l dwarfs @xcite , and the absence of this line in the t dwarfs is consistent with a temperature effect .",
    "however , we note that these observations are not consistent with current spectral models that use the @xcite chemical abundances , which continue to exhibit detectable li i absorption down to t@xmath8 @xmath6 600800 k @xcite .",
    "confirmation of chemical depletion for all of the alkali species will require examination of their respective chloride bands at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the most prominent molecular features in the red optical spectra of t dwarfs are the h@xmath0o bands at 9250 and 9450  .",
    "these bands strengthen considerably toward the latest - type objects in our sample , but are generally weaker than their near - infrared counterparts .",
    "as is the case in the near - infrared , the steam bands overlap telluric h@xmath0o absorption at 89509700  ( strongest from 93009650  ; stevenson 1994 ) ; however , the hotter brown dwarf bands clearly extend blueward to 9250  .",
    "the 9896  wing - ford feh band is seen quite clearly in many of the spectra of figure 1 ; figure 2 of @xcite shows a close - up of this feature and the 9969  crh band .",
    "both bands are strongest in mid - type t dwarfs like 2mass 1534@xmath32952ab , but are weak or absent in the latest - type t dwarfs .",
    "the identification of the crh band may be in error , as @xcite find that absorption in this region for m and l dwarfs is entirely attributable to feh absorption . while opacity data from @xcite clearly show a crh bandhead at this wavelength , its visibility depends on the relative abundance of crh to feh , as their opacities are roughly equal in strength at these wavelengths @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicts an equilibrium abundance crh / feh @xmath6 10@xmath23 for 1800 @xmath10 t @xmath10 2500 k , but a higher relative abundance of @xmath40.3 for t @xmath10 1500 k. hence , it is entirely possible that the 9969  crh band is by feh absorption in m and l dwarf spectra , but detectable in the cooler t dwarf spectra .",
    "higher - resolution observations are required to test this possibility .",
    "the shorter - wavelength counterparts of the feh and crh bands at 8692 and 8611  , respectively , are present in the spectrum of sdss 1254@xmath30122 , but absent in the remaining spectra .",
    "a weak signature of cah at 67507150  , seen in m and l dwarf spectra , also appears to be present but weak in the spectra of 2mass 0559@xmath31404 ( figure 2 ) , sdss 1254@xmath30122 , and 2mass 1503 + 2525 , and is not seen in any of the other spectra .",
    "in chemical equilibrium , cah and elemental ca are expected to be depleted to the solid minerals perovskite ( catio@xmath24 ) , grossite ( caal@xmath0o@xmath1 ) , hibonite ( caal@xmath25o@xmath26 ) , and gehlenite ( ca@xmath0al@xmath0sio@xmath27 ) at t @xmath10 1900 k @xcite .",
    "the detection of this weak band in mid - type t dwarfs is therefore unexpected and may be indicative of non - equilibrium processes .",
    "however , improved opacities for cah are needed before this scenario can be properly explored .    while ch@xmath1 is ubiquitous in the near - infrared spectra of t dwarfs , only the relatively weak 8950  ch@xmath1 band , noted by @xcite in gliese 229b , is likely to be present in the red optical spectra of the latest - type t dwarfs .",
    "figure 4 shows a close - up of this spectral region for six t dwarfs including gliese 229b .",
    "absorption at the base of the 8943  cs i line clearly becomes very broad in the later - type objects , and is strongest in 2mass 0415@xmath30935 .",
    "as shown in this figure , the breadth of this absorption is much greater than that expected for a pressure - broadened line , which exhibits a lorentzian line profile at detunings of a few 10s of angstroms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cs i pews are weakening in the latest - type t dwarfs , while the broad absorption in this region is clearly strengthening .",
    "below the spectra we plot a ch@xmath1 opacity spectrum generated from the hitran database ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see references in burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) . while the broad trough around the cs i line , and a weak feature at 8835  in the spectrum of 2mass 0415@xmath30935 , are generally consistent with the ch@xmath1 opacity data , none of the t dwarf spectra , including that of gliese 229b , exhibit the strongest feature in the opacity data at 8875  .",
    "however , it is important to consider that the ch@xmath1 opacity data is based on laboratory and planetary measurements made at temperatures significantly below those of a typical t dwarf photosphere ; hence , the overall band shape may be somewhat different in the latter environment . pending improved opacity data , we consider the detection of ch@xmath1 at 8950  to be tentative .",
    "three other ch@xmath1 features at 7300 , 8000 , and 10000  seen in planetary and laboratory spectra @xcite are intrinsically weaker than the 8950  band and are not seen in the t dwarf data .",
    "h@xmath2 emission at 6563  is detected in three objects in our sample : 2mass 1047 + 2124 , 2mass 1237 + 6526 ( previously reported in burgasser et al .",
    "2000a ) , and sdss 1254@xmath30122 .",
    "figure 5 shows a close - up of the h@xmath2 spectral region for these three objects .",
    "note that the emission lines in 2mass 1047 + 2124 and sdss 1254@xmath30122 are very weak , detected at the 2.2 and 3@xmath28 levels , respectively , while the emission in 2mass 1237 + 6526 is substantial .",
    "none of the other t dwarfs exhibit discernible emission at 6563  .",
    "emission fluxes and 3@xmath28 upper limits are listed in table 4 , along with @xmath29 estimates , calculated from 2mass j - band magnitudes and using a linear interpolation of the j - band bolometric correction as a function of near - infrared spectral type , @xmath30 ( spt(t5 ) = 5 , etc . ) .",
    "this relation is based on luminosity estimates for 2mass 0559@xmath31404 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath31 ) , gliese 229b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath32 ) , and gliese 570d ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath33 ) .",
    "for sdss 1254@xmath30122 , we used an average @xmath34 between 2mass 0559@xmath31404 and the latest - type l dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath35 ) .",
    "note that pew measurements of the h@xmath2 line is prohibited in most of these objects by the absence of a detected continuum .",
    "the detection of h@xmath2 emission in three t dwarfs appears to stand contrary to the reduced ionization fractions predicted in their very cool atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the lack of ionized material prevents the coupling of magnetic field lines to the upper atmosphere , thereby discouraging the formation of a substantial chromosphere via collisional heating @xcite .",
    "however , the relative emission luminosity of 2mass 1047 + 2124 and sdss 1254@xmath30122 is roughly 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of active mid - type m dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath36 ) , and is substantially lower than that of active l dwarfs @xcite , as shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "hence , the emission in these objects is consistent with reduced , but existent , chromospheric activity . the strong , persistent emission in 2mass 1237 + 6526",
    "is discussed in further detail in @xcite .",
    "one other emission feature at 7740  is detected in the spectrum of 2mass 0755 + 2212 , noted in figure 1 .",
    "as described in @xcite , this object is aligned with a background galaxy , and the observed emission line is consistent with h@xmath2 redshifted to @xmath37 .",
    "the background galaxy also contributes continuum flux in the blue portion of the spectrum of 2mass 0755 + 2212 , filling in some of the alkali absorption features .",
    "the spectral features described above show clear trends with near - infrared spectral type : an increasing spectral slope and strengthening h@xmath0o absorption ; a peak in the cs i line strengths in the early-/mid - type t dwarfs ; loss of feh and crh absorptions at 8692 and 8611  in the early - type t dwarfs , and at 9896 and 9969  in the late - type t dwarfs ; and the possible emergence of ch@xmath1 at 8950  in the latest - type t dwarfs . hence , the makings of a spectral sequence in the red optical that parallels the near - infrared sequence are apparent .",
    "the low signal - to - noise in most of these spectra implies that a detailed scheme is generally not possible .",
    "we have therefore aimed at deriving a rough classification that parallels the near - infrared scheme , enabling a general comparison between near - infrared and optical spectral morphologies .",
    "we stress that our optical scheme is based entirely on red optical features , and that we have no _ a priori _ expectation that near - infrared and optical spectral morphologies must necessarily coincide .",
    "we have augmented our observed spectral data with t dwarf lris data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of the spectra in our full sample have therefore been acquired and reduced in an identical manner ( with the exception of telluric absorption correction ) and can therefore be reliably compared .",
    "our procedures for classification followed the basic tenets of the mk method @xcite .",
    "we chose four t dwarfs ",
    "sdss 1254@xmath30122 ( t2 ) , 2mass 0559@xmath31404 ( t5 ) , sdss 1624 + 0029 ( t6 ) , and 2mass 0415@xmath30935 ( t8 )  and the l8 2mass 1632 + 1904 @xcite as our spectral standards .",
    "three of the t dwarfs are near - infrared standards in the @xcite classification scheme , while sdss 1624 + 0029 replaces the t6 near - infrared standard 2mass 1225@xmath32739ab , which has been identified as an unequal - magnitude binary @xcite .",
    "note that the spectra of 2mass 1632 + 1904 and sdss 1624 + 0029 have not been corrected for telluric absorption . to improve the signal - to - noise of the spectra of sdss 1254@xmath30122 and 2mass 0415@xmath30935 , we combined our data with those of @xcite .",
    "we did not use the t1 and t3 near - infrared standards sdss 0837@xmath30000 and sdss 1021@xmath30304 because of their low signal - to - noise data .",
    "this choice leaves sdss 1254@xmath30122 as the only early - type t dwarf standard , so classifications between l8 and t5 are not intended to be robust ; see @xcite for a more detailed discussion on the optical spectra of early - type t dwarfs .",
    "we have nevertheless left placeholders for the unassigned intermediate subtypes ( t0 , t1 , t3 , t4 , and t7 ) to allow a consistent comparison with near - infrared classifications . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we hereafter designate near - infrared and optical classifications as t@xmath38 and t@xmath39 , respectively .",
    "all of the spectral standards are plotted together in figure 6 in both linear and logarithmic scales .",
    "the trends discussed above are readily apparent over this short sequence .",
    "more importantly , the various standards are clearly distinguishable , and hence represent distinct morphological classes .",
    "in other words , the selected standards would have been chosen to represent separate optical classes regardless of their near - infrared types .",
    "classification of the remaining spectra in our full sample was first done by visual comparison to the spectral standards .",
    "we have found that the optimal means of doing this is by comparison on a logarithmic scale ( e.g. , right panel in figure 6 ) .",
    "this method permits simultaneous examination of spectral slopes ranging over two orders of magnitude in flux density with weaker molecular and atomic features .",
    "we have made visual classifications for all objects with lris spectra previously typed t@xmath380 or later ; values are listed in table 7 .    in general , visual types for the t dwarfs correspond well with the near - infrared classifications , agreeing to within @xmath211 subtype for nearly every source .",
    "one exception is sdss 0423@xmath30414 , which has an earlier - type spectrum than our l8 standard ; @xcite , who classify this object as l7.5 in the optical , discusses this mismatch and its possible physical basis in detail .",
    "2mass 0937 + 2931 is assigned a peculiar visual classification because of its extreme red spectral slope , far in excess of any of the standards .",
    "we discuss this object in further detail in @xmath95.2 .      a more quantitative approach to classification is through the use of spectral indices , ratios of flux or flux density that measure the strengths of particular absorption or pseudo - continuum features .",
    "we examined the behavior of 20 indices sampling the cs i , feh , crh , h@xmath0o , and spectral slope features on our t dwarf spectra .",
    "some of these were taken from the literature and possibly modified @xcite , and some are of our own construction .",
    "the most useful indices are those that show the clearest trends and greatest contrast with spectral type in the standards .",
    "all of the indices were compared , and those that best satisfied these criteria were chosen .",
    "eight promising indices were identified , defined in table 5 .",
    "the cs i indices are essentially identical to those defined by @xcite , measuring the strengths of the 8521 and 8943  cs i lines , respectively .",
    "these indices appear to peak around t@xmath392 , then weaken toward the later subclasses , consistent with the behavior of the corresponding pews .",
    "the h@xmath0o index samples the 9250  band and may be weakly affected by telluric absorption , although it has been defined to avoid the strongest absorption longward of 9300  @xcite .",
    "this index increases dramatically beyond roughly t@xmath392 .",
    "the feh(a ) and crh(a ) indices measure the shorter wavelength bands of these molecules , which disappear around type t@xmath392 , after which the indices essentially measure a limited range of spectral slope .",
    "the feh(b ) and crh(b ) indices measure the longer wavelength bands , and show rather complex behavior , weakening in the late l and early t dwarfs , strengthening again in the mid - type t dwarfs , and finally weakening in the late t dwarfs .",
    "@xcite have proposed that this trend is attributable to the disruption of clouds across the l / t transition .",
    "their complex behavior limits the use of the feh(b ) and crh(b ) indices to spectral types t@xmath395 and later . finally , the color - e index measures the red spectral slope due to k i absorption , but is defined at longer wavelengths than the color - d @xcite or pc3 @xcite indices because of the absence of detectable flux shortward of 8000  in many of the spectra . this index is useful earlier than roughly t@xmath392",
    "( i.e. , around the l / t transition ) , but appears to saturate ( with considerable scatter ) in the mid- and late - type t dwarfs , possibly due to a turnover in the strength of the k i red wing ( however , see @xmath95.2 ) . taking into account similar behavior between pairs of indices and differing sensitivity for early and late t types ,",
    "we chose to use the csi(a ) , feh(b ) , color - e , and hybrid crh(a)/h@xmath0o ratios for our classification .",
    "these ratio values are plotted versus optical type in figure 7 .",
    "ratio values for the five spectral standards are listed in table 6 , and values for the remaining t dwarf spectra in our sample , as well as the associated standard types for each ratio , are listed in table 7 .",
    "final classifications were derived by averaging those ratio types ( feh(b ) was not used for types earlier than t@xmath395 , and color - e was not used for types later than t@xmath392 ) and rounding off to the nearest whole subclass .",
    "individual ratio types for each object agree within roughly one standard class .",
    "note that sdss 0837@xmath30000 and sdss 1021@xmath30304 are assigned uncertain classifications because of the substantial gaps between the nearest standard subclasses . with the exception of these two objects , all of our spectral ratio - derived classifications",
    "agree with our visually - derived classifications within one subclass , implying that our suite of indices accurately represent the overall spectral morphology .",
    "furthermore , there is excellent agreement between the optical ratio classifications and the near - infrared classifications , again with the singular exception of sdss 0423@xmath30414 .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that classification of mid- and late - type t dwarfs in the optical is feasible , either by visual comparison to the selected standards or through the use of spectral indices defined in table 5 . however , our scheme is only accurate to within one subclass , and is therefore not as precise as current near - infrared schemes .",
    "the behavior of the color - e and crh(a)/h@xmath0o indices also suggest that early - type t dwarfs may be delineated in the optical , suggesting that a clear segregation of l and t dwarfs at these wavelengths is possible .",
    "optical spectral observations of additional objects in this spectral type range will have to be made , however .",
    "we note that disagreement between the optical and near - infrared spectral morphologies of the key l / t transition object , sdss 0423@xmath30414 , does point to possible difficulties in this regime @xcite .",
    "the only object in our sample whose red optical spectrum is truly unique in comparison to the spectral standards is the t@xmath386p / t@xmath397p 2mass 0937 + 2931 .",
    "this object stands out in the near - infrared because of its enhanced cia h@xmath0 absorption ( resulting in a highly suppressed k - band peak ) and absence of the 1.25 @xmath5 k i lines , both of which point to a metal - poor and/or high gravity atmosphere @xcite . as noted in @xmath9 4.2 ,",
    "the optical spectrum is peculiar because of its strong spectral slope , also a consequence of low atmospheric metallicity and/or high surface gravity @xcite .    to examine the relative contribution of these secondary effects ,",
    "we have compared the spectrum of 2mass 0937 + 2931 to theoretical models from @xcite .",
    "these models do not incorporate the most recent line broadening theory of @xcite , nor do they include feh absorption , a relatively strong feature in the spectrum of 2mass 0937 + 2931 . nevertheless , as the current state of the art , they serve to illustrate general trends . as discussed in @xcite , increased surface gravity and decreased metallicity both result in a higher pressure photosphere , and hence enhancement of the pressure - sensitive k i and na i line wings .",
    "this effect is strong enough to overcome the reduced column depth and decreased chemical abundance resulting from a higher gravity or lower metallicity atmosphere , respectively , which tend to weaken other chemical features , such as the 9250  h@xmath0o band .",
    "decreased temperature also strengthens the na i and k i lines , but results in stronger h@xmath0o bands as well ( see @xmath9 5.2 ) .",
    "when we compare these trends to the optical spectrum of 2mass 0937 + 2931 ( figure 8) , it becomes clear that the relatively weak h@xmath0o band seen in these data requires a moderately high t@xmath8 , while the strong na i and k i require both a high gravity and low metallicity atmosphere .",
    "the best fitting models from @xcite , t@xmath8 = 800 and 1000 k , g = @xmath40 cm s@xmath41 , and @xmath42 are shown in figure 8 along with the observed spectrum .",
    "both models show somewhat stronger inner k i wings than the data , consistent with the analysis of @xcite that the line - broadening theory used in @xcite overestimates the line opacity by as much as a factor of 10 shortward of 9000  .",
    "nevertheless , the reasonable fit of the models to the data indicate a low metallicity , high gravity atmosphere for this object .",
    "note that the constraint on t@xmath8 is fairly weak ; a robust estimate could be obtained by measurement of this object s parallax .",
    "the substantial proper motion of 2mass 0937 + 2931 ( @xmath43 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2003a ) suggests that it is either quite close to the sun or has a high space velocity .",
    "@xcite have estimated a j - band spectrophotometric distance of roughly 9 pc , implying @xmath44 @xmath6 60 km s@xmath12 , which suggests ( but does not guarantee ) membership in the galactic thick disk or halo populations . such an object would have both a high surface gravity ( as it must be both old and therefore more massive for its temperature ) and a metal - deficient atmosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently identified an l - type metal - deficient dwarf which , like 2mass 0937 + 2931 , exhibits strong k i and metal hydride absorption , relatively blue near - infrared colors , and substantial space motion . determining whether 2mass 0937 + 2931 is a cool analog to this substellar subdwarf requires additional astrometric data and refined spectral models .",
    "nonetheless , the observed peculiarities in its optical and near - infrared spectra clearly indicate that 2mass 0937 + 2931 is a unique t dwarf requiring further investigation .      if we ignore metallicity variations ( i.e. , excluding 2mass 0937 + 2931 ) , then differences amongst the spectra in our sample are determined largely by temperature and gravity effects .",
    "the na i and k i resonant doublet lines , which generally dominate this spectral region , are highly sensitive to both parameters .",
    "so too is the 9250  h@xmath0o band .",
    "however , while the alkali lines strengthen with increasing gravity , h@xmath0o absorption decreases because of the reduced column depth of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the contrasting behavior of these features suggests that they may be used to distinguish temperature and gravity effects in t dwarf spectra . as our sample likely includes objects with ages of roughly 15 gyr ( assuming they are drawn from the galactic disk population ; reid & hawley 2000 ) and 700 @xmath10 t@xmath8 @xmath10 1200 k @xcite , and hence surface gravities ( @xmath45 ) spanning the range @xmath46 cm s@xmath41 @xcite , demonstrative gravity effects may be present .    as noted in @xmath9 4.3 , the color - e index ( which measure the k i red wing ) shows substantial scatter with optical spectral type for classes later than t@xmath392 ( figure 7d ) , while the combined crh(a)/h@xmath0o index is reasonably monotonic over this region .",
    "figure 9 compares the color - e and crh(a)/h@xmath0o indices for all of our telluric - calibrated spectra .",
    "the general trends with t@xmath8 and gravity are noted at the bottom , derived by measuring the indices on the spectral models of @xcite . for crh(a)/h@xmath0o",
    "@xmath10 0.7 ( spt @xmath47 t@xmath392 ) , there is a clear spread in the color - e values , with 2mass 0937 + 2931 being the most significant outlier .",
    "the simplest explanation for this divergence is intrinsic scatter in the indices , due to perhaps poor signal - to - noise in some of the spectra .",
    "however , we note two suggestive trends .",
    "first , the four objects with h@xmath2 emission ( including sdss 0423@xmath30414 ; kirkpatrick et al .  2003 ) generally have steeper spectral slopes ( larger color - e ) than other objects with similar crh(a)/h@xmath0o values . @xcite",
    "have noted that for late - type m and l field dwarfs , h@xmath2 emission is generally found amongst the older , and hence more massive , objects .",
    "if this relation follows through into the t dwarf regime , then we expect the active objects to have higher surface gravities , and therefore systematically larger color - e ratios .",
    "second , one object in our sample has an independent age , and hence gravity , determination , the companion t@xmath388/t@xmath397 gliese 570d @xcite . at 25 gyr",
    ", this brown dwarf has a surface gravity of ( 12)@xmath48 cm s@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "below this object is the t@xmath387.5/t@xmath397 2mass 1217@xmath30311 @xcite , which @xcite have suggested may be a low - gravity t dwarf based on its somewhat brighter k - band peak ( implying weaker cia h@xmath0 absorption ) .",
    "again , the relative positions of these sources in figure 9 are consistent with the expected trends .",
    "these examples suggest that temperature- and gravity - based features could be disentangled , enabling a means of resolving the brown dwarf age / mass / temperature degeneracy . independent age and/or gravity information ( e.g. , kinematics , companionship to well - studied stars , or cluster membership ) or improved spectral models are needed to verify and calibrate these potentially useful diagnostics .",
    "one of our motivations for deriving a classification scheme for t dwarfs in the optical is to compare the evolution of spectral morphology between optical and near - infrared wavelengths . for this discussion ,",
    "we focus on the mid- and late - type t dwarfs , t@xmath385/t@xmath395 and later . as discussed above , classifications for these objects in the two wavelength regimes considered here are remarkably consistent , implying a coherent evolution of features over 0.62.5 @xmath5 with spectral type",
    ". this may be somewhat surprising , given the competing temperature and gravity dependencies of defining h@xmath0o and ch@xmath1 bands @xcite and k i and na i resonance line wings @xcite , the relatively weak gravity dependence of the optical cs i lines @xcite , and the strong gravity dependence of cia h@xmath0 in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "it may be the case that , despite the wide range of possible surface gravities in our sample , these particular t dwarfs have fairly similar masses and ages and hence little variation in @xmath45 .",
    "such a case would imply that temperature is the @xmath49 discriminant in current t dwarf classification schemes .",
    "however , the suggestive trends noted in the previous section do point to separable gravity / temperature diagnostics being present within our sample , and hence a non - negligible range of surface gravities .",
    "this possibility leads us to consider that competing gravity and temperature effects may compensate for each other amongst all of the optical and near - infrared diagnostic spectral features , and that t subtypes in either regime may not in fact map directly onto a temperature scale .",
    "the latter point is an important problem , as classifications are commonly used as proxies for t@xmath8 and luminosity in population studies .",
    "our results indicate that comparing optical and near - infrared morphologies can not , at the precision of our near - infrared and optical classifications , resolve dependencies between gravity and temperature in the spectra of mid- and late - type t dwarfs .",
    "however , developing the spectral diagnostics described in previous section may lead to a two - dimensional system that could be tied directly to temperature and gravity scales .",
    "the agreement between optical and near - infrared classifications for mid- and late - type t dwarfs also suggests that two possible causes for disagreements amongst late - type l and early - type t dwarf classifications  condensate cloud opacity and/or duplicity @xcite  may not be important for later - type t dwarfs .",
    "in general , t dwarf spectra and photometry are well - matched to models without condensate cloud opacity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* however , see marley et al .",
    "2002 ; burrows et al .",
    "2002a ) , although low - level near - infrared photometric @xcite and spectroscopic @xcite variability , attributed to condensate clouds , has been observed in some t dwarfs .",
    "these time - dependent variations are typically quite small , however , and do not significantly change the overall spectral morphology @xcite . as for duplicity ,",
    "later - type t dwarf doubles are not affected by the substantial redistribution of spectral flux that occurs across the l / t transition @xcite , which allows a late - type l dwarf to dominate optical emission while its early - type t dwarf companion dominates near - infrared emission .",
    "this scenario may explain the presence of ch@xmath1 at 2.2 @xmath5 in the l6.5 unequal - magnitude binary 2mass 0920 + 3517ab @xcite , as well as the near - infrared / optical classification discrepancy for sdss 0423@xmath30414 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , both of the known binaries in our sample , 2mass 1225@xmath32739ab and 2mass 1534@xmath32952ab @xcite , have essentially identical optical and near - infrared types .",
    "it is important to consider , however , that a larger , and perhaps time - resolved , optical sample is required to rigorously examine the influence of variability and duplicity on differences between optical and near - infrared t dwarf spectra .",
    "we have examined lris red optical spectra for a sample of t dwarfs .",
    "these spectra are largely dominated by pressure - broadened na i and k i features , which are highly sensitive to temperature , gravity , and metallicity .",
    "weaker lines of cs i and rb i are also present , and appear to follow the trends of current chemical equilibrium calculations .",
    "molecular bands of h@xmath0o , cah , crh , feh , and possibly ch@xmath1 are also present .",
    "h@xmath2 emission is seen in three objects , weakly in sdss 1254@xmath30122 and 2mass 1047 + 2124 , but strong in the active t dwarf 2mass 1237 + 6526 .",
    "none of the spectra exhibit the 6708  li i line , consistent with chemical depletion of this atomic species for t @xmath10 1500 k. trends in the observed strengths of these features have allowed us to define a classification scheme in the red optical , accurate to within one subclass . tying our scheme to selected near - infrared spectral standards , we are able to make a consistent comparison between optical and near - infrared types , and hence a critical examination of spectral morphologies in these two spectral regions .",
    "we find excellent agreement between these classifications amongst the mid- and late - type t dwarfs , suggesting that either current classification schemes are largely temperature - based , or that temperature and gravity effects compensate for each other throughout the 0.62.5 @xmath5 region .",
    "disentangling these physical parameters may be possible by comparing the strength of the k i red wing and the 9250  h@xmath0o band , potentially leading to a two - dimensional classification system that can be mapped onto temperature and gravity scales .",
    "both gravity and metallicity effects help explain the peculiar spectrum of 2mass 0937 + 2931 , which may be an old , massive , and slightly metal - poor thick disk or halo brown dwarf . further astrometric data and improved spectral models will enable a more rigorous characterization of this unique brown dwarf . clearly ,",
    "while very little of the total luminosity of t dwarfs is emitted shortward of 1 @xmath5 , there are an abundance of diagnostics present in this spectral region that can be used to examine the physics of these cool brown dwarfs .",
