    "<S> the interactions of axions and similar light pseudoscalars with standard model particles are model dependent , i.e. not a function of @xmath8 only </S>",
    "<S> . the most stringent constraints to date come from their coupling to photons , @xmath9 , which arises via the axial anomaly , @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the ( dual ) electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath13 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath14 is the ratio of electromagnetic over color anomalies , a model - dependent ratio of order one . as illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the microwave cavity experiments aim at axion detection under the assumption that axions are the galactic dark matter  @xcite , the telescope search looks for axions thermally produced in galaxy clusters  @xcite , and the solar - magnetic  @xcite and solar - germanium  @xcite experiments search for axions from the sun . the constraint from helium burning ( hb ) stars arises from a consideration of the energy losses associated with axion production and the corresponding influence on stellar evolution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that two quite distinct invisible axion models , namely the ksvz  @xcite ( or hadronic ) and the dfsz  @xcite ( or grand unified ) one , lead to quite similar axion - photon couplings . </S>",

    "<S> the most straightforward and direct proposal is to set up a photon regeneration experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it may be based on the idea  @xcite to send a polarized laser beam , with average power @xmath15 and frequency @xmath16 , along a superconducting dipole magnet of length @xmath17 , such that the laser polarization is parallel to the magnetic field ( @xmath18 ) . in this external magnetic field </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : hera],width=291 ]    although it sounds , at first sight , quite unrealistic to achieve these benchmark parameters in the foreseeable future , there is , indeed , a quite realistic opportunity even to surpass them : in the not so far distant future , possibly already by the end of @xmath44 , the electron positron collider hera at desy in hamburg ( cf . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hera ] ) will be decommissioned and the @xmath45 superconducting dipole magnets , each of which achieving @xmath46  t and having a length of @xmath47  m , can , in principle , be recycled and used for a photon regeneration experiment . </S>",
    "<S> one may envisage to employ @xmath48 of those magnets aligned along one of the four straight sections of hera ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hera ] ) , to supply a magnetic field of @xmath49  t over a linear extension of @xmath50  m. with such an arrangement one will be able to reach a sensitivity of @xmath51  gev@xmath40 for @xmath52  ev ( labelled `` laser in hera tunnel '' in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ax_ph ] ) , which is unprecedented in pure laboratory experiments , similar to the limit from stellar evolution , and competes with the designed sensitivity of the cern axion solar telescope cast  @xcite , @xmath53 gev@xmath40 for @xmath54  ev , which looks for axions from the sun .    in a later stage </S>",
    "<S> , one may think on deploying all @xmath55 decommissioned hera dipole magnets ( @xmath56  m ) in the @xmath57  km long tesla xfel tunnel at desy , in which after @xmath58 a superconducting linear accelerator will run to provide high - quality electron bunches for the x - ray free electron lasers ( xfels ) in a dedicated laboratory  @xcite ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xfel_camp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding sensitivity , @xmath59  gev@xmath40 for @xmath60  ev ( labelled `` laser in xfel tunnel '' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_ph ] ) , has so far been only probed by microwave cavity searches for axions , under the assumption that they are the dominant part of the galactic cold dark matter ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_ph ] ) .    both proposals , the first stage photon regeneration experiment in the hera tunnel and the second stage in the tesla xfel tunnel , share the advantage that the necessary infrastructure for running superconducting dipole magnets is already available at these sites . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of both proposals , however , still does not extend to larger axion masses . correspondingly , standard axion couplings ( labelled `` ksvz '' and `` dfsz '' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_ph ] ) are beyond the reach of them . in order to probe larger axion masses , </S>",
    "<S> one may segment the @xmath61 aligned dipole magnets into @xmath62 subgroups of alternating polarity  @xcite such that the appropriate form factor , @xmath63 peaks at a nonzero value of @xmath64 , thereby giving sensitivity to higher - mass ( pseudo-)scalars . </S>",
    "<S> with such an arrangement one may gain up to an order of magnitude in mass  still remaining , however , below standard axion values .    </S>",
    "<S> even larger axion masses may in principle be probed by the usage of the photon beam from one of the future x - ray free electron lasers ( @xmath65  kev in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ax_coh ] ) ) instead of the one from an optical laser ( @xmath65  ev )  @xcite . however , the poor longitudinal coherence of the first generation xfel beams limits the immediate prospects of their application to axion production in an external magnetic field . they will have a longitudinal coherence length @xmath66  @xmath67 m  @xcite which is much less than the linear extension of the magnetic field @xmath68  m. under such circumstances , the expected counting rate  ( [ eq : ax_counting_rate ] ) , which tacitly assumes @xmath69 , diminishes by a factor @xmath70 and , correspondingly , the sensitivity  ( [ sensit ] ) gets worse by a factor @xmath71  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , exploiting the photon beam from the 2-stage sase 2 xfel in the tesla xfel laboratory  @xcite , with @xmath72  @xmath67 m , @xmath73  kev , @xmath74  w , and @xmath75 , one obtains , for @xmath46 t and @xmath76  km , a sensitivity of @xmath77  gev@xmath40 , for @xmath78  ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is even worse than the current limit from the above mentioned pilot photon regeneration experiment ( cf . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_ph ] ) , but extends of course to higher masses . </S>",
    "<S> competitive limits from the usage of xfels can only be expected if their longitudinal coherence can be substantially improved in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> a similar combination of lasers with massive linear arrangements of recycled hera dipole magnets , but without a separating wall in the middle , might be used for the search for polarization effects induced by real and virtual axion production  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , axion production affects the polarization of laser light propagating in an external magnetic field in two ways ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) : the polarization vector of initially linearly polarized light will be rotated by an angle @xmath79 and emerge with an elliptical polarization @xmath80 , @xmath81 \\label{ax_ell } \\psi_a & = & \\frac{n_r}{2}\\,\\frac{g_{a\\gamma}^2\\,b^2\\,\\omega^2}{m_a^4}\\ , \\left [ \\frac{m_a^2\\,\\ell}{2\\,\\omega } - \\sin \\left ( \\frac{m_a^2\\,\\ell}{2\\,\\omega}\\right ) \\right]\\ , \\sin 2\\,\\theta \\approx   \\frac{n_r}{96}\\,\\left ( g_{a\\gamma}\\,b\\,\\ell \\right)^2\\ , \\frac{m_a^2\\,\\ell}{\\omega}\\ , \\sin 2\\,\\theta \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the angle between the light polarization direction and the magnetic field component normal to the light propagation vector . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by measuring both @xmath79 and @xmath80 , one can determine the mass and the coupling of the pseudoscalar  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ellipticity due to light - by - light scattering in qed is much stronger than the one from axions , but calculable , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the electron mass .    </S>",
    "<S> a pioneering polarization experiment along these lines has been performed with the same laser and magnets described above exploited for the pilot photon regeneration experiment  @xcite . for @xmath85  m , @xmath86  t , and @xmath87 , an upper limit on the rotation angle @xmath88  rad was set , leading to a limit @xmath89  gev@xmath40 at the 95% confidence level , provided @xmath41  ev . </S>",
    "<S> similar limits have been set from the absence of ellipticity in the transmitted beam and labelled by `` laser '' . ] .    the currently running pvlas experiment  @xcite , consisting of a fabry - prot cavity of very high finesse ( @xmath90 ) immersed in an intense magnetic dipole with @xmath91  m and @xmath92  t , will improve these bounds on @xmath9 by a factor of @xmath93 , as can be easily seen from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ax_rot ] ) and ( [ ax_ell ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a polarization experiment in the hera tunnel , using @xmath94 of the hera dipole magnets , is expected to improve the current limit on @xmath79 by a factor of @xmath95 to @xmath96  gev@xmath40 , for small @xmath97 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ax_coh ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it seems that only with considerable efforts , in particular with respect to the improvement of the finesse of the cavity , a polarization experiment in the hera tunnel can reach a sensitivity to the axion - photon coupling which is comparable to the one obtainable in a photon regeneration experiment of similar size in @xmath98 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> even a state - of - the - art ( @xmath99 ) second stage polarization experiment in the tesla xfel tunnel can reach only a sensitivity of @xmath100  gev@xmath40 for small axion masses .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that in the not so far distant future , when hera has been decommissioned , there arises a unique opportunity for searches for light neutral ( pseudo-)scalars by recycling a number of hera s superconducting dipole magnets and using them for laser experiments exploiting photon regeneration or polarization . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments may reach a sensitivity in the coupling of the ( pseudo-)scalar to two photons which is unprecedented in pure laboratory experiments and exceeds , for small masses , astrophysical and cosmological limits . </S>"
