    "theoretical studies of reaction  ( [ eq : mucap ] ) have been carried out within two different frameworks : the so - called elementary particle method(epm ) and the fully microscopic approach .",
    "the epm , first developed by kim and primakoff  @xcite , is essentially a phenomenological approach , which parameterizes the nuclear ( charge - changing ) weak current in terms of the trinucleon form factors , in analogy to the nucleon weak current , and then attempts to derive these from other experiments . within the epm",
    ", it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , if the hyperfine structure of the @xmath16he system is taken into account and the direction of the recoiling triton can be detected , there are , in addition to the capture rate , other observables , i.e. angular correlation parameters , which are more sensitive than the capture rate itself to the value of the nucleon pseudo - scalar axial coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the possibility of determining @xmath6 from measurements of muon capture observables is one of the motivations for the interest that this process has generated over the years .",
    "recently , one attempt has been made to measure the angular correlation parameter @xmath12  @xcite , though the experimental result , which to our knowledge represents the first significant measurement of this observable , is affected by large systematic uncertainties .",
    "therefore , a comparison between theory and experiment will not be particularly meaningful for @xmath12 .",
    "experimental results with an improved accuracy are highly desirable .    in contrast , the fully microscopic approach is based on : i ) @xmath0h and @xmath0he wave functions as accurate as possible , to reduce uncertainties related to nuclear structure ; ii ) a realistic model for the nuclear weak current and charge operators . the first microscopic calculation of reaction  ( [ eq : mucap ] ) was performed by peterson in 1968  @xcite , and was reconsidered and improved by phillips and collaborators in 1974  @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , used nuclear wave functions which were approximate , and retained in the nuclear weak transition operators only single - nucleon terms , the impulse approximation ( ia ) .    in the early nineties , the muon capture on @xmath0he , including the total rate and angular correlation parameters mentioned above ,",

    "@xcite , where a model for two - body components in the nuclear weak current was explicitly constructed .",
    "the calculated capture rate is in good agreement with the measured value , although the theoretical prediction suffers from a 2 % uncertainty , which is rather large compared to the experimental error , and mostly arises from poor knowledge of some of the coupling constants and cutoff parameters entering the axial current .",
    "the present work sharpens and updates that of ref .",
    "improvements in the modeling of two- and three - nucleon interactions and the nuclear weak current make the re - examination of process  ( [ eq : mucap ] ) especially timely .",

    "@xcite , however , and to have some estimate of the model dependence of the results , the older argonne @xmath3 two - nucleon and tucson - melbourne three - nucleon interaction models have also been used .",
    "both these hamiltonians reproduce the experimental binding energies and charge radii of the trinucleon systems .",
    "the model for the nuclear weak current used in the present work has been developed in refs .",

    "@xcite and also from sec .",

    "@xcite is slightly different from that given here in table  [ tb : ga ] , since that value was obtained from a random walk consisting of 100,000 configurations , while the number of configurations sampled in the present work is 150,000 .",
    "] . however , the results for the observables calculated consistently within the two different schemes are typically within 1 % of each other .",
    "second , because of the procedure adopted to determine @xmath138 , the coupling constant @xmath23=@xmath140 can not be naively interpreted as the @xmath22@xmath5 axial coupling constant .",
    "the excitation of additional resonances and their associated contributions will contaminate the value of @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , the pcac arguments used above imply @xmath141=@xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the @xmath28@xmath22@xmath22 and @xmath28@xmath22@xmath5 coupling constants , and therefore one would obtain on the basis of table  [ tb : ga ] that @xmath145 is in the range 1.081.56 , smaller than the value inferred from the @xmath5 width , 4.67 , and even smaller than the quark - model prediction , 2.88 .",
    "in this section results for the @xmath0he(@xmath1 , @xmath2)@xmath0h capture process are reported .",

    "a similar relation holds between the electromagnetic charge operator and its weak vector counterpart .",
    "thus , if @xmath0he and @xmath0h were truly members of an isospin doublet , then the @xmath92 and @xmath97 rme s would just be proportional to the isovector combination of the trinucleon charge and magnetic form factors .",

    "lastly , from inspection of table  [ tb : mecc ] , it is interesting to note that the contribution @xmath28a from the pion - exchange axial charge operator , which would be expected to be dominant among the two - body contributions to @xmath93 , is also negligible .",
    "in fact , the operator structure of the corresponding @xmath93 multipole is such that it can not connect the dominant s - wave components in the @xmath0he and @xmath0h wave functions , and the associated matrix element is therefore highly suppressed .",

    "@xcite are slightly different from those adopted in the present work .",
    "it is important to emphasize , though , that the present model for the weak current reproduces well the available experimental data : i ) the isovector component of the electromagnetic current , which by cvc is related to the weak vector current , leads to predictions for the isovector combination of the charge and magnetic form factors of @xmath0he and @xmath0h in excellent agreement with the measured values  @xcite up to momentum transfer of @xmath169 fm@xmath11 ; ii ) the two - body axial current operators are constrained to reproduce the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath8-decay .    to test the sensitivity of all the muon capture observables to the induced pseudo - scalar form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , eqs .",

    ". a precise measurement of these polarization observables could therefore be useful to ascertain the extent to which the induced pseudo - scalar form factors deviate from their pcac values .    finally , by enforcing perfect agreement between the experimental and theoretical values , taken with their uncertainties , for the total capture rate @xmath106 , it is possible to obtain an estimate for the range of values allowed for @xmath174 .",
    "the procedure adopted is the following : i ) we have considered the av18/uix minimum and maximum value for @xmath106 ( see table  [ tb : gapm ] ) , obtained with @xmath174=1 and @xmath138=1.08 and 1.26 , respectively ( see table  [ tb : ga ] ) .",

    "the conserved - vector - current hypothesis has been used to derive the weak vector charge and current operators from the isovector electromagnetic counterparts , while the axial current has been constructed to reproduce the measured gamow - teller matrix element of @xmath0h @xmath8-decay .",

    "the predicted total capture rate is in agreement with the experimental value , and has been found to have only a weak model dependence : the av18/uix and av14/tm results differ by less than 0.5 % .",
    "the weak model dependence can be traced back to the fact that both hamiltonians reproduce the binding energies , charge and magnetic radii of the trinucleons , and the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath8-decay .",
    "it is important to note that , if the contributions associated with two - body terms in the axial current were to be neglected , the predicted capture rate would be 1316 ( 1318 ) sec@xmath11 with av18/uix ( av14/tm ) , and so two - body mechanisms are crucial for reproducing the experimental value .",
    "the present work demonstrates that the procedure adopted for constraining these two - body contributions leads to a consistent description of available experimental data on weak transitions in the three - body systems .",
    "it also corroborates the robustness of our recent predictions for the cross sections of the proton weak captures on @xmath24h  @xcite and @xmath0he  @xcite , which were obtained with the same model for the nuclear weak current .",
