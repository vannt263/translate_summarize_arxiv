    "the swift gamma - ray burst satellite  @xcite was successfully launched on 2004 november 20 . since then",
    ", it has provided observations and positions of grbs and their afterglows to observers and robotic telescopes typically within a minute , thanks to its three instruments : the wide - field burst alert telescope  @xcite and the two narrow - field instruments , x - ray telescope  @xcite and uv / optical telescope  @xcite .",
    "when a grb is detected by the bat and a slew is possible , swift automatically re - points to bring the burst within the field of view of the xrt and the uvot .",
    "the xrt uses a grazing incidence wolter-1 telescope consisting of a thermally controlled carbon fibre telescope tube , an x - ray mirror system of 12 concentric gold - coated electroformed ni shells with a 3.5 m focal length , and a focal plane camera assembly ( fpca ) housing an e2v ccd-22 with @xmath0 image pixels , located behind an optical blocking filter with an optical transmission of about @xmath1 .",
    "the ccd is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler connected via a heat pipe to an external radiator .",
    "the fpca also includes an autonomous sun shutter , four @xmath2fe calibration sources and a substantial mass of al proton shielding ( which also reduces thermal variations ) . to avoid the effects of pile - up ,",
    "the xrt is able to autonomously select one of the three following readout modes  @xcite according to the source brightness : photo - diode ( pd ) mode at highest count rates with a 0.14 ms time resolution and no spatial information ; windowed timing ( wt ) mode at moderate count rates with a 1.8 ms time resolution and 1-d spatial information ; at lower count rates photon counting mode ( pc ) with a 2.5 s time resolution and 2-d spatial information .    during the first year in orbit two major incidents occurred which required modification of the instrument s operation , although they have not affected its scientific productivity .",
    "first , before the ccd was cooled to its nominal operating temperature of @xmath3c , the xrt thermo - cooler ( tec ) power supply system apparently failed , and therefore the xrt has to rely on passive cooling via the heat pipe and radiator in combination with enhanced management of the spacecraft orientation to reduce the radiator view of the sunlit earth . in flight the xrt is nowadays operated with ccd temperatures of -75 to -52@xmath4c ( see kennea et al .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "secondly , on 2005 may 27 the xrt was hit by a particle ( micro - meteoroid ) which scattered off the mirror system to hit several ccd pixels , causing new bright pixels , one bright column and two bright column segments  @xcite .",
    "charge leakage from the top of the bright column affects its immediate neighbours .",
    "the evolution of charge leakage depends on the ccd temperature which can now only be controlled by orientation of the spacecraft . after this event",
    ", the optical filter showed no sign of damage .",
    "similar events were also observed in the xmm - newton epic mos ccds .",
    "the bright pixels and columns have been vetoed on - board for the pc and wt modes .",
    "this is impossible in pd mode so that mode is no longer used , which had the beneficial effect of reducing the ccd temperature .",
    "these two incidents had no direct impact on the spectroscopic performance of the xrt , or its ability to image and locate new grbs .",
    "indeed , the xrt routinely measures the early x - ray light - curves and spectra of all the grb afterglows at which it is promptly pointed ( hence @xmath5 of the 183 grbs detected by the bat for which a spacecraft slew was possible within 5 minutes after the bat trigger were detected by the xrt up until the middle of july 2007 ; the bat has detected a total of 243 grbs up until the middle of july 2007 ) .",
    "these observations have revealed previously unexpected multiple breaks  @xcite and flares in the early x - ray light - curves  @xcite suggesting extended activity of the central engine up to @xmath6 s after the trigger for long and short grbs ; which challenges the current progenitor models .",
    "essential spectral and temporal information was also obtained with the xrt for the peculiar event grb 060218 showing for the first time the rise of a supernova  @xcite .",
    "the xrt has also discovered the first short burst afterglow  @xcite and provided accurate locations of several short grbs , which are associated with elliptical galaxies or star - forming galaxies , the burst being located in the outskirts of the galaxy in the latter case ; these results tend to indicate that short grbs are likely to be due to binary compact object spiral - in and collision  @xcite .",
    "the xrt also provides essential information for non - grb targets , for example with the follow - up of the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi  @xcite or the micro - quasar gro j1655 - 40  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of time spent on non - grb targets ( excluding the calibration targets ) is @xmath7 since the launch , and this is expected to increase over time .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the xrt ccd in - flight spectral calibration , and describe recent improvements to the response model made available as response matrices through the heasarc caldb ( rmf version 009  @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained during the pre - flight calibration were covered in osborne et al .",
    ".summary of the in - flight calibration targets used up to july 2007 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we showed that our monte - carlo code computing the pc and wt rmfs allows us to describe the ccd response well .",
    "thus , the v009 rmf files release in july 2007 allow a better modelling of the low - energy shelf of heavily absorbed sources and a better physical description of the origin of the shoulder from photons above 1.5 kev .",
    "we also showed that energy scale offsets due to corruption of the bias level in both pc and wt modes can limit the improvements of the instrument spectral response , especially at low energies .",
    "new tool xrtpcbias and the new command option wtbiasdiff have been provided by the xrt software team to correct the bias level in both pc and wt mode , and hence suppress energy scale offset .",
    "these tools are included in the 2.7 xrt software package recently released .",
    "we are working on a more complete trap characterisation .",
    "to do so , the xrt began observing the snr cas a for 80ks in pc mode and 50ks for wt .",
    "because of the development of traps with time in the ccd detector , we also outline the importance to use an on - board calibration source which fully illuminates the focal plane , for instance as used on - board xmm - newton , for future x - ray ccd instruments .",
    "finally , in order to improve further the xrt spectral performance , we plan to raise permanently the substrate voltage to @xmath8v on - board before the end of 2007 .",
    "an intense phase of re - calibration of the instrument will shortly follow to update the spectral response files , the gain file and the ground data processing software .",
