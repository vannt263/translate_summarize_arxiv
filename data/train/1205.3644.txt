    "determining the properties of clusters of galaxies such as their total and baryonic mass offers an independent and powerful cosmological tool to constrain the parameters of the @xmath2 model .",
    "the mass distribution of clusters is usually measured using a variety of observational methods , including x - ray , sunyaev zeldovich ( sz)(sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ; birkinshaw 1999 ; calrstrom , holder & reese 2002 ) , and gravitational lensing analyses .",
    "these methods are often based on parameterised cluster models for the distribution of the cluster dark matter and the thermodynamical properties of its intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "however , these various approaches usually lead to different estimates of the cluster mass .",
    "this is due to either extrapolating to halo masses and to redshifts that are not well sampled by the data or fitting for model parameters to which the data are insensitive .    in this letter",
    ", we perform a detailed analysis of a sample of nine simulated sz observations of galaxy clusters in a mass range of @xmath3 at redshift @xmath4 as if observed with arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) ( ami consortium : zwart et  al .",
    "to study the cluster total mass , we use the model described in olamaie et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which has the following main characteristic features : ( 1 ) host halo density profile follows a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) ( navarro et  al .",
    "1997 ) profile and the gas pressure is described by a generalised nfw ( gnfw ) profile ( nagai et  al .",
    "2007 ) with fixed shape parameters , both in accordance with numerical simulations ; ( 2 ) the gas distribution is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the cluster total gravitational potential dominated by dark matter and both dark matter and gas are spherically symmetric ; and ( 3 ) the local gas fraction is much less than unity throughout the cluster , i.e. @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "this final assumption allows us to write @xmath7 .",
    "we show that assuming the dark matter halo concentration parameter as an independent free parameter in the analysis has the potential to introduce biases in the cluster mass estimate , and hence it is crucial to consider the mass and redshift dependency of this parameter in the analysis . throughout",
    ", we assume a @xmath8 cosmology with @xmath9 .",
    "as the sz surface brightness is proportional to the line - of - sight integral of the pressure of the hot plasma in the icm , sz analysis of galaxy clusters provides a direct measurement of the pressure distribution of the icm .",
    "the observed sz surface brightness in the direction of electron reservoir may be described as @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the blackbody spectrum , @xmath12  k ( fixsen et  al . 1996 ) is the temperature of the cmb radiation , @xmath13 is the frequency dependence of thermal sz signal , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is planck s constant , @xmath16 is the frequency and @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "@xmath18 takes into account the relativistic corrections due to the relativistic thermal electrons in the icm and is derived by solving the kompaneets equation up to the higher orders ( rephaeli  1995 , itoh et  al .",
    "1998 , nozawa et  al .",
    "1998 , pointecouteau et  al . 1998 and",
    "challinor and lasenby 1998 ) .",
    "it should be noted that at 15 ghz ( ami observing frequency ) @xmath19 and therefore the relativistic correction , as shown by rephaeli ( 1995 ) , is negligible for @xmath20 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 , known as the comptonization parameter , is the integral of the number of collisions multiplied by the mean fractional energy change of photons per collision , along the line of sight @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electron number density , pressure and temperature at radius @xmath6 respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath27 is the electron mass , @xmath28 is the speed of light and @xmath29 is the line element along the line of sight .",
    "it should be noted that in equation  ( [ eq : ypar ] ) we have used the ideal gas equation of state .    moreover , the integral of the comptonization @xmath21 parameter over the solid angle @xmath30 subtended by the cluster ( @xmath31 ) is proportional to the volume integral of the gas pressure .",
    "it is thus a good estimate for the total thermal energy content of the cluster and hence its mass ( see e.g. bartlett & silk 1994 ) . the @xmath31 parameter in both cylindrical and spherical geometries may be described as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the projected radius of the cluster on the sky .    in this context",
    "we use the model described in olamaie et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , with its corresponding assumptions on the dynamical state of the icm , to model the sz signal and determine the radial profiles of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for nine simulated clusters .",
    "the model assumes that the the dark matter density follows a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) profile ( navarro et  al .",
    "1997 ) and the icm plasma pressure is described by the generalised nfw ( gnfw ) profile ( nagai et  al .",
    "2007 ) , @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an overall normalisation coefficient , @xmath39 is the scale radius where the logarithmic slope of the profile @xmath40 , @xmath41 is also an overall normalisation coefficient of the pressure profile and @xmath42 is the scale radius .",
    "it is common to define the latter in terms of @xmath43 , the radius at which the mean enclosed density is 500 times the critical density at the cluster redshift , and the gas concentration parameter , @xmath44 .",
    "the parameters @xmath45 describe the slopes of the pressure profile at @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . in the simplest case , we follow arnaud et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) and fix the values of the gas concentration parameter and the slopes to be @xmath49 .",
    "it is also common practice to define the halo concentration parameter , @xmath50 , where @xmath1 is the radius at which the enclosed mean density is @xmath51 times the critical density at the cluster redshift .",
    "the cluster model parameters : @xmath52 , @xmath39 and @xmath53 and hence the pressure and the integrated mass distributions may be derived under the following assumptions : spherical symmetry ; hydrostatic equilibrium ; and that the local gas fraction is much less than unity , equations ( 3 ) to ( 11 ) in olamaie et  al .",
    "it should be noted that in olamaie et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we considered the halo concentration parameter , @xmath54 as an input free parameter and studied the cluster profiles for a distribution of concentrations at a given mass and redshift .",
    "however , the results of our analysis showed that @xmath54 remains unconstrained .",
    "@xmath54 is a physical parameter , which reflects the background density of the universe , and so is not a parameter that just defines the shape or the slope of the profile that can not be constrained by sz only analysis of galaxy clusters .",
    "this therefore suggests that the concentration depends on the other physical sampling parameters for a given set of cosmological parameters , i.e. , mass and redshift .",
    "hence , in this letter , we consider such a dependency in our analysis and instead derive @xmath54 .",
    "we also note that the results of the studies on the relation between the structural properties of the dark matter halos such as concentration , spin and shape with mass and the redshift from both @xmath55- body simulations of cosmological structure formation in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe and observations of clusters of galaxies show a clear dependence of the concentration parameter on the halo mass and its redshift .",
    "this is based on the fact , as first discussed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ) and ( 1997 ) , that the concentration parameter reflects the background density of the universe at its formation time and hence as small objects form first in a hierarchical universe , lower mass halos will be more concentrated than the massive ones ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; eke et  al . 2001 ; bullock et  al .",

    "moreover , all of these studies show that the concentration - mass relation is well fitted by a power law over the mass range @xmath56 .",
    "however , studies on determining the normalisation coefficient and the slope of such relation are still ongoing , and in particular , cluster observations have yet to investigate this further . in this letter , we , therefore , decided to use the relation derived by neto et  al . ( 2007 ) from @xmath55-body simulation which has also been used by corless et  al .",

    "this result , as we have seen in our previous studies of clusters of galaxies ( ami consortium : olamaie et  al .",

    "the difference in estimating the cluster mass and its gas pressure using two forms of parameterizations is clear and becomes more significant as @xmath64 increases .",

    "we have studied the recovery of @xmath73 and @xmath24 from the sz effect for a sample of nine simulated galaxy clusters ( @xmath74 ) using the model described in olamaie et  al .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that sz surface brightness is proportional to the line of sight integral of the icm plasma so that sz data can potentially constrain the cluster total mass .    to obtain an unbiased mass estimate we have carried out a detailed analysis of a series of simulated clusters using two different parameterizations within our model and its corresponding assumptions ( olamaie et  al .",

    "we assume that the halo concentration parameter @xmath54 is also a sampling parameter .",
    "however , the results of the analysis show that the simulated sz data can not constrain this parameter and therefore its mean value is driven by the prior range which may introduce biases in the ultimate cluster mass estimate .",
    "this results also suggests that @xmath54 depends on the other model parameters .    in the second parameterization we consider the correlation of @xmath54 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 within @xmath2 universe ( equation [ eq : c200m200 ] ) as higher mass halos that are forming today are less concentrated than halos of lower mass that built up at an earlier epoch , where the mean density was higher .",
    "this parameterization clearly constrains @xmath54 as ami sz data can constrain @xmath59 .",
