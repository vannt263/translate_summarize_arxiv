    "in this section we compare the expected oscillation periods of magnetic field sweeps for abelian and non - abelian candidate states at @xmath0 . as explained in the main text , the net phase accumulation in a quantum hall interferometer consists of two contributions : the ab phase due to the magnetic flux change by @xmath31 and the statistical phase due to introducing @xmath33 additional quasiparticles of charge @xmath22 to the interferometer area : @xmath78 if we assume that the active area of the interferometer remains constant throughout a magnetic field sweep , these two contributions are not independent ; @xmath32 and hence @xmath79 .",

    "since the smallest charge carriers are expected to dominate tunneling at the low temperature , weak tunneling limit  @xcite ( or , in the case of the anti - pfaffian state , to vary with temperature in the same way as transport due to @xmath27 quasiparticles ) , we will first focus on these @xmath4 excitations .",
    "as shown in the main text , if the @xmath0 state is non - abelian ( whether it is moore  read or anti - pfaffian ) , this should manifest itself via a @xmath80 oscillation period corresponding to the even - odd effect .",
    "an additional @xmath81 period of purely abelian nature is also expected , although it may be washed out by fermion parity fluctuations .",
    "if , on the other hand , the @xmath0 state is an abelian @xmath2 state  @xcite , the @xmath80 oscillation period should not be observed  there is no even - odd effect in this case .",
    "an abelian phase can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : net_phase_2 ] ) with a slight caveat . the statistical angle @xmath82 can be either @xmath83 or @xmath84 , depending on whether the spin of a quasiparticle going around the interferometer and that of a quasiparticle inside the loop are the same or opposite .",
    "since the @xmath2 state is spin - unpolarized , excitations of both spins may carry charge around the interference loop .",
    "hence we can use the average value of the statistical angle , i.e. @xmath85 , per quasiparticle ( or , more precisely , @xmath86 per pair with opposite spins ) .",
    "this yields @xmath87 = - 2{\\pi } \\left({\\phi}/{\\phi_0}\\right)$ ] .",
    "the resulting oscillation period is @xmath81 .",
    "so far in our discussion we have neglected other types of charged excitations , particularly the charge @xmath27 excitations that are also expected at @xmath0 .",
    "these excitations are always abelian and their statistical angle is @xmath88 , irrespective of the nature of the state .",
    "( [ eq : net_phase_2 ] ) then yields @xmath89 implying a @xmath90 periodicity . while backscattering of these quasiparticles at quantum point contacts should be suppressed by comparison to @xmath4 quasiparticles ( except in the anti - pfaffian state ) , it is likely that their coherence length is much longer , which in turn enhances their contribution to the coherent interference signal  @xcite . it therefore remains a puzzle that period @xmath90 oscillations are not convincingly seen in our data , particularly in view of the fact that @xmath27 oscillations were a prominent feature seen in the side - gate voltage sweeps  @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is the relatively narrow magnetic field window available for @xmath28-sweeps at @xmath0 , which in turn makes it difficult to see longer - period oscillations .",
    "this window is limited by the narrow width of the @xmath0 plateau immediately flanked by the reentrant compressible integer states  @xcite  see more on this in the next section .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the data presented here was measured at @xmath91mk , while previously reported side - gate voltage sweeps were performed at @xmath92mk and higher ; lowering the temperature should lead to the suppression of the @xmath27 contribution to oscillations .",
    "testing this argument by measuring @xmath28-sweeps at higher temperatures and for different device sizes is an important future direction",
    ".      additional sets of data showing fourier transforms of oscillations at integer , @xmath63 , and @xmath93 filling factors from different sample preparations are shown in fig .",

    "note that the @xmath93 peak is split and is centered at @xmath94 for all the data sets in this figure .    in",
    "roughly half the data sets examined , we were able to resolve the predicted splitting of the 5/2 fft peak at five times the fundamental integer oscillation frequency ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "this splitting at @xmath96 to @xmath97 , due to modulation of the non - abelian oscillation by the low frequency ab / anyonic oscillations at @xmath0 , can be seen only when we take the fourier transform the resistance over a substantial range in @xmath28-field : such data is displayed in fig .  3 of the main text , and in fig .",
    "s[fig : s1 ] .",
    "some @xmath28-field sweeps in this study ran over only a small range of @xmath28 near 5/2 filling to focus on measuring the small period ( @xmath6 ) oscillations attributed to non - abelian @xmath4 expression / suppression : these results are shown in fig .  4 of the main text , and here in fig .",
    "s[fig : s2 ] .",
    "the other measurements , covering a larger range in @xmath28 , noted above , facilitate resolution of the splitting at 5/2 . however , the range of @xmath28-field of either of these oscillations is limited around 5/2 by the presence of reentrant integer states  @xcite adjacent to @xmath93 filling on both the high- and low - field sides .",
    "this is a more prominent effect in the larger area devices .      when side gate sweeps are applied rather than @xmath28-field sweeps , the multiple devices of different areas examined here display the same ab properties at 5/2 as observed in previous studies  @xcite , namely alternation of @xmath4 and @xmath982 period oscillations .",
    "see fig .",
    "s[fig : s3 ] .",
    "this alternation is attributed to the side gate excursion changing not only the enclosed magnetic flux number but also the localized non - abelian @xmath4 quasiparticle number .",

    "<S> the resistance oscillations observed near filling factor @xmath0 in multiple devises show a period consistent with the additional magnetic field needed to add one quasihole to their respective ( different ) active areas ( thereby changing the quasiparticle parity ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the presence of such a period is indicative of a non - abelian nature of the @xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> while this interpretation is based on several assumptions discussed earlier , using the @xmath1 fqh state for control measurements significantly strengthens our case .    </S>",
