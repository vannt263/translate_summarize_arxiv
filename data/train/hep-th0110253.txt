    "if it were nt for the weight of history , it would seem natural to take quantum mechanical phenomena as an indication that something has gone wrong with probability theory and to attempt to explain such phenomena by modifying probability theory itself , rather than by invoking quantum mechanics .",
    "it is actually easy to take this point of view because probability theory is so tightly constrained by cox s",
    "bayesian arguments@xcite that there is only one plausible try .",
    "trying this anyway@xcite , one finds that cox s arguments work even without the assumption that probabilities are real and non  negative and one obtains `` exotic '' copies of standard probability theory where the probabilities may belong to any real associative algebra with unit .",
    "with probability theory modified , there is no need for the usual `` wave - particle duality '' and one is free to assume , for example , that a particle in @xmath0 is somewhere in @xmath0 at each time . introducing such `` state spaces '' and assuming that probabilities have a square norm , exotic probabilities acquire the power to predict real non - negative frequencies and are limited to three algebras : reals , complex numbers and quaternions . given this framework , complex probabilities with state spaces @xmath0 or @xmath1 lead to the standard quantum theory in complete detail including the schrodinger equation and `` mixed states . ''",
    "quaternionic probabilities lead , on the other hand , to the dirac theory@xcite .",
    "although one might expect such theories to be ruled out by bell s arguments , modifying probability theory turns out to evade this and similar restrictions@xcite .",
    "because of the simple nature of the state space axioms and the bayesian nature of the exotic probabilities , the familiar semi  paradoxical measurement and observer questions from quantum theory do not arise@xcite .",
    "one has a theory which is quite substantially simpler than quantum mechanics both conceptually and mathematically .",
    "although predictions within state spaces like @xmath0 and @xmath2 agree with standard quantum mechanics , srinivasan has realized that one should expect even more interesting results in field theory because exotic probability theory can not produce the apparent divergences which are so common in quantum field theory .",
    "indeed , he has shown that with his quaternionic probability version of canonical quantization , he gets the correct result for the lamb shift without any renormalization procedure@xcite .",
    "this paper is intended as a review of the basic results from references 2 - 5 with more detail than is practical in letter sized papers , as a starting point for someone interested in this general subject and as an exposition of unanswered questions where further research is needed .",
    "the idea that probability theory might be altered in some way goes back at least to dirac@xcite . for a history of this idea ,",
    "the review by muckenheim et al.@xcite is a good starting point .",
    "related ideas can be found papers by srinivasan and sudarshan@xcite , gudder@xcite , feynman@xcite , tikochinsky@xcite , frohner@xcite , caticha@xcite , steinberg@xcite , belinskii@xcite , miller@xcite , muckenheim@xcite , khrennikov@xcite and pitowsky@xcite .",
    "this work is very influenced by the bayesian view of probability theory due to ed jaynes@xcite .",
    "in the bayesian view of probability theory , probabilities begin as real non - negative numbers assigned to pairs @xmath3 of arbitrary propositions .",
    "these numbers are meant to indicate , in some sense to be defined , how likely it is that proposition @xmath4 is true given that proposition @xmath5 is known . given this setup , cox argued@xcite that if such an assignment of numbers is to be useful as a likelihood , it should satisfy a few plausible conditions .",
    "he then demonstrates ( it is not a proof for reasons which will be clear below ) that these conditions lead unambiguously to the standard bayesian presentation of probability theory .",
    "the basic plan is to simply follow cox s work while dropping the assumption that probabilities are real and non - negative .    before beginning , there are a couple of technical points which might cause confusion .",
    "cox@xcite and jaynes@xcite",
    "discuss probability theory without any restriction on propositions .",
    "the idea is that probability theory is meant to be `` the logic of science '' and is meant to be treated slightly informally in the same sense that ordinary logic is treated slightly informally in mathematics .",
    "however , for definiteness , and since we will introduce several copies of probability theory , we work in a distributive lattice .",
    "the other technical point is that cox , jaynes and my previous papers work in a boolean lattice as opposed to a distributive lattice .",
    "it is easier to deal with a plain distributive lattice and this makes no difference for the results in references 2 - 5 .",
    "consider a set @xmath6 and a distributive lattice @xmath7 with `` propositions '' @xmath8 with minimum element @xmath9 and maximal element @xmath10 .",
    "for a function @xmath11 to be a useful measure of `` likelihood , '' we expect , following cox@xcite , that @xmath12 and @xmath13 should determine @xmath14 and denote the implied function by @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath16 , we also expect that @xmath12 and @xmath17 should determine @xmath14 and denote this function by @xmath18 .",
    "mathematically speaking , cox s point is that the structure of @xmath7 has implications for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for example , for any @xmath21 , we have @xmath22\\ ] ] and using the associativity of @xmath23 , @xmath24*(a\\wedge b\\wedge c\\rightarrow d).\\ ] ] letting @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 for all such triples @xmath29 . following cox , we further assume that @xmath19 is associative in general .",
    "similarly , suppose that we have @xmath8 with @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath30 .",
    "we then plausibly assume that @xmath20 is commutative in general .",
    "one can easily complete this picture checking properties of @xmath7 to see what is correspondingly expected in @xmath6 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     although the usual @xmath31\\subset { \\bf r}$ ] probabilities satisfy these conditions , they are only one possibility . at this stage ,",
    "any ring will do , even a ring with non - commutative multiplication like the quaternions .",
    "actually , the fact that we have to explain interference effects strongly suggests that we will need probabilities with an additive inverse .",
    "plausibly also requiring scaling of probabilities by real numbers , we assume , at this stage , that the probabilities of interest are real associative algebras with unit .",
    "further restrictions are to come in section 3 .",
    "the exotic probabilities of the last section seem exotic mainly because we are immediately familiar with what , say , @xmath32 means in terms of an experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "what is the predictive meaning of something like @xmath33 ? to answer this , it is helpful to realize that this problem already exists even in standard probability theory .",
    "there is nothing in probability theory as such that tells us that probability @xmath32 means @xmath34 should be expected in the corresponding frequency .",
    "this must be deduced from additional assumptions . in the standard probability case",
    ", one considers @xmath35 copies of the situation where @xmath5 was known .",
    "one then observes that the probability that @xmath4 is true @xmath36 times peaks at 0.25 , and for any interval containing 0.25 , the probability to be outside the interval can be reduced as much as one wants by increasing @xmath35 .",
    "roughly speaking , the frequency meaning of standard probabilities is fixed by the additional assumption that `` probability zero propositions never happen . ''",
    "it may help to notice that , as jaynes points out@xcite , standard probability theory works equally well on the interval @xmath37 $ ] rather than @xmath31 $ ] . in this case ,",
    "probability 4.0 would predict frequency 0.25 and one would be assuming that propositions with probability @xmath38 never happen .    in the case of exotics",
    ", we can not proceed quite as simply as in standard probability theory since , as will become clear , zero probability propositions may sometimes be true anyway .",
    "however , we can progress by assuming that @xmath7 contains a special subspace for which the standard arguments will hold . given @xmath6probability @xmath39 , let @xmath40 be a measure space and suppose that the free distributive lattice on @xmath41 is a sublattice of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we ll refer to the second component of @xmath41 as `` time '' and will often denote it as a subscript . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 denotes @xmath44",
    ". we will see below that frequency predictions follow if we assume that @xmath40 has properties that one would expect of `` the state of the system . '' in particular",
    ", we assume that for any time @xmath45 , @xmath46 for any @xmath47 with @xmath48 , meaning that `` the system ca nt be in two different states at the same time . '' please note the clash of terminology with standard quantum theory where `` state space '' means a hilbert space and not just a measure space .    given a state space @xmath40 , and any fixed time @xmath45 ,",
    "we can relate probabilities to functions from @xmath40 to @xmath6 . for @xmath8 ,",
    "let `` wave functions '' @xmath49 be defined by    @xmath50    for all measurable @xmath51 .",
    "such functions are therefore related by @xmath52 in general and @xmath53 if @xmath16 .    in order to get real non - negative numbers from probabilities ,",
    "we take @xmath6 to have a square norm @xmath54 satisfying @xmath55 for @xmath56 . given this , we will show that , under certain conditions , @xmath57 is a probability in the ordinary sense .",
    "when it does nt cause confusion , we will suppress the function name inside integrals as a notational convenience .",
    "we may , for example , write @xmath58 note that probabilities like @xmath59 are typically zero and , of course , @xmath60 is nt equal to @xmath61 .    to derive properties of @xmath62 , note that @xmath63 is equal to @xmath64 and , rearranging and using @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 as desired . if we also knew that for @xmath16 , @xmath67 then we would have a complete standard probability theory and a frequency meaning would follow as in the standard argument",
    ". however , ( 12 ) is true if and only if @xmath68 which , in a hilbert space setting , is equivalent to requiring @xmath69 and @xmath70 to be orthogonal .",
    "thus , we ve concluded that we can predict frequencies , but only for sublattices of @xmath7 for which @xmath71 holds .",
    "this includes the sublattice @xmath40 at any fixed time and the sublattice of propositions associated with a hermitian operator in the hilbert space case .",
    "for example , suppose that we have an orthogonal set of functions @xmath72 in the hilbert space @xmath73 and suppose that @xmath7 contains the sublattice @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the proposition `` @xmath76 is the best description of the system at time @xmath45 . ''",
    "@xmath77 is a sublattice and ( 12 ) is satisfied because @xmath78 is zero for @xmath79 and so @xmath62 on the sublattice @xmath77 is therefore a probability theory in the ordinary sense and , for example @xmath80 is the expected frequency that @xmath81 is the best description of the system at time @xmath45 assuming that one of the @xmath82 is optimal .    as another example , consider how we would describe a stern  gerlach experiment with quaternion probabilities and state space @xmath83 .",
    "at any time @xmath45 while the particle is heading towards the magnet , @xmath84 is a sublattice of @xmath7 and @xmath62 is a standard probability theory and predicts how often various subsets of @xmath40 are occupied . at a time @xmath85",
    "when the particle has gone through the magnet and either gone up or down , @xmath86 is also a sublattice and @xmath87 is also standard and predicts the results of the experiment .",
    "however , although @xmath88 is a a sublattice of @xmath7 , we can not conclude that either @xmath62 or @xmath87 are standard probabilities because interference terms may prevent ( 12 ) from being satisfied .",
    "this is why exotic probabilities are nt eliminated by bell s inequalities ( see section 8) .",
    "you can also see that this implies that the stern ",
    "gerlach experiment is not a dynamical system .",
    "if there was a function @xmath89 such that a particle at @xmath90 always arrives at @xmath91 , probabilities on @xmath92 would be determined by @xmath62 and @xmath93 . in this sense",
    "the stern ",
    "gerlach system is realistic but not deterministic .",
    "thus , we have found that exotic probabilities can indeed acquire predictive power provided we introduce a `` state space '' within @xmath7 and a square norm on @xmath6 . since the square norm property @xmath55 is crucial ,",
    "we conclude that probabilities must be real associative algebras with a square norm .",
    "there are , however , only are only three such algebras : the reals , the complex numbers and the quaternions@xcite .",
    "this means that particles may only be spin 0 or spin 1/2 . since ( 12 ) is only prevented by `` interference terms '' we see that , in this sense , `` standard probability theory is restored in the classical limit . ''",
    "as pointed out in reference 4 , modifying probability theory means that we are free to simply assume that if a particle arrives at a point @xmath94 at a detecting screen in a two slit experiment , the particle was therefore somewhere in @xmath0 at any previous @xmath95 . in general , we assume that @xmath96 for all @xmath97 , @xmath95 .",
    "this has immediate implications . for @xmath98 , @xmath99 and if we also assume that probabilities are time invariant in the sense that @xmath100 for any @xmath101 , @xmath102 , then @xmath103 for some @xmath104 .",
    "this implies that @xmath105 for time independent @xmath106 . for those used to quantum mechanics",
    ", this may seem puzzling because , after assuming very little , we concluded that `` the system is in an energy eigenstate . ''",
    "what if the system is , in fact in some other state ?",
    "if this question occurs to you , remember that an exotic probability like @xmath107 is only the best estimate that @xmath108 is true given that @xmath84 is known .",
    "if one knows some additional facts @xmath109 about the system , one should instead calculate @xmath110 .",
    "thus , our wave functions only represent what one knows about a system and ca nt be interpreted as `` the state of the system '' in any reasonable sense .",
    "different observers will have different knowledge about a system and they may also describe a single system with different wave functions .",
    "this means that if an observer does not know all the relevant facts about a system , their wave functions may give incorrect predictions .",
    "of course , this is not a failure of exotic probability theory any more than it is a failure of ordinary probability theory when the usual analysis of a die fails in the case of loaded die . in both cases ,",
    "the theories are successful to the extent that relevant facts are known . from the bayesian view",
    ", the particular result above means that if one knows only that the system was somewhere in state space at time @xmath45 , then the best description of the system at any later time is one of the energy eigenfunctions .",
    "one last assumption completes what one intuitively means by a `` state space . ''",
    "intuitively , if one knows the `` state '' @xmath90 at time @xmath111 , then any previous knowledge should be irrelevant . in this sense , it is natural to assume @xmath112 for any @xmath113 , @xmath101 , @xmath97 .",
    "this assumption also has immediate consequences . for @xmath101 , letting subscripts indicate time ordering and using @xmath114 , @xmath115 and , repeating the same argument , @xmath116 for any sequence of intermediate times @xmath117 .",
    "we can refer to such an expression as a `` path integral . ''",
    "note that this expression together with the definition of @xmath118 means that `` paths interfere if they end at the same point in @xmath40 . ''",
    "this is the exotic probability version of the `` which path '' principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "before continuing on to physics , let s collect the definitions so far and establish some terminology",
    ". for the rest of the paper , we assume lattices to be distributive and to have minimum and maximum elements denoted `` @xmath119 '' and `` @xmath120 '' respectively . by a `` measure space , '' we always mean a measure space with a finite real non - negative measure .",
    "fix @xmath121 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "a @xmath6probability is a lattice @xmath7 together with a function @xmath11 satisfying @xmath124 for all @xmath8 and satisfying @xmath125 for all @xmath8 with @xmath16 .    here",
    "are a few simple examples .",
    "let @xmath7 be the lattice @xmath126 and let @xmath12 be @xmath119 if @xmath4 is the minimum and @xmath120 if @xmath4 is the maximum .",
    "this is a @xmath6probability .",
    "given a lattice @xmath7 , let @xmath127 be some function satisfying @xmath128 in general and @xmath129 if @xmath130 .",
    "then @xmath131 makes @xmath39 into a @xmath6probability .",
    "let @xmath7 be a totally ordered lattice and let @xmath12 be @xmath120 if @xmath132 and @xmath119 otherwise .",
    "this is also a @xmath6probability . given a @xmath6probability @xmath39 and a sublattice @xmath133 of @xmath7 ,",
    "let @xmath134 be an element of @xmath7 .",

    "following standard probability theory , we say that propositions @xmath138 are independent if @xmath139 for all @xmath140 and this implies @xmath141 as usual .",
    "we say that subsets @xmath142 of @xmath7 are independent if @xmath5 and @xmath4 are independent for all @xmath143 and @xmath144 .    given a @xmath6probability @xmath39",
    ", we can define the product of independent sublattices @xmath133 and @xmath35 of @xmath7 .",
    "letting @xmath145 be defined by @xmath146 this defines a @xmath6probability , even if @xmath6 is not commutative .",
    "let @xmath40 be a measure space and let @xmath147 be the free lattice on @xmath41 subject to @xmath148 for all @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath111 and @xmath149 for @xmath97 and times @xmath95 .",

    "to exercise our ideas so far , let s analyze the interferometer shown in figure 1 in some detail .",
    "although one is instinctively shy at first , we are free to use simple language to describe what happens as if the particle was a marble .    working within a @xmath122probability with state space @xmath83",
    ", we can say that a particle hits @xmath151 and either goes on the @xmath152 branch or the @xmath153 branch . after hitting either mirror @xmath154 or @xmath155 ,",
    "the particle is on the @xmath156 or the @xmath157 branch respectively .",
    "the particle will hit @xmath158 and will end up in either detector @xmath159 or in detector @xmath160 .",
    "experimentally , one surprisingly finds that particles always end up in @xmath160 . letting `` @xmath161 '' informally denote the experimental arrangement",
    ", we would like to calculate @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "since @xmath164 implies both @xmath165 and @xmath166 , we have @xmath167 . using @xmath168",
    ", we mechanically apply axioms to produce @xmath169 since @xmath152 is equivalent to a point in @xmath40 , previous knowledge is irrelevant and we have @xmath170",
    ". we also clearly want to assume that the particle ca nt hop the rails , in other words we assume that @xmath171 is zero unless @xmath172 .",
    "this causes one of the sums to disappear giving @xmath173 this result is not surprising , but the point to focus on is that the result follows rigorously from the exotic probability axioms with natural assumptions given the marble  like picture of what is happening .    to proceed further , we have to define what happens at the mirrors and the beam splitters .",
    "naturally , in either this case or in standard quantum theory , what one means by `` a mirror '' and `` a beam splitter '' has to be put in by hand . in the ideal case ,",
    "what one means by a `` mirror '' is that complex probabilities of particle bouncing off of it pick up a factor of @xmath174 .",
    "a good experimentalist would naturally test this assumption in other measurements .",
    "similarly , the beam splitters multiply probabilities by a factor of @xmath174 when there is a `` bounce . ''",
    "thus , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 and so @xmath179 as expected .",
    "suppose now that the interferometer is such that a device could be attached to @xmath154 such that it registered `` hit '' or `` nohit '' depending on whether the particle struck @xmath154 or not .",
    "experimentally the results are different and about half the particles go into @xmath159 . in quantum theory , one says that this is due to the `` which path '' principle .",
    "the two paths ending in @xmath159 no longer interfere because `` you can tell which path was taken . ''",
    "you can see that this result also follows mechanically with exotic probabilities . in the described situation",
    ", @xmath0 is evidently not a sufficient state space and one should use at least @xmath180 . in this case , one can explicitly calculate that the interference is lost because two paths ending in @xmath159 no longer end at the same point in the state space .",
    "one can also calculate that if the device detecting whether @xmath154 is hit works so poorly that @xmath181 are independent of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , then the interference effect is entirely restored@xcite .",
    "note the difference with standard quantum theory .",
    "quantum mechanics has no problem with this interferometer in the sense that the wave equation can be solved for any desired input wave packet .",
    "of course , no one wants to do this , especially to get such simple results .",
    "this explains the popularity of the `` which path '' principle even though it is not completely clear what it means or how it follows from the fundamental wave equation .",
    "this is analogous to doing probability theory knowing the diffusion equation but not knowing kolmogorov s axioms . in exotic probabilities , on the other hand , both a rigorous version of",
    "the `` which path '' principle and any wave equation are consequences of the underlying exotic probability theory .",
    "the interferometer from the previous section suggests that exotics may be particularly helpful in situations where one wants predictions which are independent of details of initial wave functions and potentials .",
    "`` exponential decay '' provides simple examples of such situations and also brings up one of the lesser known mysteries of quantum theory .",
    "consider a system such as a @xmath182 nucleus or a muon which may decay irreversibly .",
    "given such a system , if the probability for a decay within a time interval @xmath45 only depends on @xmath45 and not on the history of the system , then a familiar argument in probability theory implies that the probability density for decay is exponential .",
    "quantum mechanics , however , does not generally predict this@xcite and so it would seem that for such non  exponential systems , the assumption that they decay independent of their history is not correct . as with other paradoxes@xcite , we can resolve this by realizing that the physical assumptions are correct ; the problem is caused by probability theory itself . applying the physical assumptions to exotic probability theory instead , we suppose that in a @xmath6probability with state space @xmath40 , @xmath100 for all @xmath102 .",
    "suppose also that @xmath40 contains a subset @xmath183 whose complement @xmath184 is a `` trap '' in the sense that @xmath185 implies @xmath186 for any @xmath95 .",
    "this means that @xmath187 implies @xmath188 for any @xmath95 also . with arguments similar to those in section 4 , we find @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 for some @xmath104 and @xmath193 .",
    "although the exotic probabilities are simple exponentials , this is nt preserved in the predicted frequencies . the ordinary probability to remain free for time",
    "@xmath45 is @xmath194 and , using @xmath195 and @xmath196 , we have @xmath197 where @xmath198 for small @xmath45 and assuming that @xmath199 is real an negative , @xmath200 will decrease more slowly than @xmath201 . if we also know that @xmath202 and @xmath203 can be taken to be independent for sufficiently large @xmath45 , then we say that the system is `` forgetful . '' in this case , @xmath204 is asymptotically constant and @xmath200 will be exponential for large times .",
    "such deviations from exponential decay have only recently been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "the examples of the last two sections show the usefulness of applying exotic probability theory directly as opposed to solving a pde .",
    "this sort of reasoning is mostly missing in standard quantum theory .",
    "bell s well known analysis of the spin version of the einstein  podolsky ",
    "rosen experiment@xcite is almost universally summarized as showing that local realistic theories are incompatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics and are therefore wrong .",
    "one might then expect that exotic probabilities would be ruled out by bell because they are `` realistic '' in the state space sense .",
    "bell s analysis , however , does not follow once we modify probability theory . to see the problem , you only have to notice that the first step in bell s analysis assumes that @xmath205 and @xmath206 for initial setup @xmath161 , final measurement @xmath207 and assuming that the final results are determined by some `` hidden variable '' @xmath208 at some time @xmath45 during the flight from decay to detectors .",
    "as pointed out in section 3 , equation 33 fails to hold in general due to `` interference terms''@xcite .",
    "in fact , bell has shown exactly that if one wants local realism one must modify probability theory .",
    "ironically , the standard summary of his results gives the opposite impression .    over the years",
    ", there have been more than twenty variations on bell s result each with a different experimental arrangement and each concluding that local realistic theories are impossible .",
    "bell s result and two of the more well known variations are considered in reference 3 in some detail and are shown not to eliminate exotic probabilities .",
    "there has also been an increasing tendency to refer to bell and similar results as `` non  local '' effects because they can not be explained by local correlations@xcite .",
    "the point is , however , that if one has the wrong probability theory , one may also have the wrong notion of what is just a correlation . within exotic probability theory",
    ", we expect that bell s results are just correlations in the new probability theory .",
    "it s helpful to think of a classical experiment where one cuts a penny into a heads half and a tails half and mails one half penny to house @xmath209 and the other half to house @xmath77 .",
    "the results at the two houses are correlated , but nothing travels between them to insure the proper results .",
    "one therefore expects that there is nothing that one can do at house @xmath209 to affect the fact that , at house @xmath77 , one will find heads 50% of the time and tails 50% of the time .",
    "the same holds true in the epr experiment .",
    "the results at one end of the experiment are 50% spin up and 50% spin down independent of the magnet orientation nothing that happens on the other side can affect this .",

    "these arguments need to be made into proofs , but there is also a mystery as to why only parts of the available moments seem to be used by nature .",
    "why , for instance , must @xmath219 be purely real in @xmath0 ?",
    "in standard quantum theory , the state of the system is a ray in a hilbert space . to define such a theory one must define a hilbert space and a complete set of mutually commuting self - adjoint operators to serve as observables .",
    "in addition , one chooses a hamiltonian and labels the states in the hilbert space by irreducible representations of the hamiltonian s symmetry group . for hamiltonians invariant under the lorentz group ,",
    "states have spin and four  momenta .",
    "time evolution is a one parameter semigroup given by the hamiltonian operator .",
    "if  mixed states \" occur , they must be described by density matrices .",
    "quite a bit of functional analysis must be understood to define this precisely .    in an exotic probability theory ,",
    "on the other hand , the state of the system is a point in a measure space @xmath40 . to define the theory , one simply chooses @xmath40 and picks @xmath229 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "particles are not thought of as having momentum or spin , or any other internal structure . the only thing that a particle can do is to be somewhere .",
    "this is all that is required , however , because experiments which measure things like momentum and spin are always ultimately measuring position .",
    "wave functions have the same status as densities do in bayesian theory .",
    "people with different knowledge about a system will , in general , use different wave functions .",
    "those who have more knowledge can expect better predictions .",
    "situations requiring `` mixed states '' in quantum theory are described by the same exotic theory without modification@xcite and , similarly , there is no sensible concept of `` being in a mixed state . ''",
    "rather than choosing a hamiltonian , one notes that wave functions are propagated in time by the unknown @xmath230 . in typical state spaces",
    "this propagation obeys a pde which depends only upon the lowest moments of @xmath230 and these moments are identified with the vector potential and metric tensor .",
    "the relevant moments can either be measured experimentally with test particles or computed with some external theory like maxwell s equations .",
    "one does not assume lorentz or gauge invariance to get these results .",
    "physical theories are thought to be quantum theories in only in a somewhat general sense .",
    "the successful predictions of quantum mechanics , must , of course , be reproduced , but this is not taken to mean that any theory must literally satisfy the axioms of quantum theory .",
    "there is , however , an independent reason why physical theories must be precisely exotic probability theories . the results of section two and three indicate that any theory which assigns likelihoods to pairs of propositions from a distributive lattice must exactly be an exotic probability theory or must violate one of our two cox conditions or must fail to reduce to standard probability theory when predicting frequencies .",
    "physical theories are constrained by the results here just as alternatives to standard probability theory are constrained by cox s original arguments .",
    "the implications of this raise many questions about how this should be done for the rest of physics .    in the case of field theory",
    ", srinivasan has pioneered application of exotic probabilities to quantum field theory by calculating the lamb shift in a quaternionic version of canonical quantization .",
    "his results agree with qed without any renormalization procedure .",
    "in addition to srinivasan s approach it is clear in a very simple sense that electrons must emit photons because the vector potential remains unknown even when the electromagnetic field has been measured . even in the case of a single electron",
    ", one must therefore sum over the various possible gauge equivalent vector potentials .",
    "one has no choice but to predict that an electron will have various possible motions and these will be correlated with various possible vector potentials .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this simple effect should fit naturally in the framework of a complete field theory .",
    "this , however , has not been done .",
    "also , similar considerations hold for the metric tensor and weighted sums over various possible metric tensors must similarly be finite . does this then mean that one could calculate gravitational radiation ?",
    "exotic probability theories are much more restrictive than quantum mechanics in the sense that the form of the vector potential and metric tensor is already determined by the choice of state space and probability .",
    "since the choice of probability seems to be fixed by spin , one apparently only has the state space left to explain things like other gauge theories besides qed",
    ". can yang - mills theories be formulated as exotic probability theories , and , if so , with what state space ?",
    "other questions arise if we sketch the general procedure for finding a pde for wave functions .",
    "the basic theory here is formulated with a state space @xmath40 only assumed to be a measure space . assuming that @xmath40 also has a topology , consider a point @xmath231 in an open set @xmath232 .",
    "one assumes that a time difference @xmath233 can be chosen such that @xmath230 is negligible for @xmath234 outside of @xmath235 .",
    "in addition , we suppose that @xmath235 can be chosen such that @xmath230 can be approximated by a function of only @xmath236 and @xmath233 . given this , the path integral within @xmath235 collapses to a convolution and",
    "this can be inverted with a fourier transform resulting in a kernel depending only on the lowest moments of the time derivative of @xmath230 as in section 9 .",
    "another way to think about this is to consider the ring of @xmath6valued functions on @xmath235 with pointwise addition and convolution as multiplication . in this case",
    ", we assume that these rings have units @xmath237 in a `` dirac sequence '' sense@xcite @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "this can be solved by considering a slight generalization of the standard quadratic form : a function @xmath240 where @xmath241 for a symmetric bilinear @xmath242 .",
    "then @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 provides solutions . as mentioned in section 9 , this raises the question of why only certain of these @xmath237 are seen in nature .",
    "there is also the question of what exactly must be assumed about @xmath40 since , besides a topology , we only seem to need subtraction of nearby points in @xmath235 . for instance , it is perhaps interesting to remove geometry entirely by allowing any multiplication on @xmath246 which forms a ring with pointwise addition and has a unit in the dirac sequence sense .",
    "although srinivasan has worked in field theory directly , simple multi  particle systems have not been done with exotic probabilities . in particular , what is the relationship between spin and statistics for exotic probabilities ?",
    "this seems likely to be interestingly different than in standard field theory .",
    "although the time parameter in exotics seems essential once the state space axioms are introduced , this does not mean that exotics are nonrelativistic .",
    "`` time '' in the complex @xmath2 theory , for example , can be interpreted as the proper time or path length parameter .",
    "one suspects however , that `` time '' is really the order in which one discovers facts about the system rather than anything more intrinsic . in this case",
    ", one might expect that automorphisms of the time parameter should result in equivalent theories with modified moments of @xmath230 .",
    "is this correct and , if so , what are the consequences of invariance under time automorphisms ?",
    "the fact that the vector potential appears as the first moment of the time derivative of @xmath247 suggests that maxwell s equations should describe complex or quaternionic vector potentials .",
    "are there complex and quaternionic versions of maxwell s equations and , if so , are it s classical predictions correct ?",
    "the whole area of `` bayesian inference '' in ordinary probability theory is based on the idea that one can used bayes theorem ( which also follows in exotics ) to systematically improve probabilities based on `` prior '' knowledge .",
    "it is clear that the same thing should be possible with exotic probabilities . in the standard bayesian case",
    ", this is often based on the maximum entropy principle .",
    "the issue , then , is how to do bayesian inference and is there an analogue of maximum entropy ?",
    "exotic probability theories as described here appear to be the only generalization of probability theory consistent with the basic bayesian framework .",
    "in addition to standard probability theory , we find that three exotic copies are possible where probabilities are real , complex or quaternion valued respectively . although the exotic theories are substantially simpler that quantum mechanics both conceptually and mathematically , they nevertheless give the same predictions as standard quantum theory .",
    "these theories constrain physical theories in the same sense that cox s original arguments constrain possible alternatives to standard probability theory .",
    "the implications of this beyond basic quantum theory are mostly unexplored , but we have attempted to at least formulate some fundamental open questions where new insights are needed .",
