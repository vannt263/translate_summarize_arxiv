    "analog to analog ( a2a ) compression of signals has recently gathered interest in information theory @xcite . in a2a compression , a high dimensional analog signal @xmath0",
    "is encoded into a lower dimensional analog signal @xmath1 .",
    "the goal is to design the encoding so as to preserve in @xmath2 all the information about @xmath3 , and to obtain successful decoding for a given distortion measure like mse or error probability . in particular ,",
    "the encoding may be corrupted by noise .",
    "it is worth mentioning that when the alphabet of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is finite , this framework falls into traditional topics of information theory such as lossless and lossy data compression , or joint source - channel coding .",
    "the novelty of a2a compression is to consider @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be real valued and to impose regularity constrains on the encoder , in particular linearity , as motivated by compressed sensing @xcite .",
    "the challenge and practicality of a2a compression is to obtain dimensionality reduction , i.e. , @xmath6 , by exploiting a prior knowledge on the signal .",
    "this may be sparsity as in compressed sensing . for @xmath7-sparse signals , and without any stability or complexity considerations ,",
    "it is not hard to see that the dimensionality reduction can be of order @xmath8 . a measurement rate of order @xmath9 has been shown to be sufficient to obtain stable recovery by solving tractable optimization algorithms like convex programming ( @xmath10 minimization ) .",
    "this remarkable achievement has gathered tremendous amount of attention with a large variety of algorithmic solutions deployed over the past years .",
    "the vast majority of the research has however capitalized on a common sparsity model .",
    "several works have explored connections between information theory and compressed sensing , in particular @xcite , however it is only recently @xcite that a foundation of a2a compression has been developed , shifting the attention to probabilistic signal models beyond the sparsity structure .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that under linear encoding and lipschitz - continuous decoding , the fundamental limit of a2a compression is the rnyi information dimension ( rid ) , a measure whose operational meaning had remained marginal in information theory until @xcite . in the case of a nonsingular mixture distribution , the rid is given by the mass on the continuous part , and for the specific case of sparse mixture distributions , this gives a dimensionality reduction of order @xmath8 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this improvement on compressed sensing is due to potentially complex or non - robust coding strategies .",
    "@xcite shows that robustness to noise is not a limitation of the framework in @xcite .",
    "two other works @xcite have corroborated the fact that complexity may not be a limitation either . in @xcite spatially - coupled matrices are used for the encoding of the signal , leveraging on the analytical ground of spatially - coupled codes and predictions of @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite shows that the rid is achieved using approximate message passing algorithm with block diagonal gaussian measurement matrices measurement matrices .",
    "however , the size of the blocks are increasing as the measurement rate approaches the rid . in @xcite , using a new entropy power inequality ( epi ) for integer - valued random variables that was further developed in @xcite , the polarization technique was used to deterministically construct partial hadamard matrices for encoding discrete signals over the reals .",
    "this provides a way to achieve a measurement rate of @xmath11 for signals with a zero rid along with a stable low complexity recovery algorithm .",
    "the case of mixture distributions was however left open in @xcite .",
    "this paper proposes a new approach to a2a compression by means of a polarization theory over the reals .",
    "the use of polarization techniques for sparse recovery was proposed in @xcite for discrete signals , relying on coding strategies over finite fields . in this paper , it is shown that using the rid , one obtains a natural counter - part over the reals of the entropy polarization phenomenon @xcite . specifically , the entropy ( or source ) polarization phenomenon @xcite shows that transforming an i.i.d .",
    "sequence of discrete random variables using an hadamard matrix polarizes the conditional entropies to the extreme values of 0 and 1 ( deterministic and maximally random distributions ) .",
    "we show in this paper that the rid of an i.i.d .",
    "sequence of mixture random variables also polarizes to the two extreme values @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( discrete and continuous distributions ) . to get to this result",
    ", properties of the rid in vector settings and related information measures are first developed .",
    "it is then shown that the rid polarization is , as opposed to the entropy polarization , obtained with an analytical pattern .",
    "in other words , there is no need to rely on algorithms to compute the set of components which tend to 0 or 1 , as this is given by a known pattern equivalent to the bec channel polarization @xcite .",
    "this is then used to obtain universal a2a compression schemes based on explicit partial hadamard matrices .",
    "the current paper focuses on the encoding strategies and on extracting the rid without specifying the decoding strategy .",
    "numerical simulations provide evidence that efficient message passing algorithms may be used in conjunction to the obtained encoders .",
    "finally , the paper extends the realm of a2a compression to a multi signal settings .",
    "techniques of distributed compressed sensing were introduced in @xcite for specific classes of sparse signal models . we provide here an information theoretic framework for general multi signal a2a compression , as a counter part of the slepian&wolf coding problem in source compression @xcite .",
