    "investigation of the magnetic properties of the newly discovered layered fe - based pnictide supercondutors @xcite with a microscopic probe such as mssbauer spectroscopy is of interest for ( at least ) two reasons : i ) to determine the characteristics of the expected spin - density wave ( sdw ) order and ii ) to give experimental evidence concerning the problem of the interaction and/or local coexistence between superconductivity and magnetic ordering of the fe moments . in the so - called 122 family with ba ,",
    "the parent ( non superconducting ) compound is bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 and doping with co substituted for fe has been shown to induce superconductivity at low doping levels @xcite . in the ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 series , the phase diagram as a function of co concentration @xmath4 is `` bell - shaped '' , with @xmath7 presenting a maximum of 26k for @xmath4=0.07 @xcite . below this optimal concentration ,",
    "the material shows apparently the persistence of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) structure in the superconducting phase , the af or spin density wave ( sdw ) transition temperature decreasing rapidly as @xmath4 increases .",
    "neutron diffraction in the undoped compound bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite has determined the af magnetic structure below @xmath8143k to be _ a priori _ commensurate .",

    "the full arrows mark the inflexion point of @xmath11 , attributed to the onset of magnetic ordering ( @xmath12 ) , and the dash - dotted arrows the superconducting transition temperature.,width=415 ]    in this work , we focus on the first problem evoked above : we performed a @xmath0fe mssbauer study of ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 in the underdoped region in order to investigate the sdw state . in our samples with co doping @xmath4=0.014 , 0.03 and 0.045 , the resistivity data show an inflexion point @xcite respectively around 115k , 92k and 64k ( see fig.[rhot ] ) .",
    "according to neutron diffraction data in materials with similar co dopings @xcite , this temperature corresponds to the sdw - paramagnetic transition .",
    "we find that the spectra in the magnetic phase have an unusual shape , which we interpret as due to an incommensurate modulation of the af structure , i.e. to an incommensurate ( ic ) spin density wave .",
    "we also find that the magnetic hyperfine subspectrum persists far above @xmath12 , i.e. that af correlations are present up to @xmath13 .",
    "the samples are single crystals prepared by the self - flux method , as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was checked that co doping is uniform and that superconductivity occurs in the bulk @xcite . for the mssbauer measurements , the crystals were finely ground .",
    "powder samples made by solid state reaction were also prepared , with @xmath4=0 and 0.03 , for comparison purposes .",
    "the spectra were recorded using a commercial @xmath0co@xmath14:rh @xmath15-ray source mounted on an electromagnetic drive with linear velocity signal .",
    "room temperature spectra ensured that no trace of feas ( with a quadrupole splitting @xmath16=0.69mm / s ) was present .    in the high temperature tetragonal phase ( space group @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the @xmath18 fe site has fourfold symmetry ( @xmath19m2 ) . at low temperature , slightly above @xmath12 , a small orthorhombic distortion takes place ( space group @xmath20 ) , and the local symmetry at the @xmath21 fe site is lowered ( 222 ) .",

    ", one observes a single magnetic hyperfine pattern , in agreement with ref.@xcite , with a hyperfine field @xmath22 t .",
    "by contrast , the spectral shapes in the co - doped compounds are rather far from this standard 6-line pattern .",
    "saturation effects can be discarded since the resonant absorption is modest ; for @xmath4=0.03 , where it amounts to 7% , we checked that an absorber with 2% absorption yields exactly the same spectrum .",
    "texture effects are also negligible since a powder absorber ( for @xmath4=0.03 ) yields spectra quasi - identical with those of the single crystal sample . the high statistics reached in these experiments allows us to distinguish fine details of the spectral shape , which is a prerequisite for the fits to be described below .    .in",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in intermetallic compounds , it is usually assumed that the fermi contact interaction with @xmath25-electrons is the dominant hyperfine coupling , implying that the fe moment * m * is proportional to the hyperfine field * h@xmath26 * @xcite .",
    "this is true in @xmath27-fe , with a hyperfine constant @xmath28=@xmath29 15t/@xmath30 , and in a number of other intermetallics with similar @xmath28 value . in the 122 family of isostructural pnictides ,",
    "the ratios of hyperfine field and moment are smaller and present rather scattered values ( see table [ tchf ] , where the moment is taken from neutron diffraction data ) .",
    "a strict proportionality between moment and hyperfine field can be however questioned in the pnictides .",
    "indeed , the magnetic susceptibility has been found to be anisotropic ( @xmath31 1.5 - 2 ) both in undoped bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite and in co - doped compounds @xcite .",
    "this is a hint to the presence of an `` unquenched '' orbital moment at the fe site .",
    "this implies a probably small , but non - zero contribution of the @xmath32-orbitals to the hyperfine field , with a sign opposite to that of the fermi contact field .",
    "then , like in fe@xmath33 compounds @xcite , the hyperfine field is no longer strictly proportional to the moment .",
    "the hyperfine field modulation then would not reflect exactly that of the fe moment .",
    "however , assuming as a first good approximation that proportionality holds in the ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 series with the same constant as in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , then the maximum fe moment of the modulation at 4.2k would be 0.96 , 0.84 and 0.72@xmath30 for @xmath4=0.014 , 0.03 and @xmath4=0.045 respectively .      in the neutron diffraction studies of the series ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite ,",
    "the integrated intensity of the magnetic bragg peaks continuously drops towards zero as temperature is increased towards @xmath12 .",
    "this behaviour is in contrast with the @xmath9as nmr work in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite , where the transferred hyperfine field at the as nucleus shows a weak thermal variation and it was concluded that the sdw transition is first order .",
    "a similar discrepancy is observed in the present work in co - doped materials , where the main fourier component @xmath34 of the modulation retains a sizeable value at @xmath12 ( see fig.[pourc3 ] top ) .",
    "however , a correct comparison with the neutron data must take into account the fact that the intensity of a magnetic bragg peak is proportional to the square of the magnetic moment . in case of a modulated structure with fourier coefficients @xmath35 , it should scale with @xmath36 , where the brackets denote an average over a period of the moment modulation : @xmath37 figure [ intnorm ] shows the thermal variations of @xmath38 ( from the @xmath39 values determined by mssbauer spectroscopy ) for @xmath4=0.03 and of the intensity of a magnetic bragg peak for @xmath4=0.04 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 value is reduced by half at @xmath12 , in disagreement with the neutron data .",
    "similar behaviours occur for @xmath4=0.014 and 0.045 .",
    "it can thus be concluded that the sdw transition in the ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 series , as observed with the mssbauer local probe , also presents a strong first order character .",
    "comparing the moment values obtained from the neutron data @xcite for @xmath4=0.025 and 0.045 with the mssbauer results is more difficult since , in the scaling of the neutron bragg intensity , it was assumed that the magnetic structure is identical to that of bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , i.e. commensurate with the lattice spacings .",
    "the mean saturated fe moment value @xmath41 obtained from neutron diffraction should be compared with : @xmath42 assuming proportionality between hyperfine field and moment , and using the mssbauer derived values for @xmath43 , one gets : @xmath41=0.70 , 0.59 and 0.45@xmath30 resp . for @xmath4=0.014 , 0.03 and 0.045 .",
    "this must be compared with @xmath41=0.35 and 0.17@xmath30 resp . for @xmath4=0.025 and 0.045",

    "they are interpreted in terms of a continuous modulation of hyperfine fields at the fe sites arising from an incommensurate electronic sdw state .",
    "incommensurability is present at the lowest doping level , i.e. for @xmath4=0.014 , while the magnetic structure in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 is commensurate . above @xmath12",
    ", we do not observe a purely paramagnetic signal , but a coexistence of magnetic hyperfine and paramagnetic subspectra in a large temperature range , up to @xmath45 approximately for all samples .",
    "we believe this is due to the persistence of af short range correlated regions , probably dynamic , well above the sdw transition , which is found to have a strong first order character .",
    "our analysis of the hyperfine field modulations as a function of @xmath4 shows that magnetism is not strongly depleted as doping increases , i.e. the mean fe moment or the maximum of the modulation does not decrease with @xmath4 as rapidly as inferred from neutron diffraction data .",
    "we believe the incommensurability of the magnetic structure has not been evidenced by neutron scattering up to now due to the probable very small value of the incommensurate component(s ) of the sdw wave vector .",
