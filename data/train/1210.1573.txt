    "unprecedented areal and temporal coverage of the sky from dedicated surveys and amateur observers has greatly amplified the discovery rate of unusual optical transients .",
    "surveys such as pan - starrs , the palomar transient factory , and the catalina real - time transient survey have demonstrated the wealth of data that will be common in the era of the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) . in particular , a previously sparse regime of transient phase - space between classical novae ( @xmath3 mag ; @xcite ) and supernovae ( @xmath4 mag ; @xcite ) is now being populated with an increasing number of transients .",
    "these objects are quite diverse in their properties and may shed light on a wide range of explosion and eruption physics .",
    "in recent years , objects like sn2008s and ngc300ot @xcite and other luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) @xcite have been subjected to intense scrutiny .",
    "these intermediate luminosity optical transients ( ilots ; also referred to as sn impostors and luminous red novae ) might be the eruption of a dust - enshrouded massive star and promise to lend great insight into the late stages of massive stellar evolution or other poorly understood stellar physics . because the phase space these eruptions inhabit is crowded with fundamentally different transient systems , it is important for future transient discovery scrutinize this region with intensive spectroscopic and photometric followup to distinguish these explosions from other more traditional explosions , such as classical novae or supernovae , which to fall in this region of phase space would qualify them as remarkable in their own right .",
    "classical novae ( cne ) are binary systems where there is mass transfer from a ( possibly evolved ) secondary through the l1 lagrange point to a degenerate white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "when enough material has accreted to obtain critical temperature and density , nuclear burning begins .",
    "the @xmath5 chain gives way to cno reactions , which drive convection .",
    "the amount of energy deposited by the @xmath6 unstable nuclei then drives a radiative wind . because degenerate matter on the surface of the wd has a equation of state independent of temperature , these reactions proceed in a runaway fashion until the fermi temperature is reached and the surface layers of the white dwarf begin to function as an ideal gas sensitive to temperature and finally expand .",
    "this expansion speed can easily reach escape velocity and the radiation pressure ejects a shell of material @xcite .",
    "the inferred classical nova rate in the milky way is @xmath7 @xcite , however interstellar extinction and selection effects limit the number of observed novae .",
    "the mean absolute magnitude of novae is @xmath8 mag , and of nearly a thousand novae on record , less than 10 reached peak absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath9 mag @xcite .    here",
    "we present the detailed photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn2010u .",
    "we show that sn2010u  is clearly super - eddington at maximum light and identify it as a close spectroscopic analog to other super - eddington novae .",
    "we compare sn2010u  to the general nova population and recognize it as one of the most luminous and fast declining novae discovered to date .",
    "these characteristics of sn2010u  make it a valuable object to study in the context of outburst models and progenitor studies of luminous novae .",
    "@xcite discovered sn2010u  in ngc4214 on 2010 february 5.63 ut ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) and was subsequently observed by several amateur astronomers that night .",
    "sn2010u  is located at ra= , dec= ( j2000 ) , about @xmath10 east and @xmath11 north of the center of ngc4214 @xcite ( figure  [ fig : galaxy ] ) .",

    "@xcite determined that sn2010u  was initially mis - classified as a supernova , and is in fact a luminous and fast classical nova .",
    "they conclude that sn2010u  reached a peak absolute magnitude of @xmath14 mag and faded two magnitudes on a timescale of @xmath15 d. they use a distance modulus of @xmath16 , while our distance modulus determination is more recent . adopting our distance modulus ,",
    "the peak absolute magnitude using the results of @xcite is @xmath17 mag .",
    "we initiated a multi - band photometric follow - up campaign of sn2010ustarting on 2010 february 6.98 using the 2-m liverpool telescope ( lt ; @xcite ) with ratcam ; the 8-m gemini north telescope ( gn ) with gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) ; and the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ; @xcite ) with the andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ( alfosc ) .",

    "the quantum efficiency curves of the instrumental configurations used by the amateur astronomers peak around @xmath29  , so the unfiltered magnitudes were scaled to match the @xmath20-band photometry . in the case of the observation by j.  brimacombe , however , the transmission curve of his luminance filter peaks at 5500   and sharply declines outside the range @xmath30  , making calibration to @xmath19-band most appropriate .",
    "we summarize the optical photometric measurements in table  [ table : phot ] and present the light curve in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "we also observed sn2010u  with the _ swift _ satellite @xcite on 2010 march 3.82 with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and the uv / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) .",
    "we did not detect any x - ray or uv / optical emission coincident with the location of the source .",
    "a previous _ swift_/xrt observation of ngc4214 on 2007 march 26.50 , which included the field of sn2010u , showed no activity coincident with the source location .",
    "we analyzed all _ swift _ data with the @xmath31 software package and corresponding calibration files , applying standard screening and filtering criteria .",

    "we obtained three low resolution optical spectra of sn2010u  using the marcario low - resolution spectrograph ( lrs , @xcite ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; @xcite ) , alfosc on not , and gmos on gn .",
    "we reduced the not spectrum using the quba pipeline @xcite , implemented in iraf , and the het and gmos spectra using standard tasks in iraf .",
    "we observed all targets at low airmass ( @xmath37 ) with the slit was aligned to the parallactic angle , and flux - calibrated each spectrum using a spectrophotometric standard star observed at a similar airmass .",
    "all spectra were wavelength - calibrated by comparison with helium - neon - argon arc lamps .",
    "we summarize spectroscopic measurements and instrumental configurations in table  [ table : spectroscopy ] .",
    "we analyzed the resulting 1-d spectroscopic data in iraf using @xmath38 tasks and the scipy python packages @xcite .",
    "complete photometric and spectroscopic coverage of sn2010u  confirms the findings of @xcite : sn2010u  is a luminous classical nova , exhibiting a rapid optical decline and evolution from an optically thick spectrum dominated by hydrogen and iron emission lines to an optically thin nova spectrum entering the nebular stage .",
    "sn2010u  is not a supernova nor the eruption of a massive star because of its modest ejecta velocities ( @xmath39 ) and rapid optical decline and spectral evolution .",
    "supernovae typically exhibit much higher expansion velocities ( @xmath40 ) @xcite and while lbv eruptions exhibit a range of expansion velocities ( @xmath41 ; @xcite ) and strong hydrogen balmer emission , the presence of cno element lines and rapid optical and spectral evolution of sn2010u  strongly indicate that it was a classical nova and not an lbv .",
    "sn2010u  evolved rapidly after its discovery on 2010 february 5.63 .",
    "our light curve is well sampled near maximum light in @xmath20-band , and the transient is seen to rise @xmath42 magnitude from discovery to maximum . although the rise of sn2010u  is not captured in @xmath19-band , the first measurement at @xmath43 mag is contemporaneous with the measurement of maximum light in @xmath20-band . for the purpose of comparison with previous events , we adopt the date of @xmath19-band maximum , 2010 february 6.27 , as the date of maximum light .",
    "after maximum , sn2010u  rapidly declined with a linear slope in magnitude space , at first steeply and then becoming more gradual after 2010 february 10 ( figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "we followed the light curve of the transient until 2010 february 24 .",
    "@xcite followed the transient until 2010 march 18.40 , reporting a continued steady decline .",
    "the photometric evolution of classical novae is typically parameterized by the time to decline by two magnitudes from maximum light , @xmath44 .",
    "several studies have shown that @xmath18- or @xmath19-band are most appropriate to measure @xmath44 because h@xmath45 emission complicates measurements in @xmath20 band @xcite .",
    "we measure @xmath44 by adopting the @xmath19-band maximum ( 2010 february 6.27 ) , and then linearly interpolating between two @xmath19-band measurements at 2010 february 8.98 and 2010 february 10.07 in magnitude space , which gives a result that is accurate to @xmath46 days .",
    "the uncertainty in the date of maximum light derives from the assumption that maximum light in @xmath19-band corresponds with maximum light in @xmath20 band , and therefore we have captured the peak of the light curve to @xmath47 d. we find that sn2010u  underwent a fast decline , with a @xmath19-band maximum of @xmath48 mag and @xmath49 days .",
    "our determination of absolute magnitude and @xmath44 are in contrast to the results of @xcite , who derive @xmath50 mag and @xmath15 d. this is primarily due to the smaller distance modulus adopted here , and our better sampling of the light curve in the range @xmath51 to @xmath52 d. in addition , a fast decline is evident in @xmath18- , @xmath19- , and @xmath21-band as well .",
    "the rise time of sn2010u  from quiescence to maximum light remains unconstrained due to the comparatively shallow upper limit ( @xmath53 mag ) on january 24.74 ut and a large gap before discovery .",
    "we compare the colors of sn2010u  to those of other fast and luminous novae and the general nova population to determine if there is intrinsic host galaxy extinction . in figure",
    "[ fig : colors ] , the colors of sn2010u  are plotted against another fast and luminous nova , nova lmc 1991 ( hereafter l91 ) , and the average colors of the nova population .",

    "after correction for galactic reddening .",
    "a comparison of sn2010u  to l91 , another luminous and fast nova , assuming that any color difference is due to intrinsic host galaxy extinction , indicates that sn2010u  might suffer as much as @xmath58 mag of additional intrinsic extinction , raising the peak luminosity to @xmath59 mag . for the purpose of comparison ,",

    "if we were to assume that sn2010u  has the same intrinsic colors as l91 , then sn2010u  might suffer as much as @xmath62 mag of additional intrinsic extinction , which would raise its peak brightness to @xmath63 mag , making it the most luminous classical nova on record .",
    "however , sn2010u  could also simply be intrinsically redder than l91 .",
    "@xcite assume the @xmath64 mag color of v1500 cyg , another luminous nova , to infer @xmath65 mag for sn2010u .",

    "we conservatively assume no intrinsic host galaxy extinction for all further analysis .",
    "the _ swift _ xrt and uvot observed the location of sn2010u  25.6 days after maximum optical light and did not detect the source ( tables  [ table : swift_xrt ]  &  [ table : swift_uvot ] ) , placing a 3@xmath67 upper limit of @xmath68 for the x - rays in the 0.3 - 10.0  kev energy band . using the relationship derived in @xcite to convert optical extinction @xmath69 into hydrogen column density @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 . using the _ chandra _ x - ray center s _ portable , interactive multi - mission simulator _ ( pimms ) , and assuming a spectrum for the nova x - ray emission , we convert count rates into flux limits by assuming a spectrum for the nova .    @xcite present a compilation of 52 galactic and magellanic cloud cne and recurrent novae ( rne ) observed with the _ swift _ xrt .",
    "x - ray studies of cne have identified two different emission components , a hard x - ray component and a soft x - ray component .",
    "the fastest optically declining novae ( as measured by @xmath44 ) usually have an early hard x - ray phase , while the slower novae do not . the hard x - ray emission may originate from shocks between the fast moving ejecta and pre - existing circumstellar material , and typically is hard thermal bremsstrahlung ( @xmath72  k , low luminosity @xmath73 @xcite , and of shorter duration than the soft x - ray phase @xcite .",
    "the soft phase begins when the nova shell becomes optically thin and the photosphere of the nova recedes to the surface of the hot wd , with blackbody emission at @xmath74  k @xcite .",
    "this emission lasts as long as nuclear reactions continue on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "@xcite find that the super soft x - ray phase begins and ends sooner for fast novae ( as measured by @xmath44 ) than for slow novae and that novae with slower expansion velocities will enter the super soft state later but emit x - rays for longer .",
    "the correlation between super soft x - ray turn off time and @xmath44 has significant scatter @xcite , but if for sn2010u  @xmath0 d , then the turn - off time would be lower than 60 d and possibly as low as 10 d.    adopting a temperature of @xmath75 kev for the hard component of sn2010u  would place a @xmath33 upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of of @xmath76 , while adopting a temperature of @xmath77  ev for the soft component of sn2010u  would place a limit of @xmath78 . while neither of these limits are strong constraints , the upper limit on the super soft emission approaches the x - ray luminosities of some novae on record .",
    "@xcite found that for novav407cyg the blackbody luminosity of the super soft emission was @xmath79 at 27 d after optical maximum , and that nuclear burning on the surface of the wd occurred from eruption until about 30 d after optical maximum , meaning that sn2010u  could not have been much brighter in x - rays than novav407cyg . the deeper pre - explosion observation on 2007 march  26.50 of the field of sn2010u  placed a 3@xmath67 upper limit of @xmath80 , providing a weak upper limit on the luminosity of the nova system in quiescence .",

    "although there is no late time spectroscopy of sn2010u , the spectrum 15.94  d after maximum light already shows evidence of forbidden oxygen , with no evidence for any neon .",
    "this , combined with the presence of carbon and oxygen and the similarity of spectra to l91 , suggests that sn2010u  also had a carbon - oxygen wd progenitor .",
    "however , efforts to identify wd progenitor types are confounded by the possibility that an enriched envelope could exist on top of a co white dwarf , or that an onemg nova may or may not have a dredge - up event that would enrich the spectrum , producing a wide range of observable spectra . whether or not there is a direct mapping between the manifestation of the spectrum and the composition of the underlying wd is still an open question @xcite , although with detailed uv and x - ray spectral observations capturing the entirety of the nova outburst , such as in the case of l91 @xcite , it may be possible to tell .",
    "studies of novae have revealed a correlation between peak absolute magnitude @xmath132 and decline rate @xmath44 , termed the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline relationship ( mmrd ) .",
    "the shorter @xmath44 , the more intrinsically luminous the nova explosion @xcite .",
    "@xcite executed an extensive multi - year study of novae in m31 , discovering and spectroscopically classifying 46 novae , bringing the total of spectroscopically classified novae in m31 to 91 .",
    "they derive a mmrd for m31 novae and compare to other historical samples of novae ( figure  [ fig : mmrd_v ] ) @xcite .",

    "for example , @xcite find in their m31 survey that three of their four fastest declining novae are he / n type , although by number he / n novae comprise only @xmath133% of all novae .    despite claims that there might be a `` super - bright '' class of novae @xcite , @xcite find no evidence for a distinct population .",
    "however , sn2010u  is indeed a very luminous nova : compared to the 883 novae on record compiled by @xcite , only 4 novae are brighter , two of which are not spectroscopically confirmed @xcite . at the extreme end of the luminosity distribution there is large scatter from observational uncertainties such as intrinsic extinction and uncertainty in the capture of maximum light as well as uncertainties from intrinsic variability in the novae explosion due to variation in wd mass , accretion rate and metallicity @xcite .            surveys also find that novae with faster expansion velocities have a faster decline from maximum light ( figure  [ fig : vel_t2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the scatter in figure  [ fig : vel_t2 ] is likely due to the time dependence of velocities , which depends on how soon after maximum light the spectra was obtained .",
    "such a @xmath44 vs. h@xmath45  fwhm relationship is a natural outcome if he / n novae are the fastest declining and the most violent , having the highest ejecta velocities .",

    ", the nova population follows the galaxy light @xcite .",
    "surveys of multiple galaxies of different morphologies aim to determine whether novae properties such as peak brightness , @xmath44 , and spectral type correlate with the underlying stellar population .    in the milky way",
    ", @xcite find that he / n novae are concentrated at the galactic plane and are fast and bright , while novae are concentrated in the bulge and thick disk of the galaxy and are slow and dim .",
    "because younger stellar populations have on average more massive white dwarfs , disk novae should be more extreme ; therefore they claim that he / n novae are associated with a younger stellar population and that the novae are associated with an older stellar population .    in m31",
    ", @xcite find conflicting results with no compelling evidence that spectroscopic class depends on location within the galaxy .",
    "however , they did find that the spatial distribution he / n novae is slightly more extended than that of novae and that the spatial distribution of faster ( lower @xmath44 ) novae is slightly more extended than that of slower novae .    in m33 ,",
    "however , @xcite find that five of eight novae are of he / n or b hybrid novae , while only two are definitively of the class .",
    "hybrid novae initially have broad lines which then later are replaced by he / n lines .",
    "interestingly , the opposite evolution from he / n to has never been observed .",
    "they speculate that this statistically significant difference in the fraction of he / n to galactic and m31 novae could be a result of the underlying population of m33 , which is a bulgeless galaxy , and therefore would be expected to be dominated by a disk population .    to address whether or not the most luminous novae are associated with a particular stellar population , it is useful to investigate the associated stellar populations of l91 , m31n , and sn2010u .",
    "@xcite examine the region surrounding l91 and find that there are three clusters within @xmath134  pc with ages less than the young age of @xmath135  yr , and that the location of l91 is close to another fast nova , lmc 1977#2 . because the lmc is a bulgeless galaxy",
    ", we would expect it to be dominated by fast declining novae , and indeed it possesses a fast declining and fast ejecta population of novae @xcite .",
    "however , that the luminous nova l91 specifically came from a young stellar population is in tension with the prediction that novae are associated with older stellar populations .",
    "the location of m31n-2007 - 11d is at large galactocentric radius from the center of m31 and perhaps a member of the disk , although another luminous but less - studied nova m31n-2009 - 09b is close to the center of the galaxy .",

    "the stars within 100  pc of the location of the nova are dim and red , suggesting association with an evolved population .",
    "the spatial location of any younger main sequence stars is distinct from the location of the nova , suggesting it is not associated with a massive star population , although it could be an evolved and obscured lower mass agb star @xcite .",
    "if sn2010u  originated from an evolved population , this would follow the emerging trend that novae come from lower mass , older populations such as the bulge of m31 .",
    "based upon the theory of the mmrd ( see   [ sec : super_edd ] ) , the high intrinsic luminosity and fast temporal evolution of sn2010u  signal that the progenitor was a high mass wd .",
    "the evolutionary channels of how the binary system could reach its pre - outburst state depend on when the wd was born .",
    "the wd could be born massive from a massive star , or alternatively the wd could have formed from a less massive star and accreted material .",
    "if the wd was born massive , there is a higher chance that it would be an onemg wd .",
    "some claim that `` neon novae , '' which exhibit strong [ ] and [ ] lines during the forbidden phase , and thus have a high neon abundance , originate from onemg wds @xcite , although it is unclear whether or not these lines could be produced by an enriched surface layer and be uncorrelated with wd composition @xcite .",
    "the nova models of @xcite are able to produce the full range of observed nova characteristics ( @xmath132 , @xmath44 , @xmath138 ) using only co wd progenitors , however with onemg wd progenitors they were able to produce ejecta envelopes that were enriched in neon by @xmath139 times compared to co wds .",
    "surveys have established that most luminous and fast novae are he / n novae , however , sn2010u , l91 , and m31n are all novae .",
    "@xcite speculate that what may set these novae apart is their long rise time compared to the general nova population , which reaches maximum light in less than 3 days .",
    "@xcite hypothesize that the long rise time is indicative of a large amount of ejected mass , such that the photons take a long time to diffuse and escape .",
    "for l91 , @xcite found @xmath140 with a progenitor of a high mass , cool wd with a low metallicity envelope .",
    "@xcite speculate that a long rise time may be related to the formation of the spectrum , which is formed in an optically thick wind driven by residual burning on the surface of the wd .",
    "@xcite proposed that the mmrd is primarily a function of the mass of the wd progenitor .",
    "if the wd is more massive , the surface layers will be more degenerate and allow a more intense but also more rapid expulsion of material .",
    "recent studies suggest that the outburst properties additionally depend sensitively upon other parameters of the progenitor system such as the temperature of the isothermal core and the accretion rate of material onto the surface of the wd .",
    "@xcite calculate the ignition mass of the accreted material on the surface of the wd , @xmath141 , and its dependence on the mass transfer rate @xmath142 to the wd , and the wd mass .",
    "the temperature of the wd core , @xmath143 , also influences @xmath141 ; however , @xcite find that @xmath143 is set uniquely by @xmath142 , and therefore @xmath141 is primarily a function of only two parameters .",
    "a lower @xmath144 leads to a lower @xmath143 , which then increases the @xmath141 needed to start the nova eruption .",
    "alternatively , a high @xmath145 will trigger the thermonuclear runaway earlier ; at extremely high @xmath142 , stable hydrogen burning can occur @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that very low accretion rates can produce the most extreme nova explosions , which are characterized by super - eddington luminosities at maximum , large ejecta velocities , fast optical decline , and if the wd is of moderate mass , large ejecta masses .",
    "the extreme luminosities and rapid photometric declines of l91 , m31n , and sn2010u  suggest that these novae all originated from massive wds .",
    "@xcite claim that l91 had a @xmath146 wd . comparing the outburst characteristics ( @xmath44 , bolometric luminosity , and ejecta velocity ) of sn2010u  to the grid of theoretical predictions made by @xcite , we find that only the models with massive ( @xmath147 ) and cool ( @xmath148  k ) white dwarfs accreting at a very low rate ( @xmath149 ) are able to reproduce these parameters .",
    "@xcite speculate that the large luminosity of l91 , which would otherwise be inconsistent with the large ejecta mass , could be the result of a traveling shock wave through colliding ejecta shells .",
    "as described in @xcite , there is a discrete low density and high velocity shell and an optically thick wind which is powered by nuclear burning of residual material on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "he / n spectra are dominated by the discrete component , while novae are dominated by the wind component .",
    "a more massive ejecta shell would be more likely to have residual material which to burn on the surface of the wd , and may explain why the massive ejecta of l91 and likely massive ejecta of sn2010u  result in novae .",
    "the rise times of novae are generally longer than that of those predicted by spherically symmetric models , which suggests that time might be needed for the local thermonuclear runaway to proceed over the surface of the white dwarf @xcite , and may result in an asymmetric outburst .",
    "@xcite observe transient absorption features in high resolution line profiles of balmer and lines in other novae that are likely due to discrete absorption components , such as a small cloud of high density passing in front of the continuum source , suggesting the outburst is inhomogeneous .",
    "clumpy ejecta would increase the effective eddington limit and allow the nova outburst to sustain apparently super - eddington luminosities for a period of time @xcite .",
    "given that nova ejecta are inhomogeneous and quickly evolving with time , it is likely that the super - eddington novae l91 and sn2010u  sustained their remarkable luminosities through a porous photosphere or asymmetric explosion .",
    "although he / n novae are preferentially brighter than novae , there are several very luminous novae , in particular l91 , m31n , and sn2010u .",
    "although the mmrd and population studies suggest that novae should predominately come from older stellar populations which have on average smaller mass wds , this mapping between white dwarf and spectral type must not necessarily be direct .",
    "when a binary stellar system will evolve to a configuration that can produce a nova outburst is not a simple function of the mass or age of the dwarf , but is dependent upon the orbital parameters and stellar evolution of the binary system itself , for example , when the orbit might decay or the donor might evolve to fill its roche lobe and begin mass transfer .",
    "bright novae like l91 , m31n , and sn2010u  may represent unique binary systems with cool , high mass co white dwarfs accreting material from their companions at a very low rate .",
    "sn2010u  was a luminous ( peak @xmath1 mag ) and fast declining ( @xmath0 d ) classical nova in the galaxy ngc4214 .",
    "optical spectroscopy revealed that it was an type nova with strong hydrogen balmer emission and expansion velocities of order @xmath39 .",
    "p  cygni spectral line profiles in spectra taken near maximum light indicate that the emission was optically thick and early photometry indicates that the optical emission was approximately thermal blackbody with @xmath150  k. as the nova faded , the spectrum evolved to a nebular state dominated by emission lines and [ ] emission began to appear .",
    "our conclusions are the following :    1 .",
    "sn2010u  was a fast and luminous nova , among the top 0.5% brightest of all historical outbursts and the third brightest nova for which spectroscopic information exists .",
    "it is remarkably similar to both nova lmc 1991 ( l91 ) and m31n-2007 - 11d ( m31n ) in photometry and spectra .",
    "sn2010u  is a type nova .",
    "novae are characteristically dimmer and slower to decline ( longer @xmath44 ) than he / n .",
    "the existence of bright and fast novae like sn2010u , l91 , and m31n are interesting outliers in trends which aim to correlate spectral type with outburst properties .",
    "sn2010u  reached super - eddington luminosities during the peak of its outburst .",
    "most novae are sub - eddington , however l91 was also super - eddington for an extended period of time while it ejected a large amount of mass .",
    "it is likely that the spectrum , which is formed in an optically thick wind , is related to high mass loss .",
    "4 .   massive and luminous nova outbursts like sn2010u  probe a unique set of progenitor parameters , and point to an extreme region of parameter space with low accretion rate , high white dwarf mass , and low white dwarf core temperature .",
    "the extreme luminosity region of the mmrd is poorly constrained and subject to high scatter .",
    "5 .   that sn2010u  likely originated from a co wd associated with an evolved stellar population is interesting in the context of the debate of nova populations and the manifestation of nova spectral type .",
    "trends in the milky way , the lmc , and m33 suggest that more luminous novae of the he",
    "/ n type originate from young stellar populations where average white dwarf mass is higher . however , l91 , m31n , and sn2010u  all are extremely luminous novae that are likely from massive co white dwarfs",
    ". various paths of binary evolution can influence when these systems will enter a configuration that would generate nova outbursts .",
    "upcoming wide - field transient surveys like lsst will discover optical transients in ever greater numbers .",
    "in particular , the high cadence and deep optical limits of the survey will reveal many classical novae , which have traditionally been difficult to study because of moderate luminosities and fast decline from maximum light .",
    "understanding the extreme quadrant of high luminosity and rapid optical decline for classical novae is paramount for maximizing the scientific return of large photometric surveys , for which spectroscopic resources will not be available to confirm every discovery . accurately characterizing the intermediate luminosity phase space",

    "<S> we find typical ejecta velocities of @xmath2 and that sn2010u  shares many spectral and photometric characteristics with two other fast and luminous type novae , including nova lmc 1991 and m31n-2007 - 11d . </S>",
    "<S> for the extreme luminosity of this nova , the maximum magnitude vs. rate of decline relationship indicates a massive white dwarf progenitor with a low pre - outburst accretion rate . </S>",
