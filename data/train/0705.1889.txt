    "the term _ magnetic dot array _ ( mda )  @xcite refers to the family of nano - scaled monolayer structures consisting of the identical magnetic nanoparticles , called dots , which are periodically ordered on a non - magnetic substrate .",
    "mda concept is compelling , partly because of qualitatively new properties , that essentially differ from those of the bulk materials .",
    "typical for mda physics is an intricate collective behavior .",
    "its understanding may be valuable for condensed matter physics , material science and nanoscience .",
    "the special properties of mda systems follow from the interplay between intra - dot and inter - dot interactions as well as from the interplay of anomalously large surface compared to the bulk magnetic energy contributions  @xcite .",
    "the mda properties are already utilized in technological applications concerning magnetic field sensors  @xcite and reading heads of magnetic - disk data - storage devices @xcite .",
    "the technology of fabrication of mdas  @xcite has been perfected to an excellent degree in the past few years . in practice , however , an occurrence of technological defects and local irregularities has still a great influence on all of the magnetic properties  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study how the imperfection in form of the single - dot vacancy affects remagnetization of mda under the assistance of thermal activation .    in the series of papers  @xcite the authors focus on remagnetization of small segments of arrays by simulating elementary models where dots are treated as interacting point dipoles . in ref.@xcite",
    "we draw the effect of uniaxial anisotropy induced by the eccentrically placed node defect .",
    "later  @xcite we have investigated how the central defect affects the quasi - static zero - temperature remagnetization of mda . from this study we know that : ( i )  the square lattice seems to be more sensitive to defect occurrence than the triangular one ; ( ii )  zero - temperature differences of hysteresis loops are not very pronounced despite of the remarkable changes in the local arrangement of dots .",
    "in addition , the study has opened question of defect influence on the relaxation modes .    in the present study",
    "the effect of nonmagnetic central - node defect , in further referred as _ defect _ only , is reconsidered . however , the additional realistic factor included here is the thermal activation . in such case",
    "the statistical treatment of results is necessary .",
    "therefore , in order to discern defect consequences , two distinct mda arrangements -_defect - free _  ( df ) and _ defect - including _  ( di ) are compared .",
    "because the statistical simulations need computational effort we preferred use of elementary model where each dot is described by the point magnetic dipole .",
    "this simplification is justified for monodomain isotropic nearly spherical ferromagnetic particles separated by a sufficient lattice spacing several times exceeding a dot diameter . additionally , we focus on the small mda samples where dots are placed on square @xmath1 lattice .",
    "the magnetic state of @xmath2-th dot is described by the effective rescaled 3d magnetic moment @xmath3 normalized as @xmath4 .",
    "the inter - dot interactions are assumed to be dipolar and described by the effective field @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance between @xmath2-th and @xmath7-th dot in lattice - spacing units @xmath8 .",
    "the field is measured in the @xmath9 units including the dot volume @xmath10 and saturated magnetization @xmath11 . to study the di arrangement we assume that defect is represented by the zero magnetic moment .",
    "the dynamics of magnetic moments is described by the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimensionless damping parameter , @xmath14 is the time in @xmath15^{-1}$ ] units and @xmath16 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the effective field @xmath17 includes the dipolar field @xmath18 , the external field @xmath19 , and the langevin thermal field @xmath20 .",
    "finally @xmath21 .",
    "the random thermal field @xmath20 is defined by averages @xcite    [ sprop ] @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath2 , @xmath7 are the site indexes ; @xmath24 is the noise amplitude . according to fluctuation - dissipation relation  @xcite , the factor @xmath24 is linked to the temperature @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the characteristic temperature scale .",
    "in all of our numerical experiments we set @xmath28 for mda . the main empirical argument supporting our choice @xmath29 is that ferrite nanoparticles have the mean value of @xmath13 of such order  @xcite .",
    "let us first study the remagnetization in df and di systems in the time varying external magnetic field applied in parallel to one of the main mda axes @xmath30 . for simulated geometry",
    "similarly as in the hypothetical experimental setup the quantity of interest is the magnetization projection @xmath31 .",
    "the component @xmath32 has been cycled within the bounds @xmath33 .",
    "the simulation starts from the nearly saturated state with @xmath34 at @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the bound chosen to keep the system of moments saturated . in the remagnetization regime",
    "each time - integration step @xmath37 is accompanied by the unique change of the external field @xmath38 . both quantities",
    "define the sweeping rate @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "we observed that numerical results depend on the sweeping rate .",
    "numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ sllg ] ) has been performed using stochastic predictor - corrector heun scheme @xcite .",
    "this choice is justified by the fact that in general , the statistical error of the scheme can be made arbitrarily small by averaging over the number of stochastic paths  @xcite .",
    "we tested numerical stability of scheme for two different integration steps . in order to fix @xmath41 ,",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath43 have been rescaled by @xmath44 .",
    "the test confirmed the invariance of statistical results with respect to the rescaling . under the conditions of thermal activation we recorded and treated assembly of @xmath45 independent loops .",
    "the treatment assumes averaging of the magnetization data conditioned by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . in fig.[mloops ] we show averaged loops constructed for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we see that loops differ for di mda and df mda variants .",
    "the difference confirms some anomalous impact of the local assymetry of the couplings broken by defect .",
    "clearly , by increasing the temperature the hysteresis vanishes due to reduction of the impact of irreversible processes due to configurations separated by energy barriers .    ,",
    "( b )  @xmath51 , ( c )  @xmath52 . ]",
    "when assume standardly that the amount of free energy responsible for the irreversible processes is proportional to the area @xmath53 of hysteresis loop . according fig.[areas ] the thermally induced hysteresis reveals maximum of the ratio @xmath54 at @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that for sufficiently high temperatures the differences between di and df systems vanish .",
    "since the remagnetization process of mdas is very inhomogeneous we analyzed the local mean magnetic hysteresis for nearest neighborhood of central node , corners and middle nodes of mda edges .",
    "the local loops differ among each other . from their comparison",
    "it follows that defect affects not only hysteresis of its nearest neighbor dots , but also hysteresis at corners and edges , that clearly follows from the long - range nature of magnetostatic couplings .",
    "one can expect that averaging eliminates some kind of the relevant defect - sensitive information .",
    "therefore , it seems valuable to pay attention to the fluctuations around the averaged loops . to do this we analyzed the noise formed by returns",
    "@xmath56 accumulated during reversals .",
    "also this data have been treated separately for @xmath57 and @xmath58 sweeps .",
    "evidently , the probability density functions of returns exhibit defect sensitivity .",
    "they has been quantitatively characterized by the parameters of leptocurticity @xmath59 and skewness @xmath60 .",
    "their numerical values are listed in table.[tab : ks ] .",
    ".statistical characteristics of the magnetization returns .",
    "the leptocurticity and skewness obtained from fluctuations of hysteresis at different temperatures . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the values clearly indicate that magnetization noise is strongly non - gaussian .",
    "we see that temperature affects the characteristics in common manner , they decrease .",
    "however , the remarkable differences between df and di systems exist again .",
    "the reversal magnetization paths uncovered complex collective inner behavior of dot moments . in addition the thermal fluctuations cause that single remagnetization events qualitatively differ between each other .",
    "we observed that intervals with smoothly varying magnetization , where the quasi - coherent rotation of moments prevails , are broken by the irreversible jumps .",
    "to understand redundant but essential attributes of the reversal statistics we exploited the abilities of artificial neural networks .",
    "the most efficient for our purposes seems to be the usage of unsupervised self - organizing maps ( som )  @xcite that allow us to extract several representative paths from the largely redundant assembly . in fig.[koh ] we show the representative paths ( @xmath48 ) extracted by som . for certain inner parameters of som the classification yields two representative groups of loops ( classification is done for df and di cases separately ) .",
    "the quantitative output of this analysis is that the averaged loops from fig .",
    "[ mloops](a ) can be understood as a mixture of 89% of ( a1 ) constituent with small addition of 11% of ( a2 ) in df case , and 65% of ( b1 ) with 35% contribution of ( b2 ) in di case .",
    "this classification explains why the patterns ( a1 ) , ( b1 ) are much more similar to the averaged loops than less probable types ( a2 ) , ( b2 ) .     revealed by som network for df and di array .",
    "the boldface branches belong to @xmath61 . ]    by analyzing the revealed loops we conclude that two massive magnetization jumps contribute to the reversal .",
    "deeper insight to the mechanism of their nucleation is offered by the configuration of moments .",
    "the sequence of snapshots that correspond to @xmath58 regime is shown in fig.[conf ] .",
    "we see that the defect evidently supports the nucleation of the intermediate inter - dot _ leaf_. without defect the noncolinear antiferromagnetic order is prefered .",
    "equal to ( 1 ) 1.5 , ( 2 ) 0.0 , ( 3 ) -1.0 , ( 4 ) -3.0 . ]",
    "the additional principle of defect detection is provided by relaxation process in zero external field starting from @xmath62 state .",
    "the relaxation curves for df and di systems are plotted in fig.[rel ] . for @xmath63",
    "the qualitative differences in the relaxation of magnetization become clear .",
    "the most anomalous aspect of relaxation of di is the pronounced peak .",
    "however , df mda does not exhibit this feature .",
    "the configurations show that in df case the pair of antiparallel vortices is formed in contrast to inter - dot flower observed in di case . as for the hysteresis , when the energy barriers are over bridged by thermal fluctuations ,",
    "the transition to relaxation mode without peak is expected .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by the inset of fig .",
    "[ rel ] , where the nearly exponential relaxation occurs without substantial marks of defect sensitivity .    .",
    "inset corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "the final curves are averages obtained from 1000 stochastic relaxation events . ]",
    "the simulation statistical study discusses the theoretical grounds for defect detection in mda .",
    "it has been shown , that that the presence of non - magnetic central node defect in a a small segment of mda has non - negligible influence on dynamical properties of mda , concretely magnetic hysteresis and relaxation .",
    "further , it shows that the including the thermal activation is not only the additional factor of realistic simulation , but also the factor that can substantially enhance the chance to identify defect ."
