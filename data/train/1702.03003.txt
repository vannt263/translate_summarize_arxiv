    "the optimum photon energy to maximize transmitted flux is about 30 kev for total flux and 23 kev for coherent flux .",
    "one can see that the coherent flux available from the aps upgrade will approach the total flux now available , so all of the surface x - ray scattering techniques currently in use will be feasible with coherent x - ray beams .    anticipating the advent of these capabilities ,",

    "the upper chamber sections , consisting of the window section ( green ) and the inlet section ( magenta ) , are rotationally fixed with respect to the hexapod mobile platform by a fork ( 4 ) and pin ( 5 ) coupling .",
    "these upper sections do not rotate with _ phi _ when the sample / sample heater rotates .",
    "the gas inlet , exhaust , and cooling water piping thus require only limited flexibility to follow the tilting and translation of the hexapod mobile platform during scattering experiments .",
    "fused quartz tubes assembled with o - ring seals are used for the following items : the x - ray transparent chamber wall ( 6 ) ; the low - thermal - expansion support for the heated sample mount ( 7 ) ; and the input flow tubes for group iii ( 8) and group v ( 9 ) channels .",
    "the quartz tube forming the x - ray transparent chamber wall has a 70 mm inner diameter and 2 mm wall thickness .",
    "this is sufficiently transparent at x - ray photon energies above 20 kev , while being sufficiently strong to have a safe operating pressure range from vacuum to 3.75 atm above ambient ( 55 psig ) .",
    "input flow tubes of different lengths can be used to adjust the path length of the interdiffusion region .",
    "all o - ring seals in the system are made of nitrile polymer to be compatible with nh@xmath2 .",
    "the sample ( 10 ) rests in a 0.25 mm deep , 15 mm @xmath4 15 mm square indentation in the molybdenum sample mounting block ( 11 ) , which itself sits on the low - thermal - expansion fused quartz support tube ( 7 ) .",
    "a resistive heater ( 12 ) made of boron - nitride - encased graphite@xcite is attached to the underside of the sample mounting block .",
    "the lower face of the heater is insulated with heat shields made of thin molybdenum sheets . a type - k thermocouple ( 13 ) encased in an inconel sheath",

    "electrical power for the heater is provided by molybdenum leads ( 14 ) insulated by ceramic beads that connect to feedthroughs ( 15 ) in the bottom flange .",
    "the thermocouple and heater power leads are hand - formed into a loose spiral inside the support quartz .",
    "the spiral provides a spring tension to hold the sample mounting block firmly in place on the quartz support during operation . during assembly and disassembly ,",

    "for sample loading and unloading , the chamber top opens at an iso flange ( 19 ) separating the inlet section ( magenta ) from the window section ( green ) .",
    "the assembled chamber can be mounted or dismounted from the _ phi _ goniometer using the bolt circle ( 20 ) attached to the sample heater section .",
    "a 10-mm - diameter on - axis port ( 21 ) on the inlet section provides a view normal to the sample surface through the group iii input tube .",
    "typically an optical lens is mounted and the port may be used for near - normal incidence optical measurements , such as interferometric measurements of film growth or temperature calibration , as described in section  [ sec : char ] . alternatively , an x - ray transparent be window can be mounted to allow monitoring of x - ray fluorescence , including lower energies that would not penetrate the quartz chamber wall .",
    "the chamber top inlet section has three inlet - flow ports for the group v ( 22 ) and group iii ( 23 ) flows , and a window curtain flow ( 24 ) that minimizes deposition on the x - ray transparent chamber walls .",
    "distribution channels inside the inlet section inject the flows symmetrically around the chamber axis . a funnel - shaped section of the chamber wall ( 25 ) below the window and concentric baffles downstream of the sample ( 26 )",
    "are designed to maintain a radial flow pattern over the sample . a heater purge inlet flow ( 27 )",

    "all flows exit the chamber to the pressure control valve and pump through a relatively large ( 20 mm diameter ) exhaust port ( 28 ) .",
    "x - ray measurements require independent , high resolution positioning of a sample and detector system in a six - dimensional space ( three positional coordinates and three angular components ) .",
    "traditionally , the motions of both the sample and detector have been integrated into a single x - ray diffractometer .",
    "however , emerging x - ray techniques have very different requirements for stability , and in particular relative stability , of the sample and detector . for coherent x - ray scattering measurements utilizing an area detector , the stability of the sample with respect to the incident x - ray beam must be better than a fraction of the beam size , e.g. one micron , over the course of the measurement . at the same time , the area detector position must be stable to a fraction of a pixel ( e.g. 25 microns ) at a long distance from the sample position ( typically a meter or greater ) so that x - ray speckles can be resolved .",
    "these requirements have driven instrument design for coherent x - ray measurements to use separate sample and detector positioners .",
    "in addition to stability , advanced coherent diffraction imaging techniques such as ptychography@xcite require that the sample be reproducibly raster - scanned with respect to the incident beam with sub - micron repeatability .    however , in addition to coherent x - ray measurements , a goal of the current instrument design is also to support full - field imaging @xcite based on new x - ray optics ( e.g. compound refractive lenses ) . for full field imaging ,",
    "the relative stability of the detector optics and sample position become critical while the position of the sample with respect to the incident beam is much less critical ( the opposite of that required for coherent x - ray scattering ) .",
    "in addition , being able to position the imaging optics close to the sample position is required to get appropriate numerical apertures and spatial resolutions .    to achieve these competing goals ,",
    "a diffractometer system has been designed with three separate components to position the sample , a near detector , and a far detector .",

    "after carefully analyzing requirements , we considered several different motion solutions .",
    "the use of complete goniometers to provide angular motions was rejected because prototype designs did nt allow for suitable sample access .",
    "the use of arcs was rejected because the necessary stability was difficult and expensive to achieve . after considering several compound motion solutions",

    "however , its future installation has been facilitated by not permanently mounting any critical components on the back wall of the hutch .",

    "equal make - up flows for each channel can be counter - switched simultaneously to keep the process and vent flows constant .",
    "there are six group iii channels available , with bubbler or compressed - gas precursor sources .",
    "this provides the flexibility to study the formation of alloys and heterointerfaces using different condensed - phase precursors such as triethyl gallium ( tega ) , trimethyl indium ( tmin ) , trimethyl aluminum ( tmal ) , and dopants such as disilane gas . to provide a wide range of precursor flow rates into the chamber , on five channels",
    "the flow from the source can be diluted , with excess bypassing the chamber through a back pressure regulator .",
    "most of the gas handling system , including the group iii switching manifold and the group v sources , is located inside a large ventilated cabinet on the side wall of the shielded x - ray enclosure , several meters from the chamber .",

    "in addition to the ventilated enclosures housing most components of the gas handling system , a movable ventilation snorkel is located above the chamber to mitigate the risk of leaks at the chamber .",
