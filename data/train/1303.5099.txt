    "the morphological properties of a growing film by vapor techniques are mainly determined by the balance between substrate / film temperature and pressure .",
    "high temperature helps the system to attain equilibrium states , for instance favoring formation of smooth surfaces in homoepitaxy , while the increase of pressure leads to faster adsorption and drives the system far from the equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , many statistical models of thin film growth represent the competition of the external flux of atoms or molecules and temperature - dependent surface processes , such as diffusion , aggregation , and reactions @xcite .    the main quantity to characterize",
    "surface morphology is the roughness , which measures thickness fluctuations along the film surface .",
    "it may be measured for the whole surface ( global roughness ) or inside a box that slides on that surface ( local roughness ) .",
    "the scaling properties with time and size are described by dynamic relations @xcite , which are called normal when local and global fluctuations scale with the same exponents @xcite and anomalous when local and global exponents are different @xcite .",
    "a question of experimental relevance is the effect of changing physico - chemical conditions during film growth .",
    "for example , a recent experimental work on electrodeposition of prussian blue films interpreted the growth as a process dominated by surface diffusion in which the time - increasing adsorption rate is responsible for an anomaly in the dynamic scaling relation @xcite .",
    "the problem of spontaneous fluid imbibition in a porous medium is another system that shows anomalous scaling ( as ) and is modeled as interface growth with time - dependent couplings @xcite .",
    "this scenario motivated theoretical works on growth models where the microscopic rules of aggregation change in time .",
    "@xcite showed that a sudden change in the parameters of the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) growth equation @xcite may be responsible for nontrivial effects in roughness scaling , such as power - law relaxation to steady states .",
    "the as in stochastic growth equations with time - dependent couplings was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and illustrated for the ew equation with time - dependent surface tension , showing good agreement with numerical results for models of spontaneous imbibition @xcite . in lattice models of film growth , as was recently shown in competitive models with time - varying probabilities @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , to our knowledge no work have already discussed the effects of time - varying temperature in thin film deposition .",
    "for this reason , this paper is devoted to study a model of deposition and diffusion of adsorbed species in which the diffusion coefficients are affected by a time - dependent substrate / film temperature .",
    "for simplicity , the model assumes that only adatoms in terraces can move , while atoms with lateral neighbors are permanently aggregated .",
    "a combination of a theoretical approach and simulation results shows several nontrivial effects on surface roughness scaling that may help to understand experimental results . in cases of decreasing temperature",
    ", there is evidence of as for film thicknesses typical of real mesoscopically thick films .",
    "moreover , the global roughness has a nontrivial evolution which does not allow a reliable calculation of a growth exponent . in cases of increasing temperature",
    ", a non - monotonic evolution of the global roughness may be observed , possibly with a saturation for a wide range of film thickness .",
    "the main advance from previous works is to show those features in feasible conditions of film growth , since the model is an approximate description of low - temperature physical vapor deposition .",
    "possible extensions to deposition models with several activation energy barriers suggest that the same features may be observed in similar conditions .",

    "the model studied in this work was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . it is a solid - on - solid type model ( no overhang in the film surface ) and the deposit has a simple cubic lattice structure .",
    "the substrate is flat , at the @xmath3 plane , with linear size @xmath4 ( @xmath5 columns ) , with the lattice parameter being the length unit .",
    "the column height is the @xmath6 coordinate of the topmost adatom .",
    "there is an external flux of @xmath7 atoms per site per unit time , measured in number of monolayers ( ml ) per second .",
    "an incident atom is adsorbed upon landing above a previously deposited atom or a substrate site .",
    "all adsorbed atoms with no lateral and no upper neighbor diffuse with coefficient @xmath8 ( number of steps per unit time ) . if an adatom has a lateral or an upper neighbor , then it is permanently aggregated at that position . fig .",
    "1 illustrates the possible steps of some mobile atoms at the film surface .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 depends on temperature as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a jump frequency and @xmath11 is the activation energy in a flat surface , which typically amounts to tenths of @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 quantitatively represents the interplay between temperature and pressure and determines the film properties .",
    "the other relevant parameter is the film thickness @xmath14 , proportional to the deposition time .    in the submonolayer growth regime",
    ", this model corresponds to irreversible island growth with critical nucleus of size @xmath15 , which was already applied to several systems @xcite .",
    "the irreversible lateral aggregation is a reasonable assumption for low temperature or large atomic flux , although it does not respect detailed balance conditions .",
    "this model also has the advantage of reducing simulation times compared with models where all atoms are mobile .",
    "the aggregation condition is similar to the das sarma and tamborenea ( dt ) model of molecular beam epitaxy @xcite , but the main difference is that the dt model and its extensions restrict the adatom diffusion to finite distances .",
    "moreover , the model does not consider ehrlich - schwebel ( es ) barriers for downhill movement at terrace edges @xcite and does not allow uphill movement because adatoms with lateral neighbors are immobile . indeed , our aim is to consider a model with a minimal set of relevant parameters , in order to search for features that are intrinsically related to the time - varying temperature .",
    "simulation results presented here were obtained in lattices with @xmath16 .",
    "some results were also obtained in @xmath17 and @xmath18 in order to confirm that finite - size effects are negligible in the simulated time range .",
    "fixed deposition parameters are @xmath19 and the activation energy @xmath20 .",
    "these values are reasonable compared to experimental data for several metals and semiconductors , although the direct applicability is limited due to the differences in lattice structure and aggregation assumptions @xcite .",
    "choosing a fixed value of @xmath11 and changing @xmath21 does not restrict our conclusions because the physically important parameter is @xmath22 , which is a function of @xmath23 . in all cases ,",
    "the temperature is uniform across the film and may vary in time . some results for fixed temperature are also obtained for comparison .",
    "we will consider temperature values in which @xmath22 ranges between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these values are small if compared to works on submonolayer growth , which frequently consider @xmath22 up to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "however , they are suitable for low temperature deposition , which is a necessary condition for the applicability of a model with irreversible attachment to steps ( in other words , even with a small binding energy to a lateral neighbor , the relative probability of an attached atom to move will be small ) . for @xmath27 , results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that adatoms execute an average of @xmath28 random steps before aggregation , thus diffusion lengths in terraces are much smaller than the lateral size of the films and finite - size effects are negligible .    during the growth of a sample , the adsorption of each new atom takes place in a time interval @xmath29 . after this process",
    ", @xmath30 steps of randomly chosen free atoms are performed . since @xmath30 is usually not integer , and it may be small for large @xmath4 , we keep its fractional part for determining the number of steps after the next adsorption events . if the temperature changes during the film growth , then the value of @xmath22 is updated after the deposition of each complete layer ( @xmath31 atoms ) , which corresponds to a unit time interval .",
    "the global roughness ( or interface width ) is defined as @xmath32 where the overbars represent spatial averages and the angular brackets represent configurational averages over various samples . for short deposition times ( small thicknesses ) , effects of the finite substrate size @xmath4 are negligible and @xmath33 scales as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is called the growth exponent .    for comparison with experimental data , the local roughness @xmath36 is more useful .",
    "it is also defined as a root mean square height fluctuation , but the spatial average is limited to a box of size @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , and the configurational average is performed by gliding this box over the film surface and over various samples . in the regime of thin film growth ( negligible effects of substrate size ) , it follows the family - vicsek ( fv ) dynamic scaling relation @xcite @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the local roughness exponent ( sometimes called hurst exponent ) , @xmath6 is the dynamic exponent , @xmath41 is a constant , and @xmath42 is a scaling function such that @xmath43 for @xmath44 ( small box size ) and @xmath45 for @xmath46 ( large box size , where the local roughness coincides with the global one ) .    in systems with normal",

    "moreover , our results shown very good agreement with theoretical predictions in all the cases studied . in the growth regime , that approach may help to predict conditions for observing the same phenomena observed here , such as as and rapid roughness increase ( large @xmath111 ) for decreasing temperature and roughness oscillations for increasing temperature .    finally , we note that results equivalent to the ones obtained with varying temperature ( i. e. varying @xmath8 ) may be obtained with variable flux @xmath7 , since the main parameter of our model is the ratio @xmath22 .",
