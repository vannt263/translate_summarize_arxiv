    "extracting the full physical content from einstein s equations has proven to be a difficult task .",
    "the complexity of these equations has allowed researchers only a peek into the rich phenomenology of the theory by assuming special symmetries and reductions .",
    "computational methods , however , are opening a new window into the theory . to realize the full utility of computational solutions in exploring einstein s equations , several questions must first be addressed .",
    "namely , a deeper understanding of the system of equations and its boundary conditions , the development and use of more refined numerical techniques and an efficient use of the available computational resources .    in recent years",
    ", considerable advances have been made in some of these issues , allowing for the analysis of complex physical systems which arguably must be tackled numerically . in the present article",
    "we highlight some recent analytical and numerical techniques and apply them to two practical applications .",
    "the first application is the _ numerical evolution of bubble spacetimes in five - dimensional kaluza - klein theory_. we study their dynamical behavior , the validity of cosmic censorship in a set - up which a - priori would appear promising to give rise to violations of the conjecture and reveal the existence of critical phenomena . as a second application",
    ", we discuss the _ numerical evolution of single black hole spacetimes_. here we consider some analytical and numerical difficulties in modeling these systems accurately .",
    "we discuss a method to alleviate some of these problems , and present tests to demonstrate the promise of this method .",
    "in the cauchy formulation of general relativity , einstein s field equations are split into evolution and constraint equations .",
    "numerical solutions are found by specifying data on an initial spacelike slice , subject to the constraints , and by integrating the evolution equations to obtain the future development of the data . owing to finite computer resources ,",
    "one is forced to use finite , and , in practice , rather small computational domains to discretize the problem .",
    "this raises several important issues .",
    "the fundamental property for any useful numerical solution is that the solution must convergence to the continuum solution in the limit of infinite resolution .",
    "a prerequisite for a well - behaved numerical solution is a well - posed continuum formulation of the initial - boundary value problem . in certain cases ,",
    "the well - posed continuum problem can then be used to construct stable numerical discretizations for which one can _ a priori _ guarantee convergence .",
    "in particular , this can be achieved for linear , first - order , symmetric hyperbolic systems with maximally dissipative boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "this is briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect : sbp ] , for a detailed description and an extension to numerical relativity see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the application of these ideas in general relativity is , naturally , more complicated .",
    "first , einstein s equations are nonlinear and so it is much harder to _ a priori _ prove convergence .",
    "however , a discretization that guarantees stability for the linearized equations should already be useful for the nonlinear equations , especially for those systems with smooth solutions as expected for the einstein equations when written appropriately .",
    "this is because in a small enough neighborhood of any given spacelike slice , the numerical solution can be modeled as a small amplitude perturbation of the continuum solution .",
    "the constraint equations in general relativity bring additional complications and greatly restrict the freedom in specifying boundary and initial data .",
    "this is illustrated and further discussed in section  [ sect : cpbc ] .",
    "section  [ sect : dyncontrol ] discusses issues regarding the stability of the constraint manifold .",
    "the manifold is invariant with respect to the flow defined by the evolution system in the continuum problem .",
    "numerically , however , small errors in the solution arising from truncation or roundoff error may lead to large constraint violations if the constraint manifold is unstable .",
    "section  [ sect : dyncontrol ] discusses a method for suppressing such rapid constraint violations .",
    "a simple numerical algorithm , or `` recipe , '' can be followed to solve first order , linear symmetric hyperbolic equations with variable coefficients and maximally dissipative boundary conditions , for which stability can be guaranteed .",
    "it is based on finite difference approximations with spatial difference operators that satisfy the _ summation by parts _ ( sbp ) property .",
    "this property is a discrete analogous of _ integration by parts _ ,",
    "which is used in the derivation of energy estimates , a key ingredient for obtaining a well posed formulation of the continuum problem .",
    "sbp allows to obtain similar energy estimates for the discrete problem .",
    "[ [ employ - spatial - difference - operators - that - satisfy - sbp - on - the - computational - domain . ] ] employ spatial difference operators that satisfy sbp on the computational domain .    for the sake of simplicity",

    "let us introduce the discrete scalar product , @xmath4 for some positive definite matrix with elements @xmath5 which in the continuum limit @xmath6 approaches the @xmath7 norm @xmath8 .",
    "at the continuum level , the derivative operator @xmath9 and scalar product satisfy integration by parts , i.e. @xmath10 , which in the discrete case is translated into a finite difference operator @xmath11 which satisfies @xmath12 and approaches @xmath9 in the continuum limit .",
    "the simplest difference operator and scalar product satisfying sbp are @xmath13 where the scalar product is diagonal : @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "higher order operators satisfying sbp have been constructed by strand  @xcite .",
    "additionally , when dealing with non - trivial domains containing inner boundaries , additional complexities must be addressed to attain sbp , see ref .",
    "@xcite . the finite operator @xmath11 is then used for the discretization of the spatial derivatives in the evolution equations , thus obtaining a semi - discrete system .",
    "[ [ impose - boundary - conditions - via - orthogonal - projections . ] ] impose boundary conditions via orthogonal projections  @xcite .",
    "this ensures the consistent treatment of the boundaries , guaranteeing the correct handling of modes propagating towards , from and tangential to the boundaries .",

    "[ [ implement - an - appropriate - time - integration - algorithm . ] ] implement an appropriate time integration algorithm .",
    "the resulting semi - discrete system constitutes a large system of ode s which can be numerically solved by using a time integrator that satisfies an energy estimate  @xcite .",
    "[ [ consider - adding - explicit - dissipation ] ] consider adding explicit dissipation    it is well known that finite difference approximations do not adequately represent the highest frequency modes on a given grid , corresponding to the shortest possible wavelengths that can be represented on the grid . if the smallest spacing between points is @xmath16 , the shortest wavelength is @xmath17 with the corresponding frequency @xmath18 .",
    "these modes can , and often do , travel in the wrong direction .",
    "for this reason , it is sometimes useful to add explicit numerical dissipation to rid the simulation of these modes in a way that is consistent with the continuum equation at hand .",
    "as finer grids are used , the effect of this dissipation becomes smaller and acts only on increasingly higher frequencies .",
    "the dissipation operators are constructed such that discrete energy estimates , obtained using sbp , are not spoiled .",
    "explicit expressions for such dissipation operators are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to summarize , beginning with a well - posed initial - boundary value problem , we mimic the derivation of continuum energy estimates for the discrete problem using ( 1 ) spatial derivative operators satisfying summation by parts , ( 2 ) orthogonal projections to represent boundary conditions and ( 3 ) choosing an appropriate time integrator .      as discussed above , a numerical implementation of any system of partial differential equations",
    "necessarily involves boundaries .",
    "unless periodic boundary conditions can be imposed , as is often the case for the evolution on compact domains without boundaries , one deals with an initial - boundary value problem , and thus has to face the question of how to specify boundary conditions . in theories that give rise to constraints , like general relativity , such conditions must be chosen carefully to ensure that the constraints propagate .    as a very simple illustration ,",
    "consider the 1d wave equation @xmath19 on the half line @xmath20 .",
    "let us reduce it to first order form by introducing the variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 a negative constant : @xmath24 at the boundary @xmath25 , the system has two ingoing fields , given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and one outgoing field .",
    "however , the ingoing fields can not be given independently , as we see next .",
    "the constraint @xmath28 propagates as @xmath29 and so @xmath30 is an ingoing field with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we have to impose the boundary condition @xmath31 which implies the condition @xmath32 on the main variables .",
    "we can replace this with a condition that is intrinsic to the boundary by using the evolution equation ( [ eq : ut2 ] ) in order to eliminate the @xmath33-derivative and obtain @xmath34 this equation provides an evolution equation for determining @xmath26 at the boundary , which guarantees that the constraint @xmath31 is preserved throughout evolution .",
    "it can be complemented by the sommerfeld condition @xmath35 .",
    "this simple example gives just a glimpse of the different issues involved in prescribing constraint - preserving boundary conditions .",
    "the case of einsteins s field equations is more complicated ; we refer the interested reader to refs .",
    "@xcite . a major difficulty is the fact that , in general , constraint - preserving boundary conditions do not have the form of maximal dissipative boundary conditions , and for this reason it has proven to be difficult to find well posed initial - boundary value formulations of einstein s equations that preserve the constraints .",
    "formulations of the einstein equations are often cast in symmetric hyperbolic form by adding constraints to the evolution equations multiplied by parameters or spacetime functions .",
    "the symmetric hyperbolicity condition partially restricts these parameters , however , considerable freedom in the formulation exists in choosing these free parameters ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "analytically , when data are on the constraint surface , all allowed values for these parameters are equally valid . off of the constraint surface , however , different values of these parameters may be regarded as representing `` different '' theories .",
    "it is no surprise then that numerical simulations are sensitive to the values chosen for these parameters , as numerical data rarely are on the constraint surface .",
    "unfortunately , the parameters in current simulations are proving to be extremely sensitive .",
    "relatively mall variations in these parameters ( within the allowed range for a symmetric hyperbolic formulation ) produce run times in simulations that vary over several orders of magnitude , as measured by an asymptotic observer .    furthermore , the parameters are not unique",
    ". values convenient for one physical problem might be inappropriate in another . recently , a method to dynamically choose these parameters  promoted to functions of time  was introduced that naturally adapts to the physical problem under study  @xcite .",
    "basically , one exploits the freedom in choosing these functions to control the growth rate of an energy norm for constraint violations .",
    "since this norm is exactly zero analytically , this provides a guide to choosing the parameters that will drive the solution to one that satisfies the constraints .",
    "this method provides a _ practical _ solution to this problem of choosing parameters , although it may not be the most elegant solution .",
    "ideally , one would like to understand how the growth rate of the solution depends on the these parameter values in order to choose them appropriately .",
    "this would require sharp growth estimates , however , which are still unavailable . while further understanding is gained in this front",
    ", this practical remedy can be of much help in present simulations .",
    "we summarize here the essential ideas of this method .",
    "consider a system of hyperbolic equations with constraint terms , @xmath36 , written schematically as @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath36 are vector valued functions , and @xmath40 is a matrix ( generally not square ) that is a function of the spacetime ( @xmath36 represents a vector function of general constraint variables ) .",

    "the grid indices @xmath42 are suppressed to simplify the notation .",

    "@xmath49 is the discrete derivative approximation to @xmath50 .",

    "similarly , the subscript in @xmath51 indicates that the quantity is related to @xmath52 through eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath53 any violation of the constraints will decay exponentially @xmath54 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one good option among many others seems to be choosing a tolerance value , @xmath55 , for the norm of the constraints that is close to the initial discrete value , and solving for @xmath40 such that the constraints decay to this tolerance value after a given relaxation time .",
    "this can be done by adopting an @xmath52 such that after some time @xmath56 the constraints have the value @xmath55 .",
    "replacing @xmath57 by @xmath55 in equation ( [ decay ] ) and solving for @xmath52 gives @xmath58 if one then solves @xmath59 for @xmath60 , with @xmath52 given by eq .",

( [ eq_for_mu ] ) serves as a guide to formulate a practical method to choose free parameters in the equations with which the numerical solution behaves well with respect to the satisfaction of the constraints . naturally , if one deals , as it is often the case , with more than one free parameter , eq .",
    "( [ eq_for_mu ] ) must be augmented with other conditions to yield a unique solution .",
    "this extra freedom is actually very useful in preventing large time - variations in the parameters that are sometimes needed in order to keep the constraints under control .",
    "these large variations do not represent a fundamental problem but a practical one , due to the small time stepping that they require in order to keep errors due to time integration reasonably small .",
    "one way to prevent this is by using this extra freedom to pick up the point in parameter space that not only gives the desired constraint growth , but also minimizes the change of parameters between two consecutive timesteps .    rather than including the full details on the particular way we have implemented the method , we describe here a simple example to illustrate its application .",
    "assume , for instance , that within a particular formulation only two free functions , @xmath62 , are employed , eq .",
    "( [ eq_for_mu ] ) formally evaluates to @xmath63 now , we exploit the freedom in the free functions to adjust the rate of change of the energy @xmath64 if the values of @xmath65 are known . in practice , these are easily obtained during evolution . once these are known , eq .",
    "( [ eq_for_mu_ex ] ) , coupled to the requirement that @xmath62 vary as little as possible from one evaluation to another , results in a straightforward strategy to evaluate preferred values of the free parameters .",
    "this is done at a single resolution `` test '' run and , through interpolation in time , continuum , _ a priori _ defined parameters which keep the constraints under control for the given problem are obtained .",
    "depending on the formulation of the equations , the free parameters might have to satisfy some conditions in order for symmetric hyperbolicity to hold , which can restrict the range of values these parameters can take .",
    "nevertheless , even within a restricted window , the technique allows one to adopt the most convenient values these parameters should have for the problem at hand .",
    "we now present applications of the techniques previously discussed .",
    "the goal is to illustrate how well - resolved simulations can indeed serve as a powerful tool to understand particular problems . to this end",
    "we have chosen a problem found in higher dimensional general relativity .",
    "a second application is that of the simulation of single black hole spacetimes , where the issue of the _ a priori _ lack of a preferred formulation is illustrated .      as a first application we concentrate on the study of _ bubble spacetimes _ and elucidate the dynamical behavior of configurations with both positive and negative masses and their possible connection to naked singularities .",
    "bubble spacetimes have been studied extensively within five - dimensional kaluza - klein theory .",
    "these are five - dimensional spacetimes in which the circumference of the `` extra '' dimensions shrinks to zero on some compact surface referred to as the `` bubble '' .",
    "these bubbles were initially studied by their relevance in the quantum instability of flat spacetime @xcite , as bubbles can be obtained via semi - classical tunneling from it .",
    "they were later extended to include data corresponding to negative energy configurations ( at a moment of time symmetry )  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , among the reasons for considering negative energy solutions is that naked singularities are associated with them .",
    "therefore , these solutions are attractive tests of the cosmic censorship conjecture . additionally , bubble spacetimes can also be obtained by double - wick rotation of black strings , whose stability properties ( or lack thereof ) have been the subject of intense scrutiny in recent years .",
    "these features make bubble spacetimes both interesting an relevant for gravity beyond four - dimensions , and thus attention has been devoted to fully understand their behavior .",
    "as we will see , even when the `` analytical '' study of the problem is greatly simplified by symmetry assumptions , many lingering questions remain and numerical simulations provided a viable way to shed light into them .",
    "furthermore , these simulations were also key to ` digging out ' a few unexpected features of the solution .    in order to obtain a complete description of the dynamical behavior of these spacetimes , a numerical code , implementing einstein equations in 5d settings , and capable of handling the possibly strong curvature associated",
    "need be constructed .",
    "fortunately , the assumption of a @xmath66 symmetry simplifies the treatment of the problem , which can be reduced to a @xmath67 manifold .",
    "this , in turn , renders the problem quite tractable by the currently available computational resources , though as we will see , considerable care must be placed at both analytical and numerical levels for an accurate treatment of the problem .",
    "we consider a generalization of the time symmetric family of initial data presented in  @xcite .",
    "we start with a spacetime endowed with the metric @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the standard metric on the unit two - sphere @xmath70 and @xmath71 is a smooth function that has a regular root at some @xmath72 , is everywhere positive for @xmath73 and converges to one as @xmath74 . the coordinate @xmath75 parameterizes the extra dimension @xmath76 which has the period @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting spacetime @xmath78 constitutes a regular manifold with the topology @xmath79 .",
    "the bubble is located where the circumference of the extra dimension shrinks to zero , that is , at @xmath80 .    additionally , we consider the presence of an electromagnetic field of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a smooth function of @xmath83 that converges to zero as @xmath74 .",
    "the symmetries of the problem would also allow for a non - trivial electric component of the field .",
    "however , it is not difficult to show that maxwell s equations imply that such a field necessarily diverges at the location of the bubble . for this reason , in the following , we only consider the case of vanishing electric field .    in this article , we consider initial data with @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath86 an integer greater than one .",
    "this field generalizes the ansatz considered in  @xcite , where only the case @xmath87 was discussed , and allows for different interesting initial configurations . in the time - symmetric case ,",
    "initial data satisfying the hamiltonian constraint obeys @xmath88 with @xmath89 and free integration constants @xmath90 and @xmath23 . here , the parameter @xmath90 is related to the adm mass via @xmath91 .",

    "@xcite , this implies that negative mass bubbles start out expanding ( the initial velocity of the area is zero since we only consider time - symmetric initial data ) , while for large enough positive mass the bubble starts out collapsing . in the vacuum case",
    ", our numerical simulations suggest that initially collapsing bubbles undergo complete collapse and form a black string . in the non - vacuum case",
    "however , the strength of the electromagnetic field can modify this behavior completely .",
    "we will see that for small enough @xmath85 the bubble continues to collapse whereas when @xmath85 is large the bubble area bounces back and expands .",
    "interesting behavior is obtained at the critical value for @xmath85 which divides the phase space between collapsing and expanding solutions .    for @xmath99",
    "it is possible to obtain initial configurations with negative mass and negative initial acceleration  @xcite",
    ". this can potentially give rise to a collapsing bubble of negative energy , and thus to a naked singularity .",

    ", it is convenient to introduce a new radial coordinate @xmath101 which facilitates the specification of regularity conditions at the bubble location .",
