    "quests for fundamental correlations in strongly interacting systems can be a clue to understanding the structure of the physical systems .",
    "for instance , the cooper pair , which is a correlated electron pair , is a key concept to understand many - electron systems and leads to superconductivity after it condenses with other pairs .",
    "also in nuclear physics , two - nucleon pair correlation can be an important degree of freedom to describe the nucleus , such as in the interacting boson model . in hadron physics , two - quark pair correlations , or diquarks , were introduced in the early days of quark model to explain systematics in baryon spectroscopy@xcite . over the years , experimental findings in the structure function , fragmentation function and weak decay processes pointed to the existence of a strong diquark correlation , especially in a definite spin - flavor configuration , which is the so - called good diquark channel  @xcite .    in two - color qcd with massless quarks ,",
    "interquark interactions have exactly the same strength as @xmath8-@xmath9 correlations due to the pauli - grsey symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is explicitly broken in three - color qcd , but the remnant is seen in the good diquark channel , which has a resemblance but less strong attraction to its counterpart of @xmath10 . the strong diquark correlation in the good channel can be derived from one gluon exchange potential or through the instanton - induced interaction , and is found in the lattice calculation in the landau gauge  @xcite and coulomb gauge  @xcite .",
    "it is also found in the configuration with an additional color source to make the whole configuration gauge invariant  @xcite .",
    "however , in most hadron configurations the strong diquark correlation expressible as an elementary constituent has not been so evident .",
    "the reason why diquarks can not be treated as an elementary constituent can be traced back to the original work by jaffe on the tetraquark picture for the scalar nonet  @xcite . there",
    ", the wave function for @xmath11 is found to be dominantly composed of the @xmath12-@xmath12 state in the meson - meson basis , which translates into a small diquark - antidiquark component in their respective good channels .",
    "this means that when an antiquark is present , the diquark would break and form a quark - antiquark pair , which is energetically more favorable than a diquark .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the reason we have quark condensate over diquark - antidiquark condensate in the qcd vacuum .",
    "nonetheless , there are certain configurations where the good diquark correlation is the strongest and its role is important .",
    "the color superconducting phase appearing at high density is an example  @xcite .",
    "there the strong correlation in the good diquark channel is responsible for the cooper pairing . at the hadron level ,",
    "the simplest configuration of this sort is the baryon composed of a diquark @xmath13 and a spectator quark ( @xmath14 ) ; namely @xmath15 , where @xmath14 can be @xmath16 or @xmath17 quarks .",
    "the reason that a diquark correlation remains strong can be understood from the color - spin interaction , which is known to be inversely proportional to the constituent mass of the quarks . inside the @xmath2 ,",
    "the color - spin interaction between @xmath18 quarks cancels that between @xmath19 quarks when the diquark ( @xmath20 ) is in the i=0 channel .",
    "moreover , the color - spin interactions with the heavy quark itself become smaller as @xmath14 becomes heavy @xcite .",
    "hence the diquark will retain its strong correlation with small @xmath21 or @xmath22 correlations .",
    "other configurations , where diquark correlations are expected to remain important are hadrons with large angular momentum  @xcite and exotic configurations with heavy quarks  @xcite .    in this paper , we will show that , inside the @xmath15 , diquark correlation is indeed strong so that the diquark can be treated as an elementary constituent .",
    "we further show that one can extract well - defined parameters for the _ diquark _ , from which one can also define the constituent diquark mass .",
    "to carry out our task , we propose a framework for describing the @xmath15 based on the qcd sum rule technique  @xcite . in the usual study of baryon spectra in the qcd sum rule ,",
    "one calculates a correlation function of baryonic currents composed of the quark fields using the operator product expansion  @xcite .",
    "if the correlation of a pair of quarks is strong , the pair can be regarded effectively as elementary degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , we introduce an explicit scalar - diquark field @xmath23 with the color charge @xmath24 in @xmath25 and calculate the correlation function of the @xmath26 current given by @xmath27 with @xmath14 being the heavy quark field : @xmath28 \\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\hat q",

    "the dynamics of the diquark field obeys the color su(3 ) gauge theory : @xmath30 \\phi ,   \\label{eq : diqqcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the covariant derivative for the diquark is given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the diquark mass .",
    "we incorporate eq .",
    "( [ eq : diqqcd ] ) into the qcd lagrangian .",
    "as we emphasized before , we will be using this lagrangian only in configurations where the diquark correlations remain strong .",
    "one should note that the high energy limit of the correlation in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) does not have a corresponding high - energy limit in real qcd , as the diquark field is treated here as an elementary field , which is not the case in reality .",
    "nevertheless , one can use this framework to check the validity of the description of @xmath15 by confirming that the current @xmath33 couples strongly to the physical @xmath15 at low energy and that the correlation function reproduces the correct mass of @xmath15 .",
    "the operator product expansion ( ope ) makes it possible to write down the correlation function in terms of vacuum expectation values of the elementary fields stemming from nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "the ope of both the even and odd part of the correlation function ( [ def ] ) can be calculated using the fixed - point gauge .",
    "we include the diquark condensate @xmath34 and perform the calculation to leading order in @xmath35 up to terms of condensates having dimension 6 .",
    "note that since the diquark field has dimension 1 in the @xmath26 current @xmath36 , the correlation function ( [ def ] ) has mass dimension 1 , which is smaller than the usual baryonic correlators .",
    "the perturbative part is as follows :    [ eq : pert ] @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth noting that , although we call eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert ] ) the perturbative part that is obtained by the perturbative calculation of our effective model , since we introduce the diquark as an elementary field , these terms contain highly non - perturbative interactions in the sense of original qcd .",

    "our theory will only comprise a limited phase space of the whole qcd .",
    "however , once we introduce the diquark field as an effective degree of freedom , the spectral density at high energy can be calculated perturbatively as asymptotic freedom remains valid also in scalar qcd .    in principle , the sum rules for the @xmath26 mass can be obtained by the following : @xmath63 \\over { \\bf b.t . }",

    "the fact that good borel stability has been obtained implies that the correlation function of @xmath33 with the diquark field strongly couples to the low - lying @xmath2 baryon and thus the description of @xmath2 in terms of the diquark degrees of freedom works well .",
    "the borel window in this case is set between @xmath88 and @xmath89 gev@xmath90 .",
    "the lower limit is determined by the ope convergence where the contribution of the condensate part is less than 30% of the perturbative part , while the upper limit is determined by the pole dominance in which the @xmath2 pole contribution exceeds the contributions coming from the second term of eq .",

    "next we discuss diquark parameter dependence of the sum rule stability .",
    "when @xmath83 becomes smaller than @xmath91 for @xmath92 gev , the borel stability is lost and the mass monotonically decreases toward smaller borel mass . for larger @xmath83",
    "the curve breaks down at lower borel mass .",
    "similar behavior is found for a larger diquark mass of 0.3 gev , as seen in the right figure . on the other hand , this time , the stable curve is obtained when the diqurk condensate is smaller @xmath93 .",
    "one can further analyze the sum rule for different values of the diquark mass and diquark condensate and find a strong correlation between the two parameters .",
    "that is to say , to reproduce the physical @xmath2 mass with a stable borel curve , for larger ( smaller ) diquark mass , we need smaller ( larger ) diquark condensate . in general , obtaining a stable curve should have enough information to determine a unique pair of the parameters , since it is not trivial at all that the sum rule works well with the borel stability .",
    "nevertheless , in the present case , we find a duality - type relation among the two parameters .",
    "this means that the @xmath2 mass may be essentially controlled by a single physical quantity , such as a  constituent \" diquark mass . in the limit when the diquark condensate is zero ( @xmath94 ) , one finds that the necessary diquark mass is around 0.4 gev , which corresponds to the constituent diquark mass .",
    "finally , we show the sum rule with @xmath95 but with different @xmath78 . as can be seen in the right figure of fig .",

    "unfortunately , the threshold parameter that gives the most stable borel curve slightly underestimates the mass of @xmath71 .",
    "we believe that the large difference in the bottom quark mass requires the use of different renormalization points for the vacuum expectation values , which can be a topic of future study .     for @xmath3 ( left ) and @xmath4 ( right ) with the solid lines showing the case with the chosen thresholds .",

    "this is a simplification , but since we are interested only in the structure of the physical @xmath2 , all we need is that the approximation be valid for the physical @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as has been shown through our qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "on the other hand , when we are analyzing states that have another light quark or an antiquark , the diquark description is expected to fail .",
    "for example , in the proton , the @xmath20 diquark , despite its strong correlation , will tunnel into a new @xmath100 diquark with the spectator @xmath101 quark . in our language",
    ", we would need an effective @xmath102 coupling to include this process .",
    "the actual application of our sum rule to the nucleon case obtained by taking @xmath103 to zero gives a nucleon mass above 1 gev without a stable borel curve . in that sense the minimal lagrangian for the diquark given in eq .",

    "we have also analyzed the sum rule with a @xmath104 current . in the scalar nonet picture ,",
    "the @xmath11 meson is composed of four quarks , but will have a strong quark - antiquark component .",

    "indeed , we find that the sum rule obtained does not reproduce the @xmath11 mass around 400 to 600 mev . instead we find a monotonically decreasing borel curve where the mass ranges from 1400 to 1000 gev .",
    "the explicit treatment of four quark fields in the qcd sum rule has reproduced a lower mass with a stable curve  @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", we have introduced an explicit diquark degree of freedom and analyzed the sum rule for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we find that we can reproduce the masses of these states well , suggesting that these states can be represented by a strong diquark and a spectator quark .",
    "we further find that there is a duality between diquark condensate and diquark mass from which we can estimate the constituent diquark mass to be around 400 mev .",
    "we expect that such an explicit diquark degree of freedom can be an effective method to describe configurations where diquark correlation is expected to remain strong .",
