    "the adsorption of colloidal particles onto a surface is a subject of considerable interest due to its many practical applications in fields as diverse as physics , chemistry , biophysics , medicine , etc . @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed so far , in an attempt to understand the physical properties of the adsorbed phase . in the random sequential adsorption ( rsa )",
    "model @xcite , the adsorbing particles are located at random positions on the surface . if an incoming particle overlaps with a previously adsorbed one , it is rejected ; otherwise , it becomes irreversibly adsorbed .",
    "the rsa model does not consider the transport of the particles , and focuses only on the excluded volume effects .",
    "it is thus a valid approximation when the particles arrive at the surface purely by diffusion @xcite . in the ballistic model ( bm )",
    "@xcite , when an incoming particle fails to reach the surface directly , it is allowed to roll down over the previously adsorbed ones , following the direction of the steepest descent , until it reaches an equilibrium position .",
    "particles that eventually rest on the surface are irreversibly adsorbed ; otherwise , they are rejected .",
    "the bm is therefore a good approximation to describe adsorption in presence of strong interactions , attracting the particles towards the surface @xcite .    in their original formulation ,",
    "the aforementioned models , as well as their main variations , consider essentially the adsorption of a _ monodisperse _ suspension , in which the adsorbing particles have all the same size .",
    "real - life suspensions , however , always possess an unavoidable degree of polydispersity .",
    "for instance , in some experimental situations the standard deviation of the particle size distribution may be up to 510@xmath1 of the mean particle size @xcite .",
    "under such conditions , the effects of polydispersity may be indeed important .",
    "the role of polydispersity has been studied in some detail in the rsa model .",
    "theoretical works have dealt with binary mixtures of particles with greatly differing diameters @xcite , power - law size distributions @xcite , or general continuous size distributions @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations , on the other hand , have been performed in a wider variety of conditions : binary mixtures @xcite , uniform size distributions @xcite , gaussian distributions @xcite , power - law distributions @xcite , etc .    in the context of the bm , it is noteworthy the work of senger _",
    "@xcite , where the authors describe a monte carlo model for the adsorption of a two - component mixture of hard spheres onto a plane , where the particles are under the simultaneous influence of diffusion and gravity .",
    "this is indeed a mixed model , which reproduces the standard rsa model in the limit of small particles , and the bm for large particles .",
    "the results reported by senger",
    "_ et al . _",
    ", for particles large enough to be well inside the bm regime , are qualitatively similar to those found for the rsa of binary mixtures @xcite : the maximum fraction of surface covered by the adsorbed particles  the _ jamming limit _ @xmath2increases monotonically with the concentration @xmath3 of large particles , with a maximum in the limit @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath5 arbitrarily small , but non - zero ) . for @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "the coverage corresponding to monodisperse adsorption is recovered .",
    "in this paper we present an analytic model for the ballistic adsorption of mixtures of spherical particles with different diameters . the model can be solved in a mean field approximation , by studying the kinetics of the gap density function @xcite . within this approach",
    ", we are able to derive a generic equation for an effective gap distribution . to test our equation , we solve it explicitly in the simplest case of a binary mixture .",
    "the analytic results obtained for the density at jamming @xmath2 match the findings of direct monte carlo simulations of the model . moreover , the qualitative behavior of @xmath2 predicted by our model is the same as the reported by senger _",
    "our model considers the adsorption onto a line of a polydisperse mixture whose degree of polydispersity is characterized , in general , by a continuous distribution of sizes @xmath8 .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is defined as the fraction ( bulk concentration in the infinite reservoir from which the particles are drawn ) of spheres with diameter between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we assume @xmath12 to be normalized to 1 .",
    "thus , for a monocomponent solution of particles of size @xmath13 , we have @xmath14 .",
    "the particles arrive at the line at rates @xmath15 per unit length per unit time . assuming that the adsorbed substrate interacts with the incoming particles only through excluded volume effects",
    ", we can select the appropriate units of time and set @xmath16 . under these conditions",
    ", the problem translates into the sequential adsorption of particles of size @xmath10 , selected with a probability density @xmath8 .",
    "[ configurations ]    when an incoming particle lands over a preadsorbed one of exactly the same size , the adsorption rules are identical to the standard bm @xcite .",
    "figure  [ configurations ] depicts the possible configurations involving particles of different diameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "when a small particle rolls over a large one , the former finally falls on the surface and , after it is adsorbed , the centers of both particles are separated a horizontal distance @xmath20 ; fig .",
    "[ configurations](a ) represents this case .",
    "when a large particle rolls over a small one , the rule adopted in our model is the one represented in fig .",
    "[ configurations](b ) , in which , after rolling , the centers of the two particles are also separated a distance @xmath21 .    the adoption of the rule pictured in fig .",
    "[ configurations](b ) represents a major simplification in the model . it could be possible to argue that , in a more realistic treatment , the final configuration involving a large particle rolling over a small one should be the one depicted in fig .  [ configurations](c ) .",
    "the surfaces of the particles are tangent after adsorption in this case , and their centers are separated a horizontal distance @xmath22 .",
    "both rules can be easily implemented in a numerical simulation .",
    "however , the prescription [ configurations](c ) imposes an essential asymmetry among particles of different size .",
    "first of all , in our model , as defined by rules [ configurations](a ) and [ configurations](b ) , the final result of an adsorption event involving two spheres of different diameter is independent of the order in which the particles reach the surface . as a consequence ,",
    "our model does not allow for `` overhangs '' ; this means that , if @xmath23 is the density of adsorbed particles of size @xmath10 , then the fraction of covered surface @xmath24 is simply given by @xmath25 .",
    "this simple expression obviously does not hold in a model defined with the rule [ configurations](c ) .",
    "these `` abelian '' properties are eventually responsible for our model being analytically tractable .",
    "the model defined in the previous section can be analyzed by studying the density function of gaps  holes between two consecutive adsorbed particles .",
    "let us define @xmath26 as the number of gaps with a length between @xmath27 and @xmath28 present at time @xmath29 , per unit length of substrate .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath30 is obtained as a balance equation for the creation and destruction of gaps caused by a single adsorption event @xcite .",
    "given @xmath30 , the fraction of covered surface is defined by @xmath31 and , from here , we obtain the jamming limit as @xmath32 .",
    "in the case of the ballistic adsorption of a monodisperse solution of spheres of diameter @xmath13 , the equations for the density of gaps are @xcite    @xmath33    the solution of ( [ eq : single1])([eq : single2 ] ) is @xmath34    2 where we have defined the auxiliary function @xmath35 for a polydisperse mixture , the naive application of this approach becomes considerably more involved . after a moment s reflection , it is easy to realize that , in this case , the final configuration resulting from an adsorption event taking place on a given gap , depends on the sizes of the particles defining the boundaries of that gap . we should accordingly deal with a continuous set of functions @xmath36 , defined as the densities of gaps created between particles of size @xmath37 and @xmath38 , for @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "an enumeration of all the possible events occurring when adsorbing spheres of size @xmath10 at rate @xmath8 , would lead to a system of exact coupled integro - differential equations for the magnitudes @xmath40 , that would completely determine the dynamics of the process .",
    "the magnitude of this task , especially when dealing with continuous size distributions @xmath8 , seems to preclude any chance for an exact solution .",
    "fortunately , however , a great deal of insight can be gained by seeking for a _ mean - field _ type of solution , based in the following argument : when the particles are free in the suspension , they are _ distinguishable _ and interact differently with the adsorbed phase , depending on their size . however , once they have been adsorbed , we can assume that they become _ indistinguishable _ , in the sense that the adsorbed particles interact with the incoming particles as if the former were all _ equal _ , with the same average diameter @xmath41 .",
    "in other words , we can approximate the adsorbed phase as composed by _ effective _ particles of the same size @xmath42 , interacting with incoming particles of size @xmath10 . assuming this simplification , we need only a single _ effective gap distribution _",
    "@xmath30 , defined by the gaps bounded by the adsorbed effective particles .",
    "we remark the important fact that the aforementioned mean - field approximation _ does not _ imply at all that the density of adsorbed particles is proportional to the bulk density , @xmath43 .",
    "this relation , which can be true at the first stages of the adsorption process , does not hold close to the jammed  saturated  state .",
    "this last statement is most easily seen in binary mixtures ( see sec .  [ binary ] ) .",
    "the kinetic equation for the effective gap density can be written in the generic form    @xmath44    2    the origin of the different terms in ( [ eq : generic ] ) is the following : the destruction of gaps of length @xmath27 is due to the landing of a particle of size @xmath10 on any point of an interval of length @xmath45 centered on the gap .",
    "after averaging over the distribution of incoming particles of size @xmath46 , we obtain the first term in ( [ eq : generic ] ) .",
    "a gap of length @xmath27 can be created by the impact of particles of size @xmath10 on either of the particles of effective size @xmath42 defining a gap of length @xmath47 .",
    "these events , which happen at rate @xmath8 , account for the second term in ( [ eq : generic ] ) .",
    "the last term is due to the averaged creation of gaps of length @xmath27 by direct deposition of a particle of size @xmath10 onto a gap of length @xmath48 .",
    "we remark again that eq .",
    "( [ eq : generic ] ) owes its relatively simple form to the choice of the `` abelian '' rule [ configurations](b ) in the definition of the model .",
    "a much more complex expression would have been obtained with rule [ configurations](c ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : generic ] ) can be expressed in a more compact way by integrating by parts its last term .",
    "defining the distribution function @xmath49 , we obtain @xmath50 { g(x+{\\sigma } , t)}.    \\label{eq : compact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eq : compact ] ) is the final expression of the mean - field theory for our model of polysdisperse ballistic adsorption . as a consistency check",
    ", we consider the trivial scenario of a monodisperse suspension . in this case , by setting @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the heaviside step function , we immediately recover the equations for a single - size distribution , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : single1 ] ) and ( [ eq : single2 ] ) .",
    "in order to test the validity of our mean - field theory , we proceed now to solve explicitly eq .",
    "( [ eq : compact ] ) in the case of a binary mixture , composed by particles of size @xmath54 , which adsorb onto the surface at rate @xmath55 , and particles of size @xmath56 , adsorbing at rate @xmath57 . as an aside , in this simple setting we can estimate the variations in the jamming limit due to the adoption of rule [ configurations](b ) instead of [ configurations](c ) .",
    "one can expect that , for small values of @xmath58 , the outcome of both models should be similar .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations show that , for values of @xmath59 , the difference between prescriptions is always less than @xmath60 , for all values of @xmath61 .",
    "the density function for a binary mixture has the form @xmath62 , whereas the distribution function is @xmath63 , and the average size @xmath64 . by inserting these expressions into ( [ eq : generic ] ) or ( [ eq : compact ] )",
    ", we obtain the following set of equations :    @xmath65    we observe that , for a binary mixture , one could in principle try to solve _ exactly _ the model , by determining the rate equations for the densities of gaps delimited by particles of size @xmath66 and @xmath58 , namely @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "however , in this case one would end up with a set of nine coupled equations .",
    "the simplification achieved through the mean - field theory is here evident .",
    "we consider in particular the case @xmath70 . to solve the kinetic equations , we seek in ( [ eq : large ] ) a solution of the form @xmath71 . with this substitution ,",
    "we are led to the equation for @xmath72 : @xmath73 e^{-t } + \\phi_r \\left [ ( r+\\bar{{\\sigma } } )   +       \\frac{2}{t } \\right ] e^{-rt } .",

    ", we look for a solution of this equation of the form @xmath77 .",
    "the equation determining @xmath78 is @xmath79 from which @xmath80 is obtained by direct integration , together with the initial condition @xmath81 : @xmath82 finally , by substituting the solutions of ( [ eq : large ] ) and ( [ eq : intermediate ] ) into the appropriate range of values of @xmath27 in eq .",
