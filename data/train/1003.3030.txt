    "the ecology of galaxies is dominated by supernova ( sn ) explosions , which inject energy and enriched material into the interstellar medium and trigger the formation of the next generations of stars .",
    "many fundamental aspects of sne are still poorly understood , both for the core - collapse ( cc ) sn explosions that are thought to end the lives of massive ( @xmath4 ) stars and for the type - ia sne ( sne  ia ) that are believed to be the thermonuclear combustions of co white dwarfs ( wds ) that approach the chandrasekhar mass . nevertheless , the two flavors of sne deposit a similar amount ( @xmath5 erg ) of kinetic energy into the surrounding medium , leaving behind supernova remnants ( snrs ) that remain visible for thousands of years .",
    "in recent times , the study of young snrs at x - ray wavelengths has emerged as a new way to explore the physics of cc and type ia sn explosions ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but most known snrs are too old to provide much information about the specific events that originated them ( see discussions in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in spite of this , much can be learned by studying the entire population of snrs , young and old , in nearby galaxies . because the timescales for snr evolution are short compared to most of the processes that affect the structure of galaxies , snr catalogues",
    "provide a clean record of the environments where sne explode , which can be used to put constraints on the properties of their progenitors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , by considering the properties of the entire population of snrs in a galaxy together with the bulk properties of the gas they are expanding into , we can gain insights into the evolutionary phases of snrs @xcite , the structure of galaxies on scales comparable to the average snr size @xcite , and the cycles of matter and energy in the interstellar medium @xcite .    in this paper and in a companion publication ( maoz & badenes 2010 , henceforth paper  ii ) , we use the snr population in the magellanic clouds to explore some of these issues . the magellanic clouds ( mcs )",
    "have the advantage of being close enough to study key aspects of their global structure in great detail , and they also harbor a large and extensively observed population of snrs .",
    "thus , they are the optimal setting to study the interplay between local density , star formation , sn explosions , and snr evolution on a galactic scale . our ultimate goal , and the focus of paper  ii , is to derive the sn rate and delay time distribution ( i.e. , the sn rate as a function of time following a brief burst of star formation ) in the magellanic clouds .",
    "however , this can not be done without understanding first the relationship between the lifetime of snrs and the properties of their local environments .",
    "this is the subject of the present work .",
    "the evolution of snrs has been the subject of many theoretical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because accurate ages are only known for a handful of young , often historical objects , any observational tests of these theoretical models must rely on snr size as a proxy for age .",
    "given that snrs of equal ages will have different sizes if they expand in different media , this necessarily brings the role of local density into the picture .",
    "previous works on the distribution of snr sizes initially focused on the milky way and the mcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but more recent efforts have also explored other galaxies in the local group , including m31 @xcite , m33 @xcite , and m83 @xcite . with few exceptions ,",
    "these studies gave little consideration to the bulk properties of the gas in the galaxies hosting the snrs .",
    "in many cases , their samples were also affected by issues of completeness and biases from working at a single wavelength .",
    "not surprisingly , these efforts have failed to produce a unified , physically motivated picture of the evolution of snrs in the interstellar medium . here",
    ", we propose a first approximation to the problem in the context of the magellanic clouds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ catalog ] , we present a compilation of multi - wavelength observations for the 77 known snrs in the magellanic clouds , and we argue that it provides a fairly complete record of all the sne that have exploded over the last @xmath0  kyr . in   [ distribution ] , we examine the size distribution of snrs in both galaxies , and we find that the cumulative distribution is close to linear ( i.e. , the differential is close to uniform ) , within the uncertainties associated with the relatively small number of objects , up to a marked cutoff at a physical radius of @xmath6 30 pc .",
    "we also show that the snr size distribution in m33 has very similar properties , suggesting that these features might be widespread . in ",
    "[ physics ] , we propose a physical model to explain this distribution , based on the assumption that most objects are in the sedov ( adiabatic ) stage of their evolution , and that they rapidly fade away once they transition to the radiative stage , at an age that depends on the local density . under these conditions ,",
    "the uniform distribution of snr sizes requires that the gas density in the clouds have a probability distribution described by a power law with an index of @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) . in ",
    "[ densityestimates ] , we test this requirement by examining the distribution of three independent density tracers in the clouds : neutral hydrogen column density , h@xmath3 surface brightness , and star - formation rate based on resolved stellar populations .",
    "we find that these tracers are indeed well described by powerlaws with a @xmath71 index .",
    "this lends credence to our model , and provides us with the crucial means to estimate the visibility time of snrs in different locations , which we review briefly in   [ sec : disc ] , and more extensively in paper  ii , where we use it to derive the sn rate and delay time distribution in the clouds .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our main results and outlining avenues for future work in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the population of snrs in the mcs has been the object of extensive study for many decades .",
    "several catalogues have been compiled at different wavelengths , from the radio to the optical and x - ray . because snrs in the milky way and the mcs are usually discovered in the radio , it is the radio catalogues that often have the largest number of entries , but there is some confusion in the literature regarding the total number of snrs in the clouds .",
    "@xcite listed all the discrete radio sources in the parkes survey of the mcs , and found 32 snrs and 12 snr candidates in the lmc , and 12 snrs in the smc . according to @xcite , a revision of the parkes survey complemented with australian telecope compact array ( atca ) data yields 52 confirmed snrs and 20 candidates in the lmc , but these sources are not listed in their paper .",
    "instead , the authors present optical spectroscopy of 25 of the 52 confirmed lmc snrs .",
    "data from atca was also collected for the smc , where @xcite list 16 confirmed snrs . an optical catalogue of mc snrs is being assembled as part of the magellanic clouds emission line survey ( mcels , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the most recent on - line version of this catalogue lists 31 snrs in the lmc and 11 in the smc . in the x - rays",
    ", @xcite published an atlas of _ rosat _ sources , which contained 31 lmc snrs .",
    "the most recent on - line version of this catalogue , complemented with optical , radio and infrared data , lists 38 confirmed snrs in the lmc . finally , @xcite present _ xmm - newton_observations of 13 smc snrs .    taken separately ,",
    "these catalogues are not adequate for our purposes , because they disagree on the classification of particular sources , and assign different names , sizes and positions to well - known objects .",
    "catalogues at different wavelengths can also be sensitive to snrs at different stages of their evolution , so a multi - wavelength compilation is the best way to obtain a global picture of the snr population . at the writing of this paper ,",
    "there is still no unified , multi - wavelength catalogue of all the snrs in the mcs in the refereed literature , although the magellanic clouds supernova remnants ( mcsnr ) collaboration is assembling one @xcite .",
    "the current version of the mcsnr catalogue contains 48 confirmed objects in the lmc and 19 in the smc .",
    "we have merged this on - line catalogue with the ones listed in the previous paragraph , taking only the sources that are classified as confirmed snrs in at least one catalogue , and eliminating all duplicates and sources listed only as candidate snrs .",
    "this yields 54 confirmed snrs in the lmc and 23 in the smc , which we list in table 1 . in figure  [ fig - himaps ]",
    ", we plot the positions of these 77 snrs on the hi maps of the mcs published by @xcite and @xcite .    because we are interested mostly in reliable sizes ( to derive the histograms in ",
    "[ distribution ] ) and positions ( to calculate the delay time distribution in paper  ii ) , we take the centres and diameters of the snrs from high resolution x - ray observations ( _ chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _ ) , whenever possible .",
    "if no high - resolution x - ray data are available , we revert to the sizes and centers listed in the original catalogues , which were determined on a case - by - case basis , usually selecting the wavelength that provided the cleanest measurement ( see table 1 and references for details ) .",
    "we have found that high - resolution x - ray data provide the most reliable measurements for several x - ray bright and radio faint objects , which are often small and have boundaries that are hard to resolve clearly using single - dish radio data .",
    "for the bulk population , sizes determined at different wavelengths might disagree in individual cases , but this does not have a large impact on the final distribution of sizes , as long as the data sets are of reasonable quality ( e.g. , see figure 7 and related discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "figure  [ sizedist ] shows the cumulative and differential histograms of remnant sizes in the lmc and in the smc . in both clouds ,",
    "the cumulative distributions are roughly linear in remnant size , i.e. , with an equal number of remnants per equal size bin in the differential distributions , up to a cutoff at a physical radius @xmath17  pc .        because the data points in a cumulative histogram are not independent of one another ,",

    "we conclude that the snr size distribution in both clouds is consistent with being roughly uniform , although there are hints for a deviation at small radii in the smc .",
    "it is possible that a deficit at small radii is also present in the lmc distribution ( see figure [ sizedist ] ) , but the poisson errors are too large to claim that the data require it .",

    "all of these papers considered smaller snr samples , often based on much shallower radio data and , with few exceptions , did not include multi - wavelength observations .",
    "some of these authors interpreted the observed size distribution as evidence that most mc snrs are in their `` free expansion '' phase , during which the shock velocity is constant , and inferred that these snrs expand into an extremely low - density medium .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite warned that the observed distribution was the result of selection effects ; most objects they discussed had been selected in x - rays , and the x - ray flux limits then led to the exclusion of larger and fainter remnants , and their faint radio counterparts .",
    "our present compilation is bigger , it incorporates the most recent multi - wavelength data , it extends to larger sizes , and most importantly , it is sensitive to radio flux densities two orders of magnitude below the observed luminosity floor . with these data",
    "we now confirm the luminosity floor , the uniform size distribution , and the cutoff at @xmath39  pc in the magellanic cloud snrs .",

    "our method to estimate the maximum likelihood index yields @xmath42 .",
    "graphically , a linear function with the correct normalization reproduces the cumulative histogram quite well ( see figure [ sizedistm33 ] ) .",
    "a significant deficit of snrs at radii below 10 pc is also obvious in the data .",
    "@xcite warn that a few small ( young ) snrs might have escaped detection ( see their section 9 ) , but given the numbers involved , most of the deficit may be real .",
    "this indicates a deviation at small diameters from the uniform distribution along the lines of the one we noted in the mcs .",
    "the available data seem to indicate that the distribution of snr sizes in m33 and the magellanic clouds is indeed close to uniform between @xmath43 pc and a sharp cutoff at @xmath44 pc . in the case of m33",
    ", this conclusion needs to be validated by a careful assessment of the completeness of the snr sample , although from the discussion in   7.3 of @xcite it seems unlikely that a large number of m33 snrs have escaped detection .",
    "unfortunately , snr samples of this quality are hard to obtain for other galaxies , so it is difficult to verify how widespread these features of the snr size distribution are in reality",
    ". we will return briefly to this issue in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the following section , we argue that a uniform size distribution , including a deficit of snrs at small radii and a sharp cutoff at a certain radius , arises naturally from the physics of snr evolution and the distribution of densities in the interstellar medium .",
    "the evolution of snrs is usually separated into three phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the first , free - expansion , phase , the mass swept up by the expanding shock is small compared to the ejected mass , and the shock velocity is constant with time . in the sedov - taylor phase , the swept - up mass is larger than the ejecta mass , and the expansion decelerates .",
    "however , the cooling time of the shocked gas is still longer than the age of the remnant , and the evolution is approximately adiabatic . once the cooling time becomes comparable to the age , the snr quickly loses energy radiatively , entering the radiation - loss - dominated snowplough phase , after which it slows down , breaks up , and merges with the interstellar medium .",
    "quantitative estimates show that typical snrs should be in their sedov - taylor phases for ages between a few and a few tens of kyrs , and for sizes of order a few to a few tens of parsecs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , most of the mc snrs in our sample should be in the sedov - taylor phase of their expansions , with radii growing as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the kinetic energy of the explosion , @xmath47 is the ambient gas density , and @xmath48 is the time .",
    "the shock velocity therefore decreases as @xmath49 or equivalently expressed in terms of @xmath50 rather than @xmath48 , @xmath51 reasonably assuming a constant sn rate in the lmc over the past few kyrs , @xmath52 , the naively expected size distribution of snrs in their sedov phase is @xmath53 where we have used eq .",
    "[ vsimrhor ] to substitute for @xmath54 .",
    "this is contrary to the observed nearly uniform ( @xmath55 ) distribution .",
    "as noted above , this has been interpreted before either as evidence for free expansion , or for selection effects , where fading of the older ( and hence larger ) remnants takes them below the detection limits , and culls the pileup in the distribution expected at large sizes for a decelerating population .",
    "both explanations are unlikely for our mc snr sample .",
    "we propose , instead , that the uniform size distribution arises as a result of the transition from the sedov phase to the radiative phase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radius of this transition depends on ambient density , with snrs evolving in dense environments becoming radiative sooner than snrs in low - density regions .",
    "when coupled with the distribution of densities in the clouds , this leads to fewer and fewer sites at which large - radius sedov - phase snrs can exist .",
    "we show this as follows .",
    "the cooling time of the shocked gas depends on the density as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the cooling function at temperature @xmath58 .",
    "following , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , @xmath57 can be approximated with piecewise power laws , with a dependence of @xmath59 in the temperature range of relevance for the shocked gas , around @xmath60 . by relating the temperature to the shock velocity @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the proton mass ) , and equating @xmath64 to the age @xmath48 as expressed in eq .",
    "[ sedovv ] , one obtains that the transition radius , @xmath65 , scales as ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) @xmath66 a remnant expanding beyond this radius , at the given ambient density , will enter the radiative phase and quickly fade from view . for a fairly large range of plausible cooling function dependences , e.g. , indices @xmath67 of @xmath68 to @xmath69 , @xmath70 depends on density as @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "conversely , the maximum ambient density that will permit a sedov - phase snr of radius @xmath50 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is likely in the range @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "the expected size distribution of remnants will now be @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the distribution of gas densities in a given galaxy , and @xmath79 is the minimum density in that galaxy , on the size scales relevant for snrs .",
    "let us parametrize the density distribution as a power law of index @xmath80 , @xmath81 with @xmath82 . then , substituting in eq .",
    "[ dndr ] , integrating , and expressing @xmath83 in terms of @xmath50 using eq .",
    "[ rhomaxvsr ] , gives a remnant size distribution @xmath84 a uniform size distribution , @xmath85 , is obtained if @xmath86 ( for @xmath87 ) or @xmath88 ( for @xmath89 ) .",
    "in other words , the observed , roughly uniform , snr size distribution implies a powerlaw distribution of densities with index @xmath90 .",
    "we note that , because of the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath64 , @xmath70 can depend on the metallicity of the gas , @xmath91 . assuming a cooling function proportional to @xmath91 , eq . [ rmaxwithepsilon ] , in addition to the dependence on @xmath47 and @xmath46 , will depend on @xmath91 as @xmath92 however , in dwarf galaxies like the mcs , where @xmath91 does not change much from one location to another , this will be a small effect .",
    "for example , if @xmath93 , changing @xmath91 by a factor 5 would only change @xmath70 by @xmath94 .",
    "the existence of a cutoff in the distribution beyond some size is naturally expected in the above picture , given the existence of some minimum density @xmath95 in the regions of the galaxies where sne explode , and in view of the decrease of @xmath83 with radius . at some radius , @xmath83 will equal @xmath95 and the integral in eq .",
    "[ dndr ] will therefore become zero .",
    "in other words , there will be nowhere in the mcs a region with a density low enough to permit a snr of that size that is still in its bright sedov phase .    a deficit of snrs at small radii , as observed in m33 and the mcs , is also expected in this scenario . before the onset of the sedov stage , faster shock velocities will lead to fewer objects observed in the bins with the smallest radii .",
    "this onset happens at ages ( sizes ) that depend on the details of the ejecta structure , as well as the ambient density ( see   7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but for most snrs it should occur around a few hundred years ( a few pc ) , which is consistent with the deficits that we have observed in m33 and the mcs .",
    "this regime affects only a small number of objects in the mcs , and does not impact any of the arguments made above , so we will ignore it for the remainder of the paper .",
    "we have also ignored the deviations from the standard evolutionary picture that can be introduced by the shape of the circumstellar medium excavated by the sn progenitors .",
    "@xcite showed that most type ia snrs with known ages have sizes that are consistent with an interaction with a uniform ambient medium , but no such study has been done for cc snrs .",
    "the fast stellar outflows expected from the more massive cc sn progenitors will modify the sizes of a few individual snrs at certain stages of their evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but most of the objects that we consider here are too large to be expanding in even the most extreme wind - blown cavities . as long as the bulk of the snrs in the sample spend most of their lifetimes in the sedov stage , this should not affect our scenario .",
    "similarly , the fact that some snrs evolve inside superbubbles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is naturally incorporated into our picture  superbubbles merely become one more of the factors driving the density distribution in the interstellar medium .",
    "incidentally , the size distribution of superbubbles also relates to the properties of the interstellar medium , as shown by @xcite for several nearby galaxies , including the smc .",
    "as we have seen , a uniform snr size distribution can be understood as the result of sedov expansion , combined with a transition to the radiative phase at an age that depends on the local density , provided that the density of the gas in the interstellar medium follows a distribution close to a power law with an index of @xmath96 , @xmath97 . in this section",
    ", we test this hypothesis by examining three indirect tracers of gas density in the magellanic clouds : hi column density ; star - formation rate ( sfr ) based on resolved stellar populations ; and h@xmath3 emission - line surface brightness .",
    "these tracers are well suited for our goals because they are valid over a wide range of densities , and the necessary data are available from public surveys that cover the whole extent of the clouds , as described in detail below .      we have taken the surface brightness of hi 21  cm line emission in the mcs from the maps of @xcite and @xcite , which combine single - dish parkes and aperture - synthesis atca data to probe both small and large scales in the lmc and the smc , respectively .",
    "the 21  cm emission is optically thin , so the surface brightness is directly proportional to the hi column density . since the lmc possesses a fairly face - on ( inclination @xmath98 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , well - ordered hi disk , the column density should , in turn , be roughly proportional to the volume density @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite report that the hi column density distribution of individual `` clouds '' of neutral hydrogen in the lmc follows a log - normal form , rather than a power law .",
    "however , their figure  13 suggests that , above a low cutoff of @xmath99 , the distribution does behave as a power law of slope @xmath2 , over at least an order of magnitude .",
    "to re - examine this , in figure [ hihist ] we show the differential distribution of hi column density in the individual beam - sized pixels of the @xcite lmc map ( as opposed to the cumulative plot for  clouds  shown in * ? ? ?",
    "we see that the hi column in the lmc does follow an index @xmath96 power law fairly well , between a column of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the observed low cutoff in the column density is unavoidable because of the integration through the disk and over the beam size ( every line of sight is basically sampling the densest regions at that point ) . in regions with low density",
    ", the h atoms might be ionized , as in the `` warm ionized '' phase of the interstellar medium @xcite , so the tracer may become less reliable there .",
    "it is quite plausible that , in the regions where sne actually explode , the underlying distribution of densities also reaches a minimum  as we recall , a minimum density is required in order to reproduce the observed upper cutoff in snr size  but this does not necessarily correspond with the lower threshold in the hi distribution . to illustrate this , we have calculated the mean hi columns in each of the spatial `` cells '' defined by @xcite and @xcite that contain snrs ( see   [ sec : sfr ] below for a description of the cells ) , which we display with the horizontal rulers in figure [ hihist ] .",
    "we note that , in the lmc , these cells have average column values between @xmath102 ( close to , but higher than the low hi cutoff ) and @xmath103 , although most snrs appear clustered around @xmath104 .",
    "that intersect the data at a column of @xmath105 .",
    "the column density values for the cells that contain the snrs in both galaxies have been represented by tick marks on the horizontal rulers.,scaledwidth=32.0% ]    as shown in figure [ hihist ] , the distribution of hi column densities in the smc is flat over the same range , although the rise and fall from the plateau happen at the same densities as the rise and fall of the powerlaw in the lmc . while we do not know the reason for this",
    ", we speculate that it may be related to an smc geometry that is elongated along our line of sight , and the integration effect that results . the actual `` depth '' of the smc , whether just a few kpc or as much as 20  kpc ,",
    "is debated @xcite , but is likely at least a few times larger than that of the nearly face - on lmc .",
    "such an integration effect would explain why the smc snrs are found at hi column densities that are a factor @xmath64 higher than the lmc snrs ( see horizontal rulers in figure [ hihist ] ) .",
    "two other tracers of density , examined below , do suggest a @xmath96 power law in the smc , as well as in the lmc , and do not display this offset in snr ambient densities .      as a second way to estimate the local gas densities and test the powerlaw density distribution hypothesis , we use star formation rates ( sfrs ) calculated from the star - formation history ( sfh ) maps of the mcs published by @xcite and @xcite , which are based on resolved stellar populations .",
    "the maps were elaborated using four - band ( _ u , b , v _ , and _ i _ ) photometry from the magellanic clouds photometric survey @xcite , which has a limiting magnitude between 20 and 21 in _ v _",
    ", depending on the local degree of crowding in the images . in each cloud",
    ", the data were divided into regions or `` cells '' with enough stars to produce color - magnitude diagrams of sufficient quality , which were then fed into the starfish code @xcite to derive the local sfh for each cell . for the lmc",
    ", @xcite divided more than 20 million stars into spatial cells encompassing the central 8@xmath106 of the galaxy ( see their figure 4 ) . in total , they produced 1376 cells for the lmc , most of them @xmath107 in size , and about 50 cells in regions of lower stellar density with a larger size ( @xmath108 ) . for the smc , @xcite divided over 6 million stars into 351 @xmath107 cells , leaving out two areas that are contaminated by galactic globular clusters in the foreground ( see their figure 3 ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide the sfh for each of these cells , which we use in paper  ii to derive the delay time distribution of sne in the clouds , but for our present purposes we are only interested in the current sfr , which we have obtained by averaging the star formation in each cell over the last 35  myr .",
    "the @xcite law relates star formation to gas mass column , @xmath109 , roughly as @xmath110 .",

    "figure  [ sfhist ] shows that , above a value of @xmath124 , the sfr is indeed distributed as a power law of index @xmath96 , over more than one order of magnitude in sfr , for both the lmc and the smc . to meaningfully compare the sfrs in cells with different physical areas , we have counted the few @xmath125 cells in the lmc as four @xmath123 cells with the same sfr , and we have scaled down the sfrs of all the @xmath123 cells in the smc by a factor of 1.44 , to account for the fact that this galaxy is 20% more distant than the lmc .     that intersect the data at a sfr of @xmath126 .",
    "the sfr values for the cells that contain the snrs in both galaxies are represented by tick marks on the horizontal rulers.,scaledwidth=32.0% ]      rather than measuring sfr via the resolved stellar populations of the mcs , we can trace it by means of h@xmath3 emission , which gives us a third probe of gas density .",
    "h@xmath3 is principally powered by photoionisation from o - type stars , whose numbers are proportional to the sfr .",
    "the schmidt law again connects this sfr to the gas mass column .",
    "we have examined the continuum - subtracted h@xmath3 emission maps of the lmc and smc from the shassa survey of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ hahist ] shows that both the lmc and the smc have distributions of h@xmath3 surface brightness that follow power laws of index @xmath2 , this time over 2 orders of magnitude for the smc , and almost 3 for the lmc .",
    "as before , through the schmidt law , this implies a power law with index @xmath96 for the gas density distribution over 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in density .",
    "surface brightness is independent of distance for such nearby galaxies , and can therefore be compared directly between the lmc and smc .",
    "surface brightness in the lmc ( red ) and the smc ( blue ) .",

    "the flux values for the cells that contain the snrs in both galaxies are represented by tick marks on the horizontal rulers.,scaledwidth=32.0% ]      the density tracers that we have examined here are not free of biases , but they should provide a fairly accurate picture of the density distribution in the interstellar medium of the mcs .",
    "specific regions within the clouds , like the lmc bar or 30 dor , will probably have density distributions that are different from the simple powerlaws we have found here ; our analysis only applies to the bulk , statistical properties of the gas on galactic scales .",
    "several theoretical studies have adressed the probability distribution of densities in the interstellar medium : see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the consensus of these studies is that , despite local inhomogeneities and deviations , a combination of galaxy - wide and local mechanisms conspire to produce a lognormal distribution of densities in the gas for a wide range of conditions . at the higher densities where",
    "most stars are formed and most sne explode , the tail of the lognormal distribution is well reproduced by a power law with an index @xmath2 ( see figure 19 in * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with our findings for the mcs .",
    "the derivation in   [ physics ] ignores many subtleties in what is clearly a complex problem , involving different physical processes and temporal scales . in this context",
    ", the fact that the distribution of gas densities in the mcs seems to behave like a power law with an index @xmath128 does not _ prove _ that our proposed picture for the evolution of snrs is correct .",
    "however , our simple ( but physically motivated ) scenario appears to explain the available observations quite well , and is consistent with what we know about the bulk properties of the interstellar gas in the mcs . furthermore , there are indirect ways to test that the basic scenario is sound .    in paper",
    "ii , we use the compilation of snr observations from table 1 and the sfh maps of @xcite and @xcite to derive the sn rate and delay time distribution in the magellanic clouds . some key results from that exercise , which we describe briefly here ,",
    "serve as plausibility arguments for our picture of snr evolution .",
    "a basic ingredient in the derivation of sn rates is the `` visibility time '' of snrs ( i.e. , the time during which a snr would be visible , if it were there ) .",
    "we have identified this time with the transition to the radiative phase in   [ physics ] , but without assigning any specific value to it .",
    "this can not be done using theoretical arguments alone , because many of the necessary parameters are not known with sufficient accuracy , like the distribution of sn kinetic energies or the normalization of the cooling function ( see eq .  [ rmaxwithepsilon ] ) .",
    "the visibility time can not be calibrated using individual objects either , because the only snrs that have reliable ages from light echoes or historical observations are much younger than the old snrs in the sedov stage that form the bulk of our sample .    in paper  ii , this conundrum is solved by imposing a condition on the delay time distribution : that the vast majority of stars more massive than @xmath129 explode as core collapse sne , with very few `` silent '' events that collapse directly to form a black hole without much ejection of material and hence without leaving a snr behind .",
    "if this condition holds , an absolute value for the snr visibility time can be obtained by equating the time - integrated sn rate in the temporal bin of the delay time distribution that is associated with core collapse sne ( in the binning used in paper  ii , that is all sne with delays shorter than 35 myr ) to the number of massive stars per total stellar mass formed .",
    "this procedure yields snr visibility times that depend on the tracer used to determine the local density , and vary between @xmath130 kyr ( for the hi density tracer ) and @xmath131 kyr ( for the sfr - based density tracer  see table 2 in paper  ii ) .",
    "these ages are for regions where the local density corresponds to the mean value of the tracer , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively ( see figures [ hihist ] and [ sfhist ] ) ; for values 10 times lower than the mean , the visibility times could be a factor 3 to 4 longer ( see paper  ii for details ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the maximum ages of snr shells inferred by snr - pulsar associations in the milky way , which are @xmath134 kyr @xcite .",
    "another key result from paper  ii is the total rate of sne ( cc and type ia ) in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the rate depends again on the density tracer used to estimate the visibility time , and varies between @xmath135 ( for hi ) and @xmath136 ( using sfr as the tracer ) .",
    "these rates , and the visibility times quoted in the previous paragraph , are derived assuming that our snr sample is complete and our evolution scenario is correct . as explained in paper  ii , the rates , when normalized per unit stellar mass , are typical of dwarf irregular galaxies , of which the mcs are prototypes .",
    "the rates are also in loose agreement with the historical records , which show 2 sne in the mcs in the last 400 yr ( i.e. , roughly @xmath137 , see discussion in   5.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this number of events is too small to put strong constraints on the sn rate .",
    "adopting the assumption that most snrs are actually in free expansion and not in the sedov stage , as has been invoked by a number of authors to explain the observed uniform size distribution ( see   [ distribution ] ) , would lead to inconsistencies .",
    "undecelerated sn ejecta reach velocities in excess of 10000  km  s@xmath12 , so we would expect the shock velocities in freely expanding snrs to be in the range @xmath138 to 10000  km  s@xmath12 . at these velocities ,",
    "the cutoff radius of @xmath139  pc would translate to maximum ages of 3 to 6 kyr .",
    "the 77 snrs in the mcs would then imply a sn explosion in the mcs once every 40 to 80 years , on average , or even more frequently if our snr sample is incomplete . finally ,",
    "if the visibility time were fixed at 6  kyr , for instance , this would correspond to a cc - sn yield ( i.e. , the number of cc sne per stellar mass formed ) of @xmath140 ( see paper  ii ) . to produce",
    "so many cc - sne all stars with initial mass above @xmath141 in a standard imf would have to explode , which is in direct contradiction to stellar evolution theory , and to the semi - empirical initial - final mass relation for wds @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a physically motivated scenario for the evolution of snrs in the interstellar medium of galaxies , and we have applied it to the sample of snrs in the magellanic clouds .",
    "we compiled multi - wavelength observations of the 77 known snrs in the mcs from the existing literature ( table 1 and figure [ fig - himaps ] ) .",
    "we verified that this compilation is fairly complete , and that the size distribution of snrs is approximately flat , within the allowed uncertainties , up to a cutoff at @xmath40 pc , as discussed by other authors before .",
    "we noted that these features are also present in the larger snr sample assembled by @xcite for m33 . in our model",
    ", the flat size distribution can be explained if most snrs are in the sedov , decelerating , stage of their expansion , quickly fading below detection as soon as they reach the radiative stage at an age ( size ) that depends on the local density . under these circumstances ,",
    "a flat distribution of snr sizes arises naturally if the probability distribution of densities in the gas follows a power law with index @xmath96 . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have examined the distributions of three different density tracers in the clouds : hi column density , h@xmath3 flux , and sfr obtained from resolved stellar populations .",
    "we have verified that these tracers do indeed indicate a density distribution that follows a power law with index @xmath96 , over a wide range of densities , and that this agrees with our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of the interstellar medium .",
    "our scenario implies that snrs will remain visible for different times at different locations in the magellanic clouds , depending on the local density .",
    "this visibility time is a key ingredient in the calculation of sn rates and sn delay time distributions , which we derive for the magellanic clouds in paper  ii .",
    "the absolute value of the visibility time can not be determined from theoretical arguments alone , but we have used the results from paper  ii to verify that the range of values we obtain ( @xmath142 to @xmath143 kyr for regions of mean density , depending on the tracer ) is consistent with the existing limits for the maximum ages of snrs , and with basic stellar evolution theory .    it would be interesting to extend our analysis of snr sizes and interstellar medium densities to other galaxies in the local group . on the one hand , this would allow us to test the validity of our snr evolution scenario in different settings .",
    "on the other hand , the techniques developed here and in paper  ii would yield more accurate sn rates and more detailed delay time distributions with larger snr samples , provided the sfhs in the host galaxies could be determined with enough spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "a growing number of nearby galaxies have published snr catalogues , but samples of the quality of the one we have assembled here for the magellanic clouds or the one published by @xcite for m33 are hard to obtain .",
    "interstellar extinction and distance uncertainties plague the milky way snrs , and the radio detection limits become comparable to the fluxes of the fainter magellanic cloud snrs for distances beyond several hundred kpc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a judicious investment of observing time , however ,",
    "reasonably complete multi - wavelength catalogues of snrs in a few well - suited nearby galaxies could become available in the near future .",
    "we are grateful to jos luis prieto , who first suggested using resolved stellar populations around snrs to constrain the properties of sn progenitors . we want to thank the referee for a careful reading of the manuscript , and dennis zaritsky for many helpful discussions about several details of the sfh maps of the mcs .",
