    "it is natural to ask for the minimum @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is a sum of ( polynomial ) squares .",
    "we answer this question in theorem [ mainthm ] by showing that the minimum value is @xmath6    for simplicity , we use one - subscript notation for the entries of @xmath7 and @xmath8 described by means of the `` small '' index matrix @xmath9 then @xmath7 and @xmath10 can be generated by vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 of dimension @xmath13 as @xmath14 introducing an index matrix will be especially useful in sections [ sec3 ] to [ sec5 ] , where tridiagonal , backward tridiagonal , cyclic hankel and general toeplitz matrices will be investigated .",
    "for these special cases we prove ( for toeplitz matrices : conjecture ) that the corresponding @xmath15 form is a sum of squares ( sos ) .",
    "it is quite odd that although ( real ) hankel matrices are symmetric , thus normal , hence nonnegativity easily follows @xcite , this does not imply that a sos form also exists ( except if @xmath16 , example [ hankel3 ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "[ hankel3 ] the case of ( general ) third order hankel matrices .",
    "the index matrix ind is now @xmath235 the order of @xmath236 and the constraint matrices @xmath237 is @xmath238 the number of the @xmath63-s is @xmath239 by help of vector @xmath240 and matrix @xmath30 the objective can be written as @xmath241 which becomes  by means of a standard sdp relaxation ",
    "trace@xmath242 our matlab program yields @xmath243 i.e. only one constraint will be active , giving @xmath244 ( in the original @xmath30 the six entries in braces are zero . )",
    "the last zero in @xmath34 indicates the sos representability . to obtain the concrete sos form , we calculated the eigen - decomposition of the three blocks @xmath245 with integer eigenvalues @xmath246 and ( unnormalized , integer , columnwise ) eigenvectors @xmath247    we sum up the result : with @xmath248 the following identity holds for the bw form generated by two third order hankel matrices : @xmath249",
    "in this section @xmath7 and @xmath10 will be arbitrary real toeplitz matrices .",
    "observe that the main diagonal entries do nt play any role ( to prove this use temporarily the more standard notation @xmath250 and @xmath251 then the @xmath252 entry in @xmath253 $ ] equals @xmath254 while @xmath255 ) .",
    "hence we can reduce the number of variables to get e.g. for @xmath16 the index matrix @xmath256    another speciality is that now there occur repeated terms as well . to handle these , introduce the multiplicity vector @xmath257 of dimension @xmath258 by @xmath259 then the following easily proved representation holds .      in view of the lemma",

    "some further properties of @xmath33 of arbitrary order @xmath115 are : the minimum off - diagonal entry of @xmath33 is @xmath273 the defect of @xmath130 i.e. the multiplicity of zero as eigenvalue is @xmath274 the maximal diagonal entry and also the maximal eigenvalue is @xmath275 moreover , @xmath33 is a direct sum of two types of submatrices of the following order :          the largest block @xmath277 of type ( a ) is crucial .",
    "it has a decomposition @xmath280 with @xmath281 diagonal , @xmath282 hermitian ( i.e. symmetric ) , both of order @xmath283 the diagonal elements of @xmath281 are @xmath284 in reverse order : @xmath285 matrix @xmath282 is also of a special structure : the elements on the border are @xmath286 those on the neighboring border are @xmath287 and so on .",
    "this matrix is p.s.d . for @xmath288 but has at least one negative eigenvalue for @xmath289    the further submatrices of type ( a ) also are critical , e.g. the next one ( of order @xmath290 ) has a similar form with diagonal elements @xmath291 in @xmath292 while @xmath282 is the same ( of the appropriate size ) .",
    "therefore there is a second negative eigenvalue for @xmath293 and so on . in general , the symmetric matrices @xmath282 are of the same form , and the diagonal entries of @xmath281 are @xmath294    matrices of order @xmath295 in this case @xmath7 and @xmath10 have @xmath296 nonzero elements , the candidate vector @xmath264 has dimension @xmath297 the total number of constraints is @xmath298 and the number of active constraints is @xmath299    it always suffices to examine the first row and the first column of @xmath300 for all other entries are contained in these , e.g. @xmath301 and @xmath302 the number of the active constraints for @xmath303 , coming from row 1 and column 1 is indeed 6 + 2 ( 3 + 1 ) = 14 , as stated above .",
    "this can be proved by induction , by noting that @xmath304    as regards the @xmath34 coordinates , since the product @xmath305 occurs two times ( as the above formulae show ) , we write @xmath306 in the suitable positions ( overwriting the @xmath159-s ) to get @xmath307 and so on .",
    "the case @xmath309 the matrices @xmath281 and @xmath282 are now : @xmath310 the characteristic polynomial of the block @xmath311 factorizes into @xmath312 where @xmath313 and @xmath314 has a negative zero : 0.2228 .",
    "( all other zeroes of @xmath314 and @xmath315 are positive . )",
    "finally we mention that although the above strategy works only up to @xmath316 the standard semidefinite program yields results indicating that bw can be sos for some larger orders , too , hence we guess that bw is sos in general .",
    "the difficulty is that the corresponding dual variables @xmath317 of the program are not recognizable real numbers .",
