    "the dynamical processes governing massive star formation are much less understood than is the case for low - mass stars @xcite . the various observational `` appearances '' of low - mass star formation ( t  tauri stars ,",
    "fu  orionis stars , infrared class i - iii sources , molecular outflows , ... ) have been linked into a single , if rough , general evolutionary scenario @xcite .",
    "in contrast , no clear evolutionary sequence has been established for high - mass stars .",
    "objects such as the bn  object in orion are highly embedded and emit the bulk of their luminosity in the mid- and far - infrared .",
    "ultracompact ( uc ) regions are small ( @xmath24  pc ) sources of free - free emission at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "`` hot core''-type objects have bright molecular line emission at submillimeter wavelengths , which indicate temperatures of several @xmath25  k and high abundances of saturated carbon - bearing molecules ( e.g. , blake et al .",
    "they usually lack detectable radio emission , which might be due to `` quenching '' by material accreting at rates @xmath26  yr@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the distinction between uc   regions and hot cores is not always clear , and the two are often found located very close to each other @xcite . as a step towards understanding the evolution of massive ysos , this paper presents models for a sample of fourteen such objects .",
    "the formation of high - mass stars is invisible at optical wavelengths because of the high opacity of the surrounding material , so that reliable age estimates for massive protostellar objects are difficult to obtain",
    ". such estimates for massive protostars have traditionally come from the morphology of the radio continuum emission @xcite , but this method applies only to relatively evolved objects .",
    "more recently , the size to velocity ratio or dynamical time scale of molecular outflows has been used as a measure of age , but the derived age depends strongly on the adopted dynamical model @xcite .",
    "the chemical composition of the material is a potentially powerful clock , but difficult to calibrate @xcite .",
    "the density and temperature structure of the circumstellar material are also expected to change as the central star develops . for the density , power laws @xmath27",
    "are predicted by many theoretical models .",
    "before collapse begins , low - mass cores may relax to a power law , with @xmath28 for thermal support @xcite , and @xmath29 for turbulent support @xcite .",
    "once collapse begins , the density distribution tends toward @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the temperature structure @xmath31 is determined by the luminosity , the dust opacities , and @xmath32 .",
    "since the response of @xmath31 to changes in luminosity is rapid , we use the observed luminosity to determine @xmath31 . besides giving information on the dynamics of star formation , a good model of the physical structure of objects",
    "is a prerequisite for determining their chemical composition , which then by itself can be used as a powerful additional evolutionary indicator .",
    "the physical conditions around newly - born massive stars also reveal some of the influence that such stars have on their surroundings , which is of interest for the effects of star formation on large ( @xmath33  1  pc ) scales .    the physical structure of massive yso envelopes has been studied based on dust continuum observations by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such studies are sensitive to the column density and the temperature of the envelope , but not to density itself . a major source of uncertainty for all dust models",
    "is the choice of optical properties of the grains , which limits the accuracy of derived envelope masses to a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "molecular rotational lines are direct probes of the  density and are also sensitive to temperature . @xcite and @xcite investigated the structure of massive star - forming regions using lines of cs ,  and other molecules with large dipole moments . however , in these studies , the column density ( or the cloud mass ) was not independently constrained .",
    "doing this requires knowledge of the molecular abundance , information which is generally unavailable except in the case of co , which is relatively inert and much more abundant than most molecules .",
    "still , part of the co may be frozen out onto grain surfaces in the cold regions far from embedded stars .",
    "this paper uses observations of both the dust and the molecular gas to constrain the physical structure of the envelopes of a sample of massive young stars .",
    "the study builds on the method of analysis developed in a previous paper for one source , gl 2591 , by @xcite .",
    "the column density is inferred from continuum observations , and the density from molecular lines , while the temperature is calculated self - consistently from the luminosity , dust properties , and @xmath32 .",
    "we use the derived density and temperature profiles to characterize the early evolution of massive stars and their surroundings .",
    "the fourteen sources studied in this paper are introduced in table  1 , which lists the source names , positions , distances , luminosities , radio continuum flux densities and associated iras point source catalog ( psc ) entries .",
    "all sources have been well studied before at radio and infrared wavelengths .",
    "they were selected to be luminous ( @xmath34  ) and visible from the northern hemisphere .",
    "the distances to some of the sources are quite uncertain ; in particular , for the sources in the cygnus  x region , we use a fiducial distance of 1  kpc @xcite , for ease of scaling once better distances are available .",
    "the main sample consists of nine deeply embedded massive young stars , which were additionally selected for mid - infrared brightness ( @xmath35  jy at @xmath36  ) , allowing comparison to existing absorption line studies .",
    "a combined analysis of emission and absorption lines gives powerful constraints on the physical structure and geometry of the system , and allows a nearly complete inventory of the chemical composition of both the solid and the gas phases .",
    "these nine sources have been extensively studied in the infrared , both from the ground @xcite and with the infrared space observatory @xcite . as a comparison sample ,",
    "five luminous embedded young stars which are weak in the mid - infrared are studied , whose surroundings contain a `` hot core '' and/or an ultracompact region .",
    "the full sample contains sources with luminosities between @xmath37  and @xmath38  and distances between @xmath39  and @xmath40  kpc .",
    "the radio flux densities are at the @xmath41mjy level for most sources , which is orders of magnitude lower than expected from an region photoionized by a star with the same luminosity .",
    "the radio emission from the bright mid - infrared sources has a spectral index @xmath42 in the range @xmath43 and may arise in a spherical wind for which @xmath44 .",
    "the principal difference between our main sample and that of other studies of massive young stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) is the selection on mid - infrared brightness , which could introduce an orientation bias , in the sense that low - density cavities such as produced by molecular outflows may be preferentially directed towards us .",
    "alternatively , the high mid - infrared brightness may be an evolutionary effect .",
    "depending on the relative importance of different effects , the mid - infrared bright sources in the main sample could be younger or older than the sources in the comparison sample .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail in section  [ sec : evol ] .",
    "the sources were selected on isolated location within @xmath45 at infrared wavelengths , so that the heating is dominated by the central star . however , while gl  2591 and gl  490 are examples of objects forming in isolation , ngc  6334 , s  140 , ngc  7538 and w  3 are regions where low - mass stars are also born , as revealed by near - infrared images @xcite . in addition , s  140 contains three massive objects separated by @xmath46 , which contribute about equally to the far - infrared luminosity @xcite .",
    "for the other sources , this information is not available . in the case of w  3  irs5",
    ", radio continuum observations @xcite suggest the presence of seven early b - type stars within @xmath47 , a very large number in view of the average mass function and stellar density in young clusters @xcite . as long as the power source is much smaller than our beam",
    ", its multiplicity does not matter for our analysis .    in several cases ,",
    "high - resolution continuum observations reveal the presence of an ( ultra-)compact  region next to the source of interest .",
    "since luminosity and/or mass are dominated by the infrared source , our models of centrally heated sources are still reasonable approximations .",
    "spectroscopy of selected molecular lines in the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50  ghz bands was performed with the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii during various runs in 19951997 . in total ,",

    "the cs line profiles are presented in figure  [ f : jcmt_res ] .",
    "in addition to a strong , single - peaked line core , which is also detected in isotopic lines ( , ) and which has an approximately gaussian shape , high - velocity wings are clearly detected .",
    "these wings are more prominent in @xmath74 than in higher-@xmath110 lines , are also detected in the strongest  lines , and must arise on small scales , since they are stronger in the iram  30 m beam than in the jcmt beam .",
    "the wings are not detected in the w  3 sources , for which we do not have @xmath111 data .",
    "since the sources studied in this paper are known to drive co outflows , it is natural to associate the cs and  wings with dense gas in these outflows .    in all bright mid - infrared sources studied in this paper except w  33a ,",
    "blueshifted infrared absorption of co is detected at similar velocities as in co rotational line emission @xcite , and in the cases of w  3  irs5 and gl  2591 up to much higher velocities , implying that the outflow is directed along the line of sight . in realistic outflow models with a finite opening angle , a mixture of blue- and redshifted emission is expected on both sides of the driving source , which should be visible in submillimeter emission .",
    "however , the wings seen on the cs and  lines are much stronger at blueshifted than at redshifted velocities , and for some sources no redshifted wing emission is detected at all . since the line asymmetry is stronger in the iram  30 m spectrum of cs @xmath74 than in the jcmt profile of the same line , the asymmetry must arise on scales of @xmath112 . since the redshifted outflow lobe lies in the background",
    ", we suggest that the lack of redshifted co and cs wing emission is due to obscuration . since the outflow lies at a velocity offset , the absorption must be continuous absorption by dust . the  column density required to do",
    "this is @xmath113  on a @xmath112 scale , corresponding to a visual extinction of @xmath114 magnitudes .",
    "estimates of the mean temperature and density of the gas can be obtained by comparing observed line ratios of specific molecules with non - lte models which include radiative trapping .",
    "examples of this approach can be found in @xcite and @xcite ; it is similar to the `` large velocity gradient '' method used by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". the observed line ratios of are well - suited to constrain the  density .",
    "we have calculated synthetic line ratios for a range of temperatures and densities , using the rate coefficients by s.  green ( priv .",
    "cf.@xcite ) .",
    "comparison with the data indicates densities of @xmath115 to @xmath116  , but different line ratios generally give inconsistent answers for the same source , indicating the presence of density inhomogeneities , probably in the form of a gradient since lines observed with several telescopes are systematically brighter when observed with a smaller beam .",
    "the measured ratios of the  @xmath117/@xmath118 and the @xmath119/@xmath117 lines are particularly sensitive to temperature . unlike , these line ratios were measured in the same beam , or even in the same spectrum , improving the calibration between pairs of lines , although their filling factors might still be different .",
    "model calculations using collisional rate coefficients by @xcite give temperatures of @xmath120  k for s  140  irs1 to @xmath121  k for w  3  ( ) and ngc  6334  irs1 . again",
    ", the two ratios usually do not yield the same temperature for the same source , indicating the need for models with a varying temperature .",
    "in general , the modeling indicates somewhat higher temperatures and densities for the weak mid - infrared sources . in section  [ s : models ] , we will see that this effect is due to a steeper density gradient in these sources .",
    "the co column densities derived from c@xmath0o , using the temperatures and densities found above , are listed in column  3 of table  [ vlsr.tab ] .",
    "a plot of these values against the column densities derived by @xcite from infrared absorption observations is shown in figure  [ f : coldens ] . abundance ratios of @xmath122c/@xmath123c = 60 and @xmath124o/@xmath0o = 2500 @xcite are assumed .",
    "the two measurements agree to a factor of  2 for all sources , and often much better .",
    "this result implies that the circumstellar envelopes of our objects have to first order a spherical shape , with the infrared source in the center ( see also section  [ sec : struc ] ) .",
    "the average absorption column density is @xmath125% of the emission value , which is higher than half as expected in a uniform model .",
    "beam dilution in the emission data could explain this difference , in which case the sources are centrally condensed .",
    "the cs and c@xmath92o maps are presented in figure  [ f : lmaps ] ; figure  [ f : cmaps ] shows the sharc @xmath126  maps and maps of ngc  7538 at @xmath127  , obtained with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the jcmt , provided by g.  sandell ( 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "the maps appear compact but slightly extended . in a few cases ,",
    "the map peak is offset from the center position , but this offset falls within the @xmath64 pointing uncertainty .",
    "in the case of cs , this suggests that the infrared sources coincide with local density maxima in the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "the c@xmath92o maps are sometimes peaked at the same position as cs , which implies a maximum of the column density , but more often , these maps are not strongly peaked and have a much lower dynamic range than the cs maps .",
    "the map of ngc  7538 shows a chaotic structure , rather than clear peaks .",
    "column  4 of table  [ vlsr.tab ] lists the diameter of the cs @xmath111 emission , measured from the maps as the point where the brightness has dropped to 50% of the maximum .",
    "these numbers will be used in the next section to constrain the radii of the models .",
    "the values span a fairly narrow range : @xmath128 and do not show an obvious correlation with distance , suggesting that the cores do not have a single intrinsic linear size .",
    "instead , it appears that the molecular gas has a scale - free density structure , such as can be described by a power law .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that the cs diameters are somewhat ( @xmath23% ) larger than the beam size , which is also what power law models predict .",
    "the maps do not show a cutoff in the emission , such as would be produced if the star - forming cores had a distinct edge .",
    "rather , the brightness keeps going down until the detection limit .",
    "maps of a wider field and with a higher dynamic range than presented here may reveal if there is such an edge or if at large radii , the density gradient flattens out and the core merges into a surrounding molecular cloud . some objects , such as w  3  irs5 , dr  21 ( oh ) , ngc  6334 irs1 and the ngc  7538 sources , are clearly part of a more extended giant molecular cloud .",
    "however , the focus of this paper is on the @xmath45 region around the massive young stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : ovromaps ] presents maps created from the ovro data by gridding and fourier transforming the visibility data with uniform weighting .",
    "deconvolution with the clean algorithm and self - calibration of the @xmath129 phases based on the brightest clean components helped to improve the image quality .",
    "table  [ posflux.tab ] lists the positions and flux densities of the detected sources .",
    "the maps typically show a single compact source at or near phase center , within the @xmath130 positional error of the infrared positions from table  [ sam.tab ] .",
    "the extended @xmath131  ghz emission north of ngc  7538  irs1 is the  region surrounding ngc  7538  irs2 , which has also been detected at lower frequencies with the vla ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of",
    "w  33a , two sources are detected , neither of which coincides with the ir position of @xcite .",
    "the brightest source , mm1 , coincides however with a vla detection @xcite and with the infrared position by @xcite , who also report a second @xmath132  source @xmath133  south of w  33a , which may be related to mm2 .",
    "it is unknown if these two sources are physically associated ; if they are , they may represent a young massive binary star at a separation of @xmath134 or @xmath135  au . this separation is larger than the @xmath136  au found by @xcite for w  3  ( ) and by @xcite for a sample of low - mass young stellar objects , but comparable to that found by @xcite and @xcite for dr  21  ( oh ) .",
    "the flux densities found here for ngc  7538  irs1 are in agreement with those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectral index , measured from 107 to 230 ghz , is @xmath137 .",
    "the spectral indices of the sources in w  33a are @xmath138 ( mm1 ) and @xmath139 ( mm2 ) .",
    "the values of the spectral indices for w  33a rule out optically thin emission from either ionized gas or from dust .",
    "they are , however , consistent with black body emission , probably from a compact dust source . in paper  1 ,",
    "ovro observations of gl  2591 were presented which gave similar results ; we refer the reader to that paper for a detailed discussion .",
    "motivated by the results of the excitation analysis (   [ s : est_phys ] ) and of the cs maps (   [ s : res_maps ] ) , we will proceed by developing spherically symmetric power law models .",

    ", we used outer radii in our models that are twice @xmath143 .",
    "the inner radius was arbitrarily set to 1/300 of the outer radius , small enough not to influence the calculated brightness or temperature profile , as verified by test calculations for w  33a and gl  2591 .",
    "dust opacities appropriate for star - forming regions were taken from @xcite ( their model  5 ) and converted to absorption cross - sections using a grain mass density of @xmath146  g  and a radius of @xmath147  .",
    "this radius is close to the median of more realistic size distributions , so that the calculated dust temperatures represent the bulk of the dust ( cf .",
    "dust properties are known to vary from one region to the next @xcite and are likely to change inside our sources as well , due to the changing temperature ( @xcite ; see   [ s : ice ] ) .",
    "maps at several far - infrared wavelengths at @xmath112 resolution would allow us to disentangle temperature and dust opacity variations , but awaiting such data , we assume a constant grain opacity . with the luminosity , the distance and the size of the source fixed ,  was used as the only free parameter to match the observed submillimeter continuum emission .",

    "most submillimeter data are from this work and from @xcite ; the sources of the additional data are listed in the caption .",
    "the models have been constructed to fit the submillimeter ( @xmath148 ) data , and are seen to reproduce the observed emission at @xmath149  for every source , i.e.  up to optical depths of a few .",
    "the shorter - wavelength emission is in general not matched , although care was taken to include only photometry in small ( @xmath112 ) beams to avoid a contribution from reflection nebulosities .",
    "the high brightness of gl  2591 at @xmath150  was attributed by @xcite to the evaporation of ice mantles close to the star , which decreases the @xmath150  optical depth by 30% @xcite .",
    "similar effects play a role for the sources presented here , as illustrated for w  33a in the figure . the emission at @xmath151  is not expected to be well reproduced in these models , since the high optical depth makes it very sensitive to deviations from the assumed spherical shape .",
    "the fact that all sources require less extinction at short wavelengths is discussed quantitatively in   [ sec : struc ] .",
    "this point is illustrated by the fact that the column densities derived in this paper are much higher than those found by @xcite by fitting the near- to far - infrared spectra of a sample of ultracompact regions , which have similar submillimeter flux densities and lie at similar distances .",
    "the calculated temperatures follow an @xmath152 profile at distances greater than @xmath153  au from the star , with the absolute temperature scale set by the luminosity . inside this radius ,",
    "the envelope is optically thick to the photons carrying most of the energy , and the temperature gradient is steeper than @xmath152 , with the absolute scale set by the extinction , which acts as a blanket .",

    "however , it is seen from figure  [ f : dusto ] that even the models with @xmath154 fail to fit the near - infrared part of the spectrum .",
    "this is not due to our selection on brightness in the mid - infrared since the data of the comparison samples are not matched either .",

    "the hot cores and the ultracompact region have the highest cs abundances : @xmath18 . the low cs abundance in gl  7009s , @xmath169 ,",

    "figure  [ fig : dust_prof ] demonstrates that the dust and gas tracers agree very well on the best value of @xmath141 , implying that the volume density and column density distributions are consistent .",
    "this result indicates that the dust and gas are well - mixed and that the structure of the envelopes is fairly homogeneous and not very clumpy .",

    "although an inhomogeneous ( clumpy ) structure would cause a discrepancy in this direction , it is hard to see why only one of our sources would have such a structure .",

    "so s  140 is unique in our sample in that it is the only source where our assumption of one central heating source breaks down .",
    "although the data on gl  2591 are well matched by the power law on average , the slope of the data is shallower inside a radius of @xmath179 , and drop more steeply outside this radius .",

    "since the effect is more pronounced towards shorter wavelengths , a variation of the temperature gradient with radius seems more plausible .",

    "the excitation of the quiescent ( non - outflowing ) gas rules out single - temperature models , but the data are well fitted by a model with two discrete temperatures . the column density ratio of these `` cold '' and `` hot '' components varies from  @xmath6 to @xmath185 .",
    "the physical origin of such a two - temperature structure is not clear , however .",
    "we have calculated the column densities in each rotational state of  up to @xmath186 from our power - law models , and the results are compared to the data of mitchell et al .  in figure",

    "together with the evidence from the cs emission line profiles and the near - infrared continuum emission , we estimate the deviations from spherical geometry as a decrease in optical depth by a factor of @xmath13 over an @xmath112 area .    the assumption of a homogeneous density structure is tested in figure  [ fig : mvir ] , where  is compared to the mass derived from the virial theorem inside the same radius .",
    "the latter method assumes that the cloud s gravitation just balances its pressure as measured by the line width @xmath188 ( table  [ vlsr.tab ] ) . if the gas is clumpy , the virial mass is smaller than the power law mass by a fraction @xmath189 , with the volume filling factor @xmath190 .",

    "it is however outside the scope of this paper to investigate a possible evolutionary connection between molecular cloud clumps and the envelopes of massive young stars .",
    "our assumed values of the gas to dust mass ratio and the dust opacity at submillimeter wavelengths were tested by modeling c@xmath0o @xmath193 and @xmath194 observations .",
    "the best - fit values for the abundance of co are listed in column  6 of table  [ t : m_gas ] .",
    "the derived abundances are @xmath195% of the value of @xmath196 measured by @xcite towards the warm cloud ngc  2024 .",
    "our co/  value for gl  2591 is in good agreement with the value of @xmath197 measured by c.  kulesa ( 1999 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , while in the case of gl  490 , our value is a factor of  7 lower .",
    "the co abundance measured in emission is expected to be lower than in absorption , because the emission data are more sensitive to extended cold gas . when measured in infrared absorption , which samples warm material close to the star , the column density ratio of solid to gaseous co never exceeds unity towards massive young stars @xcite .",
    "although source - to - source variations in grain opacity can not be ruled out , a more likely explanation of the spread in co abundances is that different amounts of co are frozen out on grain surfaces .",
    "this occurs at temperatures @xmath198  k in the case of pure co @xcite , and up to @xmath199  k for co-  mixtures . in both cases ,",
    "a correlation of the abundance with temperature is expected .",
    "figure  [ fig : coh2 ] shows a plot of the co abundance derived from c@xmath0o observations versus the mass - weighted temperature , defined as @xmath200 ( see table  [ t : m_gas ] ) .",
    "the two quantities are seen to be correlated , which we interpret as the effect of depletion of co at low temperatures .",
    "these results strongly suggest that depletion and thermal desorption are the processes controlling the abundance of co in the gas phase , after chemical reactions lock up almost all of the available carbon .",
    "this situation is in contrast with that of cs , for which the abundance shows no clear trend with @xmath201 .",
    "this difference presumably reflects the much greater chemical inertness of co compared to cs , and the lower evaporation temperature of co compared with cs .    in the case of gl  7009s ,",
    "the  column density observed in absorption by @xcite is similar to that in our model .",
    "this implies that along this line of sight , co is much less depleted than cs , for which a depletion by a factor @xmath202 was found compared to the other sources in our sample ( section  [ s : mod_gas ] ) .",
    "again , this can be understood from the difference in evaporation temperature for these two molecules .",
    "the large column of co ice towards , e.g. , w  3  irs5 , is not predicted by our model .",
    "we suggest that this star - forming core is surrounded by an extended dense cloud which also produces the self - reversed co emission profiles .",
    "sources like gl  2591 and gl  2136 do not seem to have such a `` skin '' , or they have at most a translucent one .",
    "@xcite found that the submillimeter opacity of dust grains increases by @xmath203% when the temperature rises from 24  to 300  k. this effect would decrease the masses of our sources and increase the inferred abundances of co , and qualitatively produce the same trend as seen in figure  [ fig : coh2 ] .",
    "however , over the applicable temperature range , @xmath204  k , an effect of only @xmath205% should occur , which is much less than the factor of  3 increase in co abundance that we find .",
    "although the grain opacity is likely to vary within our sources , they do not influence the conclusion that the co abundance is controlled by freezing and sublimation .      in this section ,",
    "the envelope models derived in   [ s : models ] will be compared to the ovro continuum data . since the images presented in figure  [ fig : ovromaps ] show only compact , circularly symmetric structure , a simple one - dimensional analysis in the fourier plane is sufficient .",
    "the points in figure  [ fig : cvis ] are the ovro data , averaged in annuli around the source in the _ uv _ plane . in the case of",
    "w  33a , the source mm2 was subtracted from the data before averaging .",
    "the error bars represent the @xmath207 spread between the data points in each bin , and do not include the overall calibration error . superposed on the data points",
    "are model curves , derived by calculating the dust emission from the best - fit models ( table  [ t : m_gas ] ) and fourier transforming the result .    only at the lowest spatial frequencies ,",
    "the data match the model curves within the calibration error .",
    "most data points lie well above the model curves , and the observed amplitudes do not drop with increasing spatial frequency , as the models do .",
    "these differences suggest that the emission detected with ovro is not related to the envelopes seen in the single - dish data , but due to compact structure of size @xmath208 .",
    "the same conclusion was reached for gl  2591 by @xcite .    towards the highest",
    "observed spatial frequencies , @xmath209  rad@xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath210  au at 1  kpc , the compact emission is @xmath23 times stronger than that of the envelope model .",
    "this factor is a lower limit to the column density contrast between the two components , since the compact emission is probably optically thick , as indicated by the spectral indices .",
    "combined with the envelope column densities in table  [ vlsr.tab ] , this result suggests that the compact emission seen with ovro can explain the asymmetry observed in the cs line profiles (   [ s : res : spectra ] ) .",
    "further constraints on the nature of the compact emission can be obtained from the flux densities ( table  [ posflux.tab ] ) , which imply brightness temperatures of @xmath211  k for ngc  7538  irs1 and @xmath6  k for the other sources .",
    "these values imply that the emission is beam diluted by a factor of @xmath212 , since the physical temperature of the compact structure must be at least that of the surrounding envelope , which acts as an oven ( see @xcite ) . assuming a temperature of @xmath213  k for the compact dust , a lower limit to the mass of @xmath214",
    "is obtained . in the case of ngc  7538  irs1 , where free - free and dust emission both contribute at these frequencies",
    "@xcite , the physical temperature may be @xmath35  k , and the beam dilution correspondingly more . for the other sources ,",
    "the compact emission is most likely due to dust , perhaps in the form of a dense shell or of a circumstellar disk .",
    "the implied radius of the emitting region , @xmath215  au at @xmath216  kpc , seems small to hide an entire outflow lobe , but presumably , the dense part of the flow which emits in high-@xmath110 cs lines is confined to its center .",
    "this section discusses possible origins of the spread in @xmath141 within our sample .",
    "first , the value of @xmath141 may be related to other physical parameters , in particular luminosity or envelope mass .",
    "the structure of the material surrounding pre - main sequence stars of low ( @xmath41  solar ) and intermediate ( @xmath217  solar ) mass has received considerable attention in the recent literature : e.g. @xcite .",
    "these studies generally find @xmath218 inside radii of 0.1  pc , masses of @xmath21910  and mean densities of @xmath220  .",
    "of these properties , only the radii are similar to those of the objects studied here ; the masses and mean densities are at least two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the density gradients are significantly steeper than found in this paper , but the gradients for intermediate - mass stars are also lower than those for low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "indeed , in an earlier study of regions of high - mass star formation , @xcite suggested that more massive star - forming regions tend to have flatter density distributions .",
    "however , figs .  [",
    "fig : alpha]a and  b show that within our sample , @xmath141 does not appear correlated with source luminosity or envelope mass . we did not find a relation with any other physical parameters either , such as turbulent pressure as measured by the line width .",
    "power laws have been proposed for the density structures of the envelopes of young stars , with the index depending on the dominant term in the pressure .",
    "if support against gravitational collapse is primarily due to thermal pressure , a value of @xmath12 is expected , while if the dominant pressure is of nonthermal origin , the density structure should follow an @xmath221 law . in between these two cases ,",
    "a continuum of solutions can be constructed @xcite .",
    "our observations may thus indicate that the cores where massive stars form differ from those where low - mass stars form in that they are supported against collapse by a different mechanism . within this interpretation",
    ", the spread in @xmath141 may be due to source evolution from an ( @xmath29 ) logatrope to a collapsing region ( @xmath30 ) .      despite having similar radio and infrared properties",
    "our sources show different degrees of dispersal and warming - up of their envelopes .",
    "this is shown by @xcite and @xcite for a source sample similar to ours based on several tracers : the far - infrared color , the fraction of crystalline co@xmath19 ice , the gas / solid ratios of co , co@xmath19 and h@xmath19o , and the excitation temperature of co. these quantities all trace the envelope temperature , but all in a different way : some trace the dust , others the gas , and some trace small scales and others large scales . as shown by boogert et al . , the temperature indicators correlate with each other .",
    "of particular interest is the fraction of crystalline co@xmath19 ice , because crystallization is an irreversible process , so that this indicator measures the maximum temperature , while the others measure the current temperature .",
    "hence , the temperature variations are not random fluctuations ( like in fu  orionis objects ) , but reflect a systematic increase with time of the temperature of the envelope as a whole .    figure  [ fig : evol]a plots one of these indicators , the far - infrared color , versus the ratio of  to stellar mass , measured as @xmath222 .",
    "this quantity is equivalent to the ratio of submillimeter to bolometric luminosity , often used to trace the evolution of young low - mass objects @xcite .",
    "the color @xmath223 is the ratio of the flux densities at @xmath224  and @xmath25  , both observed with iso - lws in an @xmath225  beam , which is large enough to cover the entire envelope .",
    "these data were provided by a.  boogert ( 1999 , priv .",
    "the plotted quantities are seen to be correlated , with higher temperatures ( traced by a larger @xmath223 ) corresponding to lower values of @xmath226 .",
    "thus , the temperature variations are indeed due to dispersal of the circumstellar material and can be used to trace evolution .",
    "interestingly , @xmath141 is not seen to be correlated with far - infrared color ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]b ) , and we conclude that on the time scale of the dispersal of the envelopes of massive young stars , the density structure of the envelopes does not change significantly .",
    "the masses of the compact sources detected by us and by @xcite and @xcite do not show a relation with /@xmath222 either , although the uncertainty in these masses is rather high .",
    "in addition to @xmath226 , we have considered two `` derivative '' evolutionary indicators .",
    "the first is the bolometric temperature , introduced for low - mass objects by @xcite . as the envelopes in those systems are dispersed ( probably by the bipolar outflows ) , their bolometric temperatures rise because the far - infrared emission decreases while the near - infrared emission increases @xcite .",
    "this process makes  increase monotonically from @xmath227  k to @xmath228  k on a time scale of @xmath229  yr . for all but two of our objects , values of  based on the spectral energy distributions of fig .",
    "[ f : dusto ] , are @xmath230  k. this small spread suggests that all the sources are at similar evolutionary stages ;  may also work less well than @xmath223 because near- and mid - infrared emission have a dependence on source orientation .",
    "another potential evolutionary indicator is the radio continuum flux , which for a given luminosity and distance is expected to increase with time as the dusty envelope is cleared away and the lyman continuum photons can all go into ionizing the gas without being absorbed by dust .",
    "we have normalized the radio continuum flux densities in table  [ sam.tab ] to the value expected for an h  ii region ionized by a main sequence star of the same luminosity and at the same distance as the source , following @xcite .",
    "however , figs .",
    "[ fig : evol]c and  d show that neither the radio continuum emission nor the bolometric temperature correlates well with /@xmath222 , suggesting these are less useful evolutionary indicators for very young massive objects than @xmath223 .",
    "possibly the radio emission arises in a wind (   [ s : samp ] ) , or the stellar surface temperatures are significantly below main sequence values .",
    "we conclude that dispersal of the envelopes underlies the evolution of both high - mass and low - mass objects , but that the observational appearance is very different .",
    "the dispersal process can be understood in more detail by recalling that the brightest mid - infrared sources in our sample are the weakest at radio wavelengths and vice versa ( table  [ sam.tab ] ) .",
    "this anticorrelation suggests that the erosion of the envelope proceeds from the inside out .",
    "massive stars are efficient at removing circumstellar dust by their ionizing uv radiation and by their strong winds . when the innermost , hottest region of dust disappears , the mid - infrared emission will decrease , but the radio continuum will increase because a larger region can be ionized .",
    "the compact dust component detected with ovro is optically thick in the bright mid - infrared sources but thin in the others , which trend may also trace dispersal of hot dust .",
    "the far - infrared emission will not be affected since it arises on larger scales .",
    "these trends are consistent with the properties of our sample , although other processes may play a role as well .",
    "we have presented maps and spectra of 14 regions of massive star formation in continuum and molecular lines at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the data are used to develop models of the physical structure of the circumstellar envelopes on @xmath2  au scales .",
    "the column density is derived from the submillimeter continuum flux densities , and the temperature structure is calculated self - consistently using the size of the cs emission and the sources luminosities and distances from the literature .",
    "the density structure is constrained with emission lines of cs ,  and .",
    "the following main conclusions are found :    \\1 .",
    "the physical structure of the envelopes of deeply embedded massive young stars is characterized by radii of @xmath231  au , masses of @xmath232  inside these radii and visual extinctions of @xmath233  magnitudes .",
    "temperatures increase from @xmath234  k at the outer edge to several @xmath25  k at @xmath235  au from the star ; densities increase from @xmath236  to @xmath237  .",
    "the slope of the density gradient @xmath141 is @xmath238 , significantly smaller than the value of @xmath239 usually found for low - mass objects .",
    "this difference in density structure may be due to nonthermal pressure resisting gravitational collapse , while thermal pressure dominates in lower - mass objects .",
    "an @xmath12 density structure is found here for two hot cores , but this is an upper limit since the cs abundance may be enhanced in the warm gas close to the star .",
    "the shapes of the envelopes deviate somewhat from spherical , as shown by modeling infrared absorption line data of , the near - infrared continuum and the cs line profiles",
    ". the data are consistent with a decrease of the optical depth by a factor of @xmath13 in the central @xmath112 area .",
    "the brightness of our main sample at mid - infrared wavelengths is partly due to this optical depth effect , but also to the flatter density structure .",
    "inhomogeneities on top of the power law structure are small , since the masses obtained by integrating the power law models agree with masses found from the virial theorem to a factor of  3 .",
    "the values of @xmath141 found from cs are verified by model fits to the maps of dust emission which trace the column density distribution .",
    "the only exception is s  140  irs1 , probably because our assumption of a single central heating source is invalid in this case .",
    "modeling of c@xmath0o emission lines shows that @xmath240% of the co gas is depleted onto dust , assuming a dust opacity of @xmath6  g@xmath7 at @xmath5 , as found previously for one of our sources , gl  2591 @xcite .",
    "the derived co abundances correlate well with the mass - weighted temperature in our models .",
    "this result suggests that in these sources , freeze - out and thermal desorption control the gas - phase abundance of co. the cs abundance is @xmath16 on average , ranging from @xmath169 in the cold source gl  7009s to @xmath241 in the `` hot core''-type objects .",
    "dense outflowing gas is seen in the cs and h@xmath19co line wings , but much more so at blue- than at redshifted velocities .",
    "this asymmetry may be due to absorption by dense , optically thick material within 10@xmath20 from the star .",
    "the opacity of the power law models is a factor of @xmath23 below that required for this absorption .",
    "however , interferometric continuum observations at @xmath21  show compact emission , probably from an @xmath22 diameter optically thick dust component .",
    "the emission is a factor of @xmath242 stronger than expected for the envelopes seen in the single - dish data , and may be due to a dense shell or a circumstellar disk .",
    "this component may explain the asymmetric cs and  line profiles .",
    "the evolution of these high - mass sources is traced by the overall temperature ( measured by the far - infrared color ) , which increases systematically with decreasing ratio of envelope mass to stellar mass .",
    "the observed anticorrelation of near - infrared and radio continuum emission suggests that the disruption of the envelope proceeds from the inside out .",
    "conventional tracers of the evolution of low - mass objects do not change much over this narrow age range .",
    "we conclude that the evolution of high - mass and low - mass envelopes have the same underlying mechanism ( envelope dispersal ) , despite their different observational properties .",
