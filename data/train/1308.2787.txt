    "cloud based infrastructure has proven to be very effective in providing on - demand computational resources to both commercial applications and a wide range of large - scale scientific applications .",
    "applications in climate simulation and analysis @xcite , biomedical image processing @xcite , satellite data processing @xcite , astronomy @xcite , and disaster response systems @xcite have all been successfully supported using cloud infrastructure .",
    "such successes in both the commercial and scientific settings have depended on bringing to bear the talents of computer scientists and expert developers in order to efficiently exploit cloud - based infrastructure .    in this paper",
    ", we explore how a different class of users with a different kind of workload might be able to take advantage of the cloud .",
    "in particular , we study how analysts , who are domain experts with quantitative / mathematical skills , but often with software skills limited to high - level programming environments like r @xcite , matlab @xcite or octave @xcite , might be supported in harnessing the cloud for ad hoc analytical workloads .",
    "analytical workloads abound in application domains ranging from computational finance and risk analytics to engineering and manufacturing settings . in our experience , these workloads which often involve simulation @xcite and optimisation @xcite tasks share common features as follows :    1 .",
    "the associated codes are developed by analysts , not professional developers , in high - level programming environments such as r or matlab .",
    "these codes and the related input data are generally created by analysts for either one time use or are heavily modified each time they are used to adapt them to the analytical question at hand .",
    "3 .   the codes are often computationally intensive or require a large number of independent runs with varying input parameters making some form of parallelism attractive .",
    "cloud computing is a potential solution that can be beneficial not only to meet the computational requirements of analytical workloads @xcite but also to achieve speed - up @xcite .",
    "a wide range of analytical workloads are already harnessing the benefits of cloud computing .",
    "for example , analytical workloads related to data processing @xcite , online games @xcite , climate @xcite , medical records @xcite , risk @xcite , social networks @xcite and neuroscience @xcite .",
    "our goal has been to develop a platform that allows analysts to take an analytical job ( both the code and associated data ) that runs on their personal workstations and with minimum effort and minimum change to the code have them run on large - scale parallel cloud infrastructure .",
    "if this can be facilitated gracefully , the analyst can solve larger problems or perform more experiments in less time .",
    "our approach is somewhat different from other ` cluster on cloud ' projects such as @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite in that our focus is to simplify an analyst s use of cloud infrastructure , rather than provide a fully - configurable high - performance computing cluster on clouds for developers . in particular , we have explored a platform for facilitating r - based risk analytics on the amazon ec2 cloud .",
    "however , we believe that the basic platform and the experienced gained can be generalised to a wider class of analytics and cloud - based infrastructure .",
    "the * * p**latform for * * p**arallel * r*-based * * a**nalytics on * * c**loud infrastructure ( p2rac ) has been designed to harness on - demand compute and storage resources available on the cloud for analytical workloads , and at the same time simplify an analyst s use of the cloud infrastructure .",
    "it provides an interface / api for analysts to ( i ) set - up both individual machines and clusters of machines in the cloud , ( ii ) associate with machines both persistent and short term storage , ( iii ) transfer both code and data , ( iv ) execute both batch and interactive jobs , and ( v ) manage execution and resource termination .",
    "the goal is to allow analysts to submit jobs to the cloud with minimum effort , and manage both the resources and the data required to solve a problem and execute it on the cloud .",
    "the current implementation of p2rac provides support for the resources available on the amazon aws infrastructure and offers a set of both core and diagnostic tools , and could also be implemented on other cloud platforms .    in our interaction with analysts working in industry",
    "we have observed a number of commonly arising work patterns . in each of these analysts",
    "start by prototyping an analytical code on their personal workstations , and then as they progress in their work may require additional computing resources .",
    "additional resources are required ( i ) to perform production runs on a single workstation with more memory or compute speed , ( ii ) to perform a parameter sweep in which the same code is run hundreds or thousands of times with different input parameters , or ( iii ) to speed - up a single long running optimisation or simulation task by exploiting co - operative parallelism that may be built into the optimisation or simulation library being used .",
    "p2rac has been designed to address each of these cases . in the later two cases it is important to balance easy - of - use with parallel speed - up .",
    "the experimental section of this paper explores this trade - off and shows that reasonable speed - up can often be obtained on cloud infrastructure without undue complexity .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ platform ] presents the software structure , the sequence of steps that need to be initiated to execute an analytical task on the cloud , and two example workflows for using p2rac when compute resources , such as instances and clusters are employed .",
    "section [ implementation ] presents the implementation of p2rac and the set of commands offered by the platform .",
    "section [ experimentalstudies ] describes two analytical problems that are executed on the cloud using p2rac and the results obtained from the experiments .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , we discuss the software structure of * * p**latform for * * p**arallel * r*-based * * a**nalytics on * * c**loud infrastructure ( p2rac ) , and its usage .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] illustrates how the platform fits in coherently between an analyst , who is the typical user , and the cloud infrastructure .",
    "the analyst s project comprising r scripts and large data files is passed on to p2rac as a task for execution on the cloud .",
    "the platform then gathers and initialises a pool of computational and storage resources on the cloud for executing the task .",
    "the platform subsequently transfers the task onto the resources and manages task execution .",
    "after the task is executed , the platform gathers results which may be spread across the resources in the cloud .",
    "the platform provides support both for an individual computing resource as well as for clusters ( a collection of computing resources that work collaboratively ) .",
    "the platform comprises three components , ( a ) the core tools , ( b ) the diagnostic tools and ( c ) the configuration files .",
    "the core tools provide functionalities for resource management , data management and execution management .",
    "the diagnostic tools provide functionalities for checking the computational environment .",
    "the configuration files provide support for the functionalities of the core and diagnostic tools .",
    "a sequence of five steps need to be initiated on an analyst site to execute a job on the cloud . in the first step ,",
    "computing and storage resources are initialised on the cloud . in the second step",
    ", the analytical project is sent to the resources . in the third step ,",
    "the scripts within the project are executed on the resources . in the fourth step ,",
    "results which are generated on the resources are gathered onto the analyst site . in the fifth step ,",
    "all resources initialised on the cloud are released .",
    "the illustration of the above five steps using the command - line tools of p2rac is shown as two workflows , the first for executing a task on an instance and the second for executing a task on a cluster . for running an r - script on an instance ,",
    "the sequence of commands are shown in figure [ figure2a ] .",
    "an analyst in possession of r scripts utilising snow library firstly creates an instance ( corresponds to the first step ) on the amazon cloud .",
    "the scripts and the data required by the script are then provided to the instance ( corresponds to the second step ) .",
    "the script is executed on the instance and produces the results on the instance ( corresponds to the third step ) .",
    "the results can then be fetched by the analyst ( corresponds to the fourth step ) .",
    "multiple tasks can be executed and their results generated and retrieved from the same instance .",
    "finally , the instance is terminated ( corresponds to the fifth step ) .",
    "figure [ figure2b ] shows the sequence of the commands and the order in which they are executed at the analyst site for executing a task on the cluster .",
    "a cluster with 4 instances ( 1 master and 3 worker instances ) is created ( corresponds to the first step ) .",
    "the analyst secondly sends the r scripts and the data required by the scripts to the cluster ( corresponds to the second step ) .",
    "the script is then executed and the result of execution is generated on the master instance ( corresponds to the third step ) . when the execution of the r scripts are completed",
    "then the analyst gathers the results to his site ( corresponds to the fourth step ) .",
    "multiple tasks can be executed on the same cluster , and the results generated can be retrieved from the cluster .",
    "the cluster is finally terminated ( corresponds to the fifth step ) .",
    "this section considers firstly , how amazon web service ( aws ) is supported on p2rac , and secondly , the tools offered by p2rac .",
    "the tools of p2rac are separated out as ( i ) the core tools , ( ii ) the diagnostic tools and ( iii ) the configuration files supporting both instances and clusters .",
    "this section considers the implementation of the tools that support the cluster and instance .",
    "the core and diagnostic tools are implemented as commands which are executed from the command - line .",
    "the resources provided by a cloud are accessible through infrastructure as a service ( iaas ) @xcite , and amazon is a leading provider of iaas .",
    "the computational resources on amazon are referred to as elastic compute cloud ( ec2 ) and are available as instances .",
    "these resources are available on - demand and are paid for on the basis of their usage .",
    "the amazon instances are initialized using amazon machine images ( ami ) @xcite .",
    "two ubuntu amis are used in this research .",
    "the first ami , supports cluster compute instances offered by amazon .",
    "the cluster compute instances are built on hardware virtual machine ( hvm ) type virtualisation .",
    "the second ubuntu ami offers support for non - hvm type virtualisation .",
    "any additional libraries which an analyst needs to include in his project can be installed on the instance by specifying library packages in a configuration file .",
    "the storage resources on amazon are referred to as the elastic block storage ( ebs ) @xcite .",
    "similar to ec2 , ebs is available on - demand and are paid for on the basis of data transfer and volume of storage .",
    "one note worthy feature of ebs includes its ability to provide persistent data storage .",
    "this feature is exploited when large volumes of data need to be used in an analyst s project and thereby eliminates the need for frequent transfer of data that may not be changed over time .",
    "another feature of ebs is that it can be attached ( mounted ) as a local storage onto an ec2 instance in addition to its storage .",
    "this feature eliminates the need for making data locally available to the instance .    the ec2 and ebs services are employed by p2rac .",
    "the p2rac platform mediates between an analyst s project and the web services offered by amazon .",
    "the platform is built with the python programming language and draws heavily on two libraries .",
    "firstly , the boto library , which provides p2rac a python interface to the amazon web services . secondly , the fabric library , which facilitates remote administration of the instances on the cloud for p2rac .",
    "the core tools of p2rac provide functionalities for resource management , data management on the resource , and execution management of a task on the resource .",
    "an interface is provided to an analyst to access the cloud which allows significant computational resources to be brought to bear while greatly reducing the complexities associated with directly working with the cloud infrastructure .",
    "this is necessary since an analyst is less likely to have knowledge and experience of working with computational clouds .",
    "is offered using tools for instance management , data management on the instance and execution management of a task on the instance .",
    "* _ instance management _ * tools configure an instance on the cloud , offers the instance for the execution of a task and finally terminates the instance after the task it was executing is completed .",
    "p2rac offers two tools for managing instances , namely ` ec2createinstance ` and ` ec2terminateinstance ` .",
    "the ` ec2createinstance ` command is responsible for configuring an instance on the cloud and making it available to an analyst .",

    "if a catastrophe occurs that meets the conditions described when the bond is issued ( referred to as trigger ) , then the principal would be forgiven and the sponsoring insurance company would use this money to pay claim - holders .    when a cat bond is issued with a parametric trigger , then the investors are made available with ( a ) regions and perils exposed and the sponsor s share in those region - perils , and ( b ) the probability of attachment and expected loss .",

    "is employed .",
    "the dimension of the optimisation space is typically 2000 - 4000 region - perils combinations and there are a number of non - linear constraints that must be applied thereby making the catopt problem a challenging and computationally intensive problem .",
    "the catopt r script is structured as a distributed genetic algorithm using the rgenoud @xcite r package which combines evolutionary search algorithms with derivative - based ( newton or quasi - newton ) methods .",

    "the reduction in parallel efficiency is due to increase in communication overheads between virtualised cloud instances .",
    "the acceleration achieved for both the problems is satisfactory considering the low cost of the infrastructure employed and that the problems can be directly deployed from an analyst s site without any additional tuning .",

    "there is an increase in the time taken for creating amazon instances and clusters .",
    "though the creation of resources occur in parallel , nearly 7 minutes are required to initialise a 8 node m2.2xlarge cluster and approximately 8 minutes are required to initialise a 16 node m2.2xlarge cluster .",

    "however , there is an increase in both the times for submitting a job and for retrieving results when all the nodes of the cluster are considered . though the submission of the job and the retrieval of results are parallel in nature there is an increase in time , eliciting the need for investigating other parallel methods that can reduce this time . for large jobs like catopt that need to run for",

    "these frameworks are useful for developers who have advanced knowledge of the technicalities of the cloud , and can adapt their analytical workloads for such frameworks .",
    "ad hoc analytics will not be easy on such tools as they are mostly performed by analysts who have limited technical skills , and therefore their prototyping requires a simpler framework .",
    "frameworks such as cloudblast @xcite and cloudburst @xcite support easy workflows without having to specifically adapt analytical workloads for the cloud , but are aimed at computational biological applications and thereby limit their use for analysts .",
    "frameworks such as cloudfoundry @xcite and starcluster @xcite do not provide explicit support for r programming language and therefore a lot of manual procedures are required to run an analyst s workload .",
    "such frameworks do not provide seamless execution of a task on the cloud .    in this paper , a platform that ( i ) provides an analyst with an interface to seamlessly submit an analytical job and collect its results , and ( ii ) provides the flexibility to manage the resources and jobs is ideal for an analyst who needs to exploit the benefits of the cloud .",
    "analytical jobs can benefit from harnessing the benefits of cloud computing such as on - demand availability of resources , scalability of the resources and low costs for maintenance .",
    "the platform for parallel r - based analytics on the cloud ( p2rac ) proposed and implemented in this paper provides an interface for an analyst who needs to submit a r - based analytical job on the cloud .",
    "p2rac is therefore placed in between an analyst and the cloud infrastructure .",
    "p2rac provides support for instances and clusters on the amazon cloud and offers a set of core and diagnostic tools which can be used from the command - line .",
    "the core tools support resource management , data management on the resource and execution management .",
    "resource management functionalities range from gathering resources required for an analytical job and releasing them after their use .",
    "data management ranges from providing the resources with data required for executing an r - script and gathering results from the resources onto the analyst s site once the r - script has completed execution .",
    "execution management provides functionalities for executing an r - script on the resources acquired .",
    "the diagnostic tools support the testing of resources and provide information of the resources employed by an analyst .",
    "this is facilitated by providing access to log in to the acquired resources .",
    "the feasibility of p2rac is validated by considering two analytical problems .",
    "the algorithm for solving the first problem incorporates co - operative parallelism for optimisation , while in the second problem , multiple independent jobs are employed for parameter sweep .",
    "both the problems are provided from an analyst work site to the amazon cloud using p2rac .",
    "the results obtained from p2rac is an evidence that r - based analytical problems can benefit from cloud computing and p2rac facilitates the execution of the analyst job on the cloud .    the installation package and the source code for p2rac is hosted via the python package index ( pypi ) http://pypi.python.org/pypi .",
    "the installation is built for the linux os , supports virtual python environment @xcite and can be installed on a desktop using easy install @xcite .",
    "after installation , p2rac can be configured automatically using ` ec2configurep2rac ` .    in the future",
    ", it is anticipated that another version of p2rac will be released that incorporates the support for spot instances .",
    "fault tolerance through distributed checkpointing for spot instance used in p2rac will be explored .",
    "further , the dynamic scaling of clusters , i.e. , increase and decrease the size of a cluster when required by a job that is executing on the cluster , will be investigated for implementation . while packages such as those reported in @xcite support explicit parallelism , efforts will be made to provide a dedicated interface that can exploit amazon ec2 for r programming .",
