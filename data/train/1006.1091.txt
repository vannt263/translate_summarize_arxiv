    "since the relativistic and higher - order @xmath4 corrections are less important for bottomonia than for any other @xmath5 systems , study on bottomonia may offer more direct information about the hadron configuration and application of the perturbative qcd .",
    "the key problem is how to deal with the hadronic transition matrix elements which are fully governed by the non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "many phenomenological models have been constructed and applied .",
    "each of them has achieved relative successes , but since none of them are based on any well established underlying theories , their model parameters must be obtained by fitting data . by doing so , some drawbacks of the model are exposed when applying to deal with different phenomenological processes .",
    "thus one needs to continuously modify the model or re - fit its parameter , if not completely negate it .",
    "the light front quark model is one of such models .",
    "it has been applied to calculate the hadronic transitions and generally considered as a successful one .",
    "the model contains a gaussian - type wavefunction whose parameters should be determined in a certain way .",
    "the gaussian - type wavefunction was recommended by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite and most frequently the wavefunction for harmonic oscillator is adopted which we refer as the traditional lfqm wavefunction . as we employed the traditional lfqm wave functions to calculate the branching ratios of @xmath6",
    ", some obvious contradictions between the theoretical predictions and experimental data emerged .",
    "namely , the predicted @xmath7 was one order larger than the experimental upper bound @xcite . moreover ,",
    "as one carefully investigates the wave functions , he would face a serious problem .",
    "if the traditional wave functions were employed , the decay constants of @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) would increase for higher @xmath9 .",
    "it obviously contradicts to the experimental data and the physics picture which tells us that the decay constant of a @xmath1 state is proportional to its wavefunction at origin which manifests the probability that the two constituents spatially merge , so for excited states the probability should decrease .",
    "thus the decay constants should be smaller as @xmath9 is larger .",
    "the experimental data confirm this trend .",
    "but the theoretical calculations with the traditional wave functions result in an inverse order . to overcome these problems ,",
    "one may adopt different model parameters ( refers to @xmath10 ) by fitting individual @xmath9 s decay constants as done in @xcite , but the orthogonality among the @xmath1 states is broken . in this work ,",
    "we try to modify the harmonic oscillator functions and introduce an explicit @xmath9-dependent form for the wave functions . keeping the orthogonality among the @xmath1 states ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "we modify the lfqm wave functions . by fitting the decay constants of @xmath0 ,",
    "the concerned model parameters are fixed .",
    "besides fitting the decay constants of the @xmath0 family , one should test the applicability of the model in other processes .",
    "we choose the radiative decays of @xmath12 as the probe . as a matter of fact ,",
    "those radiative decays are of great significance for understanding the hadronic structure of bottomonia family .    indeed , the spin - triplet state of bottomonia @xmath0 and the p - states @xmath13 were discovered decades ago , however the singlet state @xmath14 evaded detection for a long time , even though much efforts were made .",
    "many phenomenological researches on @xmath14 have been done by some groups @xcite .",
    "different theoretical approaches result in different level splitting @xmath15 . in @xcite",
    "the authors used an improved perturbative qcd approach to get @xmath16 mev ; using the potential model suggested in @xcite eichten and quigg estimated @xmath17 mev @xcite ; in ref . @xcite the authors selected a non - relativistic hamiltonian with spin dependent corrections to study the spectra of heavy quarkonia and got @xmath18=57 mev ; the lattice prediction is @xmath19=51 mev @xcite , whereas the lattice result calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite was @xmath20mev .",
    "ebert @xmath21 @xcite directly studied spectra of heavy quarkonia in the relativistic quark model and gave @xmath22 gev .",
    "the dispersion of the values may imply that there exist some ambiguities in our understanding about the structures of the @xmath23 family .",
    "c    the babar collaboration @xcite first measured @xmath24 , and determined @xmath25 mev , @xmath26 mev in 2008 .",
    "new data @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 were released in 2009 @xcite .",
    "more recently the cleo collaboration @xcite confirmed the observation of @xmath14 using the database of 6 million @xmath29 decays and assuming @xmath3010 mev , they obtained @xmath31 , @xmath32 mev and the hyperfine splitting @xmath33 mev , whereas using the database with 9 million @xmath34 decays they obtained @xmath35 at 90% confidential level .",
    "it is noted that the data of the two collaborations are in accordance on @xmath36 , but the central values of @xmath37 are different .",
    "however , if the experimental errors are taken into account , the difference is within one standard deviation .",
    "some theoretical works @xcite are devoted to account the experimental results . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors studied these radiative decays and estimated @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with the mass @xmath36 = @xmath41 gev .",
    "their results about @xmath36 and @xmath42 are close to the data .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite systematically investigated the magnetic dipole transition @xmath43 in the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) @xcite . in the qcd - motivated approach",
    "there are several free parameters , i.e. , the quark mass and @xmath10 in the wave function ( the notation of @xmath10 was given in the aforementioned literatures ) which are fixed by the variational principle , then @xmath44 was calculated and the central value is @xmath45 . it is also noted that the mass of @xmath46 gev presented in ref .",
    "@xcite deviates from the data listed before , so we are going to re - fix the parameter @xmath10 in other ways namely we fix the parameter @xmath10 by fitting data .    since experimentally",
    ", @xmath36 is determined by @xmath47 and a study on the radiative decays can offer us much information about the characteristics of @xmath14 , one should carefully investigate the transition within a relatively reliable theoretical framework .",
    "that is the aim of the present work , namely we will evaluate the hadronic matrix element in terms of our modified lfqm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , in section ii we discuss how to modify the traditional wave functions in lfqm .",
    "we present the formula to calculate the form factors for @xmath43 in the lfqm and numerical results in section iii .",
    "the section iv is devoted to our conclusion and discussion .",
    "when the lfqm is employed to calculate the decay constants and form factors , one needs the wave functions of the concerned hadrons . in most cases ,",
    "the wave functions of harmonic oscillator are adopted . in the works",
    "@xcite , only the wave function of the radially ground state is needed , but when in the processes under consideration radially excited states of are involved , their wave functions should also be available . in @xcite , the traditional wave functions @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 states in configuration space from harmonic oscillator",
    "are given as @xmath51 in order to maintain the orthogonality among @xmath1 states , the parameter @xmath10 in the above two functions are the same . the wave functions for other @xmath1 state can be found in appendix a.    the decay constants of the @xmath1 states are directly proportional to the wave function at the origin @xmath52if we simply adopt the wave functions of harmonic oscillator for all of them as we do for the @xmath49 state , then we find the wave functions at the origin , i.e. @xmath53 ( see appendix for details ) rises with increase of @xmath9 ( the principle quantum number ) which means the decay constants would increase for larger @xmath9 . for example , by eq .",
    "( [ eq:12s ] ) the ratio of wave functions of @xmath50 and @xmath49 states at the origin is @xmath54 .",
    "the decay constants @xmath8 of @xmath0 are extracted from the processes @xmath55 with @xmath56 where @xmath57 represents @xmath0 and @xmath58 its mass . by use of the experimental data from pdg @xcite",
    ", we obtain the experimental values for @xmath8 which are listed in table [ tab : decay ] . obviously , the decay constant becomes smaller as @xmath9 is larger .    in lfqm ,",
    "the formula for calculating the vector meson decay constant is given by @xcite @xmath59,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and other notations are collected in the appendix . in the calculation we set @xmath61 gev following @xcite and the decay constant of @xmath62",
    "is used to determine the parameter @xmath63 as the input .",
    "we obtain @xmath640.006 gev corresponding to @xmath65 mev . in order to illustrate the dependence of our results on @xmath66 ,",
    "we re - set @xmath67 gev to repeat our calculation , then by fitting the same data , we fix @xmath680.006 gev and all the results are clearly shown in the following tables .",
    "the @xmath69 in table [ tab : decay ] are the decay constant calculated in the traditional wave functions .",
    "these results expose an explicit contradictory trend .",
    "thus , our calculation indicates that if the traditional wave functions are used , the obtained decay constants of @xmath0 would sharply contradict to the experimental data .    .",
    "the decay constants of @xmath0 ( in the unit of mev ) .",
    "the column ",
    "@xmath69 \" represents the theoretcal predictions with the traditional wave function in lfqm . the column ",
    "@xmath70 \" represents the prediction with our modified wave function and the values in the brackets are the corresponding values with @xmath67 gev as input .",
    "( the other values are corresponding to @xmath61 gev . ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : etab2 ]",
    "the lfqm has been successful in phenomenological applications .",
    "it is believed that it could be a reasonable model for dealing with the hadronic transitions where the non - perturbative qcd effects dominate .",
    "however , it seems that the wave function adopted in the previous literature has to be modified .",
    "as we study the decay constant of @xmath0 , we find that there exists a sharp contradiction between the theoretical prediction and data as long as the traditional harmonic oscillator wave functions were employed .",
    "namely , the larger @xmath9 is , the larger the predicted decay constant would be .",
    "it is obviously contradict to the physics picture that for higher radially excited states , the wave function at origin should be smaller than the lower ones .",
    "but the old wave functions would result in an inverse tendency . if enforcing all the decay constants of @xmath0 to be fitted to the data in terms of the traditional wave functions , the orthogonality among all the @xmath1 states must be abandoned , but it is not acceptable according to the basic principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "thus we modify the wave functions of the radial excited states based on the common principles .",
    "namely , we keep the orthogonality among the wave functions and their proper normalization .",
    "moreover , we require the wave functions @xmath71 at origin @xmath72 to be consistent with the data , i.e. the decay constants for higher @xmath9 must be smaller than that of the lower states .",
    "concretely , we modify the exponential function in the wave functions by demanding the power not to universal for all @xmath9 s , but be dependent on @xmath9 .",
    "concretely we add a numerical factor @xmath73 into @xmath74 and by fitting the data of the decay constants of @xmath0 we obtain a series of the numbers of @xmath73 . within a reasonable error range ,",
    "we approximate @xmath73 as @xmath75 and calculate the value for @xmath76 .",
    "it is an alternative way which is different from that adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , to fix the parameter .    with the modified wave functions of @xmath0",
    ", we calculate the branching ratios of @xmath6 in the lfqm .",
    "first by fitting the well - measured central value of @xmath77 @xcite , we obtain the parameter @xmath78 . by the effective heavy quark theory , in heavy quark limit the spin singlet and triplet of @xmath23 system should degenerate , namely the parameters of @xmath79 and @xmath78 should be very close .",
    "our numerical result confirms this requirement .",
    "then we estimate the other @xmath2 .",
    "the order of magnitudes of our numerical results is consistent with data . even though the predicted branching ratios still do not precisely coincide with the data ,",
    "the result is much improved .",
    "the branching ratios of processes @xmath80 and @xmath81 are predicted to be at the order of @xmath82 .",
    "they are difficult to be measured in the future as long as there is no new physical mechanism to greatly enhance them .    by studying the radiative decay of @xmath2 , we can learn much about the hadronic structure of @xmath14 . even though much effort has been made to explore the spin singlet @xmath14 , in particle data group ( pdg ) of 2008 ,",
    "@xmath14 was still omitted from the summary table @xcite .",
    "in fact , determination of the mass of @xmath14 is made via the radiative decays of @xmath83 @xcite , and the recent data show @xmath84 mev by the @xmath29 data and @xmath85 mev by the @xmath34 data @xcite .",
    "penin @xcite reviewed the progress for determining the mass of @xmath14 and indicated that the accurate theoretical prediction of @xmath36 would be a great challenge .",
    "indeed , determining the wave function of @xmath14 would be even more challenging .",
    "we carefully study the transition rates of the radiative decays which would help to extract information about @xmath36 .",
    "the transition rate of @xmath86 is very sensitive to the mass splitting @xmath87 due to the phase space constraint , thus an accurate measurement of the radiative decay may be more useful to learn the spin dependence of the bottominia .",
