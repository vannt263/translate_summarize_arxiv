    "space - time being isotropic and homogeneous implies that the vacuum state of a quantum field must be invariant under translations or rotations .",
    "the presence of external fields , a change in the geometry ( curvature , torsion ) or a change in the topology ( defects , boundaries ) of the space breaks the underlying symmetry of space - time , inducing changes in the vacuum state of the quantum field as compared to its field - free , unbound , minkovski space counterpart .",
    "this is the celebrated casimir effect  @xcite .",
    "topological defects certainly offer an interesting ( and quite unexplored ) arena for the study of vacuum polarization phenomena in condensed matter systems . in previous publications",
    "@xcite we studied the non - relativistic quantum mechanics of electrons and holes in the presence of a disclination in an insulating elastic medium , with and without an external magnetic field .",
    "in the present work , i study the casimir effect of the electromagnetic field in an infinite medium of constant dielectricity @xmath0 and permeability @xmath1 ( a nonmagnetic medium ) , with a disclination at the origin of the coordinate system , at zero temperature .",
    "it is investigated the electromagnetic casimir effect since it is more likely to be experimentally observable in the solid state than the fermionic case  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that massive fields , like the fermion field , give casimir energies exponentially decreasing with their mass .",
    "an estimate  @xcite for electrons confined to regions of nanometric s    ize , i.e. @xmath2 cm , gives an exponential damping factor for the casimir energy of @xmath3 .",
    "while the electromagnetic casimir energy for light confined to a similar region is @xmath4 , the electronic effect is then roughly @xmath5 weaker .",
    "notice that while reference  @xcite deals with the casimir effect due to confinement to mesoscopic regions , in this work the interest is in the effect outside a defect - no confinement envolved . in any case , one should expect a much weaker electronic casimir effect , then justifying the choice of presenting the electromagnetic effect here .",
    "quantum field theory has been extensively studied in the conical space - time of cosmic strings  @xcite .",
    "the large body of information available on this subject makes an excelent guide for the study of quantum field theoretical aspects of disclinations in solids , in the context of the theory of defects / three - dimensional gravity of katanaev and volovich  @xcite .",
    "disclinations , like cosmic strings , are associated with a conical metric  @xcite whose spatial part is given , in cylindrical coordinates , by @xmath6 with @xmath7 , the disclination is obtained by either removing ( @xmath8 ) or inserting ( @xmath9 ) a wedge of material , of dihedral angle @xmath10 , to the otherwise smooth elastic continuum .",
    "the resulting space , described by the above metric , has a null curvature tensor everywhere , except at the defect where it has a two - dimensional @xmath11-function singularity given by  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the two - dimensional delta function in flat space .",
    "it is clear that @xmath14 corresponds to a positive - curvature disclination and @xmath15 to a negative - curvature disclination .",
    "@xmath16 , of course , describes the euclidean medium ( absence of disclinations ) .",
    "the relevant physical quantity in the study of the casimir effect is the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor , or stress tensor , @xmath17 .",
    "since this tensor diverges , in order to obtain physically meaningful results , one should subtract from it its also divergent flat space version .",
    "that is , one should calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation value @xmath18 in this work , i will be concerned only with the @xmath19 component , since it is the one that gives the energy density .    being the electromagnetic field a gauge field , care must be exercised in order that appropriate gauge - fixing be taken into account in the quantum theory . as it turns out  @xcite the convenient gauge here is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electromagnetic vector potential . in this gauge",
    "the energy density assumes the very simple form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the scalar green s function , which in the absence of the defect is @xmath24 @xmath25 is the space - time interval between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , its square being given by @xmath28 the energy density is then @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scalar green s function in the medium with boundary conditions . due to the disclination ,",
    "the boundary condition in this problem is a periodicity of @xmath31 in the angular variable @xmath32 .",
    "accordingly , imposition of this condition on the free space green s function can be done by reperiodising it via the contour integral  @xcite @xmath33 the singularities in the integrand are poles that can be easily found by writing @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 since @xmath36 , the poles of @xmath37 are at @xmath38 . on the other hand , @xmath39 contributes with poles at @xmath40 . in both cases @xmath41 .    as shown in figure 1",
    ", the contour @xmath42 has two branches , one in the upper half @xmath43-plane from @xmath44 to @xmath45 passing below the singularity @xmath46 and the other in the lower half - plane from @xmath47 to @xmath48 passing above the singularity at @xmath49 .    in the limit @xmath50 the poles at @xmath38 will be lying at @xmath51 .",
    "so , one is left with poles at @xmath51 and @xmath40 . considering this",
    ", there is a deformation  @xcite of the contour @xmath42 that will prove to be quite convenient .",
    "just deform it into an anticlockwise loop @xmath52 around the pole at @xmath53 and the two vertical lines , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 a constant ( see figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this can only be done if the poles lying on the re@xmath43-axis , other than the one at @xmath53 , are outside the region limited by the lines ; i.e. , @xmath58 must be chosen to be less than the smaller of @xmath59 and @xmath31 .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the contribution from loop @xmath52 turns out to be exactly @xmath60 .",
    "since renormalization requires @xmath61 , all one has to consider is the contribution from the two vertical lines @xmath54 .",
    "equation ( 8) becomes then @xmath62    it is easily found that @xmath63 furthermore , using the symmetry of the contour @xmath54 to replace the exponential by a cosine in equation ( 10 ) and then deforming the contour into a clockwise loop around the origin leads to @xmath64 this integral can be easily evaluated using calculus of residues , by expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath43 such that the term of order @xmath65 gives @xmath66 .",
    "the expansion results in @xmath67 the energy density is then @xmath68 this result has been found by a variety of ways in the context of cosmic strings  @xcite and also for a metallic wedge  @xcite .",
    "notice that in the flat space limit , @xmath16 , @xmath69 as it should .",
    "also , although values of @xmath70 are probably not physically sensible for cosmic strings because it would correspond to negative linear mass densities , in condensed matter it describes negative - curvature disclinations  @xcite .",
    "the immediate consequence for condensed matter systems with such defects is a dependence of the sign of the force exerted on the defect by the electromagnetic vacuum , on the sign of the defect curvature .",
    "this is certainly important for the study of the stability of the defects .",
    "the obvious implication is that a disclination dipole , or edge dislocation  @xcite , is more stable than either disclination standing by itself and that the interaction between the pair is attractive .",
    "this is a result of the vacuum polarization of the electromagnetic field only .",
    "the total interaction and overall stability depend on contributions from all the relevant fields .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to draw attention to the importance of quantum field theoretical effects in condensed matter enclosing topological defects .",
    "a very simple case has been considered : the medium is infinite ( e.g. no external boundaries were considered ) , nonmagnetic , has only one defect ( disclination ) , its dielectricity is frequency - independent and the temperature set to @xmath71 . of course",
    ", these oversimplifications give a distorted picture of the real phenomenum .",
    "nevertheless , it is shown that a finite electromagnetic casimir energy density is present in the outer region of the disclination .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the present results to finite temperatures and to magnetic media .",
    "moreover , use of a frequency - dependent complex dielectric constant would not only provide a more realistic calculation for the casimir energy but also one that takes into account absorption of energy inside the dielectric , something that happens in real materials .",
    "+ * acknowledgements * + this work was partially supported by cnpq .",
    "+      the anticlockwise loop integral @xmath72 can be evaluated in the same way as the integral in equation ( 12 ) .",
    "again , symmetry of the contour permits the substitution of the exponential by a cosine .",
    "the resulting @xmath73 expanded around @xmath53 is @xmath74 implying @xmath75    99 v.m .",
