    "this document has been produced by the data model working group .",
    "it has been reviewed by ivoa members and other interested parties , and has been endorsed by the ivoa executive committee as an ivoa recommendation .",
    "it is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference from another document .",
    "ivoa s role in making the recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment .",
    "this enhances the functionality and interoperability inside the astronomical community .",
    "members of the ivoa data model working group , including representatives of the us nvo , astrogrid , and the euro - vo have contributed to the present draft .",
    "the editors particularly acknowledge the input from p.  didelon , g.  lemson , a.  rots , l.shaw , b.  thomas and d.  tody .",
    "f.  bonnarel and m.  louys acknowledge support from the french aci - grid project , _ idha _ and the eu - funded _",

    "this document defines an abstract data model called `` data set characterisation '' ( hereafter simply `` characterisation '' ) . in this introduction",
    "we present requirements and place the model in the broader context of vo data models . in section  [ sec : explore ] we introduce the concepts ( illustrated with some examples ) and discuss their interactions . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we present a formal uml class model using the concepts defined earlier .",
    "xml and votable serializations are presented in section  [ sec : serial ] and the appendices give further examples .",
    "characterisation is intended to define and organize all the metadata necessary to describe how a dataset occupies multidimensional space , quantitatively and , where relevant , qualitatively .",
    "the model focuses on the axes used to delineate this space , including but not limited to _ spatial _ ( 2d ) , _ spectral _ and _ temporal _ axes , as well as an axis for the _ observable _ ( e.g. flux , number of photons , etc . ) , or any other physical axes .",
    "it should contain , but is not limited to , all relevant metadata generally conveyed by fits keywords .",
    "characterisation is applicable to observed or simulated data but is not designed for catalogues such as lists of derived properties or sources ( see section  [ sec : othermodels ] ) .",
    "the model is intended to describe :    * a single observation ; * a data collection ; * the parameter space used by a tool or package accessed via the vo .",
    "the model describes the available data , not its history .",
    "for instance , spatial resolution expresses the level of smearing of the true sky brightness distribution in a data set without differentiating between contributions from different atmospheric , instrumental and software processing effects ( see section  [ sec : othermodels ] ) .",
    "characterisation has to satisfy two sets of requirements :    * data discovery requirements : + this model prescribes elements for use in requests to databases and services and thus forms a fundamental part of the standards for vo requests .",
    "the use of this model should enable a user to select relevant observations from an archive efficiently .",
    "the selection will be based purely on the geometry of the observations , that is , how and how accurately the multidimensional space is covered and sampled .",
    "+ discovery may only require a simplified overview ( e.g. position , waveband , average spatial resolution ) .",
    "data providers may opt for the inclusion of data where there is insufficient information to respond to certain parts of a query .",
    "eventually , it should be possible for a client to generate a detailed multidimensional footprint of an observation . for example : * * what observations from a particular archive are likely to have covered a specific vo event ? ( spatial and temporal coverage ) * * which ccd frames in a mosaic actually cover the position of a particular galaxy ?",
    "( detailed spatial coverage ) * * what observed spectra have a resolution comparable with a given simulated spectrum e.g. matching the shannon criterion ? ( sampling precision ) . *",
    "data processing / analysis requirements : + characterisation should detail the variation of sensitivity on all relevant axes ( e.g. variation of sampling or sensitivity across the field of view , detailed bandpass function ) , in order to provide information to an analysis tool or for reprocessing .",
    "+ errors may be provided for any or all axes .",
    "version 1 will fulfill all data discovery requirements , and allow some simple automatic processing such as cross - correlation and data set comparisons .",
    "full implementation of data processing / analysis requirements will only become available in a future version of this model .",
    "this document defines metadata items and organisation patterns for characterizing data products and their properties in the vo .",
    "it identifies some major contexts in which these patterns play a crucial role and it shows how metadata descriptions can be constructed in these contexts , in a form that is adjusted to the requirements for distribution and analysis of astronomical observations .",
    "however , the precise application of these patterns in other contexts may be different from these and we do therefore as yet not prescribe the precise syntax of characterization metadata in all contexts .",
    "that is left to the controlling documents .",
    "characterisation arose out of the `` observation data model '' , a high level description of metadata associated with observed data , described in an ivoa note available at the connection is summarised in fig.[fig : generalobscharac ] .",
    "it became obvious that there was an urgent need for a model to characterise the physical properties of data , alongside provenance , datacollection , curation etc .",
    "( which provide instrumental , sociological and other information ) .",
    "for example , provenance will be linked with characterisation to provide the telescope location ( needed for some coordinate transformations ) , calibration history , etc .",
    "interactions are organised so that each observation object of the observation data model will have a characterisation object encompassing the metadata relative to the physical axes along which the measurements are spanned .",
    "characterisation complements and extends some of the metadata adopted by the vo registry ( ) , providing the finer level of detail needed to describe individual datasets .",
    "concurrently to the characterisation dm , the spectrum modeling effort appeared ( ) , focusing on spectral data sets .",
    "it partly re - uses the characterisation metadata tree representation for data spanned along the spectral axis .",
    "data models for catalogues and sources are also being developed .",
    "ideally , all these models must be mutually consistent and employ the definitions supplied by the stc dm and/or by basic models describing astronomical quantities as was planned within the quantity dm .",
    "however some overlap and duplication may happen to allow data and service providers to use the parts they need without excessive effort .",
    "we introduce the physical axes used to define the n - dimensional space occupied by any data set or required for interpretation .",
    "when considering a typical astronomical observation , we have identified various properties :    * _ coverage : _ describes what direction the telescope was pointing in , at which wavelengths and when ; and/or the region covered on each axis .",
    "this is described in increasing levels of detail ( see section  [ sec : cover ] ) by : * * _ location _ * * _ bounds _ * * _ support _ * * _ sensitivity _ + if the data contain many small regions then the bounds may be qualified by a * * _ filling factor _ + ( especially if the support is not precisely defined ) . *",
    "_ sampling precision : _ describes the sampling intervals on each axis ; * _ resolution : _ describes the effective physical resolution ( e.g. psf , lsf , etc . ) .",
    "each property can be related to one or more physical axes , described in more detail in section  [ sec : props ] .",
    "for each axis :    * _ accuracy : _ describes the measurement precision , see section  [ sec : acc ] .",
    "the tables below illustrate how the spatial , temporal and spectral domains and the observable quantity of some typical data sets can be described , at various levels of complexity , using the properties from section [ sec : concepts ] .",
    "table  [ tab : evt ] shows some of the characterisation metadata for an x - ray event list .",
    "additional examples are presented in appendix c : table  [ tab:2dim ] for a 2-d image , table  [ tab:1dspec ] for a 1d spectrum , table  [ tab:3dspec ] for an ifu dataset , table  [ tab : rad ] for a radio interferometry image service and table  [ tab : sim ] for simulated data .    in some of these examples , some concepts are interdependent , discussed further in section  [ sec : axesatt ] .",
    "all these concepts can be applied to any data set but some elements may not have defined values , or the origin may be arbitrary , for example the spatial location of a generic simulated galaxy cluster ( table  [ tab : sim ] ) .",
    "._property versus axis description of metadata describing an * x - ray ccd event list*. this also characterises the potential images and other products which can be derived . during exposure ,",
    "the instrument moves with respect to the sky , so , for example , the sensitivity is a function of the support on the first three axes . _",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     0.1 in",
    "the first three levels of characterisation are now fully described and take explicit values .",
    "the fourth level of the structure can contain functions ( e.g. the variation of noise with position ) or urls ( e.g. the location of a weight map ) .",
    "data providers may have varying expectations about how these advanced metadata should be delivered , so we will expand the description of this level in a future version of the model , after polling the community for the use of weight maps , variability maps , etc ... we anticipate that the first three levels will answer more than 70% of present needs .    it is not yet possible to implement rules linking coverage on different axes . for example , if a survey consists of spatially distinct fields , observed in several wavebands , but there are fields which do not contain all wavebands , then each field and/or each waveband must be described separately .",
    "similarly , separate descriptions are required if resolution or noise ( for instance ) behave differently in various areas of support .",
    "several tools are being developed to assist data providers supply metadata .",
    "these include extraction of information from fits headers and a form interface called camea which allows the user to enter values for characterisation elements and translates this to xml .",
    "we will also provide xml templates for manual editing .",
    "we will investigate what would be more convenient for large data collections depending on how they store their existing metadata .",
    "metadata required by characterisation might be extracted from a number of sources such as :    * an archive database ; * an observing log or other description which might be stored in a database or as ascii , xml or other documents ; * fits headers , which provide more or less direct routes : * * unambiguous identification between e.g. a database column or fits keyword and a characterisation element ; * * correspondence with formulaic modification , e.g. adding explicit units or calculating the field of view of an interferometer ; * * a separate information source e.g. resolution of the telescope using different frequencies / configurations ; * * offine / human memory / judgement    the following sections outline our proposals for which of the status strings mandatory , recommended or optional should be applied to each element of the xml schema .",
    "the status strings are used as in the siap proposed recommendation ( ) , interpreted as follows :    * mandatory means that the metadatum is fully required to make the data usable in basic vo services * recommended means that this item should be given if at all possible to improve the interpretation of the data or their use in a wider range of vo services * optional means that such metadata elements would help to give more precise interpretation but are not vital .",
    "an implementation may have one among the following level of compliance and be :    * `` partially compliant '' , if it implements some ( but not all ) mandatory / must elements * `` compliant '' , if it implements all mandatory / must elements * `` fully compliant '' , if it implements * all * mandatory / must elements and * all * recommended / should ones    the prime goal is to get this model applied by data providers in useful ways .",
    "we should make it as easy as possible to describe any kind of observed or simulated data by minimising the number of compulsory fields . at the same time we must encourage data providers to give enough information to expand the ways in which data can be selected or manipulated by vo tools currently or imminently available .        on each axis , the first three levels ( location , bounds , support ) , must be given explicit numerical values ( or arrays of values ) in order to be accessible to any tool .",
    "other elements may be given numerical values , or functions , or indirect references ( uris ) but these are in general not used at present .",
    "users are strongly encouraged to evaluate coarser levels of description explicitly even if they also provide finer levels .",
    "we need to decide what users do if they are not giving a value for an element e.g. leave blank , consistent with other models .",
    "location , bounds and other higher characterisation levels are intentionally approximations to provide a simple inclusive description of the data .    the location value may be determined with some error , which might be mentioned inside the stc structure used for coordinates .",
    "this is to be distinguished from bounds which should be the outer limits to anywhere data might be found .",
    "accuracy properties describe uncertainties in the mapping process of data values along axes , see section  [ sec : macc ] .",
    "the values for some elements must be given as arrays , defined as in stc , and the required number of arguments must be present if any are .",
    "bounds , for instance , describes a unique region on an axis as e.g. @xmath0 , whilst the resolutionsupport is given relatively e.g. telescope beam major and minor axes in arcsec and position angle .",
    "defaults might sometimes be possible for values which have not been provided .",
    "we do not think that such defaults should be coded into the description , rather that software which looks for the value of a missing element might be able to make an intelligent assumption .",
    "it is up to the writers of a software tool specification to decide whether it is more dangerous to use defaults and risk a lower level of accuracy , or to ignore data which is not adequately specified and thus loose potentially important information .",
    "for example , if * location * is not given then , for some axes , software may take the default * location * as the mid - point of the * bounds*.    if * bounds * are not given then e.g. if a spatial axis has coordsys icrf some software might assume all - sky coverage .",
    "if * support * is not given * bounds * , if present , could be used .    if the * unit * or * coordsys * element is not given for any level , the values for the * characterisationaxis * are used ; be careful , as this may be unsuitable ( e.g. if the * characterisationaxis * units are sexagesimal , then a single number for an error could be in degrees or arcsec or ... ) .",
    "it is mandatory to provide at least one axis ( coded as a * characterisationaxis * element ) .",
    "all three of the space , time and spectral coverage axes are recommended .",
    "the unit and coordinate system are mandatory for each axis present",
    ". these may be relative to an internal reference only , e.g. pixel spatial coordinates .",
    "in such a case both the * location * and * bounds * are mandatory for that axis .",
    "note that stc allows ` relocatable ' , for example as a valid * location * for simulated data , unless this is incompatible with the specified coordinate system .",
    "space- , spectral- and time - related axes , and most other potential axes , are already defined in stc ; where this is the case , it is mandatory to use the stc coordinate system and unit definitions .",
    "various cases of how to re - use stc elements are shown in the example xml documents provided .",
    "the * _ observable _ * axis is recommended .",
    "axes which are not yet defined in stc ( such as polarization at the present time ) are optional but a reference to the definition of the proper coordinate system should be given .      for each *",
    "characterisationaxis * element ( spatial , spectral , observable , etc . ) : + a flag to indicate if it is an independent or a dependent variable ( ` true ' or ` false ' ) is recommended . + a flag to indicate its calibration status is recommended : + calibrated , uncalibrated , relative , normalized ; default uncalibrated .",
