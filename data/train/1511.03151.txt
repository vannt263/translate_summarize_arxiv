    "near - infrared ( nir ) integral - field spectroscopy ( ifs ) is a powerful tool to study the star formation and nuclear activity of dust - enshrouded galactic nuclei .",
    "integral - field spectroscopy provides spectra for every spatial pixel which allows the extraction of gaseous and stellar distribution and kinematics , as well as the study of excitation mechanisms in a spatially resolved way .",
    "the nir is less affected by dust absorption than the optical and mainly traces the mass - dominating old stellar population .",
    "an example is our study of ngc 7172 , formerly classified as seyfert-2 galaxy , where we detect broad hydrogen emission lines ( indicative for a broad - line region ) behind a dust - lane which hides the real center in the optical light ( smaji  @xcite ) .",
    "we present our recent studies that are based on observations with the nir ifs sinfoni ( eisenhauer  @xcite , bonnet  @xcite ) which has a typical spectral resolution of @xmath0 and a spatial resolution of @xmath1arcsec ( seeing - limited ) or @xmath2mas ( adaptive optics ) resp .",
    "first , we briefly discuss the importance of nir observations for the interpretation of sub - mm alma data .",
    "then , we show first results from a nir ifs study of the nuclear star - formation properties of the seyfert-2 galaxy ngc 7496 .",
    "finally , we discuss the impact of circumnuclear star formation in low - luminosity qsos on the black hole mass ( @xmath3 ) - bulge luminosity ( @xmath4 ) relation .",
    "the nuclei of galaxies ( nuga ) project ( garca - burillo  @xcite ) comprises a sample of two dozens of nearby galaxies which span the whole range of nuclear activities .",
    "two galaxies from the nuga sample have recently been observed in the nir with sinfoni and in the sub - mm with alma .    in ngc 1433 , we can determine the real position of the agn only from the nir data .",
    "a steep velocity gradient in the center ( in alma / co and sinfoni / warm h@xmath5 ) is observed that could be interpreted as molecular outflow .",
    "however , from nir emission line diagnostics , we conclude that the nuclear star formation rate is low compared to other low - luminosity agn .",
    "this means that the outflow would be essentially triggered by the agn alone ( combes  @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is a nuclear disk ( smaji  @xcite ) .    in ngc 1566",
    ", we find a star - formation region in @xmath6 distance from the nucleus . from nir emission lines",
    ", we estimate the star formation rate in the circumnuclear disk to be @xmath7 .",
    "the molecular gas content from nir agrees with the gas mass from co ( @xmath8 ; combes  @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the nuclear region has a large reservoir of molecular gas that is not used efficiently .",
    "nir line ratios show that the gas infall is accompanied by young star formation ( @xmath9 ; smaji  @xcite ) .",
    "the central @xmath10 of ngc 7496 were observed with eso - sinfoni in @xmath11-band .",
    "the galaxy is a nearby barred spiral ( sbbc ) , at a distance of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "previous studies of this agn in the mid - infrared show a very hot dust temperature ( @xmath14 ; prieto  @xcite ) . in the nir ,",
    "the continuum emission fit also shows a dust temperature of around @xmath15 , which is high for a seyfert-2 ( fig .",
    "[ figure ] ( a ) ) .",
    "we see indications that the nucleus might power a very faint and narrow broad line region ( @xmath16 ; valencia - s .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this motivates us to study the gas content and dynamics in the center of this galaxy .",
    "the spectrum shows a variety of strong emission lines . in a forthcoming paper ( fazeli )",
    ", we investigate the properties of these emission lines and their ratios to trace circumnuclear star formation regions and reveal their excitation conditions , morphology , and stellar content .",
    "is apparent . _",
    "right _ : ( black hole mass ) - ( bulge luminosity ) relation . llqsos do not follow these relations . ]",
    "to fill the gap between nearby seyfert galaxies and high-@xmath18 quasar samples , we also study low - luminosity qsos ( llqso ) . the llqso sample ( e.g. , bertram  @xcite , busch  @xcite ) contains 99 nearby type-1 quasars with redshift @xmath19 and connects nearby agn and more distant quasars in many properties ( moser  @xcite ) .",
    "owing to their larger distance , the angular scale is less by a factor of @xmath20 ( which is still resolvable in detail ) .",
    "however , their bolometric luminosities and accretion rates are higher by several magnitudes which makes them interesting to study ( see also new survey : www.cars-survey.org ) .",
    "using black hole masses from single - epoch spectroscopy and bulge luminosities from bulge - disk - bar - agn decomposition ( using budda , gadotti @xcite ) of deep nir images ( from sofi@ntt and luci@lbt ) , we show that llqsos do not follow @xmath17 relations established for inactive galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ figure ] ( b ) ; busch  @xcite , busch  @xcite ) .",
    "possible explanations are ( 1 ) bulges which are over - luminous due to star formation / young stellar populations or ( 2 ) undermassive black holes that are in a growing phase .",
    "understanding this offset has important implications on the co - evolution of bhs and bulges .",
    "sun  ( @xcite ) investigate the `` flow patterns '' of bhs and their host galaxies in the @xmath21 relation and show that galaxies that are off - set from the relation have evolutionary vectors anti - correlated with their position , indicating that they are moving back towards the relation .    to understand the behaviour of llqsos in these relations ,",
    "detailed studies of nuclei of llqsos are performed . in a pilot study , we observed he 1029 - 1831 with sinfoni , seeing - limited and with adaptive optics ( busch  @xcite , busch  @xcite , moser  @xcite ) .",
    "we detect a star - forming ring around the nucleus with radius @xmath22 . comparing observables like the equivalent width of br@xmath23 or the supernova rate ( derived from [ feii ] flux ) to models from starburst99 ,",
    "we conclude that the ring experienced a starburst with time scale @xmath24 that began @xmath25 ago .",
    "the bulge luminosity is dominated by this intermediate - age stellar population which explains the offset in the @xmath17 relation , at least in this particular case .",
    "we discussed the power of near - infrared integral - field spectroscopy to analyze nuclear activity and star formation in nearby agn and low - luminosity qsos .",
    "furthermore , we showed that these observations are crucial for a thorough analysis of sub - mm alma observations of the gas content .",
    "a bigger sample of nearby seyferts will allow us to probe possible relations between nuclear activity and nuclear star formation in great detail .",
    "more observations of llqsos are necessary to robustly determine the impact of nuclear star formation on the position of these objects in @xmath17 relations .        99 bertram , t. , eckart , a. , fischer , s. , 2007 , a&a , 470 , 571 .",
