    "after the discovery @xcite of standard model ( sm ) higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , low - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite which is favored by the naturalness argument @xcite has been extensively explored .",
    "these studies show the difficulties in the both theoretic explanation of 125 gev higgs mass and experimental fits to the lhc data .",
    "the second run of lhc will shed light on the prospect of such natural susy models .",
    "given above consideration some efforts have been devoted to the study of high - scale susy .    even though high - scale susy can not be detected at the @xmath2 tev lhc , they can be still studied via their effects on the evolution of early universe .",
    "measurement on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 via experiments such as wamp , plank and bicep that are devoted to measure cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy and polarization during inflation , may probe high - scale susy with mass spectrum far above the weak scale .",
    "the measured value of @xmath0 reported by the plank collaboration is of order @xmath3 at 95 % cl @xcite , from which the energy scale of inflation can be directly inferred . since the energy scale of inflation is proportional to @xmath4 , it is only mildly sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "so the study of high - scale susy remains well motivated as long as @xmath0 is not extremely small .    in this paper",
    ", we consider inflationary models with @xmath0 far below the plank bound value @xmath5 .",
    "the motivation is mainly based on two facts . at first",
    ", the stability of the sm electroweak vacuum requires @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 refers to the value @xmath8 at which the higgs potential is maximal . for the central value of top quark pole mass @xmath9 gev , which implies that @xmath10 should be smaller than plank bound value @xmath11 gev corresponding to @xmath12 @xcite . in this sense small @xmath13 is more favored to guarantee the electroweak vacuum stable against quantum fluctuation during inflationary epoch .",
    "secondly , for @xmath13 , it can still generate susy mass spectrum large enough to escape the lhc constraints .    for simplicity",
    "we adopt the assumption that the inflation and visible ( namely the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ) sector share the same origin of susy breaking .",
    "this assumption is rational , as it can be realized in model building .",
    "moreover , it allows us to discuss reheating in the early universe after inflation , once the susy mass spectrum and the inflaton decay are identified explicitly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we re - analyze the model independent consequences from above assumption within the range @xmath13 . in section 3 , we consider hybrid inflation as an example in the course of high - scale susy breaking .",
    "we will show that a new linear term for inflaton field with a large coefficient proportional to @xmath14 affects the inflation significantly , and the simplest hybrid inflation is consistent with @xmath0 of order @xmath1 .",
    "in the second part of this paper we discuss the reheating in the early universe after inflation in section 4 .",
    "in particular , reheating temperature @xmath15 after inflation is estimated for superpartner mass spectrum @xmath16 above @xmath17 tev . we find that @xmath15 might be beneath the value @xmath18 gev required by thermal leptogenesis if inflaton decays to its products perturbatively , but above it if non - perturbatively instead .",
    "the gravitino overproduction in conventional high - scale susy can be easily evaded because of kinematically blocking effect .",
    "finally we conclude in section 5 .",
    "in this section we revise the model independent implications ( together with plank and 9-year wamp data ) to single - field inflation for @xmath19 .",
    "these results provide useful information on the model building of inflation , as a reliable inflation model should at least explain observable quantities as what follows .",
    "@xmath20 , first of all the scale of energy density during inflation is directly related to @xmath0 as , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the amplitude of the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation and @xmath23 in the context of single - field inflation . recall that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the value of @xmath26 when wavenumber @xmath27 mpc@xmath28 crossed outside the horizon . substituting the reported value @xmath29 by plank collaboration @xcite into eq.([energydensity1 ] )",
