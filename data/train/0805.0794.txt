    "the question of whether laboratory spin glasses  or the theoretical models used to represent them  have a thermodynamic phase transition remains unresolved despite decades of work  @xcite .",
    "although the infinite - range sherrington - kirkpatrick  ( sk ) ising spin glass is easily shown to possess a phase transition  @xcite , the existence of one in the corresponding short - range edwards - anderson  ( ea )  @xcite ising model ( on the cubic lattice @xmath1 ) has not been established in _ any _ finite dimension . while some evidence for a transition has been uncovered through high - temperature expansions  @xcite , analytical studies of variable long - range @xmath2 models  @xcite , and extensive numerical simulations  @xcite ,",
    "the issue remains unresolved  @xcite .",
    "random graph methods , and in particular the fortuin - kastelyn  ( fk ) random cluster  ( rc ) representation  @xcite , provide a set of useful tools for studying phase transitions ( more specifically , the presence of multiple gibbs states arising from broken spin rotational symmetry ) in discrete spin models . in these representations",
    "spin correlation functions can be expressed through the geometrical properties of associated random graphs .",
    "fk and related models are probably best known in the physics literature for providing the basis for powerful monte carlo methods for studying phase transitions  @xcite , but they have also proved important in obtaining rigorous results on phase transitions in discrete - spin ferromagnetic ( including inhomogeneous and randomly diluted ) models  ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . because of complications due to frustration , however , graphical representations have so far played a less important role in the study of spin glasses .    the goal of the studies presented here is to construct a viable approach which uses random graph methods to address the problem of phase transitions and broken symmetry in spin glass models . in earlier papers  @xcite , we studied the `` percolation signature '' of spin glass ordering within two different graphical representations  the two - replica model of chayes , machta and redner  ( cmr )  @xcite and a two - replica version of the fk  representation  ( trfk ) , as proposed in sec .",
    "4.1 of  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of that analysis was to show that fk methods could be utilized to study spin glass phase transitions .",
    "the result of this work was the uncovering of strong evidence that the existence of a spin glass transition coincides with the emergence of _ doubly _ percolating clusters of _ unequal _ densities .",
    "this scenario is more complex than what occurs in ferromagnetic models , where the phase transition coincides with percolation of a single fk cluster .    in what follows ,",
    "we first review the fk random cluster representation for ferromagnetic models , and then describe our analytical and numerical results for spin glasses .",
    "in this section we briefly review the fortuin - kasteleyn random cluster representation  @xcite which relates the statistical mechanics of ising ( or potts ) models to a dependent percolation problem",
    ". our focus will be on ising models throughout , but the analysis is easily extended to more general potts models .",
    "we start by considering a nearest - neighbor ising ferromagnet , whose couplings @xmath3 are not necesarily identical :    @xmath4    where , as already noted , @xmath3 and the sum is over nearest neighbor pairs of sites in @xmath5 .",
    "each such coupling is associated with an edge , or bond , @xmath6 , with the set of all such bonds denoted @xmath7 .",
    "the rc approach introduces parameters @xmath8 through the formula : @xmath9\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the inverse temperature .",
    "one can then define a probability measure @xmath11 on @xmath12 , that is , on 0- or 1-valued bond occupation variables @xmath13 .",
    "it is one of two marginal distributions ( the other being the ordinary gibbs distribution ) of a joint distribution on @xmath14 of the spins and bonds together ( such a joint distribution will be introduced in sec .",
    "[ subsec : cmr ] ) .",
    "the marginal distribution @xmath15 is given formally by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a normalization constant , @xmath18 is the number of clusters determined by the realization @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the bernoulli product measure corresponding to independent occupation variables with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the indicator function on the event @xmath23 in @xmath12 that there exists a choice of the spins @xmath24 so that @xmath25 for all @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "there are several things to be noted about  ( [ eq : mufk ] ) .",
    "the factor 2 in the term @xmath26 arises because we ve confined ourselves to ising models , so that every connected cluster of spins ( each such connected cluster consists of all satisified bonds ) can be in one of two states ( in the ferromagnetic case , all up or all down ) ; in a @xmath27-state potts model , this term would then be replaced by @xmath28 .",
    "more importantly , the indicator function on @xmath23 , which is the event that there is no frustration in the occupied bond configuration , is always one for the ferromagnet ; consequently , this term is superfluous for ferromagnetic models .",
    "we include it , however , because it will be needed when we generalize to models with frustration .",
    "finally , we note that finite - volume versions of the above formulas , with specified boundary conditions , can be similarly constructed .    in the case of a ferromagnet ,",
    "there are general theorems  @xcite which ensure that when percolation occurs , there is a unique percolating cluster .",
    "it then easily follows that rc percolation within the fk representation ( or `` fk percolation '' for short ) corresponds to the presence of multiple gibbs states ( in the ferromagnet , magnetization up and magnetization down ) , and moreover that the onset of percolation occurs at the ferromagnetic critical temperature . to prove this",
    ", it is sufficient to show that fk percolation is both necessary and sufficient for the breaking of global spin flip symmetry in the ferromagnet . to see that fk percolation is a necessary condition ,",
    "note that the contribution to the expectation of @xmath29 from any finite rc cluster is zero : if a spin configuration @xmath30 is consistent with a given rc bond realization within such a cluster , so is @xmath31 , and both will be equally likely . as a consequence , @xmath32 in infinite volume in the absence of rc percolation .    to see that rc percolation is a sufficient condition for the magnetization order parameter to be nonzero , consider a finite volume @xmath33 with fixed boundary conditions , i.e. , a specification @xmath34 for each @xmath35 .",
    "for the ferromagnet , by first choosing all @xmath36 and then all @xmath37 , one can change the sign of the spin @xmath29 at the origin even as @xmath38 .",
    "that is , boundary conditions infinitely far away affect @xmath29 , which is a signature of the existence of multiple gibbs states .",
    "when attention is confined to ferromagnetic models , the mapping of the fk formalism to interesting statistical mechanical quantities is straightforward ( and intuitive ) ; for example @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the usual gibbs two - point correlation function and @xmath41 is the rc probability that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are in the same cluster . similarly ,",
    "with `` wired '' boundary conditions ( i.e. , each boundary spin is connected to its nieghbors ) , one has @xmath44 so for ferromagnets , a phase transition from a unique ( paramagnetic ) phase at low @xmath10 to multiple infinite - volume gibbs states at large @xmath10 is equivalent to a percolation phase transition for the corresponding rc measure .      for spin glasses ( or other nonferromagnets with frustration )",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "now for two sites @xmath42 and @xmath43 , ( [ eq : ferropath ] ) becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 is any path of occupied bonds from @xmath42 to @xmath43 . by the definition of @xmath23 , any two such paths @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the _ same",
    "_ cluster will satisfy @xmath48 .",
    "just as in the ferromagnet , if percolation of a random cluster occurs in the fk representation , the percolating cluster is unique ( in each realization of fk spins and bonds )  @xcite . in spite of this ,",
    "rc percolation alone is no longer sufficient to prove broken spin - flip symmetry in the ea spin glass .",
    "this is because even in the presence of rc percolation , it is unclear whether there exist any two sets of boundary conditions that can alter the state of the spin at the origin from arbitrarily far away .",
    "although the infinite cluster in any one rc realization is unique , different rc realizations can have different paths from @xmath49 , and because of frustration this can lead to different signs for @xmath29 .",
    "so percolation might still allow for @xmath50 as @xmath38 , independently of boundary condition .",
    "indeed , it is known that fk bonds percolate well above the spin glass transition temperature .",
    "for the three - dimensional ising spin glass on the cubic lattice , fortuin - kasteleyn bonds percolate at @xmath51  @xcite while the inverse critical temperature is believed to be @xmath52  @xcite . near the spin glass critical temperature ,",
    "the giant fk cluster includes most of the sites of the system . for this reason , the swendsen - wang algorithm , though valid ,",
    "is inefficient for simulating spin glasses .",
    "however , it is an open question as to whether the presence of `` single '' ( see below ) fk percolation would lead to a slower , e.g. power - law , decay of correlation functions even though the gibbs state is unique .",
    "if this were to happen , then the onset of single fk percolation would imply a phase transition in the spin glass , though not multiple gibbs states and hence no broken spin - flip symmetry .",
    "this possibility was suggested in  @xcite ; but to date , no evidence exists to support it .    nonetheless , single fk percolation remains a _ necessary _",
    "condition for multiple ( symmetry - broken ) gibbs phases in the spin glass , for the same reason as for the ferromagnet .",
    "a slightly stronger version of that argument  @xcite proves that the transition temperature for an ea spin glass , if it exists , is bounded from above by the transition temperature in the corresponding ( disordered ) ferromagnet .",
    "the essential difference ( from the point of view of fk percolation ) between the ferromagnet and the spin glass is the factor @xmath22 in  ( [ eq : mufk ] ) .",
    "it is somewhat easier to discuss this factor in the context of finite volumes .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the @xmath53 cube centered at the origin , and let @xmath54 denote the set of bonds @xmath55 with both @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath33 . for models containing frustration , @xmath23 is typically _ not _ all of @xmath56 , unlike for the ferromagnet ; it is the set of all _ unfrustrated _ bond configurations ( so that the product of couplings around any closed loop in such a configuration is always positive ) .",
    "so is there a way to extend the above considerations to arrive at a sufficient condition for multiple gibbs states in spin glass models ?",
    "we begin by noting that fk clusters identify magnetization correlations ; but spin glass ordering is manifested by the edwards - anderson  ( ea ) order parameter , and not the magnetization , becoming nonzero .",
    "the ea order parameter @xmath57 can be defined with respect to two independent replicas of the system , each with the same couplings  @xmath58 . denoting the spins in the two replicas by @xmath24 and @xmath59 , each taking values @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath57 is defined in terms of the overlap , @xmath61 in the limit as the number of sites @xmath62 . in general",
    ", @xmath63 is a random variable whose maximum possible value is @xmath57 , but in the case where ( in the limit @xmath62 ) @xmath24 and @xmath59 are drawn from a single pure state , @xmath63 takes on only the single value @xmath57 .    using this as a guide",
    ", it appears that one possibility , proposed in  @xcite , for extending fk methods to spin glasses is to use what might be called _",
    "double _ fk percolation .",
    "here one expands the sample space @xmath64 to include two independent copies of the bond occupation variables ( for a given @xmath65 configuration ) , and defines the variable @xmath66 , where @xmath13 and @xmath67 are taken from the two copies .",
    "one then replaces percolation of @xmath19 in the single rc case with percolation of @xmath68 .",
    "it is not hard to see that this would be a sufficient condition for the existence of multiple gibbs phases ( and consequently , for a phase transition ) .",
    "this is not the only way , however , to use `` double '' percolation of rc clusters in some form to arrive at a condition for spin glass ordering ; the above describes what we denoted in the introduction as the trfk approach . in the next subsection we present a closely related approach , the crm two - replica graphical representation , which requires a more lengthy description .",
    "once this is done , we will discuss how both representations can be used to illuminate the nature of phase transitions in short - range spin glass models .      in describing these `` double fk '' representations",
    ", we will find it useful to reformulate our description of the relevant measures slightly using a joint spin - bond distribution introduced by edwards and sokal  @xcite .",
    "the statistical weight @xmath69 for the edwards - sokal distribution on a finite lattice @xmath33 is @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the number of occupied bonds and @xmath72 is the total number of bonds on the lattice .",
    "the factor @xmath73 is introduced to require that every occupied bond is satisfied ; it is defined by @xmath74 with @xmath75 defined as in  ( [ eq : pxy ] ) and with all @xmath76 , it is easy to verify that the spin and bond marginals of the edwards - sokal distribution are the ferromagnetic ising model with coupling strength @xmath77 and the fortuin - kasteleyn random cluster model ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : mufk ] ) ) , respectively .",
    "we can now adapt the above representation to the @xmath0 ising spin glass .",
    "( with minor modifications , it can also be adapted to gaussian and other distributions for the couplings . )",
    "the corresponding edwards - sokal weight is the same as that given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : es ] ) .",
    "the @xmath78 factor must still enforce the rule that all occupied bonds are satisfied , @xmath79 so ( cf .  ( [ eq : mufk ] ) ) @xmath80 .",
    "the spin marginal of the corresponding edwards - sokal distribution is now the ising spin glass with couplings @xmath58 .",
    "but the relationship between spin - spin correlations and bond connectivity is complicated by the presence of antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "now one has    @xmath81    the two - replica cmr graphical representation , introduced in  @xcite , incorporates , in addition to the spin variables @xmath24 and @xmath59 , two sets of bond variables @xmath19 and @xmath82 , each taking values in @xmath83 .",
    "now the edwards - sokal weight is @xmath84 where the @xmath85 s are bernoulli factors for the two types of bonds , @xmath86 and the bond occupation probabilities are @xmath87 so @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath78 and @xmath89 factors constrain where the two types of occupied bonds are allowed , @xmath90    we refer to the @xmath91-occupied bonds as `` blue '' and the @xmath92-occupied bonds as `` red '' .",
    "the @xmath78 constraint says that blue bonds are allowed only if the bond is satisfied in both replicas .",
    "the @xmath89 constraint says that red bonds are allowed only if the bond is satisfied in exactly one replica .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the spin marginal of the two - replica edwards - sokal weight is that for two independent ising spin glasses with the same couplings , @xmath93\\ ] ]    connectivity by occupied bonds in the two - replica representation is related to correlations of the local spin glass order parameter , [ sec : pgr ] @xmath94 it is straightforward to verify that @xmath95 as in the case of the fk representation , a minus sign complicates the relationship between correlations and connectivity but in a conceptually different way .",
    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trcor ] ) is independent of the underlying couplings in the model and is present for both spin glasses and ferromagnetic models .    as noted earlier , for ferromagnets ( in the absence of non - translation - invariant boundary conditions ) , the signature of ordering is a _ single _ percolating fk cluster . for spin glasses ,",
    "the situation is more complicated as there can be more than one percolating cluster .",
    "however , if the cmr graphical representation displays a single percolating blue cluster of largest density , one can similarly show broken symmetry , for either ea or sk models .",
    "this is because one can impose `` agree '' or `` disagree '' boundary conditions between those @xmath96 and @xmath97 boundary spins belonging to the maximum density blue network . in the infinite volume limit , these two boundary conditions give different gibbs states for the @xmath30-spin system ( for fixed @xmath98 ) related to each other by a global spin flip ( of @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is a separate matter , however , to relate in a simple way the ea order parameter to the density difference in blue ( or more generally , doubly percolating ) clusters .",
    "intuitively , it seems that there should be a simple correspondence , and in fact such a relation is easy to show for the sk model : here the overlap @xmath63 is exactly the difference in density between two percolating blue clusters  @xcite .",
    "but it is not immediately obvious that a similar density difference can be simply related to the ea order parameter ( although the arguments above imply that here also a density difference implies a nonzero @xmath63 . )",
    "this is because in a two - replica situation , it is not immediately obvious that there is no contribution from finite clusters in short - range models .    for the trfk representation ,",
    "similar reasoning shows that the occurrence of exactly two doubly - occupied percolating fk clusters with different densities implies broken symmetry for the spin system  @xcite and that @xmath63 should equal ( and once again , does equal in the sk model ) the density difference . in  @xcite we presented preliminary numerical evidence that there is such a nonzero density difference below the spin glass transition temperature for the @xmath99 ea @xmath0 spin glass ( for both the trfk and cmr representations ) .",
    "we will discuss these results further in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] .",
    "but now we turn to a review of some rigorous results , particularly for the sk model , that appeared in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sk model permits a fairly extensive rigorous analysis of both the cmr and trfk representations which , when combined with other known results , permits a sharp picture to emerge of the connection between double fk percolation ( we use this more general term to refer to any representation that relies on two fk replicas , such as cmr or trfk ) , and a phase transition to a low - temperature spin glass phase with broken spin - flip symmetry . the surprising feature to emerge from this analysis",
    "is that in the cmr representation , there already exist well _ above _ the transition temperature two percolating networks of blue bonds , of equal density and in all respects macroscopically indistinguishable . below the critical temperature @xmath100",
    ", the indistinguishability is lifted : the two infinite clusters assume different densities .    on the other hand , there is no double fk percolation at all above @xmath100 in the trfk representation , but below @xmath100 there are again two percolating double clusters of unequal density .",
    "we do not yet know whether this difference in the two pictures above @xmath100 persists in the ea model , but numerical evidence ( to be discussed in the next section ) so far appears to indicate that it does not : in the ea spin glass , both representations seem to behave similarly to cmr in the sk model .",
    "the sk hamiltonian for an @xmath101-spin system is @xmath102 where @xmath103 are vertices on a complete graph .",
    "the couplings @xmath104 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables chosen from a probability measure @xmath105 satisfying the following properties :    \\1 ) the distribution is symmetric : @xmath106 .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath105 has no @xmath107-function at @xmath108 .",
    "\\3 ) the moment generating function is finite : @xmath109 for all real @xmath110 .",
    "\\4 ) the second moment of @xmath105 is finite ; we normalize it to one : @xmath111 .",
    "so the results of this section hold for gaussian and many other distributions ( although not diluted ones , because of requirement ( 2 ) ) , but the analysis is simplest for the @xmath0 model , to which we confine our attention for the remainder of this section .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath112 with equal probability ; for this distribution ( or any other satisfying property ( 3 ) ) @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "it is relatively easy to see , using a heuristic argument presented in  @xcite , at what temperature a single fk cluster will form .",
    "the sk energy per spin , @xmath114 , is given above the critical temperature by @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath101 the fraction @xmath116 of satisfied edges is @xmath117    from  ( [ eq : pxy ] ) it follows that a fraction @xmath118 of satisfied edges are occupied . according to the theory of random graphs ( see  @xcite ) , a giant cluster forms in a random graph of @xmath101 vertices when a fraction @xmath119 of edges is occupied with @xmath120 , and there is then a single giant cluster  @xcite .",
    "so if edges are satisfied independently ( which of course they re not  this is why this argument is heuristic only ) , then single replica fk giant clusters should form when @xmath121 when @xmath120 .",
    "the single replica fk percolation threshold is therefore at @xmath122 and above this threshold , there should be a single giant fk cluster .",
    "this simple argument can be made rigorous  @xcite , but the basic ideas are already displayed above .",
    "the rigorous argument obtains upper and lower bounds for the conditional probability that an edge @xmath123 is satisfied , given the satisfaction status of all the other edges .",
    "if these bounds are close to each other ( for large @xmath101 ) then treating the satisfied edges as though chosen independently can be justified .",
    "we now describe that argument .    to avoid the problem of non - independence of satisfied edges , we fix all couplings @xmath124 but one , which we denote @xmath125 , and ask for the conditional probability of its sign given the configuration of all other couplings and all spins @xmath96 .",
    "the ratio @xmath126 of the partition functions with @xmath127 and @xmath128 satisfies @xmath129 the conditional probabilities @xmath130 that @xmath131 therefore satisfy @xmath132    let @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) be the conditional probability for any edge @xmath123 to be satisfied ( unsatisfied ) given the satisfaction status of all other edges .",
    "these must then be bounded as follows : @xmath135 and therefore    @xmath136    one now obtains rigorously the same conclusions as before  i.e. , ( [ eq : fkperc ] ) is valid with a single giant fk cluster for @xmath137 with any @xmath120 .",
    "essentially the same argument is used for the more interesting case of double percolation .",
    "here there are two spin replicas denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath98 .",
    "we are now interested in percolation of doubly satisfied edges ; the spins at the vertices of each such edge must satisfy @xmath138 ( and then will be satisifed for exactly one of the two signs of @xmath124 ) .",
    "we note an immediate difference between the cmr and trfk representations : for the former , doubly satisfied edges are occupied with probability @xmath139 , while for the latter , @xmath140 ^ 2 \\sim 4\\beta^2/n$ ] .",
    "it seems likely that this difference occurs only for the sk model ; the various factors of @xmath101 are absent in the ea model .",
    "we can proceed much as in the single - replica case by dividing all @xmath141 configurations into two sectors  the _ agree _ ( where @xmath142 ) and the disagree sectors ( where @xmath143 ) .",
    "we also denote by @xmath144 and @xmath145 the numbers of sites in the sectors and denote by @xmath146 and @xmath147 the sector densities ( so that @xmath148 ) .",
    "the spin overlap @xmath63 is then just @xmath149 for @xmath150 , @xmath151 as @xmath152 ( because the ea order parameter is zero in the paramagnetic phase ) while for @xmath153 , @xmath154 as @xmath152 , where @xmath155 denotes an average over couplings .",
    "so it must be that @xmath156 for @xmath157 while @xmath158 for @xmath159 .",
    "the arguments for the single replica case can be repeated separately within the agree and disagree sectors .",
    "letting @xmath160 denote the conditional probabilities that @xmath161 given the other @xmath162 s and all @xmath96 s and @xmath97 s , we have within either of the two sectors that @xmath163 so that the conditional probability _ within a single sector",
    "_ @xmath164 for @xmath165 to be doubly satisfied is @xmath166 . for @xmath167 ,",
    "we have @xmath168 , @xmath169 ( in the limit @xmath152 ) and so in either sector , double fk percolation is approximately a random graph model with @xmath170 sites and bond occupation probability @xmath171 ; thus double fk giant clusters do not occur for @xmath172 in the trfk representation .    in the cmr representation",
    ", blue percolation corresponds to bond occupation probability @xmath173 @xmath174 and so the threshold for blue percolation is given by @xmath175 .",
    "but now there are _ two _ giant clusters , one in each of the two sectors , and as noted above they satisfy @xmath156 when @xmath176 . for @xmath177 , @xmath178 . since @xmath179 for @xmath177 ( indeed for any fixed @xmath180 ) , it follows from random graph theory that each giant cluster occupies the entire sector so that @xmath181 and @xmath182 are also the cluster percolation densities of the two giant clusters .    in the case of two - replica fk percolation for @xmath177 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath183 and @xmath184 the larger and smaller of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , so that @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",

    "there will be another giant cluster ( of lower density ) in the smaller sector providing @xmath190 .",
    "since @xmath191 , for this to be the case it suffices if for @xmath177 , @xmath192 the estimated behavior of @xmath57 both as @xmath193 and as @xmath194  @xcite suggests that this is always valid . in any case , we have rigorously proved that there is a unique maximal density double fk cluster for @xmath177 .",
    "an important feature of spin glass order is ultrametricity , which is believed to be true at least for the sk model  @xcite , although it has not yet been proved rigorously . for",

    "the issue of percolation signatures for ultrametricity in the sk model is treated at length in  @xcite .",
    "we only mention here one of those signatures , which concerns the _ four _ percolating clusters that arise in a cmr representation of three replicas when considering bonds that are simultaneously blue _ both _ for replicas one and two as well as for replicas one and three . denoting the four cluster densities in rank order as @xmath197 , the percolation version of the ultrametric property",
    "is that @xmath198 _ and _ @xmath199 . the case @xmath200 ( resp . , @xmath201 ) corresponds to @xmath202 ( resp , @xmath203 ) .",
    "see  @xcite for more details .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations to explore the properties of two - replica fk representations described in the previous sections for the case of the three - dimensional @xmath0 ea spin glass .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm that we use also makes use of the cmr representation in addition to parallel tempering and metropolis sweeps .",
    "similar methods have been previously applied by swendsen and wang  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is described in more detail in @xcite , here we provide some additional details about the cmr component of the algorithm .",
    "the cmr cluster algorithm alternates between `` bond moves '' and `` spin moves . ''",
    "the bond move takes a pair of ea spin configurations @xmath24 and @xmath59 , both in the same realization of disorder , @xmath58 , and populates the bonds of the lattice with red and blue cmr bonds .",
    "each bond that is satisfied in both replicas is occupied with a blue bond with probability @xmath204 and each bond that is satisfied in only one replica is occupied with a red bond with probability @xmath205 , defined in ( [ eqn : blue ] ) and ( [ eqn : red ] ) , respectively .",
    "the bond move is described by the conditional probability , @xmath206 for bond configuration @xmath207 given spin configuration @xmath208 . to simplify the notation",
    ", we omit the lattice indices and the dependence on @xmath124 in the following equations except where explicitly needed . for the bond move",

    "all spin configurations obeying the constraints that blue bonds are doubly satisfied and red bond are singly satisfied have the same probability .",
    "the spin move is described by the conditional probability , @xmath210 : @xmath211    a bond move followed by a spin move constitututes a single sweep of the cmr cluster algorithm .",

    "more importantly , there is a second transition occurring at exactly the sk spin glass critical value @xmath246 . above this threshold ,",
    "the two giant clusters take on unequal densities , whose sum is one ( i.e. , every bond and spin belong to one of the two giant clusters )",
    ". it could be the case at some even higher @xmath10 there is only a single giant cluster , but our methods so far are unable to determine whether this is the case .    for trfk percolation",
    "there are no giant clusters above @xmath247 . for @xmath248",
    "there are exactly two giant clusters with unequal densities , and the picture then becomes similar to that of the cmr representation .",
    "the numerical simulations of the 3d ea model suggest a scenario similar to what we find in the sk model .",
    "we observe a sharp percolation transition for both the cmr and trfk representations at a temperature well above the spin glass transition temperature . at this percolation transition ,",
    "two giant clusters form with opposite values of the ea order parameter .",
    "these clusters are nearly equal in density and together occupy most of the system .",
    "as the temperature is decreased toward the presumed location of the spin glass transition , the density of the two clusters becomes increasingly unequal .",
    "although this transition in the density of the two largest clusters appears quite rounded for the small systems investigated numerically , we believe it is sharp in the thermodynamic limit . the results for both the sk model and the connection between the ea order parameter and the density difference between giant clusters strongly suggests that the spin glass transition in finite dimensions is marked by the onset of this density difference in both the cmr and trfk representations .",
