    "the first theory of condensation originated with the celebrated equation of state of van der waals  @xcite : @xmath7 when complemented with the maxwell construction ( or `` equal area rule '' ) , leads to isotherms describing general characteristics of the liquid - vapor equilibrium , including the existence of a critical temperature .",
    "the isotherms obtained with the van der waals - maxwell theory have a very simple analytic structure : they are analytic in a pure phase and have analytic continuations along the liquid and gas branches , through the transition points . these analytic continuations , which were originally interpreted as describing the pressure of metastable states , are provided by the original isotherm given in .",
    "+ the theoretical question of knowing whether the results predicted by the van der waals theory can be derived from first principles of statistical mechanics remained a longstanding problem during a large part of the twentieth century .",
    "the theories of mayer @xcite and yang - lee @xcite were decisive contributions to the theory of phase transitions , but did nt give an answer concerning the delicate question of the analytic continuation at transition points .",
    "with regard to this latter property , two scenarios were discussed in the fifties and sixties .",
    "+ the first one was essentially based on the mean field ( or bragg - williams ) approximation @xcite . in this approach , the interaction is replaced by an infinite range and infinitely weak potential .",
    "the central characteristic of the effective model obtained after this approximation is that the spatial positions of the particles do nt play any role . as a consequence ,",
    "an exact computation of the partition function leads to the same behaviour as in the van der waals - maxwell theory : at low temperature , thermodynamic potentials are analytic in a pure phase , and have analytic continuation at transition points .",
    "katsura @xcite conjectured that this scenario holds also for short range models , like the ising model ( see also the discussion below ) .",
    "+ the second argument , totally different in spirit , originated with the so called `` droplet mechanism '' of the condensation phenomenon , proposed by andreev @xcite , fisher @xcite and langer @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , as opposed to the mean field approximation , predicts that the finiteness of the range of interaction plays a crucial role in the analytic properties of the thermodynamic potentials .",
    "namely , when the range of interaction is finite , droplets of any size are stable at the condensation point , and although the probability of occurence of large droplets is very small , they yield a contribution of the order @xmath8 to the @xmath9-th derivative of the pressure . kunz and souillard",
    "were led to the same conclusions after having studied a similar model , related to percolation @xcite .",
    "+ subsequent papers on the subject , in which no definite answer was given , include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recent studies can also be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the first rigorous result was the study of isakov @xcite on the ising model , which confirmed the droplet predictions : + * isakov ( 1984 ) : * _ in dimension @xmath0 , at low enough temperature , the pressure of the ising model in a magnetic field @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is infinitely differentiable at @xmath12 , but has no analytic continuation from @xmath13 to @xmath14 accross @xmath15 , or vice versa . _ + this result is obtained by showing that the derivatives of the pressure at @xmath15 behave like @xmath16 in a second paper @xcite , isakov tried to extend this result to general two phase lattice models .",

    ", only an upper bound can be obtained on the integral , of the same order @xmath119 .",
    "the crucial point is therefore to have large enough neighbourhoods @xmath106 , in order to show that @xmath120 .",
    "in the framework of kac potentials , the role played by the range of interaction in the analyticity properties of the pressure can be clarified by the following discussion . when @xmath121 , our analysis allows to decompose the pressure in two distinct parts : @xmath122    on one hand , @xmath123 is constructed with the partition function @xmath98 of , and describes a homogeneous phase with positive magnetization , containing no droplets of the @xmath124 phase .",
    "when @xmath6 , @xmath123 converges to the pressure of the mean field model . on the other hand , @xmath125 contains the contributions from the droplets of the @xmath124 phase , which are all stable at @xmath15 , and @xmath126 .",
    "namely , the main contribution to @xmath125 comes from the smallest droplets , which live on a coarse - grained lattice whose cells have side length @xmath4 .",
    "then , the pressure @xmath123 behaves analytically at @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath127 for all @xmath9 , but @xmath125 is responsible for the absence of analytic continuation at @xmath15 , since @xmath128 for large enough @xmath9 .",
    "the combination of these two behaviours leads to a crossover in the derivatives , as was shown in theorem [ t4 ] .",
    "+ our results also have an important consequence regarding the theory of condensation initiated by mayer @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the pressure of a non - ideal gas is described , near @xmath129 ( @xmath130 is the fugacity ) , by a convergent taylor expansion , given by the mayer series : @xmath131 ( the @xmath132 are the cluster coefficients . )",
    "that is , the pressure is analytic in the gas phase .",
    "then , the condensation point is defined to be the first singularity encountered when is continued analytically along the positive real line @xmath133 .",
    "it was suggested by some authors @xcite that this method could actually lead to a wrong determination of the condensation point : the analytic continuation of the mayer series might not `` see '' the real transition point @xmath134 , situated somewhere between @xmath61 and @xmath135 : @xmath136 .",
    "this is indeed the case in the mean field approximation : the system does not `` see '' the condensation point , since there are no droplets of the liquid phase inside the gaseous phase .",
    "we saw that if one suppresses the condensation mechanism by retaining , in , only the term @xmath137 , then there is an analytic continuation of the pressure .",
    "our analysis shows that the phenomenon of condensation itself is responsible , through the singular term @xmath138 , for the singularity .",
    "therefore , the latter method of determining the condensation point gives the correct result , at least for a large class of lattice gas models .",
    "+ to conclude , we mention that the problem of knowing whether the pressure can be continued analytically around the singularity , in the complex plane , remains open .",
    "it is not clear , in this case , whether the droplet models can be used as a guiding mechanism , even to give a heuristic description  .",
