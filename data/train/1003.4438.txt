    "since the discovery of the massive electroweak gauge bosons @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite , we are sure to observe electroweak symmetry breaking in nature . however , the underlying dynamics of this symmetry breaking has not yet been established experimentally .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking via the higgs mechanism @xcite is an appealing theoretical suggestion for such a dynamics .",
    "depending on the specific model considered , the higgs mechanism implies the existence of one or more scalar particles ( higgs bosons ) .",
    "therefore , the search for higgs bosons is an important task in the quest to unravel the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking at high energy collision experiments .    besides inclusive single higgs production , higgs boson production in association with a high-@xmath1",
    "hadronic jet provides a useful channel for higgs searches at hadron colliders , which allows for refined cuts increasing the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "specifically , for the standard model ( sm ) higgs plus jet process  @xcite , early simulations considering the decay channels @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite have demonstrated promising signal - to - background ratios .",
    "while the promising findings of the parton - level study @xcite were confirmed by a simulation using the fast ( and less detailed ) simulation for the atlas detector response @xcite , an up - to - date simulation of the detailed atlas detector performance appeared in @xcite . from the cms collaboration ,",
    "only a simulation of the inclusive @xmath16 channel is currently available @xcite .",
    "considerable progress has been made in improving the sm cross section predictions : the fully differential distribution for higgs production is available at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd accuracy in the large top - mass limit @xcite , improved by the resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms for low @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "dedicated calculations of higher - order corrections to differential cross sections for higgs boson production associated with a high-@xmath1 jet have been performed : the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections in the large top - mass limit @xcite and the corresponding resummation of large threshold logarithms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the soft - plus - virtual gluon approximation to the nlo qcd prediction of the higgs @xmath1 distribution @xcite goes beyond the large top - mass limit . for the @xmath13-quark process @xmath18",

    "the remaining scale uncertainty of the nlo qcd result for the higgs plus high-@xmath1 jet production cross section via the light quark parton processes is at the level of 10% @xcite .",
    "the achievement of this level of accuracy in the qcd corrections , albeit in the large top - mass limit , motivates to study other leading order contributions which could potentially affect the higgs plus jet cross section prediction at the 10% level .",
    "specifically , there are to consider : loop - induced electroweak contributions to the processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the light quark flavours ( @xmath21 ) and the contributions from the processes @xmath22 and @xmath23 . all these contributions may change the differential distributions of the process , which are therefore of particular interest .",
    "parts of these contributions to the higgs plus jet cross section have been considered elsewhere .",
    "electroweak and non - zero quark - mass effects on the higgs @xmath1 distribution using 5-flavour parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) neglecting the contributions from @xmath13-quark parton processes have been studied for the lhc and the tevatron in @xcite .",
    "leading order qcd and electroweak contributions to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 processes , including electroweak contributions to the @xmath13-quark processes enhanced by the top - higgs yukawa coupling , have been studied for the lhc in @xcite .",
    "however , the impact of those contributions on the total higgs plus jet cross section , which involves also the dominant gluon fusion channel , has not been studied in @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , a combination of the contributions of the light quark flavours ( @xmath26 ) and the bottom quarks in order to get a cross section prediction for higgs plus ( any ) jet in a 5-flavour scheme has so far only been done for the leading - order qcd predictions @xcite .    in the present paper , we study the combined effect of contributions of leading order ( lo ) electroweak loop graphs and bottom - quark parton processes on the jet pseudorapidity ( @xmath0 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) distribution of higgs + high-@xmath1 jet production .    in order to obtain the best lo prediction",
    ", we employ a somewhat different scheme than usual , which particularly affects the bottom - quark processes .",
    "instead of discarding higher order contributions in the cross section predictions according to mere power counting of qcd and electroweak couplings ( @xmath27 ) , regardless of the appearing type of yukawa coupling ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , we argue that keeping the lo contributions to each monomial in @xmath28 and @xmath29 and discarding the higher order contributions to each of them separately , gives a more accurate approximation to the full result .",
    "this approach is particularly well - suited for the bottom - quark processes , because in this case tree - level graphs @xmath30 and one - loop graphs @xmath31 contribute and just discarding the loop - contributions because of the higher power of @xmath32 does not do justice to the hierarchy of yukawa couplings @xmath33 in the standard model .    as the higgs plus @xmath13-jet final state is also of separate interest , in particular in models beyond the sm , where the top and bottom yukawa couplings can be dramatically different",
