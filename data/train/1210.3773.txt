    "recurrences play an important role in physics .",
    "the statistics of the recurrence times of particles govern the transport properties of open systems such as quantum dots attached to external leads , and the relaxation characteristics of distribution functions in closed systems , see ref .",
    "[ ] . additionally , in the short wavelength limit , quantum mechanical properties such as energy level correlations@xcite , weak localization@xcite and shot noise@xcite , are also determined by recurrences of the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "one of the basic statistical characteristics of recurrences in open systems is the distribution of poincar recurrence times , @xmath0 .",
    "this is the probability of a trajectory to return , at time larger than @xmath1 , to a predefined region in phase space . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the the distribution of poincar recurrence times of `` mixed '' chaotic systems ( more precisely - one dimensional symplectic maps ) . in these generic systems",
    "the phase space consists of islands of regular dynamics immersed in a sea of chaotic behavior , and around these islands there are smaller satellite regular motion islands around which are even smaller islands , and so forth _ ad infinitum_@xcite . in such systems ,",
    "a trajectory within the chaotic component of the phase space may stick to the regular islands for an exceedingly long time .",
    "this feature is believed to manifest itself in an algebraic decay of the distribution of poincar recurrences in the long time asymptotic limit : @xmath2    many studies have investigated this algebraic decay , focusing on two main issues : the question of universality of the decay exponent @xmath3 , and the calculation of its actual value . yet , after three decades of studies , the answers to these questions are still controversial .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies @xcite yield a variety of values for @xmath3 ranging from 1 to 3 .",
    "some of the numerical studies have obtained different values even for the very same system .",
    "a possible explanation to this odd situation is that the long time asymptotic behavior of the poincar recurrence distribution can not be reached within the existing computational power .",
    "the numerical calculation of @xmath3 in the long time asymptomatic limit is exceedingly difficult .",
    "trajectories of a particle moving in the intricate hierarchical structure of the phase space are very sensitive to numerical noise .",
    "such a noise may transfer the particle from regions of chaotic motion to regular ones and vice versa , and can also help in crossing cantori which serve as leaky barriers within the phase space .",
    "these uncontrolled artifacts , apparently , hinder the identification of the true asymptotic behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "this explanation , however , relies on the assumption that even in the absence of numerical noise the convergence of the poincar recurrence distribution to its asymptotic behavior is very slow .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study this aspect of the relaxation problem .",
    "we show that @xmath0 exhibits time dependent fluctuations which do not decay fast enough in time .",
    "consequently @xmath0 at different time intervals seems to exhibit different relaxation behavior which may be interpreted as different relaxation exponents .",
    "this behavior is demonstrated in fig .  1 where the numerical calculation of @xmath0 for the standard map is depicted on a log - log scale .",
    "it shows that different time intervals may be associated with different decay exponents . thus convergence to the asymptotic behavior is extremely slow , and not monotonous , but rather oscillatory in @xmath4 .",
    "these variations in the relaxation dynamics emerge from random - like local variations in the phase space of the chaotic component of mixed systems .",
    "the trajectories that contribute to @xmath0 as time progresses are trajectories which become closer to the boundaries of the regions with regular motion .",
    "the closer the trajectory approaches to such a boundary , the longer it sticks to it .",
    "this behavior implies that self - averaging of the relaxation dynamics is not very effective and therefore the convergence to the asymptotic value of the decay exponent is rather slow as demonstrated in fig .  1 .",
    "obviously , a direct study of the fluctuations of @xmath0 around its asymptotic behavior ( [ power - law ] ) , whether analytical or numerical , suffers from the same difficulties of the calculation of the asymptotic decay exponent itself . to circumvent this difficulty it is convenient to introduce an ensemble of mixed chaotic systems and to use ensemble averaging in order to extract the properties which characterize the relaxation dynamics .",
    "this is similar in spirit to disorder averaging@xcite which allows one to characterize the dynamics of a particle in disordered system , such as the correlation function of its position at different times .",
    "however , unlike disordered systems where the meaning of their ensemble is well understood , it is unclear what might be the invariant measure of the ensemble of mixed chaotic systems .",
    "nonetheless , the role of the ensemble averaging which we shall employ here is merely a regularization procedure which allows one to extract the intrinsic properties of the pure system .",
    "it is similar to the introduction of an infinitesimal noise into the dynamics of a hard chaotic system in order to extract the pollicott - ruelle resonances which characterize the relaxation of the pure system@xcite .",
    "thus here we shall use disorder diagrammatics in order to perform averages and identify the correlation function of the fluctuations in the return probability .",
    "then we shall use this result to calculate the typical value of the local fluctuations in the decay exponent @xmath5 , and show that @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is an oscillatory function .",
    "our analytical analysis of the problem is based on the rate equation model for the dynamics of mixed chaotic systems developed by meiss and ott @xcite . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model where following cristadoro and ketzmerick@xcite we add a small random component to the transition rates of the original meiss - ott model . in section",
    "iii we present the solution of the pure model , and in section iv we use the results of disorder diagrammatics to calculate the correlation function of the fluctuations in the return probability .",
    "this correlation function will be used in sec .",
    "v in order to derive formula ( [ deltagammamain ] ) for the local fluctuations in the decay exponent . in sec .",
    "vi we shall present numerical calculations which support our analytical results , and conclude in sec .",
    "the technical details of our calculations can be found in the appendices .",
    "in this section we present our model for the ensemble of mixed chaotic systems .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the statistical characteristics of the dynamics of mixed chaotic systems can be described by rate equations .",
    "first , let us recall the rate equations approach for mixed chaotic systems introduced by meiss and ott@xcite .",
    "their model assumes that the dynamics within the chaotic component of the phase space can be approximated by the master equation for the probabilities of finding the particle in states which respect the self - similar structure of the phase space , see illustration on the left panel of fig .  2 .",
    "each one of the meiss - ott states is associated with a definite region of the phase space whose boundaries ( represented by the dashed lines in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 ) are determined by lowest flux cantori encircling the relevant set of regular islands .",
    "the topology of the phase space division is that of a cayley tree , as shown in the right hand side of fig .  2 .",
    "namely , a particle in a given state might move either to a single lower state of the hierarchy or to one of two possible higher states .",
    "a `` level '' transition is associated with transition to a state which is closer to the boundary circle of the island chain it is presently revolving around , while a `` class '' transition corresponds to the case where the particle moves into a higher state associated with one of its present satellite island chains , see fig .  2 .",
    "the binary structure of meiss - ott tree allows one to designate the states of the system by binary numbers : a state reached by level transition is denoted by the number of the previous state to which a figure `` 1 '' is added , while a that reached by class transition is obtained by adding the figure `` 0 '' , as demonstrated in the right hand side of fig .  2 .",
    "let @xmath9 represent some arbitrary state on the tree , and denote by @xmath10 the nearest state at the upper part of the tree from which the particle may arrive .",
    "we shall also denote by @xmath11 and @xmath12 the two states down the tree reached by class and level transitions , respectively . with these definitions ,",
    "the master equation takes the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability to find the particle in the state @xmath9 , while @xmath15 is the transition rate from the state @xmath9 to @xmath16 .",
    "meiss and ott assumed that these transition rates satisfy a simple scaling behavior : @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , are constants which have been estimated to be@xcite : @xmath23 within this model it is also assumed that a particle staying in the upper state of the tree leaves the tree at rate @xmath24 and never return back . from here on , the escape rate @xmath24 will be set to unity by choosing proper units of time .",
    "it is known , however , that the rates ratios ( [ ratio1 ] ) and ( [ ratio2 ] ) fluctuate considerably at different positions of the tree@xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to generalize the meiss - ott model by adding a random component to the transition rates , i.e. to replace the constant transition rates by fluctuating ones : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are assumed to be uncorrelated random variables with zero mean , @xmath27 here @xmath28 is a dimensionless constant which controls the amount of randomness of the ensemble .",
    "this ensemble is based on two main assumptions : ( a ) the main source of fluctuations comes from the flux exchange between states , while deviations from the scaling behavior of phase space areas of the states may be neglected .",
    "( b ) the fluctuations in the flux exchange through different boundaries of the states are uncorrelated .",
    "the above choice implies that statistical properties of the dynamics on small scales of the phase space is the same as at larger scales with the proper rescaling of time .",
    "we shall refer to this ensemble as the `` random tree model '' .    in order to identify the relation between the functions @xmath29 and the survival probability , @xmath0 , let us sum the master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) over all the states of the tree @xmath9 : @xmath30 the left hand side of this equation is precisely the derivative of the survival probability , @xmath31 , since the sum over @xmath14 is the probability to find the particle at any site on the tree . from here and",
    "( [ power - law ] ) it follows that the long time asymptotic decay of @xmath32 is @xmath33 thus one may study the convergence to this asymptotic limit by analyzing the behavior of the return probability @xmath34 this is the probability density that a particle is found at upper site of the tree , @xmath35 assuming that at @xmath36 the particle is placed at the same site .",
    "in this section we review the solution of the meiss - ott model that describes the pure system , thereby presenting some of the ingredients which will serve us in the next section where we consider the random model .",
    "let us define the probability @xmath37 of a particle , initially placed at site @xmath16 , to be at site @xmath9 at time @xmath1 .",
    "we define the green function , @xmath38 , as the laplace transform of @xmath37 , @xmath39 our aim is to characterize the analytic structure of the green function associated with the return probability to the upper site of the tree , @xmath40 . in particular we shall focus our attention on the analytic structure in the vicinity of the point @xmath41 which governs the long time asymptotic behavior of the return probability ( [ retprobdef ] ) . in this vicinity one",
    "expects @xmath40 to take the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are some analytic functions .",
    "since the inverse laplace transform of an analytic function decays , in time , faster than any power law , the long time asymptotic behavior ( [ ltab ] ) comes from the nonanalytic contribution represented by the second term of the expansion ( [ tildeexp ] ) .",
    "meiss and ott proved that @xmath45 satisfies the dispersion equation@xcite : @xmath46 this equation is obtained by substituting ( [ tildeexp ] ) into the equation that the green function @xmath40 satisfies .",
    "it is rederived using a diagrammatic approach in appendix a.    let us examine the solutions of the dispersion equation ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) .",
    "apart from a single purely real solution the other solutions of this equation appear in complex conjugate pairs . in fig .",
    "3 we present some of these solutions in the complex plain @xmath47 . from here",
    "it follows that the solutions are divided into two groups . in each one of these groups ,",
    "the real parts of the solutions are approximately the same .",
    "the difference between the solutions is mainely due to their imaginary parts .",
    "the solution with smallest real part is @xmath48 this solution governs the asymptotic long time behavior .",
    "the solutions with the next smallest real part are @xmath49 , while the next solutions are @xmath50 .",
    "thus the general expansion of the green function near @xmath41 is @xmath51 the form of decay associated with complex solutions of the form @xmath52 is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is some constant . thus neglecting the difference in the real parts of the solutions we see that the long asymptotic behavior of the return probability of the pure system is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is non - periodic oscillatory function whose behavior depends on the initial conditions of the system .",
    "@xmath56 may be approximated by the leading solutions of the dispersion equation ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath54 are positive constants , and @xmath60 is the imaginary part of the next to leading solution of the dispersion equation ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) .",
    "while ensemble averaging is not required for extracting the long time asymptotic decay of the return probability , the sample to sample fluctuations are defined only with regard to ensemble . in this section",
    "our goal is to calculate the correlation function of the sample to sample fluctuations : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the deviation of the return probability of the system with the random component , @xmath63 , from the average over the ensemble @xmath64 .",
    "since we employ the ensemble averaging procedure only as a tool for extracting the intrinsic properties of the system , we may assume that fluctuations in the transition rates are small , @xmath65 , and exploit @xmath28 as the small parameter of the perturbation theory .",
    "the details of this perturbation theory are presented in appendix b.    the correlation function ( [ correlation - fluc ] ) may be written as a double inverse laplace transform @xmath66 where the constant @xmath67 in the integration contour is set to ensure the convergence of the integral , and @xmath68 is the disconnected part of the correlation of the green function @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the green function of the random tree model . in appendix",
    "b it is shown that , to the lowest order in @xmath28 , @xmath71 stratifies the equation :    @xmath72       \\label{q - eq }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 \\label{lambdafor }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath74 is a function expressed in terms of the green function of the pure system , @xmath40 .",
    "its explicit form can be found in appendix b.    from the structure of eq .",
    "( [ q - eq ] ) it follows that its solution contains two contributions : the homogeneous solution and the inhomogeneous one .",
    "consider first the inhomogeneous solution which we denoted by @xmath75 .",
    "focusing our attention on the terms which are relevant for the long time asymptotic behavior we expand this solution in the form    @xmath76    where @xmath77 represent functions that are analytic in @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) . substituting this form in ( [ q - eq ] )",
    "it is evident that with a proper choice of the functions @xmath77 one can satisfy the equation term by term .",
    "the first two terms of the expansion ( [ q - expansion ] ) are analytic either in @xmath78 or in @xmath79 and therefore do not contribute to the long time asymptotic behavior of the fluctuations . the third term , near @xmath81 ,",
    "may be written in the form of a product : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the expansion coefficients of the green function ( [ g - expansion1 ] ) , and @xmath84 is a constant which may be expressed in terms of @xmath85 , and the parameters ( [ parameters ] ) .",
    "this implies that the contribution to the correlation function of the fluctuations in the long time asymptotic limit is proportional to the product of the return probabilities : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the return probability of the system without the random component , see appendix a.    consider now the homogeneous solutions of eq .",
    "( [ q - eq ] ) , which we shall denote by @xmath88 .",
    "the total solution of the equation is @xmath89 and its inverse laplace transform gives the correlation function @xmath90-see eq .",
    "( [ eq : convolution ] ) .",
    "the homogeneous solution is needed in order to satisfy the condition @xmath91 for any @xmath1 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is because at the initial time of evolution @xmath93 as the system is prepared in such a way that the particle is with probability one at the upper state of the tree , @xmath94 . to obtain the long time asymptotic behavior of the homogeneous solution",
    ", we expand @xmath95 in the form    @xmath96    where @xmath97 are analytic functions at @xmath81 and @xmath98 are unknown exponents . substituting this expansion in the homogeneous equation obtained from ( [ q - eq ] ) , and solving the resulting equation term by term , one obtains that the contribution associated with the slowest decay exponents ( which comes from the third term in the expansion ( [ q - expansion2 ] ) ) should satisfy the dispersion equation : @xmath99 where @xmath100 this equation , similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) , has many solutions for @xmath101 which form two branches similar to those which appear in fig .",
    "the solution with the smallest positive real part satisfies the relation @xmath102 , and for the parameters ( [ parameters ] ) its value is @xmath103 .",
    "other exponents belonging to the same branch have the approximate form @xmath104 for example @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "since the dispersion equation ( [ mu3 ] ) constrains only the sum of exponents ( [ muav ] ) there is apparently a continuous set of solutions associated with different values of the difference between the exponents , @xmath107 , the weight of each one of these solutions is determined by @xmath108 .",
    "this approach does not allow us to determine these weights since our solution is valid in the long time asymptotic limit while the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) corresponds to short time dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , we may express the homogeneous contribution to the correlation function , in the long time asymptotic limit , as a sum @xmath109 where @xmath110 are some unknown constants and @xmath111 are the solution of the dispersion equation ( [ mu3 ] ) .",
    "here we assume that the sum is only over the solutions with positive imaginary part .",
    "in particular for @xmath112 one obtains @xmath113 where @xmath114 is an oscillatory function which similarly to @xmath115 ( see eq .",
    "( [ h1]))may be approximated in the long time asymptotic limit as @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are some constants , and @xmath119 represent the imaginary part of the solutions of the dispersion equation ( [ mu3 ] ) .",
    "now from ( [ deltap2 in ] ) , ( [ delta2pt ] ) and the results presented in sec .",
    "v we get that the variance of the normalized fluctuations @xmath120 , in the long time asymptotic limit , and to the leading order in @xmath28 ( where @xmath121 should be replaced by @xmath122)takes the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 thus the normalized fluctuations in the return probability decay to a constant value very slowly and in an oscillatory manner as function of @xmath4 . finally , using the above results for the homogeneous and inhomogeneous contribution to the correlator @xmath126 , and expanding it to second order in @xmath127 , we obtain :    @xmath128    where @xmath129 and is @xmath130 is an oscillatory function with expansion similar to ( [ h2 ] ) but with different coefficients . from here",
    "one obtains the correlator of the normalized fluctuations @xmath131 where @xmath132 to obtain this result we take into account that @xmath56 is approximately constant and thus @xmath133 may be approximated by the first term on the right hand side of ( [ htilde ] ) .",
    "in this section we calculate the typical value of the sample to sample fluctuation in the local behavior the decay exponent @xmath45 . for this purpose",
    "let us present the return probability in the form @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the long time asymptotic limit of the average of the return probability over the ensemble which to the leading order in the disorder may be taken as the return probability of the pure system , ( [ pt ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath136 is the normalized sample to sample fluctuation which is characterized by the correlation function ( [ rmain ] ) .",
    "assume one wishes to extract the decay exponent @xmath45 , of some particular system , from the measurement of @xmath63 at two time points , say @xmath137 where the time difference @xmath138 between the measuring points is assumed to be smaller than @xmath1 , @xmath139 ( as is the general situation when one tries to extract the limiting value of the decay exponent from the tail of @xmath63 ) .",
    "assuming that within this range the local behavior is @xmath140 , one obtains that @xmath141 thus @xmath142 can be associated with the normalized fluctuations of the return probability , @xmath143 . expanding the above logarithm to the leading order in @xmath144",
    ", one may express the mean square of the fluctuations in the decay exponent in the form @xmath145 using ( [ rmain ] ) and ( [ fluct ] ) we obtain @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are given by ( [ beta1 ] ) and ( [ beta2 ] ) respectively .",
    "both functions are oscillatory in @xmath4 and decay as @xmath149 .",
    "thus the typical fluctuation in the value of decay exponent decays as @xmath150 , where @xmath151 . from here",
    "one concludes that the fluctuations decay very slowly in time and in an oscillatory manner .",
    "in this section we present our numerical study which has the following goals : first to verify our analytical solution .",
    "second to show that the results that we have obtain in the limit @xmath65 are insensitive to the magnitude of the random component of the transition rates .",
    "third , to compare our results with those obtained from the exact dynamics of an ensemble of symplectic maps .    our numerical study of the random tree model is performed directly for the survival probability , @xmath0 , rather than the return probability @xmath63 .",
    "the computations are performed using 1000 realizations of the ensemble of random tree model with 9 generations .",
    "the random variables @xmath152 , are chosen form a uniform distribution .",
    "the relation ( [ sur - ret - rel ] ) implies that @xmath0 behaves in a similar way to @xmath63 .",
    "in particular one expects that @xmath153 where similar to ( [ pt ] ) , the function @xmath154 is an oscillatory function whose expansion is the same as that of @xmath155 but with different coefficients . yet , formula ( [ h1 ] ) describes the behavior in the very long time asymptotic behavior , while within the time limits were our calculation is reliable one has to take into account also terms associated with the second branch of solutions of the dispersion equations ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) that are associated with faster decaying rates ( see right branch of solutions in fig .  3 ) .    the numerical calculation of @xmath154 for the pure tree model",
    "is presented by the black dots in fig .",
    "this solution is obtained by calculating the normal modes of the tree model and expanding the solution in these modes .",
    "the solid line in this figure represents the analytical solution described by the function @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the slowest oscillatory solutions of the dispersion equation ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) while the term @xmath159 comes from the linear in @xmath78 term of the expansion of the function @xmath43 of the green function ( [ tildeexp ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath160 and @xmath118 are fitting parameters .",
    "the analytical solution gives an excellent fit to the numerical data except at very large times where numerical errors are large .",
    "notice that the amplitude of the oscillatory component of @xmath161 is very small , thus to good approximation it may be considered to be constant .",
    "let us consider the behavior of @xmath162 . from formula",
    "( [ avdseltasquare ] ) , expressions ( [ beta1 ] ) and ( [ beta2 ] ) , and taking into account that to a good approximation @xmath161 may be replaced by constant , it follows that @xmath163 may be expanded in terms of the solutions @xmath164 , of the dispersion equation ( [ mu3 ] ) , namely @xmath165 the black dots in fig .",
    "5 represent the numerical calculation of this function for the case were @xmath166 , while the solid line is the analytical expression ( [ analytical ] ) in which we took the four slowest oscillatory solutions of ( [ mu3 ] ) and use @xmath167 and @xmath118 as fitting parameters .",
    "the very good agrement between the numerical and analytical results shown in fig .",
    "5 proves that the typical amplitude of the fluctuation , @xmath168 decays as @xmath169 where @xmath170 is given by ( [ main - epsilon ] ) .",
    "it also shows that the oscillatory behavior of @xmath171 is dictated by the oscillatory solutions of ( [ mu3 ] ) .",
    "our analytical results have been derived for weak disorder . in this",
    "limit the strength of the random component in the transition rates appears only through the prefactor which controls the magnitude of the fluctuation ( see eq .",
    "( [ avdseltasquare ] ) ) , while the functional dependence on time is independent of the @xmath28 and depends only on the intrinsic properties of the pure meiss - ott model . our numerical comparison , shown in fig .",
    "5 , has been also performed for weak disorder @xmath172 .",
    "it is , however , worthwhile to clarify to what extent these results depend on the value of @xmath28 . .",
    "to this end we compute @xmath171 for various values of @xmath28 , between @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( notice that the higher value is not far from the upper limit of the widest possible uniform distribution for which @xmath175 ) .    the functions @xmath176 are presented in fig .",
    "the fact that they almost collapse on the same graph , implies that our results are almost independent of the strength of the random component of the transition rates .",
    "finally it is instructive to compare our results with those of the true dynamics of mixed chaotic systems . for this purpose",
    "we study an ensemble of chaotic maps obtained by adding a small random component to the standard map : @xmath177 here @xmath178 is the kicking strength , and @xmath179 is a gaussian random function with zero mean and periodic correlation @xmath180 the constant @xmath181 controls the strength of the random contribution , while @xmath182 is the correlation length of @xmath179 .",
    "thus each realization of @xmath179 corresponds to a slightly different symplectic map , which may be viewed as a different member of the random tree model . thus averaging over this ensemble",
    "is expected to have similar effects to averaging over the transition rates of the random tree model . for the numerical computation",
    "we choose @xmath183 which is much smaller than the largest value of @xmath178 , for which the unstable fixed point at @xmath184 and @xmath185 remains unstable .",
    "the initial points of the various trajectories of the particles , are chosen to be in the vicinity of this fixed point ( within a square of size @xmath186 ) , and the particle is assumed to leave the system when it crosses the line @xmath184 .",
    "we choose kicking strength @xmath187 , correlation length @xmath188 , and the calculation is performed using a quadruple precision .",
    "the map was iterated up to @xmath189 iterations , which is the range within which the results agree with those obtained by double precision . for each realization of the random function @xmath179",
    ", the survival probability was calculated using @xmath190 trajectories .",
    "the correlations of the fluctuation have been obtained by averaging over 260 different realizations of the random component .    in fig .",
    "7 we present the results for the fluctuations in the decay exponent , @xmath171 , as function of @xmath4 .",
    "this graph shows an oscillatory behavior of the fluctuations but with no apparent decay , namely @xmath191 .    ) versus time.,width=321 ]",
    "in this work we have extended the rate equation approach of meiss - and ott in order to calculate the functional behavior of the sample to sample fluctuations in the local decay exponent @xmath45 of the survival probability .",
    "our calculations were conducted within the leading order perturbation theory in the strength of the random component . in this limit , it has been shown that apart from the amplitude of the fluctuations in @xmath45 , their functional dependence on time is dictated by the intrinsic parameters of the meiss - ott model . moreover",
    ", our numerical study shows that this conclusion is valid also at strong disorder",
    ". our approach can not give the typical value of the random component , @xmath28 .",
    "however , numerical evidence from the study of mixed chaotic systems suggests that it is of order unity .",
    "if we also assume that the typical magnitude of the fluctuations in @xmath45 is characterized by the decay exponent @xmath192 , then even after a million iterations the typical fluctuation in @xmath45 is of order of one tenth .",
    "moreover , our numerical study of the ensemble of symplectic maps ( [ standard - map ] ) , does not show any sign of decay of the fluctuations .",
    "namely , within the limits of reliable numerical calculation it is difficult to obtain the asymptotic value of the decay exponent , @xmath3 ( as also evident from fig .",
    "1 ) . one may speculate that this is because the assumption that the random component in the transition rates is uncorrelated is not correct , and that its effect can not be considered to be perturbative .",
    "for instance it is plausible that strong and correlated random components may confine the dynamics , in the long time limit , to a very small number of branches of the tree model .",
    "this implies that self averaging is not effective and therefore fluctuations in the normalized return probability , @xmath143 do not decay in time , or in other words @xmath193 .",

    "very asymmetric model , @xmath195 and therefore @xmath168 does not decay in time .",
    "let us , finally , remark that the tree model of meiss and ott represents an uncontrolled phenomenological approximation of the exact dynamics which is based on the assumption that within the phase space region associated with a given state , the relaxation is much faster compared to the transition time to other states .",
    "the status of validity of this assumption , however , is unclear@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis corresponds to a worst case scenario were self averaging is effective , and even in this case we obtain that the fluctuations in return probability decay extremely slowly in time",
    ". thus the convergence of the survival probability , @xmath0 , to its asymptotic value is very slow .",
    "this explains the wide range of results for the decay exponent @xmath45 obtained by numerical studies [ 5 - 18 ] in the last three decades .",
    "we thank avraham klein and shmuel fishman for valuable comments on this work .",
    "this research has been supported in part by the israel science foundation ( isf ) under grant 9/09 and by the united states - israel binational science foundation ( bsf ) grant no .",
    "in this appendix we derive the dispersion equation ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) which determines @xmath3 as well as the other exponents of the relaxation modes shown in fig .  3 .",
    "for this purpose we first derive an exact equation of the green function @xmath40 and then show that a solution of the form ( [ tildeexp ] ) leads to the dispersion equation .    from the master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) and from the definition of the green function ( [ gfdef ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 is a dummy parameter introduced for the expansion of the green function as a perturbation series , and should be set to one at the end of the calculation . in particular to the zeroth order in @xmath198 , @xmath199 where @xmath200 now let us expand the green function @xmath38 to all orders in @xmath198 . the diagrammatic representation of this expansion is presented in fig .",
    "the thick line represents the exact green function , thin lines represent the zeroth order green function , @xmath201 , and wiggly lines represent the product @xmath202 .",
    "notice that in this expansion wiggly lines can not cross because there are no loops on cayley trees .",
    "thus one may write an equation for the green function @xmath40 :    @xmath203    where the sum over @xmath204 is the over the nearest neighbors sites @xmath205 and @xmath206 , and @xmath207 denotes the green function on site @xmath208 assuming that if the particle reaches site @xmath209 it disappears . from the self similarity of the cayley tree it follows that @xmath207 and @xmath40 are related by a simple rescaling of time : @xmath210 thus the green function satisfies the equation : @xmath211 \\tilde{g}_{1,1}(s ) = 1 \\label{exactg11 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now substituting ( [ tildeexp ] ) into this equation gives in a straightforward manner equation for @xmath85 , @xmath212 a(0 ) = 1 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose solution is @xmath213 now substituting @xmath214 one obtains the equation @xmath215= 0   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to the dispersion equation ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) .",
    "in this appendix we compute the correlation function of two green functions @xmath216 .",
    "our main focus is the disconnected part of the correlator [ tgf - correlator ] , and we limit our considerations to the the lowest order perturbation theory in @xmath28 , for which the result is independent of the precise distribution of the random variables @xmath152 .    taking into account the random component of the transition rates we may write the equation for the green function in the form : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the addition to eq .",
    "( [ cgf - eq ] ) which comes from the random component of the transition rates .",
    "consider now the disconnected part of two green functions ( [ tgf - correlator ] ) .",
    "the general diagrams describing the leading order expansion of the average @xmath222 ( up to @xmath223 ) are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "solid lines represent the exact green function of the system without the random component , while dashed lines stand for pairs of random components of the transition rates given by ( [ wick s ] ) .    the first tree diagrams shown in panel ( a ) represent the disconnected part of the correlator @xmath224 , which is of no interest here and therefore to the leading order in @xmath28 , the connected part of the correlator @xmath225 is given by the diagram shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "the expansion on the right hand side of this panel refers to the point along the tree in which the random contribution is taken into account .",
    "the first diagram which will be denoted henceforth by @xmath226 corresponds to the case where the random contribution is taken into account along a bond from site `` 1 '' to one of its nearest neighbors sites .",
    "the next diagram represents the case where disorder is taken between site @xmath204 and its nearest neighbor sites , and so on .",
    "panel ( c ) of this figure shows the resummation of all these diagrams .",
    "from here it follows that      within the leading order in @xmath28 one may assume that the green functions satisfy the same scaling relation ( [ appaeq2 ] ) and therefore @xmath228 substituting this relation to ( [ resum1 ] ) and using definition ( [ defq ] ) one obtains eq .",
    "( [ q - eq ] ) .",
    "finally let us calculate the diagram @xmath229 whose explicit expansion is shown in fig .  10 . here",
