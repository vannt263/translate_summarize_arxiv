    "based on experimental evidence , dale s principle in neuroscience ( see for instance @xcite ) postulates that most neurons of a biological neuronal network send the same set of biochemical substances ( called neurotransmitters ) to the other neurons that are connected with them .",
    "most neurons release more than one neurotransmitter , which is called the co - transmission \" phenomenon @xcite , but _ the set _ of neurotransmitters is constant for each cell .",
    "nevertheless , during plastic phases of the nervous systems , the neurotransmitters that are released by certain groups of neurons change according to the development of the neuronal network .",
    "this plasticity allows the network perform diverse and adequate dynamical responses to external stimulus : evidence suggests that during both development ( in utero ) and the postnatal period , the neurotransmitter phenotype of neurons is plastic and can be adapted as a function of activity or various environmental signals  @xcite .",
    "also a certain phenotypic plasticity occurs in some cells of the nervous system of mature animals , suggesting that a dormant phenotype can be put in play by external inputs  @xcite . _ _    some mathematical models of the neuronal networks represent them as deterministic dynamical systems ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the dynamical evolution of the state of each neuron during the interspike intervals , and the dynamics of the bursting phenomenon , can be modelled by a finite - dimensional ordinary differential equation ( see for instance @xcite and in particular @xcite for a mathematical model of a neuron as a dynamical system evolving on a multi - dimensional space ) .",
    "when considering a network of many neurons , the synaptical connections are frequently modelled by impulsive coupling terms between the equations of the many cells ( see for instance @xcite ) . in such a mathematical model ,",
    "dale s principle is translated into the following statement :    * dale s principle : * _ each neuron is either inhibitory or excitatory .",
    "_ we recall that a neuron @xmath1 is called inhibitory ( resp .",
    "excitatory ) if its spikes produce , through the electro - biochemical actions that are transmitted along the axons of @xmath1 , only null or negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) changes in the membrane potentials of all the other neurons @xmath2 of the network .",
    "the amplitudes of those changes may depend on many variables .",
    "for instance , they may depend on the membrane instantaneous permeability of the receiving cell @xmath3 . but the sign of the postsynaptical actions is usually only attributed to the electro - chemical properties of the substances that are released by the sending cell @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "the sign depends only on the set of neurotransmitters that are released by @xmath1 .",
    "since this set of substances is fixed for each neuron @xmath1 ( if @xmath1 satisfies dale s principle ) , the sign of its synaptical actions on the other neurons @xmath2 is fixed for each cell @xmath1 , and thus , independent of the receiving neuron @xmath3 . _",
    "_    in this paper we adopt a simplified mathematical model of the neuronal network with a finite number @xmath0 of neurons , by means of a system of deterministic impulsive differential equations .",
    "this model is taken from @xcite , with an adaptation that allows the state variable @xmath4 of each cell @xmath1 be multidimensional .",
    "precisely @xmath4 is a vector of finite dimension , or equivalently , a point in a finite - dimensional manifold of an euclidean space .",
    "the finite dimension of the state variable @xmath4 is larger or equal than 1 , and besides , may depend on the neuron @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamical model of the network is the solution of a system of impulsive differential equations .",
    "this dynamics evolves on a product manifold whose dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the state variables of its @xmath5 neurons .",
    "we do not assume a priori that the neurons of the network satisfy dale s principle .",
    "in theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] we prove this principle a posteriori , as a necessary final consequence of a dynamical optimization process .",
    "we assume that during this process , a plastic phase of the neuronal network occurs , eventually changing the total numbers of neurons and synaptical connections , but such that the graph - scheme of the synaptic connections among _ groups of mutually identical cells _",
    "remains unchanged .",
    "we assume that a maximal amount of dynamical richness is pursued during such a plastic development of the network .",
    "then , by means of a rigourous deduction from the abstract mathematical model , we prove that , among all the mathematically theoretic networks @xmath6 of such a model , _ those exhibiting an optimal dynamics ( i.e. the richest or the most versatile dynamics ) necessarily satisfy dale s principle _ ( theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] ) . _ _ _ _    the mathematical criteria to decide the dynamical optimization is the following : first , in definition [ definitionequivalentnetworks ] , we classify all the theoretic neuronal networks ( also those that hypothetically do not satisfy dale s principle ) into non countably many equivalence classes . each class is a family of mutually equivalent networks , with respect to their internal synaptical connections among groups of cells ( we call those groups of cells _ synaptical units _ in definition [ definitionsynapticalunit ] ) .",
    "second , in definitions [ definitionrichernetwork ] and [ definitiondynamicaloptimum ] , we agree to say that a network @xmath6 has an _ optimal dynamics conditioned to its class , _ if the dynamical system modelling any other network @xmath7 in the same class as @xmath6 , has a space of orbits in the future that _ is a subset _ of the space of orbits of @xmath6 . in other words , @xmath6 is the network capable to perform the richest dynamics , namely , the most diverse set of possible evolutions in the future among all the networks that are in the same class . _ _ _ _ _ _    * results to be proved : *    in * theorem [ theoremexistenceofoptimalnetworks ] * we prove that _ the theoretic dynamical optimum exists _ in any equivalence class of networks that have isomorphic synaptical graphs . _ _    in * main theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] * we prove that such an _ optimum is achieved only if the network @xmath6 satisfies dale s principle . _ _ _    in * main theorem [ theoremcounterexample ] * we prove that the converse of theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] is false : _",
    "dale s principle is not sufficient for a network exhibit the optimal dynamics _ within its synaptical equivalence class . _",
    "_    the results are abstract and theoretically deduced from the mathematical model .",
    "they are epistemologically suggestive since they give a possible answer to the following question :    * epistemological question : * _ why _ does dale s principle hold for most cells in the nervous systems of animals ? _",
    "_    mathematically , the hypothesis of searching for an optimal dynamics implies ( through theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] ) that at some step of the optimization process all the cells must satisfy dale s principle .",
    "in other words , this principle would be a consequence , instead of a cause , of an optimization process during the plastic phase of the network .",
    "this conclusion holds under the hypothesis that the dynamical optimization ( i.e. the maximum dynamical richness ) is one of the natural  pursued aims during a certain changeable development of the network .",
    "finally , we notice that the converse of theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] is false : there exist mathematical examples of simple abstract networks whose cells satisfy dale s principle but are not dynamically optimal ( theorem [ theoremcounterexample ] ) .",
    "thus , dale s principle is necessary but not sufficient for the dynamical optimization of the network .",
    "* structure of the paper and purpose of each section : *    in section [ sectionmodel ] we write the hypothesis of main theorems [ theoremdaleprinciple ] and [ theoremcounterexample ] . from section [ sectiongraph&layers ] to [ sectiondaleprinciple ] we prove main theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] . the proof is developed in four steps , one in each separate section .",
    "the first step ( section [ sectiongraph&layers ] ) is devoted to prove the intermediate result of proposition [ propositionunits ] .",
    "the second step ( section [ sectionequivalentnetworks ] ) is deduced from proposition [ propositionunits ] .",
    "the third step ( section [ sectiondynamicaloptimum ] ) is logically independent from the first and second steps , and is devoted to obtain the two intermediate results of proposition [ propositionnumberofneuronslarger ] and theorem [ theoremexistenceofoptimalnetworks ] .",
    "section [ sectiondaleprinciple ] exposes the fourth step ( the end ) of the proof of main theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] , from the logic junction of the previous three steps , using the intermediate results ( propositions [ propositionunits ] and [ propositionnumberofneuronslarger ] , and theorem [ theoremexistenceofoptimalnetworks ] ) .    on the one hand , the intermediate results ( propositions [ propositionunits ] and [ propositionnumberofneuronslarger ] , and theorem [ theoremexistenceofoptimalnetworks ] ) are _ necessary stages _ in the logical process of our proof of main theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] which ends in section [ sectiondaleprinciple ] .",
    "in fact , theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] establishes that , _ if there exists _ a dynamical optimum within each synaptical equivalence class of networks , this optimal network necessarily satisfies dale s principle . but this result would be void if we did not prove ( as an intermediate step ) , that a dynamically optimal network exists ( theorem [ theoremexistenceofoptimalnetworks ] )",
    ". it would be also void if we did not prove that the synaptical equivalence classes of networks exist ( definition [ definitionequivalentnetworks ] ) .",
    "the synaptical equivalence classes of networks could not been defined if the inter - units graph of the network did not existed ( definition [ definitioninter - unitsgraph ] ) .",
    "and these graph exists as an immediate corollary of proposition [ propositionunits ] .",
    "so , proposition [ propositionunits ] must be proved as an intermediate step for our final purpose .",
    "finally , the end of the proof of main theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] argues by contradiction : if the dynamically optimal network did not satisfy dale s principle , then proposition [ propositionnumberofneuronslarger ] would be false .",
    "so , we need first , also as an intermediate step , to prove proposition [ propositionnumberofneuronslarger ] . _ _ _ _    on the other hand , to prove all the required intermediate results , we need some other ( previous ) mathematical statements from which we deduce the intermediate results .",
    "so , we start posing all the previous mathematical statements ( obtaining them from the general hypothesis of section [ sectionmodel ] ) , in a series of mathematical definitions , comments and remarks that are at the beginning of sections [ sectiongraph&layers ] , [ sectionequivalentnetworks ] and [ sectiondynamicaloptimum ] .    in section [ sectioncounterexample ]",
    ", we end the proof of main theorem [ theoremcounterexample ] stating that dale s principle is not sufficient for the dynamical optimization .",
    "its final statement is proved by applying directly some of the definitions , intermediate results and examples of sections [ sectiongraph&layers ] , [ sectionequivalentnetworks ] and [ sectiondynamicaloptimum ] ( in particular , those of figures [ figure1 ] , [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sectionconclusions ] we write the conclusions obtained from all the mathematical results that are proved along the paper .",
    "we assume a simplified ( but very general ) mathematical model of the neuronal network which is defined along this section .",
    "the model , up to an abstract reformulation , and a generalization that allows any finite dimension for the impulsive differential equation governing each neuron , is taken from @xcite and @xcite . in the following subsections",
    "we describe the mathematical assumptions of this model :      each neuron @xmath1 , while it does not receive synaptical actions from the other cells of the network , and while its membrane potential is lower than a ( maximum ) _ threshold level @xmath8 , _ and larger than a lower bound @xmath9 , is assumed to be governed by a finite - dimensional differential equation of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is time , @xmath4 is a finite - dimensional vector @xmath12 whose components are real variables that describe the instantaneous state of the cell @xmath1 , and @xmath13 is a lipschitz continuous function giving the velocity vector @xmath14 of the changes in the state of the cell @xmath1 , as a function of its instantaneous vectorial value @xmath15 .",
    "the function @xmath16 is the so called _ vector field _ in the phase space of the cell @xmath1 .",
    "this space is assumed to be a finite dimensional _",
    "compact _ manifold .",
    "the advantages of considering that @xmath17 ( not necessarily 1 ) are , among others , the possibility of showing dynamical bifurcations between different rythms and oscillations that appear in some biological neurons @xcite , that would not appear if the mathematical model of all the neurons were necessarily one - dimensional . _ _ _ _ _ _    one of the components of the vectorial state variable @xmath4 ( which with no loss of generality we take as the first component @xmath18 ) is the instantaneous membrane potential @xmath19 of the cell @xmath1 .    in the sequel , we denote @xmath20 and @xmath21    in addition to the differential equation ( [ eqn001 ] ) , it is assumed the following * spiking condition * @xcite : if there exists an instant @xmath22 such that the potential @xmath23 equals the _ threshold level _ @xmath24 , then @xmath25 . in brief , the following logic assertion holds , by hypothesis : _",
    "_    @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the reset value .",
    "it is normalized to be zero after a change of variables , if necessary , that refers the difference of membrane potential of the cell @xmath1 to the reset value .",
    "a more realistic model would consider a positive relatively short time - delay @xmath28 between the instant @xmath22 when the membrane potential arrives to the threshold level @xmath24 , and the instant @xmath29 for which the potential takes its reset value @xmath27 . during this short time - delay",
    ", the membrane potential shows an abrupt pulse of large amplitude , which is called _ spike _ of the neuron @xmath1 .",
    "the impulsive simplified model approximates the spike to an abrupt discontinuity jump , by taking the time - delay @xmath28 equal to zero .",
    "then , the spike becomes an instantaneous jump of the membrane potential @xmath30 from the level @xmath31 to the reset value @xmath27 which occurs at @xmath32 according to condition ( [ eqn002 ] ) . _ _",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the dirac delta supported on @xmath24 .",
    "namely @xmath34 ( via the abstract integration theory with respect to the dirac delta probability measure ) denotes a discontinuity step @xmath35 that occurs on the potential @xmath30 at each instant @xmath36 such that @xmath37 . in other words : @xmath38 and so @xmath39    after the above notation is adopted , the dynamics of each cell @xmath1 ( while isolated from the other cells of the network ) is modelled by the following impulsive differential equation : @xmath40 in the above equality @xmath41 is the jump vector with dimension equal to the dimension of the state variable @xmath4 .",
    "namely , at each spiking instant , only the first component @xmath18 ( the membrane potential ) is abruptly reset , since the jump vector has all the other components equal to zero .",
    "strictly talking , the equation ( [ eqn003 ] ) is not a differential equation , but the hybrid between the differential equation @xmath42 plus a rule , denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "this impulsive rule imposes a discontinuity jump of amplitude vector @xmath44 in the dependence of the state variable @xmath15 on @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 is not continuous , and thus it is not indeed differentiable .",
    "it is in fact discontinuous at each instant @xmath32 such that @xmath37 , i.e. when the dirac delta @xmath45 is not null .",
    "nevertheless , the theory of impulsive differential equations follows similar rules than the theory of ordinary differential equations .",
    "it was early initiated by milman and myshkis @xcite , cited in @xcite . in particular , the existence and uniqueness of solution for each initial condition , and theorems of stability , still hold for the impulsive differential equation ( [ eqn003 ] ) , as if it were an ordinary differential equation @xcite .",
    "the synaptical interactions are modelled by the following rule : if the membrane potential @xmath18 of some neuron @xmath1 arrives to ( or exceeds ) its threshold level @xmath24 at instant @xmath22 , then the cell @xmath1 sends an action @xmath46 to the other neurons @xmath2 .",
    "in particular @xmath46 may be zero if no synaptical connection exists from the cell @xmath1 to the cell @xmath3 .",
    "this action produces a discontinuity jump in the membrane potential @xmath47 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the signed amplitude of the discontinuity jump on the membrane potential @xmath49 of the neuron @xmath3 , which is produced by the synaptical action from the neuron @xmath1 , when @xmath1 spikes .",
    "the real value @xmath48 may depend on the instantaneous state @xmath50 of the receiving neuron @xmath3 just before the synaptic action from neuron @xmath1 arrives . for simplicity we do not explicitly write this dependence .",
    "thus , the symbol @xmath48 denotes a real function of @xmath50 , which we assume to be either identically null or with constant sign .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 the discontinuity jump vector , with dimension equal to the dimension of the variable state @xmath50 of the cell @xmath3 . in other words , the discontinuity jump in the instantaneous vector state @xmath50 of the cell @xmath3 , that is produced when the cell @xmath1 spikes , is null on all the components of @xmath50 except the first one @xmath47 , i.e. except on the membrane potential of the neuron @xmath3 . in formulae : @xmath52 thus , the dynamics of the whole neuronal network is modelled by the following system of impulsive differential equations : @xmath53 where @xmath5 is the number of cells in the network .",
    "[ definitionexcitinhibitmixed ] * ( excitatory , inhibitory and mixed neurons ) * _ the synapses from cell @xmath1 to @xmath3 is called excitatory if @xmath54 and it is called inhibitory if @xmath55 .",

    "a neuron @xmath1 is called _ excitatory _ ( resp .",
    "_ inhibitory _ _ ) if @xmath57 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) for all @xmath3 such that @xmath58 .",
    "the cell @xmath1 is called _ mixed _ if it is neither excitatory nor inhibitory .",
    "dale s principle ( which we do not assume a priori to hold ) states that no neuron is mixed .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    [ remarknoindifferentcells ] _ it is not restrictive to assume that no cell @xmath1 is _ indifferent _ _ , namely no cell @xmath1 sends null synaptical actions to all the other cells , i.e. _ _ _ _    @xmath59    in fact , if there existed such a cell @xmath1 , it would not send any action to the other cells of the network @xmath6 .",
    "so , the global dynamics of the network is not modified ( except for having one less variable ) if we take out the cell @xmath1 from @xmath6 .    _ all along the paper we assume that the network @xmath6 has at least 2 neurons and no neuron is indifferent . _ _ _      to obtain a well defined deterministic dynamics from the system ( [ eqn005 ] ) , other complementary assumptions are adopted by the model .",
    "first , a * refractory phenomenon * ( see for instance @xcite ) is considered as follows : if some fixed neuron @xmath3 spikes at instant @xmath22 , then its potential @xmath47 is reset to zero becoming indifferent to the synaptical actions that it may receive ( at the same instant @xmath22 ) from the other neurons .",
    "second , if for some fixed neuron @xmath3 at some instant @xmath22 , the sum @xmath60 of the excitatory actions that @xmath3 simultaneously receives from the other neurons of the network , is larger or equal than @xmath61 , then @xmath3 itself spikes at instant @xmath22 , regardless whether @xmath62 or not . in this case , at instant @xmath22 the cell @xmath3 sends synaptical actions @xmath63 to the other neurons @xmath64 of the network , and then , the respective potentials @xmath65 will suffer a jump @xmath63 at instant @xmath22 .",
    "this process may make new neurons @xmath64 to spike in an * avalanche process * ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this avalanche is produced instantaneously , when some excitatory neuron spontaneously arrived to its threshold level .",
    "but due to the refractory rule , once each neuron spikes , its membrane potential refracts all the excitations or inhibitions that come at the same instant .",
    "so , the avalanche phenomenon is produced instantaneously , _ but includes each neuron @xmath1 at most once .",
    "_ then , each interaction term @xmath66 in the sum at right of equation ( [ eqn005 ] ) is added only once at each spiking instant @xmath22 . _ _",
    "the purpose of this section is to prove proposition [ propositionunits ] and to state the existence of an inter - units graph  ( definition [ definitioninter - unitsgraph ] ) .",
    "these are intermediate results ( the first step ) of the proof of main theorems [ theoremdaleprinciple ] and [ theoremcounterexample ] .",
    "we will prove these intermediate results by logical deduction from several previous statements and hypothesis .",
    "so , we start by including the needed previous statements in the following series of mathematical definitions :    let @xmath6 be a network of @xmath0 neurons , according to the model defined in section [ sectionmodel ] .",

    "we deduce that the synaptical interaction jumps @xmath329 that @xmath154 receives from any other neuron @xmath330 coincides with the synaptical interaction jumps @xmath331 that @xmath325 receives from @xmath332 in the network @xmath6 . therefore , both @xmath154 and @xmath333 satisfy the same impulsive differential equation ( [ eqn005 ] ) .",
    "besides , their respective initial conditions @xmath286 and @xmath334 coincide , due to equality ( [ eqn008 ] ) . since the solution of the impulsive differential equation ( [ eqn005 ] ) that satisfies a specified initial condition is unique , we deduce the following statement :    _ for any instant @xmath335 the state @xmath336 coincides with the instantaneous state @xmath337 , where @xmath325 . _ _ _    recalling definition [ definitiondynamicsofn ] of the dynamics @xmath231 and @xmath243 of the networks @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , we deduce : @xmath338 @xmath339 applying again equality ( [ eqn008 ] ) , which defines the mapping @xmath257 for each fixed instant @xmath262 as the new initial state , we conclude @xmath340 proving equality ( [ eqn006 ] ) , as wanted .    we have proved that @xmath249 for all @xmath275 .",

    "theorem [ theoremcounterexample ] is the second main theorem of the paper .",
    "its proof is deduced from the intermediate results that were previously obtained along the paper , and is ended by showing the explicit counter - example from figures [ figure1 ] , [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] .    [ theoremcounterexample ] * ( dale s principle is not sufficient for the dynamical optimization ) *    there exist neuronal networks according to the mathematical model of section _ [ sectionmodel ] _ that satisfy dale s principle and are not dynamically optimal conditioned to their respective synaptical equivalence classes . _ _    _ end of the proof of theorem _ [ theoremcounterexample ] : we will show an explicit example of a dynamical _ suboptimal _ network @xmath6 within a synaptical equivalence class @xmath215 , such that @xmath6 _ satisfies _ dale s principle .",
    "we will exhibit such an example with @xmath360 neurons , but it can be repeated ( after obvious adaptations ) with any arbitrarily chosen number @xmath361 .",
    "_ _ _ _    consider the network @xmath6 of figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "assume , for instance , the following signs for the nonzero synaptical interactions :    @xmath362 for @xmath363 ,    @xmath364 for @xmath365 ,    @xmath366 , @xmath367 , @xmath368 .",
    "then , the neurons @xmath110 and @xmath87 are excitatory and the neurons @xmath369 and @xmath88 are inhibitory .",
    "thus , all the neurons of the network @xmath6 satisfy dale s principle .    as shown in section [ sectionequivalentnetworks ] , the network @xmath7 of figure [ figure3 ] is synaptically equivalent to the network @xmath6 of figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "in other words , both networks @xmath6 and @xmath7 belong to the same equivalence class @xmath215 . since @xmath7 has exactly 6 neurons and @xmath6 has 5 neurons ,",
    "applying proposition [ propositionnumberofneuronslarger ] we deduce that @xmath370 .",
    "thus @xmath6 is not the optimal network of its class @xmath215 . @xmath169",
    "in section [ sectionmodel ] we posed the mathematical simplified ( but general ) model of biological neuronal networks , by a system ( [ eqn005 ] ) of deterministic impulsive differential equations . in its essence , this model was taken from @xcite ( some particular conditions of the model were also taken from @xcite and from the bibliography therein ) .",
    "on the one hand , the mathematical model is an idealized simplification of the network , because the spiking of each neuron is reduced to an instantaneous reset , without delay , of its membrane potential .",
    "also the synaptical actions are assumed to be instantaneous and have no delay .    on the other hand ,",
    "the abstract mathematical model is general , since we require neither particular formulae , nor numerical specification , nor computational algorithms for the functions @xmath16 , @xmath371 and @xmath48 of equations ( [ eqn001 ] ) , ( [ eqn003 ] ) and ( [ eqn005 ] ) , nor specific values for the parameters .",
    "in section [ sectiongraph&layers ] we defined the homogeneous parts of the network , composed by mutually identical cells .",
    "the groups of neurons , which we call synaptical units , are formed by structurally identical and synaptically representative neurons . in proposition [ propositionunits ]",
    "we proved that any neuronal network , according to the mathematical model described in section [ sectionmodel ] , is decomposable in more than one homogeneous part , and that each homogeneous part is decomposable into pairwise disjoint dynamical units .",
    "then , a simplified graph , which we called inter - units graph  mathematically represents the statical structure of the synaptical connections among the groups of neurons in the network .",
    "this theoretical approach have rough similitudes with empirical research in neuroscience @xcite , for which the structure of synaptical connections among groups of neurons or regions in the brain is studied , regardless how many neurons exactly compose each region .    in section [ sectionequivalentnetworks ]",
    "we conditioned the study to a fixed family of networks that are mutually synaptically equivalent .",
    "we denote this family by @xmath215 , and call it a class .",
    "even if this condition may appear as a restriction , it is not .",
    "in fact , first , any neuronal network ( provided that it is mathematically modelled by the equations of section [ sectionmodel ] ) , belongs to one such a class @xmath215 .",
    "second , all the results that we proved along the paper stand for any arbitrarily chosen class @xmath215 of synpatically equivalent networks .",
    "each class @xmath215 of synaptically equivalent networks gives a particular specification for the number of synaptical units and for the inter - units graph .",
    "this specification implies a particular statical anatomy  in the synaptical structure of the network , described by the different groups of mutually identical neurons ( and not by the neurons themselves ) .",
    "each group of neurons is a synaptical unit that has a characteristic functional role in the complex synaptical structure of the network .",
    "roughly speaking , a class @xmath215 of mutually synaptically equivalent neuronal networks works as an abstraction of the following analogous example : when a neuroscientist studies the nervous system of certain species of animals , he is investigating _ a class of neuronal networks _ composed by a relatively large amount of particular cases that are indeed different networks ( one particular case for each individual of the same species ) .",
    "but all the neuronal networks in that class share a certain structure , which is given , for instance , by the genetic neurological characteristics of the species .",
    "some type of synaptical connections between particular _ groups _ of neurons with specific physiological roles , is shared by all the healthy individuals of the species . however , the exact number of neurons , and the exact number and weight of synaptical connections between particular neurons , may vary from one individual to another of the same species , or from an early age to a mature age of the same individual .",
    "_ _ _ _    in section [ sectiondynamicaloptimum ] we studied the abstract dynamical system of any neuronal network defined by the mathematical model of section [ sectionmodel ] , and conditioned to a certain fixed class @xmath215 of mutually synaptically equivalent networks . in theorem [ theoremexistenceofoptimalnetworks ] we proved that ( theoretically ) a dynamically optimal network exists in each class @xmath215 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theoremexistenceofoptimalnetworks ] is constructive : first , we defined a particular network @xmath216 , and second , we proved that @xmath6 is the richest network of its class .",
    "this means that @xmath6 would potentially exhibit the most diverse set of dynamical responses ( orbits in the future ) when external signals change the instantaneous state of some of its neurons .",
    "since the system is assumed to be deterministic , any network according to this model will reproduce a unique response if the same instantaneous state occurs for _ all _ its neurons .",
    "so , the space of responses is represented by the space of instantaneous states ( or initial states , if time @xmath372 is translated to become 0 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this space may change from one network to another of the same synaptical equivalence class @xmath215 .",
    "if we assumed that the natural pursued aim  in the development of a biological neuronal network were to optimize the space of dynamical responses under stimulus , preserving the same characteristic and functional structure between groups of cells , then , theoretically , the final ( but maybe never arrived ) network would be @xmath6 , constructed in the proof of theorem [ theoremexistenceofoptimalnetworks ] . _ _    in section [ sectiondaleprinciple ] we proved theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] , which is one of the main results of the paper .",
    "it states that the dynamically optimal network @xmath373 in the class @xmath215 must satisfy dale s principle ( i.e. all its neurons are either excitatory or inhibitory but not mixed ) .",
    "so , if the natural pursued aim in the development of the neuronal network were to optimize the space of possible dynamical responses , then the tendency of the network during its plastic phases will provoke that as many neurons as possible satisfy dale s principle . from this point of view , theorem [ theoremdaleprinciple ] shows that dale s principle is a consequence of an optimization process .",
    "so , it gives a mathematically possible answer to the following epistemological question :      mathematical answer : because maybe biological networks evolve pursuing the theoretical optimum or richest dynamics , conditioned to preserve the synaptical connections among its different homogeneous groups of neurons .",
    "finally , in theorem [ theoremcounterexample ] we proved that dale s principle is not enough for the neuronal network be a dynamical optimum within its synaptically equivalence class . in other words , dale s principle would be just a stage of a plastic optimization process of the neuronal network , but its validity does not ensure that the end of that hypothetical process of optimization has been arrived .      the author thanks the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions ,",
