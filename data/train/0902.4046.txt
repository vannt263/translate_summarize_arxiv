    "<S> the electromagnetic properties of the baryon decuplet are calculated in quenched qcd on a @xmath0 lattice with a lattice spacing of 0.128  fm using the fat - link irrelevant clover ( flic ) fermion action with quark masses providing a pion mass as low as 300  mev . magnetic moments and charge radii </S>",
    "<S> are extracted from the electric and magnetic form factors for each individual quark sector . from these , the corresponding baryon properties are constructed . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for the higher order moments of the spin-3/2 baryons , including the electric quadrupole moment @xmath1 and the magnetic octupole moment @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the world s first determination of a non - zero @xmath2 form factor for the @xmath3 baryon is presented . with these results </S>",
    "<S> we provide a conclusive analysis which shows that decuplet baryons are deformed . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the decuplet baryon results from a similar lattice calculation of the octet baryons . </S>",
    "<S> we establish that the environment sensitivity is far less pronounced in the case of the decuplet baryons compared to that in the octet baryons . </S>",
    "<S> a surprising result is that the charge radii of the decuplet baryons are generally smaller than that of the octet baryons . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moment of the @xmath4 reveals a turn over in the low quark mass region , making it smaller than the proton magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the expectations of quenched chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> a similar turn over is also noticed in the magnetic moment of the @xmath5 , but not for @xmath6 where only kaon loops can appear in quenched qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the electric quadrupole moment of the @xmath7 baryon is positive when the negative charge factor is included , and is equal to @xmath8 , indicating an oblate shape . </S>"
