    "the standard model ( sm ) has been a successful model and the only missing piece of it is the higgs boson . in the recent experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the discovery of a higgs - like particle has been reported @xcite . as of now the discovery at the lhc",
    "does not imply that it is a higgs boson of the sm and it could even belong to the physics beyond the sm",
    ". on going studies at the lhc will confirm this in future .",
    "as for the physics beyond the sm , several motivations have been given @xcite .",
    "the important motivations among these are the gauge hierarchy problem , smallness of neutrino masses , existence of dark matter , etc .",
    "although there is a growing belief in the physics beyond the sm , the theoretical models in this category also have to deal with the constraints from the flavor violating processes . for a review on flavor violating processes , see ref .",
    "the sm has been consistent with all the flavor violating processes due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani cancellation mechanism , and this cancellation mechanism may not work in models of physics beyond the sm .    in this work ,",
    "we have been motivated by arguments for physics beyond the sm @xcite , especially related to neutrino masses @xcite . among the various models for non - zero neutrino masses ,",
    "type ii seesaw mechanism offers a viable model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the scalar triplet higgs with hypercharge @xmath3 can give majorana masses to neutrinos by acquiring a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to the neutral component of the triplet higgs .",
    "due to the seesaw mechanism @xcite , the vev of neutral triplet higgs can be as low as @xmath4 1 ev , provided the masses of these states are @xmath5 gev . as a result of this , for @xmath6 yukawa couplings the neutrino mass scale @xmath7 0.1 ev can be explained .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite has been proposed to solve the gauge hierarchy problem and it is one of the main contenders for new physics . to explore the models among the physics beyond the sm ,",
    "supersymmetrizing the type ii seesaw mechanism would be worth to do @xcite . in the supersymmetrized version of type ii seesaw model , both the scalar and fermionic states of triplet higgses will have super heavy masses of @xmath5 gev .",
    "a positive aspect of having super heavy masses to triplet higgs states is that the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes in both the non - susy and susy versions of type ii seesaw model would be suppressed and they can be within the experimental limits .",
    "a negative point in these models is that these heavy triplet states can not be produced at the lhc , and hence a direct detection is unlikely for the type ii seesaw mechanism . for indirect signals of super heavy triplet states ,",
    "hence , for phenomenological studies at the lhc , we consider a specific version of susy type - ii seesaw model , where we conceive tev scale masses for the triplet higgs states .    in the type ii seesaw model ,",
    "leptogenesis mechanism can be employed to explain the asymmetry between matter and anti - matter @xcite . in the non - susy version of type ii seesaw model , the recent indication of lhc experiment on the existence of higgs boson @xcite can also be accommodated @xcite . in these models",
    ", the triplet higgs states can induce lfv processes such as @xmath0 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc at tree level , and at 1-loop level decays like @xmath1 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can also happen . none of the above mentioned lfv decay processes have been observed in experiments and stringent experimental upper bounds have been put on the decay branching ratios of these processes @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the susy version of type ii seesaw model , the above mentioned lfv processes can get additional radiative contributions which are induced by slepton fields .",
    "these additional contributions due to slepton fields also exist in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in the mssm",
    ", the off - diagonal elements in soft masses of sleptons can generate lfv processes which are induced at 1-loop level . as a result of this",
    ", constraints on model parameters may be reduced in mssm as compared to that in type ii seesaw model .",
    "especially , we may expect stringent bounds in type ii seesaw model from processes such as @xmath0 which take place at tree level .    in the literature",
    ", some work has already been done on the lfv processes in the non - susy version of type ii seesaw model at tev scale @xcite . even in the susy version of type ii seesaw model at tev scale , some work has been done in this direction @xcite . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed study of constraints on model parameters arising from lfv processes has not been done .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model has been motivated from high scale physics , and due to renormalization group effects , off - diagonal elements in the slepton mass matrices can become non - zero at low energy scale . as a result of this , processes like @xmath1 can have additional contribution due to sletpon fields .",
    "in this work , we have confined to the susy version of type ii seesaw model at the low energy scale and assume zero off - diagonal elements in charged slepton and sneutrino mass matrices .",
    "more precisely , we assume off - diagonal elements to be zero in the soft mass - squared terms and also in the soft @xmath12-terms of the slepton fields .",
    "this assumption makes our work to be different from that in ref .",
    "moreover , in our considered model , the lfv processes can happen only due to the non - diagonal yukawa couplings of triplet higgs field with the lepton doublets .",
    "although we have neglected the contribution from slepton fields , the lfv processes in our work are clearly different from that of non - susy version of type ii seesaw model @xcite , since the fermionic partners of scalar triplet fields will give additional contribution to the lfv processes in our model .",
    "the lfv processes in our model dominantly depend on neutrino yukawa couplings and masses of triplet higgs states .",
    "the yukawa couplings can be determined from neutrino masses and mixing angles as well as from vev of scalar triplet higgs .",
    "we will show later that the vev of scalar triplet higgs can be around 1 ev in order to be compatible with neutrino oscillation data .",
    "hence , by determining the yukawa couplings , the experimental limits on lfv processes can put constraints on the masses of triplet higgs states .",
    "we have studied implications of these constraints on other observable quantities such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite and the decay patterns of scalar triplet higgses .",
    "since the triplet states have tev scale masses , they can be pair produced at the lhc and their decay products give us experimental signals of this model .",
    "we have found that the constraints from lfv processes can effect the decay channels of these fields .",

    "5 , we have described various decay channels of the scalar triplet higgs states and their branching ratios . in sec .",

    "( [ e : wii ] ) . to realize the possibility of @xmath53 1 ev , we can take the dimensionless parameters @xmath54 and the fermionic triplet higgs mass @xmath55 gev @xcite .",

    "we here , on the phenomenological grounds , consider a low energy setup of the above described susy type ii seesaw model .",
    "the implications of supersymmetry breaking is to generate soft terms of scalar potential in the low energy regime . for full form of the scalar potential of this model ,",
