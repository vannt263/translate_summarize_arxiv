    "atomically thin materials , organized in hexagonal honeycomb like geometry , have been through intense scrutiny due to their exceptional electronic properties , the most intriguing of which is , perhaps , the strong coupling between their quantized charge - density fluctuations , i.e. , plasmon modes , and light or other charged particles  @xcite . control and manipulation of the plasmon properties of these two - dimensional systems are expected to guide the design of next - generation nanophotonic and nanoelectronic devices , with the enhanced capability to operate from terahertz  ( thz ) to infrared  ( ir ) frequencies .",
    "fundamental research and technological applications have been historically focused on monolayer graphene  ( mg ) , after the discovery of its unique electronic , optical , thermal and mechanical properties  @xcite . among these",
    "are the fascinating features of the mg extrinsic plasmons , which have much stronger confinement , larger tunability and lower losses compared to gold and silver nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have thoroughly characterized the plasmon dispersions in mg and some other graphene - related materials , such as bilayer graphene  ( blg ) and graphene nanoribbons  ( gnrs ) organized in regular planar arrays  @xcite .",
    "further advances are expected from the analysis of nanocarbon - metal interfaces together with associated application developments in biological sensing , optical signal processing and quantum information technology  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the incompatibility of carbon - based materials with current silicon - based electronic makes them unsuitable for immediate use . for this reason ,",
    "other candidates among the group - iv elements , e.g. , silicon and germanium in honeycomblike geometries , have been explored  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "silicene has been recognized to have four principal advantages with respect to mg : ( i ) compatibility with current electronics , ( ii ) tunable band gap in presence of a perpendicular electric field  @xcite , or by hydrogenation  @xcite and fluorination  @xcite , ( iii ) experimental realization of quantum spin hall effect due to its stronger spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , and ( iv ) synthesis on various substrates with different electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "this and other beyond - graphene systems are expected to be good competitors with graphene - related materials , sharing with the latter controllable electronic properties for specific applications .",
    "a further support in this direction has been the fabrication of a first silicene - based field - effect - transistor  @xcite .    from the structural point of view , atomic resolved scanning tunneling microscopy  ( stm ) experiments , combined with density - functional calculations  @xcite , have demonstrated that silicene is characterized by a buckled honeycomb lattice where the sp@xmath5 hybridized orbitals get slightly dehybridized into sp@xmath6  like orbitals causing a weakening of the @xmath4 bonds .",

    "semiconducting substrates with large band gaps like h - bn turn out to be excellent candidates to adsorb pristine silicene , simply because no substrate states appear close to the fermi level and , accordingly , the interaction silicene - substrate can not perturb the dirac - cone structure .",
    "although the structural properties of pristine silicene are well established , a comprehensive approach and description of its plasmon properties at low and high energies , from the thz to ultraviolet  ( uv ) , has not been presented so far .",

    "these are counterparts to the well - known @xmath4 and @xmath4-@xmath7 plasmons found in mg , blg and graphite  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , mg , silicene and germanene have been proved to have the same infrared - frequency absorbance  @xcite , which is a universal feature of the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice and does not depend on the chemistry of the group - iv element , buckling parameter or hybridization state .",

    "[ exdef](c ) , [ exdef](d ) prove that the 2dp is a genuine collective oscillation in the no - sp - excitation region . on the other hand",
    "the ap mode lies outside this region , and the corresponding plasmon oscillation is always damped in the landau sense .",
    "we have presented a full tddft+rpa analysis of the dielectric properties and plasmon dispersion of intrinsic and extrinsic silicene in freestanding form .",
    "the energy - loss spectra of intrinsic silicene have singled out two interband plasmon structures , lying at energies above 1.5  ev , which resembles the @xmath4 and @xmath4-@xmath7 modes of mg .",
    "the low @xmath94 features of the plasmon peaks have been found in agreement with previous absorbance calculations  @xcite .",
    "a more careful analysis has revealed that the @xmath4  like plasmon of silicene is assisted by sp processes between hybridized sp@xmath17 and sp@xmath18 states , connecting the @xmath4 band to the @xmath13 and @xmath145  like bands .",
    "this generates a double energy - momentum dispersion , which is more clearly resolved for momentum transfers along @xmath146 .",
    "these characteristics are consequence of the hybridized states of silicene , detectable in its ground - state band structure , and are expected to occur also in other buckled two - dimensional materials in honeycomb geometry , such as germanene .    at lower energies ( below @xmath19  ev ) , the energy - loss spectra of extrinsic silicene show two distinct oscillations , whose relative strength can be modulated by the doping concentration of injected or ejected electrons . similarly to mg , silicene presents a two - dimensional plasmon , which shares many common features with the plasmon mode of a two - dimensional electron gas , plus an acoustic mode , being observable only along specific directions of the incident momentum .",
    "the two modes may be seen as being generated by two different types of charge carriers , i.e. , dirac electrons moving with distinct fermi velocities .",
    "our findings suggest that the 2dp and ap modes exist in other two - dimensional materials in honeycomb lattice , such as germanene , making this features independent on the chemistry of the group - iv element , buckling parameter , or hybridization state .",
    "more importantly , they support the argument that silicene - based nanomaterials are excellent options for the design of next - generation nanodevices , in competition with graphene - based nanomaterials .",
