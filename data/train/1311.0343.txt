    "the _ guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement _ ( the _ guide _ or gum ) gives a practical procedure for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty .",
    "that procedure is based around the idea of adding individual estimates of variances to obtain an estimate of overall measurement variance and then combining the numbers of ` degrees of freedom ' for the individual estimates to obtain an effective number of degrees of freedom for this overall estimate .",
    "the _ guide _ s procedure is only applicable with one - dimensional quantities , which in this paper we will call ` scalars ' , but there are a number of areas of metrology that must deal with multidimensional quantities also .",
    "perhaps the most common involve complex - valued quantities , which arise in association with wave phenomena in fields such as acoustics , optics and electrical metrology .",
    "in particular , metrology at radio and microwave frequencies ( rf ) is often concerned with measuring reflection and transmission coefficients when electromagnetic waves propagate in a network of components .",
    "standard rf instrumentation can be used to accumulate simultaneous measurements of several such coefficients to form a sample of data . when the measurand is related to a number of these coefficients ,",
    "subsequent data processing will use the sample data to obtain the measurement result , and the associated sample variances and covariances should be used to evaluate the measurement uncertainty .",
    "this paper describes a method for calculating the number of effective degrees of freedom in such cases , so that a region of expanded uncertainty can be evaluated .    when the measurand is a scalar estimated by averaging @xmath0 replicated measurement results , the procedure of the _ guide _ involves forming a confidence interval using the @xmath1-distribution with @xmath2 degrees of freedom , as in the classical statistical approach to estimating the mean of a normal distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* clause 4.2.3 , note 1 ) . the general problem addressed in the _ guide _ ,",
    "however , involves a measurand that is a function of many scalars , with this function being locally approximately linear .",
    "the uncertainty of measurement is then analogous to the uncertainty in the estimate of the weighted sum of many scalars . in that case",
    "there is no @xmath1-distribution from which we can construct an exact confidence interval , so the _ guide _ advocates a method that uses a @xmath1-distribution but is approximate .",
    "this method uses the welch - satterthwaite ( w - s ) formula to calculate the best number of degrees of freedom ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix g.4 ) .",
    "the w - s formula is derived and justified under the classical , i.e.  frequentist , approach to statistical analysis .",
    "it is applicable when the quantity of interest is the sum of scalars each independently estimated by averaging measurement results @xcite .",
    "therefore , the use of the w - s formula in metrology is most appropriate when the classical approach is adopted and when the dominant components of uncertainty are evaluated by type a methods .",
    "that is the primary context for extension of the _ guide _ methodology by generalization of the w - s formula .",
    "our analysis is firmly grounded within the classical statistical framework , in which the w - s formula applies .",
    "working in a non - classical context would involve a different formula as the starting point ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) .      as in the _ guide _ , the upper - case letters @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote unique unknown values of fixed scalar quantities and the lower - case letters @xmath5 and @xmath6 indicate known estimates of these quantities . similarly , upper - case bold letters like @xmath7 and @xmath8 and lower - case bold letters like @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote fixed vector quantities and their estimates .",
    "upright bold symbols such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 are used for matrices . in classical statistics an observation , say @xmath5 , is generally seen as the outcome of a random variable , and this random variable will often be denoted by the corresponding capital letter . however , because the symbol @xmath3 is being used for a different purpose in this paper , the random variable of which @xmath5 is the outcome will be denoted by @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "physicists tend to think in terms of the data , not the random variables that gave rise to the data , so there is merit in minimizing explicit reference to random variables .",
    "thus instead of writing @xmath14 , for example , to mean that the random variable @xmath13 _ possesses _ the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 4 , we will write @xmath15 to mean that to the number @xmath5 _ was drawn from _ the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 4 @xcite . should not be confused with the usage of wang , hannig and iyer @xcite .",
    "] similarly , instead of writing @xmath16 or @xmath17 to mean the variance of the random variable @xmath13 we will write @xmath18 or @xmath19 to describe the same quantity as the _ parent _ variance of @xmath5 .    the term ` measurement result ' is often used in metrology to represent the outcome of the measurement process .",
    "the basic context of the _ guide _ , and the context of this paper , is where the measurand has an essentially unique unknown value that is estimated or approximated in the measurement .",
    "so , in keeping with common statistical terminology , we will often describe a measurement result as an ` estimate ' .",
    "the foundation of the methodology to be discussed in this paper is the following result in multivariate statistical analysis .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 measurements are made of an unknown @xmath20-dimensional quantity @xmath7 and that the results are @xmath21},\\ldots,{\\pmb x}_{[n]}$ ] .",

    "that is , suppose @xmath28 } \\leftarrow { \\rm n}_{q}({\\pmb x},{\\boldsymbol\\sigma})$ ] .",
    "then @xmath9 is drawn from the multivariate normal distribution with mean vector @xmath7 and covariance matrix @xmath31 , while @xmath32 is independently drawn from the wishart distribution with scale matrix @xmath29 and @xmath2 degrees of freedom , which we denote by @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 being drawn independently .",
    "it follows that @xmath37 where @xmath38 signifies the distribution of hotelling s @xmath39 with @xmath2 degrees of freedom and second parameter @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the distribution @xmath40 is the distribution of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a random variable with the @xmath43-distribution with @xmath20 degrees of freedom in the numerator and @xmath44 degrees of freedom in the denominator .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the @xmath46-quantile of the distribution of @xmath47 .",
    "then , from ( [ hotelling ] ) , the ellipsoidal region of vectors @xmath48 described by the equation @xmath49 is the realization ( or outcome ) of a 95% confidence region for @xmath7 . in other words , whatever the values of the unknown parameters @xmath7 and @xmath29 , the overall procedure had probability 0.95 of generating a region containing @xmath7 .",
    "this procedure includes the steps of choosing @xmath0 without reference to the data , making the measurements and calculating the ellipsoid .",
    "the result just described is a standard result in multivariate statistics .",
    "the subject of this paper is the generalization of this result for situations of metrological interest .",
    "this process begins with a statement of the basic mathematical structure of a multidimensional measurement problem .",
