    "the first electromagnetic signature of a core - collapse sn is expected to occur when the explosion shock wave accelerates through the stellar envelope , and the radiation from the shock escapes and `` breaks out '' of the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "this radiative precursor to the sn explosion is expected to be the most luminous phase of a sn , and yet it is the least well observed .",
    "this is because the associated burst of radiation is brief ( 11000 sec ) and hot ( @xmath7 k ) @xcite , and _ precedes _ the optically - bright phase during which sne are typically discovered .",
    "these obstacles to discovery were surmounted with a bit of luck in a pointed x - ray observation of a galaxy in which a type ibc sn fortuitously exploded , and a several hundred second x - ray flash was detected @xcite , with a duration and spectral shape that was consistent with shock breakout into the thick wind of a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star progenitor @xcite .",
    "the presence of a thick wind is expected for a wr star , but it was also an important factor in stretching the shock breakout timescale long enough ( a factor of 100 longer than expected for shock breakout through the stellar surface ) to be easily detectable .",
    "in fact , there have been reports of shock breakout detections in type ii sne on the timescale of hours to several days @xcite , which require an unusual amount of circumstellar material in order to explain the timing of the events , either in the form of an extended stellar envelope inconsistent with stellar evolution models @xcite , or a vigorous , episodic mass - loss rate of @xmath8 yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a few of the earliest optical discoveries of core - collapse sne have caught the decline of the `` cooling envelope phase '' following shock breakout @xcite .",
    "observing the _ rise _ to peak of the cooling envelope emission is more desirable because it puts direct constraints on the radius of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "this thermal emission from the expanding shock - heated ejecta lasts only minutes in the soft x - rays , but peaks in the uv at hours up to a couple days after shock breakout @xcite . by the time the thermal emission peaks in the optical , other radiative processes dominate , i.e. radioactivity ( and hydrogen recombination in type ii sne ) .",
    "the timescales of the uv peak are more accessible to sn surveys , however , they still require observing the sn in the uv _ before _ it brightens in the optical , which can be days later . with _ galex _ we have attempted to circumvent this problem by coordinating wide - field monitoring in the uv with ground - based monitoring in the optical .",
    "the large radii of red supergiant ( rsg ) stars yield longer timescales and larger luminosities during shock breakout and its immediate aftermath , making them appealing for observational searches .",
    "stellar evolution calculations predict that rsg stars will explode as type iip sne @xcite , and type iip sne have been directly linked with rsg progenitors from pre - explosion imaging @xcite . indeed , the first early uv detections of sne were of two type iip sne , which were discovered serendipitously , from overlap between the _ galex _ deep imaging survey and the cfht supernova legacy survey @xcite .",
    "the first planned uv and optical joint survey effort , the _ galex _ time domain survey @xcite in the @xmath2 , was coordinated with the optical pan - starrs1 medium deep survey ( ps1 mds ) , and yielded the early detection of the rise to peak of uv emission from a type iip sn at @xmath9 with a cadence of 2 days .",
    "the early uv peak was well fitted by cooling envelope emission from the explosion of a red supergiant ( rsg ) with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "while the _ galex _ observations caught the rise to the peak of the cooling envelope emission , the shock breakout itself was not resolved by the relatively coarse time sampling of the observations compared to the expected shock breakout duration ( @xmath11hr ) .",
    "@xcite present a shallower , wide - field joint @xmath2 _ galex _ and optical palomar transient factory ( ptf ) survey which detected 7 core - collapse sne in the uv with a 3 day cadence .",
    "their observed detection rate is consistent with core - collapse sn rates combined with a fiducial model for cooling envelope emission from rsg stars .",
    "however , again their cadence was not sufficient to catch the short - lived shock breakout signal .",
    "here we present the results from a high - cadence monitoring program with _",
    "galex _ which increased the time sampling of the _ galex _ time domain survey and galex / ptf survey by a factor of two and three , respectively , and has yielded the first potential detection of the elusive shock breakout phase in a type iip sn , albeit with the requirement that the shock breakout occurred outside the progenitor s surface , in its circumstellar wind .",

    "however , such an extended , tenuous structure is better attributed to a circumstellar shell of material rather than the stellar envelope itself @xcite .",
    "the long duration of the uv burst suggests that either the shock is `` breaking out '' in a wind around the progenitor star , or it is associated with the post - shock - breakout cooling envelope emission previously detected in the uv in type iip sne with _ galex _ @xcite . in the following sections , we address both scenarios .",
    "+      in the cooling envelope scenario , the _ galex _ observations did not catch the brief radiative precursor from shock breakout , but rather the uv burst is from the adiabatically expanding shock - heated sn ejecta . as the hot envelope expands and cools , the peak energy of the thermal emission shifts from the soft x - rays into the uv when @xmath89 , where @xmath90 (or @xmath91  ev ) , causing a peak in the @xmath2 light curve .",

    "we conclude that the peak of the observed uv burst is more luminous than expected for the cooling envelope emission following shock breakout , and thus we now investigate whether the uv burst could be from the shock breakout pulse itself , but prolonged in time due to the presence of a circumstellar wind .",

    "the theoretical literature still refers to this phenomenon as the shock breakout @xcite , even though the energy deposited from the shock is diffusing out ( escaping ) into the wind , instead of the stellar envelope .",

    "the upper limit on @xmath110 from the observed rise time is consistent with the lack of excess thermal radiation in the optical bands at later times .",
    "@xcite model the light curves of type iip sne as a function of @xmath110 , and find that for @xmath150  yr@xmath6 , there is an observable excess in the uv and optical bands due to the conversion of the kinetic energy of the ejecta into thermal energy via interaction with the csm .",
    "the mass - loss rates in rsg inferred from spectroscopic studies range from @xmath151 yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus while the inferred mass - loss rate from the luminosity and duration of the shock breakout is on the high end of the observed distribution , these studies are sensitive to the time - averaged mass - loss rate , and do not sample short - lived , episodic enhanced mass - loss that may occur in pre supernova - rsgs @xcite , perhaps as a result of pulsation - driven superwinds @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", we do not have sufficient signal - to - noise in the spectrum of ps1 - 13arp to look for a high - velocity absorption feature or `` notch '' , predicted to be a signature of the excitation of ejecta by x - rays produced by circumstellar interaction @xcite .",
    "x - ray and radio observations of type iip sne also put conservative upper limits on the mass - loss rates of pre - sn rsgs to @xmath152 yr@xmath6 from the lack of thermal bremsstrahlung emission or synchrotron radiation from the interaction of the sn shock wave with the csm @xcite .",
    "radio and x - ray emission from type iip sn 1999em was interpreted as the result of circumstellar interaction with a stellar wind of @xmath153 yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "mass - loss rates should scale with rsg luminosity , and thus with stellar mass .",
    "@xcite were not able to put a direct constraint on the progenitor mass of ps1 - 13arp from the comparison of the bolometric light curve to hydrodynamic models , however they did infer a ejected nickel mass from a comparison of the late - time bolometric light curve of ps1 - 13arp to sn 1987a of @xmath154 .",
    "this amount of nickel is on the high - mass tail of the distribution for their sne iip sample , and could be indicative of a more massive progenitor rsg for ps1 - 13arp .",
    "another clue is the weak p - cygni absorption in the h@xmath24 profile of ps1 - 13arp at @xmath155 d. weak p - cygni absorption has been found in brighter than normal type iip sne , and explained by lower envelope masses and higher mass - loss rates @xcite .",
    "we present the joint _ galex _ uv and ps1 optical discovery of a type iip sn with a normal optical light curve , including the trademark plateau , preceded by a uv burst with the peak luminosity expected from shock breakout , but with a longer than expected duration .",
    "we rule out shock cooling emission from a compact bsg progenitor , and favor a shock breakout from a rsg with a high , but not extreme , amount of pre - sn mass - loss ( @xmath12 yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "this mass - loss rate is high enough to increase the height at which the sn shock breaks out to beyond the stellar surface , but not large enough to effect the optical light curve or spectrum measured weeks after the explosion . in particular , we do not detect narrow emission lines that could be powered by interaction with a dense csm ( from @xmath156 yr@xmath6 to @xmath157 yr@xmath6 ) as seen in type iin sne @xcite    however , we must caution that the theoretical models discussed here have yet to be verified in the normal case of shock breakout in the stellar envelope . in the case of type iip sn snls-04d2dc , the early _ galex _ uv photometry",
    "could be fitted either with a delayed shock breakout in a non - standard , extended , low - density envelope of a rsg followed by the cooling envelope @xcite , or a numerical simulation for only the cooling envelope component @xcite .",
    "the cadence ( @xmath158 hr ) and low signal - to - noise photometry ( s / n @xmath159 ) in this source were not enough to favor one model over the other , let alone constrain their detailed parameters . while a wind effectively smears out the shock breakout signal , and makes it possible to resolve with a coarser ( 1 day ) cadence , as we report here for ps1 - 13arp , this interpretation would have stronger footing if the theory were proven in the more common case of shock breakout in the sn envelope .",
    "rapid - cadence observations on the timescale of minutes , particularly in the uv band , are required to resolve the putative rapid rise from shock breakout in the sn light curve , and its second uv peak due to the cooling envelope .",
    "future observations of shock breakout of type iip sne in the uv could be a sensitive probe of the mass - loss history of pre - sn rsgs , which is difficult to constrain directly @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a wind will greatly enhance the ability of future uv time domain surveys , such as ultrasat @xcite , to directly detect this diagnostic phase of the sn explosion .",
