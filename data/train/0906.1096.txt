    "high - power lasers and plasmas may be used to accelerate electrons by electric fields that are orders of magnitude greater than those achievable using conventional methods  @xcite .",
    "an intense laser pulse is used to drive a wave in a plasma and , for sufficiently large fields , non - linearities lead to collapse of the wave structure ( ` wave - breaking ' ) due to sufficiently large numbers of electrons becoming trapped in the wave .",
    "hydrodynamic investigations of wave - breaking were first undertaken for cold plasmas  @xcite and thermal effects were later included in non - relativistic  @xcite and relativistic contexts  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a discussion of the numerous approaches ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the value of the electric field at which the wave breaks ( the electric field s ` wave - breaking limit ' ) is highly sensitive to the details of the hydrodynamic model .",
    "plasmas dominated by collisions are described by a pressure tensor that does not deviate far from isotropy , whereas an intense and ultrashort laser pulse propagating through an underdense plasma will drive the plasma anisotropically over typical acceleration timescales .",
    "thus , it is important to accommodate 3-dimensionality and allow for anisotropy when investigating wave - breaking limits .",
    "our aim is to uncover the relationship between wave - breaking limits and the shape of the @xmath1-particle distribution @xmath2 .",
    "in general , the detailed structure of @xmath2 can not be reconstructed from a few low - order moments so we adopt a different approach based on a particular class of piecewise constant @xmath1-particle distributions .",
    "our approach may be considered as a multi - dimensional generalization of the 1-dimensional relativistic ` waterbag ' model employed in  @xcite ( for a discussion of the relationship between our approach and  @xcite see  @xcite ) .",
    "we employ the einstein summation convention throughout and units are used in which the speed of light @xmath3 and the permittivity of the vacuum @xmath4 .",
    "lowercase latin indices @xmath5 run over @xmath6 .",
    "our attention is focussed on plasmas evolving over timescales during which the ` discrete ' nature ( collisions ) of the plasma electrons can be neglected and the plasma ions can be prescribed as a background .",
    "such configurations are well described by the covariant vlasov - maxwell system  @xcite which , for the purposes of this paper , is most usefully expressed in the language of exterior calculus ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we will now briefly summarize the particular formulation of the vlasov - maxwell system employed here .",
    "let @xmath7 be a spacetime with signature @xmath8 for the metric tensor @xmath9 .",
    "each point @xmath10 is associated with a space @xmath11 of future - directed unit normalized vectors on @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the components of the metric @xmath9 in a coordinate system @xmath15 whose patch contains @xmath16 and @xmath17 are induced coordinates on @xmath18 .",

    "the metric dual of a vector @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 for all vectors @xmath44 on @xmath12 and @xmath45 is the hodge map induced from the volume @xmath26-form @xmath27 @xmath46 on @xmath12 .",
    "the components of the electron number @xmath26-current @xmath47 at @xmath10 are given as an integral over the fibre @xmath48 @xmath49 and the ion number @xmath26-current @xmath50 is prescribed as data .",
    "the measure on @xmath21 in ( [ electron_current ] ) is induced from the @xmath0-form @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the alternating symbol with @xmath54 .",
    "the vlasov - maxwell equations constitute a non - linear integro - differential system . direct calculation of its solutions for general plasma configurations is difficult and , to proceed analytically , it is common to approximate the above as a finite number of moments of @xmath2 in @xmath55 satisfying a non - linear field system on @xmath12 ( a so - called ` fluid ' model ) .",
    "however , there are difficult issues associated with closing the resulting field system ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) so we opt for a different approach .",

    "this equation is equivalent to ( [ dvlas ] ) ; however , since it makes no reference to the differentiability of @xmath2 , it may be regarded as a generalisation of ( [ dvlas ] ) applicable to discontinuous @xmath2 .",

    "thus , in the limit as the volume of @xmath60 tends to zero with @xmath64 tending to @xmath67 and @xmath65 tending to @xmath68 , we recover the condition @xmath69",
