    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib or cirb ) contains a considerable fraction of the collective radiation emitted by stars through the cosmic time .",
    "stars in the epoch of reionization ( eor ) have the bulk of their radiation redshifted into the near - infrared band ( @xmath40.7 - 5 @xmath5 m ) and the cib measured in this band is specifically named  near - infrared background \" ( nirb ) . as such",
    ", the nirb offers a unique opportunity to study faint high-@xmath0 galaxies that remain largely undetected in deep galaxy surveys ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is particularly important as these objects are commonly believed to provide most of the ionizing power that drives cosmic reionization @xcite . besides",
    ", the nirb might also help characterizing the stellar populations of the first cosmic systems @xcite .",
    "most recent studies have converged on the prediction that on scales of @xmath1 the fluctuation level from normal star - forming galaxies at @xmath6 is @xmath7  nwm@xmath8sr@xmath9 at 3.6  @xmath5 m @xcite . however , extracting such signal from available data has been so far very challenging , as even when the deepest galaxy subtraction from nirb maps is applied , the remaining flux fluctuations still can not be ascribed to the known high-@xmath0 galaxy population . on small angular scales ,",
    "most of the signal arises from unresolved low-@xmath0 galaxies ( see the first analysis by @xcite ) . on larger scales",
    "the measured power ( see e.g. @xcite ) is @xmath10 times larger than the low-@xmath0 galaxies @xcite , and @xmath11 times larger than that expected from high-@xmath0 normal star - forming galaxies and first stars @xcite .",
    "therefore it must be attributed to some , yet unknown , alternative sources .",
    "basically , two different explanations have been proposed for the origin of such large scale ( @xmath12 )  power excess \" .",
    "they involve either early accreting black holes @xcite which could explain the detected nirb - cosmic x - ray background coherence @xcite , or `` intrahalo light '' that radiated by stars ejected from their parent galaxies during merger events @xcite .    at present",
    "it is unclear which hypothesis should be preferred . besides , it is also possible that first stars or black holes are much more abundant than in the standard theoretical framework  for example if the slope of the density fluctuations power spectrum sightly deviates from the standard one , the number of small halos ( thus stars or black holes therein ) could be boosted exponentially  they can then provide sufficient radiation power . to be consistent with electron scattering reionization bounds , at the same time",
    "the ionizing photon escape probability must be rather low ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) . to further complicate the interpretation ,",
    "recent observations @xcite show that , on large scales and at least for the 1.1 and 1.6  @xmath5 m bands , diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) might provide a non - negligible flux contribution",
    ". however @xcite ( see @xcite as well ) found that at the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 m bands the dgl or the galactic cirrus component is largely subdominant .",
    "for the above reasons , it is urgent to devise new strategies that put our understanding on firmer grounds . in order to isolate the signal from increasingly high redshifts , with sufficient depth and angular resolution one can in principle remove foreground galaxies down to extremely faint levels .",
    "this is challenging for current instrumentation , and also not an easy task for the jwst , as the signal from high-@xmath0 galaxies is expected to be subdominant even at @xmath432 ab mag @xcite .",
    "alternatively , cross - correlation studies seem promising . the nirb - hi 21 cm line cross - correlation @xcite has the advantage that it selectively picks up the signal from reionization sources . also , the nirb , if produced by sources in the eor , would be cross - correlated with the cmb through the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "this correlation could be seen in the forthcoming euclid - based all - sky cib maps @xcite .",
    "in addition to cross - correlation , a recent work @xcite proposed the use of lyman - break tomography to constrain the nirb contribution from sources above a certain redshift .",
    "@xcite analyzed the cross - correlation between the acs - detected faint sources and the source - subtracted nirb .",
    "they found significant correlation on small scales , implying that the faint acs galaxies do contribute to nirb fluctuations .",
    "however , these sources ( or objects associated with them ) can not account for the large scale clustering as the measured correlation is negligible .",
    "their analysis did not pay particular attention to the high-@xmath0 sources , therefore the information on high-@xmath0 galaxies can not be directly derived from there .",
    "it is surprising that so far little attention has been devoted to the search for high-@xmath0 normal star - forming galaxy signatures in the nirb , given that deep galaxy surveys have made tremendous progresses in obtaining the uv luminosity functions ( lf ) up to @xmath13 @xcite , and the detection limits of lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) surveys carried out by hst have already reached @xmath14 @xcite . measuring their intensity fluctuations present ( though tiny ) in the nirb is essentially one of the most exciting perspectives as it might convincingly show that nirb fluctuation experiments can be used to study the first galaxies .",
    "such an experiment is also complementary to more traditional galaxy surveys that derive the lf of the brightest galaxies among early populations .    in summary , it is mandatory to show that the nirb power spectrum signal of already known high-@xmath0 galaxies can be recovered robustly .",
    "demonstrating a successful strategy will represent a major step forward in the methodology and allows to obtain , in addition to the clustering signal , other key quantities , as e.g. the colors of high-@xmath0 galaxies beyond the observed @xmath15 band .",
    "colors , in turn , provide potentially information on stellar ages and initial mass function of the stars harbored by galaxies in the eor .",
    "the idea we propose here is to isolate the targeted lbg signal and show the feasibility of statistically detecting reionization sources by cross - correlating deep lbg surveys with nirb maps .",
    "to this aim , we : ( a ) construct large scale mock maps of the source - subtracted nirb and lbg catalogs using semi - numerical simulations ; ( b ) perform a cross - correlation analysis between the two data sets to extract the contribution of high-@xmath0 galaxies in the nirb .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we use planck cosmological parameters : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab - system @xcite .",
    "using the code dexm @xcite we carry out semi - numerical simulations to get catalogs of halos with mass @xmath18 from @xmath19 to 10 for every @xmath20 . we adopt a 400  mpc box size that corresponds to an angular size of @xmath21  deg at @xmath22 .",
    "we construct a cuboid by replicating the output boxes along the line - of - sight , adding random translations , rotations and reflections @xcite .",
    "this is our light - cone since we assume that all lines - of - sight are parallel  an assumption that is convenient and safe enough when @xmath6 .    to construct flux maps from the light - cone",
    ", we link galaxy luminosities to halo mass @xmath23 .",
    "the observed lfs could be reproduced exactly if we derive the @xmath2 relation through abundance matching , i.e. we force the number density of galaxies with luminosity @xmath24 to match the number density of halos with mass @xmath25 .",
    "formally , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the uv lf at 1600    and we use the schechter parameterization with the redshift - dependent fitting parameters given in @xcite . as a reference , in the derived @xmath2 relations our minimum mass @xmath28 corresponds to an absolute magnitude @xmath29 at @xmath30 respectively .",
    "luminosity at other uv wavelengths is obtained through the luminosity - dependent spectral energy distribution ( sed ) slope @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) in @xcite , the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath35 and 7 could be found in @xcite . for convenience of using this form at in - between redshifts , we fit @xmath0-dependent forms @xcite : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we use these fittings anyway when @xmath3 . ] .",
    "however , generally speaking this power - law only holds at @xmath38   , while we need luminosities at least until @xmath39 m , say 7500    when @xmath40 .",
    "therefore at @xmath412000    we use the sed template from starburst99 @xcite , adopting a continuous star formation mode , with metallicity 0.1  @xmath42 and 200  myr stellar age .",
    "the sb99 seds are normalized to match the power - law form at 2000   .",

    "[ maps ] we show the 1.6  @xmath5 mm flux maps of lbgs , because we consider a redshift range from @xmath19 to 10 . for shorter wavelengths all procedures ( and conclusions )",

    "in addition to the flux from high-@xmath0 ( @xmath61 ) galaxies , the observed nirb also contains radiation from unresolved , low-@xmath0 galaxies , and an excess radiation from unknown sources @xcite .",
    "we collectively refer to these two components as _ contamination _ , since in this work the targeted signal is the flux from high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "to model such contaminating signal we construct random maps with mean flux 1.0 ( 0.7 ) nwm@xmath8sr@xmath9 at 3.6 ( 4.5 ) @xmath5 m and reproduce the sum of ( i ) the angular power spectrum of the power _ excess _ ( see @xcite ) matching available observations @xcite , and ( ii ) the angular power spectrum of low-@xmath0 galaxies @xcite producing shot noise level matching @xcite ( @xmath62nw@xmath63m@xmath64sr@xmath9 at 3.6  @xmath5 m and @xmath65nw@xmath63m@xmath64sr@xmath9 at 4.5  @xmath5 m , the corresponding subtraction magnitude is @xmath66 mag ) .",
    "the steps are :    * a white noise map , i.e. a gaussian random field , is generated .",
    "* this map is then transformed into spatial - frequency space by fft . * for each complex number in frequency space , its modulus is rescaled to be @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the given power spectrum and @xmath69 is the spatial - frequency .",
    "the zero - frequency ( @xmath70 ) element is set to be the mean flux . *",
    "the above map is then transformed back into real space by inverse fft , resulting in a synthetic image with the same 2-point clustering properties as the measured @xmath71 .    in fig .",
    "[ maps ] we plot a single realization of the contamination map at 3.6  @xmath5 m as an example ( bottom right ) .",
    "the contamination is not correlated with the high-@xmath0 galaxy component ; however , it adds noise to the cross - correlation signal . to account for the statistical variance of the contamination ,",
    "we make 30 independent realizations . in fig .",
    "[ aps ] we show the angular power spectrum of bottom panels in fig .",
    "all maps are convolved with a circular symmetric spitzer psf before further analysis .",
    "we first analyze the correlation coefficient between the lbg flux map and the nirb map .",
    "it is defined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 refers to either 3.6 @xmath5 m or 4.5 @xmath5 m , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the flux fluctuations of the same pixel ( zero lag ) at those two wavelengths .",
    "the brackets refer to the pixel - averaged fluctuations .",
    "the correlation coefficient indicates the fraction of sources contributing to common signals . before calculating the correlation coefficient we smooth both the nirb maps and the lbg flux maps by a real space top - hat window function with diameter @xmath76",
    "this is to suppress the instrumental noise since in the measured nirb maps @xcite the instrumental noise is negligible at @xmath77 .",
    "the smoothing is not related to the lbg detection limits since it is performed on maps constructed from lbgs already present in catalogs . to mimic surveys with different areas , we cut out sub - maps with different areas from the full map .",
    "we choose three areas : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80  deg@xmath81 , representing a survey region similar to hudf / xdf , uds , and an hypothetical larger field , respectively .    before calculating the correlation coefficient , in both maps we mask pixels containing galaxies brighter than mag @xmath66 at _ either _ 3.6  @xmath5 m or 4.5  @xmath5 m . from this procedure",
    "we obtain the source - subtracted nirb map . the correlation coefficient vs. lbg limiting magnitude",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ correlation_coefficient ] .",
    "the filled regions contain 68.3% probability of all sub - map samples .",
    "note that we have 30 random realizations for each full map ( ( 2.4)@xmath81 deg@xmath81 ) , so even for the @xmath80  deg@xmath81 case there are 120 samples , sufficient to compute the correlation coefficient variance .",
    "[ correlation_coefficient ] shows that it is indeed feasible to detect the cross - correlation signal from the mock maps , even for a relatively shallow survey with @xmath82 , for which @xmath83 . by pushing the limiting magnitude to fainter values ,",
    "the correlation coefficient rapidly increases by a factor @xmath84 , and then slowly approaches @xmath85 at @xmath86 .",
    "it is worth noting that in small fields the measured correlation coefficient has a @xmath87 relative field - by - field scatter for @xmath88 , and even larger scatter at @xmath89 . in some extreme cases",
    "there would be no or negative cross - correlation detected , due to the small number of lbgs contained in the fields .",
    "to elucidate the differential contribution of lbgs , for a @xmath79 deg@xmath81 field , we further show in fig .",
    "[ correlation_coefficient_z ] the correlation coefficient from lbgs at @xmath90 for @xmath91 and 27 , respectively .",
    "for example , lbgs at @xmath92 contribute @xmath93 at @xmath94 .",
    "our results are for nirb maps with a fixed shot noise level matching @xcite measurements .",
    "since the shot noise is mainly from low-@xmath0 galaxies , an increased subtraction depth implies a relatively larger number of low-@xmath0 galaxies ( with respect to the high-@xmath0 ones ) are resolved and removed . as a result",
    "we expect a higher correlation coefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "if we resolve more lbgs , the cross - power signal also becomes stronger .",
    "thus , the strength of the cross - power signal vs. different lbgs detection depths can be used to determine the differential contribution of early galaxies .",
    "so far we have investigated the behavior of the correlation coefficient by at a specific smoothing scale @xmath76 .",
    "we now examine its dependence on angular scale . to this aim",
    "we re - define the correlation coefficient in the spatial - frequency domain via the power spectrum @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the cross - power spectrum and @xmath97,@xmath98 are the auto - power spectra .",
    "they are all calculated using the 2d fft . since @xmath99 , @xmath100 for the same @xmath101 .",
    "first we derive the shot noise due to lbgs fainter than a given h - magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ psn ] ) .",
    "it is the value of @xmath102 taken on a sufficiently small scale @xmath103 ( a stability check of the results for scales up to @xmath104 has been performed ) . as we will point out in the following , shot",
    "noise is the most important term contributing to the cross - correlation .",
    "the shot noise level shown here is a useful reference for possible follow - up work on real data .",
    "the @xmath105 between the source - subtracted nirb at @xmath106 m and the 1.6  @xmath5 m flux map of lbgs with @xmath107 and 27 is shown by fig .",
    "[ correlation_coefficient_q ] .",
    "the errorbars are the r.m.s of 30 samples each one using different random contamination realizations .",
    "the cross - power spectrum includes both the shot noise and clustering terms .",
    "shot noise is from sources common to both nirb and lbg flux , and it is dominant on scales @xmath108 . on larger scales ,",
    "the clustering term progressively takes over .",
    "this term arises from all sources sharing the same large scale structure , including galaxies even fainter than the lbg limiting magnitude . as a consequence , in principle",
    "the clustering term could allow the detection of fainter galaxies in the source - subtracted nirb through the cross - correlation with relatively bright lbgs .",
    "however , as shown by fig .",
    "[ correlation_coefficient_q ] the cross - correlation is more easily detected on small scales . although the clustering term may contain more information , the main difficulty to be overcome in order to efficiently use this strategy is that even for a relatively large survey area of @xmath109  deg@xmath81 ( i.e. our full map ) , the signal - to - noise ratio never exceeds @xmath110 at @xmath111 for @xmath112 . while increasing the limiting magnitude to @xmath113 does not help much to this aim",
    ", the noise could be reduced by using larger survey areas , as expected with , e.g. euclid and wfirst .      from our mock maps",
    "it is also possible to characterize the colors , i.e. the ratio between flux in two bands , of unresolved galaxies in nirb observations . with the assumption",
    "@xmath114 we derive the magnitude difference as @xmath115-[4.5 ] & = 2.5{\\rm log}\\left ( \\frac{4.5f_{4.5}}{3.6f_{3.6 } }   \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx2.5{\\rm log}\\left ( \\frac{4.5}{3.6 }   \\frac{\\mean { ( \\delta f_{4.5 } \\delta f_{1.6 } ) _ \\theta } } { \\mean { ( \\delta f_{3.6 } \\delta f_{1.6 } ) _ \\theta }   }    \\right )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such magnitude difference , which might considerably vary for individual galaxies , represents the combined and weighted color of the unresolved galaxy population in these bands . in practice the psf adds a bias to the measured flux ratio . therefore before calculating the magnitude difference it would be necessary to first deconvolve the psf from each map .",
    "we skip this step here and directly calculate the magnitude difference on maps without psf convolution .",
    "again we specify @xmath76 . the predicted color as a function of @xmath116 is reported in fig .",
    "[ color ] , allowing us to conclude that the magnitude difference which is @xmath4 - 0.13 mag , could be detected by cross - correlating survey maps with area @xmath117 deg@xmath81 .",
    "the figure reiterates that smaller area fields would be affected by bias effects .",
    "motivated by the fact that lbg surveys carried out by the hst have reached detection limits much deeper than the nirb measured by spitzer at longer wavelengths , in this paper we investigated the feasibility to pick the resolved lbgs component out of the nirb by a cross - correlation analysis .",
    "our investigations were based on mock maps constructed from semi - numerical simulations of halo formation , and empirically determined @xmath2 relations .",
    "we found that in the nirb observed at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath5 m and with sources subtracted down to @xmath425 apparent magnitude , at smallest scales where the shot noise dominates , about 10% of the flux fluctuations arises from lbgs in @xmath3 and with @xmath118 .",
    "such faint galaxies have already been resolved in the existing deep surveys .",
    "however , this fractional contribution , if measured from narrow fields with area @xmath119",
    "deg@xmath81 ( as the hudf / xdf ) , could vary from @xmath120 to @xmath121 . if the limiting magnitude is decreased to @xmath122 , the fractional contribution decreases to about 8% .",
    "if in this case we consider a larger field , e.g. with area similar to the uds ( @xmath123  deg@xmath81 ) , then the correlation coefficient varies in the narrower range @xmath124 .",
    "we remind that the variance at hand here is due to both the large - scale inhomogeneity of the signal and the contamination : it is the field - to - field variance of the correlation itself .",
    "we do not model errors introduced by data analysis procedures , as for example mask effects .",
    "however , at least theoretically we have shown that the contribution from the faintest galaxies could be isolated from the nirb through the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we pointed out that it is still challenging to use the cross - correlation arising from the clustering term of the cross - power spectrum to study galaxies unresolved not only in nirb observations , but also in lbg surveys .",
    "this term is dominant at @xmath125 , but even for survey areas as large as @xmath109  deg@xmath81 , the signal has a small significance , with a s / n ratio @xmath126 .",
    "although very unlikely , if the nirb clustering excess originates from lbgs we would detect a correlation coefficient close to 1 at scales where the clustering term dominates .",
    "stated differently , a measured correlation coefficient @xmath127 would actually rule out this scenario .",
    "our results have interesting implications also for the colors of high-@xmath0 galaxy population .",
    "the colors of lbgs detected at wavelengths @xmath128 m but too faint to be individually resolved by existing telescopes at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath5 m , can be obtained by using the cross - correlation with the nirb in these two longer wavelength bands .",
    "it is worth noting that the predictions presented in this paper assume a contaminating signal in the form of nirb fluctuation excess which originates from direct collapse black holes at high @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "if however the excess is found to arise more locally , we might be able to model or subtract it more accurately , thereby making the signal calculated in this paper more easily detectable , i.e. @xmath129 .    importantly , the study proposed here can be further developed to infer the properties of even fainter high-@xmath0 galaxy populations that are currently inaccessible to direct telescopic detection .",
    "this could , for example , be accomplished by a lyman - break tomography study designed to isolate high-@xmath0 populations via multi - band cross - correlations without requiring prior lbg detections @xcite .",
