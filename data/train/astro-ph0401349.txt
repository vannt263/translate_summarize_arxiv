    "galaxy formation is one of the most fundamental problems in astrophysics . to understand how galaxies form , we need to unravel how stars form from the primordial gas and how the first stars interact with their surrounding environments .",
    "as there are no heavy elements in the early universe , the thermodynamic behavior of the gas is essentially controlled by h@xmath5 cooling , and the first population iii stars are expected to be very massive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . while much progress has been made in finding large populations of galaxies at high ( @xmath6 ) redshifts ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , truly young galaxies in the process of forming remain elusive in the distant universe .",
    "the spectra of those far - away galaxies generally indicate the presence of a substantial amount of heavy elements , implying previous star formation and metal enrichment . instead of focussing on high - redshift galaxies , another approach is to study massive star formation and its interaction with the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) in a class of nearby metal - deficient dwarf galaxies called blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies , some of which are thought to be undergoing their first episode of star formation .",
    "the formation of the hot gas phase is one of the most fundamental processes operating in the early period of galaxy formation and it has important consequences on the subsequent dynamical state and photometric evolution of the dwarf system .",
    "the generation of large amounts of hot ( a few @xmath7  k ) , rarefied gas is the result of injection of energy and momentum into the cold ambient ism by stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae .",
    "the starburst activity which fuels the ism of young dwarf galaxies with hot x - ray emitting gas lasts about 10 million years .",
    "it is then followed by a long ( @xmath82  gyr ) quiescent period of passive photometric evolution .",
    "moreover , expansion of the hot ism on scales comparable to the galactic scale length can lead to a rapid funneling of gaseous mass into the cold gaseous halo .",
    "the details of such a process are expected to be sensitively related to the energy injection rate into the ism and the geometry and robustness of the ambient cold gaseous medium @xcite .",
    "extensive mass loss can lead to an expansion of the stellar population and to a morphological evolution of the dwarf galaxy ( for example a dwarf irregular galaxy may lose its gas and evolve into a dwarf elliptical ) or even disrupt the system entirely @xcite .    here",

    "* )    the x - ray spectra of the point sources are well fitted by moderately soft power - laws , typical of x - ray emission from hmxbs or ulxs .",
    "the high x - ray luminosities of these sources could be the result of the lower metallicities of the bcds studied here ( if accretion is via stellar winds ) , or beaming ( as is thought to occur in some ulxs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mean luminosity of galactic hmxbs is @xmath4 5@xmath1410@xmath98  erg  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray sources in sbs  0335@xmath0052 , sbs  0335@xmath0052w and i  zw  18 are respectively about 600 , 1300 and 300 times brighter . for comparison , the hmxbs in the magellanic clouds ( the lmc and the smc have respectively 1/3 and 1/8 of the sun s metallicity ) are about 50 times brighter than their galactic counterparts @xcite .    in the event of x - ray emission produced by accretion onto a compact object by a stellar wind , there are two main reasons which may explain the boosting of the x - ray luminosities of hmxbs in low - metallicity systems @xcite .",
    "first , the x - ray heating of the gas as it falls toward a compact object depends strongly on the atomic number z , since the photoelectric cross - section goes as z@xmath99 .",
    "thus in low - metallicity systems , the x - ray heating is less , resulting in a larger accretion rate because it is less impeded by heating .",
    "second , the accretion rate dm / dt increases strongly as the stellar wind velocity v of an ob star as the orbit of the compact object decreases ( dm / dt is proportional to v@xmath100 ) .",
    "it is known that the terminal wind velocity in low - metallicity systems drops significantly . @xcite",
    "have measured a terminal velocity of @xmath4 500 km s@xmath3 for sbs  0335@xmath0052 , as compared to 20004000 km s@xmath3 for the galaxy and the lmc , and 12001500 km s@xmath3 for the smc .",
    "thus the high x - ray luminosities of the sources in the metal - deficient galaxies sbs  0335@xmath0052 , sbs 0335052w and i  zw  18 ( i.e. , @xmath101  erg  s@xmath3 ) do not necessarily require extreme black hole masses .",
    "the x - ray luminosities found here are higher than the point - source luminosities observed in less metal - poor dwarf starburst dwarf galaxies such as ngc  3077 ( z@xmath10 , @xmath102@xmath103 , @xmath104% from point sources ; * ? ? ?",

    "the non - thermal radio source can be associated with the x - ray point source .",
    "however the nature of such a radio+x - ray emitting object is not clear .",
    "while its x - ray luminosity is similar to that expected from a microquasar associated with a medium - mass black hole , its radio luminosity is about a million times greater than that observed in such objects @xcite .",
    "it can also be that the x - ray and radio sources are physically distinct objects , although they are both associated with the massive starburst episode that gave birth to the sscs .",
    "we note also that the time scale for hmxb formation of 310  myr after the onset of the starburst is consistent with the ages of 5  myr or younger of sscs 1 and 2 in sbs  0335@xmath0052 @xcite and of @xmath4 3  myr of the nw component in i  zw  18 @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) in addition to the point source emission in sbs 0335052 and i zw 18 , there appears also to be faint extended diffuse x - ray emission from hot gas , hints of which can be seen in the smoothed x - ray contours of figure  [ fig : overlay ] , particularly in i  zw  18 .",
    "this emission , if truly diffuse , can be understood in both bcds as produced by the hot gas filling the cavity of a superbubble carved out in the ism of the bcd by stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "indeed , _ hst _ optical imaging by til shows a large superbubble cavity of radius @xmath4 380 pc in sbs  0335@xmath0052 , northeast of ssc 3 ( see their figure 1 ) , where the diffuse x - ray emission appears to lie . using equations 2 , 4 and 6 of @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath114 of the superbubble is proportional to @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the radius of the superbubble , @xmath117 the ambient ism density and @xmath118 the gas temperature .",
    "adopting @xmath119  pc , @xmath120  @xmath121 and @xmath122  k , the predicted @xmath114 is in good agreement with the observed diffuse x - ray luminosity of @xmath123  ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "as for i  zw  18 , the diffuse x - ray emission lie between the nw and se centers of star formation .",
    "_ hst _ optical imaging by @xcite suggests the presence of a supernova cavity there of radius 120 pc ( see their figure 3 ) . with @xmath124  pc , @xmath125  @xmath121 and @xmath126  k ,",
    "@xmath114 is equal to @xmath127  ergs  s@xmath3 , again in good agreement with the observed diffuse x - ray luminosity in i  zw  18 .",
    "\\3 ) the spectrum of i  zw  18 shows a strong emission line at @xmath4 0.65 kev , identified by @xcite to be a o viii hydrogen - like line .",
    "the best spectral fit ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) gives an overabundance of oxygen by a factor of @xmath4 7 with respect to the sun and of @xmath4 350 with respect to the other heavy elements .",
    "it is interesting that this line is so strong because _ fuse _ observations of the hi interstellar gas in i  zw  18 @xcite shows the ism to be as or more metal - deficient than the hii gas , i.e. to be less than 2% of the solar metallicity .",
    "the presence of a sizable amount of oxygen in the x - ray spectrum of the point source is most likely due to oxygen - enrichment by either a companion star ( in the case of an x - ray binary ) or undiluted supernova ejecta ( in the case of hot gas ) .",
    "further progress in our understanding of the x - ray emission in sbs  0335@xmath0052 , sbs  0335@xmath0052w and i  zw  18 will require substantially better photon statistics and higher spatial resolution . a long observation with _ xmm - newton _ , or _",
