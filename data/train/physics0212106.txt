    "compact diode - pumped sources of the femtosecond pulses tunable within the wavelength range between 2 and 3 @xmath0 m are of interest for various applications , such as laser surgery , remote sensing and monitoring , spectroscopy of semiconductors etc . to date",
    "only cryogenically operated pb - salt diode lasers , optical parametrical oscillators and difference - frequency convertors were available for the operation in this spectral range .",
    "therefore the possibility of the direct mid - ir lasing from the new class of the transition - metal doped chalcogenides  @xcite has attracted much attention .",
    "the impressive advantages of these media are room - temperature operation between 2 and 3 @xmath0 m , possibility of direct diode pumping , high emission and absorption cross - sections , negligibly low excited - state absorption and , as consequence , low thermal load ( the basic laser material characteristics will be described in the next section ) . the most remarkable examples of such lasers are cr@xmath1-doped znse , zns and znte . to date",
    "the following achievements for these media have been demonstrated : 1 ) for cr : znse cw operation with over 1.7 w power  @xcite , over 1100 nm tunability  @xcite , over 350 nm tunable diode - pumped cw operation  @xcite , active mode locking  @xcite and active modulator assisted passive mode locking  @xcite were achieved ; 2 ) for cr : zns pulsed  @xcite and tunable cw operation  @xcite were obtained .",
    "cr : znte , which is a member of the considered media class , remains unexplored .    in spite of the numerous advantages ,",
    "there exist some obstacles for femtosecond pulse generation from these lasers . as they are the semiconductors , i.e. possess a comparatively narrow band - gap , the nonlinear refraction in the active crystal is large ( see below ) .",
    "hence the self - focusing has a comparatively low threshold which in the combination with the self - phase modulation produce a tendency to the multiple pulse operation in the kerr - lens mode locking ( klm ) regime  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a need in the study of the klm stability limits and methods of the stability enhancement in the considered lasers .",
    "moreover , the large absorption and emission cross sections tend to the stabilization of the cw operation , which prevents the klm self - start .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of the nonlinear refraction in the zinc - chalcogenides ( by the example of znse ) . in the combination with the lasing properties this defines the main requirements to the klm optimization .",
    "then , the results of the numerical optimization of the klm aimed at the multipulsing suppression and taking into account a strong saturation of the kerr - lens induced fast absorber are presented .",
    "we demonstrate the possibility of the few optical cycle pulse generation from the cr - doped zinc - chalcogenodes .",
    "the problem of the self - starting klm is analyzed on the basis of the generalized momentum method taking into account real - world laser configurations , gain guiding , soft - aperture , thermo - lensing and other properties of the considered laser materials .",
    "the presented models are quite general and can be applied to the overall optimization of the different klm lasers .",
    "simulation of the klm can be based on the two quite different approaches .",
    "first one supposes the full - dimensional modelling taking into account the details of the field propagation in the laser cavity  @xcite .",
    "the minimal dimension of such models is 2 + 1 and they allow the description of the spatio - temporal dynamics of the ultrashort pulses and their mode pattern .",
    "its main disadvantages are a large number of the parameters resulting in ambiguity of the optimization procedure and complexity of the interpretation of the obtained results .",
    "second approach is based on 1 + 1 dimensional model in the framework of the so - called nonlinear ginzburg - landau equation  @xcite , which describes the klm as an action of the fast saturable absorber governed by the few physically meaningful parameters , viz . , its modulation depth @xmath2 and the inverse saturation intensity @xmath3 .",
    "this method allows the analytical realization in the week - nonlinear limit  @xcite , however in the general case the numerical simulations are necessary .",
    "we shall base our analysis on the both approaches .    in the beginning",
    "let us consider the master equation describing the ultrashort pulse generation in the klm solid - state laser :    @xmath4a(z , t),\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the field amplitude ( so that @xmath6 has a dimension of the intensity ) , @xmath7 is the longitudinal coordinate normalized to the cavity length ( thus , as a matter of fact , this is the cavity round - trip number ) , @xmath8 is the local time , @xmath9 is the saturated gain coefficient , @xmath10 is the linear net - loss coefficient taking into account the intracavity and output losses , @xmath11 is the group delay caused by the spectral filtering within the cavity , @xmath12 are the @xmath13-order group - delay dispersion ( gdd ) coefficients , @xmath14 = @xmath15 = @xmath16 is the self - phase modulation ( spm ) coefficient , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the frequency and wavelength corresponding to the gain band maximum , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the linear and nonlinear refraction indexes , respectively , @xmath21 is the double length of the gain medium ( we suppose that the gain medium gives a main contribution to the spm ) .",
    "the last term in eq .   describes the self - steepening effect and for the simplification will be not taken into account in the simulations . as an additional simplification we neglect the stimulated raman scattering in the active medium  @xcite .",
    "these two factors will be considered hereafter .",
    "the gain coefficient obeys the following equation :    @xmath22    here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the absorption and emission cross - sections of the active medium , respectively , @xmath25 is the gain relaxation time , @xmath26 is the absorbed pump intensity , @xmath27 is the pump frequency , @xmath28 = @xmath29 is the maximum gain coefficient , @xmath30 is the concentration of the active centers .",
    "the assumption @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the pulse duration , @xmath33 is the cavity period ) allows the integration of eq .  .",
    "then for the steady - state gain coefficient we have :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 = @xmath36 is the gain saturation energy flux , @xmath37 = @xmath38 is the pulse energy .    for the numerical simulations in the framework of the distributed model it is convenient to normalize the time and the intensity to @xmath11 = @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ( @xmath41 is the gain bandwidth ) .",
    "the simulation were performed on the @xmath42 mesh .",
    "only steady - state pulses were considered . as the criterion of the steady - state operation we chose the peak intensity change less than 1% over last 1000 cavity transits .",
    "the klm in the considered model ( [ lg ] , [ alpha ] ) is governed by the only four basic parameters : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "this allows unambiguous multiparametric optimization . in the presence of the higher - order dispersions ,",
    "the additional @xmath12 parameters appear .",
    "this complicates the optimization procedure , but keeps its physical clarity .",
    "now let us consider the basic active media parameters .",
    ".[params - exp ] material parameters of the cr - doped zinc - chalcogenides . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the previous section we considered the ultrashort pulse stability on the basis of the distributed 1 + 1-dimensional model . however , this model can not provide answers to the basic questions : what is the self - start ability of the kerr - lens mode locking and what has the real - world laser configuration to be ?",
    "these questions require an analysis on the basis of the time - spatial model .",
    "the simplest way is the assumption of the gaussian spatial distribution for the laser beam reducing problem to the 1 + 2-dimensions .",
    "the free - space propagation of the gaussian beam can be considered on the basis of the usual abcd - matrix formalism , while the propagation inside the nonlinear active medium is described by the following equation :    @xmath45a\\left ( { z , r , t } \\right ) + i\\chi \\left| { a\\left ( { z , r , t } \\right ) } \\right|^2 a\\left ( { z , r , t } \\right ) =   \\\\   \\alpha \\exp \\left ( { - \\frac{{2r^2 } } { { w_p^2 } } } \\right)a\\left ( { z , r , t } \\right ) + t_f ' ^2 \\frac{{\\partial ^2 a\\left ( { z , r , t } \\right ) } } { { \\partial t^2 } }",

    "( [ gain ] ) in the following way :    @xmath63    where @xmath64=@xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the generation power ) , @xmath67 is the generation mode beam size .",

    "is based on the so - called aberrationless approximation : the propagating field has the invariable spatial - time profile , which is described by the set of the @xmath7-dependent parameters . in the non - dissipative case",
    "this approximation allows the variational approach providing rigorous description of the gaussian beam propagation outside the parabolical approximation  @xcite .    in the dissipative case we have to use the momentum method  @xcite",

    "eq . ( [ iter ] ) in the combination with the abcd - formalism allows defining the stability regions for cw , single- and multiple pulsing ( the latter requires the trivial generalization of the trial function ) .",
    "such regions can predict the real - world laser configurations providing the self - starting kerr - lens mode locking .    as it is seen from table 2 the main features of the considered",
    "active media are the comparatively low @xmath80 ( e.g. @xmath80=2.6 mw for ti : sapphire ) and the extremely low @xmath81 ( 300 kw for ti : sapphire ) .",
    "this causes the stabilization of the cw against the mode locking due to the strong gain saturation .",
    "however , as it is seen from eqs .",
    "( [ gain2 ] , [ iter ] ) ( note that the gain saturation is intensity - dependent , but the self - focusing is power - dependent ) , we can enhance the tendency to the mode locking due to the suppression of the gain saturation .",
    "this can be achieved by the growth of the generation mode within the active medium owing to , for example , the cavity shortening or the decrease of the folding mirrors curvature ( fig .",
    "[ zones ] ) . at the same time we have to keep the moderate level of the absorbed pump power and to use the asymmetrical cavity in order to separate the stability zones .",
    "the preferable configurations correspond to the pulse operation without the cw .",
    "this occurs between the cw stability zones ( see fig .  [ zones ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we presented the models , which can be usable for the numerical optimization of the klm lasers . on the basis of these models ,",
    "the klm abilities of the cr - doped zinc - chalcogenides were estimated .",
    "it was shown , that the strong spm inherent to these media and destabilizing the single pulse operation can be overcomed by the choice of the appropriate gdd , pump , modulation depth and saturation parameter of the kerr - lensing induced fast saturable absorber . as a result ,",
    "the cr : znte possesses the lowest klm threshold , however strong spm constrains the achievable pulse power for this laser .",
    "the best stability for the highest energy flux and the shortest pulse duration ( 19 fs ) are achievable in cr : zns .",
    "cr : znse .",
    "the presence of the third - order dispersion increases the minimum achievable pulse durations up to 34 - 40 fs and causes the strong ( up to 140 nm ) stokes shift of the generation wavelength .",
    "however , the latter effect does not reduce noticeably the pulse energy .",
    "the kerr - lens mode locking self - start ability of the considered active media is reduced by the strong gain saturation so that the cavity tuning providing the ultrashort pulsing differs essentially from that for the ti : sapphire .",
    "we have to avoid over - pumping and over - shortening of the generation mode . as a result , the short and asymmetrical cavities with the comparatively large curvature of the folding mirrors are preferable . on the whole , the cr - doped zinc - chalcogenides have the prospects for the sub-50 fs generation that amounts to only few optical cycles around 2.5 @xmath0 m .",
