    "the @xmath0 meson is an important probe for studying the chiral symmetry restoration and strangeness production in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the decay of the @xmath0 meson into dilepton ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 channels can probe the final state of the collision differently .",
    "the dileptons have insignificant interactions with the medium , whereas the kaons can scatter until freeze - out .",
    "the presence of a hot and dense medium can modify the spectral properties ( mass and/ or width ) of the @xmath0 mesons @xcite .",
    "however , there are predictions of @xmath0 width modifications in the cold nuclear matter as well @xcite . in general",
    ", it is quite important to investigate the evolution of the @xmath0 meson spectral properties from cold to hot nuclear matter created in d + au and au + au collisions , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 meson consists of @xmath7 quarks .",
    "it is , therefore , sensitive to the strangeness production in high energy collisions .",
    "the production mechanism of strangeness in heavy ion collisions can be investigated through the measurement of the particle yields .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 production with system sizes can be studied by measuring the yields in different centrality classes in au + au and d + au collisions .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic has measured @xmath0 mesons in both au + au and d + au collisions .",
    "we shall mainly concentrate on the preliminary results of @xmath0 meson measurement in d + au collisions and its comparison with au + au collisions at @xmath8 = 200 gev .",
    "the results described here are obtained using the two central arm spectrometers @xcite , located east and west of the beam line at mid - rapidity with @xmath9 radian azimuthal coverage each .",
    "the collision vertex and centrality are measured by the beam beam counter .",
    "the momentum of each track is determined by the drift chamber along with a layer of pad chamber .",
    "tracking and pattern recognition is accomplished by three layers of pad chamber .",
    "the @xmath1 reconstruction uses kaons identified with high resolution time - of - flight ( tof ) wall at the east arm within @xmath10 @xmath11 0.35 and @xmath12 and the lead scintillator ( pbsc ) arrays located at both east and west spectrometer arms .",
    "the tof identifies kaons within @xmath13 while the pbsc provides @xmath14 separation within a momentum range of @xmath15 .",
    "the electrons , used for @xmath0 meson reconstruction in @xmath4 channel , are primarily identified by the ring imaging cerenkov detector .",
    "further identification was provided by requiring the energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter to match the measured momentum of the tracks .",
    "we have analyzed 62 @xmath16 @xmath17 minimum - bias d + au events within @xmath18 30 cm for @xmath1 analysis and 31 @xmath16 @xmath17 single - electron triggered events for @xmath2 analysis .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath0 mesons takes place in two steps .",
    "first , we combine oppositely charged tracks ( kaons for @xmath1 and electrons for @xmath2 ) to form unlike sign invariant mass spectrum which has some combinatorial background . in the second step , we estimated the combinatorial background by event mixing technique .    for the @xmath1 analysis , we combined all @xmath19 s from one event with all @xmath20 s from the ten other events of the same centrality and vertex class . by limiting ourselves to a combinatorial background that does not exceed more than ten times the statistics of the actual distribition",
    ", the errors for fluctuations are ensured to be poisson @xcite .",
    "the validitr of this event mixing technique is confirmed with like sign distributions .",
    "finally , the unlike sign mixed event mass distribution is normalized to the measured 2@xmath21 .",
    "the systematics associated with the normalization procedure is studied by normalizing the same event unlike sign distributions to the mixed events within different invariant mass ranges above @xmath0 mass range .",
    "typically , we use four different normalization ranges namely , @xmath22 @xmath11 1.1 , 1.15 , 1.2 and 1.25 gev/@xmath23 . the systematic error in the extracted @xmath0 yield from normalization is estimated to be around 4% .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath0 mesons in @xmath6 decay channel is shown in fig .  [ phi_inv ] .    for the @xmath2 analysis",
    "extra care is taken to form the mixed event background because the event sample used for di - electron analysis is triggered .",
    "the minimum - bias events are used to form the mixed pair , where one of the electrons is required to pass the trigger requirements . additionally , as in @xmath6 pairing , events used to form the mixed pairs are required to have similar centralities and vertex positions .",
    "the normalization of the mixed event background is done by matching the data to the background in a sideband region between 850 and 950 mev/@xmath23 below the signal and 1100 - 1200 mev/@xmath23 above the signal .",
    "other methods of normalization are used to calculate the systematic error from this procedure .",
    "the invariant mass spectra are fitted with relativistic breit wigner distributions convolved with a gaussian @xmath0 mass resolution function to study the line shape of this vector meson .",
    "the preliminary analysis shows the @xmath0 meson spectral shape to be consistent with the particle data book .",
    "@xmath1 ( left ) @xmath2 ( right ) invariant mass spectra . in each plot",
    ", the upper panel shows the same event and combinatorial invariant mass distribution while the lower panel exhibits the subtracted mass spectrum . ]",
    "in order to make the transverse mass spectra , we corrected the @xmath0 meson yields for detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiency by monte - carlo simulation .",
    "this is carried out by generating single @xmath0 mesons with exponential @xmath24 distribution assuming an inverse slope of @xmath25 mev and processing these simulated events through phenix detector simulation chain that makes the simulated data to be tuned with realistic detector responses .",
    "finally , we calculate the acceptance correction factors defined as @xmath26 for different @xmath27 bins .",
    "in addition , we apply the corrections associated with triggering efficiency and efficiencies related with experimental run period to obtain the corrected @xmath0 yields .",
    "the minimum bias @xmath27 distributions of the @xmath0 mesons are reconstructed by dividing the whole dataset into different @xmath27 bins .",
    "the minimum bias transverse mass distributions of @xmath0 mesons are shown in fig .  [ mtphi ] .",
    "the transverse mass spectra in @xmath6 decay channel is shown in the left hand side while @xmath2 @xmath27 spectrum is shown on the right .",

    "the preliminary data shows the consistency in the @xmath0 yield , dn / dy and inverse slope , t in both channels",
    ". it may be useful here to mention that a factor of 2 - 4 discrepancy in the @xmath0 yield in kaon and @xmath5 decay channels was observed by na49 and na50 experiments @xcite respectively in pb + pb collisions at @xmath8 = 17.27 gev ; the yield in di - muon channel was higher .",
    "the possible medium effects which might had caused this discrepancy is unlikely to be present in case of d + au collisions which produce cold nuclear matter .",
    "the consistency in the @xmath0 yield in d + au collisions is therefore quite expected .",
    "the @xmath0 meson yield in di - electron channel in au + au collisions at @xmath8 = 200 gev was mesured by the phenix @xcite on the basis of 2001 au + au run at rhic .",
    "but , the statistical and systematic errors in that preliminary measurement was too high to observe any discripency compared to @xmath6 decay channel .",
