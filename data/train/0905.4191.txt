    "non - linear effects in electronic systems are an interesting playground to look for novel transport properties that can not occur in equilibrium .",
    "a famous example is the franz - keldysh effect in semiconductors , where the band edge exhibits red - shifts in static or ac electric fields .",
    "this can be considered as an effect of the deformation of the electron wavefunction , i.e. , leakage to the gap region , in strong electric fields , which leads to the change in response properties .",
    "recently , a novel , optically controlled non - linear phenomenon has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the present authors revealed a new type of hall effect  photovoltaic hall effect  can emerge in honeycomb lattices such as graphene subject to intense , circularly - polarized light despite the absence of static magnetic fields .",
    "if we denote the gauge field representing the circularly - polarized light as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the field strength and @xmath2 the frequency of the light , the tight - binding hamiltonian for electrons reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nearest - neighbor hopping for the honeycomb lattice , @xmath5 the unit vector connecting the bond between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and spins are ignored .",
    "the hamiltonian is time periodic , and , in momentum space the @xmath8-points are driven in the brillouin zone by the field as @xmath9 .",
    "the orbit is a circle centered at @xmath10 with a radius @xmath11 , and the time period is @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    during the motion , the electron wave function acquires a nontrivial geometric phase , known as the aharnov - anandan phase@xcite which is the non - adiabatic extension of the berry phase@xcite and reduces to the berry phase in the adiabatic limit @xmath13 with a fixed @xmath11 .",
    "an important feature in the electron wavefunctions in time - periodic systems , which is a temporal analogue of bloch s theorem for spatially periodic systems , is that the solution @xmath14 of the time - dependent schrdinger equation can be described by the time - periodic floquet states @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the floquet quasi - energy and @xmath18 an index that labels the floquet states .",
    "note that @xmath18 becomes a composite index @xmath19 when the original system has an internal degrees of freedom @xmath6 , e.g. the band index for multiband systems such as the dirac cone with electron and hole branches , while @xmath20 denotes the number of absorbed photons .     around a dirac point in a circularly - polarized light field .",

    "if we define the inner product averaged over a period of the ac laser field by @xmath21 , the floquet states span a complete orthogonal basis in the presence of a strong laser field , and one can perform a perturbation expansion in the small dc field to probe the ( hall ) conductivity to obtain a kubo formula extended to the case of strong ac irradiation @xcite , @xmath22}{{\\varepsilon}_\\beta({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}})-{\\varepsilon}_\\alpha({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$ } } ) } \\frac { { { \\langle } { \\langle } } \\phi_\\alpha({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}})|j_b|\\phi_{\\beta}({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}){{\\rangle } { \\rangle } } { { \\langle } { \\langle } } \\phi_\\beta({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}})|j_a|\\phi_{\\alpha}({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}){{\\rangle } { \\rangle } } } { { \\varepsilon}_\\beta({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}})-{\\varepsilon}_\\alpha({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}})+i\\eta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the non - equilibrium distribution ( occupation fraction ) of the @xmath18-th floquet state , @xmath24 the current operator , and @xmath25 a positive infinitesimal . the difference from the conventional kubo formula in the absence of ac fields is that the energy is replaced with the floquet quasi - energy , and the inner product with a time average .",
    "the photovoltaic hall conductivity can be further simplified to @xcite , @xmath26_z , \\label{eq : tknn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of a gauge field @xmath27 .",
    "this reduces to the tknn formula @xcite in the adiabatic limit .",

    "let us have a closer look at the floquet states and the photovoltaic curvature @xmath30_z $ ] in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we begin by noting that there exists infinite array of photo - dressed states in the floquet spectrum , whose quasi - energy is shifted by @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) from the plotted ones . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( a ) , we plot the floquet quasi - energy against wave number for the floquet states having the largest weight of the @xmath33 floquet state ( a descendant of the original @xmath34 dispersion ) . an important feature in the plot is that the band - gap - like structure around @xmath35 , where the gap opens an outcome of the photo - induced hybridization of levels , a first - order effect in @xmath36 .",
    "more importantly , a small gap opens @xcite at the dirac points around @xmath37 , which is a consequence of circularly - polarized light .",
    "the photovoltaic berry curvature is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) for the same parameters . around each k - point",
    "we find a peak surrounded by concentric circles and lines .",
    "the peak is due to the gap opening at the dirac points , we can see that the sign is the same for both @xmath38 and @xmath39 points .",
    "they contribute equally to the photovoltaic hall coefficient in the momentum integral in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : tknn ] ) and _ no cancellation between @xmath38 and @xmath39 points occurs_. on the other hand , the concentric circles and lines are due to the photo - induced hybridization , e.g. , the former corresponds to the band structure around @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( a ) .",
    "the two major candidates for the observation of the photovoltaic hall effect are    * graphene , including multi - layer systems , * surface states in topological insulators ,    in which dirac - like dispersions are realized . as for the experimental feasibility , a typical intensity of laser conceived here",
    ", @xmath40 , corresponds to @xmath41 for photon energy @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the size of the photovoltaic dirac gap @xmath44 scales as @xmath45 for small field strengths , which was derived in ref .",
    "this formula implies that with a smaller laser energy @xmath46 we can realize the photovoltaic hall effect with a weaker laser strength @xmath36 .",
    "hence it should be interesting to study the @xmath46 dependence of the photovoltaic hall effect .",
    "another important point is that in graphene , the dirac dispersion is realized near zero energy , but the dispersion begins to reflect the lattice structure for higher energies , hence for higher values of @xmath46 .",
    "so we may ask : will the hall effect survive when @xmath46 becomes large , say comparable with the band width ?    in order to clarify this point , we have calculated the photovoltaic berry curvature for several values of @xmath46 in fig .  [ fig3 ] . for a smaller frequency in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( a ) , the central peak becomes smaller and broader .",
    "the surrounding concentric circles become closely packed and increase in number because we now have contributions from photo - induced hybridization around @xmath47 in addition to @xmath48 . for a larger frequency in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( b ) , on the other hand , the peaks survive even though @xmath46 is greater than the band width .",
    "however , the peak becomes smaller ( and narrower ) , so it will become more difficult to observe the effect .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( c ) , we plot the photovoltaic hall coefficient ( eqn.(3 ) ) against the strength of the circularly polarized light . here",
    ", we assumed sudden switch on of the electric fields , which implies @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the zero field eigen - wavefunction , and @xmath51 its energy .",
    "this assumption is expected to breakdown in the presence of dissipation , however , the basic trend do not change which was confirmed by calculations based on more elaborate techniques @xcite . as expected from the scaling relation of the photovoltaic dirac gap @xmath52 ( eqn .",
    "( 4 ) ) , the hall coefficient first increases as @xmath53 in the weak field limit . at this field strength ,",
    "the physics can be understood by the central peaks of the berry curvature at the k and k points . however , after saturating at a certain value , the hall coefficient starts to decrease and become negative .",
    "when this happens , the electrons are deeply in the ac - wannier stark ladder regime and are localized due to the strong circularly polarized light .",
    "the berry curvature peaks around the k and k points now become highly complex and the sign alters at each concentric circles as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( a ) .",
    "this leads to negative hall coefficients after integrating over the brillouin zone .     and",

    "we have studied the dependence of the photovoltaic hall effect in a honeycomb lattice . especially , we have elaborated the dependence of the photovoltaic berry curvature on the frequency @xmath46 of the applied circularly - polarized light .",
    "we have found that the photovoltaic berry curvature and thus , the hall coefficient gradually increases as @xmath46 becomes smaller reflecting the relation @xmath53 . however , even when @xmath46 is large and the dirac band approximation breaks down , we found evidence that the photovoltaic hall effect survives , which indicates that this is not limited to dirac bands but the effect is more universal and can be realized in a wide range of electron systems in circularly polarized light .    to was supported by grant - in - aid for young scientists ( b ) .",
