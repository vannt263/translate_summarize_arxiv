    "but if the objective is to evaluate a single forecasting method , the value itself reported by a measure of forecast accuracy does not allow us to assess how good / bad such method is , since it is made for comparison purposes , it is a _ relative _ rather than an _ absolute _ measure for the forecasting quality of the predictive model in question .    in the present work a statistical test",
    "is proposed to decide whether a single forecasting method should be rejected or not as accurate , based on the _ geometric mean _ of the ratios of observed / forecasted values , in the particular case when all the involved quantities are strictly positive .",

    "in case the lognormality assumption of the ratios observed versus forecasted is not rejected by the shapiro - wilk normality test applied to the log - ratios , the proposed accuracy test shows a better power performance than the binomial test , and since it is based on a sufficient statistic for the hypothesis of interest it would be expected to have a good performance compared to some other test .    in case",
    "the normality of the log - ratios is rejected , there is still the possibility of trying with the more general box - cox ( 1964 ) transformation @xmath194 for some @xmath195 ( recall that the limit of this transformation when @xmath196 is @xmath197 ) .",
    "an example where the ratios are not lognormal was analyzed ( a ratio of gamma random variables ) and the power of the proposed accuracy test seems to be still better than the binomial test , but a more thorough analysis could be made in future work in order to assess the robustness of the proposed test under some other kind of departures from lognormality .",
    "but as stated in johnson _",
    "et al._(1994 ) , even without the lognormality assumption , if @xmath30 are independent and continuous positive random variables , and if the independent random variables @xmath33 are such that a central limit type of result applies , then the standardized distribution of @xmath198 would tend to a standard normal distribution as @xmath35 tends to infinity , and the limiting distribution of the sample geometric mean @xmath40 would then be lognormal , and the proposed accuracy test may be applied .",
