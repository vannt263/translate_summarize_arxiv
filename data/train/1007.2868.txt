    "quantum mechanics predicts that a bound state that is sufficiently close to a 2-body threshold and that couples to that threshold through a short - range s - wave interaction has universal properties that depend only on its binding energy .",
    "such a bound state is necessarily a loosely - bound molecule in which the constituents are almost always separated by more than the range .",
    "one of the universal predictions is that the root - mean - square ( rms ) separation of the constituents is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the binding energy of the resonance and @xmath4 is the reduced mass of the two constituents . as the binding energy is tuned to zero , the size of the molecule increases without bound .",
    "a classic example of a loosely - bound s - wave molecule is the deuteron , which is a bound state of the proton and neutron with binding energy 2.2  mev .",
    "the proton and neutron are correctly predicted to have a large rms separation of about 3.1  fm .",
    "an even more ideal example of a loosely - bound s - wave molecule is the charmonium - like state @xmath0 , provided that its @xmath5 quantum numbers are @xmath6 .",
    "measurements of its mass in the decay mode @xmath7 indicate that it is below the threshold for @xmath8 by @xmath9  mev @xcite .",

    "the production rate of a deuteron or anti - deuteron in high energy collisions is an important problem for several reasons .",
    "anti - deuterons can be produced by the annihilation or decay of very massive dark - matter particles .",
    "thus they provide a low - background channel for the indirect detection of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the production of deuterons and anti - deuterons has been observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "their production serves as a probe of the expanding and cooling hadronic fluid at the time of its freeze - out into free - streaming hadrons .",
    "the production of an anti - deuteron has also been observed in many high energy physics experiments , including @xmath1 decays @xcite , @xmath12 collisions @xcite , photoproduction @xcite , @xmath13 decays @xcite , and deep inelastic electron scattering @xcite .",
    "to explain the production rate quantitatively in these experiments is a challenge .",
    "the production rate of the @xmath0 is important for understanding the nature of some of the new @xmath14 mesons above the open charm threshold that have been discovered in recent years @xcite .",
    "thus far , the @xmath0 has been observed only in decays of @xmath15 mesons and through inclusive production in @xmath12 collisions .",
    "it has been claimed that the observed prompt production rate of the @xmath0 at the tevatron is orders of magnitude too large to be compatible with its identification as a loosely - bound s - wave molecule @xcite . a subsequent analysis challenged this conclusion @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the controversy has important implications for studies of the @xmath0 in experiments at the large hadron collider .    estimating the production rate of a loosely - bound s - wave molecule in high energy collisions is also an interesting problem .",
    "intuitively , one expects the cross section to be very small , because one would expect the binding of the constituents into a molecule to be easily disrupted by the enormous energies available in a high energy collision . on the other hand ,",
    "since the constituents of the molecule are almost always outside the range of their interactions , they must be subject to a very strong force during the small fraction of time in which they are close together .",
    "this strong force also operates between constituents that are produced with small relative momentum in a high energy collision .",
    "the production rate of the molecule involves the interplay between this very strong force and the very weak binding .",
    "one tool that can be helpful in estimating the production rate of a loosely - bound s - wave hadronic molecule is a hadronic event generator , such as pythia @xcite or herwig @xcite .",
    "these event generators can be interpreted as purely phenomenological models for hadron production with numerous parameters that have been adjusted to fit data from many high energy physics experiments .",
    "they should provide accurate predictions for observables that are sufficiently similar to the ones that have been used to tune the parameters , but one should be wary of applying them to new phenomena",
    ". they may be able to take into account the effects of generic hadronic interactions , but they should not be expected to take into account the effects of finely - tuned interactions , such as those responsible for the existence of loosely - bound hadronic molecules .",
