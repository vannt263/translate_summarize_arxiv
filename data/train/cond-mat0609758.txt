    "recently , the suggestion @xcite that the two consecutive phase transitions experimentally observed @xcite in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 should be interpreted as `` orbital - selective mott transitions '' ( osmts ) sparked a cascade of related theoretical papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "microscopic studies of osmts usually consider the 2-band hubbard model @xmath3 , where @xmath4 include hopping between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath5 with amplitude @xmath6 for orbital @xmath7 , _",
    "intra_- and _ _ inter__orbital coulomb repulsion parametrized by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , and ising - type hund s exchange coupling ; @xmath10 for spin @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 contains spin - flip and pair - hopping terms ( with @xmath13 , @xmath14 etc . ) . as in @xcite",
    ", we refer to @xmath15 with the isotropic coupling @xmath16 as the @xmath17-model and to the simplified hamiltonian @xmath18 as the @xmath19-model ; unless noted , @xmath20 , @xmath21 so that @xmath22 .",
    "early theoretical studies suggested that the expected 2 distinct osmts occur only in the full @xmath17 model @xcite , but not in the ising type @xmath19-model @xcite .",
    "thus , it seemed as if spin - flip and pair - hopping terms were essential ingredients to orbital - selective physics .",
    "however , this is not actually the case , as shown in a low - frequency analysis of high - precision qmc data @xcite in fig .",

    "[ z - liebsch]b ) .",
    "possible signals from this transitions can not be distinguished from numerical errors in earlier qmc data @xcite ( squares ) since they exceed @xmath31 at both transitions ( fig .",
    "[ z - liebsch]c ) .",
    "clearly , the resolution of two orbital - selective mott transitions with critical interactions differing by only about @xmath32 is a very challenging task , in particular at temperatures attainable using qmc . in this situation ,",
    "much insight can be gained by abandoning the constraint @xmath22 fulfilled in nearly all earlier studies and instead studying the limit of small inter - orbital coupling .",
    "hence , we consider @xmath33 with @xmath34 so that @xmath35 corresponds to uncoupled orbitals and @xmath36 to the case studied previously .    it is a priori clear , that for @xmath35 each orbital should undergo a usual mott transition at an interaction determined by the corresponding bandwidth ( @xmath37 for the narrow , @xmath38 for the wide band ) ; note however , that even in this case the qmc results for both orbitals have no scaling relation at fixed @xmath39 .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] :    , the wide - band transition remains first order ( with hysteresis ) for small enough inter - orbital coupling @xmath40 . ]    for @xmath35 , a large hysteresis region appears in the wide - band quasiparticle weight ( uppermost , grey line ) while only a single coexistence point is resolved for the narrow band ( at @xmath41 ) .",
    "very importantly , the wide - band transition evidently remains first order at small , but significant inter - orbital coupling ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "it may be expected that the first - order range ( in @xmath44 ) increases at lower temperatures which suggests that the wide - band osmt might be very weakly first order even at @xmath36 . however",
    ", the alternative of a quantum phase transition at some critical value @xmath45 is equally interesting and warrants further investigation .",
    "as shown above , the ( discretely estimated ) quasiparticle weight @xmath46 is not well suited for detecting the second osmt .",

    "however , this observable decays to 0 for @xmath49 in the osm phase .",
    "naively , one might conclude that the osm phase becomes indistinguishable from the insulating phase for @xmath52",
