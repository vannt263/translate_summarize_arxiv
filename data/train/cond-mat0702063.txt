    "strong localization of electrons in quantum dots ( qds ) may enhance the hyperfine interaction of electron spins with those of nuclei .  @xcite various aspects of the hyperfine interaction of electron and nuclear spins have been studied for last three decades in different materials ,  @xcite including inp qds .",
    "@xcite charge - tunable inp qds with one resident electron per dot , on an average , have recently attracted considerable research interest due to the observation of submillisecond spin lifetime of resident electrons in these qds .",
    "@xcite this observation makes it a promising candidate for quantum memory element in the emerging fields of quantum information technology and spintronics .",
    "@xcite application of qds as the building blocks of quantum computers has been proposed .",
    "@xcite    however , the influence of the hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins , on the long - lived electron spin polarization needs to be clarified .",
    "two effects of the electron - nuclear spin - spin interactions may be considered .",
    "one of them is the so - called dynamic nuclear polarization .",
    "@xcite in the optical orientation of electron spins in semiconductors by circularly polarized photons , the spin - oriented electrons dynamically polarize the nuclear spins due to the hyperfine coupling of the electron and nuclear spin subsystems .",
    "@xcite in turn , the spin - polarized nuclei produce an effective internal magnetic field ( the overhauser field @xmath7 ) , which may influence the electron spin dynamics . in presence of an external magnetic field @xmath8",
    ", electron spins should feel a total magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "another important effect of the electron - nuclear hyperfine coupling is the electron spin relaxation via its interaction with nuclear spins .",
    "@xcite at low temperature , relaxation of the coupled electron - nuclear spin system is determined by three processes , namely , i ) electron spin precession in the frozen fluctuations of the hyperfine field of the nuclear spins , ii ) nuclear spin precession in the hyperfine field of the electron spins , and iii ) nuclear spin relaxation in the dipole - dipole field of its nuclear neighbors .",
    "these three processes have very different characteristic timescales .",
    "theoretical estimate for gaas qds containing @xmath10 nuclei suggest them to be @xmath11  ns , @xmath11  @xmath2s , and @xmath12  @xmath2s , respectively .  @xcite the last one of the above processes will not be considered further in this paper , because it affects the electron spin dynamics over a long timescale of @xmath13@xmath14  s. in this long time - regime many other mechanisms , such as those originating from the spin - orbit coupling and interaction with phonons become important for electron spin relaxation .",
    "the first relaxation process mentioned above arises from the fact that due to a large , but limited number of nuclear spins , typically @xmath15 , interacting with the electron spin in a qd , random correlation of nuclear spins may create a fluctuating nuclear polarization , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total spin of the polarized nuclei .",
    "fluctuation @xmath18 acts on the electron spin as another internal magnetic field @xmath19 , with random magnitude and orientation over the qd ensemble .",
    "@xcite we may note that the larmor precession of the nuclear spins in the hyperfine field of an electron spin is much slower than that of the electron spin in the nuclear hyperfine field , because the interaction of an electron spin with a single nucleus is @xmath20 times weaker compared to its interaction with the effective magnetic field of the nuclear fluctuations .",
    "thus , the electron `` sees '' a snapshot of the `` frozen fluctuations '' of the nuclear field . electron spin precession in the magnetic field @xmath19 is expected to cause electron spin relaxation in the qd ensemble in a timescale of the order of 1  ns , during which the electron spin polarization decays to one - third of its initial value .",
    "after the initial decay in the nanosecond timescale , the remaining spin polarization relaxes very slowly over a timescale much longer than the radiative lifetime of the electron - hole pair .",
    "@xcite    electron spin relaxation due to the frozen fluctuations of nuclear spins ( ffns ) may be suppressed by a longitudinally ( along the optical excitation axis ) applied magnetic field with a magnitude larger than @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite recent study of electron spin relaxation in @xmath21-doped inas qds by braun _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that at zero external magnetic field , electron spin polarization decays down to one - third of its initial value within 800  ps after photo - excitation .",
    "then the residual spin polarization remains stable with no measurable decay within the photoluminescence ( pl ) decay time .",
    "the authors found that the initial fast relaxation of electron spin was suppressed by the application of a small ( @xmath22  mt ) external magnetic field .",
    "we want to note the fact that for @xmath23 , _ two distinctly different time regimes are present _ in the electron spin relaxation .",
    "@xcite the initial fast relaxation is caused by the random distribution of @xmath19 in the qd ensemble .",
    "@xcite however , _ a total depolarization of electron spins does not take place _ in this regime .",
    "the residual electron spin polarization decays very slowly in a second relaxation regime , which is governed by the slow time - varying change in the distribution of @xmath19 .",
    "this slow change in the distribution of @xmath19 is caused by the variation in the precession rate of nuclear spins in the hyperfine field of electrons .",
    "@xcite we denote it as the nuclear spin precession effect ( nspe ) .",
    "study of electron spin relaxation due to the nspe in the microsecond time - range should give an estimate of the nuclear spin precession period @xmath0 in the hyperfine field of electrons .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this has not been experimentally studied so far .    in this paper",
    "we describe our experimental study of nuclear spin effects on the long - lived spin polarization of resident electrons , observed recently  @xcite in the singly negatively charged inp qds .",
    "electron spin dynamics and the influence of nuclear spins on it , are probed by the time - resolved as well as time - integrated measurements of the degree of pl circular polarization @xmath24 , defined quantitatively in sec .  [ expt ] .",
    "our time - domain measurements of @xmath24 by using a pl pump - probe technique  @xcite in the microsecond time - regime reveal electron spin relaxation via the nspe at the vanishing external magnetic field . from the value of the electron spin decay time @xmath25 for @xmath26",
    ", we estimate that @xmath27  @xmath2s at @xmath3  k , comparable to the theoretical estimate available for gaas qds .",
    "@xcite we also measure the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath8 in time - integrated measurements at @xmath3  k. from these steady - state measurements we obtain the overhauser field @xmath28  mt at 50  mw cw excitation and the effective magnetic field of the ffns , @xmath29  mt , independent of the excitation power . the relatively small value of @xmath7 may come from efficient leakage of qd nuclear spin polarization to the surrounding lattice nuclei .",
    "our sample consists of a single layer of self - assembled inp qds , embedded between ga@xmath30in@xmath30p barriers grown on a @xmath31-gaas substrate .",
    "the average base diameter ( height ) of the qds is @xmath32 ( 5 )  nm and the areal density of dots is @xmath33  @xmath34 . semi - transparent indium - tin - oxide electrode is deposited on top of the sample to control the charge state of the qds by means of an applied electric bias .",
    "@xcite for the present study on the singly negatively charged qds we apply an electric bias of @xmath35  v. this is because it was found from a previous study of trionic quantum beats  @xcite on the same sample that at @xmath36  v the qds contain one resident electron per dot , on an average .",
    "electron spins in the qd ensemble are polarized in our experiments by using the well - known optical orientation technique .  @xcite we excite the qds _ quasiresonantly _ ( in the excited state of the qds , but below the wetting layer bandgap ) by circularly polarized beam from a ti : sapphire laser , which can be operated either in cw or in pulsed mode .",
