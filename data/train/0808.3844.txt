    "among many attempts to understand quantum theory axiomatically , an operationally natural approach has attracted increasing attention in the recent development of quantum information theory @xcite . by constructing a general framework of theories to include not only classical and quantum theories but also more general theories",
    ", one can reconsider the nature of quantum theory from outside , preferably with the operational and informational point of view .",
    "this also enables us to prepare for a ( possible ) post - quantum theory in the future .",
    "for instance , it is important to find conditions to achieve a secure key distribution in a general framework @xcite . among others ,",
    "the convexity or operational approach @xcite , or recently referred as ",
    "general ( or generic ) probabilistic theories ( or models ) \" @xcite , is considered to provide operationally the most general theory for probability .",
    "of course , both classical probability theory and quantum theory are included as typical examples of general probabilistic theories , but it is known that there exist other possible physical models for probability ( see an example in sec .",
    "iv b ) .",
    "although this approach has relatively long history @xcite , there are still many fundamental problems especially from the applicational and informational points of view to be left open",
    ". this may not be surprising if one recalls that quantum information theory has given new insights and provided attractive problems on the foundation and application of quantum mechanics .",
    "one of them is a state discrimination problem .",
    "the problem asks how well a given ensemble of states is distinguishable .",
    "it has been one of the most important questions in quantum information theory , and there are various formulations of the problem depending on measures to characterize the quality of discrimination @xcite .",
    "the property that there is no measurement perfectly distinguishes non - orthogonal pure states plays an essential role in the various protocols such as quantum key distribution @xcite , and is often considered as the most remarkable feature of quantum theory . on the other hand ,",
    "in the context of general probabilistic theories , the property can characterize the nature of classical theory .",
    "indeed , it is known that a general probabilistic theory is a classical theory if and only if all the pure states can be perfectly discriminated in a single measurement @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss an optimal state discrimination problem in general probabilistic theories by means of bayesian strategy .",
    "while the existence of bayes optimal measurements has been discussed in general setting @xcite , we provide a geometrical method to find such optimal measurement and optimal success probability .",
    "our figure of merit is the optimal success probability , in discriminating @xmath1 numbers of states under a given prior distribution .",
    "we introduce a useful family of ensembles , which we call a _ helstrom family of ensembles _ , in any general probabilistic theories , which generalizes a family of ensembles used in @xcite in @xmath0-level quantum systems for binary state discrimination , and show that the family enable us to obtain optimal measurements by means of bayesian strategy .",
    "this method reveals that a certain geometrical relation between state space and the convex subset generated by states which we want to distinguish is crucial for the problem of state discrimination : in the case of uniform prior distribution , what one has to do is to find as large convex subset ( composed of helstrom family of ensembles ) as possible in state space which is reverse homothetic to the convex subset generated by states under consideration .",
    "the existences of the helstrom families for @xmath2 which again have a simple geometrical interpretation are shown in both classical and quantum systems in generic cases .",
    "some other works on the problem in quantum theory are related with our purpose ; the no - signaling condition was used in deriving the optimal success probability @xcite between two states in @xmath0-level quantum systems , a bound of the optimal success probability @xcite and a maximal confidence @xcite among several non - orthogonal states in general quantum systems . in particular",

    "[ example 5 : state discrimination of pure states ] since @xmath312 is not a simplex , and thus not a classical system , four pure states can not be discriminated in a single measurement .",

    "it turns out that this weak helstrom family is a helstrom family , and thus we obtain @xmath336 to discriminate all pure states in this system .",

    "in this paper , we introduced a notion of a ( weak ) helstrom family of ensembles in general probabilistic theories and showed the close relation with state discrimination problems .",

    "we illustrated our method in @xmath0-level quantum systems and reproduced the helstrom bound for binary state discrimination and symmetric quantum states .",
