    "<S> an electrical study of thin @xmath0 films in the vicinity of the structural phase transition at @xmath1 shows ( a ) that the electrical resistance @xmath2 follows @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 over the @xmath6-range , @xmath7 covering both sides of the structural transition , and ( b ) a history dependent hysteresis loop in @xmath2 upon thermal cycling . </S>",
    "<S> these features are attributed here to transport through a granular network .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 phase of the transition - metal - oxide vanadium - oxide undergoes a structural monoclinic- to tetragonal- phase transition in the vicinity of @xmath8 , which brings with it a band - realignment and an insulator - to - metal transition including , in high quality single crystals , orders - of - magnitude changes in the electrical resistance , and a dramatic alteration in the infrared optical transmission.@xcite this interesting electronic - phase - transition has been attributed both to the peierls - type period doubling lattice distortion , and an electron interaction induced mott transition.@xcite from a practical perspective , these large changes in the electrical and optical properties near room temperature have suggested @xmath0 as a smart material in future electro - optic applications . </S>",
    "<S> studies have already shown that a large applied electrical bias@xcite or intense photoexcitation@xcite can trigger the electrical transition even below the structural transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the electrical transition can be very fast , @xmath9 , in thin films and small particles.@xcite this confluence of practical and scientific interest have motivated investigations that aim to better understand the basics , and simultaneously obtain control over the insulator - metal transition , independent of the structural transition .    here , we characterize and study thin films , which have thus far generally exhibited less dramatic changes than single crystals over the above mentioned transition(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , thin films of @xmath0 were deposited by electron beam evaporation of @xmath0 pellets , onto photolithographically patterned rectangular windows ranging from 200@xmath10 x 400 @xmath10 down to 50@xmath10 x 12.5 @xmath10 , on r - plane sapphire substrates.@xcite the film thickness was 350 nm . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath0 liftoff , cr / au was thermally evaporated onto contact - pad - windows in the photoresist , and this was followed by metal liftoff . </S>",
    "<S> the contact fabrication was completed by a slow thermal anneal at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the reported @xmath2 vs. @xmath6 and the @xmath12 measurements were carried in a two - terminal configuration . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the resistance was collected during both the up sweep and the down sweep of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 measurements were carried out concurrently at a series of fixed @xmath6 , with the bias ramped in both directions ; these results were insensitive to the bias sweep direction .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(a ) shows the resistance , @xmath2 , of a @xmath13 long @xmath14 @xmath15 wide film . </S>",
    "<S> this trace shows the electrical switching from a monoclinic , high resistance , nominally `` insulating '' state to a tetragonal , lower resistance , nominally `` metallic '' state , and the switching occurs occurs at a higher temperature on the up sweep- than on the down sweep- of @xmath6.@xcite other notable features observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) are ( i ) a difference in the base temperature resistance at the outset- and at the end- of the measurement , ( ii ) an approximate linear decrease of the resistance with increasing @xmath6 on the low-@xmath6 , high resistance side of the transition in the @xmath3 vs @xmath6 plot , and ( iii ) a similar @xmath6 dependence of @xmath2 on the high-@xmath6 , low - resistance side of the structural transition .    </S>",
    "<S> concurrent @xmath12 measurements are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and 1(c ) , with fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) showing the low bias @xmath12 data obtained during the @xmath6 up sweep and @xmath6 down sweep , respectively . over the measured range , </S>",
    "<S> the current @xmath16 increases linearly with the applied bias and the extracted @xmath2 are consistent with the fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> an observable feature in the measurements of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) is that the slope of the @xmath12 curves changes rapidly with @xmath6 over the phase transition , and the associated @xmath6-interval is dependent upon the @xmath6 sweep direction , consistent with the hysteretic transport of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) </S>",
    "<S> .    devices of different lengths were photolithographically fabricated on the same substrate in order to facilitate length - dependence studies . </S>",
    "<S> measurements are exhibited in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , for a 400@xmath10 , a 200@xmath10 , and a @xmath17 long strip , with a width , @xmath18 . the noteworthy features in these data are once again that ( i ) in each case , the room temperature resistance after thermal cycling exceeds the initial room temperature resistance at the outset of the experiment , ( ii ) the width in @xmath6 of the hysteresis loop does not depend upon the length of the device , see also fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , ( iii ) in the low temperature phase , i.e. , below @xmath19 , the @xmath6 variation of @xmath2 is linear in this @xmath3 vs @xmath6 plot , similar to the data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , and ( iv ) the same behavior continues onto the high temperature tetragonal , nominally `` metallic '' @xmath0 phase , immediately above the structural transition .    </S>",
    "<S> identical devices on the same substrate also showed similar @xmath20 behavior on both sides of the structural transition ; this is illustrated by the data of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) for a pair of @xmath21 long @xmath14 @xmath17 wide devices .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , these measurements indicate an increase of the base temperature resistance upon thermal cycling . a close examination of such behavior revealed , in addition , a change in the width of the hysteresis loop , as exhibited in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , especially over the first few thermal cycles . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(b ) shows that the width of the hysteresis loop in the initial thermal cycle formed by the up sweep trace @xmath22 and the down - sweep trace @xmath23 measurements is roughly a factor of two smaller than width of the hysteresis loop observed in the second thermal cycle constituted by traces @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure also shows that @xmath26 in these measurements increases as one proceeds from data trace @xmath22 to @xmath23 to @xmath24 to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there appears to be a correlation between the increase in the base temperature @xmath2 upon thermal cycling and the broadening of the hysteresis loop over the range of @xmath6 characterizing the structural transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we present here a qualitative explanation , which builds upon earlier results . </S>",
    "<S> berglund and guggenheim reported long ago that single crystals of @xmath0 , and many other materials that exhibit a structural transition , include a tendency to fissure upon passing through the phase transition.@xcite the literature also demonstrates a strong correlation between the width of the hysteresis loop and the size of @xmath0 particles or grains in the @xmath0 system . </S>",
    "<S> most recently , it has been shown that ensembles of nanometer sized particles exhibit a substantial hysteresis loop upon cycling through the transition,@xcite and this behavior was attributed to the reduced number of transition - triggering nucleation sites in smaller particles , and the consequent spread in transition temperatures in an ensemble of such small particles . </S>",
    "<S> the previous report of a wider hysteresis loop in smaller particles suggests the interpretation here that the increasing width of the hysteretic loop with repeated thermal cycling , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , originates from a reduction in the average grain size in thin films upon thermal cycling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the electrical response of these @xmath0 films seems to be a signature of transport through a granular network , and the increase in the base temperature resistance with thermal cycling seems to reflect the increased resistance in a grain - boundary dominated percolating network , as the grains become smaller , within a given device .    </S>",
    "<S> = 2.8 in    the other remarkable feature of these measurements on thin films is the similarity of the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath2 on both sides of the structural transition . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is in sharp contrast to the behavior observed in high quality single crystals , where the structural transition brings with it also a metal - insulator transition.@xcite note that the insulating state often exhibits activated transport , @xmath27 , and a divergent resistance in the @xmath28 limit , while the metallic state typically exhibits a finite @xmath2 in the @xmath29 limit . </S>",
    "<S> the observation in these experiments of a similar non - activated _ and _ non - metallic @xmath6-dependence on _ both _ sides of the structural transition is therefore surprising . </S>",
    "<S> this feature suggests , perhaps , the absence of a true metallic state in these thin films .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest here the conjecture that effective localization through the formation of small grains helps to transform the nominally `` metallic '' state into a disorder mediated , relatively high resistance state with the @xmath20 characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis was advanced long ago that , in disordered single crystals , `` the so - called metallic phase [ in @xmath0 ] is not metallic at all''.@xcite in that instance , mott@xcite was referring to data@xcite from specimens showing just a one - to - two orders - of - magnitude change in @xmath2 over the structural transition . perhaps , the disordered thin films examined in this study are physically similar to the single crystals then considered . </S>",
    "<S> the uniform temperature dependence then appears plausible here , however , if the @xmath6-dependence of the coupling within the granular network sets the temperature dependence of the resistance on both sides of the structural transition .    </S>",
