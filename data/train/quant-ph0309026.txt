    "the analysis of ground state properties of spin systems in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions is a contemporary issue in statistical physics and condensed matter physics .",
    "these systems display a rich variety of phenomena which explain many exotic properties of materials at very low temperature .",
    "very recently , it has been recognized that cold atoms in optical lattices can be very well described in terms of certain spin hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "these systems can be very well controlled at the quantum level , which may allow us to observe physical phenomena predicted for spin systems and that have , so far , not been observed with other systems .",
    "moreover , they may allow to build a quantum simulator which may shed some light in unresolved issues in condensed matter physics  @xcite .    in the strong interacting regime and at sufficiently low temperature",
    ", atoms confined in optical lattices tend to distribute in the so  called mott phase ; that is , under the appropriate conditions each lattice site is occupied by a single atom .",
    "each atom still interacts with the nearest neighbor via virtual tunneling , which gives rise to an effective interaction between the internal levels of neighboring atoms . under certain conditions",
    ", these interactions can be described in terms of the ising model or the anisotropic heisenberg model with a transverse magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "changing the laser parameters amounts to varying the parameters of these models .",
    "both models display quantum phase transitions  @xcite for certain values of these parameters .",
    "thus , with these systems it is possible to investigate the dynamics of quantum phase transitions by , for example , adiabatically changing these laser properties .",
    "an important question in this case is to what extent the process can remain adiabatic since near a phase transtion the energy levels tend to get closer as the number of particles increases  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study this problem for both hamiltonians .",
    "for the exactly solvable ising model , the adiabatic process will be investigated in detail and analytical results for the excitation probability will be given .",
    "for the yet unsolved anisotropic heisenberg model , the adiabatic process will be investigated by means of perturbation theory .",
    "another subject in which the results about adiabatic processes in spin - systems are relevant is adiabatic quantum computation  @xcite . in adiabatic quantum computation , solutions to mathematical and physical problems",
    "are obtained by simulating adiabatic processes on quantum computers  @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem related to adiabatic quantum computation is the investigation of the ground state of spin - systems .",
    "this problem is known to be difficult to be solved on classical computers , since the required resources in time and space scale _ exponentially _ with the number of particles the system consists of .",
    "because of this exponential scaling , the ground state properties can only be obtained for spin - systems consisting of a few dozens of particles .",
    "in addition to that , analytical calculations are rarely possible , such that ground state properties of many spin - systems are still unknown . the question whether the ground state of spin - systems can be investigated efficiently by means of adiabatic quantum computation",
    "is related to the question how slowly parameters of the system must be changed such that processes remain adiabatic .",
    "this question will be answered in detail for the quantum ising model . even though this model is exactly solvable and",
    "its ground state is known , the results about this model shed light on the efficiency of adiabatic quantum algorithms investigating the ground state of more complicated spin - systems . in the case of the anisotropic heisenberg model , statements about the efficiency will be made in regimes amenable to perturbative treatment .",
    "the investigation of the ground state of spin - systems by adiabatic quantum computation is an example for a quantum algorithm that is feasible with current technology : this algorithm only requires a low number of qubits , of the order of  @xmath0 , in order to exceed classical computations .",
    "in addition , as we will show , the algorithm is sufficiently robust against errors and imperfections , such that no quantum error correction codes are necessary . on top of that",
    ", the algorithm can be implemented by any experimental realization of a universal quantum simulator  @xcite , like that based on optical lattices and arrays of microtraps  @xcite .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in the first part , general statements about the quantum ising model and the anisotropic heisenberg model are made . in the second part",
    ", the investigation of the ground state of spin - systems by adiabatic quantum computation is discussed . in the third and forth part ,",
    "adiabatic processes in the quantum ising model and the anisotropic heisenberg model are studied .",
    "the effects of perturbations on these adiabatic processes are discussed in the last part .",
    "the quantum ising chain  @xcite is a perfectly suited model for investigating adiabatic processes because it is exactly solvable and shows a quantum phase transition .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes this model reads @xmath1 the chain is assumed to be cyclic , i.e. @xmath2 . the pauli operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the spin of the @xmath6 particle in the chain .",

    "the parameter  @xmath8 is considered as a positive quantity that fixes the microscopic energy scale .",
    "@xmath9  denotes the number of particles in the chain .",
    "the diagonalization of hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hising ] ) can be performed by means of jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite .",
    "this transformation maps the pauli operators  @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 on fermi operators .",
    "the details of the diagonalization procedure can be gathered from appendix  [ sec : diagonalization ] .",
    "after diagonalization , the hamiltonian of the quantum ising model assumes a simple form , namely , @xmath13 with @xmath14 denoting the number of fermions . the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote energies of single fermions and the @xmath17 s are fermionic operators .     particles ( @xmath18 ) as a function of the transverse magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "the dotted line marks the critical point at which the quantum phase transition takes place . ]",
    "the eigenvalues of hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hising ] ) as functions of the transverse field  @xmath7 are visualized in figure  [ fig : ising : spec ] .",
    "it is easily shown that the ground state energy as a function of  @xmath7 is non - analytic at the point @xmath19 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this non - analytic point is an indication for a quantum phase transition  @xcite at the _ quantum critical point _",
    "this quantum phase transition separates two phases at zero temperature : an ordered phase for  @xmath20 and a disordered phase for  @xmath21 . in the ordered phase",
    ", the interaction between the particles aligns the spins parallel or antiparallel to the crystalline axes . in the disordered phase ,",
    "the external magnetic field induces spin - flips that destroy this order .",
    "the symmetries that hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hising ] ) possesses are the @xmath22-symmetry and the translational symmetry .",
    "the @xmath22-symmetry corresponds to a reflection of the spin - vectors at the @xmath23-axes .",
    "it is generated by the operator @xmath24 this operator possesses two different eigenvalues , @xmath25  and  @xmath26 , such that eigenstates can be classified by two different @xmath22-symmetries . in terms of fermi operators , states with an even number of fermions possess @xmath22-symmetry  @xmath25 and states with an odd number of fermions possess @xmath22-symmetry  @xmath26 .",
    "the translational symmetry is generated by the translation - operator which has the property to right - shift all product states : @xmath27 this operator possesses @xmath9 different eigenvalues  @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , such that the eigenstates can be classified by @xmath9 different translational symmetries .",
    "the anisotropic heisenberg chain  @xcite is characterized by anisotropic internal interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian that defines this model reads @xmath30 the chain is assumed to be cyclic .",
    "the properties of the interactions between the particles of the chain are described by the anisotropy - parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the strength of the external magnetic field is determined by the parameter  @xmath7 .",
    "the anisotropic heisenberg model possesses the same symmetries as the quantum ising model : the @xmath22-symmetry and the translational symmetry .",
    "thus , eigenstates can be classified by two different @xmath22-symmetries ( @xmath25  and  @xmath26 ) and by  @xmath9 different translational symmetries ( @xmath34 with @xmath29 ) .    .",
    "assumptions : @xmath18 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; the table on the right hand side gives informations about the degeneracy @xmath38 , the group - index @xmath39 and the translational - symmetry @xmath40 of each level . ]",
    "another possibility to classify the eigenstates is to classify them according to their behavior in a very strong magnetic field . in figure",
    "[ fig : heisenberg : spec ] the energies of the eigenstates are plotted as functions of the field - strength  @xmath7 . from this figure it can be gathered that the eigenstates cluster in  @xmath41 groups because of the zeeman - shifts .",
    "all states in each group have the property that they tend to the same state in the limit @xmath42 . in the @xmath43 group , for example , all states tend to a state that has all but @xmath39  spins aligned in @xmath23-direction and @xmath39  spins pointing in @xmath44-direction . all eigenstates in the @xmath43 group can be classified by a group - index  @xmath39 .",
    "this group - index is related to the @xmath22-symmetry of the states .",
    "it can be shown that states with an even group - index possess the @xmath22-symmetry  @xmath25 and states with an odd group - index possess the @xmath22-symmetry  @xmath26 .    in order to take into account that several eigenstates with group - index @xmath39 and translational symmetry @xmath40 may exist ,",
    "a third index @xmath45 is required to distinguish eigenstates with equal values for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in summary ,",
    "all eigenstates of @xmath46 can be identified by the three indices @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath45 .",
    "they will be denoted as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . evidently , the kets @xmath50 are common eigenstates of  @xmath46 , @xmath22 and  @xmath51 .",
    "before studying adiabatic processes in spin - systems , a relevant application shall be discussed : the investigation of the ground state of spin - systems with a quantum computer .",
    "this investigation could be performed by means of adiabatic quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the scheme of adiabatic quantum computation reads as follows : first , the quantum computer is prepared in the ground state of a simple _ beginning hamiltonian _ , the ground state of which is known .",
    "then , using the universal quantum simulator  @xcite , a time evolution according to a time - dependent hamiltonian  @xmath52 is simulated which adiabatically interpolates between the simple _ beginning hamiltonian _ and a complicated _ problem hamiltonian _ , the ground state of which shall be investigated .",
    "because of the adiabatic variation , the quantum computer always stays in the ground state of the time - dependent hamiltonian  @xmath52 and is finally prepared in the ground state of the complicated _ problem hamiltonian_. finally , by appropriate measurements , information about the ground state of the _ problem hamiltonian _ is obtained .",
    "evidently , in the case of spin - systems , the _ problem hamiltonian _ is the hamiltonian that describes the spin - system of interest .",
    "the ground state properties of this hamiltonian are usually interesting as functions of the strength  @xmath7 of an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , it is obvious to lay out the algorithm such that the field - strength  @xmath7 is adiabatically varied and tunes between the simple _ beginning hamiltonian _ and the _ problem hamiltonian_. the _ beginning hamiltonian _ can either be the hamiltonian of the spin - system for  @xmath53 or the hamiltonian of the spin - system for @xmath54 .",
    "the algorithm then consists either in preparing the quantum computer in the ground state for  @xmath53 and adiabatically increasing the field - strength  @xmath7 or in preparing the quantum computer in the ground state for @xmath54 and adiabatically decreasing the field - strength .",
    "the ground state for  @xmath54 is simple since it has all spins aligned in the direction of the external field . whether the ground state for  @xmath53 can be prepared or not depends on the spin - system under study .",
    "in fact , many models exist that are solvable for  @xmath53 and , in the case of these models , @xmath53 can be chosen as a starting point .",
    "the duration  @xmath51 of the algorithm is related to the change rate of the parameter  @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter  @xmath7 must be changed slowly enough , such that the time evolution remains adiabatic .",
    "the change rate can be determined mathematically by means of the adiabatic theorem  @xcite .",
    "this theorem deals with the solution of the schrdinger equation in the case of a time - dependent and slowly varying hamiltonian .",
    "the statements of the adiabatic theorem are the following : in the limit @xmath55 , the system always stays in the ground state .",
    "thus , eigenstates of the _ beginning hamiltonian _ are mapped with certainty on eigenstates of the _ problem hamiltonian _ and there is only a change in the phase . in reality , however , the duration  @xmath51 of the time evolution is finite .",
    "thus , the question that has to be answered is how large the duration  @xmath51 must be , such that , with a high probability , the system stays in the ground state . in other words , the probability that eigenstates with higher energy",
    "are excited must be negligible .    a rough criterion on the duration  @xmath51 that guarantees that the excitation probability is negligible reads  @xcite @xmath56 @xmath57 is thereby a quantity that depends on the derivative of the hamiltonian  @xmath58 with respect to  @xmath59 and @xmath60 denotes the minimum energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state of  @xmath58 .",
    "usually , @xmath57 scales polynomially with the number of particles , such that the efficiency mainly depends on the behavior of the minimum energy difference @xmath60 as a function of the particle number  @xmath9 .",
    "the energy difference usually reaches its minimum at an avoided level - crossing . at an avoided level - crossing , the ground state and the first excited state approach as the number of particles increases , such that the duration of the algorithm will always increase as the number of particles increases .",
    "the efficiency of the algorithm is then determined by the velocity with that the first two states approach .",
    "if , on the one hand , the first two states approach exponentially fast with a growing particle number , the algorithm is not efficient .",
    "if , on the other hand , the two states approach polynomially fast , the algorithm can be considered to be efficient .",
    "what is seen from this discussion is that knowledge of the spectrum of the hamiltonian  @xmath58 is required in order to make statements about the duration of the algorithm .",
    "however , the spectrum is not known , in general .",
    "if the spectrum was known , the ground state of the _ problem hamiltonian _ would be known , as well , and no quantum computer would be required to calculate it .",
    "thus , the only thing that can be done is to test the quantum algorithm on spin - systems that are solvable and see whether it is efficient or not , or to try to find estimations of the spectrum and use them to approximate the duration of the algorithm .    because of",
    "these difficulties in the mathematical determination of the duration of the algorithm , a simple experimental method is desirable that can be used to check whether a chosen change - rate is sufficient or not .",
    "an experimental method could look like this : first , the quantum computer is prepared in the ground state of the _ beginning hamiltonian _ , e.g. the hamiltonian of the spin - system for @xmath53 .",
    "then , the field - strength  @xmath7 is increased with a chosen change rate up to a desired value and decreased again with the same change rate . at the end",
    ", a measurement in the eigenbasis of the _ beginning hamiltonian _ is performed ( which is known ) . from this measurement",
    "it can be deduced whether the quantum computer is still in the ground state or whether levels with higher energy have been excited .",
    "if the quantum computer is still in the ground state , the time evolution was adiabatic and the change rate was low enough .",
    "otherwise , the change rate must be decreased and the experimental check must be performed once again .",
    "the adiabatic process under study consists in the slow variation of the strength of the magnetic field that environs the ising chain , i.e. the slow variation of parameter  @xmath7 in hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hising ] ) .",
    "this variation leads to excitations of states that possess the same symmetry as the initial state of the system ( which is assumed to be the ground state ) .     as functions of @xmath7 .",
    "the assumed number of particles @xmath9 is @xmath61 . ]",
    "the symmetries of the problem are , as discussed in section  [ sec : ising ] , the @xmath22-symmetry and the translational symmetry .",
    "@xmath22-symmetry imposes that only states consisting of an even number of fermions are excited .",
    "translational symmetry makes further restrictions .",
    "the states that are excited in first order can be identified by means of the adiabatic approximation  @xcite .",
    "they read @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the energies of these states with respect to the ground state energy are plotted in figure  [ fig : myalgising : wn0 ] as functions of the field - strength  @xmath7 .",
    "this figure shows that the energy difference between the lowest excited state and the ground state tends to a minimum at the critical point  @xmath19 .",
    "the minimum energy difference thereby amounts to @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "this observation already allows to make a qualitative statement about the duration of an adiabatic time evolution in the vicinity of the critical point : since , according to formula  ( [ eqn : adiabatic : t ] ) , the duration scales with @xmath66 , where @xmath60 is the minimal energy difference between the lowest exited state and the ground state , the duration can be expected to scale with @xmath67 , i.e. with the square of the number of particles .",
    "this has the consequence that , for example , the investigation of the ground state of the quantum ising model in the vicinity of the critical point by means of adiabatic quantum computation will be efficient .",
    "these qualitative results can be clarified by calculating the excitation probabilities  @xmath68 for all states  @xmath69 .",
    "this can be done analytically by making use of the adiabatic approximation  @xcite .",
    "the details of the analytical calculation can be gathered from appendix  [ sec : calculation_ising ] . another way to calculate the excitation probabilities  @xmath68 consists in numerically solving the heisenberg equations for the fermi - operators  @xmath70 . using this solution ,",
    "it is simple to calculate expectation values of arbitrary observables after the adiabatic process .",
    "if it is assumed that the final state of the system is a superposition of the ground state and the @xmath71-fermion states  @xmath69 only , the excitation probabilities  @xmath68 can be calculated as well , since they are expressible in terms of expectation values of the operators @xmath72 .     of the levels @xmath69 in the case of @xmath73 particles ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "the problem that arises is that perturbations usually break the symmetry of the original hamiltonian , such that , in principle , excitations of levels with very low energy may occur .",
    "the question that has to be answered in this connection is whether these excitations spoil previous results or not .    in the case of the quantum ising model , the answer to this question",
    "can be found using time - dependent perturbation theory with respect to the perturbation .",
    "the perturbation is thereby assumed to be given by @xmath121 if the adiabatic process consists in the slow decrease of the field - strength  @xmath7 from @xmath87 to @xmath122 , then , after crossing the critical point , this perturbation leads to a strong excitation of the ( asymptotically degenerate ) first excited state and a very small excitation of states with higher energy . nevertheless , the mean energy of the system after excitation is still very low compared to the width of the spectrum  @xmath123 , namely , @xmath124 this term does nt depend on the number of particles  @xmath9 and is negligible for @xmath125 even for large  @xmath9 .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that , even though an adiabatic process accompanied by small perturbations will not leave the system in the ground state , it will prepare the system in a state with very low temperature .",
    "such a low - temperature state also shows properties which are interesting to be investigated with a quantum computer .    in the case of the anisotropic heisenberg model ,",
    "the perturbation term is assumed to be more general , namely , @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the adiabatic process , however , is assumed to be restricted to the regime where the external magnetic field is much stronger than the internal interactions .",
    "the probability that the perturbation  @xmath129 causes an excitation during this process is then estimated  as @xmath130 where  @xmath131 is defined as @xmath132 from this formula it can be read off that the excitation - probability @xmath133 scales _ polynomially _ with the error - parameter @xmath131 and the number of particles @xmath9 .",
    "thus , small perturbations during the adiabatic process will not have severe implications .",
    "summing up , adiabatic processes have been investigated in the light of the simple , exactly solvable quantum ising model and the more complicated anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "the adiabatic processes were assumed to consist in the slow variation of the strength of the magnetic field that environs the spin - chains .    in the case of the quantum ising model , the investigation could be performed in detail and analytic results were obtained even for processes that cross the quantum critical point . in the case of the anisotropic heisenberg model , adiabatic processes were studied in regimes amenable to perturbative treatment . in both cases ,",
    "the duration of the adiabatic processes turned out to scale polynomially with the number of particles the spin - systems consist of .",
    "the results that were obtained are relevant for the treatment of bosons in optical lattices and for adiabatic quantum computation . in adiabatic quantum computation ,",
    "light is shed on the efficiency of adiabatic quantum algorithms that investigate the ground state of spin - systems . in the treatment of optical lattices , insight is gained into the dynamics of quantum phase transitions .    as an outlook on future work , adiabatic processes in more complicated , yet unsolved models , such as higher - dimensional spin - systems or spin - glasses ,",
    "could be studied , such that information is gained about quantum phase transitions in these models and about the efficiency of adiabatic quantum algorithms investigating the ground state of these models .",
    "jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite of hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hising ] ) leads to a hamiltonian consisting of two parts : a part that is quadratic in terms of fermi operators and a non - quadratic part : @xmath134 the fermi - operators  @xmath135 are chosen to be periodic , i.e. @xmath136 . the symbol @xmath14 denotes the fermion number operator which is defined as @xmath137 .",
    "even though the non - quadratic term can be neglected for many calculations because it only makes changes of order  @xmath138 to eigenvalues and eigenstates  @xcite , it is fundamental for the investigation of the quantum dynamics in the vicinity of the critical point  @xmath19 .",
    "this is because the ground state and the lowest excited state approach according to  @xmath139 in the vicinity of the critical point as the number of particles  @xmath9 increases ( see figure  [ fig : myalgising : wn0 ] ) .",
    "thus , corrections of order  @xmath138 can not be neglected even if  @xmath9 is large .",
    "since the non - quadratic term  @xmath140 is invariant under linear transformations between fermi - operators  @xcite , diagonalization can be performed separately in two subspaces consisting of an even and an odd number of fermions . in the odd - fermion - number subspace",

    "the ground state of hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hising ] ) is the vacuum - state @xmath148 in the even - fermion - number subspace .",
    "the first excited state is the @xmath25-fermion state @xmath149 lying in the odd - particle subspace .",
    "the energy difference between these two states amounts to @xmath150 for @xmath65 .",
    "this energy difference tends to zero for @xmath151 in the thermodynamic limit , which is known as asymptotic degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "adiabatic processes are conveniently treated by means of the adiabatic approximation  @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic approximation allows to calculate in first order the probability that , during an adiabatic passage , states above the ground state are excited .",
    "if it is assumed that the adiabatic process consists in the variation of the parameter  @xmath59 from  @xmath152 to  @xmath25 during time  @xmath51 , the first order excitation probabilities read @xmath153 with @xmath154 @xmath155 and @xmath156 thereby denote the @xmath157  eigenstate of @xmath58 and its corresponding eigenvalue . a definite statement about the duration of the adiabatic process",
    "is finally obtained by demanding that the overall excitation probability must be negligible , i.e. @xmath158 . in the adiabatic process investigated here",
