    "@xmath5 transition - metal oxides have attracted a considerable attention as a new paradigm of relativistic magnetic materials , whose properties are largely influenced by the strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , leading to the experimental realization and a number of theoretical proposals for such fascinating phenomena as so interaction assisted mott state in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1,@xcite spin - liquid state in pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath6 ( ref .  ) and na@xmath1ir@xmath7o@xmath8 ( refs .  ) , possible existence of topological semimetallic states in pyrochlore iridates,@xcite and unusual magnetic ordering in the honeycomb compounds na@xmath0iro@xmath7 and li@xmath0iro@xmath7,@xcite which may be relevant to the kitaev model of bond - dependent anisotropic magnetic coupling.@xcite    in this respect , a lot of attention is being focused on the properties of tetravalent iridium oxides ( or iridates ) , originating from the @xmath9-filled ir @xmath2 band , located near the fermi level .",
    "the strong so interaction splits the atomic @xmath2 states into the fully occupied fourfold degenerate @xmath10 states and twofold ( kramer s ) degenerate @xmath11 states , which accommodate one electron . in this sense , there is a clear analogy with the spin-1/2 systems and the problem of interatomic exchange interactions can be formulated in terms of some appropriately selected pseudospin states . in solids ,",
    "each group of states form the bands , which can , however , overlap with each other .",
    "moreover , since @xmath12 is the band quantum number in solids , there is always a finite hybridization between these two groups of relativistic states .",
    "the @xmath11 electrons experience the on - site coulomb repulsion and can polarize the occupied @xmath10 shell via the intraatomic exchange interactions . moreover , the precise division of the @xmath2 states into the @xmath10 and @xmath11 ones depends on the crystal - field splitting , which is typically smaller than the so coupling .",
    "these are the main ingredients , which predetermine the low - energy electronic properties of iridates .",
    "the layered perovskites , sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 , are typically regarded as the key materials for revealing the basic microscopic mechanisms , which can operate in iridates .",
    "they are also used as the benchmark materials for testing the new theoretical models . in this respect , the first and one of the most successful theoretical models for iridates",
    "was based on the theory of superexchange ( se ) interactions , which is valid in the limit of large on - site coulomb repulsion and treats the transfer integrals between the relativistic pseudospin states in the second order of perturbation theory.@xcite this model indeed reveals a rich and very interesting physics , including the bond dependence of the anisotropic exchange couplings and emergence of large antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions when the inversion symmetry is broken by the anti - phase rotations of the iro@xmath3 octahedra in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .    at the same time , there was always a question about how far one can go in applying the se model for the real iridates .",
    "for the layered iridates , this point was risen in ref .  ,",
    "where , using the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , the authors of this work have argued that the behavior of both sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 retain many aspects of slater insulators , whose insulating properties are closely related to the existence of the long - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order .",
    "the problem reemerged again recently after the experimental discovery of the magnetic ground state structure of ba@xmath0iro@xmath1,@xcite which can not be described by the se model , at least on the mean - field level.@xcite thus , the questions is whether this problem should be resolved by considering the quantum fluctuation effects , but within the se model,@xcite or revising the se model itself by including to it some new higher - order terms in the perturbation theory expansion .",
    "the answer to this question is not obvious , because in the se formulation , the effects of the so coupling are included to the transfer integral .",
    "therefore , the second - order perturbation theory with respect to the transfer integrals automatically means that it treat the so coupling also only up to the second order .",
    "if the so interaction is large ( as in iridates ) , it can be rather crude approximation , because it does not take into account several important effects , such as the in - plane anisotropy in the uniaxial systems , which may be relevant to the experimentally observed behavior of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "another interesting point is the value of nel temperature ( @xmath4 ) , which is remarkably close in both considered systems ( about @xmath13 k ) , and whether this fact can be rationalized on the basis of se theory .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to critically reexamine abilities of the se theory for the layered iridates .",
    "this is certainly not the first attempt to derive parameters of interatomic exchange interactions using the theory of se interactions and the basic ideas of this method in the case of the strong so coupling are well understood today , at least for the models.@xcite nevertheless , besides the so coupling , the behavior of interatomic exchange interactions strongly depends on the number of adjustable parameters , used in the model hamiltonians , such as the on - site coulomb and exchange interactions , tetragonal crystal - field splitting , and the matrices of transfer integrals .",
    "therefore , we believe that , in the process of derivation of the pseudospin model , it is very important to reduce the number of possible ambiguities by sticking as much as possible to the first - principles electronic structure calculations .    the rest of the article is organizes as follows . in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : conc ] , we will give a brief summary of our work .",
    "details of derivation of the non - linear sigma model for the compass heisenberg model will be given in the appendix .",
    "in this work we use the experimental structure parameters , reported in refs .   and ( at 13 k ) for ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , respectively .",

    "we will focus on the behavior of magnetically active ir @xmath2 bands , located near the fermi level and separated relatively well from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "there are two main differences between ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 :",
    "( i ) the ir @xmath2 band is narrower in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 ( the bandwidth is about about @xmath26 and @xmath27 ev in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "this is generally consistent with the additional distortion in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , which leads to the deformation of the ir - o - ir bonds ; ( ii ) the ba @xmath5 band in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 , which strongly hybridizes and , therefore , has a large weight of the ir @xmath5 states , is much closer to the fermi energy than the sr @xmath28 band in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "this is mainly related to the larger ba @xmath5 bandwidth , due to the less distorted crystal structure as well as the relativistic effects.@xcite    iro@xmath1 in lda with the so coupling .",

    "the shaded area shows the contributions of the ir @xmath5 states .",

    "( b ) band dispersion near the fermi level , as obtained for the full lda hamiltonian in comparison with the six- and two - orbital models .",
    "the high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone are denoted as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",

    ", width=566 ]    in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 , the relativistic @xmath10 and @xmath11 subbands are separated by the direct gap , which allows us to construct both 6- and 2-orbitals models ( for the entire @xmath2 bands and @xmath11 subband , respectively ) . in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , due to the additional mixing between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states , caused by the @xmath17 distortion , such separation does not take place .",
    "therefore , for sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , we will focus only on the 6-orbital model .",
    "in this section we will discuss the construction of the low - energy electron model , starting from the lda band structure with the so interaction . for practical calculations ,",
    "we use the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method in the nearly orthogonal representation.@xcite the model itself has the following form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the creation and annihilation operators of an electron on the wannier orbitals @xmath37 , centered at the ir site @xmath38 and specified by the index @xmath39 , which numbers kramer s doublets @xmath40@xmath41 , @xmath22 , or @xmath26 ( an analog of orbital indices without so coupling ) and the states @xmath42@xmath43 or @xmath22 within each such doublet ( an analog of spin indices without so coupling ) .    first , we construct the wannier functions for the magnetically active bands , using the projector - operator technique.@xcite we consider the 6-orbital model for the both ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , for ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 it is also possible to construct the 2-orbital model , by considering only two highest degenerate bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.biodos ] ) .",
    "the trial functions , which are used for the projection , were obtained from the digonalization of the site - diagonal density matrix , calculated for the magnetically active bands in the basis of ir @xmath5 orbitals.@xcite namely , after the diagonalization of the density matrix , we pick up either 6 or 2 eigenstates ( depending on the dimensionality of the model ) with the largest eigenvalues and use them as the trial functions . such construction guarantees that the wannier functions are well localized in the real space : the main part of the density matrix with the largest eigenvalues",
    "is described by the `` heads '' of the wannier functions , residing on the central site , and only small remaining part of this matrix is described by the `` tails '' of the wannier functions , coming from the neighboring ir sites .",
    "thus , the main weight of the wannier function is concentrated in its `` head '' part , while the contribution of `` tails '' is relatively small .",
    "such procedure was extensively used in nonrelativistic calculations without the so coupling.@xcite the new aspect of the relativistic formulation is that the eigenstates of the density matrix become kramers degenerate .",
    "therefore , the trial functions and the wannier functions ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) for each kramer s doublet can be chosen so to satisfy the conditions : @xmath46 and @xmath47@xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the time - reversal operation , written in terms of the spin pauli matrix @xmath50 and the complex conjugation operator @xmath51 .",
    "then , the one - electron part of the model hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hel ] ) is identified with the matrix elements of the lda hamiltonian in the wannier basis : @xmath52 .",
    "this procedure can be also reformulated as the downfolding of the lda hamiltonian.@xcite then , the site - diagonal matrix elements @xmath53 describe the splitting of the atomic levels by the crystal field and the so interaction , while the off - diagonal elements @xmath54 stand for interatomic transfer integrals ( or kinetic hoppings ) .",
    "the matrix of screened on - site interactions @xmath55 $ ] has been calculated using simplified version of the constrained random - phase approximation ( rpa).@xcite the rpa is used in the gw method in order to evaluate the momentum and frequency dependence of the screened coulomb interaction , which is then used in the calculations of the self - energy.@xcite the basic idea of constrained rpa is to switch off some contributions to the rpa polarization function ( and , therefore , to the screening of @xmath56 ) related to the transition between the magnetically active bands ( in our case , the ir @xmath5 bands).@xcite the rpa is inadequate for this channel of screening ( especially when it is evaluated starting from the lda bandstructure ) and should be replaced by a more rigorous method in the process of solution of the low - energy model ( [ eqn : hel ] ) .",
    "the purpose of additional simplifications is to replace the time - consuming rpa for the screening , caused by the relaxation of the atomic wavefunction and other ( non-@xmath5 ) states , by much faster and more suitable for these purposes constrained lda technique .",
    "after that , we consider ( within rpa ) the additional and most efficient channel of screening of the coulomb interactions in the ir @xmath5 bands by ( the same ) ir @xmath5 states , which contribute to other parts of the electronic structure ( mainly to the o @xmath57 and either ba @xmath5 or sr @xmath28 bands in figs .",
    "[ fig.biodos ] and [ fig.siodos ] ) due to the hybridization.@xcite such approximation incorporates the main channels of screening and , thus , reproduces reasonably well the values of static coulomb interactions , obtained in full - scale constrained rpa calculations .",
    "the obtained matrix elements @xmath58 have the following form : @xmath59 where the screened interaction @xmath60 in rpa is invariant under the time - reversal operation and does not depend on the spin variables .",
    "in this section we will consider the mapping of the electron model ( [ eqn : hel ] ) onto the magnetic model , formulated in terms of _ pseudospin _ variables @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the @xmath26@xmath65@xmath26 tensors , describing interactions in the system of pseudospins and with the external magnetic field @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the pseudospin operators are represented by the pauli matrices : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .    for each bond , @xmath63 can be presented as the sum of its symmetric ( @xmath70 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath71 ) components : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the part @xmath75 incorporates all types of symmetric exchange interactions and its trace is the isotropic exchange interaction in the bond @xmath38-@xmath12 : @xmath76 , while @xmath77 describes anisotropic dm interactions .",
    "@xmath77 has only three independent elements , which can be viewed as the components of some axial vectors ( the so - called dm vector ) @xmath78 : @xmath79 yielding the well known identity : @xmath80 $ ] .      in order to calculate the se interactions ,",
    "we adapt a standard procedure for the systems , whose degeneracy in the atomic limit is lifted by the crystal field and so interaction .",
    "namely , we assume that , in the atomic limit , the single hole resides on the highest kramer s doublet , obtained from the diagonalization of the site - diagonal part @xmath81 $ ] of the one - electron hamiltonian .",
    "the states @xmath82 and @xmath83 of this kramer s doublet are used for the construction of eigenstates @xmath84@xmath85@xmath86@xmath87 , @xmath84@xmath85@xmath88@xmath87 , and @xmath84@xmath85@xmath89@xmath87 of the pseudospin operators @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively . for convenience , we choose the phases of these states so that @xmath93 and @xmath94@xmath95 .",
    "let us first explain the construction for @xmath84@xmath85@xmath89@xmath87 . for these purposes , one can choose any pair of states , which is obtained by the unitary transformation of @xmath82 and @xmath83 . moreover ,",
    "since the states are degenerate , the transformation will not change the total energy , and the model ( [ eqn : hs ] ) will not contain the single - ion anisotropy term .",
    "then , we employ the fact that , despite some complications caused by the strong so coupling , the magnetic moment will always have a finite spin component , and define the pseudospin states @xmath84@xmath18@xmath89@xmath87 and @xmath84@xmath20@xmath89@xmath87 as those corresponding to , respectively , the maximal and minimal projections of spin onto the @xmath89 axis .",

    "however , this agreement is probably fortuitous .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to discuss the effect , which are not included to the regular se model .",
    "our main concern is the following : since the se model is based on the second - order perturbation theory for the transfer integrals , it implies that all effects of the so coupling , which are included to these transfer integrals , are also automatically treated only up to the second order .",
    "since the so coupling is large in iridates , this may be rather crude approximation , which does not take into account some important anisotropic interactions .",
    "for instance , in the mean - field approximation for the se model , all pseudospins in the single @xmath15 plane of ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 can rotate rigidly at no energy cost .",
    "besides quantum effects , considered in the previous section ( see also ref .  ) , this maybe related to the lack of the in - plane anisotropy , which typically appears only in the fourth order of the so coupling .    if we wanted to include these effects in the pseudospin model ( [ eqn : hs ] ) , our strategy would be to go beyond the second order perturbation theory for the transfer integrals and consider higher - order terms , which give rise to the new type of interactions , such as biquadratic and ring exchange.@xcite they will affect both anisotropic and isotropic parts of the exchange interactions .",
    "therefore , in the pseudospin formulation , based on the strong so coupling , these two types of the effects are connected with each other : if we want to consider the higher order anisotropic interactions , we have to deal with the biquadratic and ring exchange terms , which will affect all other exchange interactions , including the isotropic ones .",
    "such pseudopsin hamiltonian is no longer presented in the bilinear form ( [ eqn : hs ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the present work we take a different strategy and in order to evaluate the higher - order contributions ( and , therefore , check the validity of the se model ) in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , we solve the original electron model ( [ eqn : hel ] ) in the mean - field hf approximation , where we also apply the staggered external magnetic field , which controls the directions of the spin and orbital moments .",
    "we have found that the field of @xmath248 mev is generally sufficient for these purposes .",
    "the weak point of the hf approach is that it treats all on - site electron - electron interactions on the mean - field level , whereas in the se theory such processes are treated rigorously by solving the exact eigenstates problem for the virtual two - hole states .",

    "this deviation is the measure of biquadratic ( or ring - type ) exchange interactions , existing in the system .",
    "thus , as expected from the discussion in the beginning of this section , the higher order anisotropic effects in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 coexist with appreciable biquadratic contributions to the isotropic exchange interaction . in this sense , we obtain very consistent description for ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , we could not obtain a stable in - plane fm solution in the hf method and , thus , evaluate the in - plane elements of the exchange tensor from the total energy difference .",
    "generally , one can expect similar contribution of biquadratic interactions to the in - plane and out - of - plane components of the exchange tensor .",
    "the behavior of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 appears to be rather different from ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 . since the transfer integrals are smaller in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , while the coulomb interactions are slightly larger , it is reasonable to expect that the @xmath2 states are more localized in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , which additionally justifies the use of the se model .",
    "this is indeed what we have obtained by comparing results of hf calculations and the se model .",
    "the fact that ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 appears to be `` more itinerant '' than sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 can be seen already from the comparison of the band gap , obtained in the hf method for the afm ground state , which is substantially smaller in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 ( @xmath269 ev , against @xmath270 ev in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the hf gap is considerably larger than the experimental one , due to the lack of quantum and thermal fluctuations , as was confirmed by the dmft calculations.@xcite    first , we consider the hf solutions for the fm and afm states , where all magnetic moments are parallel to the @xmath89 axis .",
    "the total energy difference between these states is @xmath271 mev , which is much closer to the value @xmath272 mev , obtained in the se model ( the difference is about 14% , which can be again regarded as the measure of biquadratic interactions in the system ) . in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , it is practically impossible to evaluate the in - plane elements of the exchange tensor from the total energy difference : because of the dm interaction , the in - plane fm state is unstable and converges to the afm state ( with small fm canting of the magnetic moments ) .",
    "next , we consider the higher - order anisotropy effects in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 . for these purposes",

    "we have argued that this discrepancy is quite consistent with the limitations of the se model for ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 , which is the more `` itinerant '' system than sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "such `` itineracy '' is directly related to the details of the electronic structure of ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 : the lack of rotations of the iro@xmath3 octahedra and the proximity of the ba @xmath5 states to the fermi level make the @xmath2 bandwidth increase and more efficiently screen the coulomb interactions in this band .",
    "thus , the @xmath290 expansion for the magnetic energy converges slower and higher - order terms , beyond the se contributions , start to play an important role . since the effect of so interaction in the se formulation is included to the transfer integrals , the higher - order terms automatically improve the description also for the anisotropic exchange interactions .",

    "<S> layered perovskites sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 are regarded as the key materials for understanding the properties of magnetic relativistic insulators , mediated by the strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most fundamental issues is to which extent these properties can be described by the superexchange ( se ) model , formulated in the limit of the large coulomb repulsion for some appropriately selected pseudospin states , and whether these materials themselves can be classified as mott insulators . in the present work we address these issues by deriving the relevant models and extracting parameters of these models from the first - principles electronic structure calculations with the so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> first , we construct the effective hubbard - type model for the magnetically active @xmath2 bands , by recasting the problem in the language of localized wannier orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> then , we map the so obtained electron model onto the pseudospin model by applying the theory of se interactions , which is based on the second - order perturbation theory with respect to the transfer integrals . we discuss the microscopic origin of anisotropic se interactions , inherent to the compass heisenberg model , and the appearance of the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya term , associated with the additional rotation of the iro@xmath3 octahedra in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 . in order to solve the pseudospin hamiltonian problem and evaluate the nel temperature ( @xmath4 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the non - linear sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that , while for sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 our value of @xmath4 agrees with the experimental data , for ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 it is overestimated by a factor two . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this discrepancy is related to limitations of the se model : while for more localized @xmath2 states in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 it works reasonably well , the higher - order terms in the perturbation theory expansion play a more important role in the more `` itinerant '' ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 , giving rise to the new type of isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions , which are not captured by the se model . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is supported by unrestricted hartree - fock calculations for the same electron model , where in the case of ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 , already on the mean - field level , we were able to reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic ground state , while for sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 the main results are essentially the same as in the se model . </S>"
