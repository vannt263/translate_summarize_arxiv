    "recently there has been significant progress in collection and interpretation of observational data on vector magnetic fields in solar active regions which enables us to compute the values of current helicity ( a measure of departure of magnetic fields from mirror symmetry ) averaged over active regions ( seehafer 1990 ; pevtsov , canfield and metcalf 1995 ; bao and zhang 1998 ) .",
    "the data have been averaged over latitude and time in the solar cycle as well ( zhang et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the research so far has demonstrated important properties of this quantity and its regular variation in the course of the solar cycle .",
    "the helicity is generally negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern hemisphere ; the so - called hemispheric sign rule ( hsr ) for helicity .",
    "this rule , however , may occasionally be violated in the activity minimum periods ( hagino and sakurai 2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "2010 ; hao and zhang 2012 ) .",
    "helicity in the solar atmosphere has been noted as an important agent which constrains magnetic field dissipation in the solar corona .",
    "current helicity plays an important role in the solar dynamo theory as an observational proxy of the @xmath0effect as it controls a dynamical back - reaction of the magnetic field to the motion of the media which suppresses and stabilizes the generation of the magnetic field ( e.g. kleeorin et al .",
    "2003 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) . from a theoretical point of view",
    "the average helicity has the meaning of a quantity averaged over an ensemble of turbulent fluctuations in a small physical volume .",
    "this physical volume may contain a limited number of convective cells , and so we may expect it to vary significantly in space and time .",
    "the data on current helicity are indeed very fluctuating within a given active region as well as during its evolution ( zhang et al .",
    "similar fluctuations can be observed in the current helicity averaged over latitude and time in the solar cycle .    however , the observation of current helicity is a complex process which deals with initially imperfect data and involves highly non - trivial reduction processes .",
    "these difficulties must be overcome by collecting reliable datasets , because noise in the data will degrade the reliability in the analysis ( e.g. abramenko et al .",
    "1996 ; bao and zhang 1998 ; bao et al .",
    "2001 ; hagino and sakurai 2004 , 2005 ) . for better understanding of the reliability of the analysis of current helicity previously undertaken , we hereby aim to study its statistical distribution .",
    "on the other hand the current helicity as a quantity responsible for mirror asymmetry of solar magnetic field is expected to be fluctuating also from a theoretical viewpoint : a usual expectation is that the degree of mirror asymmetry in dynamo mechanisms will be about 10% .",
    "this practical estimate as originating from parker ( 1955 ) means that we have to isolate stable features of current helicity distributions on a background of physical fluctuation which may be ten times greater than the average value .",
    "this fluctuation is not due to observational uncertainties and can not be reduced by improvement of observational techniques .",
    "the expected substantial fluctuation in the current helicity data has to be carefully taken into account in estimating the averaged values of current helicity .",
    "intrinsic ( physical and true ) dispersion in the current helicity data around its mean value is , however , interesting by itself",
    ".    the probability distribution of current helicity may be substantially non - gaussian .",
    "the point is that physical processes responsible for the fluctuating nature of solar plasma can be considered as an action of a product of independent evolutionary operators rather than a sum of them resulting usually in a gaussian distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "averaging over an active region smoothes fluctuation and supports the gaussian nature of distribution .",
    "because of this , the statistical properties of current helicity deserve to be addressed in full detail .",
    "previously , the statistical distribution of current helicity has been addressed only briefly as a part of more general studies ( e.g. sokoloff et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "in this paper we consider the distribution of available data over the hemispheres of the sun and their changes over solar cycles .",
    "we compare this distribution with a gaussian and separate the part of the data which significantly deviates from a single gaussian distribution .",
    "then , we consider the spatial and temporal properties of this part in comparison with the other ( gaussian ) part of the data .",
    "we shall see that both parts exhibit similar properties and behavior over the solar cycle .",
    "this study is based on the data of photospheric vector magnetograms of solar active regions obtained at huairou solar observing station , china .",
    "the same database systematically covering 18 consecutive years ( 1988 - 2005 ) was used in zhang et al .",
    "the parameters adopted there are @xmath1 ( the average value of @xmath2;@xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( the integrated current helicity ; @xmath5 ) . in the present analysis",
    "we will use the same parameters .",
    "( the integrated current helicity ; @xmath6 ) first , we analyze the entire database that comprises 6630 magnetograms of 983 different active regions ( in terms of noaa region numbers ) .",
    "we are going to build our statistical analysis for the whole bulk of available data .",
    "the majority of active regions are represented by only one or very few magnetograms .",
    "however , there are a few active regions that were recorded in 20 or more magnetograms . in the next step we select one magnetogram for an active region . sometimes , and for some active regions that were observed within a short time interval",
    ", the helicity parameters may be close with each other .",
    "for these magnetograms , we select the one located nearest to the center of the solar disk .",
    "furthermore , we try to avoid choosing the magnetograms of rapidly emerging active regions , except for those regions which were recorded in only one magnetogram .",
    "nonetheless , this occurs rather rarely because such active regions are usually large and well observed over several days .",
    "we address the probability distribution of current helicity and its deviation from gaussian as it follows from observational data by two statistical tools .",
    "first of all , we divide the data into two hemispheres and produce histograms of the current helicity distribution for certain time intervals which contain 50 measurements .",
    "we then approximate them by multiple gaussians .",
    "in practice it appears that a mixture of two gaussians is sufficient to reproduce the histograms with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "this method , being very practical , may miss in principle substantial deviations from gaussian statistics which occurs with low probability , i.e. intermittent features in the probability distribution .",
    "a tool to address an intermittent feature is the so - called normal probability paper ( npp ) test which is organized as follows ( see , e.g. , chernoff and lieberman 1954 ) .",
    "let our set contain @xmath7 active regions .",
    "let @xmath8 active regions have current helicity density @xmath9 lower than @xmath10 .",
    "then the probability for @xmath9 to be lower than @xmath10 is estimated as @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be a gaussian variable with the same mean value @xmath13 and standard deviation @xmath14 as @xmath9 and let @xmath15 be the value for which the probability for @xmath16 to be lower than @xmath15 is @xmath17 .",
    "the results for various @xmath10 values are plotted in the @xmath18-plane and can be compared with the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) for a gaussian distribution which gives a straight line in this coordinate space . if the observational data deviate substantially from this straight line , it is an indication of a non - gaussian nature of observational data ( see e.g. sokoloff et al .",
    "2008 for details ) .    for illustration",
    "let us produce a set of random gaussian variable @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) by idl function `` randomn '' .",
    "then we produce another set of random gaussian variable @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the gauss_cvf function computes the cutoff value @xmath26 in a standard gaussian distribution with a mean of 0.0 and a variance of 1.0 such that the probability that a random variable @xmath27 is greater than @xmath26 is equal to a user - supplied probability @xmath17 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the upper panel shows the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of two gaussian components and their sum ( with equal weights ) . in the bottom panel",
    "we show the relationship between the variable and the gaussian cdf with the same mean value and standard deviation for three kinds of variables .",
    "the correlation for gaussian variables is well fit by a straight line but not for the sum of the components , as shown in figure 1 by the red curve .",
    "the slope of the straight line is determined by the mean value , and the @xmath15-intercept is determined by the standard deviation of the corresponding dataset .",
    "the entire sample includes 983 active regions , in which 464 ( 519 ) in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere , respectively .",
    "tables 14 present the detailed information about the gaussian fitting to the distribution function of the observed parameters .",
    "the columns indicate ; `` # '' : the sequence number of subgroups , `` start '' ( `` end '' ) : the earliest ( last ) measurement in the subgroup , @xmath28 : the length of the time epoch between `` start '' and `` end '' , @xmath29 and @xmath30 : the mean value and standard deviation of the subgroup , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the parameters defining the components of the sum of gaussian function in the form : @xmath37 \\\\ \\nonumber + \\frac{a_2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } \\sigma_2 } \\exp \\left [ -{\\frac{(x-\\mu_2)^2}{2\\sigma_2 ^ 2 } } \\right ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the component with subscript `` 1 '' represents the component with a greater amplitude ; @xmath38 . the fitting is not made on the pdf but is made for cdf ; the function we use for the fitting is actually the integral of equation ( 1 ) , namely the sum of two error functions .",
    "the `` error '' denotes the deviation of the observed values from the fitting with the sum of two error functions .",
    "the `` no '' column records the number of data points in each subgroup .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         the notable features common to two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 are as follows .    1 .   in the 22nd solar cycle there is an epoch of apr-26 , 1988 - feb-25 , 1990 in the southern hemisphere , in which either the first or the second component of both parameters violated the hsr .",
    "there is another epoch of jan-25 , 1992  dec-18 , 1993 in the northern hemisphere , in which the second component of both parameters violated the hsr .",
    "2 .   in the southern hemisphere of the 23rd solar cycle ,",
    "the first component violated the hsr in the epochs of may-19 , 1999  apr-12 , 2000 and oct-28 , 2003 to dec-16 , 2005 .",
    "3 .   looking at the cases of significant violation of the hsr in terms of student s error bars",
    "we note that there are very few of them compared with the the overall cases of violation of the hsr by one or two gaussian components of the bi - modal distribution .",
    "4 .   we may also note that the cases of significant violation of the hsr occur not in the maximum of the solar cycle but in the phases of rise and fall .",
    "the two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 showed disparate results as follows .    1 .   for @xmath1 in the epochs of dec-25 , 2000  sep-02 , 2001 in the northern hemisphere and jul-29 , 1993  aug-27 , 1996 in the southern hemisphere , the first component violates the hsr . also , in the epochs of sep-22 , 2001  dec-23 , 2005 in the northern hemisphere , the second component violates the hsr .",
    "these patches are not found for @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   in the southern hemisphere , the first component of @xmath39 violates the hsr in the epoch of jul-29 , 1993  aug-27 , 1996 , the second component of @xmath39 violates the hsr in the epochs of may-19 , 1999  apr-12 , 2000 and oct-22 , 2001  oct-27 , 2003 , but these are not seen for @xmath4 . in contrast , the second component of @xmath1 does not violate the hsr in the epochs of mar-08 , 1990  aug-11 , 1991 and oct-28 , 2003  dec-16 , 2005 but the second component of @xmath4 does violate the hsr during those period .",
    "3 .   the cases of significant violation of the hsr for both parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 coincide for cycle 22 but not for cycle 23 . in cycle 23",
    "there is only one case of significant violation of hsr for @xmath4 but three cases for @xmath1 .",
    "see fig .  7 for details .",
    "we have investigated to what extent the current helicity and twist data for solar active regions follow the gaussian statistics and what kind of message comes from the deviations from the gaussian distribution .    in our studies",
    "we have adopted the method of normal probability paper which has been developed for gaussian distributions .",
    "of course , there was no reason to believe that the data must be ideally distributed as a gaussian .",
    "however , such analysis has shown relative contributions of the sources of fluctuations as well as the turbulent nature of the measured quantities .",
    "quite naturally , the statistics of current helicity and twist are not exactly gaussian . here",
    "we confirmed the previous results of sokoloff et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "deviations from gaussian statistics are rather moderate and it looks often reasonable to discuss the observed statistical distribution for given space - latitude bins as a superposition of two gaussian distributions with specific means , standard deviations and amplitudes . we have not encountered cases for which such fitting is impossible or insufficient ( but see the underlined values of @xmath36 in tables 14 ) . in other words , we have not detected traces of significant intermittency in solar magnetic fields as its imprints in statistics for the current helicity or twist .",
    "we appreciate that the contemporary dynamo theory ( see a review by brandenburg , sokoloff , and subramanian 2012 ) or analysis of the surface solar magnetic tracers ( stenflo 2012 ) imply that a strong intermittency is expected .",
    "presumably , diffusive processes working during the rise of magnetic flux tubes from the solar interior up to the surface might have strongly smoothed the non - gaussian features of the distributions .",
    "formally speaking , the gaussian distribution of the current helicity was implicitly assumed when one estimates the error bars on the current helicity averaged over a time - latitude bin ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2010 ) . in practical respect",
    ", however , deviations from gaussian distribution obtained are small .",
    "due to the central limit theorem in probability theory , one may expect only minor modifications to these estimates and the non - gaussian nature of distribution can be ignored for this point .",
    "we have isolated several epochs within the time interval covered by observations where deviations from gaussian statistics look interesting and meaningful .",
    "we isolate the time bins with substantial deviations from gaussian distribution in two ways : when the main gaussian or the sub - component violates the hsr ( fig .",
    "6 ) , or when the subcomponent is comparable with the main one .    concerning the violation of the hsr ( fig .",
    "6 ) , we note a substantial north - south asymmetry in the results : main part of the bins with hsr violation belongs to the southern hemisphere . remarkably , the helicity data for the northern hemisphere for the 23rd cycle during 1997 - 2006 ( with hemispheric averages ) do not provide cases with hsr violation at all .",
    "we can summarize our main findings as follows .",
    "we have established that for the most of cases in time - hemisphere domains the distribution of averaged helicity is close to gaussian .",
    "\\2 . at the same time , at some domains ( some years and hemispheres ) we can clearly observe significant departure of the distribution from a single gaussian , in the form of two- or multi - component distributions .",
    "we are inclined to identify this fact as a real physical property .",
    "\\3 . for the most non - single - gaussian parts of the dataset we have established co - existence of two or more components , one",
    "of which ( often predominant ) has a mean value very close to zero , which does not contribute much to hsr .",
    "the other component has relatively large value , whose sign is sometimes in agreement ( for the data in the maximum and shortly after the maximum of the solar cycle ) , or disagreement ( for example of 1989 , just at the end of the rising phase of cycle 22 ) with the hsr .",
    "studies of the locations of the most non - single - gaussian parts over the time - latitude butterfly diagram shows that these agreement and disagreement are in accord with the global structure of helicity reported by zhang et al .",
    "( 2010 , cf .",
    "their fig.2 ) .",
    "we can interpret the result of multi - component distribution of helicity in terms of the dynamo model which addresses the origin of helicity in solar active regions .",
    "for example , there may be spatial and time domains where the dynamo mechanism does not work , or works differently .",
    "we may note here that the agreement or disagreement with hsr at some latitudes and times may be understood within the framework of solar dynamo models ( see , e.g. zhang et al . 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "discussion on the applicability of particular dynamo models is beyond the framework of this paper and will be addressed in our forthcoming studies .",
    "another possible interpretation is that the active regions which belong to multi - component distribution are intrinsically different and formed at different depth or by different mechanism .",
    "we may suggest that the formation of current helicity in solar active regions may in general occur due to various physical mechanisms at various scales .",
    "however , detailed investigation on these mechanisms are yet to be done .",
    "this challenges both the dynamo theory as well as the theory of flux tube / active region formation .",
