    "radio and x - ray observations of neutron stars provide strong evidence for the superfluidity of neutron star interiors .",
    "perhaps , the most striking manifestations of their superfluidity are the long ( on time - scales from several hours to hundreds of days ) relaxations that follow the glitches in the spin and spin - down rates of some pulsars .",
    "although the majority of pulsars are very precise clocks , timing observations reveal persistent random fluctuations in times of arrival of radio signals .",
    "some pulsars show long - term periodicities in their spin - characteristics and periodic changes of their pulse shape .",
    "however , the relation between the superfluidity of neutron star interiors and these anomalies of pulsar timing is not firmly established yet .",
    "further evidence for the superfluidity of neutron star interiors came in the 1980s with the advent of the orbiting x - ray satellites .",
    "the measurements of the thermal radiation from a dozen or so hot neutron stars provided indirect information on the temperature of superfluid phases in neutron stars .",
    "theoretical thermal histories of superfluid neutron stars are consistent with the x - ray data ( within the limits of our knowledge of the input physics ) .",
    "non - superfluid stars , as a rule , cool too fast to below the threshold of detection .",
    "apart from the radiation in the electro - magnetic spectrum , neutron stars are expected to be primary sources of gravitational wave radiation , which are expected to be detectable by future laser interferometer detectors .",
    "it is hoped that one can probe neutron star interiors and their superfluidity using gravity waves , as their eigen - frequencies and damping may depend on the dissipation in the superfluid , at temperatures below the superfluid phase transition .",
    "this review concentrates on the oscillations of superfluid self - gravitating ellipsoids within the tensor virial method .",
    "the method was originally introduced by chandrasekhar and fermi in the context of magneto - hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it was extensively developed in the 1960s by chandrasekhar for the study of the ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium and their oscillations .",
    "a comprehensive account of this work is contained in chandrasekhar s monograph _ ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium _",
    "( hereafter efe)@xcite .",
    "the ellipsoidal approximation provides an idealized picture of oscillations of neutron stars .",
    "one can think of several arguments in favor of adopting such an approach : first , the combination of the newtonian gravity and two - fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid defines an exactly solvable model if we assume that the fluids are incompressible and inviscid ; second , past experience with single - fluid self - gravitating ellipsoids shows that most of the qualitative features found for these ellipsoids have their analogs in more `` realistic '' systems ; third , the method is transparent and in many cases analytical results can be obtained which shed light on the underlying physics .",
    "the tensor virial method is not the only tool for investigating the properties of ellipsoidal figures .",
    "alternative formulations exist in the literature and we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for further details ; for a pedagogical introduction see the textbook @xcite .",
    "note , also , that various formulations of the theory of ellipsoids , to a large extent , are equivalent .",
    "superfluid oscillations were studied using various methods and approximations in the past decade .",
    "epstein pointed out that the superfluidity of neutron star interiors has potentially important effects on the propagation of seismically excited acoustic waves .",
    "it allows for additional types of waves to propagate by virtue of doubling of degrees of freedom in a superfluid ; superfluid phases create acoustic discontinuities in which wave velocities or polarizations change abruptly on the bounding interfaces @xcite .",
    "the effects of superfluidity on global hydrodynamic oscillations were investigated by lindblom and mendell @xcite in a model where the superfluid and the normal fluid are coupled via gravitational attraction and the _",
    "entrainment effect_. their solutions reveal that the lowest frequency pulsations are almost indistinguishable from those derived from the ordinary - fluid hydrodynamics ; however , their analytical solutions also reveal the existence of a spectrum of modes which are absent in a single fluid star .",
    "nonradial oscillations of non - rotating superfluid neutron stars were computed by lee , whose numerical solutions for the radial and non - radial pulsations of the two - fluid stars identified distinct superfluid modes @xcite .",
    "the effects of shear viscosity of the electron fluid and mutual friction on the r - mode oscillations were studied by lindblom and mendell @xcite by constructing an energy functional and computing the time - scales associated with the dissipative terms .",
    "the oscillation modes of superfluid analogs of the classical maclaurin , jacobi and roche ellipsoids were derived recently by sedrakian and wasserman @xcite within the tensor virial method .",
    "the oscillation modes of superfluid ellipsoids separate into two classes corresponding to relative and co - moving ( or center - of - mass , hereafter referred as cm ) motions of two fluids .",
    "the cm oscillations are identical to the oscillations of single - fluid ellipsoids and are undamped if one ignores the viscosity of the normal fluid .",
    "the mutual friction contributes only to the damping of the relative oscillation modes .",
    "one important feature of the latter modes is that they do not emit gravitational radiation as there is no mass transport associated with them .",

    "<S> this review starts with a discussion of the hierarchy of scales , relevant to the description of superfluids in neutron stars , which motivates a subsequent elementary exposition of the newtonian superfluid hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the euler equations for a superfluid and a normal fluid we apply the tensor virial method to obtain the virial equations of the first , second , and third order and to compute their eulerian perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> special emphasis is put on the computation of perturbations of the new terms due to mutual gravitational attraction and mutual friction between the two fluids . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation modes of superfluid maclaurin spheroids are derived from the first and second order perturbed virial equations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two generic classes of oscillation modes which correspond to the _ co - moving _ and _ relative oscillations _ of two fluids . </S>",
    "<S> these modes decouple if the normal fluid is inviscid . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the mixing of these modes ( when the normal fluid is viscous ) and its effect on the dynamical and secular instabilities of the co - moving modes and their damping . </S>"
