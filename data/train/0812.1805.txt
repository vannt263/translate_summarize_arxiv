    "take an elastic rod or strip that is coiled when left free and pull the ends apart without fixing their orientation .",
    "we can do this by attaching strings to the ends and applying a tensile force to the strings ( see fig .",
    "[ photos ] ) .",
    "if we imagine the rod to be held between two parallel glass plates , forcing it to adopt an essentially planar configuration , then we would observe the formation of a number of loops given by the number of initial coils .",
    "the loops have nowhere to go under increased stretching of the rod and grow into tight hockles with a highly localised curvature . without the constraining walls the planar configuration becomes unstable at a certain force and unlooping occurs .",
    "however , this unlooping force can be very high , especially if the rod has a flat cross - section , and the structure may get damaged ( e.g. , through plastic deformation ) before loop pop - out occurs .",
    "indeed , hockles ( or kinks or snarls ) are a serious concern not only in the use of garden hoses but also in such slender industrial structures as marine pipelines , mooring ropes , textile yarns and communication cables @xcite . pipes , ropes , yarns and cables often acquire intrinsic curvature due to creep from storage on a drum , putting them at risk for the above hockling scenario .",
    "+                helical springs have also recently been fabricated at the micro and nano scale @xcite , where they hold great promise as essential parts of future micro- or nano(electro)mechanical devices such as chemical or biological sensors , cantilevers , resonators , inductors , actuators , etc .",
    "nanohelices have been synthesised from different materials leading to structures with unusual mechanical properties , and force - extension experiments on nanosprings , nanocoils and nanobelts are actively being performed @xcite .",
    "for instance , zno and si@xmath0n@xmath1 springs have been shown to be superelastic , i.e. , they can be stretched to an almost straight line and when released they restore their shape without damage @xcite .",
    "an interesting development is the fabrication of nanosprings with very small pitch @xcite .",
    "such springs are particularly desirable because they allow for a large magnetic flux density .",
    "in this paper we consider the problem of successive hockling and unlooping of a helically coiled strip of low pitch under tensile load .",
    "this problem was briefly touched upon in @xcite , where we modelled the strip as an inextensible helical shell motivated by multistability observed in cholesterol ribbons @xcite .",
    "here we do not make the inextensibility assumption and model the strip in the more common way as a transversely anisotropic rod @xcite .",
    "the undeformed rod is curved about the axis of least bending stiffness ( so that our spring is close to a clock spring , rather than , say , a slinky toy ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : spring ] ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that although the rod will be assumed to have an inextensbile centreline , this rod model is not equivalent to the inextensible strip model in the limit of infinitesimal width , as shown by @xcite .",
    "the two models apply to different circumstances .     schematic diagram of a pulled spring of helical angle @xmath2 .",
    "a flat strip is drawn to emphasise the anisotropic bending stiffness of the rod.,width=288 ]    we choose zero - moment boundary conditions because these seem to be a reasonable choice to avoid kinking as the rod is free to unwind ( the loops are not ` locked in ' as in the case of clamped boundary conditions ) .",
    "nevertheless , we show that under certain conditions on the elastic and geometrical parameters a tightly coiled strip when pulled behaves in a highly nonlinear way . under small forces the spring s force - extension behaviour is hookean , but at larger extensions the loading curve develops hysteresis cycles as more and more loops pop out .",
    "these pop - outs form brief and abrupt three - dimensional excursions in a process that is otherwise remarkably well approximated by planar elastic behaviour .",
    "this planar behaviour is described by the euler elastica subject to a constant intrinsic curvature .",
    "the fact that a low - pitch helical spring is found to jump between planar states justifies a revisit of the euler elastica and we give what appears to be a new classification of its solutions subject to zero - moment end conditions .",
    "the corresponding force - extension curves provide the scaffold of the tensile response of the helical spring . at larger",
    "pitch no tight hockles occur , although multistability may be observed @xcite .",
    "multi - loop hockling and unlooping does not seem to have been studied before .",
    "@xcite only considered a single loop .",
    "@xcite discussed cable loop stability assuming a single tightly coiled helical turn .",
    "both works assume the unstressed rod to be straight and avoid boundary conditions by assuming the cable to be infinitely long .",
    "we model the strip as a finite - length intrinsically curved elastic rod of anisotropic ( flat ) cross - section .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we set up the equilibrium equations for elastic rod statics . in section 3",
    "we classify the planar solutions of this strip and find the force - extension curves which the curves for a coiled strip will be compared against ( in section 4 ) .",
    "the main result of the paper is fig .",
    "[ spring ] , which shows the hysteretic force - extension behaviour characterising multi - loop pop - out .",
    "we briefly contrast this behaviour with that of springs of different geometric and elastic parameters .",

    "our study has been restricted to ( quasi-)statical solutions . in practice",
    "the three - dimensional excursions will be rapid and would require dynamical modelling , as for instance in @xcite .",
    "our work also paid no attention to self - contacts .",
    "this is justified by the fact that no shapes we computed cross themselves ( the only exception is the slinky shape at very small force ) . thus choosing cross - sections small enough excludes self - contact .    by choosing our torsional stiffness to satisfy the nikolai condition as an equality we take the maximum possible value for any solid cross - section , given the bending stiffnesses @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the poisson ratio @xmath168 .",
    "even so , we need quite a small value of @xmath168 to observe the unlooping cascade described in the previous sections .",
    "however , moving away from solid cross - sections , materials ( e.g. , biopolymers ) are now well - known that have a relatively large torsional stiffness corresponding to a small or even negative effective poisson ratio .",
    "for instance , double - stranded dna is exceptionally stiff in torsion @xcite .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the inextensible helical shell model considered by @xcite would exhibit the unlooping cascade for a larger range of @xmath168 values because of its higher intrinsic torsional stiffness .",
    "our results may be useful for the design of mechanisms for the deployment of ribbon - like structures .",
    "the nonlinear properties of the elastic response of helical strips could be exploited in mechanical sensors and actuators at the micro- or nanoscale , where low - pitch springs are being considered .",
    "helical curves are characterised by constant curvature and torsion . since the stiffness ratio @xmath37 is generally taken relatively large in this paper ( @xmath148 in figs .",
    "[ spring ] and [ helix ] ) bending of the rod will predominantly be about @xmath172 , the direction of intrinsic curvature .",
    "thus we seek helical solutions of the equations in section 2 with @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 it is convenient to introduce the helical angle @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : spring ] ) such that @xmath176 .",
    "force and extension for a unit - length helix are then parametrised in terms of @xmath2 as follows : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the radius of the undeformed helix and @xmath61 is a coordinate along its axis .",
    "note that the force is now pointing along the axis of the helix and not necessarily along the end - to - end vector .",
    "the radius of the deformed helix is given by @xmath179"
