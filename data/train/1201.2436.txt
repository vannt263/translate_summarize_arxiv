    "in many open quantum systems , the coupling between the system and the bath can be considered as a small parameter . in this case",
    "the application of second order perturbation leads to a master equation of redfield or lindblad type  @xcite .",
    "their numerical implementation is straightforward and not computationally expensive .",
    "however , for many physical systems of current interest it has been shown that the weak coupling approximation is not justified .",
    "one example is the energy transfer process in photosynthetic complexes where the magnitude of the system - bath coupling is comparable to the electronic couplings  @xcite .",
    "there are only a few non - perturbative techniques to obtain the numerically exact dynamics ; examples include the hierarchy master equation  @xcite , the quasi - adiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi )  @xcite , and the multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( mctdh )  @xcite approach .",
    "however , these methods are computationally demanding and also not trivial to implement .",
    "recently , a polaron transformed second order master equation  @xcite and its variational form  @xcite have been derived to study the dynamics of open quantum systems at strong coupling .",
    "this approach transforms the total hamiltonian into the polaron frame such that the system hamiltonian is dressed by a polaron . the master equation",
    "is then obtained by applying perturbation theory to the transformed system - bath interaction term .",
    "this approach extends the regime of validity of the master equation to stronger system - bath coupling , provided that the electronic couplings ( or tunneling matrix elements ) are small compared to the typical bath frequency .",
    "when this condition is not fulfilled the polaron is too sluggish to accurately follow the system motion and the polaron transformation may perform worse than the standard master equation approach .    in order to partially overcome this difficulty ,",
    "the variational method has been developed as a generalization of the polaron transformation  @xcite .",
    "instead of performing the full transformation , the variational polaron approach seeks for an optimal amount of transformation , depending on the properties of the bath .",
    "thus it is able to interpolate between the strong and weak coupling regimes and to capture the correct behavior over a much broader range of parameters .",
    "both the polaron and variational master equations have the attractive feature of being computationally economic ( they have the same computational complexity as the redfield equation ) and are therefore suitable for studying large systems .    however , a thorough assessment of the accuracy of second order perturbation theory in the polaron and variational polaron frames is still lacking .",
    "it is not exactly clear how the accuracy depends on the properties of the bath , namely the bath relaxation time and the coupling strength .",
    "one of the main goals of this work is to provide such a benchmark . instead of studying the dynamics ,",
    "here we focus on the equilibrium density matrix .",
    "focusing on this quantity offers two key advantages .",
    "firstly , in the equilibrium case the second order perturbation is the only approximation involved . in the derivation of second order master equations , additional approximations generally must be invoked , such as factorized initial conditions , the born - markov approximation , the rotating wave approximation , etc .",
    "these additional restrictions prevent a clear assessment of the isolated role of second order perturbation theory and the merits of the polaron transformation . thus studying the equilibrium density matrix offers a direct comparison of the various perturbation methods .",
    "a second advantage of studying the equilibrium state is that it is much easier to obtain numerically exact results .",
    "therefore we are able to systematically explore a large range of the parameter space that is often not possible with other exact treatments of the dynamics .    in the next section ,",
    "the details of the spin - boson model used in the remainder of the text are outlined . following this ,",
    "the polaron transformation and its variational extension are applied to the hamiltonian in sec .",
    "[ sec : transformations ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pt ] , the second - order corrections to the equilibrium reduced density matrix are derived in the original , polaron and variational polaron frames . in the ensuing section ,",
    "results for the various perturbation theories are compared with exact numerical results from path integral calculations over a broad range of the parameter space .",
    "it is found that the second order results in the original frame are accurate for small system - bath coupling , the full polaron results are accurate in the opposite regime of strong coupling , and the variational method is capable of interpolating between these two extremes .",
    "all three approaches become less accurate for slow baths .",
    "the spin - boson model is a paradigm for the study of quantum dissipative systems .",
    "it has been used to investigate the energy transfer in light harvesting systems  @xcite , the problem of decoherence in quantum optics  @xcite , tunneling phenomena in condensed media  @xcite , and quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the spin - boson model consists of a two - level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",

    "the bath is modeled as a set of harmonic oscillators labeled by their frequencies , @xmath6 , and couplings to the two - level system denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the properties of the harmonic bath are completely determined by the spectral density , @xmath8 . throughout the paper",
