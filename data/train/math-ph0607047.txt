    "[ sec : mainstory ]    so little is understood about hydrodynamic turbulence that there is not even consensus on what it is . however , most physicists would agree on the following heuristic picture which has emerged from the works kolmogorov , onsager , richardson , etc  @xcite . in this picture , ( fully developed )",
    "turbulence refers to the idealized state of an incompressible fluid described by the navier - stokes equations in the limit of vanishing molecular viscosity . in this limit",
    ", the navier - stokes equations formally reduces to the euler equations , and the turbulent solutions should be the most regular solutions of the euler equations which dissipate energy .",
    "this is referred to as anomalous dissipation and is best visualized in the fourier representation .",
    "there it corresponds to a cascade of energy from the small wavenumbers ( large spatial scales ) where energy is injected ( either via the initial condition or by a forcing term in the equation ) towards larger and larger wavenumbers ( smaller and smaller scales ) , up to infinity where energy should eventually be dissipated .",
    "it is also believed that the cascade of energy implies that the energy spectrum of the turbulent solutions have a power law decay in the wavenumber whose rate can be deduced by dimensional analysis and is @xmath12 in three - dimension of space .    turbulence theory ( as we shall refer to the heuristic picture above ) also discusses more advanced and more controversial topics such as intermittency .",
    "but , without even going into those , most mathematicians would agree that a rigorous confirmation of the basic predictions of turbulence theory is already a tremendous challenge .",
    "the best known results on the navier - stokes and euler equations which corroborate the above were obtained in  @xcite .",
    "these works only indicate that turbulence theory is not blatantly inconsistent .",
    "simpler models , such as randomly forced burgers equation or kraichnan s model of passive scalar advection ( see e.g. @xcite for reviews ) , have also been used to demonstrate that parts of turbulence theory make sense in terms of anomalous dissipation of the weak solutions of the inviscid burgers equation and the spectrum of energy of the solutions that this implies .",
    "even these simple models remain surprisingly complicated to analyze and a full characterization of the statistical properties of their solutions is still lacking .",
    "one of the purposes of the present paper is to illustrate turbulence theory on even simpler models .",
    "many ( if not most ) of the realistic features have been neglected in our models .",
    "yet , the models possess a rich range of behaviors which depend on the details of the interactions .",
    "they provide a simple class of exactly solvable models which can be useful in understanding the inner workings of some energy transfer mechanisms .",
    "the solutions of these models are also consistent with much of the claims of turbulence theory . in a way ,",
    "they offer a setting for the skeptical mathematician to understand the motivation behind these claims , and if this paper succeed in doing this , we will have achieved our main goal .    next , we introduce the models that we will investigate and we summarize the principal results of the paper",
    ". as we will see , the most interesting and meaningful solutions of these models are solutions which have blown - up , such that they have become infinite in some norm .",
    "this justifies our claim that `` life starts after blow - up '' : disregarding these solutions as nonsensical , as one may be tempted to do at first sight , would , in fact , completely miss the most interesting phenomena displayed by the models .",
    "consider the equation @xmath13\\ ] ] for @xmath14 with the boundary condition @xmath15 for all @xmath16 . if @xmath17 , we can rescale time to fix @xmath18 ; observe also that if @xmath19 satisfies the equations with the parameter @xmath20 then @xmath21 satisfies the equations with parameter @xmath22 .    in light of these considerations ,",
    "we set @xmath18 and focus our attention on @xmath23 for @xmath24 with the boundary condition @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "although we will see that this calculation is not always correct , on the formal level one has that @xmath25\\\\      & = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n a_{n}(t)a_{n+1}(t ) - \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n      a_n(t)a_{n+1}(t)=0 \\ ; .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second equality is only formal as it assumes that the sum @xmath26 is finite and absolutely convergent . to understand this",
    "further , consider the evolution of the partial sum @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 , @xmath29 the validity of   necessitates @xmath30 if this condition is not satisfied , then the formal manipulation in  ( [ eq : nodiss ] ) does _ not _ hold and the seemingly conservative coupling term in  ( [ eq : b ] ) may become a source of anomalous dissipation .",
    "we make the concept of anomalous dissipation precise in section  [ sec : anomalousdiss ] .",
    "but , roughly speaking , it is when seemingly conservative terms have a dissipative effect on the system .    in the context of equation",
    ", anomalous dissipation seems to require that the limit as @xmath31 of the right hand side of be negative . in other words , equation is dissipative at time @xmath16 if @xmath32 if we make the reasonable assumption that @xmath33 , then from  ( [ eq : dissipativedef ] ) the solution of equation will be dissipative with a finite dissipation rate provided that @xmath34 at this point some readers may be skeptical since one typically considers equations like with initial data in @xmath35 , the space of square - summable sequences .",
    "however , we will see ( theorem [ thm : simpleexistence ] in section [ sec : examplesfirst ] ) that equation has solutions which exist for all time provided @xmath36 this condition admits a large class of initial conditions including those which scale as . in section [ sec : examplesfirst ] , we will also see that possesses a wide verity of behavior including conservative , dissipative , and explosive solutions .",
    "it might be tempting to dismiss these non - conservative solutions as non - physical solution arising from pathological data .",
    "we now discuss why is not the case .",
    "consider equation with a white - noise forcing in the first coordinate : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is @xmath39 if @xmath40 and @xmath41 otherwise , and @xmath42 denotes a standard brownian motion , i.e. gaussian process with mean zero and covariance @xmath43 . if one were to accept the formal calculations in , showing energy conservation , then @xmath44 if the energy is initially finite .",
    "hence , in the forced system energy seems to grow linearly with time and at @xmath45 one expects the system to have infinite energy .",
    "these solutions which `` blow - up '' ( in the sense that they have infinite energy ) are the most interesting and relevant . in light of the discussion above",
    ", one might expect that the energy of the system would grow to be infinite and arrange the @xmath19 so that the calculation in is not valid since the sum is not rearrangeable .",
    "onsager would then predict that the system would evolve to the state in which the @xmath19 decayed as fast as possible but sill dissipated energy in the sense that holds .",
    "the reasoning which leads to strongly suggests that the @xmath46 should scale as @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , if the system is to reach some equilibrium the effect of the dissipation must exactly balance that of the forcing . specifically , in the stochastic setting when the forcing is @xmath48 , @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "all of these conclusion turn out to be correct .",
    "in particular , in section [ sec : bforced ] we prove that if @xmath51 then the solutions converge to a unique random variable @xmath52 which is gaussian with mean zero and whose distribution is the unique stationary measure for the system .",
    "furthermore , this equilibrium state has a structure which is consistent with the anticipated @xmath47 scaling : @xmath53 we also show that similar behaviors are observed with a different type of forcing .",
    "in particular , if the forcing is constant , @xmath54 then the system evolves to a unique steady state @xmath55 which scales as @xmath56 in summary , we see that the forced systems energy grows linearly with time if the energy is initially finite .",
    "asymptotically , the system rearranges itself so that it reaches a state which dissipates energy at @xmath45 .",
    "this state is chosen so that the dissipation rate matches the energy flux into the system from the forcing .",
    "since the energy flux is finite , this leaves @xmath57 as the only choice .",
    "a slower decay rate would produce an infinite rate of dissipation and a faster decay rate would produce a system which conserved energy since the limit in would be zero .",
    "we introduce a second model which also exhibits interesting but different `` blow - up '' behavior .",
    "consider @xmath58 for @xmath24 with the boundary condition @xmath59 for all @xmath16 .",
    "as in the previous subsection , the unforced equation _ formally _ conserves energy since @xmath60=0.\\ ] ] this equality ( as in the case of equation  ) is only formal since , in general , the sum can not be rearranged .",
    "as before , to gain insight we consider the partial sums . for @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath61 with this in mind , ( [ eq : c ] ) will be called conservative if @xmath62 and dissipative if @xmath63 unlike the case of equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) , if one assumes that @xmath64 exists and is in @xmath65 , then the solution of equation ( [ eq : c ] ) will be dissipative if @xmath66 as @xmath9 .",
    "a solution satisfying @xmath67 ( if one exists ) has finite energy : @xmath68 .",
    "thus , this model differs from the first example in that the system can dissipate energy even when the total energy is finite .",
    "while we do not prove a general existence result as broad as for , we do show ( in theorem [ th : c ] ) that the dynamics for are well defined if @xmath69 this is sufficient for our needs : in particular , it covers the case when @xmath66 as @xmath9 .",
    "the differences between the first and second models are greater than simply the scaling .",
    "when started with initial conditions having finite energy the first model conserves energy .",
    "in fact the regularity at time  @xmath16 is the same as the regularity of the initial condition .",
    "in contrast , if we start with initial data satisfying ( and hence with finite energy ) , the energy decays with time .",
    "furthermore , for almost every @xmath70 one has that @xmath71 as @xmath72 and there exists @xmath73 , depending on the initial data , so that if @xmath74 then @xmath75 and @xmath76 and @xmath50 . turning to the forced setting ,",
    "consider @xmath77 when @xmath78 then @xmath79 if @xmath80 , we have @xmath81      in practice , one is often interested in understanding the limit of equations when the explicit sources of dissipation are removed . to explore this question",
    "we investigate equation with the addition of an overtly dissipative term and then study the limit as the dissipation is removed .",
    "to understand our motivation , recall that we have seen that if the first model is started with finite energy initial data then the formal calculation presented in is valid for all finite times as the energy must be infinity for to fail . yet , as time tends to infinity , the forced system converges to a steady state with infinite energy for which the calculation presented in fails .",
    "in contrast , in the second model the analogous calculation , given in , fails at almost every positive time since @xmath82 as @xmath72 for almost every @xmath83 .    since the coupling term produces dissipation at finite times in the second model , it is most interesting to study the effect of extra , explicit dissipation in the first model . to this end , we consider the stochastically forced version of the first model with extra , explicit dissipation sufficient to keep expected energy of the system finite for all times . in particular , the calculation in is valid in the equilibrium state .",
    "we are interested in the structure of this invariant state and how it converges to the steady state without the explicit dissipation ( as the dissipation is removed ) .",
    "we will consider two cases , one for which the dissipative term is lower order than the coupling term and one for which it is higher order . specifically , for @xmath84 and any @xmath85 , consider the equation @xmath86",
    "+ { \\mathbf{1}}_{n=1 } \\dot w(t).\\ ] ]    the case @xmath87 corresponds to the lower order damping and is analogous to what is called eckman damping in the context of fluid mechanics . when @xmath88 the perturbation is higher order than the coupling term and behaves as a viscous term in the language of fluid mechanics . as in the previous examples , we force the first coordinate with white noise . assuming that @xmath89 , it is straight forward to see that @xmath90 stays finite and uniformly bounded in time for any @xmath91 .",
    "hence , the system remains conservative for all time .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath50 the system converges to a random variable @xmath92 whose distribution is the unique stationary measure for the system .",
    "direct calculation in the spirit of shows that    @xmath93    thus , there is no anomalous dissipation in the system : all of the dissipation which balances the forcing comes from the term @xmath94 . in section [ sec : invlim ] , we will see that for @xmath84 ,    @xmath95 ^ 2 \\to0 \\quad\\text{as}\\quad \\nu\\to0.\\ ] ]    both of these steady states are gaussian with mean zero .",
    "the way in which the variance of @xmath96 converges ( as @xmath97 ) to that of the @xmath98 steady state @xmath99 is different for the two values of @xmath100 we consider .",
    "when @xmath87 one has    @xmath101 ^ 2=   2^{1 - 2\\nu }     \\gamma(1 + 2\\nu ) \\frac{\\gamma(2n+1 - 2\\nu)}{\\gamma(2n + 2 ) }      \\eqsim\\frac{1}{n^{1 + 2\\nu}}\\;.\\ ] ]    this shows that variances still decay like a power of @xmath6 .",
    "notice that for all @xmath85 the total energy is finite .",
