    "we do not detect evidence for a hubble - flow in the [ fe  ii ] emission from the jet .",
    "if environmental interaction is dominated by the first impulse from the jet , portions of the jet traced by [ fe  ii ] that travel in the wake of the initial bow shock will transfer little momentum to the environment .    some optical emission from the jet body in the outer portions of hh  666",
    "o , near the leading bow shock ( feature o3 in figure  [ fig : pm ] , also see figure  [ fig : hst_ims ] ) further supports the idea that there are two externally irradiated outflow components visible in hh  666 .",
    "h@xmath0 , [ s  ii ] , and [ fe  ii ] emission begin to coincide just beyond the edge of the dust pillar , marking the first place where the newly liberated _ jet _ is laid bare to ionizing radiation .",
    "optical emission from the _ jet _ beyond the pillar edge suggests a decrease in the intervening optical depth , and the increase of the [ fe  ii ] ratio @xmath11 toward the terminus of hh  666  o supports this interpretation .",

    "the blueshifted part of the outflow , hh  666  m , that extends to the northwest of the protostar reveals a similar picture to hh  666  o. close to the driving source ( within @xmath12 ) , the behavior of the h@xmath0 and [ fe  ii ] emission in hh  666  m resembles that of hh  666  o. a narrow column of knotty [ fe  ii ] emission bisects broad , arc - like h@xmath0 emission before the morphologies traced by the two lines converge at larger distances from the protostar .",

    "a hubble - like velocity pattern in hh  666  m further suggests that the dark patch to the northwest of the driving source is an evacuated cavity in the dust pillar cleared by the jet .",
    "if this is correct , hh  666  o should create a corresponding cavity to the southeast of the driving source as it propagates deeper into the cloud . to test this , we took an intensity tracing through the pillar along the axis of the jet to search for a decrease in the ambient h@xmath0 emission on either side of the driving source ( see figure  [ fig : cavity_tracings ] ) . indeed , intensity tracings reveal dips in the h@xmath0 intensity along the pillar extending @xmath14  on either side of the driving source .",

    ", we expect larger proper motions from the jet itself ( @xmath18 mas yr@xmath3 for a velocity of 200 km s@xmath3 ) , although additional [ fe  ii ] imaging at a later epoch is required to test this hypothesis .",
    "our data show that h@xmath0 emission traces entrained outflowing gas with the same hubble - like velocity structure seen in molecular outflows associated with other hh jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "no h@xmath19 emission that is unambiguously associated with the jet has been observed in hh  666 @xcite , although weak h@xmath19 emission will be difficult to discern against the bright background of the photodissociation region ( pdr ) .",

    "proper motions reveal the dynamical age of these h@xmath0 outflow lobes to be @xmath20 yrs ( see table  2 ) .",
    "this points to a sudden increase in the jet mass - loss rate @xmath4 yrs ago that provided a `` kick '' to the ambient material now seen as a hubble flow in h@xmath0 emission .",
    "several more distant knots in hh  666 indicate that the jet had other outbursts like this in the past @xcite .",
    "steady [ fe  ii ] emission inside the h@xmath0 cocoons on either side of the jet indicates that the high - mass - loss rate episode has persisted , with a duration comparable to its age .",
    "a burst duration of @xmath4 yrs is an order of magnitude larger than the estimated decay time of fu  orionis outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while the burst duration is long compared to those inferred for low - mass protostars , the @xmath4 yr dynamical time of the inner jet is only a small fraction of the overall age of the hh  666 outflow ( @xmath21 yr , see * ? ? ?",
    "this points to a strong , sustained increase in the accretion rate from a relatively evolved intermediate - mass protostar . a larger sample of intermediate - mass protostars is required to determine the frequency and duty cycle of such accretion bursts , and whether they remain stronger than their low - mass counterparts throughout their evolution .",
    "[ fe  ii ] emission from hh  666 traces a steady jet with higher densities and velocities than traced by h@xmath0 emission .",

    "( see table  2 ) , implies that the three - dimensional velocity of the [ fe  ii ] jet is @xmath24 km s@xmath3 , almost twice the speed of the h@xmath0 jet . the higher mass - loss rate and velocities in the [ fe  ii ] jet suggest that this component of the outflow has at least an order of magnitude more momentum .",
    "however , the steady velocity of the [ fe  ii ] jet traveling in the wake of the initial bow shock suggests little momentum transfer to the local environment .",
    "this means that the high momentum of the [ fe  ii ] jet will not be deposited locally in the molecular globule , but rather injected into the h  ii region where its contribution to driving turbulence in the region will be dwarfed by feedback from massive stars .",

    "we propose that the same underlying physics that drives the molecular outflows seen from more embedded intermediate - mass protostars creates the two - component outflow we observe in hh  666 . unlike jets with molecular outflows ,",
    "hh  666 resides in a giant h  ii region , so both the jet and the material it entrains are subject to the harsh uv background created by the many o - type stars in the carina nebula .",

    "<S> hh  666 is an externally irradiated protostellar outflow in the carina nebula for which we present new near - ir [ fe  ii ] spectra obtained with the fire spectrograph at magellan observatory . </S>",
    "<S> earlier h@xmath0 and near - ir [ fe  ii ] imaging revealed that the two emission lines trace substantially different morphologies in the inner @xmath1  of the outflow . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath0 traces a broad cocoon that surrounds the collimated [ fe  ii ] jet that extends throughout the parent dust pillar . </S>",
    "<S> new spectra show that this discrepancy extends to their kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> near - ir [ fe  ii ] emission traces steady , fast velocities of @xmath2 km s@xmath3 from the eastern and western limbs of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this to a previously published h@xmath0 spectrum that reveals a hubble - flow velocity structure near the jet - driving source . </S>",

    "<S> h@xmath0 images reveal the _ lateral _ spreading of the h@xmath0 outflow lobe away from the jet axis . </S>",
    "<S> proper motions also indicate a sudden increase in the mass - loss rate @xmath4 yr ago , while steady [ fe  ii ] emission throughout the inner jet suggest that the burst is ongoing . </S>",
    "<S> an accretion burst sustained for @xmath4 yr is an order of magnitude longer than expected for fu  orionis outbursts , but represents only a small fraction of the total age of the hh  666 outflow . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , available data suggests that [ fe  ii ] traces the highly collimated protostellar _ jet _ while h@xmath0 traces the entrained and irradiated _ </S>",
    "<S> outflow_. hh  666 appears to be a missing link between bare jets seen in h  ii regions and entrained molecular outflows seen from embedded protostars in more quiescent regions .    </S>",
