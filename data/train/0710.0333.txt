    "in the standard model ( sm ) the higgs mass parameter receives quadratically divergent radiative corrections from high scales , leading to a hierarchy problem .",
    "this suggests the existence of new physics at or close to a tev that cancels these radiative corrections , thereby stabilizing the weak scale .",
    "one interesting possibility , first explored in  @xcite , is that the higgs mass parameter is protected against radiative corrections because the higgs is the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) of an approximate global symmetry .",
    "this idea has recently experienced a revival in the form of little higgs theories  , and also twin higgs theories  @xcite .",
    "these theories stabilize the weak scale against radiative corrections up to scales of order 10 tev .",
    "it is important to find ultra - violet ( uv ) completions of these theories that extend their validity to scales beyond 10 tev .",
    "non - supersymmetric weakly coupled uv completions of the simplest little higgs  @xcite and simple group little higgs  @xcite have been found .",
    "supersymmetric uv completions of the little higgs  @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) , have also been constructed , in the context of the supersymmetric little hierarchy problem . there has also been work on the difficult problem of finding uv completions of these theories where the pattern of symmetry breaking is realized through strong dynamics  . in this case",
    "the problem is complicated by the requirement that the new strong dynamics preserve a custodial su(2 ) symmetry , so as not to generate large corrections to precision electroweak observables .",
    "an alternative approach has been to construct holographic little higgs models in five dimensions  @xcite , which are related to strongly coupled theories in four dimensions through the ads / cft correspondence .    in this paper",
    "we show that the characteristic symmetry breaking patterns of two well - motivated little higgs theories can be realized through the condensation of strongly coupled fermions .",
    "we begin by dynamically realizing the symmetry breaking pattern of the simplest little higgs model .",
    "our construction does not require any additional light states beyond those of the original model , and a custodial su(2 ) symmetry of the new strong dynamics limits the size of corrections to precision electroweak observables .",
    "we then go on to consider the moose model of chang and wacker @xcite , which is the smallest extension of the minimal moose @xcite which incorporates an approximate custodial su(2 ) symmetry , and show that this symmetry breaking pattern can also be realized through strong dynamics . in the case of this ` next - to - minimal moose ' ( nmm ) model , our construction predicts the existence of an additional scalar field with mass of order a tev that has exactly the same quantum numbers as the standard model higgs , and which decays primarily to third generation quarks .",
    "consider first the simplest little higgs , which has the symmetry breaking pattern [  @xmath0 ] @xmath1 .",
    "the vector  subgroup , which is gauged , is broken down to the sm gauge group , and 5 of the 10 nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngbs ) are eaten .",
    "the remaining 5 are actually pngbs , and they constitute the higgs of the sm and an additional sm singlet .",
    "the interactions of the pngbs are governed by universal low - energy theorems which are independent of any specific uv completion .",
    "this allows us to write down an effective field theory for the pngbs valid at low energies , which takes the form of a non - linear sigma model .",
    "we parameterize the pngb degrees of freedom as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we write @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the two independent breaking scales for each   global symmetry .",
    "the 5 matrices @xmath7 span [ / ] : @xmath8 in general the low energy effective lagrangian for the fields @xmath9 will contain all operators involving @xmath10 and @xmath11 consistent with the non - linearly realized  symmetry , suppressed by the cutoff of the non - linear sigma model , which we denote by @xmath12 .",
    "the scale @xmath12 is constrained to be less than or of order @xmath13 , where the upper bound is at strong coupling .",
    "the coefficients of these operators are determined by the uv physics .",
    "one of the operators allowed by symmetry takes the form @xmath14 where the value of the coefficient @xmath15 depends on the specific uv completion .",
    "this operator violates the approximate custodial su(2 ) symmetry of the standard model .",
    "its effect is to alter the ratio of the masses of the w and z gauge bosons from the standard model prediction , and it is therefore very tightly constrained by experiment .",
    "a potential problem with any uv completion where this pattern of symmetry breaking is realized through strong dynamics is that @xmath15 is expected to be of order @xmath16 , constraining the cutoff @xmath12 to be of order 50 tev or higher .",
    "since little higgs theories can only stabilize the weak scale up to energies of order 10 tev or so , this reintroduces fine - tuning .",
    "is there a way that this operator can be suppressed ?",
    "a linear realization of this symmetry breaking pattern is instructive : consider two scalar fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 which transform as a @xmath19 under the  gauge symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath20 after symmetry breaking one linear combination of the ngbs from @xmath17 and @xmath18 is eaten , while the orthogonal linear combination which contains the sm higgs survives .",
    "we denote the vev of @xmath17 by @xmath5 and that of @xmath18 by @xmath6 .",
    "the pngb fields of the non - linear model are those degrees of freedom which survive after integrating out the radial modes of the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the linear model .",
    "the key observation is that in the limit that the gauge symmetry is turned off this potential , eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) , has an accidental so(6@xmath21 global symmetry which is broken to so(5@xmath21 , and the 10 ngbs can just as well be thought of as arising from this symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "once we gauge the vector  subgroup of the global symmetry again , 5 of these ngbs are eaten , while the remaining 5 survive in the low energy theory as pngbs .",
    "consider now the situation where the breaking pattern so(6@xmath21 to so(5@xmath21 is realized non - linearly .",
    "since the symmetry breaking pattern now preserves the custodial su(2 ) of the sm , operators such as eq .",
    "( [ problem ] ) are forbidden to leading order .",
    "they are only generated through loops involving those interactions ( gauge and yukawa couplings ) that violate the custodial su(2 ) symmetry , and therefore the coefficient @xmath15 is at most of order one .",
    "this allows the scale @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ problem ] ) to be as low as 5 tev without conflicting with the constraints from precision electroweak measurements .",
    "we see from this that the first step to finding a strongly coupled uv completion of the simplest little higgs is to find a way to break so(6@xmath21 to so(5@xmath21 through strong dynamics .",
    "we now explain how this can be accomplished .",
    "notice that su(4 ) is the double - cover of so(6 ) , and sp(4 ) is the double - cover of so(5 ) ; in both cases the lie algebras are isomorphic .",
    "the problem is therefore to break su(4@xmath21 to sp(4@xmath21 through strong dynamics .",
    "consider an su(2 ) gauge theory with 4 fields @xmath22 in the fundamental representation . here",
    "@xmath23 is an su(2 ) gauge index and @xmath24 takes values 1 through 4 .",
    "when the su(2 ) gauge theory gets strong we expect a condensate @xmath25 to form along the gauge singlet direction .",
    "this is antisymmetric in the indices @xmath24 and @xmath26 , thereby breaking the su(4 ) global symmetry down to sp(4 ) . in order to break su(4@xmath21 to sp(4@xmath21",
    "we merely begin with two copies of the su(2 ) gauge theory  each with 4 fields in the fundamental representation .",
    "we label the two copies of the @xmath27 s as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the corresponding condensates @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "symmetry has gauged subgroup .",
    "the curly braces indicate that only the diagonal subgroup of su(4@xmath21 is gauged .",
    "the black filled - in circle is a condensing su(2 ) group .",
    "each link field is a collection of four su(2 ) fundamentals that transforms like a fundamental ( anti - fundamental ) of su(4 ) . ]",
    "we are free to weakly gauge a vector  subgroup of the su(4@xmath21 global symmetry , as shown in figure [ fig : su3 ] . without loss of generality",
    "we may take the indices @xmath32 to be su(3 ) gauge indices , while @xmath33 is not an su(3 ) gauge index .",
    "the su(3 ) gauge symmetry is anomaly free provided the fields in @xmath27 transform in the fundamental representation and the fields in @xmath34 in the anti - fundamental .",
    "we choose the charges of the u(1 ) such that the fields in @xmath27 transforming as the fundamental of su(3 ) have charge + 1/6 , while the su(3 ) singlet has charge -1/2 .",
    "the anti - fundamental of su(3 ) in @xmath34 has u(1 ) charge -1/6 and the su(3 ) singlet charge + 1/2 .",
    "after condensation this  gauge symmetry is broken to the  of the sm .",
    "the low energy effective theory can once again be described by a non - linear sigma model .",

    "define @xmath38 here the 5 matrices @xmath39 are the generators of su(4)/sp(4 ) . @xmath40",
    "the matrix @xmath41 has exactly the same form as the matrix @xmath30 , and we parameterize the corresponding low energy degrees of freedom by @xmath42 , collected in a matrix @xmath43 .    by choosing to keep only the  subgroup of each su(4 ) symmetry manifest , we can immediately carry over all results of the original simplest little higgs model to this new construction . to see this explicitly ,",
    "consider the decomposition of su(4 ) into its  subgroup .",
    "we can identify the @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s with the @xmath46 s and @xmath47 s up to constants of proportionality , since they have exactly the same transformation properties under the nonlinearly realized : @xmath48 in the absence of any explicit symmetry breaking , the low energy effective lagrangian for the pngbs consists of all operators involving @xmath49 and @xmath43 consistent with the non - linearly realized su(4@xmath21 symmetry .",
    "equivalently , the low energy effective lagrangian consists of all possible operators involving @xmath10 and @xmath11 consistent with the nonlinearly realized  symmetry , but with additional relations among the coefficients of the various terms enforced by the larger su(4@xmath21 global symmetry . in particular ,",
    "dangerous operators which violate the custodial su(2 ) symmetry , such as that in eq .",
    "( [ problem ] ) , are forbidden at leading order .",
    "any potential for the pngbs can arise only from those interactions that explicitly violate the @xmath50 global symmetry , in particular the   gauge symmetry and the yukawa couplings . in the low - energy effective lagrangian these interactions can be written down explicitly in terms of the fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 , exactly as in the original model .",
    "the sm fermions can be embedded , anomaly - free , under , by promoting sm doublets of su(2 ) to triplets or anti - triplets as required @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the yukawa interactions of the low energy effective theory arise from non - renormalizable interactions between the sm fermions and the fermions that condense to form the higgs .",
    "consider , for concreteness , the top yukawa coupling .",
    "the third - generation left - handed quark doublet , @xmath51 , is enlarged to an su(3 ) triplet with u(1 ) charge 1/3 , @xmath52 .",
    "this triplet couples to two @xmath53 singlets @xmath54 and @xmath55 through the following terms : @xmath56 where only the su(3 ) gauge indices are shown explicitly .",
    "this leads to the couplings below in the low energy effective theory after the su(2 ) groups get strong : @xmath57 these interactions , which are familiar from the original model , give rise to the top yukawa coupling while eliminating the one - loop quadratic divergences from the top loop .",
    "we leave the important question of the uv origin of the higher dimensional operators in eq.([nryukawa ] ) for future work .     symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "the moose has an @xmath50 flavor symmetry , with gauged subgroup @xmath58 .",
    "one condensing @xmath59 group is also present , and each link field is a bifundamental fermion under the neighboring global symmetries . ]    it is interesting to note that there is another configuration which also generates exactly the symmetry breaking pattern of the simplest little higgs with a custodial su(2 ) symmetry . as pointed out in @xcite , the global symmetry breaking pattern @xmath60 with a subgroup f of g gauged has the same low energy dynamics as a two - site nonlinear sigma model with global symmetry breaking pattern @xmath61 and gauged subgroup @xmath62 , in the limit that the gauge coupling constant of h is large .",
    "this two - site model can in principle be uv completed , provided the @xmath61 breaking pattern is a generalization of qcd - type confining dynamics .    since the pattern @xmath63",
    ", we can use this technique to realize symmetry breaking in the simplest little higgs .",
    "the appropriate construction is shown in figure ( [ fig : su3alt ] ) ; to replicate exactly the simplest little higgs we simply repeat this construction twice and gauge the same  symmetry in each case .",
    "the nmm model @xcite is built around the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath64 .",
    "the same pattern also arises in several other little higgs models @xcite .",
    "we now show that the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath65 , which is equivalent to @xmath66 , can be realized through strong dynamics .",
    "consider an su(@xmath67 ) gauge group , with a set of four fermions , @xmath68 , in the fundamental representation . here",
    "@xmath23 represents an su(@xmath67 ) gauge index and @xmath24 labels the fermions from 1 through 4 .",
    "we also add a set of four fermions in the conjugate representation @xmath69 .",
    "when the su(@xmath67 ) theory gets strong , a condensate @xmath70 forms and breaks the @xmath71 flavor symmetry to the diagonal su(4 ) .",
    "we label the 15 resulting ngbs that are produced by @xmath37 , and define        we also add to the theory a non - renormalizable term @xmath73",
    "\\sim m^2 { \\rm tr } \\left [ x j x^t j \\right]\\ ] ] which is allowed by the gauge symmetries .",
    "the effect of this term is to explicitly break the global @xmath74 symmetry to @xmath75 , thereby giving a mass of order @xmath76 to 5 of the 15 ngbs . with the addition of this term",
    "the pattern of global symmetry breaking is in fact @xmath65 , which accounts for the 10 surviving ngbs . the unbroken global symmetry , the diagonal sp(4 ) , contains the custodial su(2 ) symmetry we desire .    to reproduce the nmm gauge symmetry breaking pattern , we weakly gauge an @xmath77 subgroup of the @xmath78 symmetry , and an @xmath79 symmetry of the @xmath80 global symmetry , as shown in figure [ fig : nmm ] . here",
    "@xmath81 is the diagonal generator of the other su(2@xmath82 subgroup contained in @xmath80 .",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken to the diagonal  of the sm and 6 ngbs are eaten .",
    "the remaining 4 light pngbs constitute a single complex higgs doublet .",
    "the custodial su(2 ) symmetry is preserved by the kinetic terms up to small corrections arising from integrating out the states of mass @xmath76 .",
    "provided @xmath76 is larger than or of order a tev , these are under control .",

    "it is now straightforward to reproduce the complete symmetry breaking pattern of the nmm model by repeating the breaking pattern @xmath83 multiple times . here",
    "we limit ourselves to constructing a model with just a single link that reproduces the main features of the nmm model .",
    "the fermion sector is straightforward and anomaly - free .",
    "each sm su(2 ) doublet , @xmath51 or @xmath84 , transforms under @xmath85 and emerges from a fundamental of @xmath78 , which we denote by @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "a second doublet , @xmath88 or @xmath89 , which transforms under @xmath90 fills out @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",

    "the quark yukawa couplings emerge from @xmath95 one linear combination of @xmath96 and @xmath97 acquires a mass of order @xmath5 , while the other linear combination is the usual sm singlet , @xmath98 .",
    "a similar story holds for the down - type quarks .",
    "the invariance of the first term under su(4@xmath99 guarantees the cancellation of one loop quadratic divergences from the quark sector .",
    "the generalization to leptons is straightforward .",
    "the states with mass @xmath76 are not present in the original nmm model , but constitute a firm prediction of our construction .",
    "in particular , they will be present in any uv completion that realizes the pattern of symmetry breaking in the same manner .",
    "these states are composed of a field with the same sm quantum numbers as the higgs that decays predominantly into third generation quarks , and a sm singlet .    in conclusion , we have shown how to obtain the symmetry breaking patterns of the simplest little higgs and the smallest moose with an approximate custodial su(2 ) symmetry from strong dynamics .",
