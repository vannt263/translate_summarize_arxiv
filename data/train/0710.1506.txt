    "the discovery of water vapor emission in the extreme c - rich agb star irc+10216 with swas @xcite , its confirmation by odin @xcite , and the subsequent detection of other o - bearing molecules like oh @xcite , h@xmath5co @xcite , and c@xmath6o @xcite , have challenged our current understanding of the chemistry in envelopes around c - rich agb stars . according to standard models , essentially all oxygen nuclei",
    "are predicted to be locked into co or sio with no reservoir to form other o - bearing molecules ( except for low abundances of species such as hco@xmath7 in the outer envelope where photochemistry is important ) .",
    "therefore , the unexpectedly high abundances found for h@xmath5o , oh , and h@xmath5co , indicate that several processes not included in standard models for c - rich environments are driving the oxygen chemistry , but the dominant water production mechanism is still a source of debate .",
    "four distinct mechanisms have been considered as possible sources of the observed water vapor in irc+10216 , each one making a specific prediction for the  spatial distribution in the envelope : @xmath8 chemistry in the inner envelope , which would imply the presence of  in the warmest and densest regions ; @xmath9 vaporization of icy orbiting bodies that have survived from the main sequence into the c - rich agb phase @xcite , predicting the release of  at intermediate radii of @xmath10 cm ; @xmath11 grain surface reactions , such as the fischer - tropsch catalysis on the surfaces of small metallic grains @xcite , which predicts  to attain a nearly uniform abundance at radii larger than @xmath12 cm ; @xmath13 chemistry involving photodissociation products in the outermost regions of the envelope : a specific mechanism relying on the radiative association o+h@xmath5@xmath14+@xmath15 has been proposed by agndez & cernicharo ( 2006 , hereafter ac06 ) , and predicts  to be present at radii higher than @xmath16 cm . in all cases ,   is expected to have a uniform abundance from @xmath17 up to the external region where it is photodissociated producing oh .    the only water line detected so far in irc+10216 , the ortho-   110101  transition at 557 ghz , is the ground - state transition , with the upper level at only 27 k above the ground rotational level , and can not discriminate -by itself- between the processes listed above .",
    "nevertheless , the launch of the herschel space observatory ( hso ) will allow us to observe other  lines in the submillimeter and far - infrared domains , permitting us to infer the region where the  emission arises , and will potentially favor one of the proposed formation mechanisms .",
    "the heterodyne instrument for the far infrared ( hifi ) onboard hso will provide very high spectral resolution observations ( 0.14 - 1.0 mhz ) , thus permitting the lines to be velocity resolved . in this paper , we model the  emission from irc+10216 to show how the  spatial distribution can be inferred from hso multi - transition observations .",
    "also , we explore which  transition provides the most sensitive means of searching for water vapor around agb stars other than irc+10216 ; such a search would determine whether the occurence of  in c - rich environments is widespread .",
    "our model for irc+10216 assumes a stellar mass loss rate of @xmath18  yr@xmath19 .",
    "the gas velocity field , turbulent velocity , and h@xmath5 density and gas temperature profiles are those adopted by @xcite ( see references therein ) , and listed in table  [ tab : envel ] .",
    "a distance to the source @xmath20 pc is assumed .",
    "the adopted gas temperature profile is an approximate fit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the results obtained by @xcite , who calculated the thermal profile through the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 from the energetic balance between gas heating and cooling .",
    "these calculations included gas - dust collisional heating and both adiabatic and co line cooling .",
    "hcn line cooling was ignored and , subsequently , the iso far - infrared spectrum of irc+10216 showed strong hcn rotational emission from both the ground and excited vibrational states @xcite . nevertheless , radiative transfer calculations appear to indicate that hcn radiative excitation through absorption of infrared photons emitted by warm dust dominates over collisional excitation @xcite , and in such a case the observed hcn emission would not involve any further cooling",
    ".    it is shown below that the continuum emission provides the dominant excitation source for all  lines of interest , mainly through absorption of 6 @xmath3 m photons in the @xmath0 band and subsequent decay , and so a model for the dust emission from irc+10216 is required .",
    "we have used a radiative transfer code to compute , from the balance between heating and cooling at any radial position in the envelope , the dust temperature profile @xcite .",
    "our model simulates the dust properties by making use of an empirical spectral index @xmath21 .",
    "the inferred dust parameters are listed in table  [ tab : envel ] , and the goodness of the fit , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] , ensures that the continuum radiation density is well reproduced at least at @xmath22 cm , where it varies as @xmath23 .",
    "the radiative transfer code used to determine the  excitation and emission has been described in @xcite .",
    "the calculations assume spherical symmetry , and the envelope is divided into 60 spherical shells to account for the variations in the physical and chemical conditions with distance to the star . the dust and  are assumed to be coexistent within any shell , and the non - local radiative transfer is simulated through rays that cross the source .",
    "the code first computes the  statistical equilibrium populations at any radial position in the envelope with the use of an iterative procedure based on an approximate newton - raphson operator @xcite .",
    "a maximum relative variation of populations of @xmath24 was established as the convergence criterion ; a much tighter criterion was found in some test models to change line fluxes by at most 0.2% .",
    "once convergence is achieved , the resulting line profiles and fluxes are calculated .",
    "we report the expected intensities in units of main - beam temperature ( @xmath25 ) , with a half - power beam width of hpbw=240@xmath26 to simulate swas measurements , and hpbw ranging from @xmath27 ( 1703 - 1910 ghz ) to @xmath28 ( 480 - 640 ghz ) for hso - hifi observations ( see table  [ tab : h2otrans ] , below ) .",
    "spectroscopic data for  were taken from the hitran 2004 database @xcite .",
    "we included the ground and the @xmath29 and @xmath30 excited vibrational states , but the @xmath30 state was found to have a negligible effect on the emission from the ground state lines .",
    "the @xmath31 state was ignored because the @xmath32 band is much weaker than the @xmath1 band , and more excited vibrational levels are also ignorable because they are weakly connected to the ground vibrational state and/or the continuum emission from irc+10216 weakens in the near infrared .",
    "up to 40 rotational levels per vibrational state for both ortho-  and para-  were taken into account , but the code allows this number to be decreased in external regions with low excitation , with the aim of ensuring and accelerating convergence .",
    "the calculations simulate both collisional excitation among rotational levels of the ground vibrational state , and radiative excitation in all transitions .",
    "vibrational excitation through collisions is neglected .",
    "collisional rates among the 10 lowest rotational levels for @xmath33 k are taken from @xcite .",
    "we extrapolate these rates to higher @xmath34 by multiplying the excitation rates for @xmath35 k by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the energy difference between the upper and lower levels .",
    "the application of this strategy appears to be justified , since the use of the @xcite collisional rates at @xmath35 k , together with the quoted extrapolation , yield collisional rates for @xmath38 k that reproduce the values given by @xcite within a factor of 1.6 .",
    "also , some estimate of the collisional rates among levels not considered by @xcite is required to simulate the collisional excitation in the innermost regions of the envelope . with this aim",
    ", we have found that if the -he collisional excitation rates for the 10 lowest rotational levels given by @xcite , are multiplied by a global factor of 5 , _ most _ of the h@xmath5 @xmath39 rates given by @xcite are reproduced within a factor of 2.5 ; similarly , _ most _ of the h@xmath5 @xmath40 rates given by @xcite are reproduced within the same factor if the green et al .",
    "rates are multiplied by a factor of 1.35 , the difference in reduced mass when h@xmath5 is the collision partner rather than he . after applying these corrections to the @xcite coefficients ,",
    "some individual rates are still strongly underestimated , by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , relative to the @xcite values , specially in the case of collisions between para-  @xmath41 and h@xmath5 @xmath39 ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    ". nevertheless , the collisional excitation of a high - energy level in high - density and high - temperature regions is the result of collisional pumping from various other levels , and so individual discrepancies are to some extent diluted . in summary",
    ", we have used the @xcite excitation rates , multiplied by the factors quoted above , to simulate the collisional excitation among levels not considered in @xcite .",
    "the adopted extrapolation does not critically affect results because , as shown below , radiative excitation dominates over collisional excitation in all lines of interest .",
    "we have generated a set of models that differ only in the inner radius of the  shell , @xmath17 , and in the  abundance , @xmath42 ( ) . the different values of @xmath17 account for different spatial distributions of  in the envelope of irc+10216 , and @xmath42 ( ) is derived in such a way that the predicted flux of the o-  110101  is @xmath43 w @xmath44 as observed by swas @xcite .",
    "the ortho - to - para  abundance ratio is assumed to be 3:1 . in all models ,",
    "we have adopted an external radius of the  shell @xmath45 cm , where  is assumed to be photodissociated .",
    "this value of @xmath46 is similar to that obtained by @xcite and ac06 through photodissociation models of the external shells of the irc+10216 circumstellar envelope .",
    "the photodissociation radius depends on several parameters and could be significantly lower than the quoted value @xcite , but test models indicate that line flux ratios for @xmath47 cm vary by less than 20% if @xmath46 is decreased to @xmath48 cm . for high values of @xmath17 ,",
    "we give in section [ sec : radassoc ] an analytic expression for the expected flux of the o-  110101  line as a function of both @xmath17 and @xmath46 , showing that results are not very sensitive to @xmath46 as long as @xmath49 .",
    "we have selected three of those models , called @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , that correspond to the proposed formation mechanisms described in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath17 and the inferred ortho-  abundance , @xmath42(o- ) , are listed in table  [ tab : h2omodels ] .",

    "the formation of  due to fischer - tropsch catalysis on the surfaces of iron grains predicts that the  abundance attains its maximum value at @xmath54 cm @xcite .",
    "therefore , these two models predict similar  spatial distributions , although the fischer - tropsch mechanism appears to be more restrictive .",

    "our values for @xmath46 are one order of magnitude larger than the radius of the oh shell calculated by @xcite . for high ,",
    "our resulting values for @xmath46 are much larger than the assumed @xmath133 cm , and results are not sensitive to the adopted value for @xmath46 . however , for @xmath134  yr@xmath19 , the finite size for the  shell ( e.g. @xmath135 ) starts to lower the expected line fluxes , in particular that of the 557 ghz line .",
    "since @xcite obtain values for @xmath46 that are still much lower than ours , one should consider with caution the  fluxes predicted for @xmath134  yr@xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the photodissociation rate in the unshielded interstellar radiation field ( @xmath136 s@xmath19 ) yields , for a 15 km s@xmath19 flow , a lengthscale of @xmath137 cm . for @xmath59",

    "_ all sources above the solid line would be detected with 1.5 hours of observing time in the 557 ghz line if the  outflow rate were equal or higher than the value found in irc+10216 , and if the photodissociation radius of the molecules remains sufficiently large relative to @xmath17_. the sensitivity limits for the 1113 and 1670 ghz lines are also displayed , and show that the detection of these lines require significantly higher 6.3 @xmath3 m continuum fluxes .",
    "we conclude that the 557 ghz line provides the most sensitive means of searching for  in c - rich agb stars other than irc+10216 with hso .",
    "our models for irc+10216 predict that , whatever the region where  is formed or released to the outflow ,  is radiatively excited , which implies that model results are independent of the gas temperature and density profiles .",
    "this result relies on the extrapolation to higher @xmath34 of the collisional rates given by @xcite , which will require further confirmation from new estimates of -h@xmath5 collisional rates at higher temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , we find that collisional rates would have to be about one order of magnitude higher than estimated to compete efficiently with the radiative rates in the innermost regions of the envelope , which seems somewhat implausible .",
    "a relatively uncertain parameter in our models is the assumed distance to irc+10216 , @xmath20 pc .",
    "it has been proposed that the distance may be substantially smaller , @xmath150 pc @xcite . at 170 pc ,",

    "since the closer proximity and weaker 6 @xmath3 m radiation density have opposite effects on the  outflow rate required to match the swas 557 ghz flux , the latter will decrease by less than a factor 2 , and thus the expected  abundance will be a factor of @xmath154 higher than in table  [ tab : h2omodels ] .",
    "therefore , we conservatively estimate an o-  abundance in the range @xmath4 for @xmath59 cm . concerning the line ratios to be observed by hso",
    ", we expect values similar to those obtained at @xmath20 pc if the line emission remains unresolved , i.e. for low values of @xmath17 . for high values of @xmath17",
    ", beam effects will be more important at @xmath153 pc , diminishing the low - excitation line fluxes relative to the 557 ghz line .",
    "a potentially more important source of uncertainty is the assumption of spherical symmetry in our models .",
    "both the molecular and dust emission from irc+10216 show evidence for departures from a smooth distribution in a spherically symmetric outflow ; incomplete , discrete shells or arcs and clumpy structures are instead observed on a wide range of distances to the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even more important , the oh line shapes observed in irc+10216 strongly suggest an asymmetric distribution of oh in the outer regions of the envelope @xcite , thus also suggesting an asymmetric distribution of the parent  molecule .",
    "these asymmetries may alter to some extent the  line flux ratios calculated with the use of our spherically symmetric approach .",
    "while in spherical symmetry the emission from any line is isotropic , in filamentary structures or slabs of velocity - coherent gas the optically thick lines radiate preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the two faces of the sheet @xcite , whereas the emission from thinner lines will approach a more isotropic behavior .",
    "future hso observations will show the importance of the observed morphological complexity on the line fluxes by showing whether the different  line flux ratios are consistent with a single value of @xmath17 , or indicate a range of values .",
    "finally , the models assume a water shell with uniform  abundance and sharp inner and outer radii ; however , a finite abundance gradient obviously takes place at both the  formation and dissociation regions , and variations of the  abundance across the shell are also possible .",
    "these effects may also alter to some extent the expected line flux ratios .",
    "uncertainties in the outer radius of the  shell may also affect the expected fluxes from stars with low mass loss rates .",
    "both the cometary and fischer - tropsch catalysis hypothesis predict   to be released or formed at intermediate radii of _ a few _ @xmath155 cm , and although no specific mechanism has been proposed for  formation at the innermost regions ( @xmath156 cm ) , this possibility can not be rejected .",

    "the search for water emission at 557 ghz in c - rich agb stars other than irc+10216 will also favour one of the two hypotheses : since irc+10216 is at the high end of mass loss rates from c - rich stars , and the efficiency of fischer - tropsch catalysis to form  molecules is expected to decrease with diminishing , one would expect in such a case a rate of detection significantly lower than that quantified in section  [ sec : crich ] for the cometary hypothesis , and one would expect a pronounced decline of the  abundance with diminishing",

    "this flux is very similar to that computed for the quoted line in model @xmath51 ( @xmath133 cm ) .",

    "<S> regardless of the spatial distribution of the water molecules , the  @xmath2 line at 557 ghz observed by the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( swas ) is found to be pumped primarily through the absorption of dust - emitted photons at 6 @xmath3 m in the @xmath0 band . as noted by previous authors </S>",
    "<S> , the inclusion of radiative pumping lowers the ortho-  abundance required to account for the 557 ghz emission , which is found to be @xmath4 if the presence of   is a consequence of vaporization of orbiting comets or fischer - tropsch catalysis . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for other submillimeter  lines that can be observed by the _ herschel space observatory _ ( hso ) are reported . </S>",
    "<S> multitransition hso observations promise to reveal the spatial distribution of the circumstellar water vapor , discriminating among the several hypotheses that have been proposed for the origin of the   vapor in the envelope of irc+10216 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , for observations with hso , the  @xmath2 557 ghz line affords the greatest sensitivity in searching for  in other c - rich agb stars . </S>"
