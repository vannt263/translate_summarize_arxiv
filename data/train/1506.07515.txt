    "plane curves are the simplest forms that have shape : we can easily recognize objects in cartoons or outlines of images . here",
    ", we introduce a novel way to represent and combine the shape of plane curves that has the twin virtues of mathematical elegance and intuitive simplicity .",
    "a plane curve is formally described as a continuous mapping from a closed interval of real numbers to a 2-d euclidean plane , @xmath0 , _",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the 1-d coordinate parameterization along the curve . if the natural , _ arc - length _ coordinate is used ( such that @xmath3 ) , the derivative of the curve with respect to @xmath4 yields a unit - length velocity vector : @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that the curve shape can be fully characterized by the velocity vector s orientation along the curve , _",
    "i.e. _ , the _ angle profile _ @xmath6 , since the length of the vector does not contain any shape information .    the angle profile representation is widely used for identification and categorization of curve shapes , as well as shape synthesis @xcite . in particular ,",
    "one of the most widely used shape description methods , called _ fourier descriptors _ , analyzes angle profiles of curves as linear combinations of their frequency components @xcite .",
    "however , such analysis has serious drawbacks , because the operation for combining angle profiles does not properly translate to combination of shape features .",
    "( see appendix  a ) .    here",
    ", we introduce a novel , _ log - radius profile _ representation that is dual to the angle profile representation .",
    "this representation resolves the problems of the angle profile representation , and provides a new operation for combining shape features .    .",
    "see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waxwov0yqfe for a movie showing how the shape varies with continuously changing frequency .",

    "consider a subset of plane curves with monotonically increasing angle profiles , called _",
    "convex curves_. such a curve admits an alternative , angle - based parameterization , @xmath7 , since any point on the curve can be uniquely specified by @xmath8 .",
    "the angle coordinate , like arc - length , is a natural parameterization of a curve , determined uniquely by the curve s geometry .",
    "moreover , it is scale invariant | the coordinate value of a point remains unchanged under scaling operations on the curve .",
    "differentiating a curve with respect to @xmath8 yields a velocity vector whose length is the local radius of curvature : @xmath9 then , the shape of a convex curve can be fully characterized by the _ radius profile _",
    "@xmath10 along the curve , because the orientation of the velocity vector only provides redundant information that is already specified by the angle coordinate .",
    "to summarize , the radius - profile describes the length of the velocity vector as a function of the orientation , whereas the angle - profile describes the orientation of the velocity vector as a function of the arc - length : they provide complementary ways to represent curves .",
    "however , since we will consider scaling operations on curves , it is more convenient to introduce the _ log - radius profile _ representation , @xmath11 , defined as @xmath12",
    "a circle is a simple featureless curve , described by a constant log - radius of curvature .",
    "however , interesting shape features are described by fluctuations of the log - radius profiles .",
    "let us define _ elementary shapes _ by sinusoidal log - radius profiles : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the frequency , @xmath15 is the amplitude and @xmath16 is the phase shift , which rotates the shape ( fig .  [ fig : elementary_shapes ] ) .",
    "each elementary shape exhibits a distinctive feature characterized by the frequency @xmath14 .",
    "for example , the elongated shape of an elliptic curve is characterized by frequency 2 , whose log - radius profile oscillates twice per one full rotation of @xmath8 , or @xmath17 radians . at larger integer frequencies ,",
    "the shapes resemble rounded regular polygons . in general , an elementary shape with a rational frequency @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are coprime integers ( _ i.e. _ no common factors ) and @xmath21 , has a closed shape of period @xmath22 , and exhibits @xmath19 degrees of rotational symmetry . if @xmath23 , then the curve does not close and exhibits a translational symmetry . in the zero frequency limit , the elementary shape approaches a logarithmic spiral : @xmath24 .    the amplitude @xmath15 modulates the degree of expression of elementary shapes , while preserving their characteristic features ( see fig  [ fig : scalar_multiplication_addition]a ) .",
    "uniform scaling is the simplest operation on a curve , which scales the overall size of the curve while preserving its shape . in our representation",
    ", this corresponds to adding a constant to the log - radius profile .",
    "more generally , we define two operations on convex curves , @xmath25 : scalar multiplication ( fig  [ fig : scalar_multiplication_addition]a ) @xmath26 which amplifies the log - radius profile by a scalar factor @xmath27 , and addition between two curves ( fig  [ fig : scalar_multiplication_addition]b ) @xmath28 which adds their log - radius profiles in a pointwise manner @xmath29 .",
    "the addition operation can be understood as a generalized scaling operation , which uses one curve s log - radius profile as the scale factor for modifying the other curve .",
    "it reduces to uniform scaling if one of the curves is a circle .",
    "the unit circle , @xmath30 , is the identity element of the addition operation .",
    "remarkably , the addition operation exquisitely merges the shape features of the added curves in a visually intuitive manner ( see fig  [ fig : scalar_multiplication_addition]b ) . for examples , adding a shrinking spiral progressively decreases the length scale of the curve , thereby  spiralizing \" its shape , whereas adding an ellipse elongates the curve in one direction and compresses it in the perpendicular direction , thereby  elliptizing \" the curve .",
    "thus , adding a spiral and an ellipse produces an elliptic spiral , which combines the shape features of both curves .",
    "this accurate combination of shape features owes to the angle coordinate representation , which is invariant under scaling operations .",
    "the scalar multiplication and addition operations define a vector space over the set of convex curves , which is spanned by the basis set of elementary shape curves eq  ; that is , any curve in this space can be represented as a linear combination of elementary curves .",
    "moreover , an inner - product between curves can be defined as , @xmath31 which induces a norm @xmath32 .",
    "thus , convex curves with finite norm ( @xmath33 ) form a hilbert space , isomorphic to the space of square - integrable functions , @xmath34 .",
    "we presented a novel , log - radius profile representation for describing convex shapes , which is dual to the standard , angle profile - based representation and offers a complementary view of curve shapes . the angle profile representation is closely related to  bending \" operations : the simplest curve is a straight line , which can be bent into various curves . in contrast , the log - radius profile representation is closely related to  scaling \" operations : the simplest curve is a circle , which can be non - uniformly scaled into other curve shapes .",
    "the log - radius profile representation resolves the aforementioned problems of the angle profile representation ( see appendix  a ) : the elementary curves preserve their characteristic shape features over all range of amplitude , and the addition operation accurately combines the shape features .",
    "therefore , fourier transform of log - radius profiles indeed properly analyzes the curve shapes into visually meaningful shape features .",
    "recent applications of this method have revealed surprising details of regularities in kinematics of curved hand movements @xcite , as well as in speed perception of curved motion @xcite .",
    "it may also be useful in investigating the shape perception process in vision . here , we considered representation of 1-d convex curves in 2-d space",
    ". this result can be generalized to higher dimensional , convex surfaces .",
    "the angle coordinate then becomes related to normal vector to the surface and inverse gauss map .",
    "i thank terrence j. sejnowski for helpful comments . this research was supported by gatsby charitable foundation .",
    "the fourier descriptor method describes the angle profile of a curve as a linear combination of frequency components @xmath35 where @xmath36 $ ] is the normalized arc - length coordinate and @xmath37 determines the total number of turns ( @xmath17 for simple closed curves ) @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 are called fourier descriptors .",
    "however , such approach has serious drawbacks .",
    "first , the curve shape described by a single frequency component @xmath39 exhibits a wildly varying shape as the coefficient @xmath40 increases ( fig  [ fig : angle_profile_failure ] , top ) , thus failing to represent a unique , consistent shape feature .",
    "secondly , in the angle profile representation , linear addition of the frequency components does not properly combine their shape features , but tends to produce rather deformed shapes ( fig  [ fig : angle_profile_failure ] , bottom ) .",
    "therefore , decomposing an angle profile into the frequency components via fourier transform does not properly translate to a meaningful analysis of the curve s shape into basic shape features ."
