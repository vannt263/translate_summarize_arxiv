    "given a square integrable function @xmath4 many properties of the system of integer translates @xmath5 can be completely described in terms of properties of the @xmath6-periodic function @xmath7 called the periodization function of @xmath8 ( note that @xmath9 ) .",
    "systems of integer translates arise in the context of wavelet analysis and , more generally , in the theory of shift invariant spaces .",
    "we refer the reader to the work of hernndez , iki , weiss , and wilson , @xcite and to references contained therein for a comprehensive summary of these properties .",
    "in this paper we focus on @xmath0-linear independence .",
    "first of all , let us pass to recall different concepts of independence in great generality .",
    "let @xmath10 be a sequence in a hilbert space @xmath11 .",
    "we say that    * @xmath10 is _ linearly independent _ if every finite subsequence of @xmath10 is linearly independent .",

    "* @xmath10 is _ minimal _ if for all @xmath18 , @xmath19    since we will not always be dealing with unconditionally convergent series , we order @xmath20 as it is usually done with fourier series .    hence by @xmath21 we mean @xmath22    so @xmath23 is @xmath0- linearly independent if and only if whenever @xmath24 and @xmath25 then necessarily @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "relations between the various type of independence for @xmath23 and properties of the periodization function are summarized in the following scheme : @xmath28    in particular , it is known that @xmath29 a question raised in @xcite is the following : is the converse true ?",
    "iki , and speegle @xcite have given a positive answer if @xmath30 is bounded ; see also paluszyski s paper @xcite , where it is proved that @xmath31 a.e . is equivalent to @xmath32-cesro linear independence of @xmath33 the latter means that if the cesro averages @xmath34 tend to zero in @xmath32 norm , then necessarily @xmath35 for all @xmath36    the approach we used in addressing this problem was global in nature : rather than examining the assumptions to be put on a single @xmath8 , we preferred to analyze the issue as a whole , for all @xmath37 .",
    "the result is that the converse is true for any @xmath8 if and only if the following statement on fourier analysis is true : for any ( lebesgue ) measurable subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 $ ] , with positive measure @xmath38 , we can find a non trivial square summable function , with support in @xmath3 whose partial sums of fourier series are uniformly bounded . by support of @xmath39 ( denoted @xmath40 ) we mean the smallest closed set @xmath41 such that @xmath42 almost everywhere in the complement of @xmath41 .",
