    "theorem  [ thm1 ] suggests that any method for computation in a hypercube that is based on one of the familiar definitions of the degree of a multivariate polynomial , namely total degree or maximal degree , is likely to be suboptimal .",
    "for example , a standard idea of multidimensional quadrature ( cubature ) is the exact integration of multivariate polynomial approximations of a given total degree , an idea going back to maxwell  @xcite . for functions @xmath26 with approximately angle - independent complexity in the hypercube , the suboptimality factors may be exponentially large as @xmath133 , since the number of degrees of freedom increases by @xmath134 when the degree increases by @xmath5 .",
    "for example , in @xmath135 dimensions , our results suggest that isotropic analytic functions can be resolved to a given accuracy by polynomials of fixed euclidean degree with @xmath136 times fewer degrees of freedom than polynomials of fixed total degree , and @xmath137 times fewer degrees of freedom than polynomials of fixed maximal degree",
    ". we shall not give details here , since these are discussed in section  6 of  @xcite with formulas and a table to quantify the exponential effects .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] is only an upper bound , so in principle , the difference it suggests between @xmath32 and the other degrees @xmath16 and @xmath33 might be illusory",
    ". however , numerical experiments such as that of figure  [ fig ] and those reported in  @xcite make it clear that the difference is genuine .",
    "this could be made rigorous by the development of a converse theorem , as has been long established in the 1d case , again thanks to bernstein ( see theorem  8.3 of  @xcite ) .    in closing",
    "i would like to highlight a conceptual link between this note and my earlier paper  @xcite with nick hale .",
    "the central observation of  @xcite is that the resolving power of ( univariate ) polynomials on an interval @xmath4 $ ] is nonuniform , making polynomials fall short of optimality by a factor of @xmath138 in representing functions whose complexity on @xmath4 $ ] is uniform . in the present work ,",
    "the issue is again nonuniformity of polynomials , but now they are multivariate and the uniformity issue pertains to rotation rather than translation . as pointed out in section  7 of  @xcite , the translational issue is present in multiple dimensions too .",
    "i have benefitted from extensive discussions of approximation and cubature in the hypercube with hadrien montanelli and klaus wang .",
