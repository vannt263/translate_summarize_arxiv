    "w28 is a striking example of tev ( 10@xmath6  ev ) gamma - ray emission spatially overlapping with molecular gas  @xcite .",
    "w28 is part of the increasing list of sources with spatial overlap between tev or gev ( 10@xmath7  ev ) gamma - ray emission and molecular gas ( e.g. hess  j1745 - 290/snr  g359.1 - 0.5  @xcite , hess  j1714 - 385/ctb  37a  @xcite , hess  j1923 + 141/snr  g49.2 - 0.7  @xcite , ic  443  @xcite ) , in addition to the central molecular zone ( cmz ) towards the galactic centre region  @xcite .",
    "w28 is a mixed morphology old age ( @xmath8yr ;  @xcite ) supernova remnant ( snr ) with dimensions of 50@xmath9 .",
    "w28 is estimated to be at a distance of 1.2 to 3.3kpc ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown to exhibit non - thermal radio emission  @xcite , thermal x - ray emission @xcite , and , more recently gamma - ray emission at tev  @xcite and gev  @xcite energies .",
    "several co surveys in the ( 1 - 0 ) , ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) lines reveal massive molecular clouds to the north - east ( ne ) and to the south ( s ) of the snr @xcite .",
    "most of the co emission appears centred at a local standard of rest velocity ( ) similar to that inferred for w28 @xmath07(corresponding to a distance @xmath10kpc ) based on studies @xcite .",
    "the molecular clouds ne of w28 are known to exhibit broad co line emission .",
    "it has been argued that w28 has disrupted much of this gas , giving rise to its broad velocity distribution  @xcite . the most likely mechanism for this type of disruption would be the snr shock interacting with the molecular gas , as is the case for other sources e.g. hess  j1745 - 290/snr  g359.1 - 0.5  @xcite , hess  j1714 - 385/ctb  37a  @xcite , hess  j1923 + 141/snr  g49.2 - 0.7  @xcite and ic  443  @xcite .",
    "all of these sources similarly display 1720mhz oh masers and are mature snrs ( age @xmath8yr ) .",
    "our 3 observations  @xcite revealed that the w28 snr shock has disrupted the dense core of the ne cloud , and strong 3(3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) detections with broad line widths ( fwhm @xmath11 ) , suggest that this region is warm and turbulent .",
    "the shocked ne cloud also provides an opportunity to study the diffusion and propagation of crs into molecular clouds .",
    "additionally , the effects of a snr shock propagating through a dense molecular cloud can be studied and search for sites of star formation triggered by the passing shock .",
    "the southern clouds harbour sites of high mass star formation , containing multiple regions , g6.225 - 0.569 , g6.1 - 0.6  @xcite and the ultracompact region ( uc ) g5.89 - 0.39 , ( see e.g  @xcite ) .",
    "a recently detected 1720mhz oh maser towards a candidate snr g5.71 - 0.08  @xcite may also suggest that there is another snr shock with molecular gas interaction occurring in one of the southern clouds .",
    "a key question is whether the w28 snr has disrupted the southern clouds and is responsible for the tev emission , or whether other high energy processes are at play .",
    "the star formation activity present in the southern clouds may play a part in the production of tev emission , as theory into protostellar particle acceleration may suggest  @xcite .",
    "the the tev gamma - ray emission detected towards the ne cloud has strong evidence supporting the hadronic emission mechanism . in order to model leptonic scenarios , uncomfortably low magnetic fields and gas densities",
    "are required  @xcite .",
    "these requirements contradict with the observed molecular gas densities @xmath12  @xcite and the magnetic field enhancements seen in dense molecular clouds  @xcite .",
    "the key question relates to the origin of the tev particles . provided the hadronic emission scenario , a population of high energy particles are required to interact with the dense clouds . for the ne cloud ,",
    "the snr shock is the obvious source of accelerated particles .",
    "however , the same can not be conclusively said about the southern sources .",
    "crs accelerated by w28 in the past may have propagated south to illuminate the southern clouds .",
    "additionally , multiple regions and sites of star formation , including the energetic uccomplex g5.89 - 0.39 , could assist in cr acceleration towards the southern tev sources .    since the common and abundant gas tracer , co , with a critical density of 10@xmath13 , rapidly becomes optically thick towards clumps and cores , probing the molecular cloud density profile",
    "can be impaired .",
    "ideal tracers of dense gas are those with a lower abundance ( 10@xmath14co ) and higher critical density ( 10@xmath15-@xmath16 ) . using the mopra telescope , we @xcite conducted broad scale ( @xmath17square ) observations of the w28 field in a 12 mm line survey .",
    "taking advantage of the 23ghz 3 inversion lines , the cold dense interiors of the molecular clouds were probed and revealed dense gas spatially consistent with both the co gas and tev emission .    in order to further probe the structure and details of the w28 field molecular clouds ,",
    "we have continued to use the mopra radio telescope in a 7 mm line survey to observe the cs(1 - 0 ) line , as well as other lines including sio(1 - 0 ) , class i ch@xmath18oh masers and cyanopolyynes hc@xmath19n ( @xmath20 ) , to trace the dense gas , the presence of shocks , outflows , and disrupted gas , and sites of high - mass star formation .",
    "the 43ghz cs(1 - 0 ) line is a useful warm , dense gas tracer , and , as cs also exists in various isotopologue forms , the optical depth and column density can be constrained .",
    "the higher frequency of 7 mm lines compared to our previous 12 mm observations , results in a smaller beam fwhm ( @xmath21 arcminute ) .",
    "this makes cs an ideal follow - up tracer to determine the properties of the dense and disrupted gas toward the molecular clouds in the w28 region .",
    "observations were performed with the mopra radio telescope in april of 2009 and march of 2010 and utilised the unsw mopra wide - band spectrometer ( mops ) in zoom mode .",
    "mopra is a 22 m single - dish radio telescope located @xmath0450 km north - west of sydney , australia ( @xmath22s , @xmath23e , 866 m a.s.l . ) .",
    "the 7 mm receiver operates in the 30 - 50ghz range and , when coupled with mops , allows an instantaneous 8ghz bandwidth .",
    "this gives mopra the ability to cover 40% of the 7 mm band and simultaneously observe many spectral lines .",
    "the zoom mode of mops allows observations in up to 16 windows simultaneously , where each window is 137.5mhz wide and contains 4096 channels in each of two polarisations . at 7 mm",
    "this gives mops an effective bandwidth of @xmath01000with resolution of @xmath00.2 . across the whole 7 mm band ,",
    "the beam fwhm varies from 1.37@xmath24 ( 31ghz ) to 0.99@xmath24 ( 49ghz )  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : lines ] lists the lines which mops was tuned to receive .",
    ".molecular lines and their corresponding rest frequencies which mops was tuned to receive .",
    "the final two columns indicate whether the line was detected in our mapping or deep pointing observations.[tab : lines ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]     ` on - the - fly ' ( otf ) mapping observations were based on our earlier 12 mm mapping of the w28 region .",
    "although we mapped all four tev sources , deeper observations towards the ne shocked cloud ( hess j1801 - 233 ) and southern cloud ( hess j1800 - 240b ) were obtained than toward hess j1800 - 240a & c. the observations were recorded alternating the scanning direction from ra to dec . to reduce noise levels and to eliminate artificial stripes that can be introduced when only one scanning direction is used .",
    "collectively , over both observation runs we obtained 9 passes on the ne cloud ( hess j1801 - 233 ) , 9 passes towards the southern cloud ( hess j1800 - 240b ) and 3 passes toward each of the hess j1800 - 240a and hess j1800 - 240c regions .",
    "data were reduced using the standard atnf packages , , and . for mapping data , was used to perform a bandpass calibration for each row using the preceding off - scan as a reference , and applied a linear fit to the baseline .",
    "re - gridded and combined all data from all mapping scans into a single data cube , with pixels ( @xmath25)=(15 , 15 , 0.21 ) .",
    "the mapping data were also weighted according to the relevant , gaussian - smoothed based on the mopra beam ( 1.2@xmath26 fwhm and 3@xmath26 cut - off radius ) , and pixel masked to remove noisy edge pixels .",
    "data cubes were then converted into an scantable and had a @xmath27 order polynomial function fit subtracted from each  pixel in the cube before returning the final output fits files .",
    "analysis of position - switched deep pointings employed with time - averaging , weighting by the relevant , and baseline subtraction using a linear fit after masking the 15 channels at each bandpass edge .    in both mapping and",
    "position - switched data , the antenna temperature ( corrected for atmospheric attenuation and rearward loss ) was converted to the main beam brightness temperature ( k ) , such that = /@xmath28 where @xmath28 is the mopra main beam efficiency .",
    "each line was corrected by the relevant @xmath28 following  @xcite .",
    "due to the uneven mapping exposure across the w28 field , the rms error in , ( k ) , varies . on top of the exposure dependence",
    ", there is also a frequency dependence on across the 42 - 49ghz band .",
    "for this reason in figure  [ fig : exposure ] we present a cs(1 - 0 ) peak pixel map of the w28 field with dashed boxes outlining the exposure boundaries .",
    "the numbers presented in the white boxes are the averaged achieved ( across the 42 - 49ghz band ) within that boundary .",
    "we also show in figure  [ fig : whole_velopix ] the velocity of the peak pixels to show the general velocity locations and distribution of the various clumps of cs(1 - 0 ) gas .",
    "we show the same contours on both figures  [ fig : exposure ] and  [ fig : whole_velopix ] for guidance .            for the detected lines , images of velocity - integrated intensity , position velocity ( pv ) and velocity dispersion ( )",
    "have been produced where possible ( although not all are shown ) .",
    "velocity - integrated intensity images ( 0@xmath29 moment ) are integrated over a velocity range determined by the observed line width .",
    "this was chosen to encompass the bulk of the emission from the region of interest .",
    "minimum contour levels were set based on the integrated of the emission .",
    "the integrated of each image was determined by creating additional 0@xmath29 moment maps in a velocity space either side of the velocity range of interest , ensuring the same number of channels were used .",
    "these additional moment maps were used to create pixel distribution histograms which were gaussian fitted . in this way we estimated the integrated from the gaussian fit results . on all images ,",
    "the minimum contour levels are mentioned in terms of the raw value as well as .",
    "generally the minimum accepted contour level on integrated maps is 2 .",

    "we estimate there to be 5.6@xmath139 , with h@xmath59 number density 6.1@xmath139 contained towards the ne hess j1801 - 233 tev source .",
    "we find that @xmath147erg of kinetic energy is required to produce the broad emission in the cs line profile towards the ne cloud , which is a few percent of the typical @xmath110erg of kinetic energy released in a snr .    for the southern cloud towards hess j1800 - 240b we estimate that @xmath133% of the gas mass is contained in dense clumps surrounding the regions .",
    "the southern clouds show no signs of external disruption , providing no evidence that the w28 snr shock has influenced the region .",
    "although our cs masses are treated as upper limits , we note that a somewhat independent estimate of the cs mass for clumps not part of the ne shocked cloud comes from the virial theorem .",
    "for these cases the fact that the virial mass is similar to the lte mass within a factor 2 to 3 suggests our choice of cs abundance is adequate for order of magnitude estimates . for the ne shocked cloud the virial theorem will likely not apply .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ sec : necloud ] , the ne shocked cloud mass derived from our cs observations is  10% larger than the mass from co observations , indicating that our cs abundance may be slightly overestimated here .",
    "additional systematic uncertainties arise from the unknown spectrum of crs entering the dense clouds , and , penetrating their interiors as a result of energy - dependent diffusion .",
    "equation  [ eqn : tevflux ] assumes that a cr spectral integral index of @xmath148 as expected for galactic crs ( gcrs ) impacting passive clouds some distance away .",
    "the spectral indices of the tev emission towards w28 are in fact found to be similar to gcrs so equation  [ eqn : tevflux ] should be adequate in this regard .",
    "the striking spatial match between the tev emission and the dense molecular gas suggests that the crs are able to penetrate some distance into the dense cloud core .",
    "however , the energy dependent diffusion of crs into the cloud cores  @xcite could easily suppress the predicted emission for low energies @xmath149 tev below that suggested by equation  [ eqn : tevflux ] .",
    "the level of suppression is strongly dependent on the largely unknown magnetic field structure and turbulence in the clump and is a topic beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "overall , we would like to emphasise that the uncertainties discussed above clearly motivate the need for new 1 arcmin angular resolution tev observations ( for example by cta ) in order to begin probing the diffusion properties of cr into dense molecular clouds .",
    "this work is part of our ongoing study into the molecular gas towards the w28 region , and follows our earlier 12 mm line mapping campaign .",
    "additional observations of the ne cloud snr interaction region have been conducted with mopra at 12 mm in order to extract detailed 3 inversion spectra across the cloud core .",
    "results of these observations will be the focus of a future paper to further understand the molecular gas properties in the interesting ne snr shock / molecular cloud interaction region .",
    "we thank cormac purcell for his baseline fitting and removal script . this work was supported by australian research council grants ( dp0662810 , dp1096533 ) .",
    "the mopra telescope is part of the australia telescope and is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "the university of new south wales mopra spectrometer digital filter bank used for these mopra observations was provided with support from the australian research council , together with the university of new south wales , university of sydney , monash university and the csiro .",
