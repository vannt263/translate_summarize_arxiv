    "in 2003 babar collaboration discovered a positive - parity scalar charm strange meson @xmath1 with a very narrow width  @xcite , which was confirmed by cleo  @xcite later . in the same experiment cleo also observed the @xmath7 partner state at @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "since these two states lie below the @xmath0 and @xmath9 threshold , respectively , the potentially dominant s - wave decay modes @xmath10 etc . , are kinematically forbidden .",
    "thus the radiative decays and isospin - violating strong decays become the dominant decay modes .",
    "therefore both of them are very narrow .",
    "the discovery of these two states has triggered heated discussion on their nature in literature .",
    "the key point is to understand their low masses .",
    "the mass of @xmath1 is significantly lower than the expected values in the range of @xmath11 within quark models  @xcite .",
    "the model using the heavy - quark mass expansion of the relativistic bethe - salpeter equation predicted a lower value @xmath12  @xcite , which is still higher than the experimental data by about @xmath13 .    from the experience with @xmath14 , van beveren and",
    "rupp  @xcite argued that the low mass of @xmath1 could arise from the mixing between the @xmath15 @xmath16 state and the @xmath0 continuum . in this way",
    "the lowest @xmath15 state could be pushed much lower than that expected from the quark models .",
    "the mass of @xmath2 state from the lattice qcd calculation is also significantly larger than the experimentally observed mass of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it is also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath1 might receive a large component of @xmath0 continuum , which makes the lattice simulation very difficult .",
    "the difficulty with the @xmath17 interpretation leads many authors to speculate that @xmath1 is a @xmath18 four quark state  @xcite , or a strong @xmath19 atom  @xcite .",
    "however , calculations based on the quark model show that the mass of the four quark state is much larger than that of the @xmath15 @xmath16 state  @xcite .",
    "the radiative decay of @xmath1 also favors that it is a @xmath17 state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are two @xmath15 states in the four quark system and one in the two - quark system .",
    "only one @xmath15 state has been found below the @xmath20 resonance in the experimental search by babar  @xcite , consistent with the @xmath17 interpretation .",
    "this problem has been treated with qcd sum rules in the heavy quark effective theory in ref .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 mass is consistent with the experimental data within large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "however , the central value is still larger than the data by @xmath21 .",
    "even larger result for the @xmath2 mass was obtained in the earlier work with the sum rule in full qcd  @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in the formalism of qcd sum rules , the physics of mixing with @xmath0 continuum resides in the contribution of @xmath0 continuum in the sum rule , and including this characteristic contribution should render the mass of @xmath2 lower .",
    "recently , there have been two investigations on this problem using sum rules in full qcd including the @xmath22 corrections . in ref .",
    "@xcite the value of the charm quark pole mass @xmath23 is used , and the mass of @xmath15 @xmath16 state is found to be @xmath24 higher than the experimental data . on the other hand , in ref .  @xcite the current quark mass @xmath25  ( corresponding to @xmath26 to @xmath22 ) is used , and the central value of the resulting @xmath15 @xmath16 mass is in agreement with the data . however , a low value of @xmath27 is used and the same value of the continuum threshold ( denoted by @xmath28 below ) is used for @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath29 @xmath16 .    on the other hand , the perturbative three loop , order @xmath30 correction to the two - point correlation function with one heavy and one massless quark has been calculated  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in the pole mass scheme used by many previous analyses including ref .",
    "@xcite , the perturbative expansion is far from converging .",
    "however , taking the quark mass in the modified minimal subtraction  ( @xmath31 ) scheme  @xcite , better convergence of the higher order corrections is obtained , and thus a more reliable determination of physical quantities of the lowest lying resonances becomes feasible  @xcite .    usually the contribution of two - particle continuum is neglected within the qcd sum rule formalism . however , because of the large s - wave coupling of @xmath32  @xcite and the adjacency of the @xmath2 mass to the @xmath0 threshold , this contribution may not be neglected in the considered case . in the present work , we shall therefore calculate this contribution and include it in the qcd sum rule . in the meantime",
    "we take into account the perturbative three loop order @xmath30 correction and work in the @xmath31 scheme .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 continuum contribution indeed renders both the mass and the decay constant of @xmath2 significantly lower .    in section  [ sec2 ] , we give a short overview of the traditional qcd sum rule for the scalar charm strange meson .",
    "then we derive the @xmath0 continuum contribution and write down the full sum rule in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "finally , the numerical results and our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec4 ] . some relevant formulas and expressions used in this paper",
    "are collected in appendices .",
    "we consider the scalar correlation function @xmath33 where the renormalization invariant operator @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 with @xmath27 and @xmath36 being the charm and strange quark current mass , respectively . up to a subtraction polynomial in @xmath37 , the correlation function @xmath38 satisfies the following dispersion relation @xmath39    at the quark gluon level , the spectra function @xmath40 is calculable using the renormalization group improved perturbation theory in the framework of the operator product expansion  ( ope ) .",
    "following jamin and lange  @xcite , in this paper we shall adopt the @xmath31 running quark mass scheme rather than the pole mass one , and take into account both the @xmath41 terms in the perturbation theory obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and the corrections from the light quark mass up to order @xmath42 .",
    "in addition we have included the contribution from the four quark condensation which affects the final result for @xmath2 mass only by a few @xmath43 . for convenience ,",
    "all the relevant expressions for @xmath40 at the quark - gluon level , denoted by @xmath44 , are summarized in appendix  a.    on the other hand , @xmath40 can be phenomenologically written in terms of contributions from intermediate hadronic states .",
    "generally , the spectral density at the hadronic level , denoted by @xmath45 , is taken to be the pole term of the lowest lying hadronic state plus the continuum starting from some threshold , with the latter identified with the qcd continuum @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the vector current decay constant of @xmath15 @xmath48 particle , analogous to @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is the mass of this particle , and @xmath28 is the continuum threshold above which the hadronic spectral density is modeled by that at the quark gluon level .",
    "the recent works  @xcite also use the above ansatz .    after making the borel transformation to suppress the contribution of higher excited states and",
    "invoking the quark - hadron duality , one arrives at the sum rule @xmath51 = \\int \\limits_{m_c^2}^{\\infty } dt\\ , \\frac{\\rho_{\\rm qcd}(t)}{\\pi}\\ , \\exp[-\\frac{t}{m_b^2}]\\,.\\ ] ] following ref .",
    "@xcite , the lower limit of the integration in the above equation is taken to be the charm quark pole mass @xmath52 , which can be expressed in terms of the running mass @xmath53 through the perturbative three - loop relation as defined in appendix  b.",
    "the contribution of two - particle continuum to the spectral density can safely be neglected in many cases , as usually done in the traditional qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "one typical example is the @xmath54 meson sum rule , where the two pion continuum is of p - wave nature .",
    "its contribution to the spectral density is tiny and the @xmath54 pole contribution dominates .",
    "however , there may be an exception when the @xmath15 particle couples strongly to the two - particle continuum via s - wave .",
    "in such case , there is no threshold suppression and the two - particle continuum contribution may be more significant . the strong coupling of the @xmath15 particle with the two - particle state and the adjacency of the @xmath15 mass to the @xmath0 continuum threshold result in large coupling channel effect , which corresponds to the configuration of mixing in the formalism of quark model . in the problem under consideration , the mass of @xmath1 is only about @xmath55 below the @xmath0 threshold , and the s - wave coupling of @xmath32 is found to be very large  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may have to take into account the @xmath0 continuum contribution carefully .",
    "the importance of @xmath56 continuum contribution in the sum rule for @xmath57 meson was first emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the duality consideration in the case where the @xmath57 mass is higher than the @xmath56 threshold .",
    "based on the soft pion theorem , two of us also made a crude analysis of the @xmath58 continuum contribution in the case where the @xmath15 particle mass is higher than the threshold  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we calculate the continuum contribution more carefully in the case where the @xmath15 particle mass is lower and very close to the two - particle continuum threshold .",
    "let @xmath59 be the form - factor defined by @xmath60 from the large s - wave coupling of @xmath32 and the adjacency of the @xmath2 mass to the @xmath0 threshold , one expects that in the low energy region , @xmath59 is dominated by the product of a factor of the @xmath2 pole and a factor from the final state interactions . in the low energy region with @xmath61",
    "needed in our sum rule , the effect of inelastic @xmath0 scattering is suppressed by the phase space .",
    "therefore , we take the approximation to consider only the @xmath0 scattering with only elastic intermediate states",
    ". it can be described by the @xmath32 interaction and the @xmath62 chiral interaction in the low energy effective lagrangian , which can be represented by a series of bubble diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the s - wave born amplitude of @xmath0 scattering represented by the black circles in fig .  [ fig1 ] contains three terms .",
    "the first one is the @xmath63 channel pole term @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being the @xmath32 coupling constant and @xmath66 being the mass parameter normalized at the scale @xmath67 in the effective lagrangian .",
    "the second term corresponds to the direct @xmath62 interaction in the effective lagrangian .",
    "let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be the four momentum of @xmath70 mesons in the initial and final state respectively , and @xmath71 . in the chiral effective lagrangian ,",
    "the amplitudes for the processes @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 in the low energy @xmath75 region of @xmath76 meson needed in the qcd sum rule are all equal to @xmath77\\,,\\ ] ] in the center of mass system . here",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 should be separately included in the integrals for two adjacent loops .",
    "the third term of the s - wave born amplitude arises from the crossing @xmath80 channel pole term @xmath81 where @xmath82 for simplicity , we put the on - shell values of @xmath75 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 into @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the above equations .",
    "the effect of this approximation on our final results is expected to be small , since the contribution of the @xmath80 channel pole term is relatively small . as a result",
    ", one finds that the @xmath80 channel pole term is an analytic function of @xmath63 with only a short cut , the length of which is only @xmath88 for experimental values of the corresponding masses .",
