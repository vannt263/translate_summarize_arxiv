    "stars of mass in the range @xmath9 , after the consumption of helium in the core , evolve through the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "this evolutionary phase , though extremely short compared to the duration of the core hydrogen and helium burning , is of paramount importance , because it is during the agb phase that most of the mass loss occurs , thus allowing the pollution of the interstellar medium with gas and dust .",
    "the importance of this class of objects stems from their relevance in several astrophysical contexts , such as their effect on the determination of the masses and star  formation rates of low and high redshift galaxies @xcite , their role in the chemical evolution of galaxies @xcite , and likely the formation of second generation stars in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , agb stars are efficient dust manufacturers , owing to the thermodynamic conditions of their circumstellar envelope , a favourable environment for dust formation @xcite .",
    "the evolution through the agb is as complex as it is important , owing to the delicate interface between the thermodynamic structure of the compact , degenerate core and the tenuous , expanded convective envelope . in the stellar layers separating these two regions , the main physical variables , i.e. pressure , temperature and density , drop by several orders of magnitude , thus rendering the physical and numerical description of the stellar structure problematic . to this",
    ", we add the uncertain description of convection and mass loss , which is still unknown based on first principles and thus modelled via empirical prescriptions .",
    "these are the main reasons why , despite the significant progress of agb modelling over the last few years ( e.g. , karakas & lattanzio 2014 ) , the results are still not completely reliable .",
    "the comparison between theoretical agb models with observations is crucial in order to substantially improve the predictive power of the stellar evolution models .    the magellanic clouds ( mcs )",
    "have been extensively used to test theoretical predictions and to derive information on the internal structure and on the efficiency of the mechanisms that are altering the surface chemical composition of agb stars .",
    "the near and mid  infrared ( ir ) colours of the stars observed are extremely sensitive to the dust present in the wind ; they can thus test the description of the dust formation in the circumstellar envelope , which some research groups have recently coupled with the modelling of the central star @xcite .",
    "this field of research is currently undergoing significant improvements , with the introduction of chemical  dynamical models of the circumstellar envelope which are promising replacements of the hydrostatic approximation currently used @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the _ spitzer _ data and the evolutionary sequences allowed the characterisation of the agb population of the mcs , in terms of mass , age and metallicity distribution @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the stars exhibiting the largest degree of obscuration in the mcs was shown to be a valuable indicator not only of the main physical processes taking place during the agb evolution , but also of the efficiency with which dust grains form and grow in the circumstellar envelope @xcite .    to allow a more exhaustive test of the theoretical models used so far ,",
    "it is crucial to extend this kind of analysis to environments with different metallicities and star formation histories ( sfh ) .",
    "this is now possible , thanks to the mid  ir survey of dust in nearby galaxies with _ spitzer _ ( dustings ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which provided @xmath10 m and @xmath11 m _ spitzer _ imaging of 50 dwarf galaxies within 1.5 mpc .",

    "in particular , the combination of near and mid ",
    "ir photometry is a powerful diagnostic of the agb population of dwarf galaxies , with the goal of characterizing the stars observed in terms of mass , chemical composition , and progenitor formation epoch .",
    "following the same approach adopted to study the evolved , obscured sources of the mcs , we base our analysis on the agb evolutionary sequences that account for dust formation in the wind ; this is required to correctly interpret the near and mid  ir fluxes of agb stars surrounded by dust . we also investigate the most obscured stars in the galaxy and predict the overall dust  production rate from agb stars . to date , this is the first time that this methodology is applied to galaxies other than milky way and the mcs , providing a test of the current generation of agb models in different environments .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the observational sample of agb stars considered for the analysis is described in section [ sample ] ; section [ inputs ] presents the numerical and physical inputs used to model the agb phase and to produce the synthetic population .",
    "the description of the main properties of the agb phase , including dust evolution and the impact on the ir emission , is discussed in section [ agbproperties ] ; section [ interpretation ] present the interpretation of the observations and our conclusions are offered in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this work , we focus on the irregular dwarf galaxy ic 1613 , one of the nearest gas  rich dwarf galaxies in the local group , characterized by low internal reddening and foreground contamination .",
    "this choice is mainly motivated by the numerous population of agb stars , widely studied in the literature .",

    "we adopt the mean distance of @xmath20 kpc , determined by @xcite by comparing their own measurement using rr lyrae and cepheid data to the values found in the literature .",
    "we base our analysis of the ic 1613 agb population on near and mid  ir observations .",
    "more specifically , we consider the sample of agb candidates observed by @xcite with the wide field camera ( wfcam ) mounted on ukirt , in the @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath13 bands , covering an area of 0.8 deg@xmath21 on the sky , within 4.5 kpc from the galactic centre .",

    "their criterion to select sources required that a given object has a magnitude measurement in all the three bands and that it is classified as stellar or probably stellar in at least two of the three bands.to exclude the bulk of the foreground objects , @xcite assumed a color cut of @xmath24 mag .",
    "this is not sufficient to remove completely the foreground sources , which are estimated to contaminate the sample in the central region at the level of @xmath25 . in order to identify agb candidates",
    ", they considered only stars brighter than the @xmath26 mag , i. e. the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) at the distance of ic 1613 .",
    "the resulting catalogue of agb candidates is composed of @xmath27 stars . the agb sample was further classified in c and o  rich stars , adopting the following criterion : stars were classified as o ",
    "rich if they are confined in the region @xmath28 mag , while c  stars occupy the region @xmath29 mag .",
    "indeed , there is no strict colour boundary between these two spectral types in @xmath30 and the misclassification of agb sources in both directions is probable , as we show later ( see section [ interpretation ] ) .",
    "this classification represents the red limit for the majority of the o  rich stars better than the blue limit for the c  type population @xcite .",
    "we extend the analysis to the mid  ir spectral region in order to better constrain our agb models on the basis of the dust contribution .",
    "@xcite present the dustings survey of 50 dwarf galaxies observed in and around the local group , which is designed to detect evolved stars in the dust  producing phase .",
    "ic 1613 was observed with infrared array camera in the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] bands during two epochs , reducing the effect of variability . the level of extinction in these bands results in a change in magnitude that is significantly less than the photometric uncertainties ,",
    "so we have not corrected for it .",
    "having only the measurement of the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] magnitude available , it was not possible to reduce the contamination from background and foreground sources .",
    "@xcite adopted trgb magnitude @xmath31  mag for all the 50 galaxies , considering only star brighter than this limit as agb stars . while they could not classify all detected agb stars with only the mid - ir data , they did separate a subset of individual agb stars from foreground and background sources by their magnitude changes between two epochs .",
    "we cross  correlated the sample of agb candidates by @xcite with stars from the dustings  good source \" catalogue by @xcite , using a matching radius of 1.2 arcsec . in this way we were able to select 755 objects , probably agb stars , observed in both near and mid  ir bands .",
    "10% of the agb candidates observed by @xcite are not matched with any star in the boyer s sample .",
    "the reason is that the field of view observed by ukirt is wider than the _",

    "the dynamical conditions of the wind are determined on the basis of the mass and momentum conservation , whereas the growth of dust particles is found on the basis of the gas density and the thermal velocity in the inner border of the condensation region .",
    "gas dynamics and dust grain growth are coupled via the extinction coefficient in the equation of momentum conservation , which depends on the number density and size of the grains formed .",

    "we consider the entire agb evolution , which begins with the ignition of shell helium burning ( early  agb phase ) and extends to the thermal pulse ( tp ) agb phase .      the physical and chemical evolution through the agb phase is primarily affected by the initial mass of the star , as the latter quantity determines the core mass at the beginning of the tp phase , which is the key quantity in driving the agb evolution @xcite .",
    "models with mass above @xmath55 experience hbb , consisting of an advanced proton capture nucleosynthesis at the bottom of the convective envelope @xcite .",
    "this nuclear activity requires that the temperature at the base of the external mantle ( @xmath56 ) exceeds @xmath57 mk .",

    "hbb affects the overall duration of the tp ",
    "agb phase , because the higher luminosity favours a faster loss of the external mantle @xcite . on the chemical side ,",
    "the ignition of hbb triggers the activation of cn cycling , with the synthesis of nitrogen at the expense of carbon ; this process requires temperatures @xmath58 mk .",
    "stars of mass above @xmath59 evolve at @xmath60 mk , thus experiencing an even more advanced nucleosynthesis , with the activation of the full cno cycle .",
    "the surface chemical composition of these stars will be carbon and oxygen poor , and enriched in nitrogen .",
    "the achievement of the c  star stage in the stars undergoing hbb is prevented by the proton capture nucleosynthesis at which carbon nuclei are exposed in the external envelope .",
    "stars of initial mass below @xmath61 do not experience any hbb ; their surface chemical composition is altered only by the third dredge up ( tdu ) phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the tdu is characterised by the inward penetration of the base of the convective envelope following each tp ; the external mantle may thus reach internal layers undergoing @xmath62 nucleosynthesis and greatly enriched in carbon .",
    "oxygen is also expected to be enhanced in this region of the star , though at a smaller extent than carbon .",
    "owing to repeated tdu events , which eventually lead to the @xmath63 condition , the stars with mass in the range @xmath64 become c  stars .",
    "the upper limit of this mass interval is determined by the achievement of hbb conditions , whereas stars of mass below @xmath65 loose the external mantle before becoming c  stars .",
    "the surface carbon enrichment increases with the mass of the star , because models of higher mass experience more tps ( thus , more tdu events ) before the envelope is entirely lost .",
    "note that the upper limit in mass for the achievement of the c  star stage is dependent on the convection modelling .",
    "the @xmath66value given above is found when the fst description is adopted .",
    "other investigators , using the mlt approach @xcite find a wider range in mass for carbon stars .",
    "unfortunately , the present study can not be used to discriminate among the different descriptions , because the relative number of @xmath44 c - stars expected ( see section [ interpretation ] and fig . [ isto_mass ] ) , if any , is significantly smaller than lower - mass counterparts to allow any statistics of the distribution of stars along the c - star sequence .",
    "the metallicity of the stars has a significant impact on the results obtained ; this is because the efficiency of the mechanisms potentially able to alter the surface chemical composition , namely tdu and hbb , changes with the metallicity .",
    "an additional reason is that the core mass vs. initial mass relationship becomes steeper when the metallicity decreases ) domain , the differences are due to the higher efficiency of the h - burning shell in lower metallicity stars , when evolving along the rgb ; this makes the core to grow faster , thus to higher core mass in the following phases . for @xmath67 models ,",
    "the core masses of lower metallicity stars are larger , because they experience a more penetrating second dredge - up . ] .    on the physical side , because lower metallicity stars evolve on more massive cores , the upper limit ( in mass ) of the stars experiencing the agb evolution and thus avoiding core collapse , changes from @xmath68 for @xmath2 stars to @xmath69 for @xmath40 .",
    "the lower limit for the ignition of hbb also increases with z : it changes from @xmath70 in the @xmath2 case to @xmath71 for @xmath40 .",
    "the surface chemistry of the stars experiencing hbb is significantly affected by the metallicity because lower  z stars are exposed to a more advanced nucleosynthesis at the base of the envelope .",
    "this particularly affects the oxygen content , which is destroyed more easily in lower metallicity models ( e.g. , see fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the low",
    " mass star domain the main effect of metallicity is on the lowest mass of the stars eventually reaching the c  star stage : in the @xmath2 case all stars of mass above @xmath65 become c  stars , whereas for @xmath40 this lower limit is @xmath72 .",
    "the reason for this trend with metallicity is twofold : a ) stars of lower z achieve more easily the c  star stage , because the initial oxygen is smaller ; b ) the efficiency of tdu is higher in models of lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "the winds of agb stars prove an extremely favourable environment to dust formation , because they are extremely cool and sufficiently dense to allow condensation of a large number of gas molecules into dust @xcite .    the dust production by the agb models used in the present analysis",
    "are extensively discussed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "an overall view of the results for various masses and metallicities is presented in @xcite . here",
    "we provide a short summary of the main findings of those works , most relevant for the present investigation .",
    "the threshold mass of @xmath73 for the activation of hbb also plays an important role in the type of dust produced : this is because the dust formed depends on the atmospheric c / o ratio , with carbon - rich stars producing carbonaceous dust ( @xmath74 ) and oxygen  rich agb stars ( @xmath43 ) forming silicates and alumina dust @xcite .    in the latter case ,",
    "the amount of silicates and alumina dust formed is approximately proportional to the metallicity , because the abundance of silicon and aluminium scales almost linearly with z. the same holds for the sic formed in the lower mass counterparts , which is also dependent on the silicon available in the envelope .",
    "conversely , the solid carbon formed is at first approximation independent of z , because the carbon transported to the surface via tdu is formed in situ .    in the higher mass domain , the quantity of dust formed increases with the initial mass of the star , because the density of the wind generally increases with mass , at least for the stars experiencing hbb . in lower mass stars",
    "the amount of carbon dust formed increases with the initial mass , as the carbon accumulated to the surface is larger in higher mass models ( see fig .",
    "9 and  10 in * ? ? ?",
    "the degree of obscuration of agb stars depends on the type and quantity of dust formed in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "dust particles reprocess the radiation emitted by the central star to the ir , thus shifting the peak of the spectral energy distribution to longer wavelengths .    in stars experiencing hbb , the degree of obscuration increases during the initial part of the tp  agb evolution , because the growth of the core mass leads to stronger hbb conditions , higher mass  loss rates , and higher density winds , resulting in higher rates of silicate and alumina dust grain growth ( see fig .  2 in * ?",
    "* ) . the largest optical depths ( of order unity )",
    "are reached in conjunction with the phase when hbb is strongest , before the gradual loss of the envelope provokes a general cooling of the whole external region of the star .",

    "agb evolution with scarce amount of dust in their wind ; the fraction of tp  agb life during which they are obscured is below @xmath77 .",
    "the metallicity trend is therefore straightforward : because higher  z , massive tp ",
    "agb stars produce more dust , the fraction of the tp  agb life when the stars are obscured is larger in higher  z objects .",
    "stars of mass below @xmath71 evolve initially with no dust , as formation of silicates in the phases previous to the achievement of the c  star phase is negligible .",

    "this phase is longer at lower metallicity , where the @xmath63 condition is reached more easily ( see fig .  2 in * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite identified a unique class of progenitors for stars in the reddest side of the c  star sequence , but here we find a miscellaneous distribution of masses and chemical compositions .",
    "the reason for this is that the sfh of ic 1613 is rather constant @xcite , whereas the sfh of the mcs present peaks of intense star formation @xcite , during which the formation of the stars currently populating the red side of the c  star sequence occurred @xcite .    in the analysis of the c  stars populating the reddest regions of the cmd , we note that objects with @xmath2 that have the reddest @xmath80 $ ] colours are those evolving through the very final tp  agb phase , when the envelope is about to be entirely lost .",

    "<S> we used models of thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , that also describe the dust - formation process in the wind , to interpret the combination of near and mid  infrared photometric data of the dwarf galaxy ic 1613 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that this approach is extended to an environment different from the milky way and the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis , based on synthetic population techniques , shows a nice agreement between the observations and the expected distribution of stars in the colour  magnitude diagrams obtained with @xmath0 and _ spitzer _ bands . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a characterization of the individual stars in the agb sample in terms of mass , chemical composition , and formation epoch of the progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the stars exhibiting the largest degree of obscuration as carbon stars evolving through the final agb phases , descending from @xmath1 objects of metallicity @xmath2 and from @xmath3 stars with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen  </S>",
    "<S> rich stars constitute the majority of the sample ( @xmath5 , mainly low mass stars ( @xmath6 ) that produce a negligible amount of dust ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the overall dust - production rate from ic 1613 , mostly determined by carbon stars , to be @xmath8 with an uncertainty of 30% . </S>",
    "<S> the capability of the current generation of models to interpret the agb population in an environment different from the mcs opens the possibility to extend this kind of analysis to other local group galaxies .    </S>",
