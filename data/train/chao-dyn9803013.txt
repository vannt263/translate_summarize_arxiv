    "first principle bases of phenomenologies of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics are due , respectively , to chapman - enskog@xcite,@xcite and prigogine@xcite , who showed the validity of navier - stokes equation and the equality expression of the second law of thermodynamics on common basis of the boltzmann equation expanded to the first order deviation from equilibrium .",
    "it was , however , an open question whether these equations still hold for turbulent flows where the dependent variables are stochastic and fractal , therefore not differentiable@xcite .",
    "this problem was solved@xcite using the microscopic density@xcite , namely , unaveraged boltzmann function , leading to rederivation of the navier - stokes equation written in terms of instantaneous quantities without assuming any statistical concepts like local equilibrium , or first order deviation form it .",
    "thus the equations currently employed for the direct numerical simulation(dns ) has acquired the first principle basis .",
    "then a question will arise as to whether the alternative methodology of computational fluid dynamics , namely , reynolds - average formalism can be founded on first principles as well .",
    "in contrast with dns founded on the microscopic density(the klimontovich formalism ) its reynolds - average counterpart should be based on its averaged version , namely , the boltzmann function .",
    "structure of this _ boltzmann formalism _",
    ", so to say , is shown to be identical with what is called the bbgky hierarchy theory of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "each of the two formalisms has advantages as well as disadvantages from computational viewpoints .",
    "the most serious disadvantage of the k - formalism lies in the fact that it deals with fractal quantities which are selfsimilarly rugged to a length scale as small as the kolmogorov scale@xcite .",
    "it means that if the 3-d navier - stokes equation is to be solved by a finite difference method , the grid size be smaller than this length , namely of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ; reynolds number ) .",
    "it requires the computer memory size growing with @xmath2(the small eddy difficulty ) . for this reason ,",
    "the consensus upper limit of applicability of the current dns falls short of @xmath3 . to be able to apply the dns for practical design of transport vehicles(@xmath4 ) we would have to have a computer with memory size greater by the factor of @xmath5 compared to the currently available ones",
    "this situation is not changed even when one employs spectral methods to avoid the conceptual difficulty of having to work with differential equations . for , then , the number of the fourier modes to be taken into account increases at the same rate .",
    "the b - formalism , in contrast , is free from such difficulty owing to the statistical average taken in the process of generating distribution functions at the expense of dealing with multitude of such functions , infinite in number .",
    "the statistical average as meant here is either an ensemble average over repeated experiments , or an average over time that is long enough for the fractal ruggedness to be smoothed out , yet is short enough for fluid - dynamic unsteadiness , such as shedding period of krmn vortices or aerodynamic flutter to be discernible .",
    "the ergodic theorem warrants their identity .",
    "the objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the reynolds average regime of the computational fluid dynamics can be founded on a firm first principle ground through the following processes :    * demonstration of how a closed set of kinetic equations is obtained out of an infinite chain of them of the b - formalism . *",
    "taking fluid moments of the kinetic equation for two - point fluctuation - correlations that is unique from the viewpoint of first principles .",
    "* rederivation of the whole set of equations thus obtained from phenomenological equations being used for dns , namely , eliminating the process via statistical mechanics .",
    "any statistical theory rests on the axiom that a field quantity @xmath6 describing stochastic and possibly fractal physical phenomenon is equivalent to a set of quantities that are smooth , deterministic , and infinite in number , @xmath7 where overbar stands for the statistical average as defined in the preceding section , and @xmath8 is the same quantity at a different point @xmath9 .",
    "the klimontovich formalism as defined here is a formalism where @xmath10 is identified with the microscopic density @xcite @xmath11 in this expression @xmath12 is a point in the phase(@xmath13- ) space , @xmath14 is the locus of @xmath15-th molecule in this space , @xmath16 is the total number of molecules under consideration , and @xmath17 denotes the six - dimensional delta function .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the equation governing @xmath10 is the _ unaveraged _ boltzmann equation ; @xmath18 \\equiv ( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}+    { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$ } } } \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}})\\underline{f } -    j(z|\\widehat{z})[\\underline{f } \\",
    "\\underline{\\hat{f } } ] = 0\\ ] ] with @xmath19 denoting the classical collision integral acting on molecule @xmath9 .",
    "the key issue here is that eq.([eq3 ] ) is a _ deterministic _ equation of continuity in the @xmath13-space , free from any statistical concepts@xcite .    the boltzmann formalism , on the other hand , deals with quantities to have appeared on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "subject to statistical average , namely , the boltzmann function @xmath20 and the correlation functions of consecutive hierarchies @xmath21 klimontovich variables @xcite such as instantaneous gas density @xmath22 and center - of - mass velocity @xmath23 of the @xmath16-particle system are given by @xmath24 @xmath25 the reynolds - averaged version of those fluid variables are generated by taking average of expressions ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) @xmath26 @xmath27 two - point correlation @xmath28 consists of two parts ; short - range part due to direct molecular collisions that is irrelevant to turbulence and long - range part attributable to turbulence correlations .",
    "the latter part is expanded in a double series of hermite polynomials@xcite where all the turbulent transport terms including reynolds stress appear as expansion coefficients .",
    "a set of equations governing those quantities standing on the l.h.s . of ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "is generated from eq.([eq3 ] ) by taking moments and averaging .",
    "this procedure is not unique ; in general there are infinite ways of constructing such moment equations .",
    "this arbitrariness is eliminated by invoking a postulate that _ the whole system be consistent with liouville s equation_(the equation of continuity of @xmath16-particle probability density in 6@xmath16-dimensional space ; the _ master _ equation that is universally valid ) , or its corollary that _ the whole set of equations be identical with those of the bbgky theory at each level of hierarchies_. the only difference is that the _ bbgky _ generates destribution functions in the direction of descending number of molecules through a series of integrations starting from @xmath29 , whereas here are defined the same functions in ascending number of molecules .",
    "the kinematical information missing in the latter approach is identical in analogy with the fact that we can not predict the functional form of @xmath30 out of @xmath31 .",

    "the issue that is most crucial to the quality of the proposed approach is the closure condition .",
    "it is how to truncate the infinite chain of equations to make the system tractable without violating physical soundness .",
    "early stage of development along this line has employed the following condition of _ tertiary chaos _",
    "@xcite , @xcite @xmath37 a condition next to the simplest one known as boltzmann s ( binary ) molecular chaos hypothesis ; @xmath38 .",
    "eq.([eq12 ] ) under this closure condition is investigeted in some depth : it is shown that assumption ( [ eq14 ] ) allows eq.([eq12 ] ) for separating variables into those for respective particles , thereby its fluid moment equation leads to linearized navier - stokes equation ( the orr - sommerfeld equation , in particular . ) .",
    "it is also seen that this closure gives satisfactory description only for weak turbulence where the nonlinearity in turbulent intensity does not play major roles .",
    "later , it has been superseded by alternative one that has wider range of applicability , yet preserving the variable - separability beyond linear regime @xcite : namely , put @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the variable - separation parameter having the dimension of the frequency , @xmath42 is a characteristic time , symbols(@xmath43 ) and r.p .",
    "denote the complex conjugate and the real part , respectively .",
    "separated variable @xmath44 is complex , subject to @xmath45 as will be justified a posteriori.(see eq.([eq22 ] ) below . )",
    "the closure condition is introduced in the following form @xmath46 it makes eq.([eq12 ] ) separated into two equations each for respective points @xmath47 and @xmath9 , in the form of complex conjugate to each other provided that condition ( [ eq20 ] ) is met : @xmath48 = 0\\ ] ] if the nonlinear term of convolutional integral is deleted , the equation degenerates to the previous case with tertiary chaos closure .",
    "fluid moments of ( [ eq22 ] ) together with ( [ eq18 ] ) provide equations for turbulent transports such as reynolds stress and turbulent heat flux density to obey . for actual derivation of these equations see @xcite .",
    "the approach described in the previous section has shed some lights in turbulence research .",
    "in fact , for the cases tested agreement with experiments is satisfactory although the theory is free from any adjustable parameters@xcite as contrast with existing models such as eddy - viscosity model .",
    "the success , however , has been limited to cases where the flow geometry is governed by single variable.(note that the velocity fluctuations are multi - dimensional . )",
    "we will show that a small renovation of the theory sketched in the preceeding section can make turbulence with general three - dimensional geometry tractable .",
    "it is to replace the frequency @xmath41 , a scaler quantity having appeared in eqs.([eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) , by the wave number that is a vector connected to the frequency through phase velocity by the dispersion formula    @xmath49    then , new separation rule to replace ( [ eq18 ] ) is    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the characteristic length of the macroscopic phenomenon under consideration . accordingly",

    "owing to the fortuitous situation that the only nonlinear term in eq.([eq25 ] ) has the form of convolutional integral , the factor @xmath55 is seen to drop off upon substituting expression ( [ eq26 ] ) into eq.([eq25 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath56 the equation for @xmath54 should preserve the form of eq.([eq25 ] ) with the only substitution    @xmath57    another favorable property of the nonlinear integral is that it reduces to a simple product through fourier transform    @xmath58    such that    @xmath59    then eq .",

    "therefore @xmath63 might well be called the eddy variable .    substituting ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq28 ] ) into ( [ eq24 ] ) we have a remarkably simple formula for @xmath64 when written in terms of @xmath65 ,    @xmath66    note that here all the quantities of the integrand are real in contrast with those of ( [ eq24 ] )",
    ".    derivation of fluid equations from eq.([eq30 ] ) is almost parallel to its low dimensional predecessor@xcite , so will not be repeated here .",
    "minimum necessary steps to reach the final form of fluid equations will be given in order : first we employ the same fluid - moment expansion for f(@xmath67 ) in terms of hermite s polynomial @xmath68 in the @xmath69-space after grad @xcite ;    @xmath70\\\\          \\mbox{with}\\\\       { \\cal h } & = { \\cal h } ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\xi$ } } } ) \\\\        { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\xi$ } } } & = { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$w$}}}/a = ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$ } } } - { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$u$}}}^{\\dagger})/a\\\\        u\\sp{\\dagger}\\sb{j } & \\equiv m_j / \\rho\\\\        m_j & \\equiv \\rho u_j + \\overline{\\rho ' u_j'}\\\\        a^2 & \\equiv r_m t \\quad ( r_m \\equiv \\mbox{avogadro no./molecular          no.})\\\\       \\end{array }    \\right\\}\\ ] ]    note that this expansion differs from the classical 13-moment expansion in that @xmath71 .",
    "second , we replace eq.([eq30 ] ) by its moment equivalents @xmath72d{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$ } } } = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is substituted by ( [ eq33 ] ) and @xmath73 stands for one of the 13 moment functions ; 1,@xmath74,@xmath75,@xmath76,@xmath77 .",
    "these choices of moments correspond to equations of fluctuations of continuity , momentum , energy , stress tensor @xmath78 and heat flux density vector @xmath79 , respectively .",

    "it is readily seen that eqs.([eq35 ] ) are exactly the same as those derived in ref.@xcite[eqs.([eq25] ) through ( [ eq28] ) ] if the following replacements are effected ,    @xmath85    @xmath86    the set of eqs.([eq35 ] ) describes evolution of five quantities @xmath87 subject to homogeneous boundary conditions that all @xmath88 s vanish with @xmath89 , on the solid surface , and wherever turbulent intensity is zero in the physical space .",
    "therefore , the expected solution for those quantities must have the form of a solitary wave ( not to be confused with a soliton ) .",
    "eqs.([eq35 ] ) are equations governing compressible turbulence . for incompressible flows @xmath90 the energy fluctuation equation is decoupled , and a closed set of equations that results is    @xmath91    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath61 and @xmath94 have been defined by ( [ eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq35 ] ) , respectively .",
    "it is readily seen that these equations represent the equation of continuity and the navier - stokes equation generalized to 6d space @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , if we suppress the eddy variables@xmath96 this set degenerates to the usual navier - stokes equation for velocity @xmath97 and pressure @xmath98 .",
    "if further , nonlinear terms are neglected in eq.([eq40 ] ) and parallel flow@xmath99 is assumed , they reduce to the orr - sommerfeld equation to govern @xmath100 as it should .",
    "it should be remarked that variables @xmath88 s do not correspond to any turbulent fluctuations that are tangible to macroscopic sensors.they are shown to be related to fluctuation correlations of turbulent quantities through the following deduction : from ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) we have expression for instantaneous density fluctuation that is an observable ;    @xmath101    similarly , by subtracting ( [ eq8 ] ) from ( [ eq10 ] ) , we have @xmath102 this expression , upon substituting ( [ eq41 ] ) for @xmath103 , reduces to @xmath104 with @xmath105 from which we have , utilizing definition ( [ eq6 ] ) for @xmath64 and neglecting terms of @xmath106    @xmath107    furthermore , by substituting ( [ eq32 ] ) for @xmath64 and then ( [ eq33 ] ) for @xmath65 , and carrying out integration over(@xmath108 ) with orthonormal property of the hermite polynomials incorporated , the following relationship results ;    @xmath109    turbulent intensity or reynolds stress is then given by putting @xmath110 ;    @xmath111    a relationship expressing the observable turbulence intensities by an integral operation of the wave function .",
    "it is through this relationship that the reynolds averaged navier - stokes equation is coupled with eqs.([eq35 ] ) that govern @xmath88 s standing on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq45 ] ) .    in a similar fashion",
    "the wave function representing temperature fluctuation @xmath112 can be derived as follows : since the ideal gas law @xmath113 holds for instantaneous variables @xcite , we have @xmath114 accordingly , from ( [ eq32 ] ) @xmath115 where we have employed hermite expansion ( [ eq33 ] ) .",
    "thus we see that @xmath116 is the wave function to be responsible for the temperature fluctuation @xmath117 .",

    "once the correspondence rule ( [ eq46 ] ) has been established we are able to reconstruct eq.([eq35 ] ) using phenomenologies alone.this is what is anticipated because the present ( boltzmann ) formalism is the averaged version of the klimontovich formalism describing @xmath119 directly , where the identity of phenomenologies and first - principle approach is warranted @xcite .",
    "to effect this we shall base on the assertion that turbulent compressible flow of inert gas is governed by the following set of equations :    @xmath127    @xmath128=0\\ ] ]    @xmath129=0\\ ] ]    where @xmath130    @xmath131    \\end{array } \\right\\}\\ ] ]    @xmath132-     \\frac{2}{3 } \\delta_{jr }     \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k }     \\left(\\frac{\\underline{m}_k}{\\underline{\\rho}}\\right)\\\\ \\vspace{-3mm}\\\\    \\left(\\underline{q}_r\\right)_{f}&= & \\displaystyle    -\\frac{\\underline{\\lambda}}{r_m }    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_r }    \\left(\\frac{\\underline{p}}{\\underline{\\rho}}\\right ) \\end{array}\\right\\}\\ ] ]    denote , respectively , the mass flux density , the internal energy and the enthalpy per unit of volume ( the lower case letter refers to _ specific _ quantities ) , the navier - stokes law for stress tensor and the fourier s law for the heat flux density .",

    "the following simple example would help extract what is meant by this trivial - looking warning : let a steady - state temperature distribution of a three - dimensional body , say , a column with rectangular cross - section in the @xmath186-@xmath187 plane be asked , but the information only on the diagonal plane @xmath188 is required .",
    "needless to say that proper process is to work with 3-d laplace equation for the solution @xmath189 , and put @xmath190 to have @xmath191 .",

    "majority of turbulence models currently prevailing do _ not _ concur , in the simplest case of the homogeneous and isotropic turbulence , with the krmn - howarth theory as a consequence of the hasty reduction in independent variables as sketched here .",
    "summarizing , the proposed approach shares the common basis with @xmath183 models only at the lowest level of description , namely , the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes equation , but differs substantially at next level of the reynolds stress equation .",
    "on the basis of the boltzmann formalism , namely , nonequilibrium statistical mechanics designed for turbulence , two sets of equations are derived to comprise a closed set .",
    "the one is the group of equations governing reynolds - averaged fluid quantities , and the other is the variable - separated version of the fluctuation - correlation equations that reduces to the classical krmn - howarth equation in the homogeneous and isotropic limit .",
    "the two sets of equations are coupled through turbulent transports such as reynolds stress and turbulent heat - flux density .",
    "the key role of the first principle lies in that + ( i )  for the reynolds averaged equations , it gives a firmer basis than via phenomenologies , whereas , + ( ii )  for the turbulent - transport equations , it reveals a hidden kinematical prerequisite for any turbulence governing equations to fulfill , thereby enabling to single out the unique form .",
    "it is also shown that once their unique form has been established the whole sets of equations are able to be reconstructed a posteriori using phenomenologies alone .",
    "the latter set of equations is converted into a variable - separated form , leading to those governing solitary - wave function through which all the turbulent - transport properties are calculated .",
    "the equations are solved for a self - similar turbulent mixing layer , leading to a solitary - wave type solution in the physical - plus - eddy space .",
    "reynolds stress is obtained through a simple integration of the solution over the eddy space in a form free from any empirical parameters , yet showing satisfactory agreement with existing experiment .",

    "<S> a unique form of turbulent - transport equations is derived based on first principles.the role of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics employed to describe the phenomenology is that it enables to single out the unique form consistent with master equation of liouville , a prerequisite not met with existing equations for turbulence modeling.the equation is variable - separated to yield a navier - stokes equation in 6d(physical - plus - eddy ) space with homogeneous boundary conditions.turbulent transports such as reynolds stress are calculated using a solution of this equation ; a solitary - wave function.satisfactory agreement is observed with existing experiment for mixing shear layer of incompressible flows although no empirical constants to fit with data are involved . </S>"
