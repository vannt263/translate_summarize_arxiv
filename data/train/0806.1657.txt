    "dwarf novae are believed to be unmagnetized close binary systems containing white dwarf primary and low mass main sequence secondary .",
    "the secondary fills its roche lobe and looses the material through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "this matter forms an accretion disc around the white dwarf .",
    "one of the most intriguing classes of dwarf novae are su uma stars which have short orbital periods ( less than 2.5 hours ) and show two types of outbursts : normal outbursts and superoutbursts .",
    "superoutbursts are typically about one magnitude brighter than normal outbursts , occur about ten times less frequently and display characteristic tooth - shape light modulations i.e. so called superhumps ( see warner 1995 for review ) .",
    "the behavior of su uma stars in now quite well understood within the frame of the thermal - tidal instability model ( see osaki 1996 for review ) .",
    "superhumps occur at a period slightly longer than the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "they are most probably the result of accretion disk precession caused by gravitational perturbations from the secondary",
    ". these perturbations are most effective when disk particles moving in eccentric orbits enter the 3:1 resonance .",
    "then the superhump period is simply the beat period between orbital and precession rate periods .",
    "although in the last decades significant progress has been made in explaining the behaviour of dwarf novae light curves , some physical processes ongoing in these systems are still not fully understood ( see for example smak 2000 , schreiber and lasota 2007 ) .    in the beginning of 90ties of xx century ,",
    "su uma stars were believed to be quite uniform group of variables with common properties .",
    "these objects went into superoutburst every year or so and between two successive superoutbursts showed @xmath410 ordinary outbursts .",
    "however , there were some exceptions like wz sge , which show infrequent and large amplitude superoutburst followed by the period of quiescence with no single eruption lasting even 30 years .    in 1995 astronomical community",
    "was alerted about the presence of stars characterized by complete opposite behavior .",
    "first , misslet and shafter ( 1995 ) reported observations of pg 0943 + 521 ( later called er uma ) , which allowed to detect superhumps with period of 0.0656 days and include this object into the su uma group of variables .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the long term light curve of er uma was very short interval between two successive superoutbursts ( so called supercycle ) reaching only 44 days .",
    "this value was about three times shorter than shortest previously known supercycles .",
    "this work was quickly followed by paper of robertson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who confirmed all findings of misslet and shafter ( 1995 ) and precisely determined the value of supercycle of er uma to be equal to 42.95 days .",
    "moreover , they found two more objects with similar properies - v1159 ori with supercycle of 44.5 days and rz lmi with supercycle as short as 18.87 days ! in the same year nogami et al .",
    "( 1995 ) published paper which confirmed extremely short supercycle of rz lmi and showing that it belongs to su uma variables exhibiting clear superhumps with period of 0.05946 days .",
    "one year later the number of these unusual variables increased to four objects .",
    "kato et al . ( 1996 ) reported the discovery that di uma has a supercycle of 25 days and shows clear superhumps with period of 0.0555 days .",
    "the fifth er uma - type variable - ix dra - was discovered by ishioka et al .",
    "their observations revealed a supercycle length of 53 days and an interval between normal outbursts of 3 - 4 days .",
    "olech et al .",
    "( 2004 ) determined precisely both superhump and orbital periods of the binary and estimated the supercycle length to 54 days .",
    "the basic properies of five known up - today members of er uma group are summarized in table 1 .",

    "however , the period excess @xmath6 defined as @xmath12 , which is connected with mass ratio by the following relation :    @xmath13    suggests different evolutionary status of the particular members of er uma stars .",
    "for example , er uma and v1159 ori seem to have normal secondaries and evolve towards the shorter orbital periods . on the other hand , di uma and ix dra",
    "are much more evolved objects with sub - stellar secondaries ( possibly degenerate brown dwarfs ) and evolve towards the longer orbital periods ( patterson 2001 , olech et al .",
    "the question why di uma and ix dra are so active , while wz sge stars having similar period excesses have longest supercycles , is still open .",
    "the variability of rz lmi was discovered by lipovetskij and stepanjan ( 1981 ) .",
    "spectra obtained by green et al .",
    "( 1982 ) suggested that the star is dwarf nova with broad hydrogen and helium emission lines and with clear variability in @xmath14 filter in the range from 16.8 to 14.4 mag .",
    "another spectrum obtained by szkody and howell ( 1992 ) showed h@xmath15 and h@xmath16 absorption features and h@xmath17 absorption with emission core , which indicated the presence of an accretion disk at high mass - transfer rate .",
    "rz lmi was also included as a cataclysmic variable candidate in palomar - green survey ( green et al .",
    "1986 ) and designated as pg 0948 + 344 .",
    "long term ccd photometry spanning over 2.5 years of almost continuous observations was presented by robertson et al .",
    "the light curve in @xmath0 was characterized by long eruptions repeating quite regularly every 18.87 days and short eruptions occurring every 3.8 days .",

    "the extreme properties of rz lmi , its relatively high brightness , lack of precise photometry in minimum light , unknown orbital period and determination of the superhump period basing on the data from only one superoutburst encouraged us to include this object into the list of variables regularly monitored within the curious variables experiment ( olech et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) .",
    ".journal of the ccd observations of rz lmi .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > \" , ]      in the light curve of rz lmi from all superoutbursts we detected 70 maxima of superhumps .",
    "their times are listed in table 4 together with the errors , cycle number @xmath19 and @xmath20 values computed according to the ephemeris which will be described further .",
    "the @xmath20 values from first three superoutbursts shows no signs of significant trend indicating that the period of superhumps was roughly constant .",
    "there are observational evidences that er uma stars shows ordinary superhumps also in quiescence indicating that in these systems the disk is elliptical and tidally unstable all the time .",
    "it might suggest that the star should remember the phase of the superhumps from one superoutburst to another .",
    "the @xmath20 data from our superoutbursts number i , ii and iii seem to confirm this hypothesis . they can be fitted with common linear ephemeris in the form :",
    "@xmath21    the corresponding @xmath20 diagram is shown in fig .",
    "moreover , the detrended light curve containing superhumps from all superoutbursts might be phased with one period and shows no traces of phase shifts between superhumps from different superoutburst .",
    "such a light curve is plotted in fig . 10 .",
    "something strange happened to rz lmi during superoutburst number iv .",
    "we detected then a clear eruption , which has properies of superoutburst i.e. is brighter that ordinary outburst and shows decline typical for plateau phase but during two nights of this bright state we have not detected any superhumps .",
    "the superoutburst no .",
    "v occurred in right time but with slightly different behaviour of superhumps .",
    "their maxima can be fitted with following linear ephemeris :    @xmath22    but from the @xmath20 values computed according to this ephemeris and shown in table 4 and in fig .",
    "11 it is evident that the period of superhumps was quickly increasing .",
    "thus the moments of maxima can be fitted with the following parabola :    @xmath23    indicating that the period was increasing with the rate of @xmath24 .",
    "such a period derivative is typical for su uma stars with superhump periods of around 0.06 days ( for example see fig . 5 in rutkowski et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "there are insufficient number of data to investigate possible period changes during superoutburst no .",
    "vi , thus the corresponding moments of maxima were fitted only with the linear ephemeris :    @xmath25    there was only one superoutburst with sufficient amount of data for @xmath20 analysis in 2005 season .",
    "it was superoutburst no .",
    "xxiv and its maxima can be fitted with the following linear ephemeris :    @xmath26    however , the data collected in table 4 and shown in fig",
    ". 12 might suggest slight increasing trend with rate of @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "the error of this determination is large , and within @xmath28 it is consistent with constant value of period .",
    "as we wrote earlier rz lmi is so active that it is difficult to find it in quiescence .",
    "however , on three occasions , we collected sufficient amount of data to make the analysis of behaviour of the star in minimum light and in ordinary outbursts .",
    "the first interval of data comes from 2004 , mar 17 - 22 when we observed rz lmi on four nights of minimum light and one night of the normal outburst .",
    "sample light curves from these period are shown in fig .",
    "13 and display clear and periodic light variations of amplitude around 0.3 - 0.4 mag .",
    "taking into account that these data were collected just after the final decline of superoutburst no .",
    "iii , one can suspect that we observe so called late superhumps - the phenomenon occurring at the end of superoutburst with period roughly equal to period of ordinary superhumps but with phase shift reaching up to 0.5 cycle .",
    "@xmath20 diagram from fig .",
    "9 shows the moments of the maxima observed on 2004 mar 17 as black dots suggesting that they are shifted in phase by about 0.3 cycle i.e. significantly less than typical value of 0.5 cycle .    to find a period of these variations",
    ", we first transformed our light curves to the intensity units , next we detrended them removing long scale behaviour .",
    "the resulting anova periodogram is shown in upper panel of fig .",
    "the highest peak occurs at frequency @xmath29 c / d corresponding to the period of 0.05960(7 ) days .",
    "this is only 0.3% longer than mean superhump period and the two periods differ by the value which is about three times larger that the error of the period determination .",
    "it is also possible that true value of frequency appears as 1-day alias at @xmath30 c / d corresponding to the period of 0.05625(7 ) days which is significantly shorter than superhump period and might be also shorter than unknown orbital period of the system . in this case",
    "this period might be assumed as period of negative superhumps .",
    "however , it is known that negative superhump , orbital and positive superhump periods correlate with each other ( retter et al .",
    "2002 , olech et al .",
    "this correlation indicates that the orbital period should be around 0.0574 days and superhump period excess @xmath6 should be as large as 3.5% i.e. about three times too high for star with such a superhump period .",
    "thus the final conclusion is that in quiescence rz lmi showed modulations with period roughly equal to superhump period and indicating that in this interval the disc could be still eccentric and precessing .",
    "two other long intervals when the star was observed in quiescence occurred on 2005 , feb 07 - 11 and 2005 , mar 19 - apr 06 . from two lower periodograms shown in fig .",
    "14 it is clear that no periodic modulations were observed at that time .",
    "from our table 1 summarizing main properies of er uma stars , it is clear that these objects have many common properties but may be divided into two subgroups probably with different evolutionary status .",
    "15 , repeated after patterson ( 1998 , 2001 ) and olech et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , shows correlation between period excess ( i.e. mass ratio ) and orbital period of the system .",
    "the solid line shows the evolutionary track of a dwarf nova with a white dwarf of mass 0.75 @xmath31 and secondary component with effective radius 6% larger than that of single main sequence star .",
    "the nova evolves towards the shorter periods first due to the magnetic braking , next due to the emission of gravitational waves . after reaching the period minimum ,",
    "the secondary becomes degenerate brown dwarf and system starts to increase its orbital period .",
    "it seems that di uma and ix dra ( both belonging to er uma stars ) are such evolved period bouncers , which in fact should be similar to old and inactive wz sge stars ( wz sge , al com and eg cnc showed in the plot ) . on the other hand ,",
    "er uma and v1159 ori , shown as filled triangles , seem to be much younger objects still evolving towards shorter periods .    where is the place of rz lmi ?",
    "it is difficult to answer this question without knowledge about the orbital period of the system .",
    "our photometric data showed no other short term modulations than these corresponding to the ordinary superhumps .",
    "it would be very tempting to make the spectroscopic observations of the star in quiescence . with minimum brightness of 16.5 mag",
    "it can be done with 2 - 3-meter class telescope .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of the global light curve of rz lmi made by robertson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and based on almost three years observing period showed that supercycle of rz lmi is not stable .",
    "their @xmath20 diagram for supermaxima was characterized by clear decreasing trend with @xmath32 .",
    "however graph shows also occasional jumps where particular superoutburst occur even 5 days before or after the predicted moment .",
    "if this decreasing trend would continue to the epoch of our observations the supercycle should be then around 18.5 days , which is in disagreement with determined value of 19.07 days .",
    "our global light curve spans only two seasons and has no enough data to construct reliable @xmath20 diagram for supermaxima . however , quick look at fig .",
    "1 , could draw some valuable conclusions . in 2004",
    "the 19-day periodicity is preserved through all superoutbursts except eruption number iv . in this case , we , in fact , are not certain whether we deal with superoutburst which occurred slightly before predicted moment or exceptionaly bright normal outburst lasting longer than usual .",
    "vicinity of eruption number iv is also the time when disk could loose its eccentricity , expel the matter via this long outburst and rebuilt eccentricity again in superoutburst no .",
    "v.    data from 2005 seem to confirm stability of 19-day supercycle .",
    "the superoutburst no .",
    "xxiv , which has the best observational coverage , occurs at right time according to 19-day ephemeris .",
    "the problem is with superoutburst no .",
    "xxiii , where instead of supermaximum we noted two ordinary outbursts .",
    "our light curve , however , does not exclude possibility that supermaximum occurred a few days earlier according to the ephemeris .",
    "mass transfer from the secondary to the disk , building the eccentricity , ignition of the outbursts and superoutbursts due to the thermal and tidal instabilities are stochastic processes , which are far for regularity .",
    "the question is why rz lmi is so regular ?",
    "even if we observe some shifts in time of the start of particular supermaximum , the clock returns to stability without shift of the phase of whole pattern .",
    "this is hard to explain from the point of view of standard thermal - tidal instability model and might need some help from , for example , external force .",
    "the present number of known su uma systems reached the level for which the statistics tells us that some of these close binaries might be orbited by a third body .",
    "is this in case of rz lmi ?",
    "we do not know .",
    "but the hypothesis that 19-day period is the orbital period of the third body ( or some kind resonant value ) and cause of both the stability of supercycle and high activity of the star , which without this body would be quiet wz sge object , is tempting .",
    "the standard thermal - tidal instability model is unable to produce supercycles shorter that 40 days .",
    "activity of the ordinary su uma variable can be increased by increasing a mass transfer rate .",
    "but when it reaches @xmath33 g / s the supercycle starts to lenghten again due to the fact that superoutburst lasts longer .",
    "further increasing of mass transfer causes transition of the star to the group of permanent superhumpers which are in permanent state of supermaximum and show infinite value of supercycle .",
    "osaki ( 1995 ) tried to explain properties of rz lmi by artificial ending the superoutburst at the moment , when the disk had shrunk from @xmath34 to only @xmath35 , whereas a typical value used for ordinary su uma stars is @xmath36 .",
    "hellier ( 2001 ) suggested that the source of the premature end of superoutburst might be a cooling wave propagating from the region outside @xmath34 causing transition of the disk to the cold state when still eccentric .",
    "this decoupling of tidal and thermal stability brings the star to the minimum light with still precessing and elliptical disk .",
    "this hypothesis is confirmed by observations of ordinary superhumps both in quiescence and normal outbursts of v1159 ori and er uma ( patterson et al .",
    "1995 , gao et al . 1999 ,",
    "zhao et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "our observations shows that rz lmi also shows superhumps in minimum light .",
    "additionally , for the first time , we demonstrated that in interval covering at least 60 days ( including superoutbursts numbers i , ii and iii ) the star was showing superhumps with constant period which can be described by common ephemeris and phased without any phase shift .",
    "it indicates that decoupling could have place in this case and the disk of rz lmi was eccentric and precessing in the entire 60-day period .",
    "we have presented the results of two seasons observational campaign devoted to rz lmi . in total",
    "we detected 12 superoutbursts and 7 normal outbursts .",
    "our main findings may be summarized as follows :    * the @xmath0 brightness of the star varies in range from 16.5 to 13.9 mag . the superoutbursts occur every 19.07(4 ) days and last slightly over 10 days .",
    "the interval between two successive normal outbursts is 4.027(3 ) days . *",
    "the mean period of superhumps observed during all superoutbursts is @xmath1 days ( @xmath2 min ) . * during three consecutive superoutbursts of 2004 the superhump period was constant and the star `` remembered '' the phase of the superhumps from one superoutburst to another .",
    "it supports the hypothesis that er uma stars have accretion disks which are tidally unstable over long periods of time . *",
    "the period of superhumps detected in superoutburst no .",
    "v was increasing with the rate of @xmath24 * on one occasion we observed the ordinary superhumps in quiescence which seems to be common property of er uma stars . *",
    "no periodic light variations which can be connected with orbital period of the binary were seen .",
    "* striking stability of 19-day supercycle of rz lmi and high activity of the star may be caused by the presence of third body in the system .",
    "* acknowledgments . *",
