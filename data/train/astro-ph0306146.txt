    "herbig ae / be ( haebe ) are pre - main - sequence stars of intermediate mass .",
    "differences in physical properties , evolution , and circumstellar material allow a separation in two sub - groups : ae , spectral type later than or equal to b6 ; be , spectral type earlier than or equal to b5 ( natta et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this colloquium",
    ", it was also proposed another classification based on their spectral energy distribution ( sartori et al .",
    "2003 ) . from group 1",
    "to 4 , the fraction of the total flux emitted at infrared wavelengths increases .",
    "the pico dos dias survey ( pds  gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "1992 ; torres et al .",
    "1995 ; torres 1999 ) has found 105 haebe candidates .",
    "we present the polarization of a large portion of the above sample ( 81 objects ) and study possible correlations with the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "the study of the polarization in the context of the circumstellar material properties will be done elsewhere .",
    "we also present the spatial distribution of the haebe candidates relative to dark clouds .",
    "the observations have been done with the 0.60-m boller & chivens telescope at the observatrio do pico dos dias , brazil , operated by the laboratrio nacional de astrofsica , brazil , from 1998 to 2002 .",
    "it was used a ccd camera modified by the polarimetric module described in magalhes et al .",
    "the reduction has been done following the standard steps of differential photometry using the iraf facility .",
    "the polarimetric reduction was greatly facilitated by the used of the package _ pccdpack _ ( pereyra 2000 ) .",
    "the observed polarization is , in the general case , composed by two components : the intrinsic ( to the object ) polarization plus a foreground polarization ( produced in the intervening interstellar medium )",
    ". so the first step to study the polarization of a object is to estimate its foreground polarization which must be subtracted from the observed polarization .",
    "the foreground polarization is estimated by the weighted average of the polarization of the field stars in the ccd images .",
    "the number of objects in each field vary from 4 to more than 1000 : the average number is 175 .",
    "considering the standard mechanism of grain alignment in the interstellar medium , the foreground polarization traces the magnetic field direction .",
    "the intrinsic polarization gives us a direction related to the asymmetry of the envelope .",
    "we can ask if , in our sample , these two directions have some kind of correlation . for this",
    ", we define @xmath1  as the angle difference between the intrinsic polarization and the foreground polarization .",
    "-2.4 in 1.6 in    figure 1 shows the histogram of @xmath1 . when all objects are considered ( light hatching ) , there is clear peak around 90@xmath2 .",
    "however , an inspection of the data shows that this peak is associated with objects with small values of observed polarization . in this case",
    ", the intrinsic polarization will have the same modulus of the foreground polarization , but perpendicular to it : causing the peak observed at 90@xmath2 .",
    "probably these candidates are at small distances and the polarization of field stars - at larger distances than the candidate - represents a background ( not a foreground ) polarization . in that case",
    ", the foreground polarization must be negligible for these haebe candidates stars .    for the above reason",
    ", we also present the histogram considering only objects having the observed polarization larger than 0.5% ( dark hatching ) .",
    "these objects may be less affected by the foreground correction , since they must have a larger contribution from the intrinsic polarization to the observed value .",
    "the peak at 90@xmath2 disappears .",
    "a smaller peak at 0@xmath2 remains : this peak is also present for the stars with observed polarization larger than 3.0% ( black ) as well as for intrinsic polarization larger than 3.0% ( not shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "this excess of objects with @xmath1  around zero - 5% significant - could mean that the ambient interstellar magnetic field can play a role in shaping the envelope .",
    "the peak at 0@xmath2 does not exist if we separate the stars in spectral types or in sed groups , probable because the small number of objects .",
    "figure 2 shows the positions of the 105 haebe candidates in galactic coordinates and the positions of the dark clouds from lynds ( 1962 ) and feitzinger & stuwe ( 1984 ) nearest to the haebe candidates .",
    "the angular distance to the edge of the nearest cloud , @xmath3 , was calculated for all haebe candidates .",
    "negatives values of @xmath3 are obtained for objects seen in the cloud direction .",
    "a crude estimate to the error is 1@xmath2 .",
    "the distance histogram is shown in figure 3 .",
    "there is a clear peak at @xmath3 around 0.5@xmath2 .",
    "a number of 54 ( out of 105 ) objects has @xmath3 smaller than 1@xmath2 .",
    "group 4 ( ir dominated sed ) has a @xmath3 distribution statistically inconsistent with the other groups : the sources in that group have apparently smaller @xmath3 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the assumption that group 4 contains the younger objects ( more embedded ) .",
    "no significant statistical differences between the ae and be stars was found ."
