    "the physical origin of the supercurrent metastability is qualitatively illustrated in fig .",

    "the local minima of @xmath18 correspond to topologically distinct metastable states with @xmath20 .",
    "a direct @xmath21 transition between two such minima involves a discontinuous @xmath2 phase slip in the condensate wave function , occurring when a singly - charged vortex crosses the annulus .",
    "more generally , a superfluid can in principle also shed angular momentum in ways that break the @xmath22 quantisation , including condensate fragmentation and collective excitations such as solitons @xcite .",
    "for low enough superflow speeds all such processes are energetically costly and suppressed to various degrees .",
    "the dominant superflow decay mechanism depends on the system s dimensions , temperature , and the strength of interactions @xcite , and is often difficult to predict .",
    "the dissipative supercurrent decay is strictly speaking always stochastic , even if ( for sufficiently high flow speeds ) the superflow is unstable in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "however , we can distinguish qualitatively different decay regimes :    \\(1 ) if @xmath23 exceeds the critical velocity for some decay process , the decay becomes likely .",
    "ultimately it can occur on some microscopic timescale , which for an atomic bec is in the millisecond range . in this case , from an experimental point of view the decay can appear essentially instantaneous and deterministic .",
    "for example , we can not talk about a persistent current if it  persists \" for much less than one rotation period ( @xmath24ms in our experiments ) .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath25 the decay is strongly suppressed and the superflow can be almost perfectly stable , as for example observed in bulk superconductors .",
    "\\(3 ) in between these two extremes , metastable superflow should persist for much longer than the characteristic microscopic timescale of the physical system , but rare stochastic decay events can still occur through quantum or thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "such stochastic phase slips are , for example , associated with the residual resistance in thin - wire superconductors @xcite .",
    "the critical velocity for the occurrence of vortex - induced phase slips was famously first estimated by feynman : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the atom mass , @xmath28 the annulus width , and @xmath29 the healing length .",
    "this estimate is based on general energetic arguments , namely the cost of a vortex crossing a high superfluid - density region of characteristic size @xmath28 .",
    "it does not take into account the dynamical effects associated with the vortex penetrating the bec , nor the details of geometry such as the variation of the condensate density due to the harmonic trapping along the directions transverse to the ring .",
    "it is also important to note that in feynman s theory @xmath9 does not correspond to a sharp boundary between stable and unstable superflow .",
    "rather , @xmath9 just sets the natural scale for the superflow speed @xmath23 at which phase - slip induced supercurrent decay should become energetically favourable .",
    "neverthless , in some cases eq .",
    "( [ eq : feynman ] ) is found to provide a good estimate of @xmath8 @xcite .    in experiments on simply - connected rotating atomic gases",
    "@xcite it was often found that the critical velocity for a vortex entering the condensate was higher than predicted purely by global energetic arguments .",
    "this higher @xmath8 is associated with dynamical instabilities of surface excitations , which provide the necessary microscopic route for vortex nucleation .",
    "the  surface \" critical velocity at which such instability occurs was derived by anglin @xcite , properly taking into account the variation of the condensate density near its edge : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radial trapping frequency ( along the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis ) and @xmath32 the chemical potential .",
    "the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite are local , and consider only a surface region of size several @xmath29 .",
    "hence the theory should be equally applicable to rotating annular condensates , as long as both the width of the annulus and its inner radius are much larger than @xmath29 .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the expression for @xmath33 is the same , but one notes that due to the nature of the superfluid flow with quantised angular momentum the critical velocity is always first reached at the inner surface of the annulus .",
    "in other words , while a phase slip can formally be thought of either as a vortex crossing the annulus to exit the ring , or an anti - vortex entering the ring , in reality the former process is always more likely .    in our experiments",

    "<S> we study the metastability and decay of multiply - charged superflow in a ring - shaped atomic bose - einstein condensate . </S>",
    "<S> supercurrent corresponding to a giant vortex with topological charge up to @xmath0 is phase - imprinted optically and detected both interferometrically and kinematically . </S>",
    "<S> we observe @xmath1 superflow persisting for up to a minute and clearly resolve a cascade of quantised steps in its decay . </S>",
    "<S> these stochastic decay events , associated with vortex - induced @xmath2 phase slips , correspond to collective jumps of atoms between discrete @xmath3 values . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the ability to detect quantised rotational states with @xmath4 fidelity , which allows a detailed quantitative study of time - resolved phase - slip dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the supercurrent decays rapidly if the superflow speed exceeds a critical velocity in good agreement with numerical simulations , and we also observe rare stochastic phase slips for superflow speeds below the critical velocity . </S>"
