    "population iii stars are the first potential producers of uv photons that can contribute to the reionization process and are the first producers of the metals required for the formation of population ii stars .",
    "metals produced by the first stars will also be injected into some fraction of the ionized volume , and so will be present in gas falling into new or existing protogalactic halos .",
    "the question then arises as to how this low level of metal enrichment affects the ability of the gas to cool and collapse .    in @xcite ,",
    "the collapse of cold , metal - enriched gas in a top - hat potential was simulated .",
    "these simulations included the effects of atomic fine structure cooling , but did not include cooling from @xmath4 . in the absence of molecular cooling , fragmentation suggestive of a modern imf was found to occur only for metallicities above a threshold value of @xmath5 .",
    "however , the authors noted that the neglect of molecular cooling could be significant . in @xcite ,",
    "omukai et  al",
    ".   argued , based on the results of their detailed one - zone models , that molecular cooling would indeed dominate the cooling over many orders of magnitude in density .",
    "also , by starting with cold gas , the authors of @xcite implicitly assume that no extra entropy or energy has been added to the gas during its enrichment , although this is unlikely to be the case @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to consider whether a metallicity threshold appears in simulations with different initial conditions . in this paper , we examine a different , still idealized , set of initial conditions , using a more detailed treatment of the cooling and chemistry of the gas , and find no threshold .",
    "we argue that the transition from the primordial to the modern imf therefore depends on the conditions under which stars form as much as on the metal abundances present .",
    "to help us to assess the influence of metals on the fragmentation properties of gas in small protogalactic halos , we have performed a number of numerical simulations . here",
    "we present a portion of our results .",
    "detailed discussion of the full set of simulations can be found in @xcite ( hereafter paper v ) .",
    "our study requires us to follow the collapse of the gas over many orders of magnitude in density , and therefore the problem is well - suited for the use of a lagrangian numerical method .",
    "we use sph , a lagrangian method described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , in which the fluid is followed with an ensemble of particles .",
    "fluid properties at each point are computed by averaging over neighboring particles .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper use version 1 of the parallel sph code gadget @xcite . in order to achieve a higher mass resolution , we refine the mass of the gas particles using a method known as particle splitting @xcite . in @xcite , hereafter paper ii , we presented low - resolution simulations that show that the density increases most rapidly close to the center of the dark matter halo .",
    "on - the - fly splitting with two levels of refinement at two different radii provides us with the highest mass resolution at the region of interest . in the region of collapse",
    "we can resolve jeans masses down to 1.5  @xmath6 , as compared to @xmath7 in the low resolution simulations .",
    "we discuss the details of the implementation of the particle splitting algorithm in paper v.    as we want to represent gas that has collapsed beyond the resolution limit of the simulation in a numerically robust manner , we have modified the code to allow it to create sink particles  massive , non - gaseous particles , designed to represent dense cores , that can accrete gas from their surroundings but otherwise interact only via gravity @xcite .",
    "sink particles are created once the density rises above @xmath8 and are endowed with an accretion radius of @xmath9 . on every time step , any gas within this accretion radius that is gravitationally bound to the sink particle is accreted by it . the design and implementation of our sink particle algorithm",
    "is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "we have further modified gadget to allow us to follow the non - equilibrium chemistry of the major coolants in both primordial and low - metallicity gas .",
    "our chemical model is presented in @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter papers i and iii ) .",
    "provided that carbon and oxygen are amongst the most abundant metals , the major coolants will be largely the same as in local atomic and molecular gas , namely @xmath10 , hd , c , @xmath11 , o , si , @xmath12 , co , oh and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we therefore follow the abundances of these ten species , together with an additional 29 species that play important roles in determining the abundances of one or more of these coolants .",
    "our chemical network contains a total of 189 collisional gas - phase reactions between these 39 species , as well as 7 grain surface reactions , 43 reactions involving the photoionization or photodissociation of chemical species by ultraviolet radiation , and 8 reactions involving cosmic rays . for simplicity ,",
    "in the simulations presented in this paper we do not include the effects of dust , uv radiation or cosmic rays , and so use a simplified version of the model that contains only the collisional reactions .",
    "the thermal evolution of the gas in our simulations is modelled using a cooling function that includes the effects of atomic fine structure cooling from @xmath14 , @xmath11 , o , si and @xmath12 , rotational and vibrational cooling from @xmath10 , hd , co and @xmath13 , lyman-@xmath15 cooling , compton cooling , and @xmath16 recombination cooling , as well as a number of other processes of lesser importance . for additional details of our chemical networks and cooling function ,",
    "please consult papers i and iii ; further details of their implementation within gadget are also given in paper ii .",
    "our initial conditions are based on those used in paper ii , although collapse is followed to much higher density in the current work .",
    "we study protogalaxies forming from fully ionized gas with initial temperature @xmath17  k , representing a fossil h  ii region @xcite polluted by supernovae from the ionizing object .",
    "we model one such halo by using a fixed background potential with a spherically symmetric density profile @xcite .",
    "we study the evolution both of zero - metallicity , primordial gas and of metal - enriched gas with a metallicity @xmath18 . to simplify the discussion of our simulation results ,",
    "we take as a fiducial example a halo with a dark matter mass @xmath19 , an initial redshift @xmath20 , and a spin parameter @xmath21 . for this example halo , the virial temperature @xmath22 , the virial radius @xmath23 , and the truncation radius @xmath24 , where both radii are given in physical units .",
    "the scale radius @xmath25 of this example halo is @xmath26 , and the full computational volume is a box of side length @xmath27 .",
    "the gas mass is @xmath28 .",
    "in the simulations presented here we focus on gas with a metallicity @xmath29 .",
    "this metallicity is at the upper limit of the range of values proposed for the so - called critical metallicity @xmath30 , the value of the metallicity at which efficient fragmentation and low - mass star formation is hypothesized to first occur @xcite .",
    "it is also comparable to the globally averaged metallicity produced by the sources responsible for reionization ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we compare the temperature - density evolution of the run with primordial gas and the run with enriched gas .",
    "the two runs differ by less than 10% up to densities of @xmath31 .",
    "this result demonstrates that the cooling of the gas is barely influenced by the presence of metals : fine - structure cooling contributes only marginally to the total cooling rate .",
    "@xmath10 is the dominant coolant , rather than metal fine structure lines . at first sight ,",
    "the fact that fine structure cooling from metals has little impact on the thermal or dynamical evolution of the gas at metallicities below @xmath32 is somewhat surprising , given that it was previously found that gas with a metallicity of only @xmath33 could cool rapidly and fragment even in the complete absence of molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "however , this difference in conclusions appears to be a consequence of the different initial conditions used in the two sets of simulations , and the difference in the physics included . the simulations presented in @xcite neglected molecular cooling , and started with cold ( @xmath34 ) , low ionization ( @xmath35 ) gas in a flat , top - hat dark matter potential lacking a central condensation , although with local density perturbations .",
    "in these simulations , the gas cools , collapses and fragments only if the metallicity is high enough to render the cooling time shorter the the local dynamical timescale . with our arguably more realistic initial conditions , and , crucially , with our inclusion of @xmath4 , we find no metallicity threshold ",
    "@xmath4 cooling alone is sufficient to allow the gas to collapse , but the collapsing gas does not fragment ( see figure  [ fig2 ] and @xcite ) . in @xcite , we present a set of additional runs with metallicities up to @xmath36 that confirm this result .",
    "we conclude that the transition from the primordial to the modern - day imf therefore depends on the conditions under which stars form as much as on the metal abundances present .",
    "the actual conditions that are appropriate for second generation star formation still need to be determined in detail by observation and modeling of galaxy formation .       through the gas number density for the run with zero metallicity ( _ left panel _ ) and the run with a metallicity of @xmath39 ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "we show a box with a size of 20 pc.,title=\"fig : \" ]   through the gas number density for the run with zero metallicity ( _ left panel _ ) and the run with a metallicity of @xmath39 ( _ right panel _ ) .",
