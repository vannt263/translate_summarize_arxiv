    "multiparticle production and global observables such as mean multiplicity and its energy dependence alongside with total , elastic and inelastic cross ",
    "sections provide us a clue to the mechanisms of confinement and hadronization .",
    "general principles are very important in the nonperturbative sector of qcd and unitarity which regulates the relative strength of elastic and inelastic processes is the one of such principles . there is no universal , generally accepted method to implement unitarity in high energy scattering and as a result of this fact a related problem of the absorptive corrections role and their sign has a long history ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) . however , a choice of particular unitarization scheme is not just a matter of taste .",
    "long time ago arguments based on analytical properties of the scattering amplitude were put forward @xcite in favor of the rational form of unitarization .",
    "it was shown that this form of unitarization reproduced correct analytical properties of the scattering amplitude in the complex energy plane much easier compare to the exponential form .",
    "interest in unitarity limitations and the respective dependencies of the global observables was stimulated by the preparation of the experimental program for the lhc and the future plans to study soft interactions at the highest available energies .",
    "for example , correct account for unitarity is essential under theoretical estimates of the higgs production cross - section via diffractive mechanisms .",
    "the region of the lhc energies is the one where new , so called antishadow scattering mode can be observed .",
    "such a mode naturally appears when the rational form of unitarization being exploited @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this mode can be revealed at the lhc directly measuring @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite ( and not only by means of the analysis of impact parameter distributions ) .",
    "antishadowing leads to self  damping of the inelastic channels and asymptotically dominating role of elastic scattering , i. e. @xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "immediate question arises on consistency of this mechanism with the growth of mean multiplicity in hadronic collisions with energy . moreover , many models and experimental data suggest a power - ilke energy dependence of mean multiplicity and a priori the compatibility of such dependence with antishadowing is not evident .",
    "in this note we apply a rational ( @xmath4matrix ) unitarization method @xcite to consider the global features of multiparticle dynamics such as mean multiplicity and role of absorptive corrections .",
    "we show that it is possible to reproduce power - like energy behavior of the mean multiplicity in the model with antishadowing and discuss some physical implications .",
    "the rational form of unitarization is based on the relativistic generalization of the heitler equation of radiation dumping @xcite . in this approach",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude satisfies unitarity since it is a solution of the following equation @xmath5 presented here in the operator form .",
    "eq.[xx ] allows one to fulfill the unitarity provided the inequality @xmath6 is satisfied .",
    "the form of the amplitude in the impact parameter representation is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the generalized reaction matrix .",
    "it is considered as an input dynamical quantity similar to the eikonal function .",
    "it is to be noted that the analogous form for the scattering amplitude was obtained by feynman in his parton model for diffractive scattering which he has never published ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the impact parameter representation",
    "the unitarity equation rewritten at high energies for the elastic amplitude @xmath9 has the form @xmath10 where the inelastic overlap function @xmath11 is the sum of all inelastic channel contributions .",
    "it can be expressed as a sum of @xmath12particle production cross ",
    "sections at the given impact parameter @xmath13 where @xmath14 inelastic overlap function is related to @xmath8 according to eqs .",
    "( [ um ] ) and ( [ unt ] ) as follows @xmath15    then the unitarity eq . [ unt ] points out that the elastic scattering amplitude at given impact parameter value is determined by the inelastic processes when the amplitude is a pure imaginary one .",
    "[ unt ] imply the constraint @xmath16 while the `` black disk '' limit presumes inequality @xmath17 and the elastic amplitude satisfying the latter condition is a shadow of inelastic processes . in its turn",
    "the imaginary part of the generalized reaction matrix is the sum of inelastic channel contributions : @xmath18 where @xmath12 runs over all the inelastic states and @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ gam ] ) @xmath20 is the @xmath12particle element of the phase space volume .",
    "the functions @xmath21 are determined by dynamics of @xmath22 processes , where @xmath23 stands for the full set of respective kinematical variables .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath24 itself is a shadow of the inelastic processes .",
    "however , unitarity leads to self  damping of the inelastic channels @xcite in the sense that increase of the function @xmath24 results in decrease of the inelastic overlap function @xmath25 when @xmath24 exceeds unity ( cf .",
    "1 ) .    = 120",
    "mm    respective inclusive cross ",
    "section @xcite which takes into account unitarity in the direct channel has the form @xmath26 the function @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ un ] ) is expressed via the functions @xmath28 determined by the dynamics of the processes @xmath29 : @xmath30 and @xmath31    the kinematical variables @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for example ) refer to the produced particle @xmath35 and the set of variables @xmath36 describe the system @xmath37 of @xmath38 particles .",
    "now we turn to the mean multiplicity and consider first the corresponding quantity in the impact parameter representation . as it follows from the above the @xmath12particle production cross  section @xmath39 @xmath40 then the probability @xmath41    thus , we observe the cancellation of unitarity corrections in the ratio of the cross - sections @xmath39 and @xmath42",
    ". therefore the mean multiplicity in the impact parameter representation @xmath43 is not affected by unitarity corrections and therefore can not be proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) .",
    "the above mentioned proportionality is a rather natural assumption in the framework of the geometrical models , but it is in conflict with the unitarization . because of that the results @xcite based on such assumption should be taken with precaution .",
    "however , the above cancellation of unitarity corrections does not take place for the quantity @xmath44 which we address in the next section .",
    "we use a model for the hadron scattering described in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the ideas of chiral quark models .",
    "the picture of a hadron consisting of constituent quarks embedded into quark condensate implies that overlapping and interaction of peripheral clouds occur at the first stage of hadron interaction ( fig .",
    "2 ) . nonlinear field couplings could transform then the kinetic energy to internal energy and mechanism of such transformations was discussed by heisenberg @xcite and carruthers @xcite . as a result massive virtual quarks appear in the overlapping region and some effective field is generated .",
    "valence constituent quarks located in the central part of hadrons are supposed to scatter simultaneously in a quasi - independent way by this effective field .",
    "= 1.85 in    massive virtual quarks play a role of scatterers for the valence quarks in elastic scattering and their hadronization leads to production of secondary particles in the central region . to estimate number of such scatterers one could assume that part of hadron energy carried by the outer condensate clouds is being released in the overlap region to generate massive quarks . then",
    "this number can be estimated by : @xmath45 where @xmath46  constituent quark mass , @xmath47  average fraction of hadron energy carried by the constituent valence quarks .",
    "function @xmath48 describes condensate distribution inside the hadron @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is an impact parameter of the colliding hadrons .",
    "thus , @xmath51 quarks appear in addition to @xmath52 valence quarks . in elastic scattering",
    "those quarks are transient ones : they are transformed back into the condensates of the final hadrons .",
    "calculation of elastic scattering amplitude has been performed in @xcite . however , valence quarks can excite a part of the cloud of the virtual massive quarks and these virtual massive quarks will subsequently fragment into the multiparticle final states .",
    "such mechanism is responsible for the particle production in the fragmentation region and should lead to strong correlations between secondary particles .",
    "it means that correlations exist between particles from the same ( short  range correlations ) and different clusters ( long  range correlations ) and , in particular , the forward ",
    "backward multiplicity correlations should be observed .",
    "this mechanism can be called as a correlated cluster production mechanism .",
    "evidently , similar mechanism should be significantly reduced in @xmath53annihilation processes and therefore large correlations are not to be expected there .",
    "as it was already mentioned simple ( not induced by interactions with valence quarks ) hadronization of massive @xmath51 quarks leads to formation of the multiparticle final states , i.e. production of the secondary particles in the central region .",
    "the latter should not provide any correlations in the multiplicity distribution .",
    "remarkably , existence of the massive quark - antiquark matter in the stage preceding hadronization seems to be supported by the experimental data obtained at cern sps and rhic ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since the quarks are constituent , it is natural to expect direct proportionality between a secondary particles multiplicity and number of virtual massive quarks appeared ( due to both mechanisms of multiparticle production ) in collision of the hadrons with given impact parameter : @xmath54 with constant factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 where the function @xmath58 is the probability amplitude of the interaction of valence quark with the excitation of the effective field , which is in fact related to the quark matter distribution in this hadron - like object called the valence constituent quark @xcite .",
    "the mean multiplicity @xmath59 can be calculated according to the formula @xmath60 it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ mm ] ) and fig .",
    "1 that the antishadow mode with the peripheral profile of @xmath25 suppresses the region of small impact parameters the main contribution to the mean multiplicity is due to peripheral region of @xmath61 .    to make explicit calculations we model for simplicity the condensate distribution @xmath62 and the impact parameter dependence of the probability amplitude @xmath58 of the interaction of valence quark with the excitation of the effective field by the exponential forms , and thus we use exponential dependencies for the functions @xmath63 and @xmath62 with the different radii . then the mean",
    "multiplicity @xmath64 the function @xmath8 is chosen as a product of the averaged quark amplitudes @xmath65 in accordance since in the model valence quarks scatter in effective field simultaneously and quasi - independently .",
    "the @xmath50dependence of @xmath66 related to the quark formfactor @xmath67 has a simple form @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the generalized reaction matrix ( in a pure imaginary case ) gets the following form @xcite @xmath69^n \\exp(-mb/\\xi ) , \\label{x}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 . at sufficiently high energies where increase of the total cross",
    "sections is quite prominent we can neglect the energy independent term and rewrite the expression for @xmath8 as @xmath71    after calculation of the integrals ( [ mm ] ) we arrive to the power - like dependence of the mean multiplicity @xmath59 at high energies @xmath72 where @xmath73    = 3.5 in = 2.5 in    there are four free parameters in the model , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and the freedom in their choice is translated to @xmath78 , @xmath50 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the value of @xmath81 is fixed from the data on angular distributions @xcite and for the mass of constituent quark the standard value @xmath82 gev was taken .",
    "however , fit to experimental data on the mean multiplicity leads to approximate equality @xmath83 and actually eq .",
    "( [ asm ] ) is reduced to the two - parametric power - like energy dependence of mean multiplicity @xmath84 which is in good agreement with the experimental data ( fig .",
    "equality @xmath83 means that variation of the correlation strength with energy is weaker than the power dependence and could be , e.g. a logarithmic one . from the comparison with the data on mean multiplicity we obtain that @xmath85 , which corresponds to the effective masses , which are determined by the respective radii ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 .    the value of mean multiplicity expected at the lhc energy ( @xmath89 tev ) is about 110 .",
    "it is not surprising that it is impossible to differentiate contributions from the two mechanisms of particle production at the level of mean multiplicity .",
    "the studies of correlations are necessary for that purpose .",
    "it was shown that the model based on accounting unitarity @xcite and extended to multiparticle production provides a reasonable description of the energy dependence of mean multiplicity leading to its power - like growth with a small exponent .",
    "this result is a combined effect of unitarity and existence of the phase preceding hadronization when massive quark ",
    "antiquark pairs are generated .",
    "it is worth noting again that power  like energy dependence of mean multiplicity appears in various models and is in a good agreement with heavy ",
    "ion experimental data too .    multiplicity distribution @xmath90 and mean multiplicity @xmath91 in the impact parameter representation have no absorptive corrections , but since antishadowing leads to suppression of particle production at small impact parameters and the main contribution to the integral multiplicity @xmath59 comes from the region of @xmath61 .",
    "of course , this prediction is to be valid for the energy range where antishadow scattering mode starts to develop ( the quantitative analysis of the experimental data @xcite gives the value : @xmath92 tev ) and is therefore consistent with the `` centrality '' dependence of the mean multiplicity observed at rhic @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that no limitations follow from the general principles for the mean multiplicity , besides the well known one based on the energy conservation law .",
    "having in mind relation ( [ nsbex ] ) , we could say that the obtained power  like dependence which takes into account unitarity effects could be considered as a kind of a saturated upper bound for the mean multiplicity growth .      c. t. sachrajda and r. blankenbecler , phys .",
