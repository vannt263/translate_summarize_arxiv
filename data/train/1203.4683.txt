    "a long standing problem in high energy physics is understanding the quantum nature of gravity .",
    "the problem is often defined in terms of the planck scale , @xmath0 , which characterizes the strength of the gravitational interaction and sets the cut - off scale of the effective quantum field theoretic formulations for the strong , weak nuclear and electromagnetic interactions . over the past several decades",
    ", the planck scale has been regarded as a fundamental scale of physics , but the highness of the scale has been also known to lead to the notorious hierarchy problem .",
    "the big hierarchy between the planck scale ( @xmath1 ) and the electroweak scale ( @xmath2 ) can be translated into the extreme ratio between the gravitational constant , @xmath3 , and the fermi coupling constant , @xmath4 , which represents the relative weakness of the gravitational interaction compared to the weak nuclear interaction , as follows : @xmath5 the presence of a high scale is problematic particularly in the scalar sector since there is a large quantum quadratic correction , @xmath6 .",
    "the higgs sector of the standard model thus suffers from a fine - tuning problem at an extremely high level , @xmath7 when @xmath8 .",
    "it is evident that the level of fine tuning , @xmath9 , is essentially given by the ratio in eq . .",
    "the technical aspect of the fine - tuning problem is known to be resolved in the presence of additional symmetries such as supersymmetry and conformal symmetry provided that their breaking scales are close to the physical higgs mass , which still demands additional ( dynamical ) explanations .    in the past decade or",
    "so a new field has emerged in high energy physics and has expanded to other fields including quantum and classical gravity , cosmology , astrophysics and numerical relativity based on the realization that extra dimensions can lead to `` low scale gravity '' and `` brane world '' models . a higher dimensional brane world model with large , flat , extra dimensions ( arkani - hamed",
    ", dimopoulos and dvali ( add , 1998 ) @xcite , antoniadis+add ( aadd , 1998 ) @xcite ) and a five - dimensional model with a part of highly warped @xmath10 space ( rs ( 1999 ) @xcite ) have catalyzed an entirely new approach to the hierarchy problem . in these new higher dimensional models , a brane , like an ordinary domain wall , soliton or d - brane in string theory ,",
    "is introduced to confine a subset or entire fields of the standard model .",
    "gravitons , on the other hand , can propagate through the higher dimensional bulk and the effective strength of the gravitational interaction for a brane - localized field is diluted by the large volume of extra dimensions or red - shifted by the ` warp factor ' along extra dimension(s ) . as a result ,",
    "gravity becomes weak as has been observed in ordinary experiments .",
    "the true strength of gravity can only be measured at small distance scales below the compactification radius or the size of extra dimensions , but can cause interesting phenomenological consequences . on the true gravity scale , @xmath11 , can be as low as the electroweak scale then the hierarchy problem does not exist .",
    "the most striking prediction in low - scale gravity models is the production and decay of higher dimensional rotating black holes at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "indeed , back in 1974 penrose first showed that a black hole can be formed in classical high energy head - on collisions @xcite and in 1987 t hooft @xcite made preliminary arguments for graviton dominance and black hole formation in the trans - planckian domain , which has been clarified by many subsequent studies .",
    "the production of a black hole during particle collision can be easily understood when we accept the hoop conjecture suggested by thorne in 1972 @xcite .",
    "the hoop conjecture essentially states that a black hole forms if and only if a large amount of energy is packed in a small region that can be surrounded by a hoop with the schwarzschild radius of the energy .",
    "a high energy collider can provide an idealistic environment for this phenomenon as a large amount of energy can be concentrated at the moment of particle collision . in the models with large or highly warped extra dimensions ,",
    "gravity becomes strong at a low scale in a tev range so that one can conclude that a collider with a multi - tev collision energy , such as the lhc , can produce black holes with @xmath12 sized event horizons .",
    "some rough estimation using the geometric cross - section for black hole production , @xmath13 , were made by banks and fischler ( 1999 ) @xcite , giddings and thomas ( 2001 ) @xcite , and dimopoulos and landsberg ( 2001 ) @xcite have drawn considerable attention not only from physics communities focused on high energy , string theory , general relativity , numerical relativity , and cosmology , but also from the general public including even opponents of the lhc experiment ( see @xcite and @xcite for scientific responses to the opponents ) .",
    "we also note that argyres et al .",
    "( 1998 ) @xcite considered the tev scale primordial black holes as dark matter candidates or as seeds for early galaxy formation .",
    "after formation , a black hole radiates energy through hawking radiation @xcite mainly to the standard model particles on brane @xcite .",
    "the decay signatures depend on greybody factors , @xmath14 , and a thermal factor with angular velocity at the horizon @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denote the energy , spin and angular momentum quantum numbers of the radiated particle , respectively . in the semi - classical domain ,",
    "greybody factors have been obtained for an arbitrary spin ( @xmath18 ) in @xcite , @xcite ( also see @xcite for various extensions ) .",
    "the full calculation for gravitational radiation ( @xmath19 ) is still not available , but there have been some recent developments @xcite .",
    "semi - realistic monte - carlo ( mc ) event generators for the black hole events at the lhc have been developed .",
    "the most developed mc generators are blackmax @xcite and charybdis @xcite ( also see catfish @xcite ) .",
    "blackmax v.2 and charybdis v.2 are used for lhc black hole searches by the cms and atlas collaborations .    in this article , we review the theoretical and experimental foundations of this rapidly developing field .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : highd ] with an introduction to physics in higher dimensions , in which we explain low - scale gravity models with large and warped extra dimensions .",
    "we also give a short introduction to compact hyperbolic extra dimensions where light kaluza - klein states are not necessarily expected , but still the gravity scale can be low ( @xmath20 )",
    ". section [ sec : blackobjects ] describes the black hole solutions in higher dimensions where the black hole uniqueness theorem is not generally valid .",
    "emphasis is placed on the myers - perry black hole , black rings and multiple black hole solutions and their stability issues .",
    "section [ sec : energy domain ] is devoted to describing physics in the trans - planckian energy domain .",
    "we explain how the known physics of combining quantum field theory and classical general relativity provides good descriptions in the trans - planckian domain and review the black hole formation process by superimposing the two aichelburg - sexl solutions to estimate the cross section for making black holes in particle collisions .",
    "an extended phase diagram for the relation between the probing distance and the available energy is also explained at the end . in section [ sec : lhc ] we focus on the lhc experiment to identify black hole signatures .",
    "the expected signatures are obtained considering the precise greybody factors .",
    "issues in the balding and planck phases of the produced black hole are discussed . after reviewing the recent lhc result with @xmath21 tev collision energy , we critically re - examine the interpretations . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude with a discussion of future higher energy runs with @xmath22 and open problems .",
    "we present the relevant physical scales in appendix [ appendix:1 ] and briefly sketch the numerical method to solve the generalized teukolsky equation to calculate the greybody factors in appendix [ appendix:2 ] .",
    "some aspects of this topic have been described in other reviews by landsberg @xcite , kanti @xcite , giddings @xcite and park @xcite and also in lectures by kanti @xcite .",
    "in this section we first provide a generalization of spacetime taking @xmath23-extra dimensions into account .",
    "indeed , no particularly compelling theoretical reason exists for three spatial dimensions .",
    "one may note that only in @xmath24 dimensions , the kepler problem with the potential of the form @xmath25 allows closed orbits @xcite and thus one may find an anthropic reason for the three existing _ large _ spatial dimensions .",
    "however , it still allows the existence of the extra _ microscopic _ dimensions , which are not responsible for the planetary motions .",
    "more importantly , consistency conditions for the known extension of einstein gravity and the quantum field theoretical embedding of it , namely , string and supergravity theories , require a certain number of extra dimensions .",
    "furthermore , it has been revealed that extra dimensions can provide totally new insights to reformulate the notorious old problems in particle physics including the big hierarchy problem , which will be discussed in this section .      in @xmath24 dimensions ,",
    "pure gravity is described by einstein - hilbert action : @xmath26 where @xmath27 . setting the action dimensionless ( @xmath28 )",
    ", the newton s constant @xmath29 has a dimension of @xmath30 ^ 2=\\left[\\text{mass}\\right]^{-2}$ ] and thus defines a mass scale , @xmath31 .",
    "this scale is nothing but the planck scale @xmath32 gev @xcite .    in the presence of the extra @xmath23-dimensions",
    ", the einstein - hilbert action can be generalized to a form @xmath33 where @xmath34 has a dimension of @xmath30^{d-2}=\\left[\\text{mass}\\right]^{-d+2}$ ] as @xmath35=\\left[\\text{length}\\right]^{-2}$ ] .",
    "a higher dimensional generalization of einstein equations could be obtained by varying the action in eq . .",
    "one may define a generalized planck scale in @xmath36-dimensions ( see appendix [ appendix:1 ] for planck units in @xmath36 dimensions ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a numerical factor for which different definitions have been employed in the literature .",
    "some representative definitions that are widely utilized include the particle data group convention ( pdg ) @xcite , which is the same convention in ida - oda - park ( iop ) @xcite , the randall - sundrum convention ( rs ) @xcite , giddings - thomas convention ( gt)@xcite and dimopoulos - landsberg convention ( dl ) @xcite : @xmath39 in this review , we follow the pdg convention . now , starting from the higher dimensional action , @xmath40 , the four - dimensional action @xmath41 can be derived as an effective action after integrating out the extra coordinates . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath42 should be regarded as a fundamental scale of gravity , from which the planck scale in four dimensions is derived after compactification .",
    "let us consider a pretty general model of an extra dimension with a `` warp factor '' @xmath43 , which is a monotonic positive function of the extra coordinate @xmath44 .",
    "if we require the 4d poincar invariance at each point of @xmath44 , the full metric of @xmath45-dimensional spacetime can be written in general as @xmath46 where we assume @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "we do not consider a negative warp factor value to avoid a naked singularity in extra dimensions . with the assumed monotonic property of the warp factor",
    ", we can link the change in the position along the extra dimension and the renormalization group  running \" with respect to the energy scale .",
    "thus one can impose the geometric meaning on the uv - scale and ir - scale in extra dimensions .",
    "if the warp factor is trivial , @xmath48 , and the extra dimension is flat , @xmath49 , the resultant geometry is simple , thus we can easily compute the @xmath50 effective action as follows:@xmath51{g_{mn}=-\\delta_{mn } } & -\\int d^n y \\sqrt{g_y } \\frac{1}{16\\pi g_d } \\times \\int d^4 x \\sqrt{g } r + \\cdots ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{v_n}{16\\pi g_d } \\times \\int d^4 x \\sqrt{g } r + \\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we can find the relationship between the newton s constant in @xmath50 and in general dimensions:@xmath52 here , the volume of the extra dimension is denoted by @xmath53 . if the volume of the flat extra dimension is _ large _ , @xmath54 , we get a tiny newton s constant @xmath55 , thus the huge planck mass @xmath56 .",
    "the large extra dimensions provide a geometrical explanation for why we have weak gravity or a large planck scale as was suggested by ( a)add @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting possibility is that @xmath11 is as low as the electroweak scale of the order of @xmath57 tev ( @xmath58 ) such that there is no hierarchy between the fundamental scale and the electroweak scale .",
    "the solution to the hierarchy problem works if@xmath59 where we took @xmath60 tev and @xmath61 .",
    "the actual numbers for various dimensions are @xmath62 obviously the first case , @xmath63 , is ruled out by astronomical measurements .",
    "the second case , @xmath64 , is also ruled out by the short - distance torsion pendulum experiments carried out by kapner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) @xcite and adelberger et al .",
    "( 2006 ) @xcite . due to the mass gap",
    ", ( @xmath65 ) is small with a large volume , and kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons can contribute to astrophysical processes such that models with a larger number of extra dimensions ( @xmath66 ) can also be strongly constrained .",
    "the requirement that kk gravitons do not contribute to the supernova cooling process by carrying the energy away gives the bound @xmath67 a few tev for @xmath68 ( hanhart et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "an even stronger bound , @xmath69 tev was found by hannestad - raffelt ( 2001 ) @xcite from measurements of diffuse @xmath70 ray detection by the egret satellite for @xmath68 and also for more involved processes with supernovas , neutron stars and pulsars ( hannestad - raffelt ( 2002 ) ) @xcite .",
    "all these astrophysical bounds are for light kk gravitons @xmath71 mev , thus a nontrivial extra dimension model with a larger mass gap is not constrained by them . taking the possible large astronomical uncertainties into account , @xmath66 cases are still not excluded .",
    "when @xmath72 is a non - trivial function of @xmath73 ( again we still require a monotonic property ) , the geometry is warped and the effective theory has a scaling behavior , @xmath74 . as in the flat case , we can read out the effective action by integrating the extra dimensions out as follows : @xmath75{g_{mn}=-\\delta_{mn } } & -\\int d^n y   w^4(y ) \\frac{1}{16\\pi g_d } \\times \\int d^4 x \\sqrt{\\bar{g } } w^{-2}\\bar{g}^{\\mu\\nu}r_{\\mu\\nu } + \\cdots ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{\\tilde{v}_n}{16\\pi g_d } \\times \\int d^4 x \\sqrt{\\bar{g } } \\bar{r } + \\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where barred quantities are canonically normalized .",
    "we can derive the conventional newton constant out of the higher dimensional gravitational constant as @xmath76 where `` warped volume '' is defined as @xmath77 with the nontrivial warp factor @xmath72 in the metric along the extra dimensions .",
    "for concreteness , we consider the @xmath63 case in detail here @xmath78 which yields a natural relationships among dimensionful parameters , @xmath79 .",
    "for instance , an ads space with @xmath80 gives @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the ads curvature .",
    "thus , @xmath83 .    notably the standard model ( or at least the higgs field )",
    "is confined to the  ir - brane \" located at @xmath84 .",
    "( conversely , the  uv - brane \" is at @xmath85 . )",
    "the lagrangian for the higgs field is read as follows : @xmath86 by rescaling the kinetic term in @xmath87 and taking the warp factor into account , the physical higgs field with the canonically normalized kinetic term is defined as @xmath88 , and the physical mass parameter on the ir ( and uv ) brane is given as @xmath89 in ads space , @xmath90 such that the actual physical mass scale on the ir - brane is exponentially small compared to the one on the uv - brane .",
    "this phenomenon takes place due to the warp factor , which changes the `` ruler '' at each position @xmath73 . having exponential dependence",
    ", we can easily generate a big hierarchy between the uv - scale and the ir - scale as randall and sundrum ( 1999 ) @xcite showed .",
    "a slice of ads space arises as a solution to the five - dimensional einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant ( ads curvature ) in the bulk and well - balanced tensions for uv ( ir)-branes . the setup provides an explanation as to why the ir - scale ( or electroweak scale ) is much lower than the uv scale ( or planck scale ) . in this setup , the fields on the ir - brane can `` feel '' the strong gravity on the ir scale @xmath91 , and the planck - tev hierarchy is given by the warp factor : @xmath92 the most important lesson here is that gravity may become strong at the ir scale ( @xmath93 ) in the presence of warped extra dimensions",
    ". if the extra dimension is large or highly warped , the strong gravity scale can be as low as the electroweak scale such that there is no hierarchy between the gravity scale and the electroweak scale .",
    "this is a unique feature of a higher dimensional setup that can not be found in four - dimensional effective theories .",
    "this understanding opens up an entirely new area of extremely interesting phenomenological consequences including black hole production at the lhc .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that we live in higher dimensional spacetime , which contains compact hyperbolic extra dimensions .",
    "the compact hyperbolic spaces ( chs ) have been relatively less intensively studied by physicists so far but its interesting mathematical properties have been explored since original work by distinguished mathematicians including selberg(1965 ) @xcite , mostow(1968 ) @xcite and thurston ( 1978)@xcite . in particular , there are two properties listed below that deserve further attention .    *",
    "rigidity : proved by mostow ( 1968 ) . * large mass gap : conjectured by selberg ( 1965 ) .",
    "a chs can be obtained by taking a quotient space of a @xmath94hyperbolic space ( @xmath95 ) with its fundamental group ( @xmath96 ) : @xmath97 . if we do not consider a cusped hyperbolic three - manifold or incomplete metric , the _ mostow s rigidity theorem _ states that the geometry of a chs of dimension greater than two ( @xmath98 ) is determined by its fundamental group .",
    "this means that once we fixed the local curvature of chs , @xmath99 , and the volume , no more moduli remains to be fixed .",
    "this is largely different from other extra dimensions which often suffer from shape moduli stabilization issues .",
    "of course , there remains the issue of super - selection of a particular fundamental group among many others .",
    "the large mass gap of chs is based on the conjecture by selberg ( 1965 ) , who stated that there is a lower bound of the first eigenmode of the laplace - beltrami operator on chs determined by the following inequality : @xmath100 indeed luo and rudnick ( 1995 ) @xcite proved the conjecture up to @xmath101 using number theory approaches , and cornish and turok ( 1998 ) @xcite and cornish and spergel ( 1999 ) @xcite also studied higher excitation modes on chs .",
    "the presence of the lower bound opens up an entirely new perspective of extra dimensional physics .",
    "usually , as in torus compactification , a large volume implies a small mass gap of the order of @xmath102 . since the large volume is responsible for the small fundamental gravity scale ( see eq . ) ,",
    "a small mass gap or a light kk excitation of a bulk field seems unavoidable .",
    "however , due to the existence of the selberg s bound , chs does not have to accompany a light mode .",
    "this is a big advantage in terms of model building .",
    "if there is no light kaluza - klein state , the effect of extra dimensions is hidden and the model does not affect low energy experiments . in this case , the extra dimension is evident only through the strong gravity effect such as black hole production at particle colliders .",
    "this possibility was recently studied by orlando and park ( 2010 ) @xcite ( also see @xcite for an inflationary model based on chs ) .      in pure general relativity ,",
    "the only input parameter is the number of spacetime dimensions . in string theory ,",
    "a certain number of extra dimensions are required to be introduced to formulate the theory in a consistent way .",
    "recently we have observed in many theoretical studies that the presence of extra dimensions provides new insights into many problems in particle physics too .",
    "on the other hand , we do not have any concrete experimental ` data ' for extra dimensions thus we can only theoretically model the topological and geometrical structure of ` hidden ' dimensions .",
    "recently suggested ` large ' and ` highly warped ' and also ` hyperbolic ' extra dimensions have opened a new window to addressing the problem of weak gravity or hierarchy in energy scales .",
    "a particularly interesting possibility is that the fundamental scale of gravity ( which is supposed to be the largest scale of physics ) may not be extremely large as was traditionally suggested by planck energy , but can be as low as a tev at least for a higgs sector .",
    "if the low scale of gravity is really built in , we may learn about the presence of extra dimensions by experimentally probing the strong gravitational phenomena . the most dramatic phenomenon , which may not be that far from us ,",
    "is microscopic black hole production and their decay at the lhc and sky @xcite .",
    "most probably those microscopic black holes are higher dimensional as long as their ` size ' is much smaller than the compactification radius or local curvature radius of the background extra dimension : @xmath103 however , one should note that the details of ` black hole signatures ' depend on the detailed structure of extra dimensions and also the precise distribution of matter fields in higher dimensions which we can only make models .",
    "also we have to assume that our theoretical understanding of the quantum nature of gravity is limited .",
    "the best thing we can try now is making concrete and sound ` predictions ' of a given set of models with theoretical confidence . a black hole can be well described by a semi - classical picture as long as its ` size ' is big compared to the planck length : @xmath104 the next section discusses for such semi - classical and higher dimensional black holes .",
    "in this section , we review the black objects in higher dimensions . indeed in higher dimensions , a generalization of the black hole uniqueness theorem is not valid @xcite , and a number of black objects can exist that share the same mass and angular momentum . for instance , the higher dimensional generalization of the kerr black hole , or the myers - perry(mp ) black hole , can share the same mass and angular momentum with black rings ( br ) , the topology of which is distinguishable from the simple sphere of the mp black hole : @xmath105 ( br ) vs. @xmath106 ( mp bh ) in five dimensions ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "an even further set of solutions seem to exist in higher dimensions ( @xmath108 ) , thus the _ classification _ of all stationary , asymptotically flat ( or ads , ds or hyperbolic ) black hole solutions to the higher dimensional einstein equation ( in vacuum or with coupled matter ) becomes a major problem in the study of higher dimensional gravity .    in particle collisions , however , the most relevant solution is the mp black hole as other solutions seem to suffer from various instabilities ( there is instability even for the mp black hole , especially at a high rotation limit ) . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the mp black hole , black rings and other black hole solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "the generalization of the schwarzschild solution in higher dimensions is obtained by replacing @xmath109 dependence of the newtonian potential with @xmath110 as tangherlini found in 1963 @xcite : @xmath111 where a mass parameter @xmath112 is defined as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the area of a unit @xmath23-sphere . under the linearized gravitational perturbations ,",

    "if one of the low scale gravity models is realized in nature , the microscopic black holes on the 1 tev scale will be produced at the lhc and their signatures , especially the hawking radiation , might provide a valuable guide to providing a deeper level of understanding of quantum gravity and spacetime structure . in this article",
    ", we review the progress of understanding this exciting area of research over the past decade , emphasizing both theoretical and experimental efforts . on the theoretical side , analytic as well as numerical studies have been performed to understand the dynamical process of black hole formation in high energy collisions mostly in the semi - classical domain .",
    "the hawking radiation to brane localized fields ( and also partly to the bulk fields ) from a higher dimensional rotating black hole is understood via the precise calculation of greybody factors .",
    "monte - carlo simulation codes have been developed for the `` black hole events '' at the lhc .",
    "on the experimental side , the lhc begins to produce data for the tev scale gravity models and will reach the true trans - planckian or microscopic black hole domain in the coming years after its collision energy is upgraded to @xmath405 tev from the current @xmath402 tev as the lhc was originally designed . even though the current understanding is limited due to the lack of a full quantum gravity model , we hope to learn more by observing real data from the tev domain .",
    "finally , a short comment on the safety of the lhc is in order .",
    "the recent analysis shows that the macroscopic effects of tev - scale black holes should have already been seen in various astrophysical environments if those black holes are dangerously long - lived or even stable @xcite .",
    "this analysis is important since it excludes the possibility that any mini black holes that might be produced by the lhc could cause catastrophic damage .",
    "if the lhc can produce black holes , there are various places in the universe such as neutron stars and white dwarfs where similar mini black holes can also be produced at an even more frequent rate by collisions of the ultra - high energy cosmic ray particles and nucleons in those dense astronomical objects .",
    "basically all of those dense astrophysical objects are of the same or a higher level of danger .",
    "thus , the null observed signals from those dense astrophysical objects ensures that there is no risk of any significance whatsoever from such black holes .",
