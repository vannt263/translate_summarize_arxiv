    "<S> the so - called `` minimal susy @xmath0 gut '' ( msgut )  @xcite makes use of one @xmath9 and one @xmath7 scalar irrep for the yukawa couplings , to account for all fermion masses and mixings  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite it was shown that the scalar 120-plet plays a crucial role for that purpose ; a certain texture of the yukawa coupling matrices  similar to our numerical solution  ( [ solution])enables that suppression even for large @xmath150 .    </S>",
