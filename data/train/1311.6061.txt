    "thinking of these as first - order differential operators , we define the heisenberg sub - laplacian to be the second - order subelliptic operator @xmath45 in @xcite , folland found the fundamental solution to the heisenberg sub - laplacian @xmath46 : @xmath47 in @xcite we computed @xmath48 ; for our purposes it suffices to leave @xmath49 as a positive constant .",
    "we recognize that this potential has a singularity at the origin @xmath50 but is smooth away from this point .",
    "the singularity corresponds physically to our planet crashing into the sun , at which point the planet s potential energy is @xmath51 and its kinetic energy is @xmath52 .",

    "can be expressed as the invariance under an action of the compact one - dimensional lie group @xmath82 , symplectic reduction reduces the dimension of our system by one .",
    "the only other symmetries are reflections , corresponding to actions of discrete lie groups .    however , the dilations @xmath35 correspond to an @xmath83-action which is nearly a symmetry .",
    "our hamiltonian is not preserved , but is homogeneous of degree @xmath84 : @xmath85 more precisely , the dilations are generated by the function @xmath86 which satisfies @xmath87 .",
