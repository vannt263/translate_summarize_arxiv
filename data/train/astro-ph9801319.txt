    "in standard big - bang cosmologies , observable structures are assumed to form from small density fluctuations , that first expand with the universe while growing linearly , then collapse non - linearly to bound systems",
    ". these fluctuations could be adiabatic , in which case they would be damped on scales below @xmath3m@xmath1 before recombination ( silk 1968 ; where @xmath4 is the hubble constant in units of 100kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "isothermal fluctuations can also exist ( and , of course , also intermediate states ) , and in such cases , the first non - linear objects are much smaller .",
    "if the density fluctuations spectrum is assumed self - similar , with a slope @xmath6 such that @xmath7 then the largest masses to become non - linear after recombination , i.e. at @xmath8 , are of the order of @xmath9 m@xmath1 , depending on @xmath10 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 , if the spectrum is calibrated from the presently observed correlation function ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "that means that all masses smaller than @xmath9m@xmath1 , and larger than the jeans mass , which is @xmath11m@xmath12 at @xmath13 , will collapse , become bound , and decouple from expansion ( at this epoch the jeans length is of the order of 2pc@xmath14 .",
    "in fact , since in every hierarchical model with @xmath15 the smallest masses have more density contrast , structures at precisely the jeans mass collapse first .",
    "the masses correspond to typical @xmath16 giant molecular clouds .",
    "the nature of the collapse has been studied by many authors .",
    "if cooling is efficient enough ( @xmath17 ) , the collapse is quasi - isothermal , and fragmentation occurs , since the jeans mass becomes smaller and smaller as the density increases ( e.g. , hoyle 1953 ) .",
    "this means that pressure forces are at most equal to gravity forces , and can not stop the collapse .",
    "this fragmentation process occurs currently in the galactic interstellar medium in a self - similar hierarchical structure ( larson 1981 ; scalo 1985 ) , and might even be pursued down to very low masses in particularly cold and quiet regions , such as the outer parts of galaxies ( pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "fragmentation is limited by opacity , and the smallest fragments ( or clumpuscules ) , which are at the transition of being pressure supported , are today of the order of @xmath18 m@xmath1 , and their mass grows slowly , as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , with redshift .",
    "this assumes a quasi - isothermal regime for the bottom of the hierarchy ( containing most of the mass ) ; therefore it is important that gas cooling remains efficient .",
    "this might look as a problem for gas just after recombination , since it is metal poor without grains : if above @xmath21k the main coolant is atomic hydrogen ( by collisional excitation of ly@xmath22 ) , in fact below this temperature the vibration - rotation lines of molecular hydrogen take over until @xmath23k , because a significant quantity of h@xmath2 molecules forms through h@xmath24 and h@xmath25 .",
    "below 200k , hd is then more efficient ( palla & zinnecker 1987 ; puy & signore 1996 ) .",
    "many groups have tackled the problem of computing the physico - chemistry of the primordial gas , to determine the size of the first forming bound structures ( yoneyama 1972 ; hutchins 1976 ; carlberg 1981 ; palla et al .",
    "1983 ; lepp & shull 1984 ) .",
    "all of them have found that the cooling is indeed efficient , as soon as the redshift is below @xmath26 , and the calculated masses of fragments are in the wide range @xmath27m@xmath1 .",
    "even if clouds of just the jeans mass see their collapse somewhat delayed because of pressure forces , the latter are negligible for clouds of @xmath28m@xmath1 ( lahav 1986 ) . in more realistic scenarios ,",
    "the collapse is not spherical , but does form sheets and filaments ( larson 1985 ) .",
    "the latter have the advantage that in 1d , pressure forces have always the same dependence with radius than the gravity forces , and therefore can not halt the collapse , whatever the cooling ( uehara et al .  1996 ; inutsuka & miyama 1997 ) .",
    "therefore fragmentation is inevitable .",
    "the conclusions drawn from these studies were all concerning the first generation of stars , since _ no outcome to fragmentation other than star formation was considered_. already peebles & dicke ( 1968 ) concluded that the first objects to form were the globular clusters , through such a fragmentation process , followed by star formation .",
    "palla et al .",
    "( 1983 ) considered the h@xmath2 formation through the very efficient 3-body process , when the density is higher than @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "they concluded that all the primordial gas is converted in h@xmath2 at a density of @xmath31@xmath30 , and that the jeans mass eventually falls below 0.1m@xmath1 , allowing the whole mass spectrum for the first forming stars .",
    "rotation could hinder the collapse ( kashlinsky & rees 1983 ) , and this could lead to population iii low - mass stars as well as super - massive objects ( vmo s ) , both of which could contribute to dark matter .",
    "taking the observations of the ism at face , which show that the efficiency of star formation is very low , we propose here that the bulk of the gas in this first collapse of gmc - size primordial clouds after recombination and decoupling form clumpuscules , assembled in a hierarchical or fractal structure .",
    "the molecular density of these clumpuscules should be very high ( @xmath32 to @xmath31@xmath30 ) , when at the limit of being pressure supported , at the temperature of the cosmic background .",
    "although theoretically not well understood , observations show that the efficiency of star formation is highly variable , and must be very low in some cases ( e.g. , in low surface brightness galaxies such as malin 1 ) .",
    "since the physical conditions of the gas at @xmath33 is similar to the present outer parts of galaxies , we expect that the conditions for triggering global star formation are generally not met .",
    "larger scales structures such as the galaxy - size ones , have not then collapsed and decoupled from expansion , therefore there does not exist a deep enough potential well to accumulate mass to the critical density for star - formation ( kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "indeed , star formation is hindered when the medium is only mildly unstable , so that pressure forces compensate gravity forces .",
    "that is the case , when the collapsing masses are always of the order of the jeans mass .",
    "in the first collapse of the giant molecular clouds of @xmath34m@xmath1 , this is the case , since the jeans mass decreases gradually as fragmentation proceeds . when galaxy sized masses collapse , leading to more violent instabilities , large fluctuations , and shocks at the origin of starbursts , they are much higher than the jeans mass . however , when a disk forms , rotation takes over , and also compensates for the gravity forces at large scale .",
    "the pressure forces stabilise the smallest scales ( given by the toomre criterion ) , and rotation stabilises the large scales ( allowing disk structures to survive ) .",
    "apparently , in galactic disks star formation occurs substantially when the stability conditions are violated at intermediate scales .",
    "note that the toomre criterion does not prevent the formation of substructures when the medium is rapidly cooling .",
    "we expect that the smallest fragments are in quasi - thermal equilibrium with the microwave background , and statistical dynamical equilibrium between coalescence and fragmentation over the whole hierarchy of structures ( pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "the dissipation is thus minimised , since the temperature of the fragments is very close to that of the cosmic background .",
    "clumpuscules are thought as dynamical entities , they are frequently reshuffled by collisional disruption and coalescence .",
    "they permanently reform through jeans instability and fragmentation , so the dynamical quasi - equilibrium is statistical along the whole hierarchy of clumps .    at high redshift ( @xmath35 ) therefore , only sporadic star - formation ( or even machos formation ) should occur in rare places , and that might be sufficient to initiate the reionization and the re - heating of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , as is necessary to explain the high ionization fraction of the lyman-@xmath22 absorbers ( tegmark et al.1984 ) and the omnipresent heii gas at @xmath36 ( jacobsen et al .  1994 ; davidsen et al .  1996 ; reimers et al .",
    "the first generation of stars could form today a small percentage of the dark halos around galaxies under the form of white or brown dwarfs ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "once the bulk of the gas mass has condensed into cold molecular hydrogen at @xmath37 , the clumps survive the reionization phase of the igm in large part , because of their high column density ( @xmath38 @xmath39 ) , that self - shields them from the radiation , and their fractal structure , which is more gregarious than an homogeneous distribution in space ( cf .",
    "combes & pfenniger 1997 ) .",
    "some erosion occurs , mainly at the interfaces , which produces first atomic hydrogen , then ionized gas .",
    "but in the densest environments , that will become the galaxies , the bulk of the gas remains in cold clumpuscules .",
    "the estimation of the column density threshold of atomic hydrogen at the ionizing limit can be obtained from the measured and modeled values of the extra - galactic ionizing radiation , that is known now within a factor of a few .",
    "the extra - galactic background , essentially from the quasar uv light , provides an ionization rate of @xmath40s@xmath5 , a value corresponding to the study of low - redshift lyman-@xmath22 absorption lines ( madau 1992 ) . as in the  strmgren sphere theory \" , there is a sharp transition ( a true ionizing front ) between the neutral and ionized phases , and the transition limit is around @xmath41@xmath39 , for usual disk gas volumic densities @xmath6 ( it decreases as @xmath42 ) .",
    "this corresponds well to the observed sudden decrease from a column density of @xmath43@xmath39 to 2 @xmath44@xmath39 in the outskirts of hi disks ( corbelli & salpeter 1993 ) .",
    "although the extra - galactic flux might increase with redshift , it seems therefore quite easy to conserve the cold h@xmath2 clumps within their hi interface at high redshifts .",
    "the details of h@xmath2 chemistry and cooling has been widely developed ( lepp & shull 1984 ; haiman et al .",
    "1996a ; tegmark et al .",
    "numerical 3d simulations have been performed ( abel et al .",
    "1997 ; anninos et al .",
    "1997 ) , in the aim of determining the mass of the first luminous objects to form , and of following the effective jeans mass as a function of redshift .",
    "it was shown that very small masses ( @xmath45m@xmath1 ) could be formed before reionization ( @xmath46 ) , but then the first stellar formation would produce enough uv radiation to destroy the molecules ( haiman et al.1997 ) , although the exact processes are complex ( the uv irradiation could even trigger extra - cooling by favoring h@xmath2 formation , haiman et al .",
    "this h@xmath2 destruction through the reionization period is used to delay the formation of dwarf galaxies , since giant molecular clouds will not form again until low redshifts , when efficient cooling is provided by the metals ( norman & spaans 1997 ; kepner et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "= 7.3 cm = 7.3 cm    the formation of small molecular clouds before reionization is therefore not in doubt , and we show in a simple model resolving the chemistry and cooling equations , that high enough densities are indeed achieved . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we adopt a simple scheme very similar to that of tegmark et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : since we stop when the clumpuscules become optically thick with respect to the h@xmath2 rotational lines ( i.e. , at column densities of the order of @xmath47@xmath39 , and volumic density of @xmath48@xmath30 ) , we have to consider the gas thermal history of a unit volume only , irrespective of the mass of the condensed object .",
    "the density before virialisation is determined by the simple top - hat model , and when virialised , we consider its possible recursive fragmentation . to fix ideas , we adopt physical parameters compatible with the observed fractal of the milky way molecular ism , a fractal dimension of @xmath49 , and a number of fragments of @xmath50 at each level ( pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "the ratio between the different scales of the hierarchy is then @xmath51 and the density ratio is @xmath52 . assuming that the cooling is always efficient enough to evacuate the gravitational energy of the collapse , an hypothesis that will be confirmed a posteriori according to the virial masses considered , we can compute the density as a function of time by steps corresponding to the free - fall time @xmath53 of a given level @xmath54 of the hierarchy : @xmath55 .",
    "the h@xmath2 molecules are formed essentially through the h@xmath56h ( via h@xmath25 ) reaction at high redshift ( @xmath57 , shapiro & kang 1987 ) , then through the h@xmath58h reaction at @xmath59 ( hutchins 1976 ) , and through the 3-body reactions ( h@xmath60h@xmath60h ) at very high densities ( palla et al .",
    "the cooling at @xmath61k is essentially due to h@xmath2 . at low temperature ( @xmath62k )",
    ", the hd molecules can also intervene .",
    "the lih molecules are formed in too low quantities to be helpful ( stancil et al .",
    "1996 ) . in any case",
    ", this occurs at so high column densities that the h@xmath2 rotational lines are optically thick , which is not considered here .",
    "some results of the computations are displayed in fig .  1 , for @xmath63 and 50 .",
    "the horizontal full line indicates the virial temperature of the jeans mass at recombination , i.e. , @xmath64m@xmath1 . at @xmath65 ,",
    "the computed gas temperature is always lower than @xmath66 , and therefore the hypothesis of fragmentation is verified for all masses able to collapse .",
    "computations as a function of @xmath67 indicate that this is true for @xmath68 . for lower @xmath67 , only larger masses would fragment down the whole hierarchy , unless some metal enrichment has occurred through sporadic star formation before .",
    "_ therefore we have shown that a different hypothesis about the outcome of fragmentation leads to completely different results from tegmark et al .",
    "( 1997 ) concerning the amount of molecular hydrogen and the state of the bulk of the gas at redshifts @xmath69_.",
    "before significant star formation has occurred in the cold gas component , the medium is still dissipative and self - gravitating , and ideas on quasi - isothermal fragmentation can be applied ( de vega et al .",
    "the stability against sub - clumps merging ensues .",
    "this is opposite to the behaviour of dissipationless components , such as machos , stars or non - baryonic dark matter . in the latter case",
    ", it is assumed that as soon as a structure decouples from expansion , all the sub - structures already decoupled are washed out in a dynamical time through merging .",
    "this is due to violent relaxation and dynamical friction , that transfer the energy of relative orbital motions to the sub - structures themselves , and disrupt them ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ) . on the contrary , in a dissipative collapse and fragmentation process ,",
    "as soon as sub - structures coalesce , they form an entity larger than the jeans mass , and can re - fragment in a free - fall time , or dynamical time for this scale ( e.g. , pfenniger & combes 1994 ) . the fragmentation along the whole hierarchy of the jeans mass after recombination is almost instantaneous , as soon as the jeans mass has collapsed , as already noted by hoyle ( 1953 ) .",
    "the whole process takes only a small fraction of the collapse time - scale of the gmc at this epoch of @xmath70 1 myr .",
    "after recombination and re - heating , the formation of larger and larger objects is possible as long as the corresponding fluctuations become non - linear .",
    "the formation of galaxies could range from redshifts @xmath71 to the present according to their mass ( at redshift @xmath72 normal 10kpc - radius galaxies would overlap , cf .",
    "peebles 1980 ) .",
    "since the proto - galaxies contained mainly gas at the beginning , dissipation forms disks , and rotation support is provided by the angular momentum gained in tidal interactions .",
    "the proto - galaxy collapse is therefore a rather violent relaxation process , and the rate of star formation could be high ( and higher in the largest mass objects ) . in any case , the relaxation is much shorter and violent in the center of the collapsed objects . in the outer parts ,",
    "most of the mass can remain there in the form of self - gravitating cold gas , that has subsisted from its formation period before the reionization .",
    "when a substantial part of the mass has formed a stellar dissipationless component , the galaxy population enters the phase of hierarchical merging . according to their environment , and their tidal interactions with companions , galaxies evolve at different speeds toward the early - type side of the hubble sequence ( pfenniger , combes & martinet 1994 ) . when structures of the group - size turn around , further stellar activity peaks occur .",
    "later , the formation of clusters trigger again enhanced activity .",
    "clusters form around redshift @xmath36 , according to their mass , and to the cosmological model adopted .",
    "many are still assembling today , as is attested by the substructures observed .",
    "what happens then to the extended gas halos that still surround late - type galaxies ?",
    "they are very likely to be stripped , either through tidal interactions , or to ram - pressure when a substantial and dense hot intergalactic gas component has formed .",
    "already in the hi tracer , galaxies appear to be stripped in the center of clusters like virgo and coma ( e.g.  cayatte et al .",
    "some of the stripped gas is heated at the virial temperature of the cluster , and accounts for the huge amounts of gas mass detected in x - rays ( e.g.  david et al .",
    "but all the clumpuscules are not destroyed , and a multi - phase medium could survive in the igm ( ferland et al .  1994 ) , especially at the center of the cluster , where the cooling time is shorter than the dynamical time ( cooling flows ) , and the cold clumpuscules can reform . _ therefore the bulk of the baryonic mass detected in clusters in the form of x - ray gas is probably only a lower limit to the existing gas , and therefore to the amount of baryons . _",
    "we propose that just after recombination and decoupling , gaseous structures having the jeans mass , of the order of a giant molecular cloud of @xmath73m@xmath1 , collapse and fragment in the same time to form cold molecular clumpuscules .",
    "the fragmentation can proceed to masses down to jupiter masses , since the collapse is quasi - isothermal , due to the h@xmath2 cooling .",
    "the large majority of these pressure - supported fragments do not form stars , since they are in statistical equilibrium between coalescence and fragmentation , in a fractal structure , and in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic background temperature . a very low level , sporadic , star formation is sufficient to re - ionize the intergalactic gas at @xmath71 .",
    "the bulk of the clumpuscules survive the reionization , and may be assembled later on in larger structures , when proto - galaxies form .",
    "this scenario provides a way to avoid the  cooling \" catastrophy at large redshifts , that will produce much more stars that are observed today ( blanchard et al .",
    "it implies the existence of a large fraction of the dark matter around galaxies under the form of cold molecular gas ( also consistent with the recent x - ray results in clusters , david 1997 ) ."
