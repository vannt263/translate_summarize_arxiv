    "the interest in the ( 110 ) surfaces of mo and w has been fostered in recent years by the discovery of deep and extremely sharp indentations in the energy loss spectra of he atom scattering at h / mo(110 ) and h / w(110 )  @xcite . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fanom ] those anomalies are seen at an incommensurate wavevector , @xmath2 , along the @xmath3 $ ] direction ( @xmath4 ) and additionally at the commensurate wavevector @xmath5 at the boundary of the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) . at those points",
    "two simultaneous anomalies develop out of the ordinary rayleigh mode .",
    "one , @xmath6 , is extremely deep , and is only seen by helium atom scattering ( has )  @xcite .",
    "the other , @xmath7 , is instead modest , and is observed by both has and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ( hreels )  @xcite . since the @xmath3 $ ] components of both critical wavevectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 are approximately the same it was suggested that the anomaly runs parallel to @xmath10 through the sbz as illustrated in fig .  [ flocus ] .",
    "various models have been brought forward in order to account for the unusual vibrational properties of h - covered mo(110 ) and w(110 ) : for instance , a pronounced but less sharp softening of surface phonons is also seen on the ( 001 ) surfaces of w  @xcite and mo  @xcite . there , the effect is caused by marked nesting properties of the fermi surface  @xcite",
    ". however , angular resolved photoemission ( arp ) experiments of h / w(110 ) and h / mo(110 ) gave no evidence for nesting vectors comparable to the has determined critical wave vectors  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ ffermiexp ] ) .",
    "thus , for the phonon anomalies of those two systems there seems to be no connection between the electronic structure and the vibrational properties .",
    "moreover , even if such a relation existed it would be unclear whether the phenomena has to be interpreted as a kohn anomaly or as the phason and amplitudon modes associated with the occurance of a charge - density wave . in fact ,",
    "the experimental finding of two modes at @xmath11 as well as some theoretical arguments rule out the phason - amplitudon idea  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , any model which links the phonon anomalies to the motion of the hydrogen atoms  @xcite has to be ruled out because the has spectra remain practically unchanged when deuterium is adsorbed instead of hydrogen  @xcite .    still unexplained , but probably not directly correlated to the anomalies ,",
    "is the peculiar behavior of hydrogen vibrations observed in hreels experiments by balden _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . at a h - coverage of one mono - layer the adsorbate modes parallel to the surface form a continuum interpreted a liquid - like phase of the adsorbate .",
    "an additional puzzle to the already confusing picture is added by the observation of a symmetry loss in the low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) pattern of w(110 ) upon h - adsorption .",
    "the phenomena was believed being caused by a h - induced displacement of the top layer w atoms along the @xmath12 $ ] direction  @xcite ( see figs.[fstruc]b and c ) . for h / mo(110 )",
    "similar studies do not provide any evidence for a top - layer - shift reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "the goal of our work is to give a comprehensive explanation for the observed anomalous behavior and clarify the confusing picture drawn by the different experimental findings .",
    "we show that the anomalous behavior observed in the he and electron loss experiments is indeed governed by h - induced nesting features in the fermi surface .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , section  [ smeth ] gives a brief introduction into the _ ab initio _",
    "method used .",
    "the results of our work are presented in section  [ scalc ] : in subsection  [ satom ] we study the atomic geometry of the clean and h - covered mo(110 ) and w(110 ) surfaces .",
    "in particular , we check whether the hydrogen adsorption induces a top - layer - shift reconstruction . following in subsection  [ selec ]",
    ", we focus on the electronic structure of those surface systems . in this context",
    ", we are particularily interested in how the fermi surface changes upon h - adsorption : is there evidence for fermi - surface nesting ?",
    "if yes , how does it connect to the arp measurements of the fermi surfaces and the critical wavevectors detected by has and hreels ?",
    "along the same line within the model of a kohn anomaly , subsection  [ sphon ] digs into the coupling between electronic surface states and surface phonons .",
    "there , we discuss the mechanism which causes the small anomaly @xmath6 . in subsection  [ ssusc ]",
    "we examine the he scattering mechanism , study the spectrum of electron - hole excitations , and explain the physical nature of the huge anomalous branch @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the major aspects of our work are summarized in section  [ ssumm ] .",
    "the appendix presents several detailed test calculations giving an insight into the properties and the accuracy of our method .",
    "all our calculations employ the density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "they are performed within the framework of the local - density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation energy functional  @xcite . for the self - consistent solution of the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations we employ a full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) code  @xcite which we enhanced by the direct calculation of atomic forces  @xcite . combined with damped newton dynamics  @xcite this enables an efficient determination of fully relaxed atomic geometries",
    ". also , it allows the fast evaluation of phonon frequencies within a frozen - phonon approach .",
    "there exists a variety of different lapw programs  @xcite .",
    "we therefore briefly specify the main features of our code .",
    "this is also in order to clarify the meaning of the lapw parameters which determine the numerical accuracy of the calculations .    in the augmented plane - wave method space",
    "is divided into the interstitial region ( ir ) and non - overlapping muffin - tin ( mt ) spheres centered at the atomic sites  @xcite .",
    "this division accounts for the atomic - like character of the wavefunctions , the potential , and the electron density close to the nuclei and that the behavior of these quantities is smoother in between the atoms .",
    "the basis functions @xmath13 which we employ in our code for the expansion of the electron wavefunctions of the ks equation @xmath14 are defined as @xmath15y_{lm}(\\hat{r}_i ) } , & r_i \\le s_i \\quad . \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] here , @xmath16 denotes the sum of a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath17 and a vector @xmath18 within the first brillouin zone .",
    "the wavefunction cutoff @xmath19 limits the number of those @xmath20 vectors and thus the size of the basis set .",
    "the other symbols in eq.([ewfbas ] ) have the following meaning : @xmath21 is the unit cell volume , @xmath22 specifies the mt radius , and @xmath23 represents a vector within the mt sphere of the @xmath24-th atom . note that @xmath25 is a complex spherical harmonic with @xmath26 . the radial functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are solutions of the equations @xmath29 y_{lm}(\\hat{r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are regular at the origin . here",
    ", the ks operator @xmath30 contains only the spherical average of the effective potential within the respective mt .",
    "the expansion energies @xmath31 are chosen somewhere within the respective energy bands with @xmath32-character , whereas the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 are fixed by requiring that value and slope of the basis functions are continuous at the surface of the @xmath24-th mt sphere .",
    "obviously , this can only be fulfilled for @xmath35 , but as @xmath36 is typically high ( e.g. @xmath37 ) this does not represent a problem .    the representation of the potentials and densities resembles the one employed for the wavefunctions , i.e. , @xmath38 thus , no shape approximation is introduced .",
    "the quality of this full - potential description is controlled by the cutoff parameter @xmath39 for the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath17 and the maximum angular momentum @xmath40 of the @xmath41-representation inside the mts .",
    "the substrate surfaces are modeled by five- , seven- , and nine - layer slabs repeated periodically and separated by a vacuum region whose thickness is equivalent to four substrate layers .",
    "the mt radii for the w and mo atoms are chosen to be @xmath42 . note that the experimental interatomic distances of bulk mo and w are 2.73and 2.74 , respectively . for hydrogen the mt radius",
    "is set to @xmath43 .    in the case of the w surfaces the valence and semi - core electrons",
    "are treated scalar - relativistically while the core electrons are handled fully relativistically . for mo",
    "all calculations are done non - relativistically . in both metals",
    "we introduce a second energy window for the treatment of the semi - core electrons ( 4@xmath44 and 4@xmath45 for mo , 5@xmath44 and 5@xmath45 for w ) .",
    "the in - plane lattice constants ( compare fig .",
    "[ fstruc ] ) @xmath46  and @xmath47  are calculated to be without including zero - point vibrations .",
    "they are in good agreement with the respective measured bulk lattice parameters at room temperature and other theoretical results ( see appendix  [ abulk ] ) .    for the potential the @xmath41 representation within each mt sphere",
    "is taken up to @xmath48 while the kinetic - energy cutoff for the interstitial region is set to @xmath49ry .",
    "generally , we choose the plane - wave cutoff for the wavefunctions to be @xmath50ry ; only for the frozen - phonon calculations we use a slightly smaller cutoff of @xmath51ry which is indeed sufficient .",
    "the @xmath41 representation of the wavefunctions within the mts is taken up to @xmath52 .",
    "also , we employ fermi smearing with a broadening of @xmath53mev in order to stabilize the self - consistency and the @xmath54-summation .",
    "all energies given below are however extrapolations to zero temperature @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "we performed systematic tests comparing the lda and the generalized gradient approximation  @xcite exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "for the quantities reported in this paper ( total energy differences of different adsorption sites , bond lengths , etc . ) both treatments give practically the same results .",
    "all @xmath18 sets used were determined by using the special @xmath18 point scheme of monkhorst and pack  @xcite .",
    "also , we checked the @xmath54-point convergence : in the case of atomic and electronic structure calculations a two - dimensional uniform mesh of 64 @xmath54-points within the @xmath56 sbz gives stable results .",
    "for the evaluation of frozen - phonon energies a set of 56@xmath54-points is employed within the sbz of the enlarged @xmath57 and @xmath58 surface cells ( see subsection  [ sappphon ] ) . in table",
    "[ tparam ] we summarize the main features of our lapw parameter setting . for more details",
    "the reader is referred to the discussion in the appendix .        for some systems involving hydrogen",
    "the results of a total energy calculation are not reliable if the lda is used . in those cases the bonding  especially between hydrogen atoms  is only described accurately if gradient corrections are considered  @xcite . in table",
    "[ tfrozxc ] we compare results obtained with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite and those found within the lda .",
    "the latter is identical with the 56 @xmath59-point calculation in table  [ tfrozenerdiff ] .",
    "there , the xc potential of cepereley and alder  @xcite parametrized by perdew and zunger  @xcite is used .",
    "the small energy and force differences of 5mev and 8mev /  , respectively , clearly shows that our adsorbate systems are rather insensible to the xc formalism chosen ."
