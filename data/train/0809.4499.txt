    "the need for a coherent theory of physics and mathematics together arises from considerations of the basic relationship between physics and mathematics",
    ". why is mathematics relevant to physics @xcite .",
    "one way to see the problem is based on the widely held platonic view of mathematics .",
    "if mathematical systems have an abstract ideal existence outside of space and time and physics describes the property of systems in space and time , then why should the two be related at all ? yet it is clear that they are very closely related .",
    "the problem of the relationship between the foundations of mathematics and physics is not new .",
    "some recent work on the subject is described in@xcite and in @xcite .",
    "in particular the work of tegmark @xcite is is quite explicit in that it suggests that the physical universe is a mathematical universe .",
    "another approach to this problem is to work towards construction of a theory that treats physics and mathematics together as one coherent whole @xcite .",
    "such a theory would be expected to show why mathematics is so important to physics by describing details of the relation between mathematical and physical systems .    in this paper",
    "a possible approach to a coherent theory of physics and mathematics is described .",
    "the approach is based on the field of reference frames that follows from the properties of quantum mechanical representations of real and complex numbers @xcite .",
    "the use , here , of reference frames is similar in many ways to that used by different workers in areas of physics @xcite . in general",
    ", a reference frame provides a background or basis for descriptions of systems .",
    "in special relativity , reference frames for describing physical dynamics are based on choices of inertial coordinate systems . in quantum cryptography ,",
    "polarization directions are used to define reference frames for sending and receiving messages encoded in qubit string states .",
    "the use of reference frames here differs from those noted above in that the frames are not based on a preexisting space and time as a background .",
    "instead they are based on a mathematical parameterization of quantum theory representations of real and complex numbers . in particular , each frame @xmath0 in the field is based on a quantum theory representation , @xmath1 of the real and complex numbers where @xmath2 can be viewed as a set of equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of quantum states of qukit strings .",
    "@xmath3 is a set of pairs of these equivalence classes .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is the base ( @xmath5 for qubits ) , @xmath6 denotes a basis choice for the states of qukit strings that are values of rational numbers , and @xmath7 denotes an iteration stage .",
    "the existence of iterations follows from the observation that the representations of real and complex numbers are based on qukit string states .",
    "these are elements of a hilbert space that is itself defined as a vector space over a field of complex numbers .",
    "consequently one can use the real and complex numbers constructed in a stage @xmath7 frame as the base of a stage @xmath8 frame .",
    "each reference frame contains a considerable number of mathematical structures .",
    "besides @xmath2 and @xmath9 a frame @xmath0 contains representations of all mathematical systems that can be described as structures based on @xmath2 and @xmath10 however frames do not contain physical theories as mathematical structures based on @xmath11 the reason is that the frames do not contain any representations of space and time .",
    "the goal of this paper is to take a first step in remedying this defect by expansion of the domain of each frame to include discrete space and time lattices .",
    "the lattices , @xmath12 in a frame , @xmath13 are such that the number of points in each dimension is given by @xmath14 the spacing @xmath15 and @xmath16 for each lattice , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are fixed with @xmath17 an arbitrary nonnegative integer .",
    "it follows that each dimension component of the location of each point in a lattice is a rational number expressible as a finite string of base @xmath19 digits .",
    "representations of physical systems of different types are also present in each frame . however , the emphasis here is on strings of qukits , @xmath20 present in each frame .",
    "these strings are considered to be hybrid systems in that they are both physical systems and mathematical systems . as mathematical systems , the quantum states of each string , in some basis ,",
    "represent a set of rational numbers .",
    "as physical systems the motion of strings in a frame is described relative to a space and time lattice in the frame .",
    "this dual role is somewhat similar to the concept that information is physical @xcite .",
    "considerable space in the paper is devoted to how observers in a stage @xmath21 ( parent ) frame view the contents of a stage @xmath7 frame .",
    "for an observer , @xmath22 in a frame @xmath0 the numbers in the real and complex number base of the frame are abstract and have no structure .",
    "the only requirement is that they satisfy the set of axioms for real or complex number systems .",
    "points of lattices @xmath23 in the frame are also regarded as abstract and without structure .",
    "the only requirement is that the lattices satisfy some relevant geometric axioms .    the view of the contents of a stage @xmath7 frame as seen by an observer @xmath24 in a stage @xmath21 frame , @xmath25 is quite different .",
    "elements of the stage @xmath7 frame that @xmath26 sees as abstract and with no structure , are seen by @xmath27 to have structure .",
    "numbers in @xmath2 are seen by @xmath27 to be equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of stage @xmath21 hybrid systems .",
    "space points of stage @xmath7 lattices with @xmath28 space and one time dimension are seen in a stage j-1 frame to be @xmath28 tuples of hybrid systems with the location of each point given by a state of the @xmath28 tuple .",
    "time points are seen to be hybrid systems whose states correspond to the possible lattice time values .",
    "all this and more is discussed in the rest of the paper .",
    "the next section is a brief summary of quantum theory representations and the resulting frame fields @xcite .",
    "section [ pfctpm ] describes a possible approach to a coherent theory of physics and mathematics as the inclusion of space and time lattices in each frame of the frame field .",
    "properties of the lattices in the frames are described .",
    "qukit strings as hybrid systems are discussed in the next section .",
    "their mathematical properties as rational number systems with states as values of rational numbers are described . also included is a general hamiltonian description of the rational number states as energy eigenvalues and a schrdinger equation description of the dynamics of these systems .",
    "section [ fevpf ] describes frame entities as viewed from a parent frame .",
    "included is a description of real and complex numbers , quantum states and hilbert spaces , and space and time lattices .",
    "section [ lhs ] discusses in more detail a stage @xmath21 views of stage @xmath7 lattice points and locations as tuples of hybrid systems and point locations as states of the tuples .",
    "dynamics of these tuples in stage @xmath21 is briefly described as is the parent frame view of the dynamics of physical systems in general .",
    "the last section is a discussion of several points .",
    "the most important one is that frame field description given here leads to a field of different descriptions of the physical universe , one for each frame , whereas there is just one .",
    "this leads to the need to find some way to merge or collapse the frame field to correspond to the accepted view of the physical universe .",
    "this is discussed in the section as are some other points .",
    "whatever one thinks of the ideas and systems described in this work , it is good to keep the following points in mind .",
    "one point is that the existence of the reference frame field is based on properties of states of qukit string systems representing values of rational numbers .",
    "however the presence of a frame field is more general in that it is not limited to states of qukit strings .",
    "reference frame fields arise for any quantum representation of rational numbers where the values of the rational numbers , as states of some system , are elements of a vector space over the field of complex numbers .",
    "another point is that the three dimensional reference frame field described here exists only for quantum theory representations of the natural numbers , the integers , and the rational numbers . neither the basis degree of freedom @xmath6 , nor the iteration stages , @xmath29 are present in classical representations .",
    "this is the case even for classical representations based on base @xmath19 digit or kit strings .",
    "the reason is that states of digit strings are not elements of a vector space over a complex number field .    finally ,",
    "although understandable , it is somewhat of a mystery why so much effort in physics has gone into the description of various aspects of quantum geometry and space time and so little into quantum representations of numbers .",
    "this is especially the case when one considers that natural numbers , integers , rational numbers , and probably real and complex numbers , are even more fundamental to physics than is geometry .",
    "in earlier work @xcite quantum theory representations of natural numbers @xmath30 , integers @xmath31 , and rational numbers @xmath32 , were described by states of finite length qukit strings that include one qubit . to keep the description as simple as possible ,",
    "the strings are considered to be finite sets of qukits and one qubit with the qukits and qubit parameterized by integer labels .",
    "the natural ordering of the integers serves to order the set into a string .",
    "this purely mathematical representation of qukit strings makes no use of physical representation of qukit strings as extended systems in space and/or time .",
    "physical representations are described later on in section [ qsshs ] after the introduction of space and time lattices into each frame of the frame field .    the qukit ( @xmath33 ) string states are given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a @xmath36 valued function with domain @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes the sign",
    ". the string location of the sign qubit is given by @xmath18 where @xmath39 @xmath17 is any nonnegative integer .",
    "this expresses the range of possible locations of the sign qubit from one end of the string to the other . by convention",
    "@xmath40 has the sign qubit at the right end of the string , @xmath41 at the left end .",
    "the qubit can occupy the same integer location as a qukit .",
    "the reason for the subscript @xmath6 will be clarified later on .",
    "a compact notation is used where the location @xmath18 of the sign qubit is also the location of the @xmath42 point . as examples ,",
    "the base @xmath43 numbers @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 are represented here by @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 respectively .",
    "strings are characterized by the values of @xmath50 for each @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath18 the string states @xmath34 give a unified quantum theory representation of natural numbers and integers in @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 for numbers in @xmath56 @xmath57 ; for numbers in @xmath58 , @xmath59 and there are no restrictions for @xmath55 here @xmath60 is the set of rational numbers expressible as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is any integer whose absolute value is @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the set of nonnegative integers in @xmath67 the correspondence between the numbers @xmath61 and the states @xmath34 is given by the observation that each @xmath35 corresponds to an integer @xmath68 also , as noted , @xmath18 is the location of the @xmath42 point measured from the right end of the string .    since one is dealing with quantum states of qukit strings , states with leading and trailing",
    "@xmath69 are included . in this case",
    "there are many states that are all arithmetically equal even though they are orthogonal quantum mechanically .",
    "for example @xmath70 even though the two states are orthogonal .",
    "the set of states so defined form a basis set that spans a fock space @xmath71 of states .",
    "a fock space is used because the basis set includes states of @xmath33 strings of different lengths .",
    "linear superposition states in the space have the form@xmath72 the @xmath17 and @xmath18 sums are over all positive integers and from @xmath73 to @xmath17 , and the @xmath35 sum is over all functions with domain @xmath74.$ ]    as already noted , the states @xmath34 of @xmath33 strings are values of rational numbers .",
    "quantum mechanically they also represent a basis choice of states in the fock space @xmath75 however the choice of a basis is arbitrary in that there are an infinite number of possible choices . here",
    "the choice of a basis is parameterized by the variable @xmath76 since choice of a basis is equivalent to fixing a gauge , @xmath6 is also a gauge fixing parameter .",
    "one can also describe gauge and base transformation operators on these states .",
    "gauge transformations correspond to a basis change ( @xmath6 to @xmath77 ) and base transformations correspond to a base change ( @xmath19 to @xmath78 ) .",
    "details are given in @xcite .",
    "quantum theory representations of real numbers are defined here as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of finite @xmath33 strings that are values of rational numbers .",
    "let @xmath79 be a function on the natural numbers such that for each @xmath80 @xmath81 is a basis state : @xmath82 for each @xmath80 the interval @xmath83 $ ] is the domain of @xmath84    the sequence @xmath79 is a cauchy sequence if it satisfies the cauchy condition:@xmath85    here @xmath86 is the basis state that is the base @xmath19 arithmetic absolute value of the state resulting from the arithmetic subtraction of @xmath87 from @xmath88 the cauchy condition says that this state is arithmetically less than or equal to the state @xmath89}1_{-\\ell}\\rangle_{k , g}$ ] for all @xmath90 greater than some @xmath91 . here @xmath92 is a string state that represents the number @xmath93 the subscripts @xmath94 in the definition of the cauchy condition indicate that the operations are arithmetic and are defined for base @xmath19 string states in the gauge @xmath6 .",
    "they are _ not _ the usual quantum theory operations .    the definition can be extended to sequences @xmath79 of linear superpositions of basis states . in this case one",
    "defines a probability @xmath95 as a sum over all components of @xmath96 and @xmath87 that satisfy the second line of eq .",
    "[ cauchy ] .",
    "the state @xmath79 is cauchy if the probability @xmath97 where@xmath98    two sequences @xmath79 and @xmath99 are equivalent , @xmath100 if the sequence defined by the termwise arithmetic difference of @xmath79 and @xmath99 converges to @xmath73 .",
    "the specific condition for this is expressed by eq .",
    "[ cauchy ] if one replaces @xmath87 with @xmath101 the relation @xmath102 is used to define equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of @xmath33 string states .",
    "the set of these equivalence classes is a quantum theory representation @xmath103 of the real numbers .",
    "quantum equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states are larger than classical equivalence classes because each quantum equivalence class contains many sequences of states that have no classical correspondent .",
    "however no new equivalence classes appear .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that each quantum equivalence class contains a basis valued sequence that corresponds to a classical sequence of finite base @xmath19 digit strings .",
    "one can also define a canonical representation of each equivalence class as a sequence @xmath81 of basis states such that if @xmath104 then @xmath81 is an initial part of @xmath105 this is similar to the usual classical canonical representation of an equivalence class of real numbers as an infinite string of digits with a @xmath42 point .",
    "the quantum representation would be an infinite string of qukits with each qukit in one of @xmath19 basis states .",
    "extension of the above to include quantum representations of complex numbers is straightforward .",
    "one method represents complex rational numbers by pairs of states of finite @xmath33 strings .",
    "this what is actually done in computations involving complex numbers .",
    "the state components of the pair represent values of real and imaginary rational numbers .",
    "cauchy sequences of these state pairs are defined by applying the cauchy condition separately to the component sequences of real rational number states and imaginary rational number states",
    ". two cauchy sequences @xmath79 and @xmath99 of state pairs are equivalent , @xmath100 if the termwise arithmetic differences of the real parts , @xmath106 and of the imaginary parts , @xmath107 each converge to @xmath108 the resulting set of equivalence classes of cauchy sequences is a quantum theory representation of the set of complex numbers .",
    "quantum theory representations of real and complex numbers differ from classical representations in two important ways .",
    "one is the presence of the gauge freedom or basis choice freedom .",
    "this is indicated by the @xmath6 subscript in @xmath109    the other difference is based on the observation that states of qukit strings are elements of a hilbert space or a fock space . from a mathematical point of view",
    "these spaces are vector spaces over the fields of real and complex numbers .",
    "it follows from what has been shown that @xmath33 string states , as elements of a vector space over the field of real and complex numbers , can be used to construct other representations of real and complex numbers .",
    "this suggests the possibility of iteration of the construction described here as the quantum representations of real and complex numbers can in turn be used as the base of hilbert and fock spaces for a repeated construction . here",
    "the iteration stage is another degree of freedom for the frame field .",
    "the third degree of freedom arises from the free choice of the base choice for the humber representation .",
    "this choice , denoted by the @xmath19 subscript , is common to both quantum and classical representations .",
    "these three degrees of freedom can be combined to describe a three dimensional reference frame field .",
    "each reference frame @xmath0 is based on a quantum representation @xmath110 of the real and complex numbers .",
    "the subscripts denote the iteration stage @xmath7 , the base @xmath19 , and the gauge @xmath6 .",
    "each reference frame contains representations of hilbert and fock spaces as mathematical structures over @xmath11    because the iteration degree of freedom is directed , it is useful to use genealogical terms to describe the iteration stages",
    ". frames that are ancestors to a given frame @xmath0 occur at stages @xmath111 where @xmath112 frames that are descendants occur at stages @xmath111 where @xmath113    from a mathematical point of view there are several possibilities for the stages : the frame fields can have a finite number of stages with both a common ancestor frame and a set of terminal frames .",
    "the fields can also be one way infinite with either a common ancestor and no terminal stage , or with a terminal stage and no common ancestor ; or they can be two way infinite",
    ". they can also be cyclic .",
    "these last two cases have no common ancestor or terminal frames .",
    "another way to illustrate the frame field structure is to show , schematically , frames emanating from frames .",
    "figure [ pactpm2 ] illustrates a slice of the frame field for a fixed value of @xmath114 each point @xmath115 in the @xmath116 plane denotes a reference frame @xmath117 at the next iteration stage with @xmath118 as its real and complex number base .",
    "three different viewpoints of the real and complex numbers as frame bases are of use here .",
    "@xmath110 is a view from outside the frame field that denotes the position of the numbers with respect to the field degrees of freedom . to an observer inside @xmath0",
    "the elements of @xmath110 are seen as external , abstract , featureless elements .",
    "they have no structure other than that which follows from the requirement that they satisfy the axioms for real and complex numbers .",
    "this assumption is made because it is the view held , at least implicitly by physicists .",
    "it also corresponds to how numbers are treated in physical theories .",
    "the only properties of numbers relevant to theories are those derived from the appropriate axioms .",
    "an observer in a parent frame @xmath119 sees the elements of @xmath110 as having structure .",
    "they are seen as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of finite @xmath33 strings .",
    "this is in addition to their having properties derived from the relevant axiom sets .",
    "the main consideration of this paper is the proposed use of the reference frame field as a possible approach to a coherent theory of physics and mathematics .",
    "this ensures that quantum theory representations of natural numbers , integers , rational numbers , and real and complex numbers will play a basic role in the theory .",
    "so far the reference frames contain mathematical systems .",
    "these include quantum theory representations of numbers , qukit strings , and representations of other mathematical systems as structures based on the different types of numbers .",
    "physical theories and systems are not present in the frames .",
    "the reason is that there are no representatios of space and time in the frames .",
    "these are needed for theories to describe the kinematics and dynamics of systems moving in space and time .",
    "this must be remedied if the frame field is to be an approach to a coherent theory .",
    "one way to fix this is to expand the domains of the frames to include physical systems and descriptions of their dynamics .",
    "a first step in this direction is to expand the domain of each frame in the field to include discrete lattices of space and time .",
    "the reason for working with discrete instead of continuum space and time will be noted later .    to be more specific , each frame",
    "@xmath0 includes a set @xmath120 of space and time lattices .",

    ", the number @xmath122 of points and spacing @xmath123 in each of the @xmath28 space dimensions and the time dimension will be assumed to be the same .",
    "it should be noted that , to an observer in a frame , the points in each space and time lattice in a frame _ are _ ( emphasis on `` are '' ) points of space and time relative to that frame .",
    "they are not merely mathematical representations or descriptions of some external space and time . in addition",
    "an observer in a frame sees the points of space and time lattices in in the frame as abstract , featureless points with no structure .",
    "the only requirement is that the lattices should satisfy appropriate geometrical axioms .",
    "a restriction on the lattices in frames is that the values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 for each space and time lattice in the set @xmath120 are given by @xmath124 here @xmath17 is an arbitrary nonnegative integer , @xmath125 and @xmath19 is the same integer @xmath126 that is the @xmath19 subscript in the frame label , as in @xmath127 because of this restriction the lattices @xmath121 will be labeled from now on as @xmath128 based on eq .",

    "an example of such a sequence is given by setting @xmath133 $ ] and increasing @xmath17 without bound .",

    "so far each frame contains in its domain , space and time lattices , and strings of qukits that are numbers .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that it also contains various types of physical systems . for the purposes of this paper",
    "the types of included physical systems do not play an important role as the main emphasis here is on qukit string systems . also in this first paper descriptions of system dynamics will be limited to nonrelativistic dynamics .",
    "it follows from this that each frame includes a description of the dynamics of physical systems based on the space and time lattices in the frame .",
    "the kinematics and dynamics of the systems are expressed by theories that are present in the frame as mathematical structures over the real and complex number base of the frame .",
    "this is the case irrespective of whether the physical systems are particles , fields , or strings , or have any other form .",
    "one reason space and time are described as discrete lattices instead of as continua is that it is not clear what the appropriate limit of the discrete description is .",
    "as is well known , there are many different descriptions of space and time that are present in the literature .",
    "the majority of these descriptions arise from the need to combine quantum mechanics with general relativity .",
    "they include use of various quantum geometries @xcite , and space time as a foam @xcite and as a spin network as in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "these are in addition to the often used assumption of a fixed flat space and time continuum that serves as a background arena for the dynamics of all physical systems , from cosmological to microscopic .",
    "space and time may also be emergent in an asymptotic sense @xcite .",
    "the fact that there are many different lattices in a frame each characterized by different values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and that each can serve as a background space and time is not a problem .",
    "this is no different than the fact that one can use many different space and time lattices with different spacings and numbers of points to describe discrete dynamics of systems .",
    "so far the domain of each frame contains space and time lattices , many types of physical systems ( such as electrons , nuclei , atoms , etc . ) and physical theories as mathematical structures based on the real and complex numbers .",
    "these describe the kinematics and dynamics of these systems on the lattices .",
    "also included are qukit strings .",
    "states of these strings were seen to be values of rational numbers .",

    "here it is proposed to consider these strings as systems that can either be numbers , i.e. mathematical systems , or they can be physical systems . because of this dual role , they are referred to as hybrid systems . as such they will be seen to play an important role .",
    "support for this proposal is based on the observation that the description of qukit strings as both numbers and physical systems is not much different than the usual view in physics regarding qubits and strings of qubits . as a unit of quantum information",
    ", the states of a qubit can be @xmath135 and @xmath136 which denote single digit binary numbers .",
    "the states can also be @xmath137 as spin projection states of a physical spin @xmath138 system . in the same way strings of qubits are binary numbers in quantum computation , or they can represent physical systems such as spins or atoms in a linear ion trap @xcite . to be blunt about it , ``",
    "information is physical '' @xcite , and information is mathematical .",
    "also it is reasonable to expect that the domain of a coherent theory of physics and mathematics together would contain systems that are both mathematical systems and physical systems .",

    "for example a physical system of a certain type is a proton , not a proton system .",

    "as was noted , the states of the @xmath139 systems in a frame @xmath0 are elements of a hilbert space @xmath151 in the frame .",

    "one might expect such a theory to contain systems that can be either physical systems or mathematical systems .",
    "the use of massive hybrid systems to be stage @xmath21 frame images of points of space and time lattices in stage @xmath7 frames suggests that there must be different types of hybrid systems .",

    "recall that the notion of a point in a lattice is separated from the location of the point just as the notion of a number , as a mathematical system , is separated from the value of a number .",
    "this use of number and number value is different from the usual use in mathematics in that expressions , as @xmath318 are usually considered as rational numbers and not as values of rational numbers . here a rational number , as a hybrid system , is similar to the usual mathematical concept of a set of rational numbers as a model of the rational number axioms .    in conclusion , it is worth reiterating the last paragraphs at the end of the introduction .",
    "whatever one thinks of the ideas presented in the paper , the following points should be kept in mind .",
    "two of the three dimensions of the field of reference frames are present only for quantum theory representations of the real and complex numbers .",
    "these are the gauge or basis degree of freedom and the iteration stage degree of freedom .",
    "they are not present in classical descriptions .",
    "the number base degree of freedom is present for both quantum and classical representations based on rational number representations by digit strings .",
    "the presence of the gauge and iteration degrees of freedom in the quantum representation described here is independent of the description of rational number values as states of qukit string systems .",
    "any quantum representation of the rational numbers , such as states @xmath319 of integer pairs , where the states are elements of a vector space will result in a frame field with gauge and iteration degrees of freedom .    finally , the importance of numbers to physics and mathematics should be emphasized .",
    "it is hoped that more work on combining quantum physics and the quantum theory of numbers will be done .",
    "the need for this is based on the observation that natural numbers , integers , rational numbers , and probably real and complex numbers , are even more fundamental to physics than is geometry .",
