    "the boson star becomes an ordinary homogeneous condensate , with @xmath175 .",
    "we now turn to the study of nonzero temperature . as discussed in section [ grand ] , thermodynamic consistency strictly requires @xmath176 which implies @xmath177 owing to ( [ chi0 ] ) .",

    "this implies that the function @xmath142 never reaches a maximum .",
    "thus , equation ( [ dphidr ] ) with ( [ dm])-([dchi ] ) possesses no soliton solution if @xmath177 , and at any temperature @xmath184 , the only physically acceptable solution , would be the trivial one @xmath185 .",
    "it seems that , in contrast to the self - gravitating fermion gas @xcite , a self - gravitating boson gas does not possess a nontrivial limiting configuration as @xmath186 .",
    "moreover , if we hold @xmath8 fixed and decrease the temperature sticking to @xmath176 , i.e. , @xmath187 , @xmath7 will increase until we reach a limiting temperature @xmath0 for which @xmath188 .",
    "further decrease of @xmath107 with fixed @xmath8 is no longer possible unless a condensation process takes place .",
    "if there were no gravity , we would decrease the temperature below @xmath0 keeping @xmath189 . as a result ,",
    "the thermal density of particles would decrease and the density of particles in the ground state would adequately increase forming a homogeneous bose - einstein condensate @xmath190 . in that process , the total number of particles would remain fixed .    in the presence of gravity ,",
    "the formation of a homogeneous condensate is not possible since @xmath191 is not a solution to ( [ dphidr ] ) .",
    "however , a condensation process will take place if below @xmath192 the formation of a soliton is made possible by allowing @xmath193 .",
    "this implies that the chemical potential at infinity @xmath7 is less than @xmath59 , although the local chemical potential at the origin @xmath194 stays equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for this apparent thermodynamic inconsistency lies in the fact that general relativity does not allow configurations with asymptotically constant matter density .",
    "of course , in the limit @xmath171 , the soliton solution would become an ordinary homogeneous condensate , with @xmath195 , as in the @xmath196 case discussed above .",
    "in numerical calculations we shall stick to the condition @xmath188 below @xmath197 .",
    "this condition , which prevents the bose - einstein distribution from becoming negative , fixes @xmath198 for @xmath193 , and @xmath176 for @xmath199 .",
    "to proceed with the numerics , we have to specify the radius @xmath5 .",
    "although @xmath5 is an arbitrary parameter , the following physical considerations will give us its preferable order of magnitude .",
    "first , the size of the system is clearly much larger than the size that it would assume at zero temperature , i.e. , @xmath5 must be larger than the radius of a boson star @xmath200 .",
    "second , it should be smaller or at most of the order of the size it would take as a gas at high temperatures . to estimate the natural size of the purely gaseous phase , note that if the condensate vanishes , the quantities @xmath201 and @xmath137 may be rescaled so that the dimensionless field equations remain in the same form as in ( [ dm])-([dchi ] ) with @xmath202 and @xmath203 replaced by @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively , and with @xmath137 and @xmath201 measured in units of @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "thus , the natural size of a purely gaseous phase is of the order @xmath206 and therefore we expect the radius of our system to be in the range @xmath208 @xmath206 .",
    "now suppose that at an early stage of the universe evolution , when the temperature is high , say @xmath107 @xmath2 , a gravitating boson ensemble exists in a purely gaseous phase with the particle - number density of the order @xmath209 within a volume of large radius @xmath210 . during the cooling down to temperatures @xmath211 the condensation will take place , in which a number of boson stars will be formed .",
    "during this evolution the particle number @xmath212 is conserved . since",
    "a typical particle number in a boson star is of the order @xmath141 , the number of boson stars formed in the condensation process is approximately @xmath213 therefore , the volume occupied by each of the boson stars is of the order @xmath214 and the corresponding radius of the order @xmath215 this quantity is much larger than the radius @xmath169 of the boson star itself , so the condensate will occupy only a small portion of the volume @xmath216 . at @xmath217 , the thermal contribution to",
    "the particle number is @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , the contributions to the total charge of the thermal part and of the condensate are of the same order of magnitude despite the apparent incommensurability of the two densities in ( [ ntil ] ) .",
    "to integrate equations ( [ dphidr])-([dn ] ) numerically , we take the radius of the system as @xmath219 , in accordance with ( [ r ] ) , and , for definiteness , we take the mass of the boson as @xmath220 .",
    "the choice of @xmath2 will practically not affect our results as long as @xmath221 .    for given @xmath159 , the initial values @xmath154 and @xmath153 that yield the ground - state ( zero - node ) solution with the required particle number are not always uniquely determined .",
    "the reason is that , owing to general - relativistic effects , there exists a finite @xmath154 for which @xmath8 and @xmath3 reach a maximum .",
    "this limiting configuration is similar to the oppenheimer - volkoff limit for the degenerate fermion stars .",
    "further increase of @xmath154 makes @xmath8 oscillate about a nonzero limiting value @xmath222 that corresponds to the infinite central density . in fig .",
    "[ n _ ] we plot the particle number @xmath8 versus @xmath154 for various @xmath159 , including @xmath223 which corresponds to zero temperature .",
    "it is clear that for each @xmath159 there will be at least two configurations with the same @xmath8 , if @xmath8 is slightly below the maximum .",
    "however , the configurations represented by the points on the right of the maximum on each curve are thermodynamically unstable since their free energy , as we shall shortly see , is larger than the free energy of the corresponding configurations on the left of the maximum .",
    "therefore , if we restrict our consideration to stable configurations , the quantities @xmath154 and @xmath153 will be uniquely determined .",

    "[ mu _ ] we also give the discussed approximate analytical result for a free boson system .",

    "second , the functions describing the temperature dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath194 for @xmath244 are almost exactly the same .",
    "the reason for both effects is that @xmath245 in a purely gaseous phase is practically constant on the interval @xmath158 .",
    "the departure of the analytical result for a free boson system from the numerical result for a gravitating boson system is a general - relativistic effect below @xmath197 , and above @xmath197 is just due to the high - temperature approximation .",
    "our results depicted in figs .  [ n_]-[mu0 _ ] depend , of course , on the choice of @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , as in the case of a free gas , the critical temperature should not depend on @xmath5 nor on @xmath8 if the average density is kept fixed .",
    "we have checked that , if we keep the ratio @xmath246 fixed , our @xmath197 remains constant to very high accuracy with @xmath5 varying by several orders of magnitude .",
    "so far , we have studied the condensation process assuming @xmath221 , i.e. , @xmath247 .",
    "now , let us investigate an extreme general - relativistic case when the value of the boson mass is a sizable fraction of the planck mass , say @xmath248 , yielding @xmath249 .",
    "in this case , the natural length scale @xmath250 of the purely thermal phase becomes comparable with the natural size @xmath239 of the mixed phase , and we expect large gravitational effects .    the calculations are presented in figs .",
    "[ fn _ ] and [ sn _ ] in which , respectively , the free energy and entropy are shown as functions of temperature for @xmath249 and @xmath251 . the part of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fn _ ] that starts from @xmath196 , makes the loop , and ends at the sharp cusp , represents the mixed soliton - gas phase .",
    "the rest of the curve , which can be continuously extended to high temperatures , represents the purely gaseous phase .",
    "in the temperature interval @xmath252 there are three distinct solutions of which only two are physical , namely , those for which the free energy assumes a minimum .",
    "the cusp corresponds to the naive transition point .",
    "however , the actual transition takes place at the temperature @xmath197 , where the free energy of the mixed phase and that of the gas become equal .",
    "hence , it is a first - order phase transition .",
    "the dotted curves in figs .",
    "[ fn _ ] and [ sn _ ] represent the physically unstable solution . in our example",
    ", the transition temperature is @xmath253 , as indicated in the plots by the dashed line .",
    "the latent heat per particle released during the phase transition is given by the entropy difference at the point of discontinuity @xmath254 this phase transition is similar to the gravitational phase transition in self - gravitating fermionic systems @xcite , with one important distinction : in a gravitating bosonic system the phase transition is first order only in the extreme general - relativistic regime , whereas in gravitating fermionic systems it remains first order even in the newtonian regime @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have studied a canonical system of self - gravitating bosons at finite temperature in a general - relativistic framework .",
    "we have numerically solved the system of self - consistency equations consisting of a klein - gordon equation coupled to einstein field equations and the equation of state for a gravitating boson gas .",
    "we have investigated the circumstances under which this system undergoes a bose - einstein condensation .",
    "this condensation is quite distinct from the usual one in that it involves the formation of a soliton with the spherically symmetric matter distribution concentrated around the origin , as opposed to the usual spatially homogeneous bose - einstein condensate . in the @xmath186 limit ,",
    "the soliton becomes a mini boson star .",
    "the condensation begins with a second order phase transition at the critical temperature @xmath197 .",
    "the system exists in two phases : a gaseous phase above @xmath197 and the mixed soliton - gas phase below @xmath255 .",
    "the critical temperature is approximately proportional to the square root of the average particle - number density and is very close the the corresponding critical temperature of a free boson gas .",
    "general relativistic effects become important when the boson mass is a few orders of magnitude away from the planck mass . in that case , the condensation begins with a first - order phase transition that qualitatively resembles the gravitational phase transition of fermionic matter .",
