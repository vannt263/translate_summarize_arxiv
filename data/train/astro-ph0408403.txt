    "pg1402 + 261  is a type - i radio - quiet quasar at z=0.164 @xcite .",
    "it emits narrow optical permitted lines with fhwm ( h@xmath8)=1910kms@xmath1 and can also be classified as a narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) , which are defined to have fwhm ( h@xmath8)@xmath9kms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the mass of the supermassive black hole in this quasar has been estimated to be 2@xmath1010@xmath11m@xmath12 and the bolometric luminosity is about 1.3@xmath1010@xmath13ergs@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a high accretion rate relative to eddington of about 50@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "pg1402 + 261  was previously observed in x - rays with _ beppo - sax _  by @xcite .",
    "they found that the data were satisfactorily represented by a broken power law continuum of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the soft and hard x - ray bands , respectively , although there was some evidence for an excess of counts above 7  kev in the mecs spectrum .",
    "a preliminary analysis of a recent ( 2002 ) xmm - newton observation of pg1402 + 261 , reported by @xcite among a sample of pg quasars , shows that the spectrum can not be represented by a simple broken power - law continuum alone , but exhibits a large deviation between @xmath0  kev in the quasar rest frame , in the form of an apparent broad and blue - shifted iron k emission line .",
    "this observation adds to the number of agn ( and nls1s in particular ) that appear to exhibit unusually strong emission or absorption features above 7 kev in the iron k - shell band ; e.g. 1h  0707 - 495 @xcite , iras  13224 - 3809 @xcite , pds  456 @xcite and pg  1211 + 143 @xcite .",
    "these iron k band features have either been interpreted as the signature of enhanced reflection from the inner accretion disk , e.g. 1h  0707 - 495 @xcite but in some cases may also be interpreted as evidence for an additional high column density absorber , either from matter partially covering the x - ray source @xcite or even from a high velocity ( @xmath17 ) outflow @xcite .    here",
    "we present a spectral analysis of the _ xmm - newton _  observation of pg1402 + 261 , modeling the strong iron k - band emission ( or absorption ) feature .",
    "we investigate the possible physical origins for this feature ; either in the form of an extreme broadened iron emission line produced via x - ray reflection from accretion disk or alternatively a very high column density ionized absorber .",
    "note that all fit parameters are given in the quasar rest frame , with values of h@xmath18=75kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 , and q@xmath18=0.5 assumed throughout .",
    "errors are quoted at 90% confidence ( e.g. @xmath19 , for 1 parameter of interest ) .",
    "pg1402 + 261  was observed by _ xmm - newton _  on 2002 february 27 ( obsid : 0109081001 ) , with an exposure time of only 9.1ks .",
    "data were taken with the epic pn and mos ccds @xcite , in large window mode with the thin filter .",
    "the data was reduced using version 5.4.1 of the xmm - sas software .",
    "data were selected using event patterns 0 - 4 and 0 - 12 for pn and mos respectively , whilst only good x - ray events ( with ` flag=0 ' ) were included .",
    "the source spectra were extracted from a circular source region of @xmath20  radius , whilst background spectra were extracted from a box of 1.85  radius around the source , but excluding the circular source region .",
    "response matrices and ancillary response files were generated using the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen respectively .",
    "epic - pn lightcurves were also extracted over two energy bands , however no dramatic variability was observed , therefore the spectral analysis is performed on the whole _",
    "xmm - newton _  exposure .",
    "in all subsequent fits , the column density is fixed to the galactic value , i.e , 1.47 @xmath10 10@xmath21@xmath6 .",
    "both the epic - pn and the co - added mos spectra are shown in figure  1 , with the data / model ratio residuals plotted against a power - law continuum of photon index @xmath22 fitted in the @xmath23  kev band .",
    "a strong soft excess is present below 2 kev and the continuum shape can be parameterized by a simple broken power - law , with a soft index of @xmath24 and a hard index of @xmath25 above a break energy of @xmath26  kev .",
    "a hard excess is also clearly observed above 5 kev in both the pn and mos detectors .",
    "for this broken - powerlaw continuum , the unabsorbed 0.310kev",
    "( 210kev ) band flux is 7.3@xmath1010@xmath27erg@xmath6s@xmath1 ( 1.8@xmath1010@xmath27erg@xmath6s@xmath1 ) , with a corresponding luminosity of 4.4@xmath1010@xmath28ergs@xmath1 ( 1.0@xmath1010@xmath28ergs@xmath1 ) . about 77@xmath14 of the flux",
    "is emitted below 2kev , consistent with the strong soft x - ray excess .",
    "note that at this flux level , photon pile - up of the source x - ray spectrum is negligible .",
    "+ as the pn spectrum contains significantly more counts than the mos above 6 kev in the iron k band , we now concentrate on the pn spectral analysis .",
    "figure 2 shows the data / model ratio to the broken - power - law continuum , plotted from 3 - 11 kev in the quasar rest frame .",
    "notice that the majority of the flux of the iron k band feature is observed above 7 kev , i.e. above the rest energy for h - like iron , whilst a sharp drop in the spectrum is observed at 9 kev in the rest frame .",
    "a single broad gaussian emission line models the hard excess rather well , with a centroid energy of @xmath29  kev , a line width of @xmath30  kev ( fwhm velocity of @xmath31  km  s@xmath1 ) and a very high equivalent width of @xmath32  kev .",
    "the fit statistic is acceptable , with @xmath33 ( where dof is the number od degrees of freedom ) , with the feature detected at @xmath34 significance according to an f - test , whilst the line centroid is formally consistent with emission from hydrogen like iron ( at 6.97 kev )",
    ".    it might be reasonable to expect a strong reflected continuum to accompany the iron line in pg1402 + 261 .",
    "therefore we performed a spectral fit using an x - ray continuum model based on ionized reflection from the inner accretion disk , using the pexriv model within xspec @xcite .",
    "we assume a disk inclination angle of 60 degrees ( see section 3.2 for more detailed reflection fits ) , a disk temperature of @xmath35  k and use solar abundances , which are kept fixed in the spectral fit . a broad gaussian emission line is also included in the fit , as the pexriv model contains only the reflected continuum and not the iron emission line .",
    "the reflected continuum is smoothed with a gaussian function , identical in width to the broad iron line .",
    "the strength of the reflector @xmath36 is conventionally defined as the ratio of the solid angle subtended by the reflecting material to @xmath37  steradian , whilst the ionization parameter is defined as @xmath38 , where n is the density of the reflector and @xmath39 is the ionizing flux integrated over the 5  ev to 20  kev band .",
    "the fits results are shown in table 1 , fit 1 .",
    "the reflection model provides an acceptable fit with @xmath40 and a relatively high ionization parameter of log  @xmath41  erg  cm  s@xmath1 . in this model ,",
    "the continuum emission in pg1402 + 261  is parameterized with a single , steep power - law of @xmath42 , whilst the highly ionized matter is sufficiently reflective at lower energies to model the soft excess below 2 kev .",
    "note that the reflection fits are largely insensitive to the iron abundance , as the iron k shell edge present in the continuum reflection spectrum is highly smeared . even upon the addition of the reflector , the properties of the iron line are largely unchanged , with the equivalent width now being slightly lower at @xmath43  kev .    in figure",
    "2 , it appears that there may be two peaks within the _ xmm - newton _   line profile of pg1402 + 261 , one near 7.07.5kev and the other near 8.5kev . for instance",
    "one line may originate from fe  xxvi  k@xmath2 ( at 7.0  kev ) , the other peak from fe  xxvi  k@xmath8 or ni  xxviii  k@xmath2 ( near 8.0 kev ) .",
    "to parameterize this , we fitted the iron line profile of pg1402 + 261  with two gaussian lines , one with a rest energy of @xmath44  kev ( i.e. consistent with fe  xxvi k@xmath2 ) and another line at @xmath45  kev . for this fit",
    ", we revert to the simple broken power - law continuum ( without reflection ) , as described above .",
    "the equivalent width of the line at 7.1 kev line is much stronger than the higher energy line ( 1.3kev vs 0.4  kev ) .",
    "the fit is only slightly improved for the addition of three extra parameters compared to a single gaussian line fit ( @xmath46 vs 390.5/377 ) , therefore we consider the 2 gaussian line fit to be an over - parameterization of the data .",
    "nonetheless we do not rule out an additional contribution towards the line from either fe k@xmath8 or ni k@xmath2 .",
    "a further , much longer observation will be required with _ xmm - newton _  in order to investigate structure within the line profile .",
    "pg1402 + 261  was also previously observed by _ asca _  on january 12 , 2000 .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "data are composed of the sis0 ( exposure time @xmath47 43.2ks ) , sis1 ( @xmath47 37.7ks ) , gis2 and gis3 ( each @xmath47 57.3ks ) data .",
    "the background subtracted source spectra were subsequently analyzed , using a minimum of 20 counts per spectral bin .",
    "figure 3 shows the data / model ratio of the gis and sis data from @xmath48kev to a simple power - law model with galactic absorption , plotted in the quasar rest frame . there is a clear `` line - like '' excess in the data between 68.5  kev in the rest frame , similar to the residuals observed in the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum of pg1402 + 261 .",
    "subsequently , a fit above 1  kev using all four detectors , with a single power - law ( @xmath49 ) plus a broad emission gaussian line , gives a reasonable representation of the data ( @xmath50/d.o.f=404.2/361 , null hypothesis probability of @xmath51 ) and the line is required at a confidence level of @xmath5299.95@xmath14 .",
    "the energy of the line is 7.2@xmath53kev and its width is high with @xmath54=0.8@xmath55kev .",
    "the energy of the line is consistent with emission from he - like or h - like iron ( at 6.7 and 6.97  kev respectively ) .",
    "note that there are no other apparent residuals present in the spectrum below the iron k line energy .",
    "the ew of @xmath56  kev is lower than found during the xmm - newton observation , but is compatible within the errors . during the asca observation the 210kev unabsorbed flux was 2.5@xmath1010@xmath27erg@xmath6s@xmath1 ( sis0 ) , i.e. about 40@xmath14 higher than the xmm - newton observation .",
    "the addition of a reflection component to the model ( the pexriv model as described above ) does not strongly effect the line properties ( see table 1 , fit 2 ) . as the constraints on the reflected continuum from the _ asca _  data are worse than for _ xmm - newton _",
    ", the ionization parameter was fixed at log  @xmath57  erg  cm  s@xmath1 , whilst r was fixed at 2 ( i.e. the maximum permitted value , corresponding to @xmath58  steradian solid angle ) . the effect on",
    "the line is to slightly reduce its equivalent width , whilst the line width is then poorly constrained ( @xmath59  kev ) when the reflected continuum is included in the model .      given the large width of the emission line in the _ xmm - newton _  ( and _ asca _ ) fits , we attempted to fit the iron line profile with emission from the inner accretion disk around a kerr black hole , using the xspec laor model @xcite .",
    "an ionized reflection component was also included in the fits , in order to model the reflected continuum emission from the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "the reflected continuum is relativistically smeared using identical parameters as in the disk emission line model .",
    "we assume an inner radius of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , i.e. one gravitational radius ) and an outer radius of @xmath62 .",
    "initially we fix the disk inclination angle at @xmath63 , reasonable for a type i agn .",
    "we obtain a very high line energy of 8.5@xmath64kev , required to fit the blue - wing of the line between @xmath65  kev , whilst the line equivalent width is extremely large at @xmath66  kev , relative to the power - law continuum at 8.7  kev ( table 1 , fit 3 ) .",
    "the line energy is considerably larger than the rest energy of h - like iron ( 6.97kev ) , therefore this could indicate a significant outflow of the medium producing the line , i.e. 0.30.4c ( 90000120000kms@xmath1 ) , for h - like or neutral iron respectively . as an alternative model ,",
    "we free the disk inclination angle , but instead fix the rest energy of the iron line emission at 6.97 kev , i.e. corresponding to h - like iron .",
    "this then requires a large disk inclination of @xmath67 degrees in order to fit the blue - wing of the line , although the fit is equally acceptable ( table  1 , fit 4 ) , with an equivalent width of @xmath68  kev .",
    "thus either a substantial outflow of the line emitting matter is required , or the disk has to be highly inclined to the line of sight . given the evidence for a very strong broad line in pg1402 + 261 ,",
    "we tested whether the spectrum and line profile could be fitted with an ionized disk reflection model .",
    "we use the model xion from @xcite in the simplest lamppost configuration to model the emission above 2  kev , together with a soft featureless power - law component to model the steep soft x - ray excess in pg1402 + 261 .",
    "we fixed the height of the source above the disk to @xmath69 , the inner and outer disk radii to @xmath70 ( the minimum the model allows ) and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the accretion rate was fixed to 50% of eddington , whilst the ratio of x - ray to disc ( uv ) luminosity was set to 10% @xcite .",
    "we find the reflection model fits the spectrum well with @xmath72=3.11@xmath73 and @xmath74=1.70@xmath75 for the continuum photon indices and a fit statistic of @xmath76 .",
    "the unfolded spectral fit is shown in figure 4 .",
    "although the model produces mainly he and h - like fe emission ( at 6.7  kev and 6.97  kev respectively ) , a high disk inclination of greater than @xmath5260  is required to model the extreme blue - shift of the line .",
    "in addition , a high iron abundance of @xmath77 solar ( the maximum permitted value ) is required , whilst in order to model the extreme strength of the line , the hard emission component is required to be _ reflection dominated _ ,",
    "i.e. the illuminating hard power - law component can not be directly observed . as a consistency check",
    ", we compare the reflection results obtained with the xion model with the predictions of @xcite who compute reflection spectra from a constant density slab , illuminated by a power - law continuum . in their model , for",
    "pure reflected emission ( i.e. with no direct power - law observed ) , a line equivalent width of @xmath471.5kev in pg1402 + 261  requires an iron over - abundance of @xmath78 solar , assuming a reflection ionization parameter of log  @xmath79 and an illuminating power - law continuum of @xmath80 .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the reflection fits presented above .",
    "in the scenario where both the primary power - law and reflected emission are both observed ( corresponding to the reflector covering @xmath37  steradian solid angle ) , then the predicted line is not strong enough to account for the iron line feature in pg1402 + 261 . even for a @xmath81 solar abundance of iron ,",
    "the maximum predicted equivalent width is @xmath82ev .",
    "thus it is likely that the x - ray emission from pg1402 + 261  would have to be reflection dominated to explain the apparent strong iron line in the _ xmm - newton _  data .",
    "alternatively , we have investigated whether the strong iron k feature can be modeled with a highly ionized absorber .",
    "one can fit the spectrum reasonably well with a continuum modeled by two power - laws ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) , although the hard power - law has to be very flat to model the hard excess above 5  kev .",
    "the addition of an absorption edge at @xmath85  kev , with a depth of @xmath86 , models the sharp drop at 9 kev in the rest frame ( figure 2 ) , with a fit statistic of @xmath87 .",
    "the energy of the k - shell edge then either corresponds to h - like iron ( at 9.27 kev ) or he - like iron ( at 8.75 kev ) .",
    "we then proceed to fit the data with the xspec warm absorber model absori @xcite .",
    "the model is applied so that the soft x - ray power - law ( which may for instance originate directly from the disk ) is unattenuated , but so the hard x - ray power - law is modified by the absorber ( i.e. a partial coverer ) . in order to model the depth of the edge a large column density of @xmath88  @xmath6",
    "is required .",
    "formally , the 90% confidence lower - limit obtained on the ionization parameter from this model is log  @xmath89  erg  cm  s@xmath1 , with an outflow velocity of @xmath90  km  s@xmath1 , whilst the column density must exceed @xmath5  @xmath6 ( assuming @xmath77 solar abundance ) .",
    "the best fit model is shown in figure 5 , whilst the fit obtained is equally as good as the disk reflection model ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "inclusion of the warm absorber results in there now only being a requirement for a _ narrow _ iron k@xmath2 emission line , with an equivalent width of @xmath92  ev .",
    "the line centroid energy is @xmath93  kev , which indicates that there may still be some blue - shift of this component ; e.g. , @xmath94  km  s@xmath1 compared to the rest - frame energy of h - like fe at 6.97 kev .",
    "the partial covering model can also be applied to the _ asca _  spectrum of pg1402 + 261 .",
    "the fit obtained is equally good as the broad line fit reported in section 3.1 ( fit statistic @xmath95 ) .",
    "as above , the partial absorber covering is applied to the hard power - law , whilst a column density of @xmath96  @xmath6 and an ionization parameter of log  @xmath97  erg  cm  s@xmath1 are required , similar to the values obtained above .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of pg1402 + 261  shows a strong excess in the iron k - shell band between @xmath0  kev .",
    "if this is due to a relativistic disk line , then its parameters are rather extreme .",
    "the line equivalent width measured by _ xmm - newton _  is @xmath98  kev , even stronger than the broad iron line observed in mcg  -6 - 30 - 15 @xcite .",
    "such a strong iron k@xmath2 emission line can only be produced if the hard x - ray emission in pg1402 + 261  is dominated by the disk reflection component , with little of the direct hard power - law being observed .",
    "furthermore the rest - energy of the line , peaking above 7 kev and extending up to 9 kev , implies that the accretion disk is likely to be observed at large inclination angles , i.e. @xmath4 . such a high inclination is unusual for a type i agn in the context of agn unification schemes @xcite .",
    "interestingly a high ( 50 degrees ) inclination was recently inferred from the reflection fits to the nls1 galaxy , 1h0707 - 495 @xcite . taken together , the high inclination angle required in the reflection fits for both pg1402 + 261  and 1h0707 - 495 may argue against the pole - on model for some nls1s @xcite .",
    "it is possible that large density perturbations in the disk could explain the strong reflection dominated emission above 2  kev .",
    "variations of up to @xmath99 in density have predicted from simulations of highly turbulent disks @xcite , whilst reflection spectra have been calculated for inhomogeneous disks @xcite .",
    "thus a natural geometry could occur whereby the direct hard x - ray emission ( e.g. from compact coronal flares ) is obscured by dense , turbulent clouds within the disk surface layers , the same clouds then reflect the x - rays into the line of sight @xcite .",
    "a similar geometry was applied by @xcite to the narrow line seyfert 1 , 1h  0707 - 495 , which shows an unusually strong iron k edge at 7.1 kev . @xcite",
    "propose that the hard x - rays could be emitted within low density cavities between dense rings of matter on the disk surface ; the ring surfaces then reflect the x - rays into the observers line of sight , whilst the direct emission is obscured , producing a strong iron k line . in pg1402 + 261 , the direct x - rays are more likely to be obscured if the disk was viewed at large ( side - on ) inclination angles , as is inferred from our accretion disk fits .",
    "the soft x - ray ( and euv ) excess emission may not be obscured however , if this is the comptonized thermal emission from the extended inner disk region @xcite , although the enhanced ( reflected ) emission from the surface of the ionized disk may also contribute towards the soft x - ray excess .",
    "in the inhomogeneous reflection models of ballantyne , turner & blaes ( 2004 ) , the authors find that it may be difficult to produce a very strong iron line .",
    "however this is dependent on the geometry , if the reflected x - rays undergo multiple scattering ( i.e. the reflected x - rays are themselves reflected ) , then the resultant line equivalent width can be very high @xcite , as large as 6kev .",
    "one other possibility is that the disk reflection is enhanced by the effects of gravitational light bending of the hard x - ray emission _ towards _ the disk , i.e. returning radiation @xcite .",
    "this effect will be strongest when the x - rays are concentrated within @xmath100 around the spin axis of a maximally rotating black hole ( in the so - called  lamppost  configuration ) .",
    "indeed it has been suggested that the strong , redshifted iron line in mcg  -6 - 30 - 15 may be boosted by this process @xcite .",
    "however in order to explain the observed blueshift of the iron line profile , especially as a significant amount of the line flux would be gravitationally redshifted below 6kev in the above scenario , then the disk inclination angle in pg1402 + 261  must be nearly side - on .",
    "alternatively , the spectrum of pg1402 + 261  can also be modeled by a high column density , high ionization absorber , where the sharp drop at 9 kev in the spectrum can be fitted by a high ionization ( he or h - like ) k - shell edge of iron .",
    "both the column density and ionization of the absorber have to be rather extreme ( @xmath101  @xmath6 and log  @xmath89  erg  cm@xmath1  s@xmath1 respectively ) , to produce a @xmath7 iron k - shell edge at 9  kev .",
    "indeed @xcite have recently interpreted the strong fe k edge in the _ xmm - newton _  x - ray spectra of 1h0707 - 495 as due to a variable partial covering absorber and suggest that extreme disk reflection may not be required . additionally , other high column density iron k - shell absorbers , with similar absorber parameters to pg1402 + 261 , have recently been observed in _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _ observations of several high luminosity agn ; in particular pds  456 @xcite , pg  1211 + 143 @xcite , pg  1115 + 080 @xcite and apm  08279 + 5255 @xcite .",
    "the outflow velocities inferred in these absorbers were generally found to be extreme , of up to 0.1c .",
    "interestingly a _",
    "narrow _ blue - shifted iron k@xmath2 emission line at 7.5kev has been noted in the _ asca _  spectrum of the nls1 , rxj0136.9 - 3510 @xcite , these authors suggest that the line may also originate in an outflow with a velocity of @xmath103 .",
    "indeed one possibility is that the absorber arises from the innermost part of an high velocity accretion disk outflow , within a few ( @xmath104 ) radii of the black hole .",
    "as noted by @xcite , high velocity , large column density disk winds may be a natural consequence of accretion at a high fraction of the eddington rate ; in pg1402 + 261  the accretion rate is @xmath105 of eddington @xcite .    determining which model ( reflection vs absorber ) is the most plausible explanation for the iron k profile in pg1402 + 261  is not possible with the current short _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "however a high column density absorber may impart discrete spectral features that could be detected with a longer observation ( with _ xmm - newton _ ) or with much improved spectral resolution ( e.g. with the calorimeter - based xrs detector on astro - e2 , due for launch in 2005 ) .",
    "for instance , resonant k - shell absorption lines from fe  xvii through to fe  xxvi may be produced in high ionization gas , while a fe k@xmath8 unresolved transition array ( uta ) at 7.2 kev may arise from moderately ionized matter @xcite .",
    "strong absorption lines may also be detected from other elements ( e.g. mg , si and s ) , making it possible to constrain the kinematics of the outflow . indeed strong , blue - shifted ( by up to 0.1c ) absorption lines were detected in the xmm - newton observations of pg  1211 + 143 @xcite and resonant iron absorption lines may even affect the iron line profiles of some nearby seyfert 1 galaxies ; e.g. , ngc 3783 @xcite . alternatively if the spectrum of pg1402 + 261  can be explained by disk reflection , then it would be highly desirable to determine how the strong iron line changes with flux , in a much longer observation",

    "<S> alternatively the spectrum above 2 kev may instead be explained by an ionized absorber , if the column density is sufficiently high ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ) and if the matter is ionized enough to produce a deep ( @xmath7 ) iron k - shell absorption edge at 9 kev . </S>",
    "<S> this absorber could originate in a large column density , high velocity outflow , perhaps similar to those which appear to be observed in several other high accretion rate agn . </S>",
    "<S> further observations , especially at higher spectral resolution , are required to distinguish between the accretion disk reflection or outflow scenarios . </S>"
