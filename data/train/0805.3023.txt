    "to construct a statistical mechanics that applies to nonequilibrium states is one of the most challenging unsolved problems in theoretical physics .",
    "see @xcite and references therein . by a statistical mechanics ,",
    "we mean a universal theoretical framework that enables one to precisely characterize states of a given system , and to compute ( in principle ) arbitrary macroscopic quantities . the canonical distribution for equilibrium states , in which the probability of observing a microscopic state @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 $ ] , is a paradigm for a statistical mechanics .",
    "it is , however , quite unlikely that there exists a statistical mechanics that applies to _ any _ nonequilibrium systems .",
    "a much more modest ( but still extremely ambitious ) goal is to look for a theory that applies to nonequilibrium steady states , which have no macroscopically observable time dependence but have macroscopic flow of energy or material .",
    "there may be a chance that probability distributions for nonequilibrium steady states can be obtained from a general principle that is analogous to the equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to those models with extremely small `` order of nonequilibrium '' , the linear response theory provides us with a more or less satisfactory answer .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "one can represent steady state distribution and various physical quantities by using time - dependent correlation functions in the corresponding equilibrium state .",
    "but the restriction to the linear order is unsatisfactory at least from a purely theoretical point of view .",
    "it is highly desirable and challenging to obtain similar expressions which works beyond the linear response regime .",
    "in fact , formal expressions of the steady state distribution which are exact to full order were derived and discussed , for example , by mclennan @xcite , zubarev @xcite , and kawasaki and gunton @xcite .",
    "see for an example of such expressions .",
    "but such expressions , as they are , are too formal and do not directly provide us with meaningful information about the nature of nonequilibrium steady states . see section  [ s : comp ] .",
    "such expressions were indeed used as starting points of further explorations of nonequilibrium steady states .    in a recent progress ( which is of course closely related to previous works that we have mentioned ) in nonequilibrium physics , deep implications of the microscopic time - reversal symmetry",
    "were revealed @xcite .",
    "it was shown that seemingly simple symmetry has rich and meaningful consequences including the fluctuation theorem and the nonequilibrium work theorem .    in this connection ,",
    "two of us ( komatsu and nakagawa ) studied the heat conducting nonequilibrium steady state realized in a system attached to multiple heat baths , and obtained a novel concise representation of the steady state distribution @xcite .",
    "the representation is written in terms of the ( excess ) entropy production at the heat baths , and is correct to the second order in the heat current .",
    "although the result of @xcite is also based on the time - reversal symmetry , it stands out from the previous works in the following two points .",
    "first this result directly addresses the question about the precise form of the probability distribution in nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "secondly @xcite presents a non - exact result which is valid up to the second order in the heat current .",
    "we regard this restriction as a merit rather than a fault . by looking only at exact relations ,",
    "one is tempted to be satisfied with rather formal results which do not focus strongly on desired physics of nonequilibrium states .",
    "well controlled result for small `` degree of nonequilibrium '' ( like the one in @xcite ) may suggest various nontrivial natures of nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "we expect that this suggestive representation can be a starting point of further developments of nonequilibrium physics .",
    "in fact we have made use of this representation to derive thermodynamic relations for nonequilibrium steady states @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we do not go into applications of the representation of @xcite , but rather focus on its more basic aspects .",
    "we shall discuss some extensions , and also present an efficient derivation of the representation .    in @xcite ,",
    "the representation was derived for stochastic processes .",
    "since the essence of the representation is the microscopic time - reversal symmetry , this restriction is by no means essential .",
    "here we shall present a derivation of the representation for general models of nonequilibrium steady states which are described entirely in terms of deterministic classical mechanics .",
    "more precisely , we design the whole system ( including the heat or particle reservoirs ) using deterministic mechanics . by letting the whole system evolve for a sufficiently long time , we get a nonequilibrium steady state ( in a small part of the whole system ) .",
    "we can treat nonequilibrium steady states with a heat conduction or with a particle current ( maintained either by non - conservative external force or by particle reservoirs with different chemical potentials ) .",
    "we can also treat a nonequilibrium state which is maintained by an oscillating external force .    in @xcite ,",
    "only the lowest order of the representation was discussed in detail ( because of the limitation of the space ) .",
    "we here discuss the corresponding formal representation which is valid to the full order in the `` order of nonequilibrium . ''",
    "the derivation here is essentially the same as that in @xcite , but we have refined the argument so that to make it as transparent as possible .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : setting ] , we carefully describe our setting , and how one can realize a nonequilibrium steady state in a system described by deterministic ( hamiltonian or newtonian ) mechanics . in section  [ s :",
    "representaion ] , we introduce the notion of excess entropy production , and describe the main representation . in section  [ s :",
    "derivation ] , we derive the representation . finally , in section  [ s : paricleflow ] , we formulate nonequilibrium steady states with particle flow , and extend the representation .",
    "in the present section , we carefully describe the problem that we study . in short ,",
    "we construct deterministic classical mechanical systems of many particles which faithfully model typical situations where we expect to have nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "we consider a situation where a `` system '' is attached to @xmath3 large heat baths with different temperatures .",
    "we shall model the whole system as a classical mechanical system which consists of @xmath4 distinct parts .",
    "the first part is the system parts is referred to as the `` whole system '' . ] while the latter are the heat baths .",
    "we assume that the different parts do not exchange particles , but the system and each heat bath may exchange energy .    by @xmath5",
    "we collectively denote the coordinates and momenta of the system , which contains @xmath6 particles , and by @xmath7 the coordinates and momenta of the @xmath8-th heat bath , which contains @xmath9 particles . by @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",

    "@xmath12 denotes the coordinates and momenta of the whole system .",

    "the potential @xmath33 represents the interaction between the particles in the @xmath8-th bath and in the system .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the time evolution map of the whole system from time @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",

    "( more generally @xmath40 denotes the projection of @xmath41 onto @xmath10 . )",
    "we do not make the @xmath42-dependence explicit since @xmath42 is mostly fixed .",
    "the time evolution map @xmath43 may be that generated by the static hamiltonian , but may be much more general ( see section  [ s : examples ] for examples ) .",
    "all that we require are that @xmath43 preserves the lebesgue measure of the total phase space @xmath17 ( which is the statement of the liouville theorem ) , and that it satisfies the time reversal symmetry @xmath44 for any @xmath41 , where @xmath45 is the inverse time evolution , i.e. , the inverse function of @xmath43 .",
    "see fig.[f : path ] .",
    "one has the symmetry in a general newtonian dynamics without a magnetic field .    for an arbitrary function @xmath46 on @xmath17",
    ", we define its time reversal @xmath47 by @xmath48 for any @xmath41",
    ". intuitively speaking , @xmath47 is basically the same thing as @xmath46 , but represented as a function of the `` final state '' at @xmath36 .",
    "since we are considering a deterministic mechanical system , the initial state @xmath37 determines the whole trajectory from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "some function @xmath49 on @xmath17 should better be interpreted as a function of the whole trajectory @xmath50 rather than the initial state @xmath37 .",
    "( a notable example of such a function is the entropy production defined in . ) in such a case , the time reversal @xmath51 is interpreted as a function of the time reversed trajectory @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the inverse temperatures of the heat baths , which we shall fix .",

    "the `` free energy '' for the coupling between the system and the baths defined as @xmath64 appears in our representation .",
    "let us stress that @xmath65 is a combination of equilibrium quantities with different temperatures , and is in principle computable . in the weak coupling limit , which is standard in the literature ,",
    "one neglects the effect of the coupling @xmath66 ( except for that needed to get steady states ) . in this limit one can simply set @xmath67 .",
    "let us assume that the state at @xmath35 is drawn from the distribution , and consider the state of the system at @xmath36 . by definition the probability density of finding the system at state @xmath68 is @xmath69",
    "we assume that the heat baths are so large that their states wo nt change essentially for quite a long time ( see the remark below ) .",
    "this means that each heat bath essentially remains in the equilibrium with the inverse temperature specified in the initial state .",
    "then there exists a range of time which is short enough for the heat baths but long enough for the system .",
    "within such a time scale , the system is expected to settle to a unique nonequilibrium steady state which is independent of the initial state @xmath57 , and is characterized by the inverse temperatures @xmath58 of the heat baths as well as other nonequilibrium conditions ( see the examples below ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath42 is chosen from this range .",
    "we can then reasonably assume that @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the probability distribution in the unique nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "* remark * : it is possible to define an artificial heat bath which maintains equilibrium for an arbitrarily long time .",
    "the bath consists of classical particles confined in a three dimensional box defined by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the particles do not interact with each other and are reflected elastically by the walls .",
    "the face with @xmath74 is attached to the system , and the particles in the system and those in the bath interact through short range repulsive interaction .    in the initial state , the particles in the bath are uniformly distributed in the box ( except near @xmath74 ) , and their velocities are exactly distributed according to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "as the whole system evolves , the maxwell - boltzmann distribution may be lost by the interaction between the system and the bath . but",
    "those `` nonequilibrium particles '' simply fly away to the positive @xmath75 direction , and wo nt come back until it is reflected back by the wall at @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the bath looks exactly as in equilibrium from the system for a finite amount of time . by making @xmath77 large with",
    "the density fixed , we can realize a bath which is effectively in equilibrium for an arbitrarily long time .",
    "we note that this bath , which lacks relaxation process , does not provide a model of realistic large baths .",
    "but it shows that our assumption is satisfied in at least one example .      for an arbitrary function @xmath46 on @xmath17 , and any @xmath78",
    ", we define the conditioned average @xmath79 note that this may be interpreted as the average over all the histories in which the system is initially at @xmath57 and finally at @xmath1 . to consider the average in which both the initial and the final conditions are specified was an essential idea in @xcite , on which the present work is also based .",
    "in addition to the conditioned average , we define two kinds of partially conditioned averages .",
    "one is @xmath80 which is a natural average when the initial distribution @xmath59 is specified . by taking into account the assumption that the unique steady state is attained at @xmath36 , we have written the final state as `` @xmath81 '' ( which stands for steady state ) .",
    "the other average treats the opposite situation , where the system starts from the steady state and ends precisely at the specified state @xmath82 .",
    "it is defined by averaging @xmath83 over the initial state as @xmath84      let us describe typical examples to which our general theory apply .    in what follows , we mean by `` equilibrium case '' the situation where @xmath85 for all @xmath8 with some @xmath86 , and the time evolution @xmath43 is the pure hamiltonian time evolution determined by the static hamiltonian .",
    "we shall consider models in which certain nonequilibrium features are added to this `` equilibrium case . ''",
    "see fig .",
    "[ f:123 ] .",
    "there can be many examples that fit into our general scheme , but let us discuss three typical cases . in all the examples ( and in general ) , we denote by @xmath87 a dimensionless quantity that measure the `` degree of nonequilibrium '' .",
    "the equilibrium case corresponds to @xmath88 .",
    "heat conduction : _",
    "we let the number @xmath3 of the heat baths to be more than one , and assume that @xmath89 are different .",
    "the time evolution @xmath43 is the pure hamiltonian time evolution determined by the static hamiltonian .",
    "then there should be a nonvanishing heat current in the steady state .",
    "we take @xmath90 to be proportional to the heat current .",
    "driven system ( dc field ) : _    we let @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "suppose that the particles in the system are confined in a box with periodic boundary conditions in one direction , say the @xmath93-direction .",
    "we assume that particles feel external driving forces ( proportional to @xmath90 ) in the @xmath93-direction .",
    "one may imagine that there is an `` electric field '' in the @xmath93-direction and exerts the electrostatic force on charged particles .",
    "since such an external drive can not be modeled by a hamiltonian dynamics ( when we use periodic boundary conditions ) , we consider a newtonian dynamics in which the force on a particle is the sum of the external driving force and the force determined by the static hamiltonian .",
    "it is crucial that the liouville theorem and the time reversal symmetry still hold for this dynamics .",
    "driven system ( ac field ) : _    we again let @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "we consider the situation where particles are acted by a force which varies periodically in time .",
    "a typical example is a system under an oscillating electric field . after a sufficiently long time",
    ", the system is expected to settle into a periodically varying state with the same period as the external force . by looking at the state when external force has a fixed phase , one effectively observes a `` steady '' state .",
    "we wish to focus on such a sate ( and call it a steady state with a slight abuse of the terminology ) .",
    "the time evolution @xmath43 is determined by a time dependent hamiltonian @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a periodically changing potential .",
    "the dynamics satisfies the liouville theorem . in order to guarantee the time reversal symmetry",
    ", we further assume that the potential satisfies @xmath96",
    ".    clearly one can consider models in which these three nonequilibrium factors ( and other possible factors ) are combined .",
    "but we believe that to have these three typical examples in mind will be helpful in understanding the general representation that we shall derive .    in section  [ s : paricleflow ] , we treat a situation in which the system and the baths ( reservoirs ) exchange particles",
    ". then one can realize    _ 4 .",
    "particle flow maintained by a difference in chemical potentials : _    by considering a system attached to multiple reservoirs with different chemical potentials ( and possibly with different temperatures ) and allowing the system and the reservoirs to exchange particles , one can realize a nonequilibrium steady state with a constant flow of particles ( and possibly with a heat conduction ) .",
    "see section  [ s : paricleflow ] for details .",
    "in the present section , we describe the representations and of the steady state distribution . for this purpose",
    "we define relevant quantities carefully in section  [ s : ep ] .",
    "we also compare the present representation with the existing similar results in section  [ s : comp ] .      for @xmath41 ,",
    "let us define @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the total hamiltonian for the @xmath8-th bath defined in .",
    "note that @xmath99 can be interpreted as the total heat that has flown from the system to the @xmath8-th heat bath as a part of the energy of the bath .",
    "in fact we do not have a convincing physical argument for justifying this particular choice .",
    "we use this definition only because we can derive the main representation by using it .",
    "of course this delicate issue becomes irrelevant in the weak coupling limit .",
    "] during the time interval from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath100 defined in is the total entropy production due to the transfer of heat into the @xmath3 heat baths . although @xmath100 is defined here as a function of the initial state @xmath41 , it may be more naturally regarded as a function of the whole trajectory from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "in fact by denoting @xmath101 the heat current that flows into the @xmath8-th bath at time @xmath102 in the trajectory @xmath50 , one has @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the entropy production rate .    in a nonequilibrium steady state , there should be a constant flow of heat into ( or from ) heat baths resulting in positive constant entropy production rate .",
    "therefore the average like @xmath105 should grow linearly with time @xmath42 .",
    "let us define the entropy production rate @xmath106 as @xmath107 where the average may be any of the three kinds , , that we have defined since the long time behavior should not depend on the initial and the final conditions . here",
    "@xmath108 means `` make @xmath42 large in the range which is not too large for the heat baths . ''    then by subtracting the steady contribution from the total entropy production , we define the excess entropy production as @xmath109 we recall that the similar excess quantities plays a fundamental role in the phenomenological approach to nonequilibrium steady states @xcite .",
    "now we shall state our major result .",
    "let us write the steady state distribution as @xmath110 , \\label{e : rhosspss}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the `` effective hamiltonian '' which plays a role of the quantity @xmath112 in equilibrium .",
    "the most important result of the present paper is the concise representation ( obtained in @xcite ) of the steady state distribution @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a normalization constant independent of @xmath1 ( but of course dependent on @xmath58 and other nonequilibrium parameters ) .",
    "the `` free energy '' of the coupling @xmath115 defined in is an equilibrium quantity which becomes negligible in the weak coupling limit .",
    "thus the only nonequilibrium quantities contained in the right - hand side of are the expectation values of the excess entropy production @xmath116 . since @xmath116 may be regarded as a quantity of first order in @xmath90 , one may naturally expect that the representation is correct up to the first order in @xmath90 .",
    "rather surprisingly , we shall show that ( as indicated in the error term in ) this representation is correct to the second order in the degree of nonequilibrium @xmath90 .",
    "we indeed have an expression to the full order in @xmath90 as in .",
    "but the above second order expression seems most useful and suggestive .",
    "let us examine the two conditioned expectation values that appear in .",
    "recalling the expression of the excess entropy production , the first expectation value is written as @xmath117 since the average of @xmath118 in the steady state is @xmath106 , the integrand is vanishing except for small values of @xmath102 where the system is forced to be out of the steady state by the imposed initial condition .",
    "thus the integrand in is non - negligible only for @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is a constant which is sufficiently larger than the relaxation time of the system .",
    "likewise the other average @xmath121 is essentially determined from an integral from @xmath122 to @xmath42 .",
    "we thus find that the representation converges rapidly when @xmath42 is increased beyond the relaxation time .",
    "the representation has a very interesting form which contains the difference between the two conditioned averages of the excess entropy production .",
    "since it turns out that @xmath123 , the two terms roughly have comparable contributions . but to get the result which is precise to @xmath124 , it is necessary to consider the difference of the two averages .      by fixing a reference equilibrium inverse temperature @xmath125 , and using the energy conservation",
    ", we can rewrite the representation in a different form , in which the contributions from the canonical distribution becomes clearer .",
    "let us define @xmath126 which we may call the `` nonequilibrium part '' of the entropy production . here",
    "@xmath125 is the reference inverse temperature , which may be chosen rather arbitrarily .    by recalling the definitions of the static hamiltonian and the entropy production , we see that @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the total work that was done ( say , by the external force ) to the whole system from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "note that in the example 1 of heat conduction , we have @xmath130 because of the energy conservation . on the other hand ,",
    "in the example 2 and 3 , we have @xmath131 and the second term of is vanishing .",
    "since @xmath100 and @xmath132 differs only by a quantity which depends on the initial and final states of the system , the averages @xmath133 , @xmath134 grow linearly as @xmath135 with the same @xmath106 as in .",
    "we therefore define the corresponding excess quantity as @xmath136 .",
    "then the representation is rewritten in the form @xmath137 where the new constant is defined by @xmath138 .",
    "we shall here compare our representation and with two of the well - known representations of the steady distribution .",
    "first is the linear response theory .",
    "indeed it is automatic to get a representation correct up to @xmath139 if we have a representation which is correct to @xmath124 . by starting from the representation , and only taking the lowest order contributions , one arrives at @xmath140 here @xmath141 denotes the conditioned averages as in and , defined in the corresponding `` equilibrium case '' with @xmath88 .",
    "we also replace the steady state in the initial or final conditions by the equilibrium state ( as is indicated by the subscript `` eq '' ) .",
    "the averaged quantity @xmath142 in , on the other had , is a genuine nonequilibrium quantity . by using the time reversal symmetry , which implies @xmath143 ,",
    "the expression can be simplified as @xmath144    the expression is the standard result of the linear response theory , and may be used to derive well - known useful expressions of , say , transport coefficients .",
    "we wish to stress that our representation is as concise as the linear response relation but properly takes into account nonlinear effects .",
    "next we shall focus on exact expressions for the steady state distribution . by using the same notations as before , one can ( rather formally ) show that the steady state distribution is written as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is an arbitrary fixed reference state .",
    "see the end of section  [ s : repder ] .",
    "this is one of the well - known exact expressions for steady state distribution which were discussed by many authors including zubarev , mclennan , and kawasaki and gunton @xcite .",
    "although somehow resembles our , there are indeed marked differences .",
    "first of all , is an expression for the distribution itself and hardly provides information about the `` effective hamiltonian '' @xmath147 .",
    "moreover it is crucial that the bare entropy production @xmath148 ( rather than the excess entropy production @xmath116 ) appears in .",
    "since the quantity @xmath148 typically grows as @xmath135 in the steady state , the @xmath108 limit of is extremely delicate .",
    "it is expected that the quantity @xmath149 exhibits wild fluctuation , and a miraculous cancellation leads to a result which is independent of @xmath42 .    on the other hand ,",
    "our expression has a nicely controlled large @xmath42 behavior .",
    "what we have in are essentially short time integrals of the excess entropy production .",
    "this is indeed true for our higher order expressions .",
    "to conclude , although the exact but formal expression and our representation apparently look similar , their natures are drastically different .",
    "let us discuss the derivation of the results in detail .    in section  [ s : bi ]",
    ", we derive the basic identity , which represents the time - reversal symmetry in the present system .",
    "the derivation is a straightforward application of the standard idea repeatedly used , for example , in @xcite .    in sections  [ s : repder ] and [ s :",
    "oe ] , we derive the representation . the basic idea is essentially the same as that in @xcite , but we have refined the derivation to make it as efficient and transparent as possible .",
    "we note that although our derivation is quite sensible in physicists standard , it is not ( yet ) a mathematical proof .",
    "we believe that some new ideas are required to construct a true proof .",
    "we first show the identity @xmath150 which is valid for an arbitrary function @xmath46 on @xmath17 .",
    "here and in what follows , we drop the @xmath58 dependence of @xmath151 .",
    "we note that this identity is a formal consequence of mechanics ( and the choice of initial distribution ) , and is independent of the assumption about the approach to steady state .",
    "let us also note that by dividing by the same equation with @xmath152 , we get an interesting identity @xmath153 which reveals a beautiful time - reversal symmetry in a system far from equilibrium .",
