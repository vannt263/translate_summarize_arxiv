    "accurate measurements of particles masses , couplings and widths are possible by measuring production cross sections near threshold .",
    "the naturally small beam energy spread of a muon collider would provide an excellent opportunity to make these measurements .",
    "pair production of @xmath1-bosons , @xmath2 production and the bjorken process @xmath3 have been considered as possible places to study thresholds at a muon collider@xcite .",
    "there is very rich physics associated with the @xmath4 threshold , including the determination of @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 , and possibly @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a precise value of the top - quark mass @xmath5 could prove to be very valuable in theoretical studies .",
    "fadin and khoze first demonstrated that the top - quark threshold cross section is calculable since the large top - quark mass puts one in the perturbative regime of qcd , and the large top - quark width effectively screens nonperturbative effects in the final state @xcite .",
    "such studies have since been performed by several groups @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological potential is given at small distance @xmath11 by two - loop perturbative qcd and for large @xmath11 by a fit to quarkonia spectra . in our analysis",
    "we make use of the wisconsin potential  @xcite that interpolates these regimes .",
    "the beam energy spread at a @xmath12 collider is expected to naturally be small .",
    "the rms deviation @xmath13 in @xmath14 is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the rms deviation of the gaussian beam profile .",
    "with @xmath17 the resolution @xmath18 is of the same order as the measurement one hopes to make in the top mass . for @xmath19 studies",
    "the exact shape of the beam is not important if @xmath17 .",
    "we take @xmath20 here ; the results are not improved significantly with better resolution@xcite , and a high energy @xmath21 collider in the large vlhc tunnel would have a beam spread of @xmath22  gev@xcite ] .",
    "changing the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath23 influences the threshold region .",
    "large values lead to tighter binding and the peak shifts to lower values of @xmath14 .",
    "weaker coupling also smooths out the threshold peak .",
    "these effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .",
    "= 3.0 in    to assess the precision of parameter determinations from cross section measurements , we generate hypothetical sample data , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , assuming that 10  fb@xmath24 integrated luminosity is used to measure the cross section at each energy in 1  gev intervals .",
    "since the top threshold curve depends on other quantities like @xmath25 , one must do a full scan to determine the shape of the curve and its overall normalization .",
    "to generate the ten data points in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] we use nominal values of @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we assume a 29% detection efficiency for @xmath28 , including the decay branching fraction .",
    "the data points can then be fit to theoretical predictions for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath25 ; the likelihood fit that is obtained is shown as the @xmath29 contour plot in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "the inner and outer curves are the @xmath30 ( 68.3% ) and @xmath31 ( 95.4% ) confidence levels respectively for the full 100  fb@xmath24 integrated luminosity . projecting the @xmath30 ellipse on the @xmath5 axis , the top - quark mass can be determined to within @xmath32 , provided systematics are under control .",
    "( systematic error issues will be discussed later . ) a top - quark mass of 175 gev can be measured to about 200 mev at @xmath33 confidence level with 10  fb@xmath24 luminosity .",
    "= 3.0 in    since the exchange of a light higgs boson can affect the threshold shape , a scan of the threshold cross section can in principle yield some information about the higgs mass and its yukawa coupling to the top quark .",
    "figure  [ figure8 ] shows the dependence of the threshold curve on the higgs mass , @xmath9 .",
    "however , it may be difficult to disentangle such a higgs effect from two - loop qcd effects , which are not yet fully calculated  @xcite .",
    "= 3.0 in    = 3.0 in    qcd measurements at future colliders and lattice calculations will presumably determine @xmath25 to 1% accuracy ( e.g.  @xmath34 ) @xcite by the time muon colliders are constructed so the uncertainty in @xmath8 will likely be similar to the precision obtainable at a @xmath12 and/or @xmath21 collider with 100  fb@xmath24 integrated luminosity .",
    "if the luminosity available for the threshold measurement is significantly less than 100  fb@xmath24 , one can regard the value of @xmath25 coming from other sources as an input , and thereby improve the top - quark mass determination .",
    "there is some theoretical ambiguity in the mass definition of the top quark .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty on the quark pole mass due to qcd confinement effects is of order @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a few hundred mev @xcite . in the @xmath36 scheme of quark mass definition ,",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is better controlled .",
    "systematic errors in experimental efficiencies are not a significant problem for the @xmath37 threshold determination of @xmath38 .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , which shows that a 200 mev shift in @xmath38 corresponds to nearly a 10% shift in the cross section on the steeply rising part of the threshold scan , whereas it results in almost no change in @xmath18 once @xmath39 is above the peak by a few gev . not only will efficiencies be known to much better than 10% , but also systematic uncertainties will cancel to a high level of accuracy in the ratio of the cross section measured above the peak to measurements on the steeply - rising part of the threshold curve .    as fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] shows , it will be important to know the higgs mass and the @xmath40 coupling strength in order to eliminate this source of systematic uncertainty when extracting other quantities .",
    "the measurements described in this section can be performed at either an @xmath21 or a @xmath12 collider .",
    "the errors for @xmath38 that we have found for the muon collider are smaller than those previously obtained in studies at the nlc electron collider primarily because the smearing of the threshold region by the energy spread of the beam is much less , and secondarily due to the fact that the reduced amount of initial state radiation makes the cross section somewhat larger .",
    "with an integrated luminosity of 10 ( 100 )  @xmath41 , the top - quark mass can be measured to 200 ( 70 )  mev , using a 10-point scan over the threshold region , in 1  gev intervals , to measure the shape predicted by the qcd potential . in the @xmath42 threshold study ,",
    "differences of cross sections at energies below , at , and above the resonance peak , along with the location of the resonance peak , have different dependencies on the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath43 and should allow their determination . to utilize the highest precision measurements achievable at the statistical level , theoretical uncertainties and other systematics need to be under control .",
    "we are confident that uncertainty in @xmath8 will not be a factor and we have noted that ratios of above - peak measurements to measurements on the steeply rising part of the threshold cross section will eliminate many experimental systematics related to uncertainties in efficiencies .",
