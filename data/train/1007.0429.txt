    "fluids that are brought into contact with a disordered porous matrix drastically change their physical properties . over the past two or three decades numerous experimental and theoretical investigations",
    "have been dedicated to studying this phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable efforts that have been undertaken to obtain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms are not only motivated by academic interest .",
    "fluids confined in disordered porous environments play a key role in a wide spectrum of applied problems ranging from technological applications over chemical engineering to biophysical systems .",
    "thus , a deeper understanding of _ why _ fluids change their properties under such external conditions is of great practical relevance .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "a quantitative description of such systems is a formidable challenge for several reasons .",
    "for one , it is difficult to reliably and realistically represent the matrices found in experiments or technological applications ( such as aerogels or vycor ) .",
    "having chosen some model for the confinement , an even more demanding task is to formulate a theoretical framework that is able to appropriately describe the interplay of connectivity and confinement of the pores pertinent to the matrix . even after reducing such system to the so - called quenched - annealed ( qa ) model , where for simplicity the matrix is assumed to be an instantaneously - frozen configuration of an equilibrated fluid ,",
    "an appropriate theory is highly intricate .",
    "madden and glandt  @xcite , and later given and stell  @xcite , derived a formalism based on statistical mechanics that considers the system to be a peculiar mixture with the matrix being one of the components . within their framework ,",
    "given and stell derived ornstein - zernike - type integral equations ( the so - called replica ornstein - zernike equations , roz ) that  in combination with a suitable closure relation  allow to determine the static correlators and the thermodynamic properties of a qa system  @xcite . their formalism is based on a twofold thermodynamic averaging procedure : one over all possible fluid configurations for a fixed matrix realization , the other one over all possible matrix configurations .",
    "this double - averaging procedure is adapted to the letter in computer simulation studies of fluids confined in disordered porous materials ; in terms of computing time this is a demanding enterprise .    until few years ago most theoretical and simulation studies focused on the _ static _ properties of qa systems such as structure and phase behavior .",
    "in contrast , comparatively little effort had been devoted to the _ dynamic _ properties .",
    "the main obstacles inhibiting such investigations were , on one side , the lack of a suitable theoretical framework that would have allowed to reliably evaluate the dynamic correlation functions of the fluid particles , and , on the other hand , limitations in computational power for simulations when explicitly performing the above - mentioned double - averaging procedure . to the best of our knowledge , the first simulation studies dedicated to the dynamic properties of fluids in disordered porous confinement were performed by gallo and rovere  @xcite , followed shortly after by kim  @xcite . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning similar investigations on the lorentz gas model  @xcite and on binary mixtures in which particles are characterized by a large disparity in size  @xcite or mass  @xcite , i.e. , systems that can be viewed to be closely related to qa systems .    over the past years",
    ", major breakthroughs have been achieved in describing theoretically the dynamic properties of fluids in confined in porous media .",
    "in particular , use was made of mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite and of the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory  @xcite , both of which rely on inferring the dynamics of a system from its static structure .",
    "mct has played over the last decades a central role in describing the dynamic properties of fluids  @xcite , including in particular the glass transition .",
    "krakoviack succeeded in deriving mct - type equations for the dynamic correlation functions , which require as an input the static correlation functions of the annealed fluid , which in turn are obtained from the roz equations .",
    "subsequently , krakoviack solved these equations for the specific case of a hard - sphere fluid confined in a disordered matrix of hard - sphere particles of equal size and evaluated single - particle and collective correlation functions of the system . based on this knowledge ,",
    "a kinetic diagram was traced out in the parameter space spanned by the packing fraction of the fluid and that of the matrix , indicating the regions in which the system is in an arrested or in a nonarrested state .",
    "the resulting kinetic diagram is very rich and quite surprising : the regions of arrested and nonarrested states are separated by a line along which at small matrix packing fractions type - b transitions and at intermediate matrix packing fractions type - a transitions occur . as a peculiar feature of this line ,",
    "a re - entrant glass transition is predicted for intermediate matrix and small fluid packing fractions .",
    "additionally , in the region of nonarrested states a continuous diffusion - localization transition is observed .",
    "however , we emphasize that the combined roz+mct framework predicts _ ideal _ transitions , whereas in experiment or simulation transitions will always be smeared out .    throughout this contribution",
    "we employ the type - a / type - b terminology that is conventionally used to characterize the behavior of a dynamic correlator as an ideal transition occurs .",
    "this terminology refers to the decay pattern of the correlator as well as to the behavior of its long - time limit upon crossing a dynamic transition . in a `` type - a '' transition",
    "a correlator relaxes in a single step , and its long - time limit may assume arbitrarily small nonzero values . in a transition of `` type - b , '' on the other hand , a correlator decays in a distinct two - step pattern ; upon crossing the transition the second decay step is delayed to infinity and the long - time limit of the correlator jumps from zero to a nonzero value .",
    "the type - b behavior is well - known from bulk glass formers  @xcite and is usually attributed to a `` cage effect '' imposed upon fluid particles by their neighbors .",
    "this remarkably rich phase behavior has motivated simulation studies which  as a consequence of the considerable increase in available computation power  have meanwhile come within reach .",
    "short accounts have been given in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "in this contribution we elaborate on our investigations on the dynamic behavior of a fluid confined in a disordered porous matrix within the qa picture . for simplicity , and for congruence with the theoretical studies @xcite , we consider a fluid of hard spheres confined in a disordered matrix formed by hard spheres of the same size .",
    "investigations are based on event - driven molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "within the two - dimensional parameter space we focus mainly on three representative pathways to put the theoretical predictions to a thorough test : ( i ) a path at constant low matrix packing fraction , probing the existence of the continuous type - b transition , ( ii ) a path at constant intermediate matrix packing fraction , probing the discontinuous type - a transition and the re - entrant scenario , and ( iii ) a path at intermediate , constant fluid packing fraction , probing the diffusion - localization transition .",
    "results are summarized in kinetic diagrams , where we consider  complementing our previous communication  different criteria to define dynamical arrest .",
    "we compare our simulation results with the predictions of mct , which , however , is not straightforward due to the ideal nature of the latter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in we present the model and our simulation method , transferring the rather lengthy description of the system setup to .",
    "results are compiled in : we start with the static structure of the system and then discuss various methods of how to define slowing down and the ensuing kinetic diagrams . in the subsequent three subsections we discuss the intermediate scattering functions and the mean - squared displacement along the three aforementioned paths through parameter space . the final subsection of shall deal with the van hove correlation function in order to discuss trapping . in we",
    "extend the analysis of the intermediate scattering functions to discuss the arrest scenarios in more detail .",
    "the paper closes with concluding remarks alongside with an outlook on future work required to settle questions yet open .",
    "the aforementioned is succeeded by in which we elaborate on the issue of the effects of system size on the dynamical correlation functions .",
    "[ width = ] figure01.eps    for the purpose of this work we opted for the `` quenched - annealed '' ( qa ) protocol since it is well - defined , well - tractable by theory , and involves only a small number of parameters . in this protocol both the porous confinement and the confined fluid are represented by a set of particles , conventionally called `` matrix '' and `` fluid '' particles or  borrowing from the typology of metallurgy  as `` quenched '' and `` annealed '' component . in this , qa systems bear resemblance to mixtures ; however , the matrix particles are pinned at particular positions and act as obstacles for the fluid particles . in this work ,",
    "we exclusively consider systems containing one matrix and one fluid species ; quantities pertaining to those species will be designated with the subscripts `` m '' and `` f , '' respectively .    adopting the concept of immobile obstacle particles , there are still numerous schemes for their arrangement  @xcite .",
    "the qa protocol specifies the positions of the matrix particles to be frozen from an equilibrium one - component fluid ; the fluid particles merely move within this matrix and do not exert influence upon it  .",
    "notably , the fluid particles may also dwell in `` traps''finite spatial domains entirely bounded by infinite potential walls formed by the confining matrix .",
    "since for this work we are interested in a minimal approach to the dynamics of a fluid moving in disordered confinement , we decided to exclusively employ hard - sphere ( hs ) interactions among the particles .",
    "this deprives the system of any inherent energy scale , rendering the only relevant system attributes to be of geometrical nature .",
    "we further reduced the parameter space by requiring all particles involved to be of the same ( monodisperse ) diameter  @xmath2 .",
    "this introduces @xmath2 as the unit of length used throughout this study , and leaves the system to be governed by mere packing fractions , namely the matrix packing fraction @xmath0 and the fluid packing fraction @xmath1 . as mentioned before ,",
    "this particular choice of system was examined in  @xcite . a snapshot of a typical hs - qa system at large matrix density is shown in .",
    "in this work we study qa systems utilizing molecular simulations . since we are primarily interested in dynamical features , we applied molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to track the physical time evolution of a system .",
    "all md computations were performed using the event - driven algorithm described in @xcite ; modifications to that algorithm were essentially limited to fixing particles in space in order to adapt to the qa protocol .",
    "( notably , this adjustment invalidates the conservation of momentum and angular momentum . ) as is conventional , we employed periodic ( toroidal ) boundary conditions and the minimum - image convention in order to mimic an infinite system .",
    "in addition to the usual thermodynamic averaging , @xmath3 , the qa protocol imposes another averaging procedure over _ disorder _ , @xmath4 , so as to restore homogeneity and isotropy . depending on the state point @xmath5 and the number of particles in the system",
    ", we averaged our data over at least ten matrix configurations ; for selected state points , we increased that number to as much as @xmath6 .",
    "a nontrivial task is to find an initial system configuration given some state point . in this work",
    ", we are interested in systems in which the @xmath7 fluid particles comprise most of the space that is left accessible to them by the @xmath8 immobile matrix particles  i.e . ,",
    "_ high - density _ systems .",
    "generating instances of the porous confinement is effortless , since for all state points of interest , @xmath0 is situated well within the fluid regime when used for a one - component system of mobile particles .",
    "the problem rests in determining permissible initial positions for the @xmath7 fluid particles . creating an amorphous high - density configuration of bulk monodisperse hard - sphere particles already represents an interesting task , with various elaborate algorithms having been developed to accomplish this task  @xcite",
    "however , none of these algorithms are suited for adaption to the setup of hs - qa systems .",
    "this unfortunate finding prompted us to devise a custom routine which is described in detail in .",
    "after successful setup of a system instance , the simulation time was set to @xmath9 and an attempt to equilibrate the system using the md routine was made . the decision whether or not the particular system realization was considered equilibrated was based on the mean - squared displacement    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the location of a tagged ( superscript `` @xmath12 '' ) fluid particle at time @xmath13 .",
    "note that the above definition is the one used in and hence involves an average over matrix configurations ; of course this average has to be omitted when using @xmath14 to characterize a single system realization .",
    "also , note that the notion of a `` tagged particle '' does _ not _ imply the presence of an additional tracer particle .",
    "we defined a system realization to be in equilibrium if @xmath15 was fulfilled .",
    "we allowed at least @xmath16 time units for the system to equilibrate ; for certain state points we extended @xmath17 to as much as the tenfold value . the conventional unit of time @xmath18 used throughout this work is based upon the mass @xmath19 of the fluid particles , their diameter @xmath2 ( see above ) , and their temperature @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "data were only compiled after equilibration was attempted , using the final configuration of the equilibration run as initial configuration of the data run .",
    "generally , the final time for data collection , @xmath21 , was chosen to be equal to the final time of the equilibration attempt , @xmath22 ; in particular in some nonequilibrated systems we also used @xmath23 to investigate particular features of the system . for most state points",

    "[ width = ] figure02.eps    [ width = ] figure03.eps    the most obvious properties to inspect in our systems are simple static structural properties ; this investigation was already carried out in great detail in  @xcite . in the present context static properties",
    "are of use for a different reason : since the particles were chosen to be of monodisperse diameter  @xmath2 , crystallization might take place in the case of dilute matrices .",
    "inspection of the radial distribution function @xmath31 and the static structure factor @xmath32 provides a means to determine whether or not this is the case .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to investigate fluid - fluid correlations , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , since only for @xmath35 systems are prone to crystallization . therefore , the index `` @xmath36 '' will henceforth be dropped .",
    "we first consider the static structure factor    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 denotes the location of fluid particle @xmath40 .",
    "displays this function for moderate ( @xmath41 ) and for low ( @xmath42 ) matrix packing fractions , i.e. , for systems particularly prone to crystallization . clearly , all features of @xmath32 evolve smoothly upon increasing @xmath1 , suggesting that no phase transition takes place .",
    "moreover , the absence of sharp peaks for all state points indicates that no simple crystalline long - range order is present .",
    "related arguments hold for the radial distribution function    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the system volume .",
    "shows this function for the same matrix packing fractions as above ( @xmath45 ) . as for @xmath32 , the features of @xmath31 develop continuously , which again supports the notion that a phase transition is absent .",
    "additional peaks in @xmath31 at specific positions would be a hallmark of crystallization . for fcc- or bcc - like short - range order",
    ", the most pronounced additional peaks would be located at @xmath46 or @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the volume fraction of close - packed monodisperse hard spheres .",
    "for instance , for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , crystallites would cause a peak at @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , peaks at these positions are absent in . on the other hand , in both panel ( a ) and",
    "( b ) an additional peak at @xmath54 emerges upon increasing @xmath1 .",
    "however , this peak is a well - known feature of glass - forming systems  @xcite and thus provides further evidence for the absence of crystallization .",
    "we conclude that crystallites , albeit possibly temporarily present , do not play a major role in the systems under investigation .",
    "[ width = ] figure04.eps    [ width = ] figure05.eps    many features of the system under investigation can be understood by means of kinetic diagrams in which the `` state '' of a dynamic property is indicated in the plane spanned by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in an earlier work  @xcite we presented a kinetic diagram based on the mean - squared displacement  @xmath14 . in order to classify the state of the system ,",
    "we chose a mean - squared displacement @xmath55 and a simulation time  @xmath16 ; if the system obeyed @xmath56 then it was considered `` nonarrested , '' and otherwise `` arrested . ''",
    "the so - constructed kinetic diagram qualitatively confirmed the behavior of the single - particle dynamics of the system at hand as predicted by mct  @xcite . the arrest line determined from this criterion",
    "is indicated in .",
    "in we present a kinetic diagram of the system under investigation based on the self - intermediate scattering function    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the density of a tagged ( superscript `` @xmath12 '' ) fluid particle in @xmath59 space after some time  @xmath13 has passed  .",
    "the symbols in the figure indicate the times @xmath60 needed for @xmath61 to decay below the value @xmath62 .",
    "the value @xmath63 was chosen to be close to the main peak in @xmath32 in a typical high - density qa system  for instance , for @xmath50 and @xmath64 ( cf .  )",
    "the first peak in @xmath32 is located at @xmath65 ; for @xmath66 and @xmath67 it is found at @xmath68 .    if we let @xmath69 , discriminating whether for a state point @xmath70 ( `` arrested '' ) or @xmath71 ( `` nonarrested '' ) yields the thick solid ( blue ) line in .",
    "obviously , the latter is only slightly different from the thick dotted ( green ) line that is obtained from the @xmath14 criterion described above .",
    "this is not unexpected since both @xmath72 and @xmath14 are single - particle properties , and in the gaussian limit it is even @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "thus , the validity of the approach chosen in  @xcite is confirmed .    in order to complement the kinetic diagrams based upon single - particle properties , in we present for the first time a kinetic diagram for a collective property of the system . for comparison with the theory developed in  @xcite we chose to operate with the connected part of the intermediate scattering function    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the fluctuating part of @xmath76 ( cf .  ) . very much like for the self - intermediate scattering function @xmath72 , in this figure we display the times @xmath77 needed for @xmath78 to decay below the value @xmath79 .",
    "the thick dash - dotted ( red ) line in interpolates through points for which @xmath80 . the shape of this iso-@xmath77 line clearly contradicts the mct scenario  @xcite , which predicts a re - entrance regime ( a `` bending - back '' of the collective glass transition line ) for large values of @xmath0 .    since the arrest line obtained from @xmath60",
    "is situated at considerably larger @xmath0 than the diffusion - localization line predicted by mct , it is reasonable to expect a similar shift for the glass transition line .",
    "unfortunately , an estimate for such shift suggests that the re - entrant scenario may take place at combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at which systems can not be set up due to geometric constraints ( cf .  ) .",
    "however , one should also bear in mind that the available mct calculations are based on structure factors obtained from integral equations  @xcite as it is still difficult to extract reliable blocked correlations from simulations  @xcite .",
    "thus , it remains hard to disentangle the inherent deficiencies of mct from those related to the input structural data , especially at high matrix densities .",
    "based on simple arguments , in  @xcite it is concluded that the glass transition line has to coincide with the diffusion - localization line in the limit of vanishing fluid density .",
    "the data presented in and [ fig : kinetic_diagram / fkt_coll.con ] are ostensibly inconsistent with this expectation .",
    "we remark , however , that our simulations do not provide for this special case since we decided to retain a nonvanishing number of fluid particles in every system realization so as to always have finite fluid - fluid correlations .",
    "more importantly , in we will provide evidence that using the present definition of the decay times @xmath77 and @xmath60 , the two quantities are not quite comparable to one another .

    "for both observables , the wave vector was chosen to be @xmath85 , which is close to the first peak in the static structure factor ( cf .  ) .",
    "for elevated @xmath1 an intermediate - time plateau can be identified in both @xmath72 and @xmath81 ; as @xmath1 is increased , this plateau extends to longer and longer times but does not change in height .",
    "moreover , @xmath72 and @xmath81 decay on the same time scale as they approach this type - b transition .",
    "this is a well - known phenomenon in bulk glass formers  @xcite , where the collective glass transition drives the arrest of the individual particles .",
    "the bulklike behavior is also prevalent in @xmath14 , as is evident from .",
    "for the lowest value of @xmath1 depicted , @xmath14 crosses over directly from ballistic ( @xmath86 ) to diffusive ( @xmath87 ) behavior . upon increasing @xmath1 the ballistic range",
    "is followed by a distinct regime in which @xmath14 grows only very slowly , which is reflected by a drop of @xmath88 below unity and as low as @xmath89 for the highest @xmath1 considered .",

    "moreover , @xmath81 and @xmath72 deviate substantially from one another .",
    "most strikingly , the time scales on which the correlators decay to their long - time value are vastly disparate , and increasingly so for larger values of @xmath1 . at @xmath93 , for instance , the decay times read @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this represents a difference of almost three decades in time , with the _ collective _ correlator decaying faster .",
    "@xmath91 seems to approach a transition since the time it needs to decay to its long - time value increases substantially as @xmath1 is increased .",

    "for one , in simulations a type - a transition may show features that differ from the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "further , it is possible that an intermediate - time plateau would emerge upon increasing @xmath1 above @xmath96 ( the largest value of @xmath1 depicted in ) .",
    "note , however , that beyond @xmath97 geometry strongly inhibits to realize system instances ( see ) .",
    "we conclude that using the current scheme of simulation and analysis , no definite statement can be made about the type  of transition in @xmath81 in this part of the kinetic diagram .",
    "@xmath92 shows an intermediate - time plateau for large values of @xmath1 , just as in .",

    "a tail can be identified even at the lowest fluid packing fraction considered ( @xmath101 ) , whereas in this case _ no _ intermediate - time plateau is present .",
    "therefore , for the sequence of state points at hand , two superposing decay behaviors exist in @xmath72 : a type - a transition responsible for the long - time value , and another relaxation mechanism at higher @xmath1 that leads to the intermediate - time plateau and is likely to be caused by a weak collective cage effect . the type - a transition is probably connected to the continuous diffusion - localization transition predicted by mct  @xcite and is discussed in more detail in and [ subsec : trapping ] .",

    "contrary to the bulklike case , this observation holds also for very low @xmath1 , suggesting that caging by fluid particles is not the only mechanism effective in this regime .",
    "most likely , at low @xmath1 the drop in @xmath84 is entirely due to the porous matrix , while at larger @xmath1 both the pores and caging play a role .    for low @xmath1",

    "the estimated value @xmath103 in the subdiffusive regime is only weakly dependent on @xmath1 ; merely for @xmath104 the value of @xmath84 seems to systematically decrease .",
    "this decline , however , may be due to insufficient equilibration of the respective systems .      [ width = ] figure10.eps    [ width = ]",

    "the actual pattern of the decay to the long - time value is quite similar in @xmath81 and @xmath72 : unlike in , both correlators decay in a single step , suggesting only type - a transitions to be involved .    comparison of with and [ fig : const_mpf0.05/msd ] reveals the functional form of @xmath14 to be more sensitive to @xmath0 than to @xmath1 . as observed in , at low matrix densities the initial ballistic behavior",
    "is directly followed by diffusive behavior . for intermediate @xmath105 ( cf .  ) a region of very slowly increasing particle displacement ( @xmath102 ) succeeds the ballistic range .",

    "subsequently , diffusive behavior is recovered as @xmath84 raises in an almost linear fashion .    upon further increasing @xmath0 , at some @xmath106",
    "a geometric percolation transition takes place in the space accessible to the fluid particles ( `` voids '' ) , with a void stretching through the whole system at @xmath107 .",
    "this transition is intimately connected with the diffusion - localization transition predicted by mct  @xcite and observed in our simulations . as a hallmark of this transition , @xmath14 does not approach diffusive behavior for @xmath108 but instead remains at an approximately constant @xmath109 for a window covering about three decades in time .",
    "since for that matrix density @xmath88 ultimately increases beyond @xmath110 , one can expect the diffusion - localization transition to take place at slightly higher @xmath0 .",
    "an upper bound to that value is @xmath111 , the smallest value presented that is larger than @xmath112 . at this packing fraction of obstacles the window of constant @xmath84",
    "extends over roughly two decades in time , with @xmath84 ultimately decreasing below that plateau .",
    "judging from these observations , the subdiffusion exponent  @xmath84 at the diffusion - localization transition might be slightly lower than 0.5 .",
    "nevertheless , the observed value of @xmath84 is in striking agreement with mct , which predicts that @xmath113  @xcite .",

    "so - called `` single - file diffusion''the mean - squared displacement of the particles grows with precisely the same exponent as in our case .",
    "however , it remains an open question whether in qa systems the main effect in single - file diffusion  nonovertaking particles  is prevalent , or if other ( possibly compensating ) reasons lead to a coincidental agreement in @xmath84 .",

    "likewise , for any nonzero density of traps there will be trapped particles since the initial locations of the fluid particles are randomly distributed .",
    "two types of nontrivial questions remain to be assessed .",
    "first of all , there exists the aforementioned distinct @xmath106 above which all fluid particles are trapped .",
    "differently phrased ( cf .  ) , upon varying @xmath0 , a percolation transition of the space accessible to the fluid particles takes place : for @xmath107 , there exists an infinitely - large void , whereas for @xmath114 any void is of finite size .",
    "naturally , the question arises what the precise value of @xmath106 is . in the following",
    "we will investigate the behavior of fluid particles that explore the voids by studying the distribution of their displacements , as was done before for other types of confinement  @xcite .",
    "our quantity of choice for the desired analysis is the self - part of the direction - averaged van hove correlation function    @xmath115    where @xmath116 and by construction @xmath117 . strictly speaking , to assess the void structure only knowledge about the infinite - time limit @xmath118 is required .",
    "however , since data are readily available , in the following we will also discuss some features of the time evolution of @xmath119 in order to corroborate and extend our findings from the previous sections .    using the self - part of the van hove function a number of quantities of interest",
    "can be assessed at least qualitatively .",
    "for instance , the matrix density at percolation , @xmath106 , can be estimated by exploiting the fact that as the system control parameter ( here @xmath0 ) is varied the average size of the `` aggregates '' ( in this case the traps ) diverges at the transition .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath120 , the distribution of trap sizes is reflected in @xmath118 since in the infinite - time limit the nontrapped fluid particles have diffused far away . concentrating on a particular distance @xmath121 , the function",
    "@xmath122 will exhibit two maxima as @xmath0 is varied , one for @xmath123 and one for @xmath124 .",
    "the corresponding integral @xmath125 represents an estimate for the fraction of fluid particles located in traps .",
    "of course , in simulations @xmath126 has to be approximated by some finite time @xmath127 greater than the structural relaxation time of the system .    in and [ fig : trapping / lower - right ] the van hove function",
    "is displayed at various @xmath13 as a function of @xmath120 . for visual guidance ,",
    "curves are highlighted for selected times .",
    "the times of successive light ( gray ) lines differ by @xmath128{10}$ ] , i.e. , there are about six curves per time decade . in",
    "( a ) @xmath119 is shown for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , a bulklike state point like those discussed in . at short times",
    "@xmath119 exhibits a single , approximately gaussian peak .",
    "as @xmath13 increases , the maximum value of this peak decreases , but notably its @xmath120 position remains nearly constant even for large @xmath13 .",
    "this is another manifestation of the cage effect prevalent in glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "further support for this picture arises from the second peak in @xmath119 that emerges at @xmath129 for @xmath130 , which indicates the presence of hopping processes . for very long times",
    "even a moderate third peak appears at @xmath131 as @xmath119 recovers a gaussian - like shape centered at @xmath132 .",
    "the validity of these arguments becomes clear when considering ( b ) which depicts @xmath119 for @xmath90 and @xmath93 .",
    "for this state point , representing intermediate matrix density , similar features can be observed for short and intermediate times , only with the first peak decreasing slower in height , the second peak being less pronounced , and the third peak missing .",
    "however , for large @xmath13 and small @xmath120 the shape of @xmath119 is markedly different from that in ( a ) : even for @xmath133 ( the largest time considered ) we find @xmath134 to be nonzero for small @xmath120 .",
    "since curves of @xmath119 very much resemble each other for @xmath135 and @xmath136 , it is reasonable to assume that in this range @xmath134 represents a reliable approximation to @xmath118 .",
    "hence we can infer the presence of trapped particles , with their fraction being @xmath137 using @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath134 is close to zero for @xmath139 , there likely exist only few traps with a spatial extent exceeding @xmath140 .",
    "the trend seen from ( a ) to [ fig : trapping / upper - left](b ) is continued by the systems represented in .",
    "panel ( c ) of that figure shows the state point at @xmath66 and @xmath67 , that is , close to the diffusion - localization transition ( discussed in ) ; the state point in panel ( d ) is situated well in the localized phase at @xmath141 and @xmath101 .",
    "the change in shape over time becomes less pronounced as @xmath0 increases , turning the second peak into a mere shoulder .",
    "the largest times depicted in again represent a sound approximation of @xmath118 .",
    "for the state point in panel ( d ) we numerically obtain @xmath142 using @xmath143 and @xmath144 , which is in excellent agreement with the figure @xmath145 that would be expected in an infinitely - large system residing beyond the percolation transition . for the state point in ( c ) , using the same @xmath140 and @xmath127 we obtain @xmath146 , which , however , is rather imprecise since @xmath147 is considerably greater than zero .    in ( c ) and ( d ) the correlator @xmath119 differs markedly from that in ( a ) and ( b ) . for one , in both ( c ) and ( d )",
    "a second peak is present even for @xmath148 , suggesting that on average traps are large enough to allow for hopping .",
    "another feature is less obvious but more important to the percolation transition : for large distances @xmath118 is _ greater _ in ( c ) than in ( d ) for the same @xmath120 .",
    "this implies that the mean trap size is larger in ( c ) than in ( d ) , which is not unexpected  in fact this confirms the transition to take place between ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "thus , using @xmath119 we find @xmath149 as an estimate for the matrix packing fraction at the percolation transition , which is in accordance with our findings in the previous sections .",

    "this choice is motivated by the key role played by these dynamic correlation functions within the mct framework for confined fluids , which provides detailed predictions for @xmath72 and @xmath81 . before discussing in more detail",
    "the comparison between the theoretical scenario of mct and our simulations , it is instructive to study correlation functions _ related _ to @xmath72 and @xmath81 .",
    "namely , we will investigate here the total intermediate scattering function    @xmath151    as well as a modification of the self - intermediate scattering function in which the long - time plateau ( as observable , for instance , along paths ii and iii ) is subtracted out .",
    "this will allow to clarify aspects related to the kinetic diagram of the system and to facilitate the interpretation of the numerical results in the light of the mct predictions .    by construction ,",
    "fluids confined in porous media possess nonzero average density fluctuations , @xmath152 , induced by the matrix structure .",
    "this purely - static background becomes visible in the long - time limit of the total intermediate scattering function @xmath153 .",
    "collective relaxation phenomena in confined fluids are therefore more conveniently described by the connected correlator , , in which only the _ fluctuations _ of the microscopic density are considered .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to also inspect the shape of @xmath153 as a function of the state parameters . in",
    "we show @xmath153 for some selected densities along path i ( @xmath50 ) for the same value of @xmath59 considered in . except for the lowest fluid density , @xmath101",
    ", the @xmath153 correlator attains a finite , sizeable plateau at long times . to check whether this long - time plateau is due to the purely - static background mentioned above or actually",
    "reflects a nonergodic behavior of the system , we also include in this figure the function @xmath154/s(k)$ ] , where    @xmath155    is the so - called blocked structure factor , and @xmath156 is the connected structure factor .",
    "it is easy to show that , if the system is ergodic , the blocked structure factor is the infinite - time limit of the un - normalized total intermediate scattering function  @xcite and that    @xmath157    holds as an equality .    from",
    "we see that this equality is indeed fulfilled for @xmath158 , while slight deviations occur at the largest fluid packing fractions .",
    "note , however , that the calculation of @xmath159 is also affected by statistical noise ( see error bars in ) and systematic effects  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless provides an effective criterion to discriminate nonequilibrated samples as far as the collective relaxation is concerned .",
    "we also note that if we employ the criterion @xmath160 to define the relaxation time @xmath161 , the latter strongly overestimates the slowness of the collective relaxations compared to @xmath77 due to the emergence of the finite plateau in @xmath153 upon increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this should be born in mind when discussing decoupling phenomena between single - particle and collective properties .",
    "a similar , yet physically different long - time plateau is observed in the self - intermediate scattering functions along path ii and iii ( see and [ fig : const_fpf0.10/fkt ] ) . as discussed in ,",
    "the finite value of @xmath162 reflects the trapping of particles in disconnected voids of the matrix structure .",
    "since the existence of a rising plateau affects the evaluation of the relaxation times @xmath60 , it is sensible to define a modified correlator @xmath163 , where the long - time limit @xmath164 is identified by some construction   for fixed @xmath59 is as follows : first , the global minimum @xmath165 of the self - intermediate scattering function is identified .",
    "then , the standard deviation , @xmath166 , of @xmath72 is computed over different time ranges @xmath167 , keeping the upper bound @xmath168 of the range fixed at the maximum time available while progressively increasing the lower bound @xmath169 .",
    "if @xmath170 is below some preset tolerance threshold then @xmath72 is considered to be constant in the corresponding time range . if this condition is met while @xmath171 then @xmath172 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath72 has not reached its long - time plateau within the time range considered . ] .",
    "the results of this procedure are collected in for selected state points at @xmath67 ( path iii ) and compared to the corresponding @xmath72 .",
    "at the two largest @xmath0 the relaxation to the finite plateau is not complete within the time range considered , and the correlators are left unshifted .",
    "evaluation of the single - particle relaxation time @xmath173 , defined by @xmath174 as for the other correlators , allows to filter out the contribution to the single - particle dynamics due to trapping .",
    "we constructed two alternative kinetic diagrams for the system at hand using the relaxation times @xmath161 and @xmath173 obtained from @xmath153 and @xmath175 .",
    "as in , lines drawn in and [ fig : kinetic_diagram / fkt_self.no_ltv ] correspond to a fixed , constant value of the relaxation times ( isorelaxation times lines ) .",
    "let us first focus on , displaying the kinetic diagram based on @xmath161 . in this case",
    ", the range of state points available to determine the isorelaxation times lines is more limited due to the incipient growth of the plateau in the region of large @xmath1 and large @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that the shape of the estimated arrest line is non - re - entrant , confirming the analysis based on the connected correlators ( see ) .",
    "a more interesting effect is observed in where we show the kinetic diagram based on @xmath173 . for better comparison with the analysis in",
    "we also include the isorelaxation times lines obtained from the self and the connected correlators .",
    "interestingly , the shape of the kinetic diagram for @xmath173 strongly resembles that obtained from the connected correlator .",
    "in particular , the iso-@xmath173 lines do not bend rapidly toward @xmath27 as @xmath0 is increased but rather stretch to larger @xmath0 values , following the trend of the iso-@xmath77 line .",
    "this effect can be understood as follows : after subtracting the long - time plateau , which is due to trapping , the residual relaxation of @xmath72 is governed by a weak , collective caging effect .",
    "the relaxation of @xmath72 _ toward the long - time limit _ occurs , in fact , on a _",
    "similar _ time scale as the relaxation of @xmath81 .",
    "this supports our interpretation of the complex relaxation pattern of @xmath72 for large matrix packing fractions ( see ) as a superposition of trapping and caging effects , and confirms the connection between the diffusion - localization transition and the appearance of a nontrivial decoupling between single - particle and collective properties  @xcite .",
    "in this contribution we have investigated the dynamic properties of a fluid confined in a disordered porous matrix . in our investigations",
    "we have reduced such system to a simple qa model where the matrix is a quenched configuration of a liquid and the fluid particles equilibrate within that matrix .",
    "both matrix and fluid particles are chosen to be hard spheres of equal size .",
    "thus , the parameter space characterizing the system reduces to a two - dimensional plane spanned by the packing fraction of the matrix particles and that of the fluid particles .",
    "investigations have been carried out via event - driven molecular dynamics simulations , observables were evaluated using the double - averaging recipe characteristic for qa systems .",
    "specifically , we have evaluated the connected and the single - particle intermediate scattering functions , the mean - squared displacement , and the self - part of the van hove function .",
    "the data and conclusions summarized here represent a counterpart to the recently presented results obtained from a theoretical framework  @xcite . the latter approach  an extension of mct to the qa protocol  had predicted a number of intriguing features in the kinetic diagram .",
    "our investigations have complemented this scenario of _ ideal _ transitions , unveiling the properties of the _ real _ transitions : ( i ) at low matrix packing fractions we have undoubtedly confirmed the predicted type - b glass transition scenario .",
    "( ii ) for intermediate matrix packing fractions we have found at least two arrest mechanisms of different nature , with the self - intermediate scattering function displaying a more complex behavior than its connected counterpart .",
    "this scenario can be rationalized as a superpositioning of the effect of trapping in disconnected voids and of a weak caging mechanism collective in nature .",
    "( iii ) varying at low fluid packing fractions the density of the matrix we found evidence for a diffusion - localization transition , reflected in the self - intermediate scattering function as well as in the mean - squared displacement and in the self - part of the van hove function .",
    "( iv ) despite considerable effort we were unable to support the predicted re - entrant transition scenario .    in order to obtain deeper insights into the open questions we have additionally considered along path ii the total intermediate scattering function , and along path iii we have subtracted from the self - intermediate scattering functions the long - time plateau as there is evidence that the latter is due to trapping .",
    "our analysis of these data supports the previously established notion of an interplay between the two phenomena dominating the arrest transition at intermediate matrix packing fractions , namely trapping and caging .",
    "work to disentangle the effects of the latter on the dynamic correlation functions is currently underway .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with v. krakoviack and k. miyazaki .",
    "this work was funded by the austrian science foundation ( fwf ) under project no .",
    "[ width = ] figure18.eps    as mentioned in the initial setup of a hs - qa system represents a formidable challenge . in this appendix",
    "we will point out algorithms known to succeed in setting up disordered one - component hs systems at high density , comment on problems in extending those algorithms to the qa protocol , and report on our custom solution to the problem .",
    "the challenge is the following : given the positions of the @xmath8 immobile obstacle particles , permissible positions are sought for the @xmath7 particles that during md will be allowed to move . unfortunately , to this respect multiple complications arise in hs - qa systems , the three most important of which are : ( 1 ) particle overlaps are strictly forbidden , ( 2 ) in the resulting configuration the matrix particles have to occupy precisely - specified locations , and ( 3 ) all voids  notably also the disconnected ones  have to be considered as locations for the fluid particles .",
    "the simplest method  trial - and - error insertion of the fluid particles  is useless already for setting up _",
    "high - density systems of hard spheres . for the latter task a useful straight - forward method",
    "( although prone to crystallization ) is compressing a low - density system , for instance by coordinate re - scaling combined with random particle displacements , or by applying a unidirectional force in a bounded system .",
    "however , there also exist elaborate algorithms to maximize the density in disordered hs systems ; they employ for instance serial deposition  @xcite or overlap elimination  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the complications mentioned before render these methods difficult to adapt and/or ineffective .",
    "therefore , in order to efficiently achieve high densities in hs - qa systems we devised a custom algorithm , which consists of the following three steps :    \\(1 ) upon insertion of a fluid particle its `` real '' diameter ( the diameter to be used during md simulations ) is reduced to some minute value ( `` deflated '' ) so that the probability of an insertion via trial - and - error is greatly increased . this way , throughout the search of an allowed configuration all particles can be present in the system simultaneously .",
    "\\(2 ) in order to find such allowed configuration a simple metropolis monte - carlo algorithm  @xcite is employed using the hs potential . since using",
    "this algorithm with the minute diameters is meaningless , at the beginning of each sweep ( one displacement attempt for each fluid particle ) the diameter of each deflated particle is increased ( `` inflated '' ) to the maximum value possible without overlapping another particle . if for a particle the latter value is greater than its real diameter then inflating is done for this particular particle and it is assigned its real diameter ( `` fully inflated '' ) .",
    "\\(3 ) a disconnected void may be filled with ( almost ) any number of deflated particles ; however , the particular void may be too small to accommodate all of these particles if they were fully inflated . to remedy this problem , before certain sweeps",
    "all particles that are not yet fully inflated are removed from the simulation box and then re - deflated and re - inserted according to step  1 .",
    "the number of sweeps separating two such removal - and - reinsertion procedures is gradually increased so as to allow for any number of sweeps to fully inflate a particle while still quickly `` draining '' crammed voids .",
    "obviously , as soon as all particles are fully inflated the setup routine is completed and a configuration fulfilling the qa requirements has been found . in step 2",
    "the fluid particles are inflated serially .",
    "this leads to the distribution of diameters covering a wide range at all times during iteration , except when close to the approach of an allowed configuration .",
    "since this introduces a `` fluctuating polydispersity , '' we found the generation of ordered states at high densities to be strongly suppressed even for bulk monodisperse systems .",
    "figure [ fig : kinetic_diagram / inflation ] gives an overview over the state points at which , according to the above - described steps , a system instance with @xmath24 particles may be set up with probability @xmath176 within @xmath177 cpu minutes ( intel core 2 duo e8400 ) .",
    "comparing the so - found line of discrimination ( red solid line in ) with the @xmath14 dynamic arrest criterion ( green dotted line in ; see and  @xcite ) and other features of the kinetic diagrams , one can see that even using our custom routine the system setup represents a challenge to access the state points of interest .",
    "note that in practice a probability of 50% is unsatisfactory .",
    "ideally , none of the setup attempts should be rejected since as little bias as possible should be exerted on the statistics",
    ". however , already at relatively low @xmath0 achieving @xmath178 is strictly impossible , the reason being that there exist peculiar matrix configurations that prohibit all fluid particles to be inserted .",
    "nonetheless , by prolonging the cpu time @xmath179 it is possible to increase @xmath180 since more theoretically possible system configurations can actually be realized . throughout this paper",
    "only state points have been considered for which @xmath181 was achieved .",
    "[ width = ] figure19.eps      as mentioned in , throughout this work we chose to assign the same constant total number of particles @xmath182 to most systems simulated .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to determine for which state points this number is _ not _ sufficient to rule out the presence of finite - size effects , and to describe our pertinent solution .    strictly adhering to the approach of constant @xmath28 , state points with a large disparity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 attain low values of either @xmath8 or @xmath7 .",
    "neither is desirable since it will render the calculation of properties pertaining to either the matrix or the fluid inaccurate . in this work ,",
    "the most extreme case for low @xmath8 is the state point ( @xmath183 , @xmath184 ) , with @xmath26 entailing @xmath185 .",
    "the corresponding extremal case for @xmath7 is the state point ( @xmath186 , @xmath187 ) , leaving only _ eight _ fluid particles to move in a matrix of @xmath188 particles .",
    "hence , in the present work the much more severe problem lies in low values of @xmath7 .    to remedy this problem we chose to adjust @xmath28 such that neither @xmath8 nor @xmath7 assume a value below a lower limit of @xmath189 .",

    "we assess whether or not the choice of @xmath191 is reasonable .    in order to limit the effort , we consider a single state point representative of the problem of low @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , we inspect various observables at @xmath192 and @xmath193 , i.e. , at a state point close to both @xmath27 and the percolation transition in the voids ( cf .   and [ subsec : trapping ] ) .",

    "it is not surprising that the @xmath198 curves in this case exhibit larger deviations from one another than the @xmath197 curves considering that the latter approach zero rather quickly whereas @xmath198 does not completely relax .",
