    "stellar bars play an important role in the dynamical evolution of gas in galaxies . by introducing a non - axisymmetric torque",
    ", they produce interesting morphological substructures in the gaseous medium , including a pair of dust lanes at the leading side of the bar , a nuclear ring near the center , and nuclear spirals inside the ring ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they also transport gas inward which can trigger starbursts in the rings ( e.g. , @xcite ) and if the mass inflow extends all the way to the center , they may help power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since bar substructures represent a nonlinear response of the gas to a non - axisymmetric gravitational potential , their formation and evolution is best studied using direct numerical simulations .",
    "there have been a number of numerical studies on the gas dynamics in barred galaxies . based on the numerical scheme employed",
    ", they can be categorized largely into two groups : ( 1 ) those using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ( 2 ) those using a grid - based algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical results from these two approaches do not always agree with each other , at least quantitatively , even if the model parameters are almost identical .",
    "for instance , @xcite using the cmhog code on a cylindrical grid reported that the gas near the corotation regions exhibits complex density features resulting from rayleigh - taylor and/or kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , while these structures are absent in the sph simulations .",
    "in addition , overall shapes and structures of dust lanes and nuclear rings from cmhog simulations are different from sph results .    some differences in the numerical results may be attributable to relatively large numerical diffusion of a standard sph method and its inability to handle sharp discontinuities accurately ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , after adopting and thoroughly testing the cmhog code as part of this work , we have found it contained a serious bug in the way the gravitational forces due to the bar are added to the hydrodynamical equations .",
    "thus , some of the discrepancies in the flows computed by cmhog and other codes are likely due to this bug .",
    "we discuss this bug and its affect on the results reported in @xcite in section 2.2 .    in this paper , we revisit the gas dynamics in barred galaxies using a corrected version of the cmhog code .",
    "our objectives are three - fold .",
    "first , we wish to remedy the errors in @xcite , and to compute the formation of bar substructures with an accurate shock - capturing grid code with the correct bar potential .",
    "second , the morphology , shape , and strength of the bar substructures are likely to depend on the gas sound speed and the shape of the underlying gravitational potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we report new models in which we include a central black hole ( bh ) that greatly affects the gravitational potential in the central regions , and we vary both the bh mass as well as the sound speed to explore the dynamics in various galactic conditions .",
    "third , we exploit advances in computational resources to compute models that have more than an order of magnitude higher resolution than the models in @xcite , with a grid resolution of @xmath4 pc in the central regions .",
    "this allows us to resolve details in the flow in the nuclear regions , in particular the formation of nuclear rings and nuclear spirals .",
    "according to the most widely accepted theory , a nuclear ring forms near the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) when there is only one ilr , as the gas outside ( inside ) ilr loses ( gains ) angular momentum and accumulates there , while it forms in between the inner ilr and outer ilr when there are two ilrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , @xcite argued that the ring formation is more deeply related to the existence of @xmath2-orbits rather than the ilrs .",
    "but , the arguments relying on either ilr or @xmath2-orbits do not take into account the effect of thermal pressure .",
    "therefore , it is important to explore to what extent the concepts of ilr or @xmath2-orbits are valid in describing nuclear rings , especially when the sound speed is large .    the formation , shape , and nature of nuclear spirals that may channel the gas to the galaxy centers are also not well understood .",
    "observations using the _ hubble space telescope _ indicate that galaxies having nuclear dust spirals are quite common ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while most of such spirals are trailing , a few galaxies including ngc 1241 and ngc 6902 reportedly possess leading nuclear spirals @xcite .",
    "although the linear theory suggests that leading spirals are expected when there are two ilrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they are absent in the numerical models of @xcite computed with the cmhog code , while the sph models of @xcite with self - gravity do form leading spirals .",
    "the sph models suffer from poor spatial resolution at the nuclear regions as most particles gather around the rings . by running high - resolution simulations with a corrected version of cmhog",
    ", we can clarify the issues of the nuclear spiral formation and related mass inflow rates to the galaxy center .",
    "we in this work treat gaseous disks as being two - dimensional , isothermal , non - self - gravitating , and unmagnetized , which introduces a few caveats that need be noted from the outset . by considering an infinitesimally - thin disk , we ignore gas motions and associated dynamics along the direction perpendicular to the disk . by imposing a point symmetry relative to the galaxy center",
    ", our models do not allow for the existence of odd-@xmath5 modes , although this appears reasonable since @xmath6 modes dominate in the problems involving a galactic bar .",
    "in addition , we are unable to capture the potential consequences of gaseous self - gravity and magnetic stress that may not only cause fragmentation of high - density nuclear rings but also affect mass inflow rates to the galaxy center . nevertheless , these idealized models are useful to isolate the effects of the gas sound speed and the mass of a central bh on the formation of bar substructures and mass inflows .",
    "also , these models allow us to correct the results of previous cmhog calculations with incorrect bar forces .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe the galaxy model , model parameters , and our numerical methods . in section 3 , we present the results of simulations for off - axis shocks and nuclear rings .",
    "the detailed properties of nuclear spirals are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we study the mass inflow rates through the inner boundary obtained from our simulations . in section 6 ,",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results and their astronomical implications .",

    "we consider a uniform , isothermal , infinitesimally - thin , and non - self - gravitating gas disk orbiting in a gravitational potential @xmath9 arising from various components of a barred galaxy . the bar is assumed to rotate about the galaxy center with a fixed pattern speed @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , it is advantageous to solve the dynamical equations in cylindrical polar coordinates ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) corotating with the bar in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "the equations of ideal hydrodynamics in this rotating frame are @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath0 denote the surface density , velocity in the rotating frame , and the sound speed in the gas , respectively .",

    "the velocity @xmath18 in the inertial frame is obtained from @xmath19 . in order to focus on the bar - driven gas dynamics",
    ", we do not consider star formation and the associated gas recycling in the present work .",
    "the external gravitational potential @xmath9 consists of four components : an axisymmetric stellar disk , a spherical bulge , a non - axisymmetric bar , and a central supermassive bh .",
    "appendix [ sec : appen ] describes the specific potential model we employ for each component of the galaxy .",
    "the bar pattern speed is taken to be @xmath20 . without a central bh ,",
    "our galaxy model is similar to those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the presence of a bh allows us to explore the effect of central mass concentration on the formation of nuclear spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the real interstellar gas is multiphase and turbulent , with temperatures differing by a few orders of magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for simplicity , we model this highly inhomogeneous gas using an isothermal equation of state with an effective sound speed @xmath0 that includes a contribution due to turbulent motions .",
    "we have calculated 15 different models in which we vary both @xmath0 and the initial mass @xmath21 of the central bh as parameters .",
    "table [ tbl : model ] lists the properties of each calculation . the sound speed is chosen to vary between 5 and @xmath22 .",
    "models with a postfix bh0 do not initially possess a central bh , and are similar to those in @xcite .",
    "models with the postfix bh7 or bh8 have a bh with mass @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively ; they are analogous to models in @xcite and @xcite . for most models",
    ", we fix the bh mass to its initial value , but we also consider three additional models ( cs05bh0 t , cs20bh0 t , and cs20bh7 t ) in which the bh mass is varied with time according to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the mass inflow rate across the inner boundary ( see below ) .",
    "these time - varying @xmath1 models allow us to study the effect of bh growth due to the gas accretion on bar substructures .",
    "figure [ fig : rotcurve ] plots the net circular rotation curves together with a contribution from each component when @xmath27 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are along the bar major and minor axes , respectively .",
    "the circular velocity is almost flat at @xmath28 in the outer parts . without the bh ,",
    "the rotation curve @xmath29 would rise linearly with @xmath11 close to the center , but the presence of the bh results in @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "this rapid increase of @xmath29 will render the gaseous orbits in the very central regions highly resistant to pressure perturbations , resulting in smaller mass inflow rates than the cases without it , as we show below .",

    "the horizontal dotted line in each panel represents the bar patten speed of @xmath20 , with the corotation resonance ( cr ) located at @xmath39 for all models . for bh0 models with no bh , the @xmath32 curve peaks at @xmath40 and is equal to @xmath41 at the two ilr with radii of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . because the rotation curve rises steeply toward the center , bh7 and bh8 models have only a single ilr at @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath32 curve in bh7 models attains its local maximum and minimum at @xmath40 and @xmath45 , respectively . in bh8 models ,",
    "on the other hand , it increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath11 since the bh dominates the gravitational potential .",
    "we will show in section [ sec : nsp ] that the shape of nuclear spirals depends critically on the sign of @xmath46 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      to solve equations ( [ eq : con ] ) and ( [ eq : mom ] ) , we use the two - dimensional grid - based code cmhog in cylindrical geometry @xcite . cmhog implements the piecewise parabolic method in its lagrangian remap formulation @xcite , which is third - order accurate in space and",
    "has very little numerical diffusion ( viscosity ) .",
    "all the runs are carried out in a frame corotating with a bar whose major axis is aligned along the @xmath47-axis ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) , so that the bar potential remains stationary in the simulation domain . by assuming a reflection symmetry with respect to the galaxy center , the simulations were performed on a half - plane with @xmath49 constructed by making a cut along the bar major axis .    as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , the original version of cmhog used by @xcite contained a serious bug in the way the gravitational forces were added to the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the cmhog code places a bar potential @xmath50 with the major axis aligned along the @xmath51-axis , calculate the bar forces @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and then transforms them into cylindrical coordinates . in the original version of the code , the incorrect transform relations @xmath54 and @xmath55 were used .",
    "in fact , the correct transformation rule for the azimuthal force should be @xmath56 . with the sign of the azimuthal force reversed ( but the radial force correct ) , the flows in models computed using the original cmhog code behave as if the bar potential were aligned parallel to the @xmath47-axis , but with forces quite different from the intended ones .",
    "other than these force transformations , the complex hydrodynamic algorithms in cmhog are all implemented correctly , and were well tested in the original paper by @xcite .",
    "therefore , previous numerical studies based on cmhog should remain valid as long as they did not adopt the incorrect transformations of the bar forces inherited from @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the results of @xcite were compromised by a trivial sign error in the coordinate transform relations for the bar forces .",
    "figure 3 compares the results for a typical simulation run with the original and corrected version of cmhog . for this test",
    ", the grid resolution is taken identical to that in @xcite with 251 and 154 zones in the radial and azimuthal directions , respectively .",
    "the figure plots the logarithm of the surface density at @xmath57 myr .",
    "several differences are apparent .",
    "for example , the gas around the corotation resonance ( cr ) at @xmath58 in the left panel is largely evacuated and has corrugated streams linked to the ends of the bar major axis , whereas the cr region is relatively featureless in the right panel .",
    "the nuclear ring in the left panel is fairly smooth , while it is quite clumpy in the right panel .",
    "most importantly , the very central region inside the ring is almost unperturbed in the left panel , while the right panel shows spiral structures in the central region .",
    "these differences suggest that the original cmhog code is unable to properly model the flow in the central regions , especially weak nuclear spirals .",
    "we have also run the same model using other grid - based codes adopting cartesian coordinates , such as tvd @xcite and antares @xcite as well as the particle - based gadget code @xcite , in all of which the bar forces are calculated by taking finite differences of @xmath50 rather than using @xmath59 and @xmath60 directly .",
    "the new version of the cmhog code used in this work gives results which are much more similar to the results of these other codes , which gives us further confidence that the gravitational forces due to the bar are now being treated correctly .    to resolve the central regions",
    "accurately , we set up a non - uniform , logarithmically - spaced cylindrical grid with 1024 radial zones extending from @xmath61 to @xmath62 and 480 azimuthal zones covering the half - plane .",
    "this makes the zones approximately square - shaped throughout the grid ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) .",
    "the resulting grid spacing is @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 at the inner radial boundary , @xmath67 where nuclear rings typically form , and the outer radial boundary , respectively .",
    "this increases the resolution in the inner regions by over an order of magnitude , in comparison to the models presented in @xcite .",
    "this level of grid resolution is crucial to resolve nuclear spiral structures within @xmath67 .",
    "we use outflow and continuous boundary conditions at the inner and outer radial boundaries , respectively , while the azimuthal boundaries are periodic .",
    "the gas crossing the inner boundary is considered lost from the simulation domain .",
    "we keep track of the total mass crossing the inner boundary in order to study the mass inflow rates into the galactic nucleus .",
    "each model starts from a uniform disk with surface density @xmath68 that is rotating in force balance with an axisymmetric gravitational potential without a bar . in order to avoid strong transients in the fluid flow caused by a sudden introduction of the bar ,",
    "we slowly introduce the bar potential over one bar revolution time of @xmath69 myr .",
    "this is accomplished by increasing the bar central density @xmath70 linearly with time and decreasing the bulge central density @xmath71 , while keeping the net central density @xmath72 fixed .",
    "this ensures that the shape of the total gravitational potential @xmath9 , when averaged along the azimuthal direction , is unchanged with time .",
    "all the models are run until 500 myr .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath73 and 10 orbits at the inner and outer radial boundaries , respectively , for bh8 models with @xmath27 .",
    "we take model cs05bh0 with @xmath74 and no bh as our standard model .",
    "the overall evolution of other models with different @xmath0 and @xmath1 are qualitatively similar , although the properties of the nuclear features that form differ considerably from model to model . in this section ,",
    "we first describe the evolution of our standard model , and then present the differences in the off - axis shocks and nuclear rings caused by differing @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the properties of nuclear spirals will be given in section [ sec : nsp ] .",
    "figure [ fig : snap ] plots snapshots of the logarithm of the gas density at a few selected epochs in the inner regions of model cs05bh0 .",
    "the bar is oriented vertically along the @xmath47-axis , and the gas is rotating in the counterclockwise direction relative to the bar .",
    "the images extend to 6 kpc on either side of the center , corresponding to the cr radius , outside of which the gas remains almost unperturbed . ] .",
    "@xcite found that the cr regions exhibit time - dependent flow structures , as reproduced in figure [ fig : comp_ori_new]a .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig : snap ] shows that the cr regions in our simulations are quite stable and exhibit only at late time low - amplitude wavelike features entrained by the dense gas located at the bar ends , similar to the results of sph simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the complicated structures seen in @xcite were likely an artifact of the errors in their force transformation .",
    "a striking feature of each of the snapshots shown in figure [ fig : snap ] at times greater than 120 myr is large amplitude oscillations in the density in the ring and dust lanes .",
    "these features are also seen in the simulations of @xcite for spiral shocks , and are attributed to the  wiggle instability \" . as we will discuss below , this shock instability appears to be caused by vorticity generation in curved shocks .",
    "an introduction of the non - axisymmetric bar potential induces perturbations on the gas orbits , causing them to deviate from circular trajectories .",
    "the gas density increases ( decreases ) in regions where neighboring orbits come close together ( diverge ) . when @xmath75 myr , the overdense regions are preferentially located downstream from the bar major axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snap]a ) . at this time",
    ", the overdensity produced by orbit crowding is largest at @xmath76 . since the perturbing force by the bar is weak inside @xmath77 , the overdensity there is correspondingly small and not readily discernible . over time , the overdense regions become narrower and sharper as the bar amplitude grows and eventually develop into shock fronts at around @xmath78 myr . in what follows , we term these narrow shocks off - axis shocks .",
    "a nuclear ring is beginning to shape at this time , as well . to illustrate the formation of nuclear rings in our models , we plot as solid lines in figure [ fig : stream ] instantaneous streamlines of the gas that starts from point a marked at @xmath79 in model cs05bh0 and from @xmath80 in model cs20bh0 with @xmath81 and no bh at @xmath78 myr .",
    "the two dotted circles in figure [ fig : stream]a indicate the inner and outer ilrs at @xmath42 and @xmath82 . note that the thick lines representing the overdense ridges in both models directly cross the outer ilr .",
    "the changes of the azimuthal and radial velocities along the streamlines are shown in figure [ fig : stream]b , c , where the dotted line indicates the equilibrium rotation curve of the model galaxy with no bh .",
    "on emerging from the overdense region ( point a ) , the gas moves radially inward on its epicycle orbit and increases ( decreases ) its azimuthal ( radial ) velocity due to the coriolis force .",
    "it reaches point b closest to the center when it attains @xmath83 and largest @xmath84 .",
    "after this point , it moves radially outward , decreasing @xmath84 until it hits the off - axis shock at point c. the gas loses a significant amount of angular momentum at the shock and begins to fall in .",
    "in addition , the shocked gas is swept by other shocked gas flowing from the bar end regions along the shocks .",
    "note that the shape of the off - axis shocks shown in figure [ fig : stream]a coincides with the gas streamline from points c to d , indicating that all the gas after crossing the shocks moves radially in along the shock fronts in the developing stage of the nuclear rings .    as the shocked gas moves along the shock fronts from point c",
    ", it gradually rotates faster again .",
    "when the azimuthal velocity of the gas is increased to the level comparable to the equilibrium circular velocity at some radius @xmath11 , it begins to follow a closed orbit ( point d ) , forming a nuclear ring at that radius .",
    "in other words , the centrifugal barrier inhibits the inflowing gas from moving further in .",
    "regardless of the bh mass , this happens at @xmath85 in models with @xmath74 and @xmath86 in models with @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snap]b , c ) .",
    "the facts that the off - axis shocks penetrate the ilr in bh7/bh8 models , the outer ilr in bh0 models , and that the ring positions are almost independent of @xmath1 when the rings are beginning to form suggest that the ring formation is unlikely to be governed by resonances . for models with low sound speed ,",
    "the shape of nuclear rings is similar to an @xmath2-orbit .",
    "clearly , the presence of the nuclear ring prevents the shocked gas from infalling directly to the nucleus .",
    "since the off - axis shocks are curved , crocco s theorem ensures that vorticity can be generated at the shock fronts .",
    "figure [ fig : pvort ] plots snapshots of the potential vorticity @xmath87 relative to the initial value @xmath88 near the shocks at @xmath89 , 100 , 110 , and 120 myr of the standard model . at @xmath89 myr",
    ", @xmath90 is largest along the shocks .",
    "vorticity produced at the shocks is advected with the background flows and enters the shock fronts at the opposite side after a half revolution .",
    "vorticity grows secularly with time by successive passages across the shocks .",
    "when vorticity achieves substantial amplitudes , it causes the shock fronts to wiggle and fragment into small clumps with high vorticity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snap]c ) .",
    "the process of clump formation along the shocks in our models bears remarkable resemblance to the wiggle instability of spiral shocks found by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these clumps are carried radially inward and add to the nuclear ring , making the latter fairly inhomogeneous ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snap]d , e ) .",
    "the off - axis shocks shown in figure [ fig : stream ] are not stationary largely because the bar potential is not fully turned on yet . as the strength of the bar potential keeps increasing , they become stronger and move slowly toward the bar major axis .",
    "gas that is added to the ring from the off - axis shocks has increasingly lower angular momentum with time , causing the ring to shrink in radius with time .",
    "after the bar potential is fully turned on , the off - axis shocks become gradually weaker as the amount of gas in the mid - bar regions lost to the ring increases with time . at the same time , orbital phase mixing and frequent clump collisions in the ring make the latter rounder and align its semimajor axis in the direction perpendicular to the bar major axis .",
    "note that the rings are always attached to the inner end of the off - axis shocks .    at @xmath91 myr ,",
    "model cs05bh0 reaches a quasi - steady state in the sense that temporal changes in the overall flow pattern are very slow , and the locations of the shocks and rings do not vary much with time .",
    "figure [ fig : snap]f overplots some of the @xmath92-orbits ( dotted curves aligned vertically ) and @xmath2-orbits ( solid curves aligned horizontally ) , showing that the shape of the nuclear ring matches well with an @xmath2-orbit , while the off - axis shocks closely follow one of the @xmath92-orbits over the whole length of the shocks .",
    "this is because when @xmath74 the impact of thermal pressure on the gas orbits is much smaller than that of the gravitational and centrifugal forces , so that pure orbit theory ( neglecting pressure forces ) is a good description .",
    "when @xmath93 , however , thermal pressure gradients strongly affect gas orbits , and thus the morphology of substructures in the central regions are modified , as we will discuss below .",

    "the off - axis shocks are almost parallel to @xmath92-orbits .",
    "they start from the bar major axis at the outer ends , offset toward downstream in the mid - bar regions , and connect to the nuclear rings at the inner ends .",
    "the mean offset of off - axis shocks from the bar major axis is larger for models with smaller @xmath0 .",
    "the outer end regions of the off - axis shocks have complicated density structures including the `` 4/1-spiral shocks '' marked with a red arrow in figure [ fig : csvar]a @xcite and the enhanced density ridges ( a white arrow ) termed `` smudges '' by @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the 4/1-spiral shocks are produced by collisions of gas moving on @xmath92-orbits with that on the 4/1-resonant family ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the gas loses angular momentum at the shocks and subsequently switches to lower orbits . as the streamlines in green display , in models with @xmath74 , the 4/1-spiral shocks are quite strong and spatially extended , so that the orbits after the shocks become relatively radial and converge at the opposite side of the bar , building a smudge after about a half revolution .",
    "collisions of streams off the 4/1-spiral shock and the smudge on the same side of the bar funnel the gas at the intersections to an @xmath92-orbit , which are the starting points of the off - axis shocks . when @xmath81 , on the other hand , the 4/1-spiral shocks are short and weak , and the streamlines off the shocks diverge , so that a dense ridge does not form . since the gas becomes less compressible with increasing @xmath0 , steady off - axis shocks in models with large @xmath0 can be supported only in inner regions where the bar perturbations are sufficiently strong .",
    "this explains why the mean offset of the off - axis shocks from the bar major axis becomes smaller as @xmath0 increases ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with weak 4/1-spiral shocks and no smudge ,",
    "the gas in the bar - end regions in model with @xmath81 is comparatively unsteady , sometimes generating small dense blobs that move inward along the off - axis shocks .    to quantify the shock properties , we place a slit in each model , indicated by the short white lines in figure [ fig : csvar ] .",
    "the slit starts from @xmath104 and runs perpendicular to the local segment of the off - axis shocks , roughly at @xmath105 .",

    "it is apparent that the off - axis shocks tend to move toward the bar major axis with increasing @xmath0 , while there is no clear dependence of @xmath108 on the bh mass .",
    "the compression factor at the shock is insensitive to @xmath1 and scales roughly with @xmath0 as @xmath115 .",
    "naively , one would expect that the off - axis shocks become weaker as the sound speed increases , since the density jump in planer isothermal shocks is proportional to @xmath116 . however , this is not the case , as figure [ fig : slit ] and table [ tbl : shock ] demonstrate .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "firstly , it is the velocity component normal to the shock front @xmath117 that determines the shock jump conditions , and because the inclination angle of the streamlines which enter the shock varies with location and with @xmath0 , @xmath117 varies in a complicated fashion .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : slit ] shows that for off - axis shocks formed at @xmath118 , model cs15bh0 with @xmath119 has the largest peak density as well as the largest @xmath120 and @xmath121 . on the other hand ,",
    "model cs10bh0 has the smallest @xmath122 ( with @xmath123 ) and thus the lowest density enhancement . since the sound speed is lower , model cs05bh0 with @xmath122 produces @xmath109 comparable to that in model cs15bh0 .",
    "secondly , we note that the rankin - hugoniot jump conditions for stationary planar shocks are not applicable to the curved and two - dimensional off - axis shocks formed in our simulations . as figure [ fig : csvar ]",
    "displays , the flows are fully two - dimensional in the sense that streamlines diverge before the shocks , and converge after the shock with the radial inflow coming from the regions near the end of the bar . the fact that the compression factor @xmath124 measured at the shock front is smaller than @xmath125 expected from planer isothermal shocks also indicates that the shocks are two dimensional . finally , the density and velocity fluctuations generated by the vortex - generating instability are important around the off - axis shocks especially for models with small @xmath0 , so that the flows are not strictly stationary right after the shocks in model cs10bh0 shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : slit ] are due to vortices produced by the instability . ] .",
    "note that the shocked gas has strong velocity shear , amounting to @xmath126 , which is about 10 times larger than the velocity shear arising from galaxy rotation in the solar neighborhood .",
    "such strong shear can stabilize the high - density , off - axis shocks against self - gravity .",

    "the left panels of figure [ fig : mdot_mbht ] compare @xmath26 from models cs05bh0 t and cs20bh0 t with those from the fixed-@xmath1 counterparts , while the bottom panels plot the temporal evolution of the bh mass in the former models . in model cs05bh0 t",
    ", the total gas mass accreted over 500 myr is @xmath251 , with the corresponding increment of the equilibrium rotational velocity of @xmath252 at the inner boundary .",

    "the rignt panels of figure [ fig : mdot_mbht ] show , the increase of @xmath1 over 500 myr in model cs20bh7 t is less than a factor of two , corresponding to the equilibrium circular velocity 1.3 times the initial value . with an enhanced centrifugal barrier",
    ", the resulting @xmath26 becomes gradually smaller than the case with fixed @xmath1 , but by less than , on average , @xmath255 in @xmath91-@xmath245 myr .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the effect of bh growth due to gas accretion on the mass inflow rate as well as bar substructures is not significant for the models we have considered .",
    "we have presented detailed numerical models that explore the formation of substructures produced by the gas flow in barred galaxies .",
    "previous models based on particle simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) did not have sufficient resolution to resolve nuclear spirals . on the other hand ,",
    "studies that used the grid - based code cmhog ( e.g. , @xcite ) unknowingly made mistakes in the force evaluation for the bar potential , so that the results needed to be recomputed .    in this paper",
    "we have corrected the errors in the original cmhog code and run high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations . to resolve the nuclear regions ,",
    "we employ a logarithmically - spaced cylindrical grid , with a zone size of @xmath256 at @xmath168 where nuclear rings and spirals form .",
    "we have included the potential from a central bh , and studied the flow properties as the mass of the bh @xmath1 and the sound speed @xmath0 in the gas are varied . for simplicity , the effects of gaseous self - gravity and magnetic fields are not included .",
    "the main results of the present work are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "_ off - axis shocks _  the imposed non - axisymmetric bar potential provides gravitational torques to the otherwise circular - rotating gas , perturbing its orbit . the perturbed orbits crowd at the downstream sides of the bar major axis and produce overdense ridges that eventually develop into off - axis shocks . at a quasi - steady state ,",
    "the off - axis shocks are overall almost parallel to @xmath92-orbits : they start from the bar major axis at the outer ends , are gradually displaced downstream as they move inward , and connect to the nuclear ring at the inner ends . while the positions of the off - axis shocks are almost independent of @xmath1 , since the effect of a bh is negligible at large radii , they depend on @xmath0 in such a way that the shocks are , on average , located closer to the bar major axis as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is primarily because gas with larger @xmath0 should be more strongly perturbed to induce shocks , which occurs deeper in the potential well and thus results in shocks on lower @xmath92-orbits @xcite .",
    "the off - axis shocks are in general curved .",
    "flow streamlines are complicated near the shocks in that they diverge before the shocks and are promptly swept inwards by inflowing gas right after the shocks .",
    "therefore , the usual ranking - hugoniot jump conditions for planar , one - dimensional shocks are not applicable to the off - axis shocks .",
    "in fact , the shock strength , as measured by the peak density @xmath109 at @xmath105 from the center , is @xmath257 for models with no bh and do not sensitively depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the compression factor of the off - axis shocks are insensitive to the bh mass and depends on @xmath0 roughly as @xmath115 .",
    "the off - axis shocks have very strong velocity shear amounting to @xmath258 .",
    "this strong shear may suppress the growth of gravitational instability in the high - density off - axis shocks when self - gravity is included .",
    "_ nuclear rings _ ",
    "when gas passes through the off - axis shocks , it loses angular momentum , flows inward , and forms a nuclear ring where the centrifugal force balances the external gravity .",
    "the ring is attached to the inner ends of the off - axis shocks and thus becomes smaller in size as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the rings that form in our models are all located inside the ( outer ) ilr , but this does not imply that the ring formation is related to the ilrs .",
    "when @xmath0 is small , the pressure perturbations on the gas orbits are so weak that the rings are quite narrow and their shape is well described by @xmath2-orbits .",
    "the mean radius is @xmath259 when @xmath74 and @xmath260 when @xmath146 , independent of the bh mass .",
    "this suggests that the ring position is not determined by the @xmath32 curve , hence by the ilrs .",
    "when @xmath248 , on the other hand , large thermal pressure strongly affects the gas orbits in the nuclear rings .",
    "for example , some gas near the contact points between the ring and the off - axis shocks is forced out to follow relatively round orbits , while other gas is pulled in radially to make very eccentric orbits .",
    "these diverse gas orbits near the contact points tend to spread out the ring material , making the rings much broader than in models with smaller @xmath0 .",
    "_ nuclear spirals _ ",
    "since even the non - axisymmetric bar potential is nearly axisymmetric in the central parts , the gaseous responses inside a nuclear ring are not as dramatic as in off - axis shocks . nevertheless , non - axisymmetric @xmath6 perturbations are able to grow inside a ring and develop into nuclear spirals that persist for a long period of time , provided that @xmath0 is small or @xmath1 is large .",
    "although all models have weak spiral structures at early time , in models with large @xmath0 they are soon destroyed by eccentric gas orbits as well as perturbations induced by the large pressure in the rings unless the bh mass is very large .",
    "when @xmath27 , the disruptive pressure perturbations from the rings can not penetrate the very central parts where the gas has extremely large initial angular momentum . in this case , the nuclear spirals are protected from the surrounding and thus are long - lived .",
    "the shape of nuclear spirals is determined by the sign of @xmath46 such that spirals that form in the regions where @xmath46 is positive ( negative ) are leading ( trailing ) , confirming the theoretical expectations of @xcite . with no bh , only the model with @xmath74 has persistent leading spirals in the regions where the @xmath32 curve is an increasing function of @xmath11 .",
    "the leading spirals in this model are quite strong and develop into shocks with the peak density @xmath261 and the compression factor @xmath262 at @xmath176 at the end of the run .",
    "models with @xmath129 initially have hybrid features comprising of trailing spirals at @xmath195 and leading spirals at @xmath194 , where @xmath135 and @xmath134 refer to the radii where @xmath32 curve attains a local minimum and maximum , respectively .",
    "when @xmath263 , however , the leading parts in the hybrid spirals are destroyed by the trailing pressure waves launched by the ring , leaving only the weak trailing spirals behind . when @xmath213 , both leading and trailing spirals are destructed completely by the pressure perturbations .",
    "in models with @xmath27 , @xmath264 in the whole nuclear regions , so that nuclear rings are always trailing . when @xmath263 , the spirals well separated from the ring are weak and tightly wound .",
    "when @xmath213 , on the other hand , the trailing spirals are fed by the gas in the nuclear ring and grow into shocks , the outer ends of which join the inner ends of the off - axis shocks smoothly .",
    "although the nuclear spirals in these models have only modest density contrasts of @xmath265 at @xmath222 , the background density resulting from the inflows of the ring material is greatly enhanced ( by more than two orders of magnitude when @xmath81 ) .",
    "\\4 . _ mass inflow rates _ ",
    "although gas experiences a significant loss in angular momentum when it meets off - axis shocks during galaxy rotation , this does not necessarily translate into the mass inflow all the way to the galaxy center . in models with @xmath263 , a narrow nuclear ring formed by gas with @xmath2-orbits",
    "inhibits further inflows of the gas , resulting in the mass inflow rate @xmath26 through the inner boundary less than @xmath3 , regardless of the bh mass .",
    "the mass inflow rates are greatly enhanced to @xmath266 in models with @xmath267 and @xmath213 or @xmath27 and @xmath81 for different reasons depending on the bh mass .",
    "when @xmath268 , the gas orbits are affected by thermal pressure and some gas in the ring can take highly eccentric orbits , directly falling into the inner boundary . in models with @xmath269 , on the other hand ,",
    "the gas orbits near the center are more or less circular , but the density in the nuclear regions is enhanced greatly because of strong nuclear spirals , increasing @xmath26 .",
    "nuclear rings play an important role in evolution of barred galaxies by providing sites of active star formation near the centers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rings certainly consist of gas that migrates from outer parts inward by losing angular momentum at off - axis shocks , but what stops further migration to form a ring remains a matter of debate . as a trapping mechanism of the ring material , @xcite proposed the non - axisymmetric bar toque that forces gas to accumulate between two ilrs or at a single ilr depending on the shape of the gravitational potential ( see also @xcite ) , while @xcite favored the gas transitions from @xmath92- to @xmath2-orbits rather than orbital resonances",
    "however , our numerical results show that a ring is formed at early time because of the centrifugal barrier that the migrating material feels . later on ,",
    "nuclear rings slowly shrink in size as gas with lower angular momentum gas is continuously added .",
    "although nuclear rings are located in between two ilrs in models with no bh , this is a coincidence .",
    "models with a central bh show that the specific ring positions are insensitive to the shape of the @xmath32 curves , suggesting that nuclear ring formation is not a consequence of the orbital resonances .",
    "in fact , the gas flows that produce the ring are not in force balance and have a large radial velocity , so that the concept of resonances and ilrs is not applicable to nuclear rings ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the notion of @xmath2-orbits as the gas trapping locations is meaningful only for small @xmath0 .. ] when the sound speed is large , thermal pressure at the contact points between the off - axis shocks and nuclear ring causes the gas orbits to deviate from @xmath2-orbits considerably .",
    "the results of our simulations suggest that not all barred - galaxies possess nuclear spirals at their centers .",
    "long - lasing nuclear spirals exist only when either the sound speed is small or the bh mass is large : they do not survive in models with _ both _",
    "large @xmath0 _ and _ small @xmath1 .",
    "two common views regarding the nature of nuclear spirals are low - amplitude density waves and strong gaseous shocks ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . and , our simulations indeed show that they are either tightly - wound density waves or shocks when the pith angle is relatively large ( @xmath270 ) .",
    "one may speculate that nuclear spirals are more likely to be shocks rather than density waves when @xmath0 is small .",
    "in contrast to this prediction , however , nuclear spirals in models with @xmath27 are density waves when @xmath0 is small and shocks when @xmath0 is large .",
    "this is of course because as @xmath0 increases , waves in nuclear regions tend to be more open ( with smaller @xmath271 ) in the beginning , and they are subsequently supplied with more gas from the rings as they grow .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the results of @xcite who used sph simulations to show that nuclear spirals are supported by shocks when @xmath93 in models with a massive bh .",
    "we note however that weak trailing spirals seen in our model cs10bh8 are absent in model m2 ( @xmath146 and @xmath27 ) of @xcite , which is presumably due to an insufficient number of particles to resolve nuclear spirals in their sph simulations .",
    "of 12 models with differing @xmath0 and @xmath21 that we have considered , only 1 model possesses leading spirals , suggesting that galaxies with leading nuclear spirals would be very uncommon in nature . to our knowledge , only two galaxies , ngc 1241 and ngc 6902 , are known to possess leading features in the nuclear regions @xcite emissions tracing young stars , while those in ngc 6902 are observed in the k@xmath272 band tracing old populations .",
    "it is uncertain how these stellar features are related to gaseous nuclear spirals studied in this paper . ] .",
    "based on our simulations , the existence of leading spirals at centers requires two stringent conditions : ( 1 ) the gas should be dynamically cold enough to protect nuclear spirals from nuclear rings and ( 2 ) there should be a wide range of radii with @xmath264 in the central parts , which can be easily accomplished when there are two ilrs ( or without a strong central mass concentration ) .",
    "the second condition is consistent with the linear theory that predicts short leading waves propagating outward from the inner ilr @xcite .",
    "the facts that ngc 6902 is a barred - spiral galaxy @xcite and does not show significant @xmath273-ray emissions indicative of agn activities @xcite are not inconsistent with the second requirement for the existence of leading nuclear spirals . since ngc 1241 is a seyfert 2 galaxy with an estimated bh mass of @xmath274 @xcite , however , the nuclear star - forming regions in this galaxy are unlikely to be associated with gaseous nuclear spirals studied in this work .    finally , we discuss the mass inflow rates derived in our models in regard to powering agns in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the mass accretion rate is often measured by the eddington ratio defined by @xmath275 , where @xmath276 and @xmath277 denote the bolometric and eddington luminosities of an agn and @xmath278 is the mass - to - energy conversion efficiency of the accreted material .",
    "observations indicate that @xmath279 for classical seyfert 1 galaxies with broad iron emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , while @xmath280 for low - luminosity seyfert 1 agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our numerical models , the mass inflow rates are larger for models with smaller @xmath1 and larger @xmath0 .",
    "taking @xmath281 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the mass inflow rates amount to @xmath282 for @xmath27 and @xmath283 , @xmath284 for @xmath27 and @xmath81 or for @xmath129 and @xmath146 , and @xmath285 for @xmath129 and @xmath93 . for classical seyfert galaxies with strong bars",
    ", this suggests that the masses of central bhs are likely to be less than @xmath286 , which appears to be consistent with the measured values from the relation between the bh masses and the velocity dispersions of stellar bulges ( e.g. , @xcite ) and reverberation mapping techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) . of course",
    ", this result may depend on many factors such as the axis ratio and strength of the bar , presence of self - gravity and magnetic fields , gas cooling and heating , turbulence , etc .",
    ", all of which would affect gas dynamic significantly .",

    "<S> the stars and dark matter are represented by a static gravitational potential with four components : a stellar disk , the bulge , a central bh , and the bar . to investigate various galactic environments , we vary the gas sound speed @xmath0 as well as the mass of the central bh @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> once the flow has reached a quasi - steady state , off - axis shocks tend to move closer to the bar major axis as @xmath0 increases . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear rings shrink in size with increasing @xmath0 , but are independent of @xmath1 , suggesting that ring position is not determined by the lindblad resonances . </S>",
    "<S> rings in low-@xmath0 models are narrow since they are occupied largely by gas on @xmath2-orbits and well decoupled from nuclear spirals , while they become broad because of large thermal perturbations in high-@xmath0 models . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear spirals persist only when either @xmath0 is small or @xmath1 is large ; they would otherwise be destroyed completely by the ring material on eccentric orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the shape and strength of nuclear spirals depend sensitively on @xmath0 and @xmath1 such that they are leading if both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are small , weak trailing if @xmath0 is small and @xmath1 is large , and strong trailing if both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are large . while the mass inflow rate toward the nucleus is quite small in low-@xmath0 models because of the presence of a narrow nuclear ring , it becomes larger than @xmath3 when @xmath0 is large , providing a potential explanation of nuclear activity in seyfert galaxies . </S>"
