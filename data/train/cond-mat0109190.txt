    "fracture in disordered media has for many years attracted much scientific and industrial interest @xcite .",
    "an important class of models of material failure is the fiber - bundle models ( fbm ) which have been extensively studied during the past decades @xcite .",
    "these models consist of a set of parallel fibers having statistically distributed strengths .",
    "the sample is loaded parallel to the fiber direction , and a fiber fails if the load acting on it exceeds a strength threshold value .",
    "when a fiber fails , its load is transferred to other surviving fibers in the bundle , according to a specific transfer rule . among the possible options of load transfer , one simplification that makes",
    "the problem analytically tractable is the assumption of equal load sharing ( els ) , or global load transfer , which means that after each fiber breaks , its stress is equally distributed among the intact fibers .",
    "until very recently , the failure rule applied in standard fbm was discontinuous and irreversible , i.e. , when the local load exceeds the failure threshold of a fiber , the fiber is removed from the calculation and is never restored .",
    "recently , a novel continuous damage law was incorporated into these models @xcite .",
    "thus , when the strength threshold of a fiber is exceeded , it yields , and the elastic modulus of the fiber is reduced by a factor @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "multiple yields of a given fiber are allowed , up to a maximum of @xmath3 yielding events per fiber , where @xmath3 is a small integer number which can be different for each fiber .",
    "this generalization of the standard fbm is suitable to describe a variety of elasto - plastic constitutive behaviors @xcite .",
    "the standard fbms simulate the failure of a system at the _ microscopic _ level .",
    "each fiber breakage can be mapped onto a new microcrack ( with a typical size of a few @xmath4 m ) , or onto the extension of a previous microcrack . on the other hand ,",
    "the continuous damage fbms simulate failure at a _ mesoscopic _ level .",
    "now , each fiber in the model can be viewed as a small volume of the material . the term `` small '' depends on the size of the heterogeneities , but can be of the order of one millimeter for rocks . in each of these representative elementary volumes ( revs )",
    "in which the total volume can be divided , there are many potential sites for crack nucleation and growth , and the addition of each new crack will change continuously the elastic properties of the rev until its final failure when the accumulated damage surpasses a threshold .",
    "this threshold is identified in our model with the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "another important parameter in the model , the stiffness reduction factor , @xmath1 , controls the amount of weakening that each yielding event introduces in a rev .",
    "the value @xmath5 means no weakening , so that the elastic modulus of the rev remains the same irrespective of the number of yieldings , a rather unphysical situation . at the other extreme ,",
    "the value @xmath6 means complete weakening after the first yield event .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is the physically meaningful range for the stiffness reduction factor . in all the results given in the following sections",
    ", we have assumed that the initial elastic module of all the revs is unity and that @xmath3 is the same for all the fibers .",
    "the randomness is incorporated in the revs liftimes , not in the elastic moduli .",
    "fbms come in two settings , static and time - dependent or dynamic , and both of them have been applied to the standard and continuous damage settings @xcite .",
    "the static version of fbm simulates the failure of materials by quasistatic loading . drawing an analogy with what is carried out in a deformation experiment in the laboratory",
    ", a static fbm simulates a uniaxial or triaxial , compressive or tensile , deformation test where the duration of the test is measured in seconds or minutes . in these models , the stress on each fiber is the independent variable and the strength of each element is the distributed random variable . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamic fbm simulates failure by creep rupture , static fatigue , or delayed rupture , i.e. , a ( usually ) constant load is imposed on the system and the elements break because of fatigue after a period of time .",
    "the time elapsed until the system collapses is the lifetime of the bundle .",
    "time acts as an independent variable , and the initial lifetime of each element , for a prescribed initial stress , is the independent identically distributed random quantity .",
    "again , we can draw a clear analogy with a particular type of deformation experiments in the laboratory , the so - called creep experiments , where a heterogeneous material ( rock , concrete , composite , ceramic alloy ) is subjected to a constant or cyclic load , breaking after a period of time .",
    "the duration of these tests depends on the load imposed on the material and , more exactly , on the load compared to the short - term strength of the material ( _ i.e. _ , the load that causes the `` instantaneous '' failure of the same material in a fast uniaxial experiment ) .",
    "this load is usually expressed as a percentage of the short - term strength and the duration of the experiments is critically dependent on it",
    ". for rock , say , a sample will fail by creep after a few hours when subjected to a load 80% of the short - term strength , after a few weeks for a load 70% of the short - term strength , and after a few months or even years for lower working loads . the mechanism behind creep failure is _ subcritical crack growth _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the slow extension of microcracks with lengths smaller than the critical crack length for instantaneous failure",
    ". subcritical crack growth is due to a variety of processes operating near crack tips , the most important of them being _ stress corrosion _ , a chemical interaction between the crack tip and the environmental species , notably water , filling the microcracks that provokes the hydrolytic weakening of the atomic bonds of the material in the crack tip , where stress concentrations are highest .",
    "the crack propagation velocity is extremely sensitive to the applied load , suggesting exponential or power - law velocity functions with large coefficients or exponents .",
    "indeed , in the dynamic fbms the most widely used breaking rate function is the power law @xcite , in which elements break at a rate proportional to a power of their stress , @xmath8 , where the exponent @xmath9 is an integer called the stress corrosion exponent , for obvious reasons .",
    "this type of breaking rate will be assumed here and is another parameter of the model .",
    "our generalization of the dynamic global fbm @xcite was restricted to the global transfer modality , and there we assumed that the size of the bundle , @xmath10 , was very large .",
    "this enabled us to formulate the evolution of the system in terms of continuous differential equations .",
    "this type of equation , similar to those appearing in radioactivity , was first used by coleman @xcite , and later in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we supposed an els bundle formed by @xmath10 fibers which breaks because of stress corrosion under the action of an external constant load @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "the breaking rate of the fibers , @xmath13 , is assumed to be of the power - law type , @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the strain of the bundle and @xmath16 represents the initial stiffness of the individual fibers .",
    "the original dynamic fbm was generalized by allowing one fiber to fail more than once , and thus we define the integer @xmath3 as the maximum value of failures allowed per fiber .",
    "besides , as mentioned before , the parameter @xmath1 ( @xmath17 ) represents the factor of reduction in the stiffness of the fibers when they fail . as up to @xmath3 partial yielding events",
    "are permitted per fiber , at any one time the population of fibers will be sorted in @xmath18 lists .",
    "thus @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) denotes the number of elements that have failed @xmath22 times .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the number of elements that have failed @xmath24 times and therefore are inactive ( i.e. , they no longer support any load anymore ) . at @xmath25 , the @xmath10 elements of the bundle form the list @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and at @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the specification , at a given time @xmath30 , of the value of @xmath20 , for @xmath31 , provides the state of the system . in our continuous formulation",
    "the @xmath20 are real positive numbers lower than @xmath10 .",
    "as the external load @xmath32 is supported by the present active fibers , we have @xmath33 and hence @xmath34    the time evolution equations are @xcite : @xmath35 where the ubiquitous constant factor @xmath36 represents @xmath37 .",
    "this is an autonomous differential system .",
    "its solution must fulfill the initial condition @xmath38    an alternative way of introducing a time - dependent rheological response in fbm is that of cruz - hidalgo _ et .",
    "these authors incorporate a viscoelastic constitutive behaviour in their model through the mapping of each fiber to a kelvin - voigt element .",
    "they express the time evolution of the strain in _ each _ fiber by way of a differential equation . in their model",
    ", fibers break irreversibly when they surpass a statistically distributed strain threshold , whereas in our model multiple failures ( yields ) of a fiber are allowed , the variable which is statistically distributed is the lifetime of the fibers , and there is no explicit threshold dynamics .",
    "this different formulation implies that we can formulate the evolution of the system in terms of coupled differential equations , while the authors in ref . @xcite",
    "have necessarily to use monte carlo simulations due to the lack of a global differential equation for the system .    in reference @xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1.3 ] ) were solved by applying a numerical probabilistic method .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present an exact numerical method that solves eq.([eq1.3 ] ) , fulfilling the initial conditions ( [ eq1.4 ] ) .",
    "this method is explained in section [ sec : exact ] . in section [ sec : results ] we present a discussion of the method and of the results .",
    "the reader will find a longer discussion of the physical results in ref .",
    "this paper concentrates on the solution method .",
    "to simplify the notation , we first normalize the variables @xmath39 in terms of the @xmath40 , the differential system to be solved is    @xmath41    a dot on a variable means derivation with respect to time , and @xmath15 and @xmath36 are the same objects as in section [ sec : intro ] :    @xmath42    the system ( [ eq2.2 ] ) admits a reduction of degrees of freedom by eliminating @xmath30 from the last @xmath3 equations and by integrating with respect to @xmath43 :    @xmath44    from eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) we obtain    @xmath45    with @xmath46 in consequence ,    @xmath47    then , the first equation in ( [ eq2.4 ] ) provides the relation @xmath43 versus @xmath30 @xmath48^{\\rho } x_0 } = \\int_{x_0}^{1 } \\frac{\\left ( \\sum_{i=0}^{n } \\alpha_i x_0^{\\kappa^i } \\right)^\\rho}{x_0}dx_0 \\label{eq2.8}\\ ] ] which , in principle , solves the problem because it relates @xmath30 to @xmath43 and hence to any other @xmath49 .",
    "however , the integral ( [ eq2.8 ] ) is , in general , improper for @xmath50 because the integrand is @xmath51 and therefore the numerical relation @xmath30 vs.  @xmath43 is problematic . specifically :    \\a ) if @xmath52 this integral is proper ,    \\b ) if @xmath53 the integral is improper .",
    "+ due to the fact that the convergence occurs iff @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.8 ] ) is always convergent , because in our model of fracture @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 ; due to the fact that @xmath43 decays from 1 to 0 , there exists a time value @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "if ( [ eq2.8 ] ) is improper , we perform the following change of parameter : @xmath59 , such that    @xmath60 ; \\quad j=1,2,\\cdots , n , \\label{eq2.9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . from here",
    "@xmath64    hence @xmath65    @xmath66    with @xmath67 , @xmath68 @xmath69 .    in these circumstances",
    "( [ eq2.11 ] ) and the equation @xmath70 describe @xmath30 , @xmath71 in terms of the @xmath72 parameter , for @xmath73 .",
    "as the integrand of ( [ eq2.12 ] ) is @xmath74 , then    \\a ) if @xmath75 ( [ eq2.12 ] ) is a proper integral ,    \\b ) if @xmath76 ( [ eq2.12 ] ) is an improper integral , but ( [ eq2.12 ] ) is always convergent .",
    "now , as @xmath72 decays to zero , there exists a time instant @xmath77 such that @xmath78 . and by considering the change of parameter @xmath79 given by the conditions    @xmath80 ; \\quad j=1,2,\\cdots , n , \\label{eq2.13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83",
    ", we have    @xmath84    and hence @xmath85    @xmath86    with identical meaning as before for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "then , ( [ eq2.14 ] ) and @xmath89 describe @xmath30 , @xmath71 in terms of @xmath90 , for @xmath91 .",
    "besides , as the integrand of ( [ eq2.15 ] ) is @xmath92 , then    \\a ) if @xmath93 ( [ eq2.15 ] ) is a proper integral ,    \\b ) if @xmath94 ( [ eq2.15 ] ) is an improper integral , but always convergent .",
    "the process followed so far is generalized in the way expressed in table [ tbl1 ] where in the end @xmath95 and therefore @xmath96 whose integrand is @xmath97 , that is , integral ( [ eq2.17 ] ) is always proper .",
    "the simple formalism written in section [ sec : exact ] can be expressed , for example , in a brief program of mathematica and its results graphically appreciated .",
    "we omit here the program but it can be provided on request . by fixing the constants at the following values : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , in fig .  1 the value of the working parameters",
    "@xmath102 are represented vs.  time .",
    "note that their range of definition is from 1 to @xmath103 , except for @xmath104 which ends at 0 for @xmath105 , i.e. , the actual lifetime of the bundle .      the strategy developed in section [ sec : exact ] can be summarized in a few sentences .",
    "first , let us observe fig.[fig2 ] to appreciate the time evolution of the different lists : while @xmath43 monotonously declines from 1 at @xmath25 to 0 at @xmath28 , the lists @xmath49 , @xmath106 start from 0 at @xmath25 , rise to a maximum and then monotonously decline to 0 at @xmath28 ( strictly speaking , all the lists vanish at the same time ) . the last list @xmath107 is special in the sense that it is the only one that tends to 0 with an infinite slope when @xmath30 tends to @xmath108 .",
    "the analytical resolution of eq .  ( [ eq2.2 ] ) is impossible because of the nonlinearity introduced by the @xmath109 factors .",
    "this source of complexity is partly overcome after having recognized the partial reduction of degrees of freedom expressed in ( [ eq2.4 ] ) .",
    "this partial reduction leads to the relation between @xmath49 , @xmath110 and @xmath43 , hence from ( [ eq2.8 ] ) one has solved in principle the time evolution of @xmath43 , and of the rest of @xmath49 .",
    "but , in ( [ eq2.8 ] ) one also recognizes that this integral is improper .",
    "this is the _ real problem _ we face for the numerical inversion @xmath111 in the region where @xmath43 is very small . in intuitive terms , this shows in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] because beyond a certain time , @xmath43 is no longer significant and its relation with @xmath30 becomes `` delicate '' .",
    "therefore we have used @xmath112 as a good integration parameter only up to @xmath113 . beyond this point",
    "we successively introduced other `` artificial parameters '' @xmath114 which in the corresponding time interval play the role performed by @xmath43 from 0 to @xmath115 . using these parameters",
    ", we are able to robustly relate all the variables @xmath40 to @xmath30 in the whole interval from 0 to @xmath108 .    at the end of the process ,",
    "the last integral is always proper , which allows a robust numerical inversion in the vicinity of @xmath28 .",
    "intuitively , this is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we appreciate the abrupt fall - off of @xmath116 .    in the comments written in section [ sec : exact ]",
    "after eqs.([eq2.8 ] ) , ( [ eq2.12 ] ) , ( [ eq2.15 ] ) , and ( [ eq2.17 ] ) regarding the nature of those integrands , we noted that in general they behave as @xmath117 .",
    "this implies that the condition @xmath118 tells us the value of @xmath119 , @xmath120 such that , for @xmath121 , the respective integral is proper and there is no need to introduce more artificial integrating parameters .",
    "the reader should note that the @xmath103 introduced in the method is not a limiting factor of precision , but merely sets the temporal ranges of the various integrating parameters @xmath102 . in our procedure ,",
    "the only source of inaccuracy is the precision of mathematica , used for the numerical inversion of the integrals .    as a final conclusion",
    "we would say that the exact numerical method presented in this paper to solve this fiber - bundle problem does not predict any new qualitative result with respect to what was obtained using the approximate method of ref .",
    "therefore , no new physical conclusions can be drawn from here .",
    "the use of this exact strategy in other scientific problems that are cast as an autonomous differential system will be considered in the next future . in this respect ,",
    "clear candidates are some ecological problems and models of infection spreading @xcite .      .",
