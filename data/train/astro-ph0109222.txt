    "the 1.54-day orbital period together with the faintness of the quiescent optical counterpart suggest that 1550 is a low - mass system",
    ". the companion star should be close to filling its roche lobe , so that the mass transfer can be rapid enough to fuel the outbursts and sustain the subsequent soft state .",

    "the quiescent brightness and the observed colour differences favor a late - type subgiant .",
    "there are two consequences of having a late - type subgiant companion in the system .",
    "firstly , if we adopt a 1.5-day orbital period , and assume that a 10-m@xmath29 black hole is powering isotropic emission of x - rays at 0.1 of the eddington luminosity , the fraction of x - ray luminosity ( @xmath30 ) intercepted by the companion star will be much greater than the intrinsic luminosity of the g / k subgiant companion ( @xmath31@xmath32 ) .",
    "irradiation by soft x - rays will cause surface evaporation and blanketing of the energy diffusing from the stellar interior .",
    "irradiation by hard x - rays will result in the deposition of energy deep in the stellar envelope ( e.g.  vilhu , ergma & fedorova 1994 ) .",
    "a cool subgiant companion is therefore susceptible to irradiative heating and consequent instabilities .    secondly , while the tidally - deformed stellar envelope can be locked in synchronous rotation with the orbit , the degenerate stellar core may not attain perfect rotational synchronism .",
    "the differential rotation leads to dynamo action and magnetic activity , similar to the situation in the rs cvn systems , which are magnetic close binaries containing a g / k subgiant .",
    "for instance , in the well - studied rs cvn system hr  1099 , with a 2.8-day orbital period , there is strong evidence ( donati et al .",
    "1992 , vogt et al .",
    "1999 ) that the k1  iv component harbours a multi - kilogauss global dipolar field .",
    "given that fast rotating isolated g / k subgiants ( schrijver & pols 1993 ) and g / k subgiants in rs cvn systems are highly magnetically active , g / k subgiants in x - ray binaries can also be magnetic . a surface field strength of 1  kg , corresponding to a magnetic stress of @xmath33  erg  @xmath28 , is strong enough to influence the mass- and energy - transport process in the stellar atmosphere . by postulating a magnetic g / k subgiant companion for 1550",
    "we are implying a new scenario in which the outburst properties are determined not only by accretion - disk instabilities , mass - transfer instabilities and irradiative heating , but also by stellar magnetism .",
    "three remarkable features of the 1998 outburst of 1550 are : ( 1 ) an impulsive rise in the hard x - rays , while the soft x - ray flux remained low at the onset of the outburst ; ( 2 ) a subsequent giant flare that occurred almost simultaneously in both hard and soft x - rays about twelve days after the initial rise of the hard x - rays ; ( 3 ) an exponential decay in the soft x - ray brightness at the end of phase 5 , with the same timescale as those seen in the 1999 and 2000 outbursts .",
    "it is generally accepted that hard x - ray emission is not thermal emission from an accretion disk ( whose maximum temperature is @xmath34 kev ) , but is produced by inverse compton scattering of softer photons off highly energetic ( @xmath35 kev ) electrons near the bh .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that accretion of matter with low angular momentum tends to produce hard x - rays ( igumenshchev , illarionov & abramowicz 1999 ; beloborodov & illarionov 2000 ; chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ) .",
    "the physical justification is that free - falling electrons in a quasi - spherical inflow can acquire kinetic energies @xmath18100 kev as they approach the bh horizon .",
    "the kinetic energy of the infalling electrons powers the comptonisation process , either directly ( bulk - motion comptonisation ) or after it has been converted into thermal energy ( thermal comptonisation ) .",
    "impulsive hard x - ray bursts can occur if the injection of material is also impulsive and with a narrow distribution of angular momenta .",
    "we therefore argue that an impulsive injection of matter with low angular momentum was responsible for the initial hard x - ray spike in the 1998 outburst , and that this initial condition could have been a consequence of a magnetic companion star .",
    "extended regions of cool , optically - thin , magnetically confined material around a k star are a common feature of rs cvn systems .",
    "the typical scale - height of these prominences above the photosphere is about twice the stellar radius , implying a volume of @xmath36@xmath37 @xmath38 for the confining region .",
    "prominences evolve over timescales of days , and contain at any given time a mass of @xmath39 g ( hall & ramsey 1994 ) .",
    "we argue that the mass of cold , magnetically - confined gas can in fact be even higher in 1550 , when the magnetic companion star is close to filling its roche lobe .",
    "the inner lagrangian ( l@xmath40 ) point is a saddle point where the gravitational force is negligible , and matter can be more easily lifted up from the photosphere of the companion star .",
    "moreover , the gas is prevented from moving in any direction other than along the axis between the stars ; at the same time , the magnetic field of the companion star restricts the flow along that axis .",
    "the gas mass builds up ( over a timescale of a few days ) until eventually the gas pressure overcomes the magnetic barrier ( see figure 2 for a cartoon picture of our model ) .    for magnetic confinement near l@xmath40",
    ", the magnetic tension / stress must be greater than the gas pressure , implying a critical density for the confined matter : @xmath41 for the sizes of the confining regions in rs cvn systems , and if we assume uniform density , this corresponds to a mass upper limit of @xmath42  g. ( if the gas accumulates near the loops apices , the total mass may be less than this value when the confinement breaks down . )",
    "this is consistent with the accreted mass that is required to explain the initial hard x - ray burst (  3 ) . by analogy with rs cvn systems , the confined gas in 1550",
    "may be located well beyond the l@xmath40 point , deep into the roche lobe of the primary , but corotating with the binary .",
    "the mass loss rate of the secondary would then determine the time necessary to fill the magnetic bags . at the start of an outburst , as the magnetic companion star is close to filling its roche lobe , part of the photospheric layers is lifted and confined in a magnetic bag beyond the l@xmath40 point ( low angular momentum component of the accretion flow ) , while another component starts to be transferred through the lagrangian point ( high angular momentum component ) .",
    "it is the low - angular momentum component that we believe is responsible for the peculiar hard x - ray spike seen in phase 1 , while the high - angular momentum component leads to the formation of the disk .",
    "as the magnetic prominence evolves , the material confined beyond the l@xmath40 point tends to collect in the loop apex , until its density increases and it eventually bursts the magnetic dam , breaking free of the field . in a frame corotating with the orbit ,",
    "the average initial angular momentum of the accreting matter with respect to the black hole is low , i.e. , it is effectively in radial free - fall . in contrast , the angular momentum of the matter accreted via conventional roche - lobe overflow is large , because the matter passing through the l@xmath40 point is transonic , and the accretion stream has a non - zero pitch angle ( see lubow & shu 1975 ) .",
    "the low angular momentum component of the flow will deviate from near - radial only when approaching the black hole . when the infalling material encounters its centrifugal barrier in the vicinity of the hole , an accretion shock may be formed , converting the kinetic energy to radiation .",
    "the photons would then be upscattered by the hot electrons , causing an outburst of hard x - rays . in an alternative scenario",
    ", the photons may be upscattered as they interact with the bulk motion of the infalling electrons . when the low - angular - momentum accreting material is depleted , the quasi - spherical inflow subsides , and the hard x - ray luminosity declines .",
    "at the same time , an accretion disk is formed at large radii by the matter transferred via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the steady building and expansion of the disk inwards via diffusion processes results in a gradual increase of the optical brightness and then of the soft x - ray luminosity , evident in phases 1 and 2 .",
    "the _ hard _ x - rays can penetrate deep into the star , and deposit energy into the convective envelope , thus disturbing the thermal equilibrium of the star .",
    "the star must readjust its structure in response to the sudden heating , and it will expand until a new equilibrium is established . at the same time , _ soft _ x - ray irradiation causes an instantaneous heating of the upper stellar atmosphere , and hence a rapid increase in the atmospheric scale height .",
    "the timescale for thermal readjustment of the stellar envelope ( up to a few weeks ) is longer than the dynamic and thermal timescales of atmospheric activity induced by soft x - ray irradiation ( vilhu et al .",
    "although both hard and soft x - ray irradiation will eventually cause an increase in the rate of mass transfer , there will be a delayed response from the companion star to the initial strong hard x - ray heating .",
    "the subsequent onset of a soft state is probably due to the subgiant regaining contact with its critical roche surface , as a result of the delayed expansion caused by the hard x - ray heating .      during phases 1 and 2 we have accretion of free - falling matter with low angular momentum at small radii , and accretion of matter with high angular momentum , via roche - lobe overflow , at large radii .",
    "the former creates a hot , pressure - supported , sub - keplerian `` disk '' or quasi - spherical region at small radii , growing outwards ; the latter creates a keplerian ring slowly diffusing inwards and outwards , forming a standard shakura - sunyaev disk .",
    "a discontinuity arises when the two accretion flows meet , and the inner boundary of the keplerian disk is subject to a strong shear .",
    "we suggest that this leads to a sudden increase in mass transfer as the outer , denser , colder gas suddenly loses part of its angular momentum at this shear discontinuity , thereby triggering the giant soft and hard x - ray flare around mjd  51076 ( phase 3 ) .",
    "the initial hard x - ray burst in phase 1 and the giant flare in phase 3 have different soft x - ray properties .",
    "moreover , the latter was accompanied by strong radio activity . because of",
    "insufficient shear , the quasi - spherical accretion flow in phase 1 is unlikely to amplify the seed magnetic field carried by the infalling matter significantly .",
    "only after an accretion disk is formed will dynamo action become efficient and amplify the field .",
    "one possibility is that when the magnetic disk joins the sub - keplerian inner region , and mass accretion suddenly increases ( giant flare ) , the magnetic field is dragged rapidly towards the black - hole event horizon by the accreting matter . the field would be compressed and might reconnect , causing the expulsion of disk material and hence the formation of a radio flare / jet . the small increase in optical brightness during the giant x - ray flare",
    "is surprising .",
    "however , the heating of the companion star and of the accretion disk could have saturated due to strong x - ray irradiation during the previous phases , and the accretion disk may already have been extended to its outer tidal limit .      around mjd  51110 , both the hard and soft x - ray luminosity began to decline exponentially , with the soft x - rays lagging the hard .",
    "the e - folding decay timescale is @xmath43  d for _ rxte_/asm and slightly shorter for batse .",
    "the corresponding decay timescales for the later outbursts in 1998/1999 and 2000 are almost identical : @xmath44 and @xmath45  d respectively ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the decline in the x - ray luminosity is therefore evidence of the drainage of the accretion disk .",
    "the timescale on which a disk is emptied is @xmath46^{2/3}\\ ] ] ( pringle 1981 ) , where @xmath47 is the gravitational constant , @xmath48 the orbital period , @xmath49 the black - hole mass , @xmath50 the mass ratio , @xmath51 the disk radius , and @xmath52 the effective viscosity .",
    "a decay timescale of 11 days implies @xmath53 if @xmath54 , @xmath55  m@xmath29 . the effective viscosity is often expressed in terms of a constant parameter @xmath56 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) : @xmath57 where the sound speed @xmath58 , and the keplerian angular velocity @xmath59 ( @xmath60m@xmath29)@xmath61 ( @xmath62 cm)@xmath63 s@xmath5 . for temperatures",
    "@xmath64 @xmath8  @xmath65 @xmath8  @xmath66 k , typical of the outer regions of the disk ( @xmath67 ) , the observed timescale corresponds to an effective @xmath68 at large radii .",
    "a remarkable characteristic of the outburst behaviour of 1550 is the presence of a sharp hard x - ray spike during the initial rise .",
    "this spectral behaviour is different to that observed in systems such as gro  j1655@xmath040 , gs  1354@xmath064 or gx  339@xmath04 .",
    "the 1996 outburst of gro  j1655@xmath040 started with a very soft state ( hynes et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the hard x - rays turned on about a month after the start of the outburst . in gs 1354@xmath064 ,",

    "2001 ) . in gx 339@xmath04 ,",
    "the soft and hard fluxes tend to be anticorrelated ( corbel et al . 2000 ) .",
    "no initial hard x - ray spike is detected in any of those three systems .",
    "in fact , 1550 is not the only system showing a hard x - ray spike at the onset of an outburst .",
    "xte j1859@xmath69226 ( wood et al . 1999 ; mccollough & wilson 1999 ; brocksopp et al .",

    "the hard x - ray flux reached a maximum within the first day after detection , and then declined after about 4 days .",

    "the similarity in the x - ray spectral properties of 1550 , xte j1859@xmath69226 and xte j2012@xmath69381 can be seen from their hardness - ratios plots ( figure 4 ; data from the public _ rxte_/asm archive ) .",
    "these systems probably belong to a subclass of bh transients , sharing a similar physical mechanism that gives rise to a strong hard x - ray spike at the onset of an outburst .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the hard x - ray properties of this type of systems will be presented elsewhere ( soria et al 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "we propose that the difference between the outburst behaviour of systems like 1550 and of the other bh transients is due to the difference in the relative angular momentum content of their accreting matter .",
    "matter accreted via a stellar wind has a lower specific angular momentum than matter accreted via roche - lobe overflow , and it has been suggested that the wind - fed systems and systems with roche - lobe overflow have different preferential spectral states ( beloborodov & illarionov 2001 ; wu et al .",
    "there is also evidence that the accretion flow in bh x - ray binaries consists of separate components , each with a different distribution of angular momentum .",
    "observations of 1e  1740@xmath0294 , grs  1758@xmath0258 and gx  339@xmath04 ( smith , heindl & swank 2001 ) indicate that the delay of the soft component relative to the hard component ( approximately equal to the difference between the viscous and the free - fall timescale ) is more evident for systems with roche - lobe overflow , i.e.  those where a large accretion disk is present , and the high angular momentum component dominates .",
    "shorter viscous delays were observed for wind - fed systems ( e.g. ,  cyg x-1 in the hard state ; smith et al .",
    "2001 ) where the low - angular momentum component dominates .",
    "we attribute the presence of the hard x - ray spike in 1550 to an inflow of accreting matter with low angular momentum , lasting over the first few days .",
    "the 3200 kev x - ray spectrum of 1550 at the peak of the initial hard phase ( wilson & done 2001 ) is in fact very similar to the spectrum of cyg x-1 in its hard state , consistent with the intepretation that the initial accretion flow in 1550 was dominated by the low angular - momentum component .",
    "the hard and soft states of bhc outbursts are usually explained by models invoking an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk which is initially truncated in the inner region .",
    "the optical / ir flux comes mostly from the outer disk region .",
    "the soft x - ray flux rises on a viscous timescale as the disk grows inwards at the beginning of the outburst , and is therefore delayed with respect to the optical flux . at small radii",
    ", the accretion flow is hot and quasi - spherical .",
    "the hard x - rays are due to inverse - compton scattering of soft photons from the disk or the companion star by highly energetic electrons in the hot quasi - spherical flow near the bh .",
    "when the quasi - spherical flow subsides and is replaced by the thin accretion disk extending down towards the innermost stable circular orbit of the bh , the system is observed in a high / soft state .    in our model , the outburst behaviour",
    "is determined by the mass - transfer rate ( which determines the energetics of the burst ) and the angular momentum distribution of the accreting matter ( which determines the initial spectral properties and the x - ray rise time ) .",
    "the inner , quasi - spherical flow is fed by the accretion of material with low angular momentum , while the disk is formed by accretion of high angular momentum matter transferred via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the initial hard x - ray emission is caused by a sudden injection of accreting matter with low angular momentum .",
    "when the injection ends and the supply of low - angular momentum accreting matter is depleted , the hard x - ray flux declines . in the case of 1550 ,",
    "we attribute the decline of the low angular momentum accretion flow to the emptying of the magnetic reservoir .",
    "after the magnetic bags are drained , accretion proceeds only via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "our model is in contrast to scenarios based on advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf models ; see narayan & yi 1995 ; esin et al .",
    "1997 ) , in which spectral softening is attributed to the collapse of the hot , quasi - spherical flow into an optically thick disk when the mass accretion rate increases .",
    "an application of the adaf model to the 1998 outburst of 1550 has been presented by wilson & done ( 2001 ) .",
    "the conventional adaf scenarios do not explain why in some systems ( such as 1550 ) the hot inner region produces a strong hard x - ray spike before collapsing , while in other systems ( such as gro  j1655@xmath040 ) no such initial spike is observed .",
    "moreover , the observed duration of the initial hard emission seems to be much longer than the timescale for the collapse of the hot flow in the conventional adaf model ( wilson & done 2001 ) .",
    "we describe the morphology of the 1998 outburst of 1550 , dividing it into five phases .",
    "the outburst starts with a hard x - ray flare ( peaking after @xmath34 d ) ; the same behaviour is observed in at least two other bhcs .",
    "we propose that the companion star in 1550 is magnetically active , and its magnetic field creates a magnetic bag capable of confining @xmath42 g of gas inside the roche lobe of the primary , corotating with the binary .",
    "the impulsive rise in the hard x - rays is explained by the inflow of material with low angular momentum onto the black hole , on a free - fall timescale , when the magnetic confinement breaks down . at the same time ,",
    "matter with higher angular momentum , transferred via roche - lobe overflow , begins to form a keplerian disk , responsible for the soft x - rays and optical emission .",
    "we suggest that the onset of the outburst is determined by an increased mass transfer rate from the companion star , but the outburst morphology is determined by the distribution of specific angular momentum in the accreting matter .",
    "when the inner boundary of the outer , denser keplerian disk comes into contact with the inner sub - keplerian hot region , the disk matter is subject to a strong shear and loses angular momentum .",
    "this disturbs the stability of the accretion disk , causes a sudden increase in the mass accretion rate , and is responsible for the observed giant x - ray flare and radio ejections .",
    "an identical timescale of 11 days is found for the decay of the soft x - ray flux in the three outbursts observed in this system , implying an effective viscosity @xmath53 for the accretion disk .",
    "we thank celia sanchez - fernandez and raj jain for allowing us to use their optical data , and colin wilson for providing helpful information on his x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for providing useful suggestions on how to improve our paper .",
