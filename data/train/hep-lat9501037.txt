    "simulations of lattice qcd at non - zero chemical potential @xmath0 have remained in a quagmire for over a decade  @xcite .",
    "the lattice action becomes complex when @xmath0 is taken non - zero , so conventional computer simulation algorithms which are based on a probability distribution do not apply .",
    "the quenched version of lattice qcd , which attempts to skirt the issue by replacing the complex fermion determinant by unity , appears to be pathological in the chiral limit  @xcite@xcite .",
    "when the bare quark mass is non - zero so the pion is not massless , one finds that quenched simulations of lattice qcd work for @xmath0 outside a  forbidden \" region extending from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denote pion and baryon masses respectively  @xcite .",
    "the failure of the quenched version of qcd to describe the forbidden region is poorly understood  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "studies of zero dimensional models of non - zero chemical potential have not been decisive  some models work in their quenched versions @xcite and others do not  @xcite .",
    "since such models can not respect the goldstone mechanism , their relevance to qcd is questionable at best .    in this paper",
    ", we study the @xmath6-flavor four - fermi model with u(1 ) chiral symmetry , sometimes called the gross - neveu model  @xcite , in three dimensions ( ie . two space and one time ) as a function of chemical potential @xmath0 .",
    "the action is @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 are four component spinors and a sum on @xmath9 is understood . for @xmath10",
    "this model has a massless pion in the chiral limit @xmath11 @xcite and can be studied by the leading order @xmath1 expansion @xcite@xcite as well as by conventional computer simulations .",
    "since the pathologies in qcd simulations are tied to @xmath12 , we can address the possibility that the presence of this massless mode is the culprit in past failures .",
    "in addition , the model has composite mesons like qcd and has sensible infra - red and ultra - violet properties .",
    "the zero chemical potential model has a chiral transition as a function of its bare coupling which can be analyzed using the @xmath1 expansion  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the second order phase transition coincides with a renormalization group fixed point and defines an interacting continuum field theory  @xcite @xcite .",
    "it will prove interesting to simulate the u(1 ) four - fermi model to see the physics of chiral symmetry restoration at work in a model with a realistic , composite pion .",
    "the four - fermi model lacks two central features of qcd : 1 .",
    "the model does not confine , and 2 .",
    "its fermion determinant is real and non - negative even when @xmath13 .",
    "we shall see that the simulation study of the four - fermi model is completely successful and physical , and in agreement with the predictions of the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "in addition to the usual thermodynamic quantities such as the chiral condensate @xmath14 , the fermion energy density @xmath15 , and the fermion density @xmath16 itself , we will measure some spectroscopic features of the model .",
    "these will include the pion and fermion screening lengths , since they are so closely tied to the physics issues of interest .",
    "recall how chemical potentials are implemented and screening lengths are measured .",
    "consider a symmetric @xmath17 lattice and label one of the axes @xmath18 ,  temporal . \" in the @xmath19 direction assign a factor exp(@xmath0 ) to each such link in the action , and in the @xmath20 direction assign a factor exp(@xmath21 ) .",
    "these exponential factors favor quark propagation in the @xmath19 direction and when @xmath0 is small in units of the reciprocal lattice spacing , ie .",
    "@xmath22 , we have a useful , well - behaved transcription of the chemical potential to a discretized system  @xcite@xcite .",
    "screening lengths are calculated in this environment by calculating propagation with a source at @xmath23 and a sink at @xmath24 . the exponential fall - off with @xmath18",
    "then gives an estimate of the appropriate screening length , as will be illustrated through detailed calculations in the text below .",
    "the simplest expectation is that the pion inverse screening length should be zero in the chiral limit for small @xmath0 where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , and as @xmath0 increases through a critical value @xmath2 , where chiral symmetry is restored , the pion inverse screening length should increase from zero non - analytically .",
    "the fermion inverse screening length should decrease linearly with @xmath0 and vanish at @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the value of the fermion mass at @xmath27 .",
    "interactions are expected to decrease @xmath2 below this free field result , but at large @xmath6 the naive result should be accurate .",
    "the result @xmath25 assumes that the fundamental fermion is the lightest fermion in the model s mass spectrum .",
    "although this result is expected in three dimensions , it is not true in four - fermi models in two dimensions , where there are  kink \" solutions and kink  anti - kink bound states  @xcite .",
    "computer simulation of the two dimensional model were successful in finding the kink solutions and the subtle theoretical predictions were confirmed  @xcite . in this study",
    "we shall confirm the naive expectation @xmath25 with good control .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0-dependence of the fermion screening length will be consistent with , @xmath28 which is also the free - field prediction .",
    "the results of our @xmath1 calculation and lattice simulations were very clear .",
    "the simulation gave the expected physical answers for both large @xmath6 ( @xmath29 ) , and intermediate @xmath6 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we worked near the chiral limit and found no pathologies when @xmath0 passed through the value @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the algorithm was well - behaved for all @xmath0 and computer simulations in the immediate vicinity of @xmath31 were only limited by finite size effects of the expected variety .",
    "the chiral symmetry restoring transition was clear in all the observables calculated and excellent consistency was found between the various measurements .",
    "does this success help us understand the confused state of qcd simulations at non - zero chemical potentials ?",
    "it certainly indicates that a massless pion is _ not _ the culprit behind the failures encountered in qcd simulations .",
    "the compositeness of the pion is also seen to be harmless . as suggested by many authors in the past @xcite",
    ", the complex nature of the qcd fermion determinant must be the source of the problem .",
    "the quenched version of qcd ignores the complex part and possible rapid variation in the determinant and is probably pathological because of this , as illustrated in the single - site u(1 ) model of gibbs  @xcite .",
    "a successful simulation of qcd at non - zero @xmath0 may require a wholly new algorithmic approach .",
    "the present generation of fermion algorithms calculate the fermion propagator in a given gauge field background , and this intermediate step may not yield useful results in qcd for @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define the lattice version of the u(1 ) four - fermi model and present some leading order large-@xmath6 results for the first order chiral symmetry restoring transition for @xmath33 in the model , which will be compared to computer simulations later in the paper . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the computer simulations of the @xmath34 and 4 models .",
    "we shall find that the usual bulk thermodynamic observables such as @xmath14 , energy densities and number densities successfully expose the chiral transition .",
    "in addition , spectroscopic measurements are equally clear and particularly informative .",
    "the pion inverse screening length is essentially zero in the broken , low @xmath0 phase , but is non - zero in the unbroken phase .",

    "the auxiliary fields only appear to quadratic order , and can be integrated out to recover a lattice action in terms of fermion fields only ( bosonization is also possible for the continuum lagrangian ( 1.1 ) ) .",

    "the interaction part of the action can be rewritten as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 denote the sum of the eight scalar fields associated with the site @xmath66 on the blocked lattice ( see @xcite for full details ) , and @xmath67 is the lattice spacing , which has been set to unity in eqns .",

    "note that the kinetic part of @xmath82 , @xmath44 , is strictly real even for @xmath83 , and that the complex part @xmath84 is diagonal .",
    "thus , schematically , @xmath85 since each matrix @xmath44 effectively describes @xmath62 fermion species , we conclude that the hybrid monte carlo simulation describes a system of @xmath6 fermion species , @xmath62 having positive chiral charge and @xmath62 negative . to be more precise , the full symmetry of the lattice model in the continuum limit is @xmath86 rather than the @xmath87 we would obtain if all species transformed identically with respect to chiral rotations . at non - zero lattice spacing , of course , the symmetry group is smaller as discussed above : @xmath88 . in all cases , of course , it is the @xmath89 symmetry which is broken , either spontaneously by the dynamics of the system , or explicitly by a bare fermion mass .",
    "it was found that the performance of the hybrid monte carlo procedure could be optimized in two ways : firstly , as described in @xcite@xcite , by tuning the effective number of fermion species @xmath90 used in the guidance part of the program ( ie . during the integration of the equations of motion along a microcanonical trajectory ) to maximize the acceptance rate of the monte carlo procedure for fixed timestep @xmath91 ; and secondly by choosing the trajectory length @xmath18 at random from a poisson distribution of mean @xmath92 .",

    "we found that the choice @xmath93 was adequate ",
    "the acceptance rate in the monte carlo procedure was always high ( better than 80% ) while the algorithm sampled configuration space with good speed and efficiency . for the @xmath94 model the acceptance rate was improved by taking @xmath95 slightly larger , typically 4.05 , although the  best \" choice of @xmath96 certainly depends on lattice sizes ( @xmath97 in our case ) and couplings ( @xmath98 and bare fermion masses ( 0.01 in lattice units ) .",

    "a larger @xmath99 probably would have been better , but we had no trouble obtaining good data with modest error bars from runs of several hundred trajectories .",
    "the data and error bars will be presented in tables in the next section .",

    "demonstrate that these bare masses do not distort the first order symmetry restoring transition significantly .",
    "since the mass ratios @xmath129 are 0.012 and 0.058 , approximately , in the two cases and since the transition is strongly first order , this result is expected . in fig .",

    "a recent study of quenched qcd @xcite showed that in the limited range @xmath186 , the baryon mass as defined through the exponential falloff of a euclidean propagator as in eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) decreased linearly with @xmath0 and would vanish by linear extrapolation at @xmath187 as expected .",
    "unfortunately , the quenched simulation algorithm suffers from slow convergence and large fluctuations for @xmath188 , so nothing is known quantitatively in the  forbidden \" region , @xmath189 in addition , the quenched qcd simulation showed that the pion mass , as defined through the exponential fall - off of a propagator as in eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) , is insensitive to @xmath0 for @xmath190 .",
    "this is another sensible result which could not be confirmed at larger @xmath0 due to the pathologies of the quenched simulation . in our four - fermi model",
    "the analogous calculations are successful for all @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "11 we show the fermion mass as obtained from eq .",
    "up to modest and expected finite size effects which reduce the fermion mass estimates in the vicinity of @xmath2 , the calculation is successful , and gives a critical chemical potential near 0.74(2 ) , although larger lattice studies and a systematic analysis of finite size effects would be necessary to obtain a quantitative prediction . also in fig .",
    "11 we show the pion mass @xmath12 , calculated using eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the pion mass exhibits no @xmath0 dependence until we reach the vicinity of @xmath185 where it jumps up indicating chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "we wanted to measure the @xmath39 mass over the same range , but its propagator was noisier than the pions and quantitative estimates were not achieved . we had hoped to verify that the pion and the sigma are degenerate and heavy for @xmath191 , indicating chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "although from this perspective our calculations were only partially successful , they gave decisive physical answers expected of a goldstone particle as we pass through a chiral symmetry restoring transition .",
    "next we repeated these measurements at @xmath192 in the @xmath193 model in order to be closer to the model s continuum limit . at @xmath192",
    "the @xmath160 value of the fermion mass is @xmath194 . on the basis of the analytic large-@xmath6 results shown in figs .",
    "3,4 and 5 , we anticipate that the transition will be harder to identify since finite size effects are more severe and smooth the transition considerably on a @xmath97 lattice .",
    "we show the data for @xmath192 in table iii . it is organized just as table ii was . in figs .",
    "12 - 14 we show @xmath195 and @xmath159 plotted vs. @xmath0 .",
    "these figures show the same features as the large-@xmath6 calculation , and indicate that the transition is in the vicinity of @xmath196 .",
    "there is no evidence whatsoever for pathological behavior at @xmath197 .",
    "the transition is shown with greater clarity in the model s spectroscopy . in fig .",
    "15 we see that the dynamical fermion mass decreases , up to the expected finite size effects , linearly with @xmath0 and vanishes when @xmath0 becomes 0.25(5 ) .",
    "similarly , the pion mass is insensitive to @xmath0 until @xmath198 , where it increases noticeably .",
    "we learn that the model s spectroscopy is a more sensitive guide to the chiral restoration transition than traditional bulk thermodynamic quantities . in light of our recent work on",
    "quenched qcd  @xcite , this result comes as no surprise , but it reinforces the strategy we are taking in the four dimensional gauge model .",
    "next we turn to the @xmath139 model to simulate a case where fluctuations are expected to be more significant , the number of flavors is more realistic and the large-@xmath6 expansion may not be as good a guide .",
    "the @xmath160 data is collected in table iv .",
    "we notice , as plotted in fig .",
    "16 , that the order parameter @xmath39 and dynamical fermion mass @xmath26 disagree slightly deep in the broken symmetry phase , but are otherwise in good agreement .",
    "since these two quantities are identical at large-@xmath6 , we see signs of @xmath1 corrections here , but they are not numerically significant near the transition .",
    "we will investigate the theory at non - zero @xmath0 at both @xmath199 and 0.70 .",
    "the @xmath200 simulation is quite far in the broken phase and should be relatively decisive while the @xmath201 simulation will be more strongly affected by fluctuations . in figs .",
    "17 - 19 we show @xmath202 and @xmath159 plotted against @xmath0 using the data of table v. in this case the plots show only qualitative agreement with the predictions of the @xmath1 expansion at leading order ; @xmath173 corrections are numerically much more significant .",
    "we expect a transition near the value of the dynamical fermion mass at @xmath203 , ie , @xmath204 , and the figures are in fine agreement with that .",
    "in addition the fermion and pion masses , fig .",
    "20 , show the transition almost as clearly and quantitatively as they did in the @xmath138 , @xmath164 case . finally in table vi and figs .",
    "21 - 24 we show the analogous quantities for the @xmath139 theory at @xmath201 .",
    "although the bulk thermodynamic quantities experience considerable rounding , the results are consistent with a critical chemical potential @xmath205 , as predicted by the value of the dynamical fermion mass at @xmath201 . once again , the spectroscopic quantities in fig . 24 provide more quantitative information .",
    "all in all , the simulations are successful in each case and do not suffer from the pathologies affecting quenched qcd .",
    "the success and clarity of these simulations shows that the hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( and hence presumably the closely related hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm , suitable for values of @xmath6 which are not a multiple of 4 ) are completely reliable for this class of fermion field theories in which there is a massless pion in the chiral limit .",
    "a chiral symmetry restoring phase transition , probably first order , is found for a critical value of the chemical potential @xmath0 .",
    "screening length calculations proved to be particularly illuminating and the expected physics of chiral symmetry restoration at the critical chemical potential emerged .",
    "the spectroscopic data may well prove to be the most accurate means of determining the critical chemical potential on finite systems .",
    "the predictions of the large @xmath6 expansion proved to be a good guide into the physics of these four fermi models even when @xmath6 assumed modest values .",
    "systematic effects are of the expected form , and we have no reason to suspect they could not be brought under complete control given sufficient computer time .",
    "one of our primary motivations for this work was to narrow down the source of difficulties in simulations of lattice qcd .",
    "we certainly have demonstrated that the presence of a massless pion in the theory s spectrum is _ not _ the source of those difficulties . by default",
    "it must be the complex nature of the qcd action at nonzero @xmath0 that is the culprit .",
    "the quenched version of qcd ignores the fermion determinant and this omission apparently amounts to a qualitative error when the chemical potential is larger than half the pion mass @xcite . in four fermi models",
    "the fermion determinant is real and non - negative and the euclidean theory has a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "in addition , the fermion propagator is well - behaved for all @xmath0 .",
    "these ingredients then allow the hybrid algorithms to be successful in four fermi models despite being inapplicable for qcd .",
    "it may well be that langevin algorithms @xcite can simulate qcd directly at nonzero @xmath0 , but that is far from clear at this time ( langevin algorithms are known to correctly evaluate certain complex integrals , and certain physical systems with complex actions , but their successes and failures are difficult to anticipate in advance ) .",
    "it will probably require greater insight into the numerics of the complex fermion determinant before a truly trustworthy , first principles simulation of qcd in an environment rich in baryons is possible .",
