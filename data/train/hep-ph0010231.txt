    "the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) is a discrepancy between the measured values of the solar neutrino flux at different energies @xcite and the corresponding predictions of the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite .",
    "not only is the observed flux suppressed , compared to the ssm predictions , but , if the data from the homestake experiment are correct , the degree of suppression varies with energy .",
    "the leading explanation of this phenomenon is that neutrinos have small masses and the mass and flavor bases in the lepton sector are not aligned , just like in the quark sector .",
    "the resulting neutrino oscillations convert some of the solar electron neutrinos into another neutrino species .",
    "neutrino oscillation solutions to the snp have traditionally been divided into the so - called mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solutions @xcite and the vacuum oscillation ( vo ) solutions , according to the physical mechanism responsible for the neutrino flavor conversion in each case . in the msw case",
    "the conversion is caused by neutrino interactions with the solar ( and earth s ) matter , while in the vo case it is due to long - wavelength neutrino oscillations in vacuum between the sun and the earth . over time",
    ", it has become a tradition to treat the two cases completely separately , showing results in separate plots ( see , for example , @xcite ) and using different input formulas and different codes .",
    "justifying such a complete separation , however , requires a careful analysis of the magnitude of the solar matter effects and the degree of decoherence of vacuum oscillations .",
    "the separation assumption has been recently reexamined by the author @xcite and it has been found that the solar matter effects are nonnegligible for the vacuum oscillation solutions with @xmath6 ev@xmath7 .",
    "this conclusion has been subsequently verified by other authors @xcite , and the term _ quasi - vacuum oscillations _ ( qvo ) has been coined to refer to the region where both effects influence the neutrino survival probability @xcite .",
    "it must be mentioned that the experimental situation has changed since the qvo solutions were first introduced . at the time , the most preferred part of the vo solutions was in the region @xmath8 ev@xmath7 .",
    "the latest super - kamiokande spectrum data , however , disfavors a large fraction of the vacuum oscillation region , roughly @xmath9 ev@xmath7 @xmath10 ev@xmath7 @xcite . at the same time , the solutions with @xmath11 ev@xmath7 , _",
    "i. e. _ the qvo solutions , remain allowed .    prior to @xcite",
    ", the vo solutions had always been studied in the range of the neutrino mixing angle @xmath12 for a fixed sign of @xmath3 .",
    "when matter effects are included , however , this only covers a half of the full parameter space . to cover the full space , one",
    "can either ( i ) keep @xmath1 in the range @xmath12 and consider both signs of @xmath3 , or ( ii ) fix the sign of @xmath3 and vary @xmath1 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "we advocate the second option as a better _ physical _ choice , because it makes manifest the continuity of physics around the maximal mixing @xcite .",
    "the parametrization @xmath15 requires one to reexamine the choice of a variable for plots , because the traditional variable @xmath16 is not suitable for this purpose @xcite .",
    "while either @xmath1 or @xmath17 would be adequate for plotting only the qvo region , neither choice allows one to take a global view of the neutrino parameter space and show all solutions , including the sma and ( quasi)vacuum oscillation solutions , on the same plot @xcite .",
    "a particularly convenient choice turns out to be @xmath18 on the logarithmic scale , first used in @xcite to describe 3-family msw oscillations .",
    "in addition to covering the range @xmath15 , it also does not introduce any unphysical singularity around @xmath19 ( unlike the traditional @xmath16 , see @xcite ) and makes it easy to see where in the vacuum oscillation region the evolution in the sun becomes completely nonadiabatic ( points @xmath1 and @xmath20 become equivalent , so that solutions become symmetric with respect to the @xmath19 line ) .    in the first part of this paper we address several conceptual questions that arise in the analysis of the solar matter effects and",
    "become particularly apparent for the values of the mixing angle @xmath21 . to introduce these questions , it is useful to first summarize the basic mechanism of the neutrino evolution in the sun . inside the sun , because of the changing electron density , the eigenstates of the instantaneous hamiltonian change along the neutrino trajectory . for @xmath22 ev@xmath7/mev",
    "the neutrino is produced almost completely in the heavy eigenstate .",
    "if the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath1 are such that the neutrino remains in the heavy eigenstate as it travels to the solar surface ( _ adiabatic _ evolution ) , there are no subsequent vacuum oscillations .",
    "to oscillate in vacuum , as a necessary condition , the neutrino must at some radius in the sun `` jump '' into the superposition of the heavy ( @xmath24 ) and light ( @xmath25 ) mass eigenstates .",
    "conventional vo regime is realized when this `` jumping '' is _ extremely nonadiabatic _ ( preserving flavor ) , in which case the neutrino exits the sun as @xmath26 . in the qvo regime",
    "the neutrino still partially jumps in the @xmath25 eigenstate , but with a smaller amplitude .",
    "the obvious questions one would like to answer are :    * what physical criteria determine whether the neutrino evolution is adiabatic or not ?",
    "* at what radius in the sun does the nonadiabatic `` jumping '' between the eigenstates of the instantaneous hamiltonian take place ?",
    "the traditional wisdom is that one should analyze the density profile around the so - called resonance point , _ i.e. _ , the point where the difference of the eigenvalues of the instantaneous hamiltonian is minimal and the local value of the mixing angle is @xmath27 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "this , however , clearly needs to be modified for large mixing angles .",
    "in particular , for @xmath2 the resonance , defined in this way , simply does not exist .",
    "we will show how this contradiction is resolved in section [ sect : resonance ] . in section [",
    "sect : adiabaticity ] we formulate the adiabaticity condition that , unlike the standard result , remains valid for @xmath28 .",
    "in section [ sect : numerical ] we present the results of numerical calculations of the jumping probability @xmath29 for the neutrino propagating in the realistic solar profile .",
    "the calculations are carried out for a wide range of @xmath3 and @xmath18 , from the vo region to the region where the exponential density approximation is valid .",
    "we show how the adiabaticity prescription of section [ sect : adiabaticity ] applies to this case .",
    "we also give a simple empirical prescription on how to compute @xmath29 in this range of the parameters in terms of only elementary functions .",
    "such an empirical parametrization of the numerical results can be helpful if one would like to be able to quickly estimate the value of @xmath29 anywhere in the range in question without having to solve the differential equation each time .",
    "in section [ sect : qvo ] , we discuss what happens in the transitional region between the adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes ( qvo ) . in particular , we determine what part of the solar electron density profile is primarily responsible for the matter effects in this region .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : onesolution ] we comment on the four known exact analytical solutions for the neutrino jumping probability @xmath29 .",
    "such solutions have been found for the linear , exponential , @xmath30 , and the hyperbolic tangent matter density profiles .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether these profiles have something in common that makes finding exact solutions possible . using the formulation of the evolution equations introduced in section [ sect : noresonance ] , we show that all four results are not independent and that , given the formula for the hyperbolic tangent profile , one can very simply obtain the other three solutions .",
    "as an added benefit , we obtain an exact expression for the density distribution @xmath5 .",
    "for completeness , we begin by summarizing the well - known basic formalism for neutrino oscillations in matter . in the simplest case , when the mixing is between @xmath31 and another active neutrino species , the evolution of the neutrino state is determined by four parameters : the mass - squared splitting between the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath32 , the neutrino mixing angle @xmath1 , the neutrino energy @xmath33 , and the electron number density @xmath34 of the medium .",
    "one has to solve the schrdinger equation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the state vector made up of the electron neutrino and the muon neutrino .",
    "here denotes a linear combination of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in which @xmath39 oscillates . ]",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath40 is given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the constant in the hamiltonian is irrelevant for the study of oscillations and will be omitted from now on .",
    "the time variable @xmath44 may be replaced by the distance traveled @xmath45 , since the solar neutrinos are ultrarelativistic .    for a constant electron number density @xmath34",
    "the hamiltonian can be trivially diagonalized , @xmath46 , where @xmath47    in terms of @xmath48 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : basich ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mixing angle _ in matter_. the rotation matrix @xmath51 is given by @xmath52    the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath50 are related to the original parameters in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : basich ] ) as follows @xmath53    we will always label the light mass eigenstate by @xmath25 and the heavy one by @xmath24 . since one can redefine the phases of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , it is easy to see that in this convention the physical range of the mixing angle is @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath57 is constant , the time evolution of the mass eigenstates is particularly simple .",
    "each of the two mass eigenstates evolves only by a phase : @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "if at time @xmath60 the neutrino state is a linear combination @xmath61 , the absolute values of the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 do not change with time , _",
    "i.e. _ , the probability for the neutrino to `` jump '' from one hamiltonian eigenstate to another , @xmath64 , is trivially zero .",
    "consider next the case of a varying electron density . in this case , in general , one can no longer diagonalize the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basich ] ) .",
    "however , one can still speak of the eigenstates of the instantaneous hamiltonian ( henceforth , `` the matter mass eigenstates '' ) , and define the jumping probability between those states .",
    "it turns out that if the electron density changes sufficiently slowly along the neutrino trajectory ( to be quantified later ) , the jumping probability vanishes , just like in the constant density case .",
    "this is known as the _ adiabatic _ evolution .",
    "at the same time , when the density changes abruptly , the jumping probability is clearly nonzero .",
    "in particular , if the neutrino crosses a step  function density discontinuity , the flavor state does not have any time to evolve , while the mass basis in matter instantaneously rotates .",
    "it is easy to see that in this situation , known as the _ extreme nonadiabatic _ evolution , the jumping probability is given by @xmath65 in general , for a monotonically varying density @xmath29 lies between 0 and @xmath66",
    ".        in this paper we are concerned with the evolution of solar neutrinos .",
    "the electron number density inside the sun , @xmath34 , falls off as a function of the distance from the center @xmath67 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prfl ] @xcite . in the range @xmath68 the profile can be approximated very well by an exponential @xmath69 , with @xmath70 km ( shown by a straight line in the figure ) .",
    "however , in the convective zone of the sun and also in the core where the neutrinos are produced the profile deviates rather significantly from exponential .    in order to study the jumping probability between the matter mass eigenstates",
    "it is convenient to change to the basis these states define . substituting in the schrdinger equation @xmath71 , @xmath72",
    ", we get @xmath73 since @xmath74 and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) @xmath75 we obtain the desired evolution equation in the basis of the matter mass eigenstates @xcite @xmath76    the steps outlined so far are standard in the treatment of the msw effect",
    ". we will next make an extra step that will prove very helpful for the subsequent analysis , particularly in section [ sect : onesolution ] .",
    "namely , we will choose @xmath50 instead of @xmath45 as an independent variable .",
    "so long as the density varies monotonically , such a change is one - to - one .",

    "<S> we reexamine the conventional physical description of the neutrino evolution inside the sun . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the traditional resonance condition has physical meaning only in the limit of small values of the neutrino mixing angle , @xmath0 . for large values of @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , the resonance condition specifies neither the point of the maximal violation of adiabaticity in the nonadiabatic case , nor the point where the flavor conversion occurs at the maximal rate in the adiabatic case . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding correct conditions , valid for all values of @xmath1 including @xmath2 , are presented . </S>",
    "<S> an adiabaticity condition valid for all values of @xmath1 is also described . </S>",
    "<S> the results of accurate numerical computations of the level jumping probability in the sun are presented . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations cover a wide range of @xmath3 , from the vacuum oscillation region to the region where the standard exponential approximation is good . </S>",
    "<S> a convenient empirical parametrization of these results in terms of elementary functions is given . </S>",
    "<S> the matter effects in the so - called `` quasi - vacuum oscillation regime '' are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is shown how the known analytical results for the exponential , @xmath4 , and linear matter distributions can be simply obtained from the formula for the hyperbolic tangent profile . an explicit formula for the jumping probability for the distribution @xmath5 </S>",
