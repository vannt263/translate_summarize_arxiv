    "the kloe detector setup consists of a large drift chamber ( radius from 0.25 to 2.0  m and 3.3  m length ) surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "both are immersed in 0.52  t axial field of superconducting solenoid  @xcite . from 2000 to 2006 the kloe experiment has collected 2.5  fb@xmath2 at the peak of the @xmath1 meson resonance at the @xmath7 collider da@xmath0ne in frascati plus additional 250  pb@xmath2 of off - peak data .",
    "a new beam crossing scheme is operating at da@xmath0ne allowing to reduce beam size and increase luminosity ( to reach a peak of about 5@xmath8@xmath9s@xmath2 , a factor of 3 larger than the previously obtained ) . at the moment ,",
    "the detector is being upgraded with small angle tagging devices , to detect both low ( low energy tagger - let ) and high ( high energy tagger - het ) energy @xmath7 originated from @xmath10 reactions .",
    "it is planned to collect around 5  fb@xmath2 within one year with this setup .    in a subsequent step a light - material inner tracker ( it )",
    "will be installed in the region between the beam pipe and the drift chamber to improve charged vertex reconstruction and to increase the acceptance for low transversal momentum tracks  @xcite .",
    "crystal calorimeters ( ccalt ) will cover the low @xmath11 region to increase acceptance for very forward electrons and photons down to 8@xmath12 .",
    "a new tile calorimeter ( qcalt ) will be used for the detection of photons coming from @xmath13 decays in the drift chamber .",
    "implementation of the second step is planned for late 2011 .",
    "further modifications of the da@xmath0ne collider , presently under discussion , would allow energies up to 2.5  gev ( @xmath14 ) to be reached without loss of luminosity .",
    "since the kloe2 detector is perfectly suited for data taking also at energies away from the @xmath1 meson mass , a proposal to perform precision measurements of ( multi)hadronic and @xmath15 cross sections has also been put forward  @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of the kloe2 physics program can be found in ref .",
    "the term @xmath15 _ physics _ ( or _ two photon physics _ ) stands for the study of the reaction : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an arbitrary hadronic state with quantum numbers @xmath18 and the two photons tend to be quasi - real  @xcite .",
    "if no cut is applied to the final - state leptons , the weizscker - williams approximation  @xcite can be used to understand the main qualitative features of process ( [ eq : gg - stat1 ] ) . then the event yield , @xmath19 ,",
    "can be evaluated according to : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the invariant mass of the two quasi ",
    "real photons , @xmath22 is the integrated luminosity , and @xmath23 is the @xmath15 flux function : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the beam energy and @xmath26 figure  [ flux ] shows examples of the @xmath15 flux functions multiplied by an integrated luminosity @xmath27  fb@xmath2 , as a function of the @xmath15 invariant mass for different center - of - mass energies ; threshold openings of different hadronic states are indicated .",
    "previous experiments measured the @xmath15 cross section for pseudoscalar meson production in the range .",
    "a low energy @xmath7 collider , such as da@xmath0ne , compensates the small cross section value with the high luminosity .",

    "the transition form factors @xmath28 at space - like momentum transfers can be measured with process  ( [ eq : gg - stat1 ] ) .",
    "they are important to discriminate among different phenomenological models relevant for the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution to the @xmath29 of the muon  @xcite .",
    "the form factor at negative @xmath30 appears in the production cross section of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 mesons in the reaction @xmath34 . by detecting one electron at large angle with respect to the beams , the form factor @xmath35 with one quasi ",
    "real and one virtual space - like photon ( @xmath36 ) can be measured for the on  shell pseudoscalar meson . for both @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons the region below 1",
    "gev@xmath37 is still poorly known but can be covered by kloe2 .",
    "furthermore , by selecting events in which both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are detected by the drift chamber ( instead of the tagger devices ) can provide experimental information on form factors @xmath40 , with two virtual photons .",
    "the two photon production of hadronic resonances is often advertised as one of the clearest ways of revealing their composition   @xcite . kloe2 with the study of @xmath42 decays can improve the experimental precision in the following energy ranges contributing to the solution of the open questions on low ",
    "energy hadron physics :    * 280 - 450 mev : the mark ii experiment  @xcite is the only one that has made a special measurement of the normalized cross - section for the @xmath43 channel near threshold , however , their data have very large error - bars ; * 450 - 850 mev : measure @xmath44 production in this region in both charge modes for our understanding of strong qcd coupling and the nature of the vacuum  @xcite ; * 850 - 1100 mev : accurate measurement of the @xmath43 and @xmath45 cross - sections ( integrated and differential ) .    the @xmath42 process is a clean electromagnetic probe to investigate the nature of the @xmath6 meson through the analysis of the @xmath44 invariant mass which is expected to be plainly affected by the presence of this scalar meson . a precision measurement of the cross - section of @xmath46 and @xmath47 would also complete the information from previous experiments allowing the determination of the @xmath15 couplings of the scalar mesons .",
    "the interest in this process is given by the @xmath49 contribution  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the @xmath50 coupling can be compared with that of pseudoscalars or other scalar states to clarify their quark structure . from figure  [ 4photon ] ,",
    "an excess of about 4000 events with respect to the expected background is evident at low 4 photons invariant mass ( @xmath51 ) values , consistent in shape with expectations  @xcite from @xmath52 events .",
    "the precise yield estimate depends on assumptions for the background processes .",
    "systematic study of the differential cross section and understanding of the @xmath49 contribution are in progress .",
    "the studies point out that kloe-2 with an integrated luminosity at the @xmath1 peak of @xmath53 5 fb@xmath2 can measure the @xmath47 cross - section with the same energy binning obtained from crystal ball @xcite , reducing the statistical uncertainty in each bin to 2% .",
    "decay and structures related to other processes with two @xmath54 are visible : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the cut on @xmath57  mev is explained by the requirement on the total energy in the calorimeter.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "using the kloe preliminary result on the branching fraction and the analysis efficiency obtained of @xmath59 , 1300 @xmath60 events are expected from the first year of data - taking at kloe2 , thus allowing an accuracy of 3% to be reached on the br(@xmath58 .",

    "in the @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the @xmath44 system is produced mostly with scalar quantum numbers . indeed , the available kinetic energy of the @xmath67 pair is suppressing high angular momentum contribution .",
    "furthermore , the exchange of vector mesons is forbidden by g - parity conservation . for these reasons ,",
    "only scalar mesons can participate to the scattering amplitude .",
    "the decay can be mediated by the @xmath6 , @xmath62 and @xmath68 exchange and by a direct contact term due to the chiral anomaly @xcite .",
    "the scalar contribution can be determined by fitting the dalitz plot of the @xmath69 system .",
    "the golden channel for kloe2 is the decay chain @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "the signal can be easily identified from the @xmath32 and @xmath72 invariant masses .",

    "the @xmath72 meson , being almost a pure su(3)@xmath78 singlet , is considered a good candidate to host a gluon condensate .",
    "kloe has extracted the @xmath72 gluonium content and the @xmath32-@xmath72 mixing angle  @xcite according to the model of ref .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath72 wave functions can be decomposed in three terms : the @xmath79 quark wave function @xmath80 , the @xmath81 component and the gluonium @xmath82 .",
    "the wave functions are written as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the @xmath32-@xmath72 mixing angle and @xmath85 is the gluonium fraction in the @xmath72 meson .",
    "the @xmath86 parameter can be interpreted as the mixing with a pseudoscalar glueball .    with the kloe2 data - taking above the @xmath1 peak , e.g. , at @xmath87 gev",
    ", it will be possible to measure the @xmath72 decay width @xmath88 through the measurement of the reaction @xmath89 .",
    "the measurement to 1% level of both the cross section and the @xmath90 would bring the fractional error on the @xmath72 total width , @xmath91 , to @xmath921.4% .",
