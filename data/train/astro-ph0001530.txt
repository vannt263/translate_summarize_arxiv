    "( 1998 ) include ci cam among the unclassified stars , while zorec ( 1998 ) includes it among the proto - planetary nebulae with dusty circumstellar envelopes .",
    "the binary nature of ci cam has been deduced from the extremely large ratio between iras 84  @xmath6 m and 12  @xmath6 m fluxes , which is close to that of binary systems that contain both a hot and a cool star ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have already reported on the two target of opportunity ( too ) observations performed by  during the 1998 april outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the energy spectra can not be fit by any simple model , and displayed a dramatic change from too1 ( performed on 1998 april 3 ) to too2 ( 1998 april 9 ) , namely the onset of a soft ( e@xmath72 kev ) component ( @xcite ) .",
    "a two - temperature bremsstrahlung model was used to describe the spectra of both toos , with temperatures ( @xmath8 , @xmath9)@xmath0(1.27 , 6.81 ) kev for too1 , and @xmath0(0.20 , 2.78 ) kev for too2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra for both toos included line features , identified with o , ne / fe - l , si , s , ca and fe - k . during too2 the o and ne / fe - l line energies decreased smoothly by @xmath09% , while the other lines did not show any shifts . because of the peculiar temporal variability of the source , frontera et  al .",

    "the nature of the compact object responsible for the x  ray emission is still unknown and controversial .",
    "the low energetics involved in the outburst and the absence of erratic time variability are unlike outbursts from neutron star or black hole x  ray novae ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the presence of x  ray , optical and radio emission , together with relativistic jets , is typical of neutron star and black hole systems .    in order to try to elucidate the nature of the compact object by studying the source spectral evolution during its quiescent phase ,",

    "all four nfis worked nominally during the observation .",
    "data were collected in direct mode , providing information on time , energy and position ( for the imaging instruments ) , and were processed using the saxdas 2.0 package ( @xcite ) except for pds data , where xas 2.1 ( @xcite ) was used .",
    "good data were selected using default criteria .",
    "for the imaging instruments , data were extracted from circular regions centered on the source position , with a @xmath11 radius for the lecs , and @xmath12 for the mecs ( the smaller mecs extraction region is due to s / n optimization above 4 kev ) .",
    "because of the low galactic latitude of the source , we did not use the standard background lecs blank field measurement , but instead the background was estimated from two semi - annuli near the outside of the field of view ( @xcite ) . the 3@xmath13 uncertainty obtained using this new method",

    "the exposure times for the lecs and mecs are 19  ks and 45  ks , respectively .",
    "this difference is due to the constraint that the lecs can only be operated in spacecraft night time .",

    "the amount of photo - electric absorption was not well constrained with any of the models , and it was therefore fixed at the galactic value ( @xcite ) .",

    "the major problem in understanding the  /ci cam system is the fact that the nature of the components in the system is not well established .",
    "miroshnichenko ( 1995 ) , by fitting the optical continuum , derived a spectral type for the two ci cam components as b0  v and k0  ii , and an interstellar extinction a@xmath103 of 1.1 .",

    "it is therefore likely that the normal object is a hot star showing the b[e ] phenomenon , with a dusty envelope responsible for the ir emission .",

    "the weakness of this approach is the peculiarity of the ",
    "phenomenology , that makes it a unique system amongst the class of sxts .    in the presence of a bh system an x",
    " ray outburst can occur either via an accretion disc instability or through a mass transfer instability ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter instability is unlikely to work in   because of the lack of hard ( @xmath1077 kev ) x  ray photons in the quiescent spectrum . indeed ,",
    "if the transient event is due to mass loss instability that arises in the secondary star as a result of x  ray illumination of the atmosphere , then hard x  ray photons are required in order to start the instability and therefore produce the outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed quiescent x  ray luminosity is not sufficient to trigger this mass - overflow instability ( see e.g.@xcite ) . indeed , for this instability to work it is necessary that the x  ray flux ( e@xmath1077 kev ) at the inner lagrangian point @xmath108 and the stellar flux at @xmath108 be comparable ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x  ray flux at @xmath108 ( assuming isotropic emission ) is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the distance between @xmath108 and the compact object .",
    "the stellar flux at @xmath108 is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the orbital separation .",
    "therefore the mass - transfer instability will work if @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the compact object and the companion masses , respectively . from our observed value @xmath1167",
    "kev)/@xmath117 we conclude that it is quite unlikely for the mass - overflow instability to take place in the  /ci cam system .",
    "the presence of an accretion disc would produce a strong temporal variability , and double peaked emission lines in the optical spectrum of sxts , expecially h@xmath71 and h@xmath73 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . while temporal variability was observed in   only in the soft ( e@xmath1181  kev ) energy range soon after the burst and attributed to the relativistic jets ( @xcite ) , the optical lines did not show the presence of double peaks . from our data we are not able to distinguish if this is due to the presence of circumstellar matter that smears the double peaked lines into single peaked ones , or due to the real absence of an accretion disc .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that there is a class of binaries , namely the cataclysmic variables , in which the presence of an accretion disc does not correspond to the presence of double peaked emission lines ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "finally , the short outburst duration and the temporal evolution of the x  ray spectrum from the outburst to quiescence is not typical of a bh system , which is characterized by a two - component spectrum ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : a thermal - like ( @xmath1191 kev ) and a high energy power - law tail that becomes comparatively stronger as the source weakens , leading to spectral changes not observed in ",
    "( however and do not show the soft component ; see @xcite ) .",
    "also the observed very high power - law index ( see table  [ tab : fits ] ) is in contrast with a typical bh system ( @xcite . an exception is ; @xcite ) .",
    "although we can not firmly exclude the presence of a bh in ",
    ", for these reasons we consider it unlikely .",
    "next the ns case : the presence of an accretion disc is unlikely because of the same considerations given for the bh case .",
    "also the presence of a hot , optically thin corona around the ns is excluded by the lack of hard x  ray emission in quiescence ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the majority of x  rays from a bh system probably comes from an accretion disc , in the case of a ns system the surface of the compact object can also be a source of x",
    " rays . the @xmath120  ev temperature observed in   and its x",
    " ray luminosity would correspond to an emitting area of @xmath01  km@xmath121 , too small to be produced at the surface of a ns unless funnelling of the accretion by the magnetic field onto a small area is introduced .",
    "this emitting area estimate is however based on the assumption of blackbody emission from the ns surface .",
    "it has been shown that because of cooling and back warming effects at the surface the spectrum differs significantly from that of a blackbody ( @xcite ) , with the effect that the emitting area can be understimated by as much as 2 orders of magnitudes .",
    "fits with hydrogen atmosphere spectral models to three type i bursting ns systems have shown the consistency of the emitting area with a 10  km radius ns ( @xcite ) . because our @xmath8 is quite similar to",
    "that observed in these three systems , we are not able to exclude that   contains a ns , although this is not supported by direct evidence , such as type i x  ray bursts or coherent pulsation ( that could have been smeared out by the circumstellar matter ) .",
    "we finally discuss the possibility that  / ci cam is a binary system containing a wd .",
    "thermal emission from the wd surface is not able to explain the observed quiescent x  ray luminosity unless only a very small fraction of the wd is responsible of the x  ray emission . indeed a typical photon energy of @xmath122  ev , where @xmath25 is the fraction of the wd surface that emits x  rays , is implied .",
    "therefore the most likely process is direct accretion from the companion star . for a 1  m@xmath123 , @xmath124=@xmath125  cm wd , the accretion rate is @xmath010@xmath126  d@xmath48 m@xmath123  yr@xmath3 .",
    "for such a low rate we expect that the main cooling mechanism is not free - free ( bremsstrahlung ) emission but thermal cyclotron emission ( @xcite ) , with the consequence that a two - temperature thermal spectrum is expected . indeed , rosat observations of am her systems in low - state show two - temperature spectra , with @xmath127 in qualitative agreement with that observed in  ( @xcite ) . anyway , a more detailed analysis , beyond the scope of this work , is needed to quantitatively describe the quiescence ",
    "x  ray spectrum .    in the framework of a wd system scenario , the outburst experienced by   would be associated to a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a @xmath128  m@xmath123 hot wd .",
    "the calculations performed by iben ( 1982 ; section  v , page 254 ) show that a peak duration of about one week or less , depending on the accretion rate , can be achieved , with a burst recurrence time @xmath107500 yr . furthermore",
    ", if the wd is young enough to suffer its first thermonuclear instability then it could be thermally unsettled ( @xcite ) , and therefore have not yet achieved the long term equilibrium between accretion rate and nuclear burning , with the possible consequence of a short post - burst phase .",
    "of course , for a quantitative description of the outburst a detailed application of the iben s calculations , beyond the scope of this paper , must be carried out . from a qualitatively point of view , the onset of the soft ( moving ) component observed during too2 ( @xcite ) would be explained in terms of ejection of the h- and he - rich layers .",
    "this would also explain the reduction of the he  i intensity observed in the quiescent optical spectrum .",
    "the outburst radio emission would be due to relativistic electrons accelerated in the outward - moving shock ( see e.g.@xcite ) , while the quiescent ( shell - like ) radio emission would be due to the slower motion of the layers .",
    "the low ionization state lines such as fe  ii observed from the optical spectrum could then arise on the surface of the cool component because of irradiation by the hot star ( see hoffmaister et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) and references therein ) , while the high - excitation emission lines such as fe  xxiv could be due either to an extended nebular shell shrouding the system , or to the reflection of the x  rays on the optically thick cold matter on the companion s surface .",
    "finally , we can exclude that the x ",
    "rays observed from   during quiescence come directly from the optical star if it is of spectral type ob .",
    "indeed , surveys with the einstein observatory showed that ob stars are emitters of soft ( @xmath74 kev ) x  ray photons ( @xcite ) .",
    "pallavicini et  al .",
    "( 1981 ) have shown that for ob stars a relation between x  ray and bolometric",
    "luminosity holds : @xmath129 . from a typical effective temperature for a b star of @xmath130",
    "@xmath131k we infer @xmath132  erg  s@xmath3 . with our value of @xmath133",
    "we obtain @xmath134 , at least two orders of magnitude greater that that expected from ob stars .",
    "therefore we conclude that the observed quiescent x  ray emission can not be due to a b star .",
    "we have shown that the quiescent x  ray spectrum observed from   can be fit with the same model used soon after its outburst , namely a two temperature bremsstrahlung .",
    "while the lower temperature , of the order of few hundreds ev , did not change between too2 and this observation , the higher temperature decreased considerably .",
    "the optical spectrum is very complex , and it is not possible to determine a spectral class for the system components .",
    "we discussed the nature of the compact object present in the system , and taking into account the peculiarity of the source , and the difficulty to compare its properties with those of typical systems , we conclude that it is unlikely for the  /ci cam system to contain a bh .",
    "both a ns and a wd are possible , but the wd hypothesis is more appealing because it better fits the observational scenario : a two - temperature thermal spectrum for the x  ray emission , the lack of any temporal variability , and the presence of shell like motion observed in radio , that can be explained in terms of ejection of h- and he - rich layers during the outburst due to a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "this also fits nicely with the observed reduction of the he  i line strengths when compared to observations performed before the outburst .",
    "finally , we can exclude that the x  ray luminosity observed in quiescence is due to the optical star if it is of spectral type ob .",
    "moreover , the optical emission can not be due to re - processing of the x ",
