    "the precise experimental data for tau lepton decays collected at b - factories ( both belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite ) provide an opportunity to measure the standard model ( sm ) parameters , such as the strong coupling constant , the quark - mixing matrix , the strange quark mass etc , and for searching new physics beyond sm .",
    "the leptonic decay modes of the tau lepton allow to test the universality of the lepton couplings to the gauge bosons .",
    "its hadronic decays ( the tau lepton , due to its high mass , is the only one that can decay into hadrons ) give information about the hadronization mechanism and resonance dynamics in the energy region where the methods of the perturbative qcd can not be applied .",
    "also hadronic flavour - violating and cp violating decays of tau lepton allow to search for new physics scenarios .",
    "hadronic tau lepton decays are also a tool in high - energy physics . in the last two years tau physics",
    "has received great attention after the discovery of the higgs boson by the cms and atlas collaborations @xcite .",
    "while this particle resembles in most features the sm higgs boson , the data , showing an enhancement of the two - photon event rates , as well as a reduced rate into tau and w pairs , could indicate extended symmetries .",
    "another yet unsolved question is related to the origin and precise nature of violation of symmetry under charge and parity transformations , the so called cp violation problem .    since the 90 s tauola is the main monte carlo ( mc ) generator to simulate tau - lepton decays @xcite .",
    "it has been used by the collaborations aleph @xcite , cleo @xcite , at both b - factories ( babar @xcite and belle @xcite ) as well at lhc @xcite experiments   for tau decay data analysis .",
    "the library tauola can be easily attached to any mc describing the production mechanism like koralb , koralz and kkmc @xcite .",
    "the code provides the full topology of the final particles including their spin .    in view of the forthcoming belle - ii project",
    "@xcite it is important to revise the tauola context in detail and we start our discussion by reviewing the models describing the tau - lepton decays into two ( @xmath0 ) and three pions ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "for @xmath2 decay channels with two mesons , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the hadronic current reads @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the vector and scalar form factors , respectively .    in the general case , a hadronic current of a two - meson tau - lepton decay mode depends on both vector ( @xmath9 ) and scalar ( @xmath10 ) form factors .",
    "however , in the isospin symmetry limit , @xmath11 , the scalar form factor vanishes for the two - pion decay mode and the current is described by the vector form factor only .",
    "the normalization coefficient ( @xmath12 ) depends on the mode and equals 1 for the two - pion mode .",
    "currently mc tauola includes four parametrizations for the vector form factor of two pions @xmath13 :    * kuhn - santamaria ( ks ) parametrization  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a resonance mass and @xmath16 is the resonance energy - dependent width that takes into account two - pion loops ; * gounaris - sakurai ( gs ) parametrization used by belle  @xcite , aleph and cleo collaborations : @xmath17 where @xmath18 includes the real part of the two - pion loop function ; * parametrization based on the resonance chiral lagrangian ( rchl )  @xcite : @xmath19 } \\ , , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the two - meson loop function  , eq.(a.3 ) in ref .",

    "@xcite and we leave it to be fitted .    in all the above parametrizations , except for the rchl one , the pion form factor is given by interfering amplitudes from the known isovector meson resonances @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 with relative strengths @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "although one could expect from the quark model that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are real , we allow the parameters to be complex ( following the belle , cleo and aleph analysis ) and their phases are left free in the fits . in the case of the rchl parametrization",
    "we restrict ourselves to the @xmath38 and @xmath33 contributions , with the relative @xmath39 strength ( that is a combination of the model parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath40 ) being a real parameter .    for the energy - dependent width of @xmath32-meson two - pion and two - kaon loop contributions",
    "are included for both rchl and combrchl parametrizations through the loop functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , whereas in the case of ks and gs the @xmath43 width is approximated only by the two - pion loops through @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 widths include only two - pion loops for all parametrizations except for the rchl one . in the case of the rchl one both two - pion and two - kaon loops",
    "are included .    results of the fit to the belle data @xcite are presented in figs .  1 and 2 . the best fit is with the gs pion form factor ( @xmath45 ) and the worst one is with the rchl one ( @xmath46 ) , which is not able to reproduce the high energy tail . as it was mentioned above , the two main differences of the rchl parametrization compared to the others are 1 ) the @xmath47-meson absence , 2 ) a real value of the @xmath33-meson strength . to check the influence of the @xmath34 on the rchl result",
    ", the @xmath34 resonance has been included in the same way as it was done for @xmath33 ; however , this inclusion has not improved the result ( see , fig .",
    "2 , the right panel ) .    in an effective field theory , like rchl",
    ", complex values come only from loops .",
    "therefore , we conclude that missing loop contributions could be responsible for the disagreement and that the complex value of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 parameters might mimic missing multiparticle loop contributions . the same conclusion was reached in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was stressed that the two - pseudoscalar loops can not incorporate all the inelasticity needed to describe the data and other multiparticle intermediate states can play a role .",
    "we are going to check this point by adding first a four - pion loop contribution to the @xmath39-resonance propagator .    in spite of the fact that the gs parametrization is able to reproduce the belle data , it has at least two misleading points .",
    "one of them is the complex strengths mentioned above , the other is the neglect of the two - kaon loops even for the @xmath43-resonance propagator .",
    "the last point will be the object of the further investigation .",
    "in the case of the combrchl parametrization the fitting curvature demonstrates not a smooth behaviour near @xmath48 . therefore more sophisticated fitting techniques will have to be implemented .",
    "when the @xmath2 lepton decays into three hadrons and a neutrino , the predominant decay mode involves three pions . in the general case",
    "lorentz invariance determines the decomposition of the hadronic current for a three - hadron final state in terms of five lorentz invariant structures @xcite multiplied by hadronic form factors ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50\\nonumber\\\\ & & + c_4   q^\\mu f_4(q^2,s_1,s_2 )   - { i \\over 4 \\pi^2 f^2 }       c_5 \\epsilon^\\mu_{.\\ \\nu\\rho\\sigma } p_1^\\nu",

    "the vector form factor vanishes for the three - pion modes due to the g - parity conservation @xmath58 . among the three hadronic form factors @xmath49 , @xmath59 which correspond to the axial - vector part of the hadronic tensor , only two are independent .",
    "the pseudoscalar form factor @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath61  @xcite , thus it is suppressed with respect to @xmath49 , @xmath59 .    in tauola",
    "the following three - pion form factors are available    * cpc version @xcite , that includes only the dominant @xmath62 mechanism production .",
    "the form factor is a product of the breit - wigner for the @xmath63 and @xmath43 meson ; * cleo parametrization ; it is based on the dalitz plot analysis carried out by the cleo collaboration and includes the following intermediate states : @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 can be either in s- or in d - wave ) , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , there are two variants of this parametrization .",
    "the former is based on the cleo @xmath69 analysis @xcite and applies the same current for the @xmath70 mode . the later uses the @xmath69 current from @xcite and the @xmath70 current from the unpublished cleo analysis  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to point out that a difference between these variants of the cleo parametrization is related with the scalar and tensor resonance contributions .",
    "all resonances are modelled by breit - wigner functions and the hadronic current is a weighted sum of their product  .",
    "the model parameters are resonance masses and widths as well as the weights ; * modified rchl parametrization @xcite .",
    "it was based on the rchl results for the three - pion currents  @xcite and an additional scalar resonance contribution .",
    "the rchl current is a sum of the chiral contribution corresponding to the direct vertex @xmath71 , single - resonance contributions , e.g. @xmath72 , double - resonance contributions , as @xmath73 . only vector and axial - vector are included in the rchl hadronic currents .",
    "more details about the parametrization can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the scalar resonance contribution was included phenomenologically by requiring the rchl structure for the currents and modelling the @xmath74-resonance by a breit - wigner function .",
    "the cleo parametrization for the @xmath70 mode has not yet been fitted to the babar preliminary data @xcite , so we used the old numerical values of the parameters fitted to the cleo data  @xcite .",
    "the fit to the babar data will be a task for future work .",
    "the one - dimensional distributions of the two- and three - pion invariant mass spectra calculated on the base of the modified rchl parametrization have been fitted to the babar preliminary data  @xcite .",
    "it must be pointed out that without the scalar resonance contribution the rchl parametrization provides a slightly better result than the cleo parametrization whereas the scalar resonance inclusion strongly improves the low two - pion mass invariant spectrum .",
    "discrepancy between theoretical spectra and experimental data can be explained by missing resonances in the model , such as the axial - vector resonance @xmath75 , the scalar resonance @xmath76 and the tensor resonance @xmath77 .",
    "inclusion of these resonances in the rchl framework will be a future task .",
    "comparison of the @xmath70 current in the framework of the modified rchl with the chpt result has demonstrated that the scalar resonance contribution has to be corrected to reproduce the low energy chpt limit .",
    "the corresponding calculation is in progress .",
    "in this note we have reviewed the physical frame of the monte carlo generator tauola for the part related with two- and three - pion decay modes .",
    "we have briefly described the models used for the hadronic currents as well as the results of the preliminary fits to the experimental data .    in the case of the two - pion modes",
    "we have made a fit to the belle data for the three parametrizations of the pion form factor .",
    "we have reproduced the data with the gounaris - sakurai pion form factor parametrizations while have failed with the rchl parametrization .",
    "we have concluded that the complex value of the resonance strength , used in the gounaris - sakurai parametrization , could mimic the missing multiparticle loops .",
    "this idea will be tested by adding the four - pion loops to the @xmath39-resonance propagator that will be the object of future study .    in the case of the three - pion mode tauola",
    "has two parametrizations for the hadronic current . at present",
    "we have fitted the modified resonance chiral current , which includes the @xmath74-meson contribution in addition to the resonance chiral lagrangian current , to the preliminary babar data .",
    "we have demonstrated that the difference between the model and the data is within @xmath78 at the high - tail of the two- and three - pion spectra .",
    "this discrepancy is related to the neglect of the resonances , like @xmath76 , @xmath75 and @xmath77 , in the model .",
    "the incorporation of these resonances is in progress .",
    "the same type of comparison will have to be done for the cleo @xmath70 current .",
    "one of the key points of the belle - ii project mentioned in introduction is tau physics  @xcite .",
    "the first physics run is planned in the fall of 2018 .",
    "both allowed and forbidden tau decay modes in standard model will be measured .",
    "it should record a 50 times larger data sample than the belle experiment until 2022 .",
    "indeed , the two- and three - pion decay modes will be used for measuring resonance parameters on one side and on the other these processes constitute an ever present background to the hadronic decay modes , forbidden in the standard model , for example the lepton flavour violated modes , like @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "all these considerations underline the importance of a precise theoretical description of the two- and three - pion decay modes .",
