    "early - type galaxies have been the focal point for probing one of the main expectations from hierarchical models of galaxy formation : the continuous assembly of galaxies with redshift via mergers .",

    "the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) and more recently abundant advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) deep imaging has provided significant advances .",
    "recent studies use the evolution of the fundamental plane for field ellipticals @xcite to constrain their evolution by comparing to cluster ellipticals , and their colors and number evolution as a function of redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a relatively new approach is the use of color inhomogeneities exploiting the resolved colors from hubble space telescope ( hst ) ellipticals to trace recent star formation activity @xcite .",
    "the studies chief discovery is that @xmath2 of hst selected spheroids have internal color variations , that depart from the expectation for passively evolved ellipticals ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in most cases the color variations manifest themselves via the presence of blue cores , an effect of opposite sign to that expected from metallicity gradients on passively evolved ellipticals . until now",
    ", blue cores in ellipticals have been solely associated with star formation attributed to differences in local potential well which makes star - formation more efficient in the central region of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , the physical nature of these objects has been elusive as they have been only detected in extremely deep hst observations ( e.g. the hdfs ) and deep spectroscopic observations have been rather limited ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the long integration times required to acquire high - signal spectrum of faint ellipticals .    in this letter",

    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 throughout .",

    "the spectroscopic information is based on the deep multi - object observations taken with the las campanas observatory magellan - clay 6.5 m telescope on may 26 , 27 and 28 , 2003 .",

    "targets for the program were selected following two criteria : 1 ) acquiring redshifts for the multiply - lensed galaxies discovered by @xcite , and 2 ) securing spectra for high redshift background galaxies .",
    "we were particularly careful to include in all our ldds2 masks the only spheroid galaxy with a blue core in the acs field of abell 1689 .",
    "we used our own idl reduction software to handle a large number of spectra efficiently .",
    "optimizing for background - limited data , our aim was to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio without resampling the data , so that groups of pixels carrying faint continuum signal have every chance of being detected as a coherent pattern in the final reduced image ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "we used the abell 1689 observations from the chandra x - ray observatory using acis - i in faint mode in two exposures of about 10.7 ks and 10.3 ks for a total of 21 ks after data reduction with the ciao software .",
    "we smoothed out the x - ray image of pixel size @xmath15 , with a @xmath16 gaussian filter and superimposed its flux contours over the acs image . from fig .",
    "[ fig : acs+chandra ] we see two main x - ray sources within the acs coverage of abell 1689 , the strongest coming from the central cd galaxy in abell 1689 @xcite and on the upper right of the acs image a strong x - ray source which we positively associate with the blue core spheroid in our study .",
    "we also considered the possibility of radio sources being associated with the object .",
    "based on radio wavelength archival data from the vla first radio survey @xcite , we found no radio counterpart associated with the blue core galaxy at the flux limits of the survey ( 0.97  mjy / beam ) .",
    "to search for color variations in spheroids , we examine galaxies in the acs field of abell 1689 via the construction of , , and color maps for all 742 galaxies with @xmath17 .",
    "although the effective area for this search is rather limited due to the presence of the cluster itself and the gravitational lens magnification , we successfully located one background spheroidal in one of the corners of the acs field - of - view with a strong central blue spot similarly to those reported previously ( see upper panel fig .  [",
    "fig : composed ] ) .",
    "this is the only spheroid with a blue core in the field , including all the objects associated with the cluster . to study the color maps and galaxy profiles , we first removed the dependence of the psf structure on wavelength by deconvolving the galaxy image in each bandpass with an appropriate psf using the iraf _ lucy _ task with flux conservation .",
    "the psfs were derived from several observations of a well - exposed star in acs calibration programs .",
    "the restored images were then convolved identically with the f625w psf , thus removing any color dependence due to the psf shape .",
    "we used this images to create the galaxy resolved color maps .",
    "these show a prominent blue core with color differences of @xmath18  mag in , @xmath19  mag in  and @xmath20 in .",
    "we verified if the galaxy possesses an unresolved nucleus , a common signature of nuclear activity , by comparing its nuclear profile in each filter with that of an observed psf .",
    "the galaxy radial profiles were extracted with the iraf _ radprof _ task with `` background '' subtraction defined in an annulus of radius 6  pixels ( @xmath21 ) and width 2  pixels , located inside the host galaxy .",
    "the resulting galactic profiles were then compared with those of the psf star .",
    "a positive point source identification was ascertained in all four filters out to a radius of 5  pixels ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the match of the galaxy s nuclear profile with the psf is best in f475w filter , where the host galaxy contamination is the least .",
    "the f625w profiles exhibit the largest deviation possibly from contamination by  line emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : composed ] ) .    the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : composed ] ) shows prominent emission lines that indicate the presence of an active nucleus and also suggest star formation activity .",
    "the galaxy contains the distinctive 2 ,  and  nebular lines associated with agns .",
    "however , the signal is not high enough to see the broad - line component for the 2  and permitted lines , and h@xmath23 lies outside the observed spectral range .",
    "the continuum does not follow a pure power - law , but rather includes some absorption features such as mgb .",
    "additional information confirming the presence of an active nucleus comes from the x - ray observations .",
    "the galaxy is detected as a point source in the x - ray with a very high signal and with a total of @xmath24 net counts in the 0.310  kev band , extracted from a circular region of 8 . from a difference of almost 9 months between the two chandra observations",
    ", the source seems to be variable with a luminosity decrease of @xmath25 at a 2 sigma c.l . in the soft band ( @xmath26  kev ) .",
    "however , we do not detect any variability in the hard band .",
    "this is expected , since variability is routinely found in x - ray sources in chandra surveys @xcite . to correct for possible contamination from the diffuse emission from the cluster , which is very strong in the position of the galaxy image , we experimented extracting three different backgrounds around the galaxy and determined that the background is not affecting our results significantly .",
    "due to the low number of net detected counts , we used the @xcite statistics to fit the spectrum of the galaxy with xspec ( v11.3 ) the energy range @xmath27  kev , to avoid calibration uncertainties at energies lower than 0.6  kev .",
    "our model is a simple power - law plus a galactic absorption and an intrinsic absorption .",
    "we find a spectral slope of @xmath28 and an upper limit to the intrinsic absorption of @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "the redshift is frozen to @xmath1 and the galactic absorption to @xmath31 @xmath30 .",
    "the luminosity in the rest - frame @xmath26  kev and @xmath32  kev band is @xmath33 erg s@xmath10 and @xmath34 erg s@xmath10 respectively ( see table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "both the absence of significant absorption and the high luminosity point towards a type  i agn .",
    "we also notice a residual around 4 kev , which is the observing frame energy expected for a possible fe line complex at the rest  frame energy of @xmath35  kev .",
    "therefore , we repeated the fits by adding a simple gaussian line and leaving free the energy , the width and normalization of the line .",
    "we obtain the best fit values : @xmath36  kev , and equivalent width ew@xmath37  kev .",
    "in addition , the best fit slope of the power law is @xmath38 , while the upper limits on the intrinsic absorption are somewhat larger but consistent with the values obtained without the line .",
    "the decrease in c  statistics with respect to the model without the line is @xmath39 . considering that we added three free parameters defining the line , such a decrement correspond to a significance level of about 90% . however , since the best ",
    "fit energy of the line is what we expected for the redshifted 6.4 kev k ",
    "shell transition from fe , the significance of the detected line is more than 2 sigma .",
    "we conclude that we possibly detected a fe line originated in the nuclear region , an occurrence to be verified with further observations already scheduled for a1689 ( public release march 2005 ) .",
    "we examine the relationship between the x - ray and optical luminosities of the galaxy and its connection with galaxy types .",
    "we compare the galaxy @xmath40 luminosity and @xmath41-band absolute ab magnitude with the galaxies in the @xcite chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) catalog of x - ray sources .",
    "the @xmath41 absolute magnitude is computed using the @xmath42-correction derived from the type  i spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the chatzichristou ( private communication ) library of seds . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oii - lx ] ( upper panel ) , we compare  and @xmath41 for the galaxy ( solid star ) and the cdf - s sample .",
    "it is interesting to note that the galaxy has an x - ray luminosity in the same range as low luminosity qsos ( squares ) and type  i agns ( filled circles ) .",
    "however , the galaxy s @xmath41 flux is more similar to that of type  ii agns ( open circles ) or normal galaxies ( triangles ) .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy s non - thermal component is very strong and dominant for high - energy wavelengths while there is a star - forming stellar component that contributes most of the light at optical wavelengths .",
    "we also investigate the relation between the line flux ratios @xmath43  and 5007@xmath43 .",
    "this diagnostic diagram has been used for the spectral classification of emission - line galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oii - lx ] ( lower panel ) , we compare the line fluxes between the spheroid galaxy ( solid star ) and the values for different galaxy types taken from the spectrophotometric catalog of galaxies of @xcite .",
    "we find that the galaxy has @xmath43  values in the same range as type  ii agns and hii galaxies and that its 5007@xmath43  flux is more similar to hii and normal galaxies .",
    "moreover , the typical 5007@xmath43  and @xmath43  values of type  i agns ( solid circles ) are significantly lower than the values of the galaxy .",
    "we consider this as further evidence for the dual nature of the galaxy .",
    "although the spectrum shows agn signatures such as mgii and , the strength of the  line suggest the presence of ongoing stellar formation processes . if we associate the  flux to stellar activity we can make a rough estimate of the galaxy star formation rate ( sfr ) based on its  luminosity , @xmath44 $ ] , using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "whereas the rates derived from  are less precise than those from h@xmath23 due to uncertainties in the assumed h@xmath23 extinction , it is still possible to obtain a reasonable estimate for the galaxy sfr .",
    "we compute @xmath44 = 2.79\\times 10^{41}$ ]  ergs  s@xmath10 which yields a sfr  @xmath45  m@xmath46yr@xmath10 .",
    "this represents a modest rate , lower than in massive starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "however it is consistent with normal disk galaxies and sfr computed for spheroids with similar blue cores , based purely on models @xcite .",
    "the  has been employed as a sfr indicator ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because of its link to x - ray binaries , @xcite , young supernova remnants and galactic winds associated to star - forming galaxies",
    ". additionally @xcite have derived the relation between and sfr , consistent with @xcite except for low sfr @xcite .",
    "could the observed spheroid  be solely associated with star formation ?",
    "it is hard to rule out that a fraction of it is not related , however the 210  kev hard band luminosity @xmath47  erg  s@xmath10 , would suggest an extremely high sfr ( @xmath48  m@xmath46yr@xmath10 ) in contradiction with the optical data suggestive of low star - formation activity .",
    "there is also a tight correlation between @xmath49 radio luminosity and  for starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , we report no signal for the galaxy at radio wavelengths ( i.e.   2 ) .",
    "based on the galaxy s spectral features and its x - ray luminosity , we have determined the presence of an active non - thermal component in the blue spheroid galaxy identified in the background field of abell  1689 .",
    "star formation and agns have been suggested to be closely inter - connected @xcite .",
    "however , they have been related mostly with seyfert  2 galaxies which are heavily absorbed in their hard x - ray emission not the case for this galaxy . moreover",
    ", the fact that we observe such a prominent blue core in the acs images suggests that the central region is not particularly affected by dust obscuration , nor that it contains a dusty enshrouded starburst . on the other hand",
    "most present - day galaxies harbor supermassive black holes , which may have an important role in the formation of ellipticals and bulges @xcite .",
    "it is tantalizing to relate the galaxy central blue light with the rapid mass infall into a central black hole which might trigger star formation , and the subsequent fueling of gas into the agn which might be the phenomenon we are observing .",
    "the advent of wide areas with deep publicly available hst / acs multicolor imaging and chandra x - ray observations will make it possible to examine whether the association between agns and blue core spheroids is a common feature or just a rare occurrence .",
    "if they prove to be a constant feature in blue core spheroids , these might represent a new galaxy subclass and may provide evidence for a more delayed formation scenario for early - type galaxies .",
