    "a hot neutron star is born following the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star just after the supernova explosion .",
    "the interior temperature of a neutron star at its birth is of order @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the high temperature of these stages can not be neglected with respect to the fermi temperature throughout the calculation of its structure .",
    "this shows that the equation of state of the hot dense matter is very important for investigating the structure of a newborn neutron star .",
    "depending on the total number of nucleons , a newborn neutron star evolves either to a black hole or to a stable neutron star @xcite .",
    "hence , calculation of the maximum mass of hot neutron star is of special interest in astrophysics .",
    "as we go from surface to the center of a neutron star , at sufficiently high densities , the matter is expected to undergo a transition from hadronic matter , where the quarks are confined inside the hadrons , to a state of deconfined quarks . finally , there are up , down and strange quarks in the quark matter .",
    "other quarks have high masses and do not appear in this state .",
    "glendenning has shown that a proper construction of the hadron - quark phase transition inside the neutron stars implies the coexistence of nucleonic matter and quark matter over a finite range of the pressure .",
    "therefore , a mixed hadron - quark phase exists in the neutron star and its energy is lower than those of the quark matter and nucleonic matter @xcite .",
    "these show that we can consider a neutron star as composed of a hadronic matter layer , a mixed phase of quarks and hadrons and , in core , a quark matter .",
    "recent chandra observations also imply that the objects rx j185635 - 3754 and 3c58 could be neutron stars with the quark core @xcite .",
    "burgio et al . have investigated the structure of neutron stars with the quark core at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite with the brueckner - bethe - goldstone formalism to determine the equation of state of the hadronic matter , they have used .",
    "we have calculated the structure properties of the cold neutron star by considering a quark phase at its core @xcite and compared the results with our previous calculations for the neutron star without the quark core @xcite . in these works , we have employed the lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) method for the hadronic matter calculations . in the present paper , we intend to extend these calculations for the hot neutron star with the quark core .",
    "as it was mentioned in the previous section , we consider a neutron star composed of a hadronic matter ( hadron phase ) , a mixed phase of quarks and hadrons , and a quark core ( quark phase ) .",

    "we use the mit bag model for the quark matter calculations . in this model ,",

    "[ mr1 ] and [ mr2 ] show the gravitational mass versus the radius for both cases of the neutron star with and without the quark core at two different temperatures .",
    "at each temperature , it is seen that there is a reasonable difference between the mass - radius relations of these two cases of the neutron star .",
    "however , for both cases , we see that the radius decreases as the mass increases . by comparing figs .",
    "[ mr1 ] and [ mr2 ] , we can see that the decreasing rate of the radius versus the mass is substantially different for different temperatures .",
    "our results for the maximum gravitational mass of the hot neutron star with the quark core and the corresponding values of radius and central mass density have been given in tables [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] for two different temperatures .",
    "our results for the case of hot neutron star without quark core have been also presented for comparison . for different temperatures , it is seen that the inclusion of the quark core considerably reduces the maximum mass of the hot neutron star .",
    "this is due to the fact that by including the quark core for the neutron star , the equation of state becomes softer than that without the quark core .",
    "however , we do not see any substantial changes for the radius and central mass density of these two cases of the hot neutron star .",
    "for the hot neutron star , from the surface toward the center , we have considered a pure hadronic matter layer , a mixed phase of quarks and hadrons in a range of densities which are determined by employing the gibbs conditions , and a pure quark matter in the core , to calculate its equation of state at finite temperature . for calculating the equation of state of the hot hadronic matter ,",
    "we have applied the lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) method at finite temperature .",
    "the equation of state of the hot quark matter has been computed using the mit bag model with the bag constant @xmath99 . using this equation of state",
    ", we have solved the tov equation by numerical method to determine the structure properties of the hot neutron star with the quark core at @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "then , we have compared the results of these calculations with those for the hot neutron star without the quark core . it is found that our results for the maximum gravitational mass of the neutron star with a quark core are less than those of the neutron star without the quark core .",
