    "recent breakthrough measurements of non - zero neutrino mixing angle @xmath9 from daya bay and reno experiments  @xcite , which are consistent with the data from t2k , minos and double chooz experiments  @xcite , indicated a possibility of the cp violation in the lepton sector . now",
    "the main issue of the neutrino physics is shifting to cp phase , mass hierarchy as well as further precise determination of @xmath9 . for making a progress towards this direction by analyzing data from the next - generation long - baseline and atmospheric experiments , neutrino - nucleon and neutrino - nucleus scattering need to be understood within 10% or better accuracy , for the relevant neutrino energy region from sub gev to a few gev , and @xmath10 ( gev / c)@xmath11 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : q2 ] ) for the definition of @xmath12 .",
    "this energy region covers neutrino - nucleus interactions of different characteristics , namely , the quasi - elastic ( qe ) , resonant ( res ) , and deep - inelastic scatterings ( dis ) .",
    "thus a combination of different expertise is necessary to tackle the problem .",
    "this motivates theorists and experimentalists to get together to organize a new collaboration , e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with the res region which covers the @xmath13 peak and , through the second and third resonance regions , up to the region overlapping with the dis region .",
    "previous models for the weak single pion production off the nucleon in the res region , some of them are for the @xmath13-region only , can be categorized into three kinds of approaches .",
    "models of the first kind of approaches consist of a coherent sum of resonance contributions  @xcite .",
    "the second one additionally has non - resonant mechanisms of the tree level  @xcite .",
    "the third one considers the rescattering also so that the @xmath14 unitarity is maintained , and such a model for the @xmath13-region was developed by two of the present authors  @xcite .",
    "these models for the elementary processes have been used as basic ingredients to construct neutrino - nucleus reaction models .",
    "although the previous models mentioned above consider only the single - pion production , double - pion production is comparably important in the res region .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 and kaon productions also take place , and they can be a background for proton - decay experiments  @xcite .",
    "some models for the weak kaon productions through the strangeness conserving ( @xmath2 ) reactions  @xcite and the strangeness changing ( @xmath16 ) reactions  @xcite , belonging to the second kind of approaches discussed above , have been developed so far . in order to describe those meson production reactions ,",
    "the reaction model has to take into account the coupled - channels effects and satisfy unitarity for the multichannel reactions .",
    "however , such a model for the neutrino - nucleon reactions has not been developed so far .    in this context ,",
    "our recent development of a dynamical coupled - channels ( dcc ) model is quite encouraging  @xcite .",
    "our dcc model is based on a comprehensive analysis of @xmath17 reactions in the res region , taking account of the coupled - channels unitarity including the @xmath18 channel .",
    "an extension of the dcc model to the neutrino reaction is fairly straightforward .",
    "although we need to construct a dynamical axial - current model for a full development , we can actually calculate the neutrino - induced forward ( @xmath19 ) meson production cross sections , characterized by the structure function @xmath6 , from the cross sections for @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) by invoking the pcac hypothesis .",
    "thus , in this report , we attempt to make a first step of extending the dcc model to the weak sector , by calculating @xmath22 for @xmath2 @xmath23 ( @xmath24 : lepton ) with the pcac hypothesis , thereby setting a starting point for a future full development .",
    "we also remark that our estimate of the magnitudes of @xmath25 and @xmath26 forward cross sections is , for the first time , based on a model that has been rather extensively tested by the data of @xmath14 and @xmath27 reactions in the res region .",
    "the rest of this report is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "this model aims to describe @xmath14 production reactions in the @xmath116 region and thus contains only @xmath116 as resonance contributions .",

    "[ sec : form-1 ] .",
    "the sl model directly gives the @xmath6 functions because it consists of both the vector and axial currents , and reasonably reproduce available neutrino - induced pion production data  @xcite .",
    "comparing dotted curves with thin solid curves that are the full @xmath14 production reactions up to @xmath8 gev , we clearly see that contributions from other than @xmath116 , e.g. , higher resonances and/or backgrounds , become relevant above @xmath119 gev . also , the good agreement between the thin solid and dotted curves for @xmath120 gev indicates a reliability of calculating @xmath6 from the @xmath4 total cross sections with the pcac hypothesis .",
    "it is noted that , even above the @xmath116 region , the @xmath6 function still has bump structures and is not a monotonous function in @xmath121 .",
