    "thermonuclear reactions are of enormous importance for the physics of stars and of our sun .",
    "the general formalism that describes these reactions exists since a long time and there is a wide consensus about our good understanding of the relevant physics  @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative calculations of specific reaction rates need experimental inputs and theoretical assumptions .",
    "_ cross sections must be known_. in the best cases , they can be directly measured at the relevant energies ; other cross sections can be only measured at higher energies and need to be extrapolated ; in some situations only theoretical predictions exist ( for a recent review of the cross sections relevant to the sun see ref .",
    "in addition , rates depend on weighted thermal averages of the cross sections ; therefore , knowledge about _ the thermal distribution is also needed_.    because many nuclear reactions in the stellar burning core proceed by way of quantum penetration of a high coulomb barrier , their cross sections grow exponentially with energy . therefore , thermal averages do not probe the average energy of the distribution ( @xmath2 ) , but its high - energy tail .",
    "consequently , _ rates are sensitive to a relatively small part of the distribution_.    the ion velocity distribution in stellar calculations is always assumed maxwellian  .",
    "in fact , it is almost universally accepted as a fact that physical conditions in the solar interior ( density and temperature ) lead to an equilibrium velocity distribution that is maxwellian . in this article",
    "we review the assumptions underlying this general statement , discuss why they are only approximately true , and argue that the consequent _ small corrections to the distribution have significant effects on the rates_.    the dynamics of the solar plasma is not trivial , since at such densities and temperatures there is no clear scale separation between collective and individual degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the presence of more than just one energy scale ( @xmath2 ) in the relevant range of energies results in deviations from the pure exponential behavior , @xmath3 , which is determined only by @xmath2 .",
    "we have tried several new approaches to this strongly interacting many - body system for which a realistic microscopic calculation does not exist yet .    in one approach  @xcite",
    "we exploit the knowledge that the distribution in the solar interior can not be too much different from the maxwellian one and add small corrections ( higher - order terms in a derivative expansion ) to the coefficients of the standard fokker - plank equation .",
    "tsallis  @xcite and druyvenstein - like distributions are immediately generated .    a second approach  @xcite focuses on the electric microfields that have been shown to exists in plasmas and tries to link their distribution and the connected effective cross sections with deviations from the maxwellian distribution .",
    "different classes of microfields distributions and effective cross sections yield several non - maxwellian distributions among which we again find tsallis and druyvenstein - like distributions .",
    "the third approach has been just started and aims to connect the distribution of collective variables  @xcite to memory effects and long - time correlations between velocities .",
    "there should exist solutions compatible with the tsallis distribution and/or other non - maxwellian distributions .",
    "these three approaches are not exhaustive and not necessary alternative .",
    "nevertheless , it is suggestive that all of them point in the same direction : _ the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of velocity should have small but nonnegligible corrections in the solar plasma and the tsallis distribution could provide a better description_.    nowadays solar modeling seems to have reached a satisfactory stage  @xcite . the inclusion in the latest models of higher - order effects , such as the diffusion of heavy elements , brings the theoretical predictions in good agreement even with the detailed helioseismological data  @xcite .",
    "however , there still exist a discrepancy between the solar neutrino experiments and the predicted neutrino fluxes  @xcite . in this context",
    ", there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to answering questions such as : how large are the uncertainties of the solar model input parameters ?",
    "has something been left out of standard solar models ?",
    "how does this affects predictions for the fluxes and the status of solar neutrino problem ( snp )  @xcite ?",
    "therefore , we find extremely important to assess the consequences of the possible small deviations from the standard statistics on the solar model and , in particular , on the neutrino fluxes .",
    "at least two effects should be considerd : changes of the total rates caused by the different thermal average and modifications of the shape of the energy spectra . the effect on the rates",
    "was already considered by clayton  @xcite two decades ago .",
    "new experimental data , better solar models and a considerable better understanding of nonstandard distributions and of how they can arise in solar plasmas convinced us of the necessity of reconsider this earlier suggestion . even if experimental detection of small modifications of the neutrino spectra might appear still far from being possible , it is useful to have a clear assessment of what the signal would be .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secrate ] we review the physics of subbarrier thermonuclear reactions and how the velocity distribution influences reaction rates . section  [ secplasma ] , which is dedicated to the solar plasma , contains the central part of our work : three approaches to velocity distribution calculation and the resulting nonstandard distributions . in sec .",
    "[ secmodirate ] we calculate the reaction rates with the modified distributions , while we obtain the neutrino spectrum from the @xmath1 reaction in the presence of tsallis statistics and compare it to the standard one in sec .",

    "[ secsnp ] , and sec .",
    "[ secconclu ] is reserved to our conclusions .",
    "reliable calculations of nuclear reaction rates in stellar interiors is fundamental for a quantitative understanding of the structure and evolution of stars .",
    "in fact , while the overall stellar structure is rather robust , changes of some of the rates by few percent can produce detectable discrepancies , when precise measurements are possible , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the case of the solar photon and neutrino luminosity , and mechanical eigenfrequencies  @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we review the basic physics underlying thermonuclear reactions and the main ingredients of their calculation  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a gas with @xmath4 particles of type 1 and @xmath5 particles of type 2 per cubic centimeter and relative velocity @xmath6 ; the reaction rates @xmath7 ( the number of reactions per unit volume and unit time ) is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the nuclear cross section of the reaction .",
    "the reaction rate per particle pair is defined as @xmath10 where the particles distribution function @xmath11 is a local function of the temperature .",
    "therefore , the reaction rate per particle pair @xmath12 is determined by the specific cross section and by the velocity distribution function of the incoming particles . in general , cross sections",
    "do not have very strong dependence on the energy , when no energy barrier is present and away from resonances .",
    "therefore , most of the contribution to @xmath12 comes from particles with energy of the order of @xmath13 , and the dependence on the specific form of @xmath11 is weak .",
    "we shall see that the situation is very different in the presence of the coulomb barrier .",
    "most of the nuclear reactions that power the stars are between charged particles .",
    "these particle must penetrate a coulomb barrier that is very large in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the penetration probability is proportional to the gamow factor @xmath14}$ ] , where @xmath15 is the sommerfeld parameter , @xmath16 is the fine structure constant and @xmath17 is the reduced mass ; this factor can be also written as @xmath18}$ ] , defining the gamow energy @xmath19 .",
    "this exponentially small probability makes the cross section grow extremely fast with the energy ; therefore , one usually defines the astrophysical @xmath20 factor , whose energy dependence is weaker @xmath21    this reaction mechanism has at least two main consequences for the study of stellar structure .",
    "\\(1 ) since the bulk of particles in the stellar plasma have thermal energies of the order of @xmath2 , which is far below the coulomb barrier , only a small number of particles in the high - energy tail of the distribution has a chance of reacting : this high - energy tail plays a crucial rle for the reaction rates , which becomes very sensitive to small changes of the distribution .",
    "\\(2 ) the cross sections of some of the reactions , _ e.g. _ , weak reactions with coulomb barrier such as @xmath22 , are extremely small at the low energies relevant to stellar physics ( of the order of tens of kev for reactions in the sun ) .",
    "therefore , some of them have only been calculated theoretically , others have only been measured at higher energies and then extrapolated to the lower thermal energies of the stellar interiors .",
    "both these two facts lead to considerable uncertainties in the reaction rates .",
    "the second point has been extensively discussed , and it is common opinion that the present standard theory of stars , and in particular of the sun  @xcite , has already taken properly into account the uncertainties in the cross sections . on the contrary , the first point ,",
    "the possibility that small changes of the particle energy distribution could strongly affect reaction rates , has received little attention  @xcite , or dismissed on the ground that the energy distribution in stars is allegedly well - know  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall discuss mainly this point , the energy distribution in stellar plasmas and its implication for nuclear rates .",
    "normal stellar matter , such as the one in the sun , is nondegenerate , _",
    "i.e. _ , quantum effects are small ( in fact , they are small for electrons and completely negligible for ions ) , it is nonrelativistic , and it is in good thermodynamical equilibrium . on this ground ,",
    "the particle velocity distribution is almost universally taken to be a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , without much questioning .",
    "however , derivations of the ubiquitous maxwell - boltzmann distribution are based on several assumptions  @xcite . in a kinetical approach , one assumes ( 1 ) that the collision time be much smaller than the mean time between collisions , ( 2 ) that the interaction be sufficiently local , ( 3 ) that the velocities of two particles at the same point are not correlated ( boltzmann s stosszahlansatz ) , and ( 4 ) that energy is locally conserved when using only the degrees of freedom of the colliding particles ( no significant amount of energy is transferred to collective variables and fields ) . in the equilibrium statistical mechanics approach",
    ", one uses the assumption that the velocity probabilities of different particles are independent , corresponding to ( 3 ) , and that the total energy of the system could be expressed as the sum of a term quadratic in the momentum of the particle and independent of the other variables , and a term independent of momentum , but if ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are not valid the resulting effective two - body interaction is not local and depends on the momentum and energy of the particles . finally , even when the one - particle distribution is maxwellian , additional assumptions about correlations between particles are necessary to deduce that the relative - velocity distribution , which is the relevant quantity for rate calculations , is also maxwellian .    at least in one limit",
    "the mb distribution can be rigorously derived : systems that are dilute in the appropriate variables , whose residual interaction is small compared to the one - body energies . in spite of the fact that the effects of the residual interaction can not be neglected , as a good first approximation the solar interior can be studied in this dilute limit ; therefore , it is reasonable to suppose that the velocity distribution in the sun is not too far from the maxwellian one .",
    "this fact is consistent with the many successes of the standard treatment and suggests that we start discussing the standard results and improve them later .    in the ordinary treatment ,",
    "the single particle energy distribution for protons and other ions is taken as @xmath23 when this distribution and a cross section of the form of eq .",
    "( [ sigmas ] ) are inserted in eq .",
    "( [ sigmav ] ) , the resulting integrand goes to zero both at large energies , because of the exponentially small number of particles , see eq .",
    "( [ mbdis ] ) , and also at small energies , because of the exponentially small probability of barrier penetration , see eq .",
    "( [ sigmas ] ) .",
    "in fact , the integrand has a maximum at the temperature - dependent energy @xmath24 which it is called the most effective energy  @xcite , since most of the particles that react have energies close to @xmath25 ; we have defined the adimensional parameter @xmath26^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "figure  [ figgamow ] gives a pictorial demonstration of how the gamow peak originates .",
    "the exponentially decreasing function ( solid curve labeled `` maxwell '' ) is the maxwellian factor @xmath3 multiplied times 400 to emphasize the tail of the distribution .",
    "the rapidly growing function ( dotted curve labeled `` penetration factor '' ) is the factor @xmath27 with the choice of @xmath28 , which corresponds to a most effective energy @xmath29 ; it has been arbitrarily normalized such that it is equal to 400 at @xmath30 .",
    "the product of the two functions yields the gamow peak ( solid curve labeled gamow ) , which has been normalized to one at its maximum ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the area under the maxwellian curve for energies larger than about @xmath32 ( where one finds most of the contribution to the peak ) is less then 0.3% of the total area .    in this framework ,",
    "one performs the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sigmav ] ) using the saddle - point asymptotic expansion around the maximum @xmath25 of the gamow peak and finds that the reaction rate per particle pair is , apart for small calculable corrections , @xmath33    table  [ table1 ] reports the values of @xmath25 in units of @xmath13 ( @xmath34 ) for several reactions .",
    "we notice that @xmath25 can be much larger than @xmath13 and , therefore , only a very small number of particles in the far tail of the distribution contributes to the rate , _",
    "e.g. _ , for the @xmath35he + @xmath35he reaction the most effective energy is about @xmath36 : there are less than about 40 particles out of a million that have energies so large or larger .",
    "it is not sufficient anymore to know that the maxwellian distribution is good approximation , we must be sure that there are no corrections to a very high accuracy .",
    "as discussed in sec .  [ secrate ] , several subtle points must be assumed in the derivation of the often - taken - for - granted maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "likewise , one often assumes that the solar core could be treated as an ideal ( debye ) plasma .",
    "however , there are physical conditions and/or specific applications that needs higher accuracy for which becomes necessary to take into account modifications of the standard plasma theory .    in this section",
    "we discuss how the physics of non - ideal plasmas , and in particular of the solar interior , can result in equilibrium velocity distributions that deviate from the `` standard '' one .",
    "in addition , we present specific physical frameworks where non - maxwellian distributions arise and microscopic mechanisms that allow a reliable estimation of the size of deviations .      in literature ,",
    "a plasma is characterized by the value of the plasma parameter @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is of the order of the interparticle average distance ( @xmath40 is the average density ) .",
    "the plasma parameter is a measure of the ratio of the mean ( coulomb ) potential energy and the mean kinetic ( thermal ) energy .",
    "depending on the value of the plasma parameter , we can distinguish three regimes that are characterized by different effective interactions and require different theoretical approaches .",
    "* @xmath41 .",
    "the plasma is described by the debye - hckel mean - field theory as a dilute weakly interacting gas .",
    "the screening debye length @xmath42 is much greater than the average interparticle distance @xmath43 , hence there is a large number of particles in the debye sphere ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "collective degrees of freedom are present ( plasma waves ) , but they are weakly coupled to the individual degrees of freedom ( ions and electrons ) and , therefore , do not affect their distribution .",
    "binary collisions through screened forces produce the standard velocity distribution . *",
    "the mean coulomb energy potential is not much smaller of the thermal kinetic energy and the screening length @xmath46 .",
    "it is not possible to clearly separate individual and collective degrees of freedom .",
    "the presence of at least two different scales of energies of the same rough size produces deviations from the standard statistics which describe the system in terms of a single scale , @xmath2 . * @xmath47 .",
    "this is a high - density / low - temperature plasma where the coulomb interaction and quantum effects start to dominate and determine the structure of the system .      in the solar interior",
    "the plasma parameter is @xmath48 ; therefore , the solar core is a weakly non - ideal plasma where the debye - hckel conditions are only approximately verified .",
    "similar behaviors are expected in other astrophysical systems characterized by plasma parameters in the range @xmath49 ; examples are brown dwarfs , the jupiter core and stellar atmospheres .",
    "studies of systems with this intermediate values of @xmath37 are the most difficult ; it is possible to use / combine several different approaches none of which , however , is completely justified .",
    "the reaction time necessary to build up screening after a hard collision can be estimated from the inverse solar plasma frequency @xmath50  sec , and it is comparable to the collision time @xmath51  sec .",
    "therefore , several collisions are likely necessary before the particle looses memory of the initial state and the scattering process can not be considered markovian .",
    "in addition , screening starts to become dynamical : the time necessary to build up again the screening after hard collisions is not negligible any more .",
    "for concreteness we consider three possible approaches to weakly - noninteracting plasmas that yield nonstandard distributions .",
    "these approaches are not alternative , but they could perhaps be seen as different and partial descriptions of the same complicated physical problem . the main purpose of their presentation is to give concrete examples of how nonstandard statistics arises .",
    "however , they are not by any mean the last word on the topic : we must still develop their full potentiality and alternative approaches must also be pursued .      in the fokker - plank context it is possible to introduce corrections ( i ) to the lowest order friction coefficient @xmath52 , and ( ii ) to the lowest order diffusion coefficient @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "similar corrections have already been shown to exist in hydrodynamic systems .",
    "_ we assume that the system is not too far from the standard regime that leads to the mb distribution , so that an expansion starting from the usual formalism makes sense_. the fokker - planck equation , given in the landau form , is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the distribution probability of particles with velocity @xmath6 at time @xmath56 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the dynamical friction and diffusion coefficients .",

    "if @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we find a druyvenstein - like distribution : @xmath80 which has also the functional form suggested by clayton  @xcite to parameterize a small deviation ( depletion ) from the maxwellian statistics .",
    "each particle is affected by the total electric field distribution due to the other charges in the plasma .",
    "if external fields and large scale internal fields due to collective modes are subtracted from the total electric field , the single particle see the remaining field as a relative small random component .",

    "as already mentioned , in the solar core @xmath48 , hence , the order of magnitude of the deviation parameter @xmath99 is about @xmath101 and in this intermediate region long - range and memory effects take place .",
    "as already discussed , in the solar core collective effects have time scales comparable to the average time between collisions ( _ e.g. _ , compare the inverse plasma frequency with the average collision time @xmath102 ) and it is not possible a description that separates the collective and the individual degrees of freedom .",
    "a rigorous microscopic approach would imply the resolution of the dynamical equations of motion with a hamiltonian that explicitly contains collective and individual degrees of freedom and their mutual interactions .",

    "this experiment has measured also the energy spectrum of the boron neutrinos confirming the expected shape apart for same discrepancy for energies greater than about 14  mev , discrepancy that could be interpreted as evidence for oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the other two kinds of ( radiochemical ) experiments  @xcite have lower thresholds and , since they do not have energy information , measure a combination of several neutrino fluxes .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the ssm flux predictions have ranges of variability , whose magnitudes mostly depend on their importance in the energy production mechanism .",
    "the @xmath1 flux is almost independent of the ssm ( a few percent uncertainty ) , the @xmath166be is fairly stable ( about 10% uncertainty ) , while the boron flux , which is produced in a marginal chain of the energy production , has a larger ( more than 30% ) uncertainty . the ranges of predictions of the ssm fluxes come mainly from the experimental / theoretical uncertainties in the input parameters ( nuclear cross sections , photon opacities and initial contents ) .",
    "the have been numerous attempts of reconciling solar models and neutrinos experiments by allowing all theoretical inputs to vary within and also considerably outside their uncertainties .",
    "others have assumed arbitrary changes of the internal structure of the models ( scaling of the temperature profile , fast element mixing , etc . ) .",
    "this approach to the snp is called the `` astrophysical solution '' ( references could be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the most radical _ astrophysical solution _ consists in leaving the neutrino fluxes as free parameters ( no solar model ) with the only constraint that the produced energy should match the solar luminosity . nevertheless , there remains a discrepancy at about the 34  @xmath167 level ( the central predictions of the ssm are more than @xmath168 s from the experimental results )  @xcite .      a different velocity distribution yields a different @xmath169 , as discussed in sec .",

    "( [ sigmas ] ) .",
    "therefore , allowing a modified velocity distribution does not span a different set of neutrino fluxes than the arbitrary variation of all the astrophysical factors .",
    "in particular , one can not hope to achieve a better agreement with the data than the one achieved by leaving the fluxes themselves as free parameters .    in practice , however , arbitrary large variations of the astrophysical factors contrast with our theoretical understanding of the nuclear reactions and often with experimental measurements . allowing generous , but not arbitrary ,",
    "ranges for the input parameters , implies a much more restricted values of the possible neutrino fluxes .    on the contrary",
    ", small changes of the velocity distribution can give huge changes of @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , changing the velocity distribution has several motivations .",
    "( 1 ) when one is able to calculated the velocity distribution from the microscopic physics , it gives a predictions for @xmath169 .",
    "( 2 ) even when one can only estimate the size of the deviation , it gives a physical mechanism to justify large and correlated changes of @xmath169 .",
    "( 3 ) in any case , a given uncertainty in form of the distribution yields calculable greater ranges of solar model predictions compared to the ones of the ssm , which assumes the distribution function known to high accuracy .",
    "changing @xmath169 for the @xmath136th reaction will affect the whole solar model and , in general , all fluxes will change .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ asyratedel ] ) as a general parameterization of the rate change for small deviations from the standard distribution .",
    "the effects of modifying the rates on the fluxes can be estimated by using the power - law dependences @xmath170 for the fluxes @xmath171 @xmath166be , @xmath164b , @xmath172n and @xmath173o , and using the solar luminosity constraint  @xcite to determine the @xmath1 flux , @xmath174 , and keeping fixed the ratio @xmath175 .",
    "the exponents @xmath176 ( see table  [ table2 ] ) have been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is also discussed why solar models depend only on the combination @xmath177 and why it is a good approximation to keep the ratio @xmath178 constant .",
    "a direct microscopic calculation would determine @xmath97 that could be different for every reaction ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "the energy distribution can be influenced by the specific properties of the ion ( charge and mass ) and by the different conditions of the environment in those parts of the sun where each of the reactions mostly takes place .",
    "however , such a direct calculation is not simple and it does not exist for the solar interior .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of estimating the effect of nonstandard distributions , we consider two simple models and consider @xmath97 ( s ) as free parameter(s ) .",
    "the first model assumes the same deviation @xmath97 for all distributions , the second model assumes that only the @xmath180be and @xmath35he + @xmath181he relative energy distributions are nonstandard and introduces @xmath182 and @xmath183 to parameterize their deviations .    in the first case ,",

    "( [ dflux ] ) that @xmath184 where @xmath185 are reported in table  [ table2 ] .",

    "@xcite as reference model and the experimental results up to the end of 1997 ( see table  [ table3 ] ) , we obtain the best fit for @xmath186 with a @xmath187 .    in the second case",

    "however , we have shown that deviations from standard statistics corresponding to values of @xmath97 of about 1% can change the neutrino fluxes of factors comparable to those that constitute the snp .",
    "perhaps , the actual values of the neutrino fluxes coming out of the sun could result from the interplay of several mechanisms that are disregarded in the standard picture  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the uncertainties of the neutrino fluxes are considerably underestimated by not considering the possibility of non - extensive distributions .",
    "helioseismology provides very detailed and precise information on the solar structure .",
    "the extremely precise measurements of a tremendous number of frequencies give the possibility of extracting values of the sound speed even near the solar core where the energy is generated .",
    "in addition , several properties of the convective envelope are accurately determined .",
    "it is important to verify that nonstandard distributions do not contrast with such data .",
    "this study has been done for the velocity distribution of proton  @xcite : if @xmath97 is within with following limits @xmath196 there is no incompatibility between helioseismic data and nonstandard statistics .",
    "as we have seen , even such small values of @xmath97 have very important consequences for the neutrino fluxes ; in addition , this limit does not automatically apply to the distribution of other ions .",
    "the solar core , where its energy is produced , is a weakly nonideal plasma .",
    "many approaches are possible to such systems .",
    "the standard debye - hckel theory is very successful , but it is not sufficient to give an accurate description when one needs to calculate the energy ( velocity ) distribution function to a high accuracy .",
    "we have tried several new approaches to this complex problem .",
    "in particular , we have considered corrections to the fokker - plank equations , the known stochastic distribution of electric microfields , and memory effects arising from the interaction of individual and collective variables .",
    "all our attempts indicate that the velocity distribution of ions in the plasma could be different from the maxwellian one , and should be well described by a tsallis distribution slightly nonextensive ( @xmath197 ) .      however , even such small deviations of the energy distribution produce dramatic effects on those nuclear rates whose main contributions come from the high - energy tail of the distribution , as it is best exemplified by fig .",
