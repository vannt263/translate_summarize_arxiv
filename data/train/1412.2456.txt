    "the purpose of this work is to study the propagation of acoustic waves in the presence of a uniform flow , driven by spatially homogeneous gaussian noise source . in the absence of the mean flow",
    ", the acoustic problem can be constructed by the classical wave equation .",
    "the wave equation with a gaussian noise has been studied by many articles , for example @xcite . especially , dalang and frangos proved hlder continuity of the solution to stochastic wave equation in two spatial dimensions by presenting a necessary and sufficient condition for a real - valued stochastic process ( @xcite ) .    the linearized euler equations model aeroacoustic problems in the presence of a uniform flow .",
    "the equations support acoustic waves , which propagates with the speed of sound relative to the mean flow , and vorticity and entropy waves , which travels with the mean flow .",
    "the entropy waves can be ignored in an inviscid , homogeneous fluid which does not conduct heat .",
    "for such a mean flow , the linearized euler equations reduce into a convected wave equation for the pressure field .",
    "the presence of a mean flow makes the mathematical treatment of the problem much more difficult , mainly due to the acoustic waves whose phase and group velocities have opposite signs @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the convective wave equation in two space dimension .",
    "unfortunately , a space - time white noise @xmath0 is not adapted to wave problem with two dimensions ( refer to @xcite for details ) . in this reason , authors of @xcite studied stochastic wave equation under a spatially homogeneous gaussian noise .",
    "similarly , we consider the convective wave equation driven by gaussian noise @xmath1 as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the formal derivative of gaussian random field @xmath1 whose covariance function is given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a mach vector .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is a continuous function , @xmath7 , which holds the condition , @xmath8 ( refer to @xcite for details ) .",

    "note that the problem ( [ spde1 ] ) is reduced to the wave equation considered by @xcite ( @xmath14 ) . here , we use a notation @xmath15 for our convenience . the green function of ( [ spde1 ] ) in the case of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dirac delta function is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
