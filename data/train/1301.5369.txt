    "in other works , this process is typically replaced by simultaneous fitting of all tb parameters to apw band structures and total energies , however , in our work we seek better physical insight into the spin - orbit coupling phenomena and transferability between different structures rather than precise agreement of tb and _ ab initio _ results .",
    "we found that the net spin magnetic moment increases with small enhancement of the stoner parameters and with shifting of the pt @xmath36-state on - site energy towards the @xmath37-states as expected .",
    "remarkably , the mae obtained for a narrow range of these parameters , where the net spin magnetic moment and dos reached the best agreement with the _ ab initio _ predictions , is in quantitative agreement with _",

    "such success motivates future investigations of the transferability of the model in other compounds or multilayers . at the same time our tb model is well suited for incorporation of the equilibrium green s function framework to calculate relativistic magnetotransport phenomena in structures containing the magnetic compounds or multilayers .",
