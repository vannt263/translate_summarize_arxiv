    "in recent years there has been a revolution in our understanding of black holes in globular clusters . until the launches of chandra and xmm - newton , it had become widely , if not universally , accepted lore that stellar mass black holes could not exist in significant numbers in globular clusters .",
    "spitzer ( 1969 ) considered a hypothetical star cluster whose stars had only two possible masses .",
    "he found that given a large mass ratio between the two components and a significant fraction of the stars in the more massive component , an instability would lead to severe mass segregation , such that the heavier stars would form a sub - cluster which would not be affected by the outer main cluster .",
    "this sub - cluster can then evaporate itself dynamically on a timescale much less than the hubble time . the combination of theoretical work , plus the lack of observational evidence for stellar mass black holes in milky way globular clusters led to the suggestion that globular clusters should not , and did not , contain substantial populations of black holes .",
    "more recent theoretical work , however , has shown that substantial fractions of black holes can be retained in globular clusters ( mackey et al .",
    "2007 ; moody & sigurdsson 2009 ) .",
    "the finding that some black holes are retained should not be surprising given that the spitzer instability requires that the ratio of the total mass in the heavy component to the total mass in the light component exceeds a critical value that is a function of the ratio of the masses ; i.e. once a certain number of black holes are ejected , the spitzer instability criterion is no longer satisfied .    in the early chandra observations of elliptical galaxies ,",
    "many sources were found with luminosities exceeding the eddington luminosity of a single neutron star ( e.g. sarazin et al .",
    "2000 ; angelini et al 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , there remained in those cases the possibility that the x - ray sources were not single black holes , but rather superpositions of several bright neutron stars ; variability is needed to distinguish between the two possibilities ( kalogera et al .",
    "the discovery of strong variability from the @xmath1 ergs / sec source , xmmu  122939.7 + 075333 in ngc  4472 , by maccarone et al .",
    "( 2007 ) confirmed that , in at least one case , a source could not be explained as a superposition of eddington - limited neutron stars , and thus had to be a black hole , or a highly beamed neutron star . the more recent discoveries of strong , broad [ o iii ] emission lines ( zepf et al .",
    "2007;2008 ) from this system ruled out the possibilities of substantial beaming ( since the [ o iii ] forbidden line emission , must come from an optically thin and hence isotropically emitting region ",
    "see e.g gnedin et al .",
    "this result thus strongly supports a scenario with a @xmath2 system , in order to drive the strong outflows implied by the optical emission lines .",
    "the system is therefore likely to host a a stellar mass black hole accretor , rather than an intermediate mass black hole .",
    "recently , at least two other cases for black holes in globular clusters have been identified ( brassington et al .",
    "2010 ; shih et al .",
    ", submitted to apj ) .",
    "brassington et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found evidence for a source in ngc  3379 near the eddington luminosity for a stellar mass black hole , which varied by about 30% ( with a @xmath3 larger than the eddington luminosity for a neutron star ) , and with x - ray spectra consistent with the expectations for a stellar mass black hole in that luminosity range .",
    "shih et al . ( 2010 ) report a more complicated pattern of source behavior  a source in ngc  1399 which has several epochs near or slightly above @xmath4 ergs / sec , and variability of factors of several within an observation and a factor of @xmath5 on timescales of years . in neither case",
    "is there any evidence put forth to support the idea that these might be intermediate mass black holes .",
    "a different type of case has also been made for another black hole in a globular cluster in ngc  1399 on the basis of a high ( @xmath6 ergs / sec ) x - ray luminosity and strong [ o iii ] and [ n ii ] emission lines ( irwin et al . 2010 ) . while irwin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argued for an interpretation favoring an intermediate mass black hole based on the soft x - ray spectrum and high luminosity , we note that there are alternative accretion disc models in which such a soft spectrum at a high luminosity can result from a mildly super - eddington accretion flow ( e.g. soria et al . 2007 ; gladstone et al . 2009 ) .",
    "recently , there has also been a discovery of a very strong intermediate mass black hole candidate in the galaxy eso243 - 49 , which has an extremely high luminosity , of about @xmath7 ergs / sec ( farrell et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the source also shows spectral state transitions at about @xmath8 ergs / sec ( godet et al . 2009 ) , which imply a black hole mass of about @xmath9 if they occur at the typical 2% of the eddington luminosity ( maccarone 2003 ) .",
    "recently , the source has been found to have an optical counterpart whose flux is consistent with expectations of a bright globular cluster in eso  243 - 49 ( soria et al .",
    "2010 ) , but the identification of the optical counterpart as a globular cluster remains highly insecure for the time being .",
    "we thus mention this source for completeness , but do not include it in any of the analysis of the properties of globular clusters hosting black hole candidates . in this paper , we present evidence for a fourth variability - confirmed globular cluster black hole ( and fifth strong candidate ) , and discuss the properties of the global sample of strong globular cluster black hole candidates found to date .",
    "chandra has observed ngc  4472 three times , and there exists a fourth field not aimed at ngc  4472 itself , but which includes our source of interest .",
    "two of the observations of ngc  4472 were taken in 2000 , one with acis - i on 19 march 2000 , and the other with acis - s on 12 june 2000 .",
    "the most recent was taken on 27 february 2010 .",
    "the observation in which our source appears , but which was not an observation of ngc  4472 was taken 23 february 2008 as part of the amuse - virgo project ( see e.g. gallo et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we produced a catalog of x - ray sources using wavdetect ( freeman et al .",
    "2002 ) after processing the data to remove high background time intervals .",
    "we then used topcat to combine the catalog of x - ray sources produced from this observation with both the catalog from the previous chandra observations of ngc  4472 discussed in kundu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and published in maccarone et al .",
    "( 2003  mkz03 ) and the optical catalog of globular clusters published in mkz03 .",
    "we searched the list of sources that matched globular clusters in the optical catalog for sources with luminosities above @xmath10 ergs / sec .",
    "we then checked these sources for variability between the two epochs of long chandra integrations .",
    "we identified one new variable source associated with globular cluster 28 of the catalog of mkz03 .",
    "this source , located at 12h29m41.0s + 7@xmath115744  , about 2.7 from the center of ngc  4472 , was detected in 2001 by chandra , but we did not report on its in kmz02 or mkz03 because the source fell on the acis - s2 chip , and those papers reported only sources on acis - s3 .",
    "we find a separation of 0.5  between the x - ray position from the 2010 observations and the optical position from mkz03 .",
    "we test the chance superposition probability by making shifts to the positions of the x - ray sources by small amounts , the determining the number of matches closer than 0.65  , the separation beyond which kundu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found there were few additional matches , indicating that most of the additional matches were likely to be chance superpositions .",
    "we restrict our estimate of the number of false matches to the region between 2.2 and 3.2 arcminutes from the center of the galaxy in order to ensure that the space density of optical clusters in the region searched is similar to that around cxou  1229410 + 075744 , which is located 2.7 from the center of ngc  4472 . within this region , there are 23 x - ray sources , and 343 optical clusters .",
    "formally , the region subtends a solid angle of about 61000 square arcseconds , but about 1/5 of the region was not covered with the hst observations used for the comparisons .",
    "regions matching an optical cluster within 0.65  thus subtend about 1% of the region .",
    "we thus estimate a 1% chance superposition probability for a given x - ray source with an optical globular cluster ( even considering a 1  matching radius would give a less than 3% probabilty of a chance superposition ) . the particular cluster with which this x - ray source matches is among the brightest 10% of the clusters in ngc  4472 , which can be taken as additional support of the idea that the match is genuine , albeit in an _ a posteriori _ manner that is difficult to quantify .      having identified a strong black hole candidate , we then produced x - ray spectra of the source using the specextract tool and light curves of the source using the dmextract tool on the two deep acis - s observations .",
    "the spectra were extracted with an 8 pixel radius , and an offset background region of 20 pixel radius .",
    "the channels in the source spectrum were then binned in groups of 20 or more photons .",
    "spectral fitting was done in xspec 12.5.1 ( see arnaud 1996 for a description of an earlier version of xspec ) .",
    "rebinned channels including photons below 0.5 kev and above 8 kev are ignored , because the response matrix for chandra is better calibrated within this energy range than outside of it .",
    "we report the 1@xmath12 errors on source parameters .    in observation 321 , taken 12 june 2000 ,",
    "the cluster s x - ray spectrum was well fitted ( @xmath13 ) with a disk blackbody model with foreground neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 kev and normalization in xspec of 2.0@xmath17 , corresponding to a best - fitting inner disk radius of 72 km assuming a face - on disk and no spectral hardening correction ( mitsuda et al .",
    "the source flux from 0.5 - 8.0 kev is 2.2@xmath18 ergs/@xmath19/sec .",
    "the best fitting value corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath20 ergs / sec using a distance of 16 mpc to ngc  4472 , based on the distance to the virgo cluster in which it is contained ( macri et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in observation 11274 , taken on 27 february 2010",
    ", the source spectrum was well fitted ( i.e. @xmath21=10.5/19 ) with @xmath22 kev and normalization in xspec of 9.2@xmath23 , corresponding to a best fitting inner disk radius of 34 km assuming a face - on disk and no spectral hardening correction .",
    "the source flux from 0.5 - 8.0 kev is 9.2@xmath24 ergs/@xmath19/sec .",
    "the best fitting value corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath25 ergs / sec .",
    "the temperatures of the disk are thus different at nearly the @xmath26 level , and both spectra are consistent with standard phenomenology that the inner disk radius will vary little in high / soft states .",
    "the luminosity difference is significant at more than @xmath27 , and the @xmath26 lower limit to the luminosity difference is about @xmath10 ergs / sec , above the eddington luminosity for a single neutron star .",
    "the chandra spectra are shown in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "we have also tried to fit power law models to the data . for observation 321 , a power law model with the foreground",
    "@xmath28 gives an acceptable fit , with @xmath29 , with a power law index of @xmath30 , and the 1-@xmath12 confidence interval for the flux ranging from 2.3 - 3.4@xmath31 ergs / sec/@xmath19 .",
    "the spectral shape is thus marginally consistent with expectations for a low / hard state , but the luminosity is well above the few percent of the eddington luminosity in which hard states are typically found ( maccarone 2003 ) .",
    "we thus favor the diskbb model fit as providing parameter values more likely to be indicative of the real physical state of the system , but we do note that the spectral fits do not distinguish between the two scenarios . for observation 11274 , a power law model with the foreground",
    "@xmath28 is formally a good fit , with @xmath32 , but with a spectral index of @xmath33 , considerably harder than is ever seen in a low hard state from a galactic black hole x - ray binary .",
    "since in the former case , the power law model provides a poor fit to the data , and in the latter case , the best fitting value of the power law index lies outside the range expected from phenomenology , there is a strong case to be made that the data are genuinely better explained with a strong thermal component than a pure power law spectrum .",
    "the two other chandra observations of this field of view , observation 322 ( made 19 march 2000 ) , and observation 8095 ( made 23 february 2008 ) , have much shorter integration times .",
    "for cxou  1229410 + 075744 , observation 322 yields 40 counts in 10 kiloseconds with acis - i , and observation 8095 yields 24 counts in 5 kiloseconds with acis - s .",
    "both observations yield flux levels of @xmath345 @xmath35 ergs / sec/@xmath19 . because there are not enough counts for detailed spectral fitting ,",
    "there is a considerable uncertainty on the counts - to - energy conversion .",
    "the poisson errors are also substantial . as a result , it is difficult to determine whether the flux levels during the two short observations were higher or lower than those during the longer observations .",
    "the x - ray detections and upper limits are summarized in table [ xrays ] .",
    "two deep xmm - newton observations of this source have been made as well .",
    "however , this source is close enough to the center of ngc  4472 that the diffuse gas emission significantly affects xmm s sensitivity .",
    "the 2xmm catalog ( watson et al . 2009 ) reports a source 8  away from cxou  1229410 + 075744 , with a positional error of 4.47  at 12h29m40.49s , @xmath36m47.1s on 5 june 2002 .",
    "the source is given a quality flag ( the sum_flag parameter value ) of 4 , indicating that it is located within a region where spurious detections are likely , and that the source itself may be a spurious source .",
    "formally , @xmath27 upper limits can be obtained from the flix tool , using data corresponding to the 2xmmi - dr3 data release .",
    "flix finds that the source was no brighter than about @xmath37 ergs / sec on 5 june 2002 , and @xmath38 ergs / sec on 1 january 2004 .",
    "while the upper limits from flix appear to indicate that the source faded sometime after 2001 , and re - brightened sometime between 2004 and 2008 , we have also looked at the aperture photometry from the flix tool .",
    "we set the extraction region to 5  , in order to limit the effects of confusion from nearby gas emission and other point sources .",
    "we find that in the obseravations made on 1 january 2004 , all three xmm instruments show a flux more than @xmath39 above background in the 0.2 - 12 kev band , with the most sensitive pn detection above @xmath40 .",
    "the flux within 5  is @xmath41 ergs / sec in the epic - pn , @xmath42 ergs / sec in mos1 , and @xmath43 ergs / sec in mos2 .",
    "the encircled energy fraction at 5  is about 40% . taking the aperture photometry at face value",
    ", we estimate that the source was at about @xmath44 ergs / sec .",
    "the aperture photometry from flix for the 5 june 2002 observation gives a flux level similar to that in the 1 january 2004 observation , but the source was only about @xmath45 above the background on 5 june 2002 .",
    "we tentatively trust the aperture photometry results , in part because they indicate a more physically likely scenario - that the source did not change sharply in luminosity twice in less than a decade - but prefer a cautious approach regarding any conclusion sensitive to the results of the xmm analysis .",
    ".a summary of the chandra observations of cxou  j1229410 + 075744 .",
    "because xmm s angular resolution causes problems for sources this close to the center of the galaxy , and the results of the xmm analysis are ambiguous , we present the xmm results only in the text and not in the table .",
    "the two luminosities in the shorter chandra observations are uncertain by a factor of @xmath46 because the integrations were not long enough to allow for reliable spectral fitting , leaving the counts - to - energy conversion factor uncertain . [",
