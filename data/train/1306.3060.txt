    "dwarf stars with subsolar metallicity are bluer than solar abundance dwarfs or main - sequence stars of the equivalence mass .",
    "they lie below the main sequence in the hertzsprung  russell diagram and appear less luminous than main - sequence stars .",
    "these objects were thus called  subdwarfs \" by @xcite .",
    "evolving subdwarfs are referred to as cool subdwarfs to provide distinction from hot subdwarfs , a different class of objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "cool dwarfs and cool subdwarfs are observationally and kinematically distinct , and were separated into population i and ii categories , respectively by @xcite .",
    "population i and ii are associated with the galactic disc and spheroid respectively .",
    "@xcite find that the old , high - velocity population ii stars were also metal deficient .",
    "red dwarfs are low - mass and relatively cool stars on the main sequence with spectral types of late - type k and m , masses between @xmath0 0.6 and @xmath0 0.08 @xmath3 , and surface effective temperatures between @xmath0 4000 and @xmath4 2300 k @xcite .",
    "red dwarfs are the most common type of star both in the milky way @xcite and other galaxies @xcite .",
    "the spectra of red dwarfs are dominated by molecular absorption bands of metal oxides and hydrides .",
    "tio and cah near 7000   are the most prominent bands @xcite .",
    "red subdwarfs ( rsds ) are the subsolar counterparts of red dwarfs by chemical abundance .",
    "rsds are significantly rarer than red dwarfs .",
    "the kapteyn s star ( sdm1 type ) is the only cool subdwarf among the sample of 8 pc within the sun which contains more than 244 known stars and brown dwarfs , including 157 m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the known sample of late - type m subdwarfs is significantly smaller than that of early - type m subdwarfs because they are fainter and have lower space density according to the halo mass function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "late - type m subdwarfs have the most complex stellar atmospheres because they are ultracool and have large - scale variation of chemical abundance and gravity .    although rsds are less luminous than f , g and mid - k subdwarfs , they are numerous and have more notable spectral features caused by chemical abundance and gravity , thus they are better targets for observational and theoretical studies .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish f , g and mid - k subdwarfs from normal dwarf stars of the same spectral type using their optical spectra because they are featureless .",
    "dwarfs and subdwarfs with spectral types of late - type k and m , however , have a number of very different spectral features .",
    "model atmospheres also suggest that optical spectra of m subdwarfs are dramatically affected by metallicity variations .",
    "it is thus possible to use low - resolution spectroscopy for exploring effective temperature , metallicity and gravity effects on the spectra of these cool objects @xcite .",
    "classification and characterization of m subdwarfs is a rapidly evolving field @xcite .",
    "m subdwarfs are classified into three metal classes : subdwarf ( sdm ) , extreme subdwarf ( esdm ) and ultra subdwarf ( usdm ) based on the ratio of tio to cah indices @xcite .",
    "cah and tio indices are easy to measure and sensitive to temperature and metallicity .",
    "however , @xcite found that the cah and tio indices are affected in complicated ways by combinations of temperatures , metallicities and gravities of rsds .",
    "model spectra show that the tio5 index is more sensitive to metallicity while the cah2 and cah3 indices are more sensitive to gravity .",
    "this suggests that the effect of gravity , which was previously ignored , should be considered in the classification of m subdwarfs .",
    "an ideal testbed for the impact of gravity on spectra of m subdwarfs is binary systems with two m subdwarfs which share the same age and metallicity . with the same effect on spectra from metallicity , it is possible to measure the difference of gravity on the broad indices of cah2 , cah3 and tio5 .",
    "m subdwarfs in binary systems are the key for both model calibration , and spectral classification and characterization .",
    "discovery of a sample of rsd binary systems is therefore crucial . in this paper",
    "we present the discovery of 45 rsd binary systems from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , * ? ? ?",
    "at least one companion in each system is confirmed as an rsd with sdss spectra .",
    "the selection and classification processes of our rsd sample are presented in section  [ sample ] .",
    "the identification of rsd binary systems is presented in section [ sbinary ] .",
    "section  [ snote ] presents further discussion of rsd binary systems of particular interests .",
    "summary and conclusions is described in section  [ ssummary ] .",
    "the eighth data release ( dr8 ) of sdss includes 14555 deg@xmath5 of imaging data , and 9274 deg@xmath5 of spectroscopic data .",
    "there are over 1.84 million spectra in total , including 0.6 million stars , 0.13 million quasars and 0.95 million galaxies @xcite .",
    "the sdss dr8 also includes proper motions ( pms ) for objects derived by combining sdss astrometry with usno - b positions , re - calibrated against sdss .",
    "the errors of pms are typically less than 10 mas@xmath6yr@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "band reduced pms @xmath8 and @xmath9 colour of our pm selected objects .",
    "symbols in the figure are black down - pointing triangles : m dwarfs ; green squares : sdms ; red circles : esdms ; blue up - pointing triangles : usdms ; grey left - pointing triangles : wds . ]",
    "we selected our candidates using sdss casjobs by combining the spectroscopic and pm catalogues .",
    "we required pm greater than 100 mas@xmath6yr@xmath7 .",
    "no photometric criteria were applied but spectral observations for red dwarfs in sdss is limited to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "most of rsds in sdss spectroscopic data base are at distances of 200 @xmath0 400 pc .",
    "objects with tangential velocity of 200 km s@xmath7 at a distance of 400 pc ( or 100 km s@xmath7 and 200 pc ) will have pms higher than 100 mas@xmath6yr@xmath7 .",
    "a pm cut of 100 mas@xmath6yr@xmath7 allows a good balance in order to select most late - type k , early - type m and almost all mid - late type m subdwarfs in the combined sdss pm + spectroscopic catalogues while minimizing the contamination by dwarf stars . since not all spectra in dr7 @xcite",
    "are reproduced in dr8 we applied our search to both data releases finding 7499 and 8445 spectra respectively .",
    "there were 9146 spectra in total for 8236 objects ( some objects had more than one spectrum ) .",
    "sdss spectra were reduced and classified with the idlspec2d code by sdss @xcite . for 8236 objects in our sample ,",
    "5687 were classified as stars , 1558 as galaxies and 348 as qsos , 643 of them were not classified .",
    "not all objects in the sample are classified by sdss .",
    "rsds are generally classified as stars or galaxies in some cases .    to pick out and classify rsds in our sample properly we used a k and m subdwarf classification code developed by @xcite .",
    "we ran the code on the spectra of all 8236 objects to identify subdwarfs and assign their spectral types .",
    "the code classified objects into nine groups : dm ( 2455 ) , dk ( 80 ) , sdm ( 689 ) , sdk ( 326 ) , esdm ( 483 ) , esdk ( 189 ) , usdm ( 256 ) , usdk ( 189 ) , and unclassified ( 3442 ) .",
    "we found many objects , originally classified as galaxies by sdss , that were re - classified as sdk , esdk or usdk .",
    "we inspected the spectra by eye in each group to ensure that the correct classification was applied in each case .",
    "we found 2004 galaxies with false pms were selected into our sample : 383 of them were classified as stars ( mostly late - type k subdwarfs ) .",
    "we found that 463 late - type k subdwarfs and 1363 m subdwarfs survived the eyeball check .",
    "54 objects were classified as sdm but removed from our subdwarf sample because they do not have typical halo kinematics .",
    "[ hr ] shows reduced pms and @xmath9 colour of these objects .",
    "three sequences from left to right show the location of white dwarfs ( wds ) , m subdwarfs and m dwarfs .",
    "[ ugrz ] shows two colour diagrams of @xmath12 versus @xmath9 and @xmath12 versus @xmath9 of the sample .",
    "the wd sample will be discussed in a future paper ."
