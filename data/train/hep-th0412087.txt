    "[ intro ]    the dynamics of charged particles in a constant electromagnetic background has been a focus of considerable theoretical interest since the early days of quantum field theory . to recall just two important contributions , euler and heisenberg  @xcite computed the one - loop qed effective action by integrating out fermion fields , and later schwinger  @xcite derived the probability of pair creation in a constant electric field , focusing on the absorptive part of the one - loop calculation ( see  @xcite for a recent review and a detailed list of references ) .",
    "a similar problem can be studied in string theory , and also in this context it has provided several important insights .",
    "open strings , in particular , represent a natural generalization of charged particles since they couple , through their endpoints , to a gauge field .",
    "bachas and porrati  @xcite generalized schwinger s computation to the case of open ( super)strings , and later the same technique was applied to study the @xmath0-dual case of moving d - branes  @xcite and to a finite temperature environment  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the case of open bosonic strings and we will study the multiloop partition function in the presence of a constant yang - mills field strength @xmath1",
    ". we will then use the string formula in the low - energy limit to recover the euler - heisenberg effective action at one and two loops , considering specifically the coupling of the gauge field to adjoint scalars . even for the bosonic string",
    ", the explicit formulation of this partition function requires some new input , beyond the known results of multiloop perturbative string theory . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the open string diagram is represented as usual by a riemann surface with @xmath2 boundaries , however the presence of an external field @xmath1 introduces twisted boundary conditions along some of the boundaries . as a consequence ,",
    "the basic geometric building blocks of the string amplitude , such as the determinant of the laplace operator on the riemann surface , are deformed by @xmath1 .",
    "the necessary ingredients to derive the multiloop partition function for charged open strings were assembled in  @xcite , developing earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "we note also that twisted boundary conditions in the open string channel correspond to cuts along homology cycles for closed strings .",
    "this suggests that the present formalism might have broader applications : the appearence of cuts on the riemann surface representing a string amplitude , in fact , is a generic feature of the ramond - neuveu - schwarz formalism .",
    "the ramond sector of the superstring , for instance , has a square - root cut for fermion fields , while closed strings on orbifolds have @xmath3-fold cuts in the twisted sector .",
    "thus it is not surprising to see the same mathematical objects appearing in different contexts ( compare , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "even if the mathematical formulation of the string effective action is written in the language of two - dimensional riemannian geometry , its physical content is very close to the quantum field theory counterpart .",
    "in fact it is expected , and we will explicitly show , that the two results should be precisely connected in the field theory limit , when the typical length of the open string @xmath4 is sent to zero .    the idea to construct a precise mapping between the low energy behaviour of string theory and the corresponding field theory feynman diagrams is very old  @xcite , and was applied to effective actions in  @xcite ; it received renewed interest when it was noted  @xcite that the organization of tree - level gluon amplitudes suggested by string theory is an efficient computational tool for high energy processes in qcd .",
    "subsequently , the methods to perform the field theory limit of string amplitudes at loop level were pioneered by bern and kosower  @xcite , who studied one - loop amplitudes in gauge theories .",
    "string - inspired techniques were then used to obtain novel results , relevant to collider phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "later , the correspondence between string diagrams and ordinary feynman diagrams was made more precise , and it was shown that one - loop yang - mills amplitudes could be recovered from open bosonic string theory on a diagram by diagram basis  @xcite , and even completely off - shell  @xcite .",
    "while at one loop these techniques have been very successful for yang - mills theory , and have also been applied to gravity  @xcite , extension to two loops for gauge bosons has proven difficult  @xcite .",
    "it has however been shown that one can tune the field theory limit of bosonic strings to reproduce feynman diagrams in scalar theories , at one and two loops  @xcite , and with both cubic and quartic vertices  @xcite .    in the second part of this paper",
    "we will make use some of these techniques to study the low energy regime of the charged string partition function at one and two loops .",
    "we will take the simplest field theory limit  @xcite , isolating the contribution of the string ground state ( the tachyon ) .",
    "as expected , the euler - heisenberg effective action will arise from the string formula in the scaling limit in which the dimensionful physical gauge field is kept constant as @xmath5 .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section  [ bospart ]",
    "we begin by recalling the computation of vacuum diagrams for ordinary bosonic strings , and then move on to study the modifications due to the presence of a constant gauge field strength .",
    "the crucial point is that when @xmath1 is constant the world - sheet equations of motion of the string are unchanged and only the boundary conditions are modified .",
    "a powerful method to take into account these twisted boundary conditions is the boundary state formalism , which describes _ closed _ strings propagating between the various boundaries . to get our final result",
    ", we must then perform the modular transformation exchanging @xmath6 and @xmath7 homology cycles , leading to an expression for the amplitude in the open string channel , as described pictorially in fig .",
    "[ branes ] . in order",
    "to be self - contained and to keep track of all normalizations , we give in section  [ field ] the derivation of the two - loop euler - heisenberg effective action in the appropriate field theory . finally , in section  [ low ] we perform the field theory limit described in  @xcite on the @xmath8 string partition function , and we show that it precisly reproduces the results of section  [ field ] .",
    "the final section discusses further applications of our results and some possible developments .",
    "[ bospart ]      the partition function of closed bosonic string theory at @xmath9 and @xmath10 loops was first derived in  @xcite , using previous mathematical results on modular forms .",
    "this derivation , however , is not directly generalizable beyond genus @xmath11 . in fact , only for @xmath12 one can choose to parametrize the moduli space of inequivalent riemann surfaces by using the elements of the period matrix @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , as independent parameters .",
    "an alternative derivation of the bosonic partition function was presented in  @xcite , where the operator approach was used .",
    "the final expression is automatically written in the schottky parametrization of the riemann surface , so that it is valid for any @xmath15 , in a framework which however has the drawback of blurring the modular properties of the results .    as usual",
    ", one can derive the open string partition function from the closed string result by requiring that the period matrix be compatible with the involution  @xcite that squeezes a closed genus-@xmath15 surface into an open one . in our case",
    "we can obtain the disk with @xmath15 holes by restricting the period matrix to be purely imaginary . in the schottky parametrization",
    "the genus-@xmath15 partition function for the open bosonic string , with neumann boundary conditions , is given by z ( g ) & = & _ = 1^g ^- + & & _   .",
    "[ scg ] here @xmath16 is the space - time dimension , @xmath17 for the ordinary bosonic string .",
    "moduli space is parametrized by the multipliers @xmath18 and by the fixed points @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the @xmath15 projective transformations forming the basis for the schottky group at genus @xmath15 .",
    "we refer to the appendices of  @xcite for a short explanation of the schottky parametrization and for all the conventions and notations we use in this regard . here",
    "we only note that the primed product in is over primary classes of the schottky group , characterized by elements with multipliers @xmath21 .",
    "the factor @xmath22 accounts for the volume of the projective group which leaves the measure invariant , corresponding to the freedom to fix arbitrarily three fixed points . at two loops",
    ", we will take advantage of this freedom by setting @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "note that the three moduli appearing in for @xmath26 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) are related to the elements of the period matrix .",

    ", one can check that both of them follow from the same ` first principles ' formula  @xcite , z(g ) = _ a = 1 ^ 3 g - 3 d m_a det ( ^ ) ^- d/2 z_1 ^ - d  , [ fp ] which can be derived directly from polyakov path integral . here",
