    "the investigation of optical pulses and of modulated periodical waves in wave guide structures as fibers and planar waveguides is connected with the additional requirements to the optical property of the materials .",
    "one standard way for confinement the optical beams and pulses is by variation of the linear or nonlinear refractive index in plane , which is transverse to the propagation direction . in an isotropic",
    "dispersive media the refractive index depends only on the frequency , the group velocity depends on the chromatic dispersion and the wave guide modes can not be introduced in linear regime of propagation .",
    "to provide one correct analysis in this case we need to get in mind also the different spatial size of the optical pulses .",
    "the longitudinal spatial size is determined from the time duration by the relations @xmath0 , where a typical value of the group index @xmath1 in transparency region of pure silica is ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "for example , the typical transverse size of laser pulses is evaluated from @xmath3 @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "while for the longitudinal size of pulses or spatial period of modulated waves , there are mainly two possibilities : a. pulses from nanoseconds up to @xmath7 picoseconds . for such pulses @xmath8 and",
    "their shape is more close to optical filaments .",
    "b. pulses from few picoseconds to @xmath9 femtoseconds . in this case @xmath10 and the pulses look like as optical bullets .",
    "when the transverse and longitudinal part are approximately equal ( case b ) , the ignoring of the second derivative in @xmath11 direction in amplitude equation is not possible .",
    "the propagation of such type of short optical pulses in nonlinear media must be characterized , not only with the equal dimensions in @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 direction , but also with non - stationary optical linear and nonlinear response of the media .",
    "that is why we can expect , that the equations governing the propagation of such type of pulses , like optical bullets , are different from the well known paraxial approximated equations , which describe evolution of nanosecond and picosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "another basic characteristic of the pulses is their polarization .",
    "as it is well known , in the case of plane monochromatic wave , the electromagnetic field is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation . in this case",
    "four stokes parameters , two amplitudes and two phases , connected with the transverse components of the electromagnetic field can be introduced @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to su(2 ) symmetry of propagation of the monochromatic field .",
    "the nanosecond and hundred picosecond optical pulses admit very little spectral bandwidth , and the polarization component in the propagation direction is small in respect to the transverse components . with good approximation",
    "these pulses or modulated waves also can be investigated as polarized in @xmath14 plane .",
    "their spatial form also is more close to the cw wave , as the longitudinal size is hundred times greater , than the transverse size .",
    "in contrast to the case of long pulses , the few ps and femtosecond optical waves are with relatively equal size in @xmath15 direction and admit large spectral width . for them",
    "such coherent su(2 ) tensor can not be introduced .",
    "the experimental results show , that the electric field of sub - picosecond and femtosecond pulses , always contains also third longitudinal component . with the enlargement of the spectral width of the vector field",
    "also the longitudinal component grows ( the component normal to the standard stokes coherent polarization plane ) .",
    "recently carozzi et al .",
    "have shown that for the wave packets higher class of symmetry - su(3 ) exists @xcite . using the presentation of gell - mann of su(3 ) , they prove that five independent parameters , three amplitudes and two phases , define the dynamics of propagation of the vector field .",
    "this corresponds to a three - component vector field .",
    "the above made analysis and the experimental results show that in the investigation of sub - picosecond and femtosecond pulses we must always have in mind the three - component vector character of the electromagnetic field .",
    "an initial investigation of the propagation of the optical pulses was provided in the frame of spatiotemporal scalar evolution equation @xcite .",
    "we found that vector generalization of such spatiotemporal model can be applied to optical pulses or to modulated periodical waves in uv region for dielectrics with strong dispersion .",
    "starting from the maxwell equation for an isotropic , dispersive , nonlinear kerr - type media with no stationary response , we derive the next slowly varying vector amplitude equation @xcite :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the carrying wave number , group velocity , dispersion of the group velocity , and the nonlinear refractive index respectively . with @xmath21",
    "we denote the slowly varying vector amplitude of the electrical field .",
    "the equation ( [ a11 ] ) is written in second approximation to the linear dispersion and in first approximation to the nonlinear dispersion .",
    "the kind of nonlinearity is connected with the fact , that in this paper , as in the previous one @xcite , we investigate only linearly polarized electrical field .",
    "the dependance of the nonlinear polarization from different kinds of polarizations of the electrical field is discussed in the appendix 1 .",
    "we will apply to the basic amplitude equation ( [ a11 ] ) the method of different and equal transverse and longitudinal spatial scales , as it is connected with the natural initial shape of the optical pulses .",
    "this application is one simplification of the multi - scale method , introduced in the nonlinear optics in @xcite and also in the hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "applying a `` moving in time '' ( @xmath22 ) transformation to the vector amplitude equation ( [ a11 ] ) , we obtain :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 .",
    "the estimation of the influence of different terms in equation ( [ mt ] ) can be reached by writing it in dimensionless variables . to make one assessment of the difference between transverse and longitudinal dimension of the pulses we are introducing separately transverse @xmath25 and longitudinal @xmath26 constants . defining the rescaled variables :    @xmath27    and constants :    @xmath28    equation ( [ mt ] )",
    "can be transformed in the following ( the primes and the seconds are not written for clarity ) :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and in the transparency region we use the approximation + @xmath31 .      in the optical region",
    "the wave vector is valued from @xmath32 to @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the typical value of the dispersion parameter in the transparency optical region of dielectrics is from @xmath35 @xmath36 up to @xmath37 @xmath36 in uv region @xcite",
    ". the transfer sizes @xmath38 of laser generated optical pulses or modulated periodical in time waves are valued from @xmath39 to @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "we will investigate laser pulses or modulated periodical waves with time duration or modulation period from few nanoseconds ( @xmath42 @xmath43 ) up to @xmath7 picoseconds ( @xmath44 @xmath43 ) in the transparency region of a nonlinear kerr type media .",
    "the group velocity index in this case is about @xmath45 and using the relations @xmath46 @xmath41 , we find that the dimensionless parameter in front of second derivative in @xmath11 direction and cross - term is very small @xmath47 .",
    "another important relation is that if slowly - varying amplitudes are used @xmath48 . for such typical values of the dispersion @xmath49 , wave vector @xmath17 , time duration @xmath50 and transverse dimension @xmath38 of the optical wave ,",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath51 in front of the dispersion term in equation ( [ tp ] ) is very small @xmath52 .",
    "here we study the cases with power near the critical for self - focusing @xmath53 .",
    "these valuations give us possibility to estimate dimensionless constant in front of the different terms of normalized amplitude equation ( [ tp ] ) for the transparency optical region of a dispersive nonlinear kerr type media :    @xmath54    neglecting the small terms in ( [ tp ] ) we obtain the next amplitude equation :    @xmath55    as it can be expected , the dynamics of such kind of long optical pulses is governed by the well known paraxial approximation .",
    "this equation was introduced initially for optical beam @xcite .",
    "the fact , that with such type of nonlinear paraxial equation it is possible to investigate non - stationary processes is well known also @xcite .",
    "it seems natural the dynamics of propagation of long pulses to be governed by the equation which describes dynamics of optical beam .",
    "the paraxial approximation is applicable even when the relation between the longitudinal and the transverse part is of the order of ten ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the dimensionless coefficient in front of the term with second derivative in z direction and cross - term is of the order of square of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , the term can be neglected and this leads again to the paraxial equation ( [ parax ] ) .",
    "effects of self - steepening due to the first order of the nonlinear dispersion ( second term in equation ( [ tp ] ) ) is not possible as always @xmath59 .",
    "different kind of generalization of equation ( [ parax ] ) in respect to nonlinearities @xcite and multi - component vector fields @xcite was performed .",
    "it is important to point here that the second derivative in @xmath11 direction and the crossed term are neglected from the difference between transverse and longitudinal size ( @xmath60 ) , and not because the slowly varying amplitude is used .",
    "when we investigate the optical pulses with equal transverse and longitudinal size @xmath61 , the second derivative in @xmath11 direction and cross term of the amplitude function are of the same order that the transverse laplassian , and these terms influence considerably on the dynamics of propagation . this important case we will investigate in the next section . when the power of the pulse is less than the critical for self - focusing @xmath62 the diffraction term dominates and the propagation of the optical pulses is governed by the next linear paraxial equation :    @xmath63      in uv region of media with high density as liquids and dielectrics the dispersion @xmath49 increases considerably and can reach the values from @xmath64 @xmath36 .",
    "the carrying wavenumber is valued from @xmath33 @xmath34 to @xmath65 @xmath34 and in this spectral region we can reach value with equal diffraction and dispersion length , which corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "we use for example bulk fused silica and calculate the linear refractive index from the sellmeier relations @xcite :    @xmath67    with coefficients @xmath68 , wavelengths @xmath69 @xmath6 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath6 where @xmath73",
    ". the choice of carrying wavelength for the optical packet at @xmath74 @xmath6 , ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) is connected with the facts , that fused silica is still transparent on this wavelength and it can be reached easy way by fourth harmonics from nd yag laser on @xmath77 @xmath6 . considering the case of pulses or modulated waves with intensity near the critical for self - focusing @xmath78 , time duration @xmath79 @xmath80 and using the relations @xmath81 , the next values for laser characteristics and material constants are obtained :    @xmath82    these parameters correspond to the next dimensionless constant :    @xmath83    neglecting the small terms from the amplitude equation ( [ tp ] ) we obtain the next equation governing the propagation of optical pulses with different transfer and longitudinal size in uv region of dielectrics :    @xmath84    the scalar variant of this spatiotemporal equation ( [ uv ] ) was introduced for first time by silberberg @xcite and attracts a growing interest . in the beginning this equation was suggested to discover the dynamics of so - called `` light bullets '' ( lb ) , i.e. optical pulses with relatively equal transfer and longitudinal size .",
    "our investigation corrects this idea and finds that the equation ( [ uv ] ) governed the propagation of optical pulses with longitudinal size hundred times greater than the transfer one in uv region of dielectrics and liquids . in the case of optical waves with very small intensity",
    "the nonlinear term can be neglected @xmath85 , and we obtain the linear version of the equation ( [ uv ] ) :    @xmath86    let investigate the two component vector field polarizable in transverse @xmath14 plane . for long pulses , as they are more close to the cw regime , the longitudinal vector component is small and such approximation is possible .",
    "we represent the optical vector field by two orthogonal components @xmath87 and the equation ( [ uv ] ) is transformed to the next nonlinear system of equations :    @xmath88    in the linear case the ( [ sysuv ] ) is reduced to two equal scalar equations for @xmath89 and @xmath90 :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 .",
    "we rewrite the linear scalar equation ( [ lsuv ] ) in cylindrical coordinates :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the linear equation ( [ lc ] )",

    "the solutions ( [ lsol ] ) , ( [ lsol1 ] ) admit modulation frequency @xmath99 and modulation wave vector @xmath100 in z direction .",
    "the existence of such kind solutions for monochromatic light was observed for first time by nye and berry @xcite .",
    "the solutions of kind ( [ lsol]),([lsol1 ] ) admit amplitude and phase singularities .",
    "one elegant way to remove the amplitude singularities by using the combination of gaussian envelope and the solution ( [ lsol1 ] ) with @xmath101 was suggested for first time in @xcite for paraxial beam .",
    "this method is applicable also to the linear equation ( [ lc ] ) and optical vortices in combined pulses with finite amplitudes can be found .",
    "usually the localized solutions of the linear equations are not stable .",
    "now we will turn to most interesting case ; exact solutions of the nonlinear system of equation ( [ sysuv ] ) .",
    "again we rewrite the system ( [ sysuv ] ) in cylindrical variables :    @xmath102    the nonlinear system of equations ( [ nlc ] ) admits another infinite number of exact vortex solutions of kind of :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is one infinite number .",
    "one important consequence of these solutions is , that they are obtained as a balance not only between the diffraction and the nonlinearity , but mostly by the nonlinearity and the angular distribution .",
    "that is why , we can expect one stable propagation of such vortices in z direction .",
    "right away we can point here , that conditions for finiteness of the energy of the above solutions have been not found up to now .",
    "the investigation of the propagation of optical pulses or modulated waves with equal transverse and longitudinal size @xmath106 is more convenient to provide in coordinate system moving with group velocity .",
    "that is why we apply a galilean transformation to the basic vector amplitude equation ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) , as difference from the case of long pulses , where the `` moving in time '' transformation is more natural .",
    "the equation ( [ a11 ] ) in this case is transformed to :    @xmath109    where @xmath24 .",
    "we use again the approximation @xmath31 . to estimate the influence of the different terms on the propagation dynamics we rewrite the equation ( [ a13 ] ) in dimensionless form . defining the rescaled variables :    @xmath110    and constants :    @xmath111    equation ( [ a13 ] )",

    "the soliton case appear as partial case , when equal amount of nonlinear and linear phase shift are compensated , the initial phase different do not changed , and the linear polarization keeps on . for optical pulses with arbitrary amplitudes , as the media is isotropic , the diffraction and the dispersion add equal phases to the two components and they can be written generally in the form :        where @xmath214 is the phase shift due to diffraction , @xmath215 is the phase shift due to dispersion , @xmath216 is the equal phase components for the both amplitudes , and @xmath217 , @xmath217 are the real part of solutions for the amplitudes on distance z in isotropic media . for arbitrary solutions of kind",
    "( [ difdis1 ] ) , ( [ difdis2 ] ) the relation ( [ yar ] ) keeps on for the real part of the amplitudes .",
    "it is following from the fact , that the diffraction and the dispersion effects do not change the initial linear polarization of the pulses ( do not yield linear birefringence in isotropic materials ) .",
    "the nonlinear polarization @xmath218 in the case of isotropic medium is well known and can be written in the form @xcite :            we point here , that the expression is valid not only for nonlinear nonresonant optical response , when @xmath222 , but also for nonlinearity near to some of the resonances , when @xmath223 . in the same way we can obtain",
    ", that the components of the nonlinear polarization for one linear polarized vector in 3d space take forms :        in the case of elliptically polarized light the relation ( [ yar ] ) take form : @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the different of the phase functions for the components of the vector field . since the diffraction and the dispersion add equal amount of phase shift to the different components in isotropic media , the phase different keeps on again .",
    "if we substitute @xmath227 and @xmath228 with such phase difference in the expression for nonlinear polarization ( [ pnl ] ) , and take in mind that @xmath222 for case of nonresonant electronic nonlinearities , the next expression for the components can be found @xcite :        the last terms in equations ( [ pnlx ] ) and ( [ pnly ] ) present degenerate four wave mixing process ( @xmath231 ) . since @xmath232 , this leads to periodically exchange of energy between the elliptically polarized components .",
    "thus , such one exchange of energy can be observed in isotropic material as gases , metal vapors and crystals .",
    "when the phase different vanish ( @xmath233 ) in the case of linearly polarized components , the amplitude functions admit again equal phases , and the nonlinear polarization ( [ pnlx ] ) and ( [ pnly ] ) can be transformed to the nonlinear polarization of linearly polarized components ( [ pnl1 ] ) and ( [ pnl2 ] ) .",
    "this is one generalization of the results obtained for parametric solitons in @xmath234 media @xcite .",
    "when there is no phase different between the components , the parametric therm appear as usual cross - phase term in the dispersion relations , and can be take in mind to determinate the right amplitude constants .",
    "the polarization dynamics in materials which admit modal birefringece is more complicate . in single - mode fiber , where the linear birefgingent effect appear @xcite , additional polarization mode dispersion exists @xcite .",
    "this lead to random birefringence in optical fibers and random phase different in the last parametric terms in ( [ pnlx ] ) and ( [ pnly ] ) .",
    "our numerical experiment show that the parametric effects with random phases are not effective , and can be neglected .",
    "one transitions to the manakov system with coefficients equal to one in front of the cross - terms @xcite is possible again for birefringent materials at elliptically angle @xmath235 between the main axes @xcite .",
