    "the surface plasmon ( sp ) resonance is a very important collective excitation in metallic clusters . @xcite it is the dipolar vibration of the electronic center of mass with respect to the positive ionic charge , analogous to the giant resonance of nuclei .",
    "@xcite since an external electromagnetic dipole field couples directly to the electronic center of mass , the photoabsorption spectrum of a metallic cluster is dominated by the sp .",
    "the lifetime of this collective excitation is a determining factor in the relaxation process studied in femtosecond pump - probe experiments.@xcite    the classical electromagnetic theory for a charged metallic sphere in the vacuum yields the energy @xmath0 of the resonance , with the mie frequency @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the bulk plasma frequency of the metal , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 being the electron density , charge , and mass , respectively . if the clusters are embedded in a matrix ( of dielectric constant @xmath6 ) and/or we consider noble metal clusters ( where the effect of the d electrons can be modeled by a dielectric function @xmath7 ) the mie frequency takes the form @xmath8 .",
    "the mie frequency is close to the experimentally measured resonances .",
    "such an agreement is not surprising since we deal with a collective excitation with a clear classical counterpart .",
    "small red- and blueshifts with respect to @xmath9 have been experimentally observed in different physical conditions , and various microscopic approaches have been developed to account for the frequency shifts .",
    "@xcite the most successful among them are based on a jellium description ( where the ionic positive charges are taken as a uniform background ) and linear - response theory in the framework of the time - dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) .",
    "@xcite    while it is difficult to measure the sp lifetime , numerous data for the linewidths of the absorption peak of ensembles of nanoparticles are available , @xcite but their theoretical analysis has proven to be quite involved . in principle , inhomogeneous effects arising from the dispersion among the probed ensemble of clusters have to be separated from the properties of single particles .",
    "intrinsic effects depending on the bulk properties of the metal have to be separated from size - dependent properties of the cluster , and from the effect of the interaction with the local environment ( matrix ) . in addition , the decay of the sp may follow different channels depending on the size of the cluster .",
    "@xcite we calculate the landau damping contribution to the linewidth ( i.e.  decay into particle - hole pairs ) , which dominates in the case of small clusters of radius @xmath10 in the range 0.52.5 nm .",
    "@xcite for larger particles the landau damping competes with radiation damping .",
    "recent measurements of single - cluster optical absorption have rendered accessible the optical properties of individual nano - objects .",
    "@xcite most of the individual nanoparticles studied so far ( in static @xcite or dynamic @xcite setups ) are too large to be in the landau regime .",
    "however the linewidth of a single @xmath11 nm radius gold nanoparticle has been determined lately .",
    "@xcite the possibility of overcoming the inhomogeneous broadening , and the application as biological markers , resulted in a renewed interest for the optical response of metallic clusters .",
    "kawabata and kubo studied the landau damping of the sp,@xcite and using linear response theory they proposed a total linewidth @xmath12 with @xmath13 a constant intrinsic width and @xmath14 inversely proportional to the particle size @xmath10 .",
    "barma and subrahmanyam , @xcite and yannouleas and broglia @xcite improved this calculation and proposed corrections to the behavior of @xmath15 outside the regime @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fermi energy .",
    "they obtained @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fermi wave - vector , and @xmath20 a function of the ratio @xmath21 .",
    "numerical calculations within the tdlda on free alkaline clusters @xcite agree with this analytical result for @xmath22 nm . for smaller radii , @xmath15 shows a nonmonotonous size dependence superposed to the overall behavior of eq .  .",
    "these shell effects arise from the electron - hole density - density correlations in the angular - momentum restricted density of states , @xcite and a semiclassical evaluation of @xmath15 is in good agreement with tdlda calculations .",
    "the experimentally observed nonmonotonous size dependence of the plasmon linewidth for charged alkaline metal nanoparticles in vacuum @xcite is consistent with the theoretical calculations .",
    "however , our calculated linewidths yield lower bounds for the experimentally measured ones , and the corresponding lifetimes are upper bounds of those found in real systems . further measurements with smaller radii and a narrower size - distribution seem necessary to clearly establish the connection with the theory .",
    "noble metal clusters embedded in inert matrices @xcite also exhibit a nonmonotonous linewidth for small @xmath10 .",
    "however , a direct application of eq .   overestimates the smooth part of @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite this discrepancy motivates us to develop a refined theoretical description of the sp lifetime for the case of clusters with internal dielectric constant @xmath7 and surrounded by a dielectric medium with constant @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of an inhomogeneous dielectric environment leads to the modification of eq .  .",
    "under a weak initial optical excitation , only the first surface plasmon ( that we simply denote  surface plasmon \" when there is no possibility of confusion ) is excited . with sufficiently strong initial excitations",
    ", we can also reach the second quantum level of the center - of - mass motion , known as the second ( or double ) plasmon .",
    "such a resonance will be experimentally relevant provided its lifetime is sufficiently large ( in the scale of @xmath23 ) .",
    "the lifetime is given by the anharmonicities of the center - of - mass system and by its interactions with the other degrees of freedom .",
    "like in the previous discussion , the landau damping is an important channel for the decay of the second plasmon , but a new channel appears when @xmath24 is larger than the ionization energy : the ionization in which the cluster looses an electron into the continuum .",
    "@xcite such a process was discussed in order to interpret the ionization of charged na@xmath25 clusters observed by schlipper and collaborators .",
    "@xcite    we calculate the decay rates associated with different channels for the single- and double - plasmon states using a semiclassical approach within a mean - field description of the nanoparticle .",
    "whenever it is possible , we verify the semiclassical approach by comparing to numerical calculations .",
    "we characterize the size - dependent oscillations of the first and second plasmon linewidths for the case of free alkaline metals .",
    "in addition , we analyze the theoretical difficulties in extending these calculations to the case of embedded and/or noble metal clusters and propose a way to overcome them .",
    "we also apply our semiclassical approach to the calculation of the ionization rate via the double - plasmon channel , and obtain results comparable with the experiments . @xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_ppa ] we introduce the basic formalism for the photoabsorption and the sp linewidth . in sec .",

    "[ sec_dp ] we show a semiclassical description of the two main channels contributing to the decay of the double plasmon : landau damping and ionization . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec_ccl ] we draw the conclusions and the perspectives of our work .",
    "we relegate to the appendix a few technical , but important issues ; in appendix [ mismatch ] we extend the standard calculation of the plasmon linewidth to the case where the cluster is made of a noble metal and/or is embedded in a nonreactive matrix . in appendix",
    "[ sec : semiclassics ] we show how to take advantage of the spherical symmetry in semiclassical calculations like the ones of this paper , and how to recover some well - known results . in appendix [ sec_gh ]",
    "we present the frequency dependence of the different plasmon linewidths .",
    "when the cluster is placed in an electromagnetic field with a wavelength much larger than its size , @xcite the photoabsorption cross section is obtained from the application of the dipole operator on the ground state of the system : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the velocity of light ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the many - body excited states and eigenenergies of the electronic system .",
    "the ground state is noted as @xmath30 and its energy is taken as zero . in eq .  , the photon degrees of freedom have already been integrated out . in order to describe the electronic system",
    ", we consider a closed shell nanoparticle ( perfectly spherical with a  magic number \" of atoms ) within a jellium model .",
    "the hamiltonian representing @xmath31 valence electrons in a uniformly positively charged sphere of charge @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 + \\frac{1}{2 }   \\sum_{\\substack{i , j = 1\\\\(i \\neq j)}}^n   \\frac{e^2}{\\left| { \\bf r}_i - { \\bf r}_j \\right| } , \\ ] ] with the single - particle confining potential @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electronic density and @xmath36 the volume of the particle .",

    "however , this procedure is in general exceedingly difficult , and thus various approximation schemes have been proposed . @xcite among them , the tdlda ( time - dependent local density approximation ) is a numerical approach based on the local density approximation . @xcite we will use this numerical scheme as a check of analytical approaches that instructs us on the physical underlying mechanisms to the plasmon decay",
    "since we are in the long - wavelength limit where the field couples only to the electronic center of mass , a particularly useful decomposition of the hamiltonian is @xmath39 introducing the canonical coordinates @xmath40 , the ( harmonic ) center - of - mass hamiltonian is given by @xmath41 @xmath42 is the hamiltonian of the relative coordinates and @xmath43 expresses the coupling between the two subsystems . introducing the standard position , momentum and lowering operators @xmath44 we can write @xmath45    it is difficult to handle @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the general case .",
    "a notable exception is that of a confining potential which is not given by eq .  , but which is harmonic for all @xmath46 .",
    "we are then in the situation for which kohn s theorem @xcite applies .",
    "it states that in a purely harmonic confinement potential , and with interactions only depending on the interparticle distance , the center of mass and the relative coordinates decouple ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) .",
