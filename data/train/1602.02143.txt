    "in the last decade or so , many astrophysical systems have been discovered with the property of generating collimated flow of plasma with speeds that can approach that of light .",
    "eruption in form of jets is one of the visible appearances of active compact objects that releases large amounts of energy and affects several astrophysical processes in the jets neighbourhood .",
    "the physics and dynamics of the formation and ejection of collimated plasma , in short and long distances with respect to the radius of the central compact object , are still not fully understood , despite great theoretical advances , high performance computer simulations , high precision astronomical observations and enormous experimental plasma researches in laboratories @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is fairly known that strong toroidal magnetic fields from the accretion disk have theirs lines changed sufficiently to collimate , guide and contain the ejected plasma without spreading during its temporal evolution . in the past decades",
    "researches on jet stability have shown the existence of several unstable modes as well stability criteria by analytical techniques in order to stabilize the jet propagation , but so far nothing can fully explain the length of several observable jets @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the substructures formed during propagation jets are also intriguing .",
    "previous studies show that the possible types and forms of the jets and theirs substructures are affected by the accretion disk properties , the magnetic field and the magnetosphere where the system is immersed in @xcite . however , the settings of the initial data for the analytical and computational analysis are still poisoning to remain difficult for the comparison between the theory and the astrophysical observations @xcite or the experiments in plasma laboratories @xcite .",
    "astrophysical systems whose central compact object attracts matter around it , have been modelled by the equations of general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) .",
    "simulations that consider together the accretion process , the jet formation and its ejection in the same temporal evolution have been recently studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the computational implementations of these phenomena through numerical methods are still challenging mainly because it involves many orders of magnitudes in space and time and also because the equations are non - linear .",
    "the moments of transition after the accretion disk formation and the beginning of the ejection are the most difficult to gasp in the numerical simulations because the abrupt changes of physical quantities and the inadequate numerical treatment which add spurious oscillations or excessive dissipation that impairs progress of the simulation or degrade completely the numerical results obtained .    in this context",
    ", @xcite developed a new grmhd code applied to the formation of relativistic jets , able to describe it from the accretion disk of matter up to his ejection altogether .",
    "for such , a central scheme of finite volume without the usual dimensional decomposition and no need of riemann problem solvers , namely nessyahu - tadmor method , was implemented . with this code",
    "it was possible to obtain stable numerical solutions - without spurious oscillations or excessive dissipation - from the magnetized accretion disk process in rotation with respect to a central schwarzschild black hole ( bh ) immersed in a magnetosphere , for the ejection of matter in the form of jet .",
    "we present in this article the settings of the initial conditions capable of simulating the formation of relativistic jets from the accretion disk of matter up to its ejection , including the substructures formations inside jet , through the code developed in @xcite after the initial tests found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we obtained stable jets that reached 20 times the schwarzschild radius and we found some rare simulations with the formation of lobes on the disk itself .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we present the basic equations needed for the modelling the jets formation ; in section 3 we show numerical methods that were applied on problem in study through the new code developed in fortran 90 - the numerical solutions were obtained through the two - dimensional nessyahu - tadmor method and the euler method of four stages to the source terms ; in section 4 we have a simulation of relativistic jet formation and lobe formation ; and in section 5 we wrote the conclusions of this work .",
    "we consider the grmhd equations with predetermined gravitation by a central compact object described simply by a fixed schwarzschild bh .",
    "initially we have a magnetized accretion disk with a strong magnetic field spinning surrounding of the bh and both immersed in a magnetosphere in free fall with respect to bh .",
    "the disk initial set up employs a keplerian velocity profile . from that , the basic dynamic scenery is the following : the disk s fluid is directed into the bh taking with it its magnetic field lines .",
    "then , the material deposited in the vicinity of bh is squeezed and the differential disk rotation velocities provides a helical magnetic field along which the matter is aligned .    depending on the initial values and profile of the : magnetic field , accretion disk density , density of the magnetosphere , disk rotation and opening of disk ; a variety of outcomes are possible as , for example : a large out radial wind not collimated , jets that flowing outwards of the bh poles or lobes on the disk .    in case of jets ,",
    "we find and confirm several studies that the jets motion creates a longitudinal electrical current inducing a toroidal magnetic field able to provide a magnetic pressure that contributes to the jet collimation .",
    "consequently , the jet is formed on the poloidal region of bh , such that its collimation is maintained by the evolved magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , our simulations show some substructures which are formed in the jet during its evolution .    for some initial conditions one can obtain collimated jets , whose extreme in contact with the magnetosphere , concentrates the matter in the form of a lobe in a well understood shock wave pattern .    in the following subsections",
    "we describe the equations of the mathematical model , the settings and initial conditions to for the full evolution from the accretion disk to the formation of relativistic jets and its substructures .",
    "the ideal grmhd equations for modelling the scenery described in section [ scenery ] are the following @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 represent the covariant derivative , @xmath2 the usual partial derivative , @xmath3 the fluid s four - velocity , @xmath4 the fluid s rest mass density , @xmath5 the of the energy momentum tensor of both fluid and electromagnetic field ; and @xmath6 is the electromagnetic field tensor .",

    "the equations ( [ mn0001])-([mn0004 ] ) are rewritten in a conservation law form . in doing",
    "so we can use finite volume methods for obtaining good numerical solutions .",
    "this formulation was initially developed by koide , kudoh and shibata @xcite and some generalization of it are discussed in @xcite .    in this formulation , the components of the vectors @xmath23 of velocity , @xmath24 of magnetic field and @xmath25 of electric field , in fiducial coordinates",

    "the fluid is considered free of electromagnetic forces , no electrical resistivity , in the approximation known as the _ frozen - in _ condition , given by @xmath43      the problem proposed of relativistic jets is modelled by the free - fall , orbit and flow of a magnetized perfect fluid in the static spherical symmetric schwarzschild spacetime such that the bh is responsible for all gravitation involved on the problem .",
    "therefore , in this model , the fluid has no self - gravitation .",
    "the spacetime metric is given by @xmath44 in which @xmath45 is the lapse function @xmath46 @xmath47 is the schwarzschild radius used as distance unit and @xmath48 is the bh mass .",
    "the gravitational constant is set to @xmath49 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath50 are respectively time , the radial coordinate , the polar and the azimuthal coordinate and thus @xmath51      simulations with stable jets formations are obtained through an initial accretion disk which is geometrically thin @xcite in keplerian rotation velocity profile in azimuthal direction @xcite , that is , @xmath52 the accretion disk is a magnetized fluid , which is initially localized on @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the position of the internal edge whose rotation velocity is    @xmath55 and @xmath56 $ ] is the angle with respect to the equator .",
    "a value studied for the opening of the disk is @xmath57 .",
    "the magnetosphere that surrounds the system compound of the accretion disk and the bh is less dense than the disk and , initially , it free - falls toward the bh containing , so only the velocity s radial component is non - zero .",
    "thus , the initial conditions on the density and velocity of matter around the bh are given by    * density : *    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and and @xmath60 are the fluid s density of the magnetosphere and of disk , respectively and @xmath61 in which @xmath62 is ratio between disk density and magnetosphere density .    *",

    "the magnetosphere region has only the radial component of velocity @xmath70 .",
    "one way to determine @xmath65 is through the following equation @xcite ,    @xmath71    where h is a constant related to the enthalpy of the fluid , @xmath21 is a constant related to the specific heat . equation ( [ mod010 ] ) ensures that there is a sonic point between the values of @xmath27 satisfying the equality .",
    "this point separates regions where the fluid has transonic and subsonic speeds ",
    "this property makes a more realistic accretion disk model @xcite . solving equation ( [ mod010 ] ) we find values of @xmath27 to each @xmath45 and so @xmath65 is determined by the lorentz factor , that is , @xmath72 .",

    "the implemented equations in the new developed code are exposed in this section . from the equations of section [ modeljet ] together with some numerical analysis hypotheses we set the numerical algorithms as discussed in @xcite .    in this work",

    "mesh after 2,910 iterations . ]    in coarse grid , the relationship between spatial and temporal increments was @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 .      in this case , we considered a disk @xmath204 times denser than first scenario ( subsection [ first ] ) , that is , we are a disk @xmath205 times denser than magnetosphere ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "its time evolution is similar to the previous case , but with these new settings , we observed the development of the substructure jet within the domain .    in fig .",
    "[ ex2_2340d ] we have the jet formed with a length of @xmath207 . from that moment , the jet undergoes narrowing and a substructure is beginning ( fig . [ ex2_2370d ] ) . by fig .",
    "[ ex2_2373d ] it is noted that there is an accumulation of material at @xmath208 .",
    "such accumulation is developed and its shape is analogous to a lobe ( fig .",
    "[ ex2_2375d ] ) inside of jet .",
    "after , the lobe grows and becomes denser ( fig .",
    "[ ex2_2378d ] ) .",
    "so far , we had stable solutions and from that moment , the numerical solutions are unstable .",
    "because the jet is moving with a much higher speed than the magnetosphere , shocks form at its tip and its deceleration concentrates the matter in the form of a lobe ( figs . [ ex2_2340d ] , [ ex2_2370d ] , [ ex2_2373d ] , [ ex2_2375d ] and [ ex2_2378d ] . in these figures",
    ", we also observed two parts of the jet : a front and a wake .",
    "this simulation showed the following characteristics : a central bh , a thin accretion disk and a relativistic with substructures front , wake and lobe . according to the unified theory of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( reference ) , the lobes are in the fronts of jets produced by a supermassive bh at the center of the galaxy .",
    "the jets extend perpendicularly to the central accretion disk which surrounds the bh .",
    "thus , our simulations produced elements compatible with agn structures .",
    "this shows the potential of the developed code for the study of agn , however , for such statement are needed simulations with real data .",
    "so , with the second scenario adjustments , we have been able to simulate the jets formation , from the process of accretion disk , passing by the ejection and reaching the substructure lobe .",
    "in this work , we were able to simulate the formation of relativistic collimated jets and lobes from the accretion disk rotating around a bh .    for this",
    ", we use a formalism for the grmhd equations with axial symmetry in a fixed schwarzschild metric .",
    "we got stable numerical solutions with good behaviour towards the analytical solution for decreasing spatial domain cells , using central scheme free of riemann solvers , namely two - dimensional nessyahu - tadmor method .    the first simulation , we started with the accretion disk 10,000 times denser than the magnetosphere .",
    "we observed the disk in falling into the bh , the matter deposited around the bh and finally the ejection of a jet up to a distance of @xmath207 . in this case , it has used a @xmath186 mesh which allow one see the formation of substructures along the jet which reaches relativistic speeds .",
    "comparisons were performed between numerical solutions at different meshes @xmath195 , @xmath186 and @xmath196 .",
    "thus , it was verified stable solutions and with no significant differences between the solutions obtained in the meshes @xmath186 and @xmath196 .    in the firs scenario ,",
    "now with @xmath195 grid , we performed the jet until it reaches our outer radius , that is , until jet gets to @xmath200 . in this case",
    ", we observed the formation of a substructure at distance of almost @xmath200 .",
    "so , in the second scenario , a new adjustment was realised .",
    "we set the initial accretion disk 100,000 times denser than the magnetosphere and , with this , we have gotten simulations with formation of substructure named lobe , close to the disk not on the axis .",
