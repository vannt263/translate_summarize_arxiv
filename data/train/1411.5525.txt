    "<S> we report a systematic polarization - dependent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the three - dimensional electronic structure of the recently discovered 112-type iron - based superconductor ca@xmath0la@xmath1feas@xmath2 ( @xmath3  =  0.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides the commonly reported three hole - like and two electron - like bands in iron - based superconductors , we resolve one additional hole - like band around the zone center and one more fast - dispersing band near the @xmath4 point in the vicinity of fermi level . by tuning the polarization and the energy of incident photons , we are able to identify the specific orbital characters and the @xmath5 dependence of all bands . combining with band calculations , we find as @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals contribute significantly to the additional three - dimensional hole - like band and the narrow band , respectively . also , there are considerable hybridization between the as @xmath6 and fe 3@xmath8 orbitals in the additional hole - like band , which suggests the strong coupling between the unique arsenic zigzag bond layers and the feas layers therein . </S>",
    "<S> our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the orbital characters of the low - lying band structure of 112-type iron - based superconductors , which can be a starting point for the further understanding of their unconventional superconductivity . </S>"
