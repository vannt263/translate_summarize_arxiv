    "analytic solutions of the classical nonlinear @xmath0 model @xcite have been studied as candidates of the disoriented chiral condensates ( dccs ) @xcite .",
    "the solutions so far obtained are either configurations with spatially uniform isospin distribution or those which are chirally equivalent to them .",
    "when the isospin - uniform dccs decay , the decay pions will obey the event - by - event pion charge distribution of @xmath1 in the neutral pion fraction @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we study as dcc candidates the time - dependent solutions of the nonlinear @xmath0-model that are topologically nontrivial in the isospin - orbital space .",
    "though the topologically nontrivial dccs obey the same charge distribution @xmath3 as that of statistically random emission , the angle - rapidity distribution of pions should exhibit a very distinct experimental signature .",
    "we suggest a quantitative method of analysis to search for these dccs .    0.5 in",
    "let us express the pion field @xmath4 nonlinearly in terms of the scalar phase field @xmath5 and the unit isovector field @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "apart from the source term , the lagrangian is given in terms of @xmath9 by @xmath10 in the chiral symmetry limit .",
    "after elimination of the lagrange multiplier @xmath11 , the euler - lagrange equation reads @xcite @xmath12 @xmath13    the analytic solutions so far known are either those with @xmath14 ( the anselm class ) or those which are rotated to them by chiral transformations . in this paper",
    "we explore the class of solutions whose @xmath6 fields point radially in the spacetime of @xmath15 dimensions : @xmath16 we have obtained a hint for this postulate from the skyrme assumption that led to the static soliton @xcite . unlike skyrme , we do not need a stabilizing term in the lagrangian since the static stability of solutions is irrelevant to us .",
    "the spherical symmetry of @xmath6 suggests we should choose @xmath5 also to be spherically symmetric as @xmath17 it is important to observe that with our postulate the euler - lagrange equation ( 4 ) for @xmath6 is automatically satisfied for any @xmath18 .",
    "the equation for @xmath5 now reads @xmath19 this wave equation allows many interesting solutions .",
    "all of them are topologically nontrivial since following the skyrme model we can introduce the topological charge , @xmath20 where @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "the current @xmath23 is locally conserved , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is invariant under chiral @xmath26 rotations .",
    "the charge @xmath25 is nonvanishing for our solutions while it is zero for the isospin uniform solutions .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath25 is time dependent when we compute it for the pion fields alone since the current @xmath23 flows from the shell of hadron debris into the dcc .",
    "actually it is not even finite since our pion fields are singular as we approach the light cone .",
    "this should not bother us since the nonlinear @xmath0 model after all does not apply to the close neighborhood of the light cone where kinetic energy is too large .",
    "our purpose of mentioning the topological charge @xmath25 here is that our solutions are chirally inequivalent to the isospin - uniform solutions .",
    "when we adopt our solutions as dcc candidates , we do not accept the skyrme model of baryons @xcite in which the charge @xmath25 is identified with the baryon number . if we did , our dccs would be loaded with nucleons or antinucleons .",
    "let us solve for @xmath18 by restricting the form of @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath27 is dimensionless and its equation of motion is scale invariant , a simple case of interest is that @xmath18 is a function only of the ratio of @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 the wave equation then turns into @xmath31 it can be easily solved numerically .",
    "the behavior at @xmath32 is determined by the singularity at @xmath32 in the wave equation ( [ theta ] ) . barring a singularity at @xmath33 for @xmath5",
    "since a source does not exists at @xmath33 after @xmath34 , we determine that @xmath35 as @xmath36 . by giving one more boundary condition ,",
    "@xmath37 at @xmath32 , we can compute a profile of the scalar phase field @xmath38 . in fig.1",
    "we have plotted @xmath38 for a few different values of @xmath39 . on the light cone ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath18 is singular because of @xmath41 in the third term of eq.([theta ] ) , but only in the immediate neighborhood of @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath38 is smooth and monotonic practically everywhere inside the light cone .    when @xmath18 is not a function only of @xmath42 , analyticity at @xmath33 requires the behavior @xmath43 at @xmath44 , not necessarily @xmath45 .",
    "we have drawn the asymptotic configuration @xmath46 in fig.2 .",
    "the static equation for @xmath46 is invariant under rescaling of @xmath28 . as we know from the skyrme model , this @xmath46 is not a local minimum of energy with respect to rescaling of @xmath28 since there is no skyrme term in our lagrangian . in the dynamical case under considerations , solutions of all different scales",
    "are acceptable for @xmath46 .",
    "the amount of energy fed in by the hadron debris determines the scale of a dcc that is produced .    from the viewpoint of total energy , the nontrivial *",
    "n*(x ) costs nothing since @xmath47 remains at the bottom of the double - well potential and the static @xmath48 does not contribute to kinetic energy .",
    "as far as energy is concerned , the topologically nontrivial solutions are no different from the isospin - uniform solutions .    0.5 in",
    "it might appear that the topologically nontrivial dccs have zero isospin because of the _ spherical symmetry_. it is not correct . at the quantum level",
    "they are not eigenstates of @xmath49 but superpositions of eigenstates of many different isospin values . to see it , we should represent the quantum state of the classical configuration by the coherent state @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the isovector quantum pion field .",
    "the exponent is invariant under the simultaneous isospin - orbital rotations generated by @xmath52 , where * l * is orbital angular momentum .",
    "therefore this state is an eigenstate of @xmath53 , not of @xmath49 nor @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the exponent of eq.([state ] ) can be expressed in terms of the creation operators @xmath55 of pions with charge @xmath56 , energy @xmath57 , and orbital angular momentum ( @xmath58 ) as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the bessel transform @xmath61 .",
    "projection onto the @xmath62 pion state of eq.([state ] ) is @xmath62-th power of eq.([exponent ] ) operated on @xmath63 . by isospin decomposition",
    "we see that the state is not purely an isosinglet but has a wide distribution in @xmath64 .",
    "it is remarked that the initial state of @xmath65 collision has @xmath53 or @xmath66 in the case of head - on collision with zero impact parameter since @xmath67 and @xmath49 or @xmath66 .    0.5 in",
    "we study the spectrum of the pions decaying from the topologically nontrivial dccs .",
    "we focus on the correlation between the isospin and momentum distributions since it shows a distinct characteristic .",
    "let us describe the expanding hadron debris of the baked alaska scenario @xcite by the isovector source @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the standard method @xcite gives the momentum spectrum of the pions with the cartesian isospin component @xmath70 and momentum @xmath71 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the four - dimensional fourier transform with @xmath74 for massless pions , @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a unit cartesian isospin vector along the _",
    "i_-th direction .",
    "the spherically symmetric pion fields , @xmath18 and @xmath77 , can be produced only by @xmath68 of the same symmetry .",
    "therefore @xmath68 may be expressed as @xmath78 then the @xmath71 dependence of its fourier transform is determined in the form @xmath79 substituting eq.([rho ] ) in eq.([distribution ] ) , we find that the pion isospin is correlated with the momentum direction as @xmath80 namely , neutral pions are emitted preferentially along the @xmath81-axis while charged pions are into the @xmath82-plane .",
    "note however that the @xmath81-axis does not necessarily coincide with the collision axis . for some dcc",
    ", the z - axis happens to be the collision axis .",
    "then many other dccs can exist that are related to this one by isospin rotations .",
    "they form one isospin family of dcc solutions .",
    "when the @xmath81-axis coincides with the collision axis , we expect to see a pair of parallel @xmath83-rich bands around @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the @xmath86-@xmath87 plot , where @xmath86 is the azimuthal angle of the pion momentum @xmath71 around the collision axis and @xmath87 is the rapidity variable .",
    "the region between the two bands is filled dominantly with charged pions .",
    "when the isospin axis is not parallel to the collision axis , a pair of @xmath83-rich domains is found at ( @xmath86 , @xmath84 ) and ( @xmath88 , @xmath85 ) in the @xmath86-@xmath87 plot .",
    "the two @xmath83-rich domains are separated by a @xmath89-rich region ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the event - by - event distribution @xmath3 of the neutral pion fraction @xmath90 can be obtained from eq.([correlation ] ) . by integrating over the angles of @xmath71",
    ", we find that the particle multiplicity is equal for all three pion charge states .",
    "therefore the distribution @xmath3 can not distinguish the topologically nontrivial dcc events from random emission events .",
    "we can make search of the topologically nontrivial dccs more quantitative .",
    "we should first select the dcc candidates , for instance , by abundance of soft @xmath91 pions and find their approximate overall rest frames . to enhance the signature , we should select only those events with @xmath92 .",
    "we then determine event by event the isospin _ polar _ direction @xmath93 , namely the @xmath83-dominant direction in the momentum space , by maximizing a suitably defined quantity as follows : by choosing a tentative @xmath94 direction , compute for @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the unit vectors along neutral and charged pion momenta , respectively , and the summations are taken over all dcc pions from each event ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "then vary the direction of @xmath94 so as to maximize the product @xmath101 the quantity @xmath102 takes the maximum value when @xmath94 coincides with the isospin polar axis .",
    "let this maximum be @xmath103 .",
    "then compute @xmath102 for the same @xmath94 direction by interchanging @xmath89 and @xmath83 .",
    "let us call it @xmath104 .",
    "then the ratio @xmath105 is equal to 5/7 for the topologically nontrivial dccs with sufficiently large @xmath62 . as the direction of @xmath94",
    "is varied , @xmath106 sweeps between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath106 is independent of the direction of @xmath94 and equal to zero for the isospin - uniform dccs as well as for random emission .",
    "feasibility of this test depends on how large @xmath62 is .",
    "since the statistical errors are of o@xmath109 , @xmath110 will do .    0.5 in",
    "the topologically nontrivial solutions of the form @xmath38 behave like @xmath111 at @xmath112 . at sufficiently large @xmath29 , therefore , the phase pion field @xmath38 approaches zero , that is , the background vacuum relaxes to the true vacuum at any fixed location off the light cone . if the dcc is defined to be the disoriented condensate that would approach a _",
    "wrong _ vacuum at @xmath113 , one might not want to call such a condensate as the dcc @xcite .",
    "when we make chiral rotations on @xmath38 , we obtain infinitely many more solutions that carry the same topological charge but different vector - isospin distributions . by actually performing the axial - isospin rotations",
    ", we can obtain solutions whose @xmath6 is not spherical at finite @xmath29 .",
    "as @xmath113 , these rotated solutions approach static limits with uniform isospin orientations at all finite locations : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the axis of an axial - vector isospin rotation ( @xmath116 ) and @xmath117 is its rotation angle ( @xmath118 ) @xcite .",
    "namely , the asymptotic disorientation stays nonvanishing and turns uniform .    when @xmath18 is not a function only of @xmath119 , we have found @xmath43 at @xmath44 , instead of @xmath120 .",
    "it remains _ disoriented _ and _ nontrivial _ as @xmath121 even at @xmath122 .",
    "chiral rotations transform @xmath123 into nonspherical @xmath6 .    0.5 in",
    "in the presence of an explicit chiral symmetry breaking , a dcc can not really reach its asymptotic limit predicted by the chiral symmetric wave equations .",
    "it starts decaying before its kinetic energy @xmath124 becomes comparable with the potential difference of the symmetry breaking @xmath125 .",
    "however , the postulate of @xmath77 is still compatible with the explicit chiral symmetry breaking . furthermore the topological charge @xmath25",
    "is defined in the same form and the local current conservation @xmath24 remains valid .",
    "the only change is appearance of a scale breaking term proportional to @xmath126 in the wave equation of @xmath18 : @xmath127 with the explicitly scale dependent term present , we can no longer postulate @xmath128 .",
    "instead @xmath5 is a function of two dimensionless variables @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "but the wave equation still allows a spherically symmetric @xmath18 , and the behavior @xmath131 at @xmath44 is not affected by the symmetry breaking .",
    "as long as the form of @xmath48 is the same , our prediction in the @xmath86-@xmath87 distribution of the decaying pions is valid with no modification .    0.5 in",
    "we have argued that topologically nontrivial dccs are not only possible but also have an equally good or bad change of being produced as the isospin - uniform ones .",
    "if they are actually produced , they will show a clear experimental signature in the @xmath86-@xmath87 plot of the decay pions . in order to produce them",
    "the hadron debris must also expand with a spherically symmetric isospin distribution @xmath132 according to geometrical symmetry .",
    "no dynamical mechanism is known that suppresses such a configuration of hadron debris . in a dcc search",
    "the topologically nontrivial dccs should also be searched for by the analysis proposed here .    0.5 in",
