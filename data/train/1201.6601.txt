    "physics education is key to the development of new physicists and to the development of the field through physics research .",
    "other than working in research labs doing fundamental physics research , many physicists go on to solve important problems while working in other fields .",
    "an effective physics curriculum clearly prepares students for a diverse array of jobs , which explains in part why physicists are well - known for being resourceful problem solvers .",
    "@xcite concluded that the basis of this problem solving ability is the array of cognitive connections between multiple concepts , making each physics concept a part of a coherent whole rather than disparate bits of information  @xcite .",
    "fuller points out the importance of a good conceptual understanding when he says , `` every physicist knows the importance of having the correct concept in mind _ before _ beginning to solve a problem , ''  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* emphasis ours ) .",
    "categorization studies comparing experts and novices started with @xcite , who studied the categorization of introductory physics problems  @xcite .",
    "this study , which , to date , has been cited over 3000 times , has been critical in the study of the differences between experts and novices in many areas such as clinical psychology  @xcite , dinosaur expertise  @xcite , wine tasting  @xcite , and even star wars philosophy  @xcite .",
    "all of these studies go back to the same apparently straightforward result in physics : novices categorize introductory physics problems by `` surface features '' ( e.g.   `` incline , '' `` pendulum , '' or `` projectile motion '' ) , while experts use `` deep structure '' ( e.g.   `` energy conservation '' or `` newton s second law '' ) .",
    "we now take a closer look at previous categorization studies involving physics problems .",
    "the novice group of @xcite s study was made up of eight students who had just finished the first semester of an introductory university physics class , and the expert group was made up of eight advanced ph.d .",
    "physics students .",
    "both groups were given the instructions to sort the problems `` based on similarity of solution''@xcite .",
    "problems were allowed to be placed in two ( or more ) categories if the sorter so desired ; we call this `` multiple categorization , '' as opposed to `` single categorization , '' where each problem would have to be sorted in one and only one category .",
    "each sorter categorized their set in front of a member of the research team according to a uniform protocol .",
    "sorters were required to sort the problems without paper and pencil to prevent them from actually solving the problems . after sorting the problems a second time",
    " to check for consistency  the sorters explained the reasoning for their groupings .",
    "after a qualitative analysis of the category names used by more than two sorters , @xcite s group concluded that the key distinction between experts and novices is , quite sensibly , that experts sort problems based on the physics principle required to solve each problem , while novices sort the problems based on surface features .",
    "this difference in categorization , @xcite concluded , was an experts ability to convert contextual cues from the problem texts and figures into the physics principles that are required to solve those problems .",
    "the main message from chi s paper is that this difference in categorization behavior allows experts to be better problem solvers than novices @xcite .    in a subsequent study ,",
    "veldhuis attempted to verify the result of @xcite @xcite .",
    "veldhuis had three groups , a novice group comprised of 94 introductory physics students , an intermediate group of 5 students who had just finished classical mechanics , and an expert group of 20 physics professors  among whom only 2 had not taught calculus - based physics .",
    "veldhuis created four different categorization sets , one of which was given to each subject to categorize according to a protocol similar to that used by @xcite s group .",
    "the first set was created in an attempt to mimic the @xcite problem set @xcite , and the second was a control set with a similar collection of end - of - chapter problems .",
    "in contrast , the third and fourth sets were carefully constructed so that each problem had only a single physics principle and a single surface feature from a set of principles and surface features @xcite .",
    "for example , table [ matrix ] shows how the third set was constructed by populating a matrix of four surface and four conceptual features .",
    "the fourth set was also `` rigged . ''",
    "it had the same number of cards , but only two surface and two conceptual features .",
    "@xcite could not draw a conclusion from the categorizations from his first two problem sets .",
    "however , sets 3 and 4 agreed with @xcite in that experts categorize problems based on physics principles while novices show a `` more complex behavior . ''",
    "@xcite ironically , @xcite observed that distinguishing experts and novices based on surface features of their categorizations failed unless the desired physics features  conceptual and surface  were built into the design of the experiment .",
    "lllll & newton ii & e cons & @xmath0 cons & @xmath1 cons +   + spring & prob 16 & prob 2 & prob 4 & prob 9 + ramp & prob 11 & prob 6 & prob 12 & prob 15 + pulley & prob 5 & prob 14 & prob 13 & prob 8 + terms & prob 3 & prob 10 & prob 7 & prob 1 +    more recently , the work done in singh s group at the university of pittsburgh has broadened the application of `` card - sorting '' to other fields  @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared students in introductory physics courses with both physics graduate students and physics faculty .",
    "@xcite created two categorization sets of twenty - four problems each .",
    "the first set was created in an attempt to mimic @xcite s set .",
    "seven problems were directly from @xcite s original set , based on examples given in the paper , while the remainder of the @xcite s original set is apparently lost in history .",
    "a second set was devised because the results from the first set showed `` major differences '' with @xcite s data  @xcite , which may not be surprising given veldhuis s previous results  @xcite .",
    "each subject , upon reading the problems , filled in three columns on a response sheet : category name , the appropriateness of the category name , and the identity of problems that fit in the category .",
    "@xcite then rated each problem s category as `` good , '' `` moderate , '' or `` poor '' based on each sorter s description of the category .",
    "a category was considered ` good ' if it was based on the underlying physics principles .",
    "he then asked a faculty panel to validate his ratings by following the same procedure on a subset of the categorizations .",
    "@xcite found that the problems taken directly from @xcite s original study were placed by novices in `` good '' categories far less often than they did on average , determining that they were generally from topics more difficult to novice students .",
    "for example , difficult topics for novices might have been rotational motion , non - equilibrium applications of newton s 2nd law , or the work - energy theorem @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that the superficial category names were far less prevalent in his study than in chi s original study .",
    "it is possible that the shift away from novices use of superficial category names is due to a change in curricular focus precipitated by @xcite s result .",
    "contrary to the sharp distinction found by @xcite , @xcite found that there was some overlap between the calculus - based introductory physics students and the graduate students  @xcite .    in a follow - up study , @xcite  @xcite asked graduate student teaching assistants to perform a similar categorization exercise , both as themselves and through the eyes of their students , and compared both types of their categorizations to physics faculty and introductory students .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , @xcite considered the physics faculty as the `` true experts '' and only looked at graduate students as a sort of intermediate group .",
    "similar to @xcite , problem categories were rated to be `` good '' , `` moderate , '' or `` poor , '' validated by a faculty panel . @xcite",
    "found that the graduate students acting as introductory students performed better on the categorization task than did actual introductory students , thus overestimating their students  @xcite .",
    "singh found that the professors performed best on the categorization task , distinguishing this group from the categorizations of the graduate students acting as themselves .",
    "this suggested that the use of graduate students as an expert group is not entirely accurate , as their behavior is not truly expert - like .",
    "finally , in a separate study , @xcite also carried out a categorization study concerning quantum mechanics problems @xcite .",
    "for this task the novice group consisted of twenty - two junior and senior physics majors taking quantum mechanics .",
    "the expert group consisted of six faculty members @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the previous studies mentioned here , @xcite chose to have a three - member faculty panel evaluate all of the categorizations , scoring each category as either good , moderate , or poor .",
    "in contrast to the studies of introductory physics problems , in @xcite s study , the expert group had more variability , as even the faculty panel did not see this task in stark terms .",
    "two of the panel members even said that they disliked using the terms `` good '' and `` poor '' to describe a categorization of quantum mechanics problems ; this reservation was not voiced by the raters in the introductory problem categorization studies @xcite .",
    "similarly , the faculty panel members said that sometimes they preferred another categorization choice to their own @xcite .",
    "all of this , @xcite conclude , was due to the more difficult nature of the problems . in any case",
    ", it is clear that no `` ideal '' set of groupings existed , and it was impossible to simply assign some `` score '' to a given categorization .    in summary",
    ", replicating @xcite s seminal experiment is challenging . more often than not , attempts to repeat it fail , as an informal survey among physics education researchers indicates  however , such null - results do not get published . yet , as a community of physics educators , we hold a firm belief that deep down there is a significant difference in problem solving behavior between experts and novices , and that categorization is an important piece of the puzzle . quantifying this difference",
    ", however , more often than not , remains elusive .",
    "while @xcite s method has been the predominant paradigm for follow - up studies , their methodology is based on a certain model of the categorization process . using a different model , one will arrive at a different methodology .",
    "given the importance of this experimental technique , we believe it is important to understand the underlying model and consider alternatives to its assumptions .",
    "@xcite s group looked at a processed version of the category names agreed upon by multiple sorters and counted the number of problems in each category name @xcite .",
    "their analysis does not seem to hinge on the identity of the problems in each group , merely the number of problems in that group .",
    "for example , if two sorters both used the category name `` conservation of energy '' but one sorter put problems @xmath2 in that set and the other sorter put problems @xmath3 in that set , @xcite s analysis would count that as two people who both used an energy related variant as a category and both had five problems in that set . in other words ,",
    "the sets would be treated identically .",
    "we argue that it is important that these two groups should be treated _ differently _ , as they have few identical elements .",
    "we believe that instead of just these `` macroscopic '' measures ( sizes and names of groups ) , the sorting results should also be compared on the `` microscopic '' level of individual problems .",
    "different understandings of the underlying process of categorization will lead to different statistical analysis methods . @xcite",
    "seem to view categorization as a deterministic process , as evidenced by the `` double - check '' step in their experimental method .",
    "they see any minor replication variation as evidence of an underlying method . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the phenomena that physics education research has to grapple with is the variability of learner responses to what appear to be identical scenarios , see for example @xcite  @xcite . rather than interpreting card - sorting outcomes as reflections of stable theories or beliefs ,",
    "an alternative model is that they are based on _ ad hoc _ assemblies of more simple intuitions ( similar to `` phenomenological primitives , ''  @xcite or `` resources ''  @xcite )  those are then assembled `` on - the - fly , '' and the particular assembly may vary on circumstances .",
    "there is no reason to expect that card - sorting experiments are immune to this variability , and one may thus expect that any sorter who categorizes the same set of problems on separate occasions would return different results , although he or she might even recognize the problems that are used .",
    "we can not control the actual mechanisms potentially underlying these `` random '' outcomes , but have accounted for the resulting variability in the choice of our statistical methods . in addition , we use sample - based statistics to interpret our categorization data , realizing that our sample is only part of a vastly larger population .",
    "previous analysis methods @xcite describe each categorization individually with a score , which is either a comparison to an `` ideal '' categorization set or an individual `` grade '' of each set .",
    "these methods measure performance on the categorization task , where the scoring criteria is an input of the evaluation process  the process starts with assumptions of what properties an expert categorization will have .",
    "it may , however , not be clear what an `` ideal '' set is , which in turn makes the scoring somewhat ambiguous .",
    "first , curricular emphasis within any physics program varies over time ; as does the researcher s personal categorization . therefore that researcher may rate the same data differently",
    "if he or she were to re - evaluate the same categorization set again .",
    "second , the experiment will not be repeatable from one group to another using these methods because each individual experimenter s ideal categorization of the same set will be different , possibly creating a large distortion in the analysis .",
    "third , as @xcite found , as topics become more complex , an expert will express uncertainty in his or her own choice , sometimes preferring the choice of another to his or her own .",
    "finally , if one evaluates each categorization subjectively based on the expected deep structure category for each problem , one assumes the deep structure vs. surface features distinction rather letting that be a conclusion of the statistical analysis .",
    "we believe that any groupings should emerge from the data itself . in other words , the properties and patterns of what makes",
    "a categorization expert - like should be an output of the experiment .",
    "similar to outcomes from non - parametric data - mining , it may not always be clear what these characteristics _ mean _ , as they are frequently combinations of many features or latent factors .      finally , several studies utilized dendograms to interpret their data , e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite . while dendograms are intuitive , they are not very stable .",
    "@xcite  @xcite investigated a number of clustering algorithms and compared them using monte - carlo generated data from a defined , yet synthetic , cluster model which employed random perturbations . according to @xcite , complete linkage clustering",
    ", a type of dendogram analysis , struggles to recover clusters when there are outliers present in the dataset .",
    "another type of dendogram analysis , single linkage clustering , is highly sensitive to noise in the dataset .",
    "it is for these reasons that it is important to pre - process your data before putting in a subset of your sorters so that you get a dendogram that is clear and interpretable .",
    "however , interpreting a dendogram is a subjective exercise as each dendogram will have a unique threshold where the tree has clustered into groups , yet has not begun to coalesce into a single stem on the tree .",
    "some dendograms do not have any distinguishable groups at all .",
    "we desired to have an experimental method that required no pre - processing , with a reliable and easily interpretable output suitable for further analysis . as a result",
    ", we have chosen a different approach , based on graphs .",
    "given the above concerns , we explored a different model of analyzing and interpreting card - sorting data . to describe clustering on an individual problem level",
    ", we decided to approach the analysis as a network . instead of looking at piles",
    ", we decided to look at individual question cards ( nodes in the network ) and relationships ( edges , in this case due to nodes `` being in the same pile '' ) .",
    "networks are well described by graph theory . as the relationship `` being in the same pile '' has no direction ( if problem a is in the same pile as b , then b is in the same pile as a ) , we are looking at undirected graphs .",
    "the resulting graphs have the advantage of converting an abstract network into an object that can both be visualized and analyzed using an established canon of mathematical methods .    as scientists , we prefer simple explanations to complex ones , and sought to distinguish experts from novices using the simplest test possible .",
    "it is for this reason that we compare these categorizations macroscopic features before continuing on to microscopic features .",
    "the key distinction between the macroscopic and microscopic scales is that the macroscopic scale should not be sensitive to the identity of the problems , while the microscopic scale should be highly sensitive to problem identity . in choosing mathematical methods for further analysis ,",
    "we were unexpectedly limited by one feature of @xcite s and subsequent studies : the `` multiple categorization , '' i.e. , the fact that one and the same question card is allowed to be in more than one pile .",
    "this presented a challenge to several existing algorithms .",
    "the key measurement we make is a `` distance '' measurement between each pair of categorizations .",
    "given these distances , we used principal components analysis ( pca ) to visualize the data in a few simple plots .",
    "we designed and carried out a card - sorting experiment on physics experts and novices at michigan state university .",
    "a total of 18 physics professors and 23 novices participated in our study .",
    "all of the novices have completed at least the first semester of an introductory physics course at msu .",
    "we gave each sorter a set of 50 problems to sort based on similarity of solution .",
    "the physics faculty were given the set and allowed to choose a time when they would complete the task at their convenience while the novices were asked to complete the task during a window of a few hours in an informally supervised setting .",
    "each sorter categorized his or her problems and recorded his groups and group names in a separate packet .",
    "multiple categorization was allowed , but it was in no way communicated to the individual sorters that this practice was expected or endorsed .",
    "analyzing the experimental data in terms of graphs requires a shift in conceptualization . as a simple example ,",
    "consider ten questions categorized into four categories .",
    "suppose that the first category is newton s second law and contains problems @xmath4 .",
    "suppose also that the second category is conservation of energy and contains problems @xmath5 , the third category is conservation of momentum and contains problems @xmath6 , and the fourth category is kinematics and contains problems @xmath7 . at this stage in the process , the names of the categories are irrelevant .",
    "in order to create a graph of categorization data we represented question ( cards ) as the nodes and used each category to create a set of edges . to start out",
    ", we summarize the categorization information in a matrix @xmath8 .",
    "this matrix is a boolean ( @xmath9 ) table with the items being sorted placed along the rows and the categories in each column . for this example categorization",
    "the @xmath8 matrix is : @xmath10 this is then converted into a weighted adjacency matrix @xmath11 representing the number of times that item @xmath12 and item @xmath13 are in the same category .",
    "specifically , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the kronecker delta .",
    "note that @xmath16 because in the context of graph theory a term on the diagonal will draw an edge from an object to itself .",
    "thus , @xmath11 represents the number of edges that must be drawn between two vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 on the graph .",
    "the graph of this example is shown in figure [ ex_graph ] .    also from the weighted adjacency matrix the adjacency matrix @xmath17",
    "can be derived : @xmath18 we applied this method to the physics problem categorizations created by each sorter . in doing so",
    ", we obtained i ) graphs that we may inspect visually ii ) adjacency matrices which will be useful for the calculation of certain statistics and iii ) weighted adjacency matrices which will be useful when we consider our distance metric .    in order to visualize the graphs seen in figure  [ ex_graph ] as well as the other categorization graphs throughout this paper",
    ", we utilized the r statistical software s",
    "@xcite igraph package@xcite .",
    "there are currently 13 different algorithms programmed into r for determining node placement , and each would cause the same graph to look very differently .",
    "we initially used the kamada - kawai algorithm  @xcite , however , we eventually chose the fruchterman - reingold algorithm  @xcite because it does the best job of illustrating multiple categorization .",
    "[ sgraphs ] shows the power of the visualization technique : while our sample data had more than 40 participants sorting 50 cards each into any number of piles , flipping through the graphs in less than a minute allowed us to identify the outliers ( such as sorter 16 in the figure ) and general features along which to distinguish the sorters .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as standard models failed to reproduce our experimental data in a satisfactory way , we constructed our own model , which is directly based on the rules of the categorization experiment :    1 .",
    "all questions must be put into a category .",
    "2 .   all categories must have at least one question in them .",
    "3 .   a question may fall into more than one category .",
    "the latter rule is mathematically cumbersome , but had to be included since it is standard procedure in most experiments , including the one that was the base of our sample data in the previous section .",
    "our new model , which we call the cognitive categorization model ( ccm ) , has three parameters : the first parameter of the ccm model @xmath19 represents the number of questions that are being categorized in the experiment .",
    "the second parameter is the average number of categories determined by a sorter . as we described in subsection",
    "[ subsec : numcat ] , a shifted binomial distribution fits the category number data rather well .",
    "a binomial distribution is the `` weighted coin '' distribution  if you flip a weighted coin @xmath20 times , what is the probability that you will get `` heads '' @xmath21 times ? in principle , one can flip a coin @xmath20 times and get tails every time . by rule # 1",
    ", we do not want to allow zero categories , therefore we must introduce a shift .",
    "it would also be senseless to create more categories than questions , so we wish to choose a number of categories from between 1 and @xmath22 .",
    "the simplest way to do this is to generate a number from the binomial distribution between 0 and @xmath23 and then add 1 to each of these randomly generated values .",
    "the probability of success is chosen to correspond to the final average number of categories .",
    "the final parameter is the probability to categorize a card into more than one pile .",
    "after each problem has been sorted into a single pile , the algorithm tests whether that problem should be sorted into other categories as well .",
    "our model , with 2 free parameters is on par with the erds - renyi  model ( 1 free parameter ) and the barabasi model ( 2 free parameters ) .",
    "in addition to the fact that the ccm parameters are interpretable , the small number of ccm parameters makes this model parsimonious .",
    "appendix  [ pcode ] shows the pseudocode for this model . in our code , we implement multiple categorization by generating a random number between zero and one and comparing that number to our multiple categorization probability .",
    "however , there are a number of ways that we can model the multiple categorization probability .",
    "the simplest way is to allow every sorter to have a uniform probability and say that some percentage of the time a card will be split again .",
    "so for this model the multiple categorization probability is constant : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant between zero and one which applies to the entire population .",
    "another way that we consider assumes that a penalty is incurred whenever a card is split : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant between zero and one which applies to the entire population and @xmath20 is the number of times that a problem has already been categorized by a random sorter .",
    "finally , we consider a model where the multiple categorization probability depends on the number of categories @xmath28 that a sorter has selected which was determined by the binomial distribution .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant between zero and one which applies to the entire population .",
    "the differences between these three choices are so subtle that we can not see a difference between them by eye using the graphical representation .    in order to determine best - fitting parameters for each of the models we considered",
    ", we minimized the ks - test statistic between the data 3-cycle distribution and the model 3-cycle distribution .",
    "for the ccm , we used a simple brute - force grid search instead of the standard optimization algorithm found in the r statistical software@xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference was that the 3-cycle distribution was better approximated with smaller sample sizes for the two standard graph theory models .",
    "however , running the standard optimization algorithm for the larger sample sizes required by the cognitive categorization model took much longer and the brute force method quickly became preferable as we could use smaller sample sizes to get some coarse grained resolution .",
    "later , we then used larger sample sizes when we got close to the end result .",
    "once we obtained optimized parameters for the different ccms , we compare them ( see figure [ ccmecdfs ] ) to the human sorters based on the 3-cycle distribution .",
    "we found that the best fitting ccm had a multiple categorization probability that depended on the number of categories as seen in equation  [ ccmv3 ] .",
    "figure [ ccmgraphs ] shows us some example ccm graphs displayed with optimized input parameters for the model that we eventually select .",
    "these ccm graphs shown look much more like the graphs of the human sorters seen in fig .",
    "[ sgraphs ] .",
    "the success of this model gives us insight into the behavior of our sorters as the probability to categorize a single problem in multiple categories is different for each person and that probability actually decreases with the number of categories that are created .",
    "this model prediction is supported by an observation we made of our sorters .",
    "we observed two different sorter behaviors while they worked on the categorization task .",
    "it seemed like some people were resolved to make as few piles as possible , we will call these people `` stackers . ''",
    "stackers were more likely to put a problem in multiple categories , deciding that putting a problem into two piles was a better decision than making a new category .",
    "as a result a stacker s groups tend to be large and inclusive .",
    "the other group of people would spread the problems out on the table that they were working on , we will call these people `` spreaders .",
    "'' spreaders were less likely to put a problem in multiple categories , deciding that making a new category was a better decision than putting a problem into two piles . as a result",
    "a spreader s groups tend to be small and exclusive .",
    "we now create a distance metric as a microscopic measure to compare two sorters to each other .",
    "there are several existing distance metrics that will compare two different sortings , including statistical indices such as the rand index  @xcite which can be converted into a distance metric .",
    "however , in searching for existing statistical methods that will work for our categorization exercise , we found none that obeyed the rules of our `` categorization game , '' especially the third rule .",
    "the rand index merely counts the number of `` agreements . ''",
    "this may be calculated for any two categorizations .",
    "however similarity indicies that are not corrected for chance agreements are not as reliable for creating a sort of measuring stick for measuring a `` distance '' between two categorizations @xcite .",
    "for this reason @xcite created an adjustment to the rand index .",
    "however this adjustment requires that the sub - groups are _ disjoint _ , eliminating any utility that the adjusted rand index has for our study and other similar studies which allow multiple categorization .",
    "this story may be repeated for any one of the other statistical indicies that we could find in the statistics literature , and after some consideration , we decided that we needed to invent a new method for analyzing this type of data .",
    "our distance metric will bypass this difficulty as it is a direct distance metric and not a similarity index .",
    "the distance metric is determined by considering the weighted adjacency matrix for each reviewer , and it compares any two graphs generated by two reviewers as long as they have the same number of nodes ( which they would for identical card sets ) .",
    "each element of the weighted adjacency matrix @xmath31 for each reviewer @xmath32 is : @xmath33 the distance metric is : @xmath34 our distance metric may be interpreted as the number of edges that need to be added to and removed from one graph to make it identical to another .",
    "the factor of @xmath35 is included due to the symmetry of the weighted adjacency matrix . in order to be a statistical distance metric ,",
    "the distance @xmath36 between any two categorizations @xmath31 and @xmath37 must satisfy a few properties : @xmath38    appendix [ proof ] contains a brief proof that our metric satisfies these properties .",
    "we can use this distance metric to create a symmetric matrix where the distance between sorter @xmath12 and @xmath13 appears in row @xmath12 and column @xmath13 .",
    "the distance matrix we constructed answers the question  how far is sorter @xmath12 from sorter @xmath13 ? \" for every pair of sorters .",
    "since we have 41 sorters , this matrix operates in a 41-dimensional space , which is of course impossible to visualize .",
    "principal component analysis ( pca ) is a way of reducing high dimensional data back down to something more manageable .",
    "pca is a general term in the statistical community describing a number of techniques involving the singular value decomposition . to visualize our data , we did a singular value decomposition on the distance matrix . by applying the singular value decomposition to the distance matrix",
    "we perform a change of base so that the largest amount of variation is in the first principal component ( pc1 ) , the second largest amount of variation is in the second principal component ( pc2 ) , and each subsequent component explains less variation than the previous component .",
    "this analysis is then projected out onto fewer spatial dimensions , using only the most influential base vectors as a new reduced base .",
    "if this method is successful , the majority of variation can be explained with just a few components . in our case , taking just the first two components explains approximately 87% of the variability in our dataset .",
    "we thus focus on this reduced - dimension pca , which can easily be visualized in figure  [ pca ] .",
    "we can now visualize our sorters and easily interpret what we see .",
    "the question of what sorter characteristic results in what behavior of pc1 and pc2 is lost in a 41-dimensional rotation and subsequent projection . in other words",
    ", this abstract representation of microscopic data ( the distance matrix strongly depends on problem identities ) does not boil down to a simple linear combination of macroscopic features .    making sense of pc1 and pc2",
    "is where the previous work on graph visualization ( subsection  [ subsec : visualize ] ) and analysis ( subsections  [ subsec : numcat ] through  [ subsec : avepath ] ) , combined with the interpretation of the ccm ( subsection  [ subsec : ccm ] ) comes together .",
    "we can look at the relative placement of our sorters by the pca , visually analyze their graphs , and attempt an interpretation of the abstract sources of variation found by the pca .",
    "the expert and novice identity of each sorter is a variable known only to us and not a factor in determining the placement of the sorters by the pca    analyzing the sorters in order of increasing pc1-coordinate ( fig .",

    "in other words , most variance in the data is not related to the expert or novice identity of the sorters . instead ,",
    "when analyzing the graphs associated with the subjects , it turns out that pc1 mostly reflects the `` stacker '' versus `` spreader '' behavior identified through our ccm ( subsection  [ subsec : ccm ] ) , which is quite independent of being an expert or a novice . based on this result , one could argue that card-_sorting _",
    "experiments most strongly measure how individuals _ sort _ , and may thus be more reflecting of what that individual s office or the file system of his or her personal computer looks like than whether or not he or she is a physics expert .",
    "the expert / novice distinction only shows up in pc2 .",
    "going along the pc2-axis in the left panel of figure  [ pca ] , one finds more experts with a high pc2 and more novices with a low pc2 . _",
    "why _ that is can not be answered at this point and is the subject of further research in our group .",
    "in our endeavor to study the categorization behavior of experts and novices , we have developed a method for analyzing expert and novice categorizations . in the process , we have gained insight into different human cognitive structures . rather than focusing on qualitative differences in category names , we chose to focus on the groupings of problems . in order to do this",
    "we have created a method for converting an abstract categorization into a graph , which may then be analyzed . this conversion has laid the foundation for our method of analyzing card - sorting experiments , which is applicable in any experiment where sorters may put any single card into more than one category , a behavior which we name multiple categorization .    using experimental data",
    ", we confirmed the null - results that experts and novices are not distinguishable based on macroscopic features of their card - sorting such as the number of categories .",
    "this held true even when employing graph theoretical approaches . finding these null result when comparing categorizations macroscopic properties , we created the cognitive categorization model , which provided insight into the general sorter behavior .",
    "we found that the best fitting ccm had a multiple categorization probability that depended on the number of categories which led us to determine that sorters tended toward `` stacking '' or `` spreading '' when sorting physics problems .",
    "a stacker tended to create a few general categories and multiply categorize more often .",
    "a spreader tended to create many specific categories and multiply categorize less often .",
    "this stacker vs.  spreader behavior is quite independent of the expert vs.  novice distinction between our sorters .",
    "as macroscopic properties did not differentiate expert from novice , we studied the microscopic properties of categorizations in creating our distance metric .",
    "this distance metric compares sorters categorizations in a manner which takes problem identity into account . in order to visualize the relative position of our sorters as measured by our distance metric",
    ", we employed principal components analysis .",
    "this allowed us to confirm the stacker vs.  spreader distinction as the largest source of variation among sorters .",
    "it also fortuitously found the distinction between experts and novices as the second largest source of variation .",
    "in future studies , we will continue the process of making sense of the source of variation in the second principal component . as the distance metric is sensitive to the identity of the problems",
    ", we plan to study the effects of including only a subset of problems from our original categorization set on the principal components analysis . ongoing work in our lab",
    "has shown that the expert / novice distinction is highly sensitive to the problems selected .",
    "there are some subsets of problems where the expert / novice distinction is stark and many others where this distinction is non - existent . in the future",
    ", we will be looking at the properties of the problems which cause this high level of differentiation with the goal of understanding what `` rigging '' must occur in order to observe this stark distinction with a high degree of certainty .",
