    "the famous onsager s solution @xcite of the square lattice ising model was the first essential result in the field of two - dimensional quantum integrable statistical lattice models .",
    "the next step was made by lieb @xcite who used the bethe ansatz @xcite to solve different partial cases of the six - vertex model .",
    "his results were generalized to the general case of the six - vertex model by sutherland @xcite .",
    "later , baxter proposed the method of functional relations @xcite to solve statistical models which can not be treated with the help of the bethe ansatz .",
    "the method works for the cases where the bethe ansatz can be applied as well .",
    "it appears that its main ingredients , transfer matrices and @xmath1-operators , are essential not only for the integration of the corresponding quantum statistical models in the sense of calculating the partition function in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one of the remarkable recent applications is their usage in the construction of the fermionic basis @xcite for the observables of the xxz spin chain closely related to the six - vertex model .",
    "it seems that the most productive , although not comprehensive , modern approach to the theory of quantum integrable systems is the approach based on the concept of quantum group invented by drinfeld and jimbo @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "all the objects describing the model and related to its integrability originate from the universal @xmath2-matrix , and the functional relations are consequences of the properties of the appropriate representations of the quantum group .",
    "it was clearly realized by bazhanov , lukyanov and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "the present paper can be considered as an introduction to the application of the theory of quantum groups to formulation of integrable systems and derivation of the corresponding functional relations .",
    "we were prompted to write it by the absence of a detailed and exhaustive consideration of the method in the literature .",
    "one more reason was a desire to fix the terminology and notations for our future research .    in section [ s : slvm ] ,",
    "we discuss the original approach to formulation and investigation of quantum square lattice vertex models .",
    "we introduce basic objects , and for the case of the six - vertex model reproduce the baxter s reasonings for the appearance of the functional relations . in section [ s : odurm ] , all the objects describing an integrable lattice vertex model and used to integrate it are constructed starting from a quantum group .",
    "two representations of the quantum group should be fixed to describe a model . here , particularly by historical reasons ,",
    "the corresponding representation spaces are called the auxiliary space and the quantum space . in most cases",
    "there is an associated quantum mechanical model defined in the quantum space or its tensor power .",
    "in fact , a lattice model arises when we take finite - dimensional representations , and the associated quantum mechanical model here is some spin chain .",
    "the basic example here is the six - vertex model and xxz spin chain , see , for example , the book by baxter @xcite .",
    "if the quantum space is the representation space of certain infinite - dimensional vertex representation of the quantum group , we have a two - dimensional field theory @xcite . in section [",
    "s : e ] we consider the case of the quantum group @xmath0 .",
    "the full set of functional relation in the universal form independent of the choice of representation of the quantum group in the quantum space is derived in section [ s : fr ] .",
    "we assume that the reader is acquainted with the basic facts on quantum groups . beside the original papers @xcite ,",
    "we recommend for this purpose the book by chari and pressley  @xcite .",
    "below , a vector space is a vector space over the field @xmath3 of complex numbers , and an algebra is a complex associative unital algebra .",
    "in fact , all general definitions , given in section [ s : odurm ] , can easily be extended to the case of algebras and vector spaces over a general field or even a general commutative unital ring .",
    "the symbol ` @xmath4 ' is used for the tensor product of vector spaces , for the tensor product of homomorphisms and for the kronecker product of matrices .",
    "depending on the context , the symbol ` @xmath5 ' means the number one , the unit of an algebra or the unit matrix .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the loop lie algebra of a finite - dimensional simple lie algebra @xmath7 , by @xmath8 its standard central extension , and by @xmath9 the lie algebra obtained from @xmath8 by adjoining the standard derivation , see , for example , the book by kac @xcite .",
    "here we recall the basic facts on integrable two - dimensional square lattice vertex models and show how functional relations arise in the case of the six - vertex model .",
    "first of all , the models in question are quantum statistical models whose properties in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium are described by the partition function .",
    "label by @xmath10 the possible eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the system under consideration and denote by @xmath11 the corresponding energy .",
    "the partition function is @xmath12 where @xmath13 with @xmath14 the boltzmann constant and @xmath15 the temperature .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is called the boltzmann weight of the configuration @xmath10 .    consider now a two - dimensional square lattice , see figure [ lattice ] ,        and assume that some particles are located at its vertices .",
    "any horizontal bond of the lattice can be in one of @xmath17 states , and a vertical bond in one of @xmath18 states .",
    "this defines a configuration of the system .",
    "usually one also imposes boundary conditions .",
    "the simplest case here is the periodic boundary condition , where for each horizontal and vertical row the state of the first bond coincides with the state of the last bond .",
    "the energy of a configuration is the sum of the energies associated with the vertices .",
    "the energy @xmath19 associated with a vertex @xmath20 depends on the vertex itself and on the configuration @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath21 assume that @xmath19 depends only on the states of the bonds connecting @xmath20 with the neighboring vertices .",
    "we label the states of the horizontal and vertical bonds by the integers from @xmath5 to @xmath17 and from @xmath5 to @xmath18 respectively , and denote the energy associated with a vertex by @xmath22 , where the indices correspond to the states of the bonds as is shown in figure  [ vertex ] .",
    "@xmath23    it is convenient to introduce the boltzmann weight of a vertex @xmath24 it is clear that the boltzmann weight of a configuration is the product of the boltzmann weights of the vertices , and the summation over the configurations is the summation over the indices associated with the bonds",
    ". one can start with the summation over the indices associated with the horizontal bonds of a row excluding the first and the last bonds .",
    "this gives the quantities @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of the vertices in a horizontal row .",
    "now we sum over the states of the remaining bonds of a horizontal row .",
    "if we assume the periodic boundary conditions , we should put in equation ( [ maibj ] ) @xmath27 and sum over @xmath28 .",
    "more generally , one can multiply ( [ maibj ] ) by some quantities @xmath29 and sum over @xmath28 and @xmath30 independently .",
    "this can be considered as a generalization of boundary conditions called quasi - periodic or twisted . as the result",
    "we obtain the quantities @xmath31 which can be graphically interpreted by figure [ transfer ] , where @xmath32 and the summation over the indices associated with the internal lines is implied .    .",
    "]    define a @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 called the transfer matrix .",
    "it is clear that the summation over the states of the horizontal bonds of two adjacent horizontal rows and over the states of the vertical bonds between them gives the entries of the matrix @xmath35 .",
    "summing over the states of the horizontal bonds of all horizontal rows and over the states of the vertical bonds between them we obtain the entries of the matrix @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of the horizontal rows . assuming the purely periodic boundary conditions for the vertical rows we see that the summation over the states of the remaining bonds gives the trace of this matrix .",
    "thus , we come to the equation @xmath38 recall that the statistical physics describes systems of large numbers of particles . hence , we are primarily interested in the case of large @xmath26 and @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath39 is the maximal eigenvalue of the transfer matrix @xmath40 and it is nondegenerate , then for large @xmath37 we have the estimation @xmath41 therefore , the problem of calculating the partition function is reduced to the problem of finding the maximal eigenvalue of the transfer matrix for large @xmath26 . in some cases",
    "it can be done using the bethe ansatz or some its modification .",
    "in fact , the applicability of the bethe ansatz is a manifestation of a rich algebraic structure behind the model under consideration . to reveal this structure , it is useful to introduce spectral parameters associated with the rows and columns of the lattice , see figure [ parameters ] ,        and assume that the boltzmann weight of a vertex depends on the corresponding row and column spectral parameters .",
    "so we write @xmath42 for the transfer operator .",
    "the case @xmath43 is called homogeneous .      the vertex model under consideration",
    "is said to be integrable if we have @xmath44 = 0 \\label{ttcomm}\\ ] ] for any @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it follows from this equation that the transfer matrix @xmath47 .",
    "one can show that equation ( [ ttcomm ] ) is valid , in particular , if there exist @xmath48 quantities @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 the model possesses the richest algebraic structure if additionally @xmath52 this is the famous yang - baxter equation .",
    "the standard example of a quantum statistical vertex model is the six - vertex model . here",
    "any horizontal and vertical bond can be in one of two states labelled by @xmath5 and @xmath53 , and the boltzmann weights @xmath54 can be arranged into the matrix @xmath55 where @xmath56 and we order the pairs of indices as @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is a fixed nonzero complex number .",
    "we see that the boltzmann weights are different from zero only for six vertex configurations , hence the name of the model .",
    "equation ( [ rmm ] ) is satisfied with @xmath62 the usual choice for @xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an arbitrary complex number .",
    "one can verify that ( [ rff ] ) is satisfied .    to find eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the transfer matrix it is convenient to use the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "this approach shows that there are the eigenvectors of the transfer matrix with the eigenvalues @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and @xmath45 ,  , @xmath68 satisfy the bethe equations @xmath69 it can be shown that all eigenvalues can be obtained by the bethe ansatz , and that the corresponding eigenvectors form a basis of @xmath70 , see , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is important that these eigenvectors do not depend on @xmath71 , that is in fact a consequence of equation ( [ ttcomm ] ) .",
    "now it is clear that there is a matrix @xmath72 such that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a diagonal matrix .    for a given solution of the bethe equations we define the function @xmath75 where the dependence of the bethe roots @xmath45 ,  , @xmath68 on the spectral parameters @xmath76 , ",
    ", @xmath77 is shown explicitly .",
    "now we can rewrite relation ( [ lambda ] ) as @xmath78    the matrix @xmath79 in ( [ oto ] ) is a diagonal matrix with entries being the eigenvalues of @xmath42 of the form ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "denote by @xmath80 the diagonal matrix whose entries are the corresponding functions @xmath81 given by  ( [ theta ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ lambdatheta ] ) that @xmath82 define the matrix @xmath83 since the matrix @xmath80 does not depend on @xmath71 , it follows from ( [ tdqd ] ) that @xmath84 this functional equation is called the baxter s @xmath85-equation . by construction , we also have @xmath86 = 0 , \\label{tqcomm } \\\\[.5em ] [ \\bbq(\\zeta_1 | \\eta_1 , \\ldots , \\eta_n ) , \\bbq(\\zeta_2 | \\eta_1 , \\ldots , \\eta_n ) ] = 0 \\label{qqcomm}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for any @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we call ( [ ttcomm ] ) , ( [ tqcomm ] ) , ( [ qqcomm ] ) and ( [ tq ] ) functional relations .",
    "they are equivalent to the bethe ansatz in the sense that they can be used to find the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix , see , for example , the book @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we explain how the objects necessary for the integration of an integrable model are related to its background algebraic structure .",
    "in this section @xmath87 is a @xmath88-graded quasitriangular hopf algebra over the field @xmath3 with the comultiplication @xmath89 and the universal @xmath2-matrix @xmath90 .",
