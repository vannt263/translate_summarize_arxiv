    "a randomly switched system has two ingredients , namely , a family of subsystems and a random switching signal . in this article",
    "we are interested in finding conditions for stochastic stability of randomly switched systems .",
    "our approach consists of identifying key properties of the family of subsystems and the switching signal , and finding conditions to connect them such that the switched system has the desired characteristics .",
    "we concentrate on stability almost surely and in expectation .",
    "since each of these implies stability in probability  @xcite , our results immediately provide sufficient conditions for weak stability in probability of the systems under consideration ; we also demonstrate that the conditions are sufficient for strong stability in probability .",
    "the basic structure of our main analysis results is as follows .",
    "the first step involves extracting properties which quantitatively express stability characteristics of the subsystems .",
    "this is carried out with the help of multiple lyapunov functions .",
    "the method of multiple lyapunov functions was developed originally in the context of deterministic switched systems , and is discussed in detail in , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  3 ) .",
    "this method is effective in quantitatively capturing the degree of stability ( or instability ) of the subsystems .",
    "the second step involves extracting key properties of the switching signal .",
    "these properties are variously captured by the probability mass function of its rate of switching , the probability distribution of its jump destinations , distribution of holding times between switching instants , etc .",
    "finally , the characteristics of the switched system generated by the switching signal from the family of subsystems are captured by inequalities which connect the above two sets of properties .",
    "research on randomly switched systems has concentrated mostly on the case of markovian switching signals  the discrete state evolves according to a continuous - time markov chain ; see e.g. ,  @xcite and the references cited therein . the central idea behind arriving at",
    "stability conditions revolves around employing the generator of the markov process and extracting certain nonnegative supermartingales that converge to zero in expectation .",
    "this method in turn is based on the martingale problem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  5 ) corresponding to the markov process . in its simplest form ,",
    "if @xmath0 is the underlying markov process with generator @xmath1 , ( @xmath2 consists of both the continuous and the discrete states , ) then for every measurable and bounded real - valued function @xmath3 on the state space , the process @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 is a martingale . a pointwise inequality which bounds @xmath6 on the state space may be imposed , and with the help of this one can draw conclusions about stability properties of the system by analyzing the martingale above ; this analysis becomes particularly simple if @xmath3 is a nonnegative lyapunov - like function .",
    "the martingale approach described above can be applied to switched systems in which the switching signals are general point processes with intensity functions satisfying certain standard measurability conditions ; see e.g. ,  @xcite for further details on the measurability conditions .",
    "these intensity functions appear in the expression of @xmath7 in place of the usual markov transition intensity matrix , and hereafter the analysis follows that of the markovian case .",
    "however , for non - markovian switching signals , it is not easy to employ this technique ; for instance , if the holding times between consecutive switching instants are independent and identical uniform random variables , obtaining expressions of these intensity functions is difficult .",
    "the methods we propose here apply to semi - markovian switching signals , do not depend on martingale analysis , and arrive at the results directly by employing what we think are less involved and more intuitively appealing techniques .",
    "existing work on stability of stochastic switched systems includes  @xcite ; see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  1 ) for a survey techniques employed in these articles .",
    "analysis results obtained via our approach , including those reported in our earlier article  @xcite where each subsystem was required to be stable , have conceptual analogs in deterministic switched systems theory .",
    "the approach pursued in  @xcite and in the current article is derived from the method of multiple lyapunov functions developed in the context of deterministic switched systems , see e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  3 ) for an extensive discussion . stability of individual subsystems and a slow switching condition are the important features of these deterministic results . in this article",
    "our results involving unstable subsystems employ certain probabilistic characteristics of the switching signal in addition to slow switching ; their conceptual analogs in deterministic switched systems literature are comparatively less known , with the exception of  @xcite .    with our analysis results in hand",
    ", we turn to control synthesis and derive explicit controller formulas which ensure stability of the switched system in closed loop . in this context , there naturally arise two distinct cases : one in which the controller has full knowledge of the switching signal at each instant of time , and the other in which the controller is totally unaware of the switching signal .",
    "we examine the distinctive features of each of these two cases and propose control synthesis strategies by employing _ universal formulae _",
    "@xcite for nonlinear feedback stabilization .",
    "the advantages of our approach are evident here , for one does not need to design a controller separately for the switched system if there already exist _ control - lyapunov functions _ for each individual subsystem ; then , off - the - shelf controllers employing universal formulae are easily designed , and a modular organization of the controller synthesis stage is facilitated .",

    "indeed , it may so happen that for a given @xmath111 , a fixed probability distribution @xmath112 , and a choice of functions @xmath75 , ( e3 ) and ( e4 ) may be impossible to satisfy simultaneously , due to a very high degree of instability of even one subsystem for which the corresponding @xmath113 is also large",
    ". then we need to search for a different family of functions @xmath75 for which the hypotheses hold .",
    "thirdly , ( e4 ) connects the properties of deterministic subsystem dynamics , furnished by the family of lyapunov functions satisfying assumption  [ a : v ] , with the properties of the stochastic switching signal . from ( e4 ) it is clear that larger degrees of instability of a subsystem ( small @xmath107 ) can be compensated by a smaller probability of the switching signal activating the corresponding subsystem .",

    "* section  20.4 ) .",
    "there is a strong dependence on past history due to the uniform holding times .",
    "indeed , at an arbitrary instant of time @xmath114 we need to know how long ago the last jump occurred in order to compute the probability distribution of the next jump instant after @xmath114 .",
    "[ r : comppoissonunif ] it may be observed that theorem  [ t : gasaspoisson ] requires a larger set of hypotheses compared to theorem  [ t : gasasunif ] ; however , this is only natural .",
    "indeed , the switching signal in the latter case is constrained to switch at least once in @xmath115 units of time , whereas no such hard constraint is present on the switching signal in the former case .",
    "we observed in remark  [ r : theorempoisson ] that it is necessary for the switching signal to switch fast enough if there are unstable subsystems in the family  , which necessitated the condition ( e3 ) .",
    "this fast switching is automatic if @xmath24 is of class uh , provided @xmath115 is related to the instability margin of the subsystems in a particular way .",
    "the condition ( u3 ) captures this relationship , for , observe that if @xmath107 is negative and large in magnitude for some @xmath20 , the ratio @xmath116 is smaller for smaller @xmath115 , and a smaller ratio is better for gas  a.s .  of  . also for a given @xmath115 , large and positive @xmath107 s ( i.e. , subsystems with high margins of stability ) make the aforesaid ratio small .",
    "the results in   [ s : mainres ] fall short of being completely satisfactory . in particular , the assumption of the jump destinations process @xmath117 being memoryless ( assumptions ( eh2 ) and ( uh2 ) ) is perhaps the most restrictive . as we observed in remark  [ r : theoremunif ] , switching signals of class uh fall in the class of semi - markov processes , in fact trivially so , due to the memoryless nature of the discrete jump - destination process @xmath117 .",
