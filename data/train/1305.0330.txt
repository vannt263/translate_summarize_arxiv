    "graphene is the first experimentally - realizable stable true atomic monolayer .",

    "after its discovery , physical properties of graphene became the subject of intense scientific efforts .",
    "in addition to single - layer graphene , bilayer graphene is also actively studied .",
    "this interest is driven by the desire to extend the family of graphene - like materials and to create materials with a gap in the electronic spectrum , which could be of interest for applications .",
    "bilayer graphene exists in two stacking modifications .",
    "the most common is the so - called bernal , or ab , stacking of graphene bilayers ( ab - blg ) .",
    "in such a stacking , half of the carbon atoms in the top layer are located above the hexagon centers in the lower layer ; and half of the atoms in the top layer lie above the atoms in the lower layer . a different layer arrangement , in which carbon atoms in the upper layer are located on top of the equivalent atoms of the bottom layer , is referred to as aa - stacked graphene bilayer ( aa - blg ) , fig .  [ aablg ] .",
    "so far , the most efforts have been focused on studying the ab - blg  @xcite , for which high - quality samples are available  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the experimental realization of the aa - blg has been also reported  @xcite . however , aa - blg received limited amount of theoretical attention @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding analysis shows that both aa and ab - blgs have four bands ( two hole bands and two electron bands ) .",
    "however , the structure of these bands is different . in the undoped ab - blg , two bands ( one hole band and one electron band )",
    "touch each other at two fermi points , and the low - energy band dispersion is nearly parabolic  @xcite .",
    "the aa - blg has two bands near the fermi energy , one electron - like and one hole - like  @xcite .",
    "the low - energy dispersion in the aa - blg is linear , similar to the monolayer graphene . unlike the latter , however , aa - blg have fermi surfaces instead of fermi points",
    ".    an important feature of the aa - blg is that the hole and electron fermi surfaces coincide in the undoped material .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that these degenerate fermi surfaces are unstable when an arbitrarily weak electron interaction is present , and the bilayer becomes an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator with a finite electron gap .",
    "this electronic instability is strongest when the bands cross at the fermi level .",
    "doping shifts the fermi level and suppresses the afm instability  @xcite . assuming a homogeneous ground state , here we demonstrate that the afm gap @xmath0 decreases when the doping @xmath1 grows , and vanishes for dopings above some critical value @xmath2 .",
    "however , the homogeneously - doped state , depending on temperature and doping , may become unstable with respect to phase separation into an undoped afm insulator and a doped metal  @xcite . in the phase - separated state ,",
    "the concentration of the afm insulator decreases when doping increases . above a certain threshold value of doping @xmath3 , the insulator - to - metal transition occurs .",

    "similar behavior was predicted theoretically for quarter - filled hubbard model at moderate interaction strength  @xcite , and numerically for classical rotor model  @xcite .",
    "in our discussion above we implicitly assumed that the ground state of the aa - blg is spatially homogeneous .",
    "however , this is not always true : it was predicted in ref .   that there is a finite doping range where the aa - blg separates in two phases with unequal electron densities @xmath205 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath119 we can use eq .   and obtain that @xmath206 the negative value of the derivative @xmath207 indicates the instability of the homogeneous state toward phase separation  @xcite .",
    "if the possibility of the incommensurate afm is ignored , then a zero - temperature phase separation  @xcite occurs between the afm insulator ( @xmath208 ) and the pm ( @xmath126ev ) or the afm ( @xmath209ev ) metal ( @xmath210 ) . here",
    "we study phase separation taking into account the incommensurate afm phase and non - zero temperature .",
    "we numerically analyze the stability of the homogeneous state using the dependence of the chemical potential @xmath22 on the doping @xmath1 .",

    "the derivative @xmath207 is negative in some range of doping and the system separates in commensurate ( @xmath179 , @xmath212 ) and incommensurate ( @xmath213 , @xmath214 ) afm phases .",
    "the doping concentrations @xmath215 and @xmath216 are found using the maxwell construction  @xcite : the ( black ) horizontal line is drawn in such a manner that the areas of the shaded regions in fig .",

    "in this paper we study the evolution of the electron properties of aa - blg with doping @xmath1 and temperature @xmath128 .",

    "this diagram includes regions of the afm commensurate and incommensurate states , a region of phase separation , and the pm state . with good accuracy ,",
    "the electronic properties of the aa - blg are symmetric with respect to the electron ( @xmath98 ) or hole ( @xmath191 ) doping .",
    "the maximum crossover temperature between the short - range afm and the pm states depends on the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath59 .",
    "for example , afm ordering can exist up to temperatures of about 50  k if @xmath100ev and to temperatures much higher than room temperature if @xmath222ev . at present , there is no consensus on the value of the on - site coulomb repulsion in graphene - based materials .",
    "however , it is commonly accepted that @xmath59 lies is in the range @xmath223ev and , consequently , the afm state can be observed in the aa - blg .",
    "the critical doping value @xmath2 , at which the afm is replaced by the pm , also strongly depends on @xmath59 , changing from @xmath224% if @xmath100ev to @xmath225% if @xmath180ev . for graphene systems , doping of about @xmath226 and even higher",

    "similar to single - layered graphene , the aa - blg can be doped by using appropriate dopants  @xcite , choosing the substrate and applying a gate voltage  @xcite , or by combinations of these methods .",
    "we predict the existence of phase separation in the aa - blg .",
    "the separated phases have different electron concentrations , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , and the phase separation will be frustrated by long - range coulomb repulsion  @xcite . in this case",
    "the formation of nano - scale inhomogeneities is more probable .",
    "the electron - rich phase ( incommensurate afm ) is metal and the electron - poor phase ( commensurate afm insulator if @xmath105 ) is insulator or `` bad '' metal .",
    "thus , the percolative insulator - metal transition will occur when the doping @xmath1 exceeds some threshold value  @xcite , which is about @xmath227 in 2d systems .",
    "phase separation exists in the doping range @xmath217 , and @xmath228% for any value of @xmath59 . depending on @xmath59 , phase separation",
    "could be observed from 30 - 40  k to room and even higher temperatures ( see fig .  [ figphdiagt ] ) .",
    "this makes aa - blg promising for applications .",
    "the incommensurate afm phase is mathematically equivalent to the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov state in superconductors  @xcite , which is sensitive to disorder  @xcite and difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "consequently , it is reasonable to expect that the incommensurate afm phase can be destroyed by factors our study did not account for .",
    "our calculations predict that in this case the region of phase separation changes only slightly in the phase diagram .",
    "however , the separated phases would be the afm insulator and pm ( @xmath126ev ) of afm metal ( @xmath209ev ) .",
    "to conclude , we studied the phase diagram of the aa - stacked graphene bilayers on the doping  temperature plane .",
    "it consists of paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic ( both commensurate and incommensurate ) homogeneous phases .",
