    "note that this method can only handle fully occupied valence levels at present .",

    "only this last part is different in the present case . due to the renormalization condition ( [ 2.11 ] ) , it depends on the parameter @xmath48 , @xmath85 the cutoff dependent term cancels exactly the logarithmic divergence in the sum over single particle energies . only the last term in eq .",

    "we find it useful to switch from the parameter @xmath48 to @xmath101 by means of eq .",
    "( [ 3.9 ] ) , @xmath102 and to expand @xmath90 and @xmath92 into taylor series in @xmath101 , @xmath103 the euler - lagrange equations corresponding to the effective action ( [ 4.3 ] ) can then be solved analytically with the nnnlo results ( @xmath104 ) @xmath105 the baryon mass becomes @xmath106 as the whole winding number of @xmath90 resides in the lo term @xmath107 , baryon number is always 1/2 .",
    "therefore the complex potential @xmath108 traces out half a turn around the chiral circle .",
    "this is confirmed by plotting @xmath81 and @xmath53 , showing kink - like behavior of @xmath81 like in the massless gn model , see fig .  2 . the presence of a non - vanishing @xmath53 signals that we are dealing with a new kind of solitonic baryon here which did not show up yet in any other variant of the gn model family .",
    "let us now turn to periodic solutions of the euler - lagrange equations in the derivative expansion .",
    "they are expected to approximate systematically the ground state of matter at low densities and in the vicinity of the chiral limit @xmath50 .",

    "starting point is the divergence of the axial current in the generalized gn model @xmath122 where we have taken a ground state expectation value and used large @xmath0 factorization .",
    "owing to the properties @xmath123 specific for 1 + 1 dimensions , we get for stationary states @xmath124 twofold integration for the baryon case then leads to a sum rule relating baryon number directly to an integral over the hf potentials @xmath125 , @xmath126 in the last step , partial integration was used . inserting the results for @xmath125 from the baryon , i.e. , @xmath127 with @xmath128 from eqs .",

    "instead we break it by choosing two slightly different coupling constants in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels .",
    "the central quantity of interest is the grand canonical potential which differs in these two cases only by the double counting correction .",

    "in this paper , we have studied a generalization of the gn model with two different ( scalar and pseudoscalar ) coupling constants .",
    "this equips us with an  interpolating field theory \" between the well - studied massless gn and njl@xmath3 models in a way which always keeps the discrete z@xmath3 chiral symmetry intact .",
    "the continuous chiral symmetry of the njl@xmath3 model is only recovered for equal coupling constants , so that we now break chiral symmetry ( explicitly ) in a quite different manner than via the usual fermion mass term .",
    "our motivation was primarily to get further insights into the solitonic aspects of 4-fermion theories in 1 + 1 dimensions which have been investigated intensely in recent years .",
    "the first insight is the emergence of the dimensionless parameter @xmath48 during the process of regularization and renormalization , in addition to the familiar fermion mass .",
    "the basic relations , eqs .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) , which generalize the standard gap equation remove all divergences encountered in subsequent applications , both in the treatment of bound states ( mesons , baryons ) and in the thermodynamics of the model .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 plays a role analogous to the  confinement parameter \" @xmath276 in massive gn models .",
    "this is particularly striking in the rpa approach to the pseudoscalar fermion - antifermion bound and scattering states , where the results for the massive njl@xmath3 model and the generalized gn model become identical if we replace @xmath276 by @xmath48 .",
    "the qualitative effect of @xmath48 on the hf calculations at zero and finite temperature is very easy to understand .",
    "it only enters in the double counting correction to energy or thermodynamic potential as an extra term @xmath277 .",
    "hence it acts like a lagrange multiplier for the pseudoscalar potential , leading to a complete quenching of @xmath53 in the gn limit @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath48 may be thought of as a ",
    "chiral quenching parameter \" responsible for the transition from complex condensates living on the chiral circle in the njl@xmath3 model to the purely real condensates of the gn model .",
    "as far as baryon structure is concerned , the most interesting result is perhaps the fact that the new baryons interpolate between the kink of the gn model and the massless baryon of the njl@xmath3 model , always carrying fractional baryon number 1/2 .",
    "this is certainly a consequence of the fact that the generalized gn model still has a discrete chiral symmetry . indeed in the massive njl@xmath3 model , chiral symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken by the mass term without a residual z@xmath3 symmetry and one finds baryons with integer baryon number 1 .",
    "this new kind of chiral kink is different from all known multi - fermion bound states in the gn model family and has been determined analytically for small @xmath48 and numerically for large @xmath48 .",
    "the phase diagrams of the njl@xmath3 and gn model look very different , so that we were curious to see how our theory would manage to interpolate between these two pictures .",
    "this can now be answered most clearly by the study of the tricritical behavior near the chiral limit , largely analytically owing to the gl approach .",
    "the relevant picture is fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , showing a kind of  morphing \" from gn - type behavior to the njl@xmath3 phase diagram with its single straight line phase boundary . together with the numerical hf calculation , we are now confident that the solitonic crystal phase is separated from the massless ( massive ) fermi gas by a 2nd ( 1st ) order transition , respectively .",
    "this was not clear a priori , since the transition from the crystal to the massive homogeneous phase is continuous in the gn model and does nt even exist in the njl@xmath3 model .",
    "our interpolated phase diagram also looks qualitatively different from the one of the massive njl@xmath3 model which has only 2 phases ( no massless phase due to explicit breaking of the z@xmath3 symmetry ) , and where the opening angle between the 2 phase boundaries at the tricritical point was @xmath67 rather than 0 .",
    "initially , we had hoped that the generalized gn model can be solved analytically for arbitrary @xmath48 , since this is what happens at the  endpoints \" @xmath50 ( njl@xmath3 ) and @xmath278 ( gn ) . however , this does not seem to be the case .",
    "in this situation , the fact that our toolbox also contains the numerical hf method has turned out to be a definite advantage .",
    "a combination of analytical calculations and a numerical approach gives us confidence that we have solved and understood the model in the large @xmath0 limit fairly well .",
    "the most serious limitation at present is the fact that our techniques are tailored to point - like 4-fermion interactions and can not deal with gauge theories in a systematic fashion .",
    "this is unfortunate in view of the interesting features of , e.g. , the t  hooft model @xcite where more analytical insights into the early @xcite and very recent @xcite numerical hf calculations on the lattice would be welcome .",
