    "the present global pdf analyses ( e.g.  nnpdf3.0  @xcite , mmht2014  @xcite , ct14  @xcite ) find that there is a large uncertainty in the low @xmath3 behaviour of the gluon distribution .",
    "there is a lack of very low @xmath3 data , particularly at low scales .",
    "moreover , the gluon is determined at low @xmath3 mainly by the dglap evolution of deep inelastic scattering , that is , not from a direct measurement would provide a direct determination , but the data are poor and do not reach low @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the convergence of the perturbative series for @xmath18 is relatively poor . ] , but rather from the derivative @xmath19 .",
    "as a result , at low scales , the uncertainty on the gluon pdf is large for @xmath20 . on the other hand , the hera data on diffractive vector meson photoproduction @xcite , @xmath0 and the lhc data on the exclusive processes @xmath21  @xcite where @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and @xmath22  @xcite , sample directly the gluon distribution down to @xmath23 . for a review of exclusive vector - meson production at the lhc see , for example , ref",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , @xmath9 and @xmath2 data are not used in the global pdf analyses .",
    "one reason is that the corresponding cross sections are described by non - diagonal ( skewed ) analogues of the pdfs , namely generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) , due to the different masses of the incoming photon and the outgoing @xmath24 meson  @xcite .",
    "the gpds can be related to the pdfs via the shuvaev transform in the low @xmath5 region  @xcite .",
    "plays the role of the pdf variable @xmath3 and is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the light - cone plus - momenta of the in- and outgoing protons . ] in this work , following @xcite , we make the physically motivated assumption that the input distribution has no singularities in the right - half mellin-@xmath28 plane which implies that this relation holds at nlo to accuracy @xmath29 .",
    "another reason is the dependence of the theoretical predictions on the choice of the factorisation scale , @xmath30 .",
    "this problem has two independent parts .",
    "one part has a technical nature and the other is more physical .",
    "let us discuss them in turn .",
    "first , the ` technical ' problem , which is related to the convergence of the perturbative expansion at low @xmath5 and low scales .",
    "a good illustration is that the nlo amplitude for the exclusive high - energy @xmath31 process  @xcite was shown to yield a cross section which varies by up to an order of magnitude for a reasonable variation of @xmath30 .",
    "this problem was emphasised recently by wagner et al .",
    "the strong scale dependence arises because in the dglap evolution of low @xmath5 gpds the probability of emitting a new gluon is strongly enhanced by the large value of @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , the mean number of gluons in the interval @xmath33 is  @xcite n ( 1/)_f^2 , [ eq : n ] leading to a value of @xmath34 up to about 8 , for the case @xmath35 with the usual @xmath30 scale variation interval from @xmath36 to @xmath37 . in contrast , the nlo coefficient function allows for the emission of only _",
    "one _ gluon .",
    "therefore we can not expect compensation between the contributions coming from the gpd and the coefficient function as we vary the scale @xmath30 .",
    "( at large @xmath5 the compensation is much more complete and provides reasonable stability of the predictions to variations of the scale @xmath30 . ) in section  [ sec : opt ] , we use the nlo contribution to fix a choice of the factorisation scale for the lo part of the amplitude , which allows the @xmath4 corrections to be resummed .",
    "the second or ` physical ' reason why there is a strong scale dependence of @xmath9 and @xmath2 photoproduction is due to ` defects ' in the presently available pdf sets which are obtained in the dglap global analyses of deep inelastic and related hard scattering data .",
    "that is , our studies indicate that there is a strong scale dependence in vector - meson photoproduction caused by the unexpectedly small lo contribution in comparison with the nlo correction .",
    "this occurs due to the very low input gluon density in the low @xmath3 domain obtained in the recent global pdf analyses .",
    "we conclude that at the input scale , the low @xmath3 gluon density is underestimated in comparison with that for quarks .",
    "the crucial observation is that the number of input gluons ( which is parametrised _",
    "freely _ in the global analyses ) is found to be much less than the number of such gluons emitted by quarks  or , to be more precise , gluons associated with the quark ( each quark carries a gluon field created by its colour charge ) . with the present global partons the nlo sea quark contribution to @xmath24 meson photoproduction grows with decreasing @xmath3 faster than the input gluons . as a result , at sufficiently high energy , the quark component of the nlo correction to @xmath24 photoproduction approximately cancels the main lo contribution which is due only to the gluon density .",
    "therefore a small variation of the scale in the nlo component leads to a strong variation of the predicted cross section .",
    "recently the lhcb collaboration have presented data for open charm and beauty production in the forward direction @xcite .",
    "these data sample approximately the same kinematic domain as exclusive vector meson production ; actually the @xmath3 values are slightly larger , and the scale for beauty production is also larger .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the data can be reproduced by nlo qcd using the present global pdfs .",
    "note , however , that again there is a large sensitivity to the choice of factorization scale . indeed , to reproduce the data one needs to take a scale approximately a factor of two larger than the natural choice @xmath38 .",
    "since the optimal or appropriate scale for open heavy - quark production is not known at present , these data do not yet reliably determine the low @xmath3 gluon at low scales .",
    "in the present paper we focus on exclusive vector - meson production .",
    "moreover , our goal is not to present a new global pdf analysis or an explicit determination of the low @xmath3 gluon , but rather to study the possibility to reduce the scale dependence of the prediction , to study the qualitative structure of the nlo amplitude and to give hints of the consequences for the behaviour of the low @xmath3 gluon at low scales .    in section  [ sec : opt ]",
    "we consider the nlo contribution originating from the light quark ( singlet ) gpd .",
    "we show that this part of the nlo amplitude allows us to choose a factorisation scale which sums the @xmath32 enhanced contributions inside the gpd .",
    "the remaining part of the nlo contribution has no large @xmath32 factors , and , as shown in section  [ sec : upsilon ] , the compensation between the scale dependence of the gpds and of the coefficient functions for @xmath2 production makes the nlo result sufficiently stable for the data to be included in global parton analyses ( just as for the predictions of processes at larger @xmath3 ) .",
    "the study of the @xmath9 photoproduction in section  [ sec : j ] suggests that the gluon density obtained in the existing pdf analyses is too small at low @xmath3 and low scale . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "our aim in this section is to show how knowledge of the nlo contribution for @xmath39 allows us to sum the @xmath4 enhanced contributions by a particular choice of @xmath30 in the lo part of the amplitude ( and correspondingly in the nlo coefficient function ) , which , in turn , reduces the factorisation scale dependence of the predicted cross section .",
    "we outline the procedure in section  [ sec : lo ] , but first we comment on the nlo formalism .      the nlo formalism for @xmath40 has been presented in  @xcite . however , before we can apply it to describe the high energy @xmath24 photoproduction data , we must note one important correction .",
    "the lo partonic amplitude , @xmath41 , for the subprocess @xmath42 , can be calculated by considering the fusion of a photon with a pair of on - shell gluons with zero transverse momentum and physical , transverse , polarisations .",
    "if we use dimensional regularisation with @xmath43 ( as in  @xcite ) to regularize the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences , then the result is given , before dividing by the number of physical transverse polarisations of the incoming gluon , by @xmath44 in @xmath45 dimensions , there are @xmath46 possible transverse directions .",
    "since the entire calculation must be performed in @xmath45 dimensions , to properly average over the polarisation of the incoming gluon , we must divide by this factor , and not simply by 2 .",
    "therefore for the lo partonic amplitude we obtain , contrary to  @xcite ( prior to the first erratum ) , @xmath47 the difference of a factor of @xmath48 does not alter the finite lo result ( as @xmath49 is taken to zero ) but does lead to a different nlo result due to the differing counter - terms .",
    "indeed , the extra factor @xmath48 presented in  @xcite generates extra terms @xmath50 in the counter - terms , @xmath51 , giving them a form @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "however , with the lo partonic amplitude we instead obtain counter - terms containing @xmath55 it is precisely this alteration to the counter - terms which leads us to a different nlo finite result .",
    "this result agrees with that of  @xcite with both errata .",
    "the details of our recalculation of the nlo result will be published separately  @xcite .",
    "here we simply state the final result for the high - energy limit of the nlo part of the amplitude . in the high - energy approximation , @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the c.m .",
    "energy of the incoming @xmath58 system and @xmath59 the mass of the vector meson ) , the imaginary part of the amplitude dominates and the leading contribution to the nlo correction comes from the region @xmath60 .",

    ", we have to calculate the feynman diagrams assuming that the charm / bottom - quark line has mass @xmath81 where @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "one can see directly from the high energy , leading @xmath4 , limit , given in , that for the choice @xmath83 the asymptotic limit of the quark nlo contribution vanishes .",
    "it is this observation that will allow us ( in section  [ sec : nlo ] ) to claim that a suitable value for the factorisation scale in leading logarithm terms is @xmath84 .    before we show how the nlo contribution allows us to fix the scale @xmath30 in the lo term , it is informative to first recall its structure and introduce the notation in terms of the lo prediction .",
    "we start with the lo contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "it is sketched in fig .",

    "the coefficient function @xmath87 is calculated using the non - relativistic vector meson wave function . in general , the relativistic corrections are not small for the @xmath9 case .",
    "these corrections should be considered together with the three parton ( @xmath88 ) component of the wave function ; that is , accounting for the rle of gluons which provide the interaction between charm quarks . for this process",
    ", it was shown by hoodbhoy  @xcite that the consistent treatment of relativistic corrections may , to good accuracy , be effectively accounted for by choosing , in the non - relativistic formula , the charm quark mass @xmath89 .. this limit simplifies the calculation , but inspection of the proof indicates that the statement about a small relativistic correction should be reliable below this limit as well . ] after this , the remaining part of the correction is quite small ( a few percent only ) .",
    "so , we may use the non - relativistic @xmath9 wave function with @xmath89 , to obtain a result with good accuracy .",

    "unfortunately , the shuvaev transform is not valid in the time - like region @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the real part of the amplitude can be included via dispersive methods on the level of the amplitude .",
    "however , giving a prediction of the full cross section is not our objective here .",
    "rather our aim is to study the stability of the perturbative predictions and to investigate whether or not we can determine optimum scales so that experimental data for these processes , and the related @xmath21 processes , can be included in global pdf ( collinear ) analyses to constrain the gluon pdf at low @xmath3 , in a domain for which , at present , there are no data . for this goal",
    "it is sufficient to work with the more simple imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "we recall the main result of section 2 .",
    "we start from the key equation ,  ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) , that is @xmath148 to obtain this result we had introduced by hand a new scale @xmath30 in the lo term and showed that the choice @xmath149 allowed us to resum and transfer all the enhanced large @xmath4 terms from the nlo contribution to the lo term , leaving a much smaller remaining nlo contribution @xmath150 .",
    "there is still a @xmath105 scale dependence , but now this should be much weaker .      to obtain predictions for exclusive @xmath9 photoproduction",
    "we are working at scales close to the input gpds used in the calculation .",
    "the results for the scale variation of the imaginary part of the amplitude are shown in the two plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] . in each plot",
    "we show separately the lo and nlo contributions to the amplitude .",
    "the left plot shows how these contributions change if we vary all the scales @xmath151 simultaneously , taking @xmath152 . in the right plot",
    "we fix @xmath30 at the optimum scale @xmath84 and vary @xmath153 .",
    "the result is dramatic .",
    "the transfer of the @xmath4 terms from the nlo to the lo contribution has significantly reduced the @xmath105 scale dependence .",
    "but there is another , more severe problem .",
    "the lo contribution is dominated by the nlo contribution of opposite sign .",
    "thus the imaginary part of the quasi - elastic @xmath31 amplitude changes sign when the nlo contribution is added .",
    "as it stands , this result is in contradiction with modelling the interaction as an elastic forward scattering where the imaginary part of the amplitude is positive .",
    "what is happening ?",
    "the explanation is interesting . in general , the global dglap pdf analyses start from input forms which are completely arbitrary and , moreover , neglecting any constraints , know nothing about the structure of the evolution at low @xmath135 .",
    "it is then found that the gluon pdf tends to be small , or even negative , in the low @xmath135 , low @xmath3 @xmath154 domain , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lowxgluon ] . clearly due to the lack of data constraints in this domain the gluon is not reliably known .",
    "let us study the over - simplified case with an input gluon @xmath155 so that at the input scale we have only quark pdfs . for @xmath156",
    "the quark contribution only appears at nlo .",
    "the imaginary part of this nlo contribution is negative with respect to the normal @xmath157 lo term . indeed , when calculating the nlo coefficient function we must subtract the contribution which is already generated by lo evolution .",
    "however , the subtraction is performed purely formally in order to avoid the infrared divergence and _ does not _ account for the actual value of the gluon density used to calculate the lo term .",
    "therefore , at low scales , where the lo term is suppressed by much too small ` unphysical ' gluon pdfs obtained from the global fits , the nlo term generated by the quark is not just a correction , but is the dominant contribution . as a consequence ,",
    "the imaginary part of the quasi - elastic amplitude becomes negative ( in comparison with the lo contribution ) and the observed behaviour reveals a lack of stability of the perturbative series at this order .",
    "of course , at high scales where evolution , and not the input , determine the pdfs , we obtain a sensible nlo prediction .     as determined by two recent global analyses  @xcite .",
    "figure produced using  @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this simple consideration demonstrates that if @xmath158 and @xmath159 data could be included in a global fit , then they would put a strong constraint on the low @xmath3 input gluon distribution .",
    "it is not simply that @xmath160 must be positive , but that actually the input gluons can not be smaller than the density of gluons emitted by the quarks before the beginning of the evolution , when the parton virtuality @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath9 data would have been included in the collinear global parton analyses , this constraint on the low @xmath3 input gluon would have been automatically satisfied .",
    "indeed , it is seen from the second plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] that after the @xmath4 enhanced corrections are resummed by fixing @xmath84 , the stability of both the lo and the nlo components of the amplitude under the scale variations are much better . from this viewpoint",
    "the @xmath9 data may be included in a global pdf analysis .",
    "the only problem is that the gluon density obtained in the existing pdf analyses is too small at input scales and low @xmath3 ( @xmath162 ) , so that we get the wrong sign of the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "this means that if @xmath9 data were included in the global pdf analyses , we must get a larger gluon density at low scales . and low @xmath135 .",
    "the existing very small gluon densities in this kinematic domain are a way of mimicking these absorptive effects . ]",
    "larger gluons in this kinematic domain will increase the lo component of the @xmath9 photoproduction amplitude and will provide the correct sign for the whole lo+nlo amplitude .",
    "the top two plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : u1 ] show the results for the scale sensitivity of @xmath145 , analogous to those of fig .  [",
    "fig : j ] for @xmath164 .",
    "again we see that fixing the scale @xmath165 reduces the @xmath105 scale uncertainty .",
    "the lower two plots show that part of this stability arises because the change caused by variation of @xmath146 is to some extent compensated by an ` opposite ' change due to the variation of @xmath105 . if we were to choose a non - optimal scale ,",
    "say for example , @xmath166 , then the scale variation turns out to be about twice as large as for the optimal choice @xmath167 . due to the larger @xmath2 mass we are now working at scales with more perturbative stability .",
    "the lo contribution is partly cancelled by the nlo term , but is not dominated by it . if we take the upper right or lower left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : u1 ] then the @xmath105 scale uncertainty of the amplitude is about @xmath6 and @xmath168 respectively . as a result",
    "the data for exclusive @xmath2 production can be used in global pdf analyses to probe the gluon distribution down to @xmath23 , in the case of lhcb kinematics .",
    "the calculation of exclusive @xmath169 is described in  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the sum of the two diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : udiag ] . for an @xmath2 produced at large rapidity @xmath170 ,",
    "the dominant contribution is from the diagram with the larger @xmath58 centre - of - mass energy @xmath171 , which depends on the gluon density at @xmath172 .",
    "the small contribution from the other diagram , with much lower energy @xmath173 , may be estimated from the existing hera data .",
    "production at the lhc .",
    "diagram ( a ) , the @xmath171 component , is the dominant contribution for an @xmath2 produced at large rapidity @xmath170 .",
    "thus data for @xmath169 allow a probe of very low @xmath3 values , @xmath174 ; recall that in the ( dominant ) imaginary part of the born amplitude we have @xmath175.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   production at the lhc .",
    "diagram ( a ) , the @xmath171 component , is the dominant contribution for an @xmath2 produced at large rapidity @xmath170 .",
    "thus data for @xmath169 allow a probe of very low @xmath3 values , @xmath174 ; recall that in the ( dominant ) imaginary part of the born amplitude we have @xmath175.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    if we use the central values of the presently available pdf sets obtained from global analyses , then we find cross section predictions which are about a factor of four below the hera exclusive @xmath2 data  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that future pdf global analyses with @xmath2 data included will , just as for @xmath9 data , require a larger gluon distribution at low values of @xmath3 .",
    "while the exclusive @xmath2 process samples the pdfs at scales @xmath176 , the larger gluon required at these @xmath135 will affect the gluon densities at all values of @xmath135 via the evolution .",
    "the collinear dglap global analyses tend to result in gluon distributions with valence - like @xmath3 distributions at low scales , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lowxgluon ] . on the other hand , the approach used in the jmrt paper  @xcite , to study exclusive vector meson production , is free from this problem .",
    "there , the ` nlo ' prediction was not calculated as a correction from nlo feynman diagrams in collinear factorisation , but approximated by taking the full integral over the gluon @xmath133 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo](a ) , including an ansatz for the now @xmath133 dependent gluon .",
    "the convergence of this explicit @xmath133 integral provides effectively the ` optimal ' value of the factorisation scale and in this way sums all @xmath4 enhanced terms , accounting for a large part of the nlo corrections .",
    "it does , of course , not include corrections from diagrams which do not have a ladder structure , however , the contribution from the light quarks , fig .",
    "[ fig : lo](b ) , is already included in the unintegrated gluon distribution used in jmrt  @xcite . clearly , then the quasi - elastic amplitude is positive definite .",
    "let us briefly describe how our ` nlo ' predictions for @xmath145 data were made .",
    "first the incoming gluon distribution was fitted , within this approach and using an ansatz for the gluon based on the important double - logarithmic dependence on @xmath129 and @xmath177 , to reproduce the @xmath9 data from hera and the lhc .",
    "then we proceeded to @xmath2 production using our fitted gluon .",
    "we verified that , in the relevant kinematic domain , this gluon reproduces the nlo dglap evolution to good accuracy .",
    "therefore it was not surprising that the ` nlo ' _ predictions _ for the @xmath2 cross section , as a function of @xmath57 , agreed well with the lhcb data  @xcite when they became available .",
    "here we have been concerned about the inclusion of exclusive vector meson production data in global pdf analyses in order to probe the gluon density at small values of @xmath3 ; that is , in the @xmath178 domain .",
    "note that in this domain the input gluon pdf is freely parametrized , and is found to have a tendency to be valence - like with large uncertainties .",
    "it was hoped that the situation would be changed as data for exclusive vector meson production , @xmath1 and @xmath179 , which are very sensitive to the gluon at small @xmath3 , became available at hera and the lhc ; particularly measurements of the exclusive process @xmath21 at the lhc with @xmath24 detected at large rapidity .",
    "why has this not happened ( so far ) ?    for @xmath9 , the main problem is , at first sight , the very poor convergence of the perturbative expansion in the collinear approach .",
    "this can be seen , e.g. , from fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] , where the nlo contribution is comparable to the lo term and opposite in sign .",
    "however , we argued that this large nlo contribution , in comparison with that of the lo , reflects not the poor convergence , but rather that the global pdf analyses find a gluon density which is too small at low @xmath3 and low scales .",
    "for this reason we find a lo contribution to exclusive @xmath9 photoproduction amplitude which is too small .",
    "we argued that the input gluon in the collinear approach , used in the global pdf analyses , should not be parametrized freely , but should be subject to some constraints .",
    "we noted that working in the physical , @xmath133-factorisation type scheme would avoid these problems .    for exclusive @xmath2 production",
    "the situation is much better .",
    "we found that the optimum factorisation scale is much higher , the perturbative expansion at nlo in collinear factorisation converges well , and the remaining mild scale dependence of the predictions ( @xmath180 on amplitude level ) means that data for @xmath181 can now be included in the global pdf fits to determine the gluon in the low @xmath3 regime for the first time .",
    "it is appropriate to list the theoretical uncertainties of the present calculation .",
    "although the leading double log terms have been resummed correctly to all orders , there still exist remaining nnlo and higher contributions , which are unknown at present . when the full nnlo amplitude is known we showed how the scale uncertainty can be further reduced .",
    "next , we consider the accuracy of the expressions which relate gpds to conventional pdfs , ( [ eq : shuvq ] ) and ( [ eq : shuvg ] ) .",
    "these relations are based on conformal invariance and the equality of the gegenbauer moments of gpds to the mellin moments of pdfs . due to the polynominal property @xcite",
    "the accuracy of this equality of the moments is @xmath182 , providing an @xmath74 accuracy for ( [ eq : shuvq ] ) and ( [ eq : shuvg ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "however , recall that the shuvaev transform _ assumes _ the absence of the singularities in the right - half mellin-@xmath28 plane for the input distribution .",
    "this assumption is physically reasonable since in the regge approach there are no singularities in the right - half ( @xmath183 ) plane in the space - like ( @xmath184 ) domain where we actually work .",
    "nevertheless , whenever possible , this assumption should be checked .",
    "one check is that the predictions for the gpd / pdf ratio obtained in this way are in a good agreement ( especially for low @xmath3 gluons , which are the most important for exclusive @xmath9 or @xmath2 production ) with the nlo results of @xcite coming from a fit to deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) hera data .",
    "finally , the relativistic correction to the vector meson wave function , which is discussed in section [ sec : lo ] , is not expected to be significant @xcite .",
    "we noted that an alternative probe of the low @xmath3 gluon at low scales has been considered in @xcite .",
    "there they study the data for charm ( and beauty ) production obtained in the forward direction by the lhcb collaboration @xcite .",
    "again it is found that the predictions strongly depend on the choice of factorization scale .",
    "their prediction is lower than the data if the natural scale @xmath185 is chosen , and it is found that a larger @xmath30 is needed to reproduce the data using the existing global pdfs .",
    "thus our expectation of a larger gluon at low @xmath3 is not in contradiction with the lhcb charm ( and beauty ) forward data .",
