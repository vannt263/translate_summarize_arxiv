    "semidefinite programming consists in optimizing a linear function over a spectrahedron .",
    "the latter is a subset of @xmath0 defined by linear matrix inequalities , i.e. , a set of the form @xmath1 where the @xmath2 are symmetric matrices of order @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denotes the loewner order on the space of symmetric matrices . by definition , @xmath5 if and only if @xmath6 is positive semidefinite .",
    "semidefinite programming is a fundamental tool in convex optimization .",
    "it is used to solve various applications from engineering sciences , and also to obtain approximate solutions or bounds for hard problems arising in combinatorial optimization and semialgebraic optimization .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for information .",
    "semidefinite programs are usually solved via interior point methods .",
    "the latter provide an approximate solution in a polynomial number of iterations , provided that a strictly feasible initial solution , i.e. , a point belonging to the interior of the set @xmath7 , is known .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed analysis of the complexity in the bit model of interior point methods for semidefinite programming , and for a discussion of earlier complexity results based on the ellipsoid method .",
    "semidefinite programming becomes a much harder matter if one requires an exact solution .",
    "the feasibility problem ( deciding the emptiness of the set @xmath7 ) belongs to @xmath8 , where the subscript @xmath9 refers to the bss model of computation  @xcite .",
    "it is not known to be in @xmath10 in the bit model .",
    "a difficulty here is that all feasible points may have entries of absolute value doubly exponential in the size of the input .",
    "also , there may be no rational solution  @xcite . beyond their theoretical interest , exact algorithms for",
    "semidefinite programming may be useful to address problems of formal proofs , which sometimes lead to challenging ( degenerate ) instances  @xcite .",
    "known exact methods rely either on general purpose semialgebraic techniques ( like cylindrical decomposition ) or on dedicated methods based on the computation of critical points , see the recent work  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "semidefinite programing is meaningful in any real closed field , and in particular in _ nonarchimedean _ ( real closed ) fields like the field of puiseux series with real coefficients .",
    "such nonarchimedean semidefinite programming problems arise when considering _ parametric _ semidefinite programming problems over the reals , or structured problems in which the entries of the matrices have different orders of magnitudes .",
    "they are also of an intrinsic interest , since , by analogy with the situation in linear programming  @xcite , shifting to the nonarchimedean case is expected to shed light on the complexity of the classical problem over the reals .",
    "we note that the fields of formal puiseux series are representative of the general nonarchimedean situation , since any nonarchimedean ordered field can be embedded in a field of generalized ( hahn ) formal series  ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.2.20 ) .      in this paper",
    ", we address semidefinite programming in the _ nonarchimedean _ case , to which methods from tropical geometry can be applied .",
    "these methods are expected to allow one , in generic situations , to reduce semialgebraic problems to combinatorial problems , involving only the nonarchimedean valuations ( leading exponents ) of the coefficients of the input .",
    "we exploit the tropical approach by considering tropical spectrahedra , defined as the images by the valuation of nonarchimedean spectrahedra .",
    "we first give a combinatorial description ( theorem  [ theorem : tropical_metzler_spectrahedron ] and theorem  [ th - partsregular ] ) of tropical spectrahedra arising as the images of generic nonarchimedean spectrahedra determined by symmetric matrices that satisfy a metzler - type sign condition ( nonpositivity of off - diagonal entries ) .",
    "the subclass of inputs under consideration already covers known hard examples of semidefinite feasibility problems , involving for instance cascades of quadratic inequalities , as in  @xcite .",
    "the genericity assumption involves valuations .",
    "assumptions of this nature are familiar in tropical geometry .",
    "then , we show ( corollaries  [ corollary : spectra_and_game ] and  [ coro - simple ] ) that the tropical semidefinite feasibility problem for the aforementioned class is equivalent to solving stochastic mean payoff games . the latter are a well - studied class of combinatorial zero - sum games with perfect information . the complexity of these games is a long - standing open problem .",
    "they belong to the class @xmath11 , but they are not known to be polynomial .    this allows us to apply stochastic game algorithms to solve nonarchimedean semidefinite feasibility problems ( section  [ sec - algo ] ) .",
    "we obtain in this way both theoretical bounds and a practicable method which solves some large scale instances .",
    "we point out that this paper is an extended version of the proceedings article  @xcite .",
    "it is a general principle in tropical geometry that some information on the solutions of polynomial systems can be obtained by combinatorial reasoning about valuations .",
    "early incarnations of this idea are the patchworking method of viro to construct real curves with a prescribed topology  @xcite and its extension by sturmfels  @xcite to the case of complete intersections of hypersurfaces .",
    "see also the more recent work by bihan  @xcite .",
    "our characterization of tropical spectrahedra is obtained by applying the same kind of ideas to a class of _ semialgebraic _ systems which arise from semidefinite feasibility problems ( we deal with inequalities , instead of equalities ) .",
    "yu  @xcite showed that the image by the valuation of the cone of nonarchimedean positive semidefinite matrices is described only by tropical minors of order @xmath12 .",
    "our combinatorial characterization of tropical metzler spectrahedra can be thought of as an extension of her theorem to the case of nonarchimedean spectrahedra .",
    "this work also originates from the equivalence between tropical polyhedral feasibility problems and deterministic zero - sum games with mean payoff , established by akian , gaubert , and guterman  @xcite .",
    "the novelty here is the handling of nonlinear semialgebraic convex problems , and the proof that the well - known class of _ stochastic _ mean payoff games correspond precisely to semidefinite feasibility problems with a metzler structure , therefore relating two classes of problems which both have an unsettled complexity .    finally , as mentioned above , the computation of exact solutions of semidefinite programming problems is of current interest . in particular , nie , ranestad , and sturmfels",

    "it is known that @xmath13 is a real closed field ( see  @xcite for instance ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a homogeneous variant of the semidefinite feasibility problem over the field @xmath13 .",
    "more precisely , given symmetric matrices @xmath31 , the problem which we study consists in determining whether or not the following spectrahedral cone @xmath32 is _ trivial _ , meaning that it is reduced to the identically null point of @xmath33 .",
    "the linear map @xmath34 is a _ matrix pencil _ , which we denote by @xmath35 for more brevity .",
    "the latter decision problem is in fact equivalent to the nontriviality problem of general spectrahedral cones in which the nonnegativity condition @xmath36 is relaxed .",
    "indeed , given a pencil @xmath35 of symmetric matrices , the spectrahedron @xmath37 is trivial if and only if the spectrahedron @xmath38 is trivial .",
    "even if the instances arising in this way are unlikely to be generic in the sense we define later in section  [ section : spectrahedra ] , we consider that the decision problem which we focus on already retains much of the complexity of the semidefinite feasibility problem over the field of puiseux series .",

    "currently , we are unable to give a full characterization of tropical spectrahedra .",
    "finally , an interesting question is to use the present approach to deal with the real case , i.e. , to see @xmath15 as a deformation parameter and use the fact that the semidefinite feasibility problem is easily solvable for a large parameter @xmath15 , to infer the solvability for smaller values of @xmath15 .",
