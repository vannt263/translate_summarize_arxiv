    "the main contribution of this paper is thus the construction of the appropriate measurable cross sections .",
    "even this is simply an adaption of the construction given in @xcite ; however , in that setting , the fact that the map on the cross section was a _ first _ return was evident . that this is true in our more general setting requires equation  ; and ,",

    "+ the study of the intertwined nature of continued fractions and the geodesic flow on the modular surface has a rich history .",
    "one of the first significant steps was e.  artin s  @xcite coding of geodesics in terms of the regular continued fraction expansions of the real endpoints of their lifts .",
    "hedlund @xcite then used this to show the ergodicity of the geodesic flow on the modular surface .",
    "a few years later , e.  hopf proved ergodicity for the geodesic flow on any hyperbolic surface of finite volume , see his reprisal @xcite . taking up on an approach revived by moeckel @xcite , series  @xcite gave an explicit cross section for the geodesic flow on the modular surface such that the regular continued fraction map is given as a factor .",
    "adler and flatto gave a second approach , see especially their @xcite .",
    "quite recently , d.  mayer and co - authors  @xcite ,  @xcite have given explicit cross sections for the geodesic flow on the surfaces uniformized by the hecke triangle groups such that a variant , due to nakada  @xcite , of the rosen continued fractions @xcite is given as a factor .",
    "( the second - named author first learned of such possibilities from a.  haas , see the related treatment of another variant of the rosen fractions in @xcite . ) for much of this history , further motivation , and also the work of s.  katok and co - authors using various means to code geodesics on the modular surface , see @xcite .",
    "as stated above , our work here is directly inspired by another approach to identifying cross sections related to continued fractions , that of arnoux @xcite . that work can be viewed as an elaboration of veech s @xcite notion of `` zippered rectangles '' in the special case of surfaces of genus one .",
    "here we proceed by , in a sense , extracting the algebraic expression for the cross section determined in @xcite , and adjusting this appropriately so as to pass from the planar models of the natural extensions given by @xcite to our cross sections .",
    "thus , whereas the various cross sections mentioned in the previous paragraph were each constructed in what can be called a geometric fashion , we use a more algebraic approach .",
    "+ there has been a great deal of recent interest in the @xmath0-continued fractions maps , and especially in the function associating to @xmath0 the entropy of the corresponding map .",
    "nakada @xcite computed the entropy of his maps for @xmath32 .",
    "kraaikamp @xcite gave a more direct fashion to compute these .",
    "moussa , cassa and marmi @xcite gave the entropy for the maps with @xmath33 .",
    "luzzi and marmi @xcite presented numeric data showing that the entropy function @xmath34 behaves in a rather complicated fashion as @xmath0 varies .",
    "nakada and natsui  @xcite gave explicit intervals on which @xmath34 is respectively constant , increasing , decreasing .",
    "carminati and tiozzo  @xcite extended this work by describing the intervals involved .",
    "the same authors have revisited the question of the shape of the entropy function in terms of @xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "luzzi and marmi @xcite also gave strong evidence that the entropy function is continuous .",
    "( they furthermore gave numeric evidence that the function is far from trivial , see the graphs they present in their figures  48 ) .",
    "tiozzo @xcite showed continuity for @xmath0 above a certain positive constant , kraaikamp - schmidt - steiner @xcite show the continuity for positive @xmath0 .",
    "( after that work was completed , tiozzo in an updated version of @xcite showed that hlder continuity holds throughout the full interval . )    the proof of the continuity of @xmath34 given in @xcite proceeds by first showing equation   so as then to turn to the key result , the continuity of the function @xmath35 ( that the geometry , and even topology , of the @xmath9 change drastically is evidenced in figure  6 of @xcite . ) the proof of equation   consists mainly in showing that for any @xmath36 , the intersection @xmath37 is nontrivial , and the return maps of each of @xmath8 and @xmath38 to this intersection agree ; from this one uses abramov s formula and the fact that the equation certainly holds for @xmath26 .",
    "( the proof of continuity of @xmath35 is much harder , in briefest terms : the shape of @xmath9 is determined mainly by the @xmath2-orbits of @xmath0 and @xmath39 , there are intervals of @xmath0 such that these two orbits meet , and in a common fashion ; continuity is fairly straightforward for each of these intervals ; the remaining set of @xmath0 is such that the key orbits can still be described symbolically , the difference in measure for nearby @xmath40 is bounded above using this description . )",
    "luzzi and marmi @xcite seem to be the first to ask in print if the @xmath0-continued fractions arise as a factor of the geodesic flow on the modular surface .",
    "folklore consensus seems to be that determining whether the @xmath0-continued fractions are or not factors of a cross section for the geodesic flow remained an important unsolved problem .",
    "+ to show the robustness of our basic argument , in section  [ s : rosencf ] we sketch a proof that the rosen continued fraction maps and certain of their @xmath0-type variants are also factors of cross sections of geodesic flow over the corresponding hyperbolic surface .",
    "rosen @xcite introduced his analogs of the nearest integer continued fractions to assist in the study of the hecke triangle fuchsian groups , see below for definitions .",
    "there has been increasing interest in the past few decades in these continued fractions , see @xcite for a sketch of the history to the mid-1990s , and the aforementioned @xcite , @xcite for some of the more recent history ; the @xmath0-rosen continued fractions , that we treat as well , were introduced by dajani , kraaikamp and steiner @xcite in 2009 .",
    "+ in light of the extremely complicated geometry and topology of the various cross sections that we determine , it would be interesting to know if the more geometric approaches to the construction of cross sections giving interval maps as factors could be successful in our setting .    * thanks * the second - named author takes great pleasure in thanking cor kraaikamp and wolfgang steiner for introducing him to the intricacies of the @xmath0-continued fractions and for comments on this continuation of joint work .",
