    "astrophysical relativistic jets are associated with several kinds of astrophysical systems which include x - ray binaries hosting stellar mass black holes ( also denominated microquasars ) , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . according to their observed speed , one can separate them into : mildly relativistic ( @xmath0 ) as in the case of microquasars like ss 433 and cyg x-3 or low - luminous agns , highly relativistic ( @xmath1 ) as in microquasars like grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 , extremely relativistic ( @xmath2 ) as in some high - luminous agns ( blazars ) , and ultra - relativistic jets ( @xmath3 ) as in the grbs ( e.g. , kato et al . 2008 )",
    ". observations of polarized non - thermal radiation ( from radio to gamma - rays ) indicate that these sources and their jets may be strongly magnetized particularly near the nuclear region .",
    "for instance , gamma - ray observations indicate a strongly polarized component related to the jet detected in the hard state of the microquasar cyg x-1 ( e.g. , laurent et al . 2011 ) . assuming equipartition between the magnetic energy and the kinetic power of the observed relativistic jets in x - ray binaries and magnetic flux conservation , typical estimates of the magnetic fields in the innermost stable circular orbit of the stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) are in the range @xmath4 g ( piotrovich et al .",
    "2014 ; see also de gouveia dal pino & lazarian 2005 ; kadowaki et al .",
    "2015 ; and singh et al .",
    "2015 for similar estimated values using magnetohydrodynamical balancing in the inner accretion disk / bh region ) . in case of agns , physical parameters of the jets can be determined for instance from the analysis of the frequency dependence of the observed shift of the core of relativistic jets using very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) radio data ( e.g. , from mojave data base ) .",
    "recent studies in this direction are consistent with the extraction rotational energy from the bh in presence of a large scale magnetic field ( e.g. , nokhrina et al .",
    "also , observations generally favour a cylindrical shape for the internal structure of the outflow . in another work by marti - vidal et al .",
    "( 2015 ) regarding the agn pks 1830 - 211 , the the detected polarization signal seems to be related to a strong magnetic field at the jet base . in the case of grbs ,",
    "if one relies only on the ambient magnetic field that is swept ( and amplified ) by the passage of the shock front of the jet head , one can not explain the observed afterglow emission in these sources ( rocha da silva et al .",
    "nevertheless , the polarization studies associated with afterglow emission indicate the presence and survival of internally magnetized baryonic jets with large - scale uniform magnetic fields ( mundell et al .",
    "2013 ; wiersema et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "several mechanisms of jet flow acceleration and collimation , namely , gas - dynamics acceleration , acceleration by radiation and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) mechanisms ( begelman et al . 1984 and references therein ) have been proposed and it is also possible that different mechanisms operate in different sources ( de gouveia dal pino 2005 ) , or , otherwise , all mechanisms are operating simultaneously ( beskin 2010 ) . currently there is  democratic \" consensus that the jets may arise from the combined effect of magnetic fields and rotation .",
    "the influential works are the blandford - znajek ( bz ) ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) . and the blandford - payne ( bp ) model ( blandford & payne 1982 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2001 and references therein ) . the relativistic poynting flux dominated ( energy and angular momentum outflow carried predominantly by the electromagnetic field ) steady jets from the agns , microquasars and grbs are believed to be driven by rotational energy of the black holes as invoked in the bz model . whereas the quasi - relativistic matter dominated steady jets",
    "are driven by rotational energy of accretion flow due to magneto - centrifugal mechanism as in the bp model .",
    "however there can be other alternative mechanisms such as gradient of magnetic and gas pressure .",
    "if the jet has sufficiently large specific enthalpy and is overpressured , the relativistic jets can be powerfully boosted by the propagation of rarefaction wave from the interface between jet and ambient medium ( e.g. , aloy & rezzolla 2006 ; mizuno et al .",
    "this acceleration mechanism has been produced multiple recollimation shock / rarefaction structure in the relativistic jets which related stationary features in observed relativistic jets ( e.g. , mizuno et al .",
    "2015 )    general relativistic mhd ( grmhd ) simulations with accretion disks around spinning black holes have shown the presence of high lorentz factor poynting dominated spine , mildly relativistic matter dominated sheath and sub - relativistic wind as components of outflows and jets ( abramowicz & fragile 2013 ; yuan & narayan 2014 and references therein ) .",
    "the spine - sheath structure of the jets have been observed in some nearby fri radio galaxies , like m87 ( kovalev et al . 2007 ) and 3c84 ( nagai et al .",
    "2014 ) , frii radiogalaxy like cyg a ( boccardi et al . 2015 ) and blazars like mrk501 ( giroletti et al . 2004 ) and 3c273 ( lobanov & zensus 2001 ) using high - resolution vlbi technique .",
    "it is believed that the relativistic jet should be kinetically dominated at the large scales though it can be poynting flux dominated at its base ( sikora et al .",
    "2005 ; giannios & spruit 2006 ) . on one hand , it has been suggested that the conversion of magnetic energy to kinetic energy can involve gradual acceleration due to adiabatic expansion of the outflow and the observed emission can be caused by dissipation of field ( if the magnetic field has the right geometry and scale ) as result of magnetic reconnection due to current - driven kink instability and /or other instabilities such as the kruskal - schwarzschild instability in a striped wind ( granot et al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) .",
    "other models suggest that the acceleration efficiency can be increased by relaxing the assumption of axisymmetry leading to non - axisymmetric instabilities that can randomize the magnetic field orientation leading to efficient acceleration similar to thermal acceleration of relativistic outflows .",
    "recent advances in numerical solutions for relativistic mhd have led to significant progress to understand more about the magnetic jet launching , propagation and acceleration ( kumar & zhang 2015 and references therein ) , however the stabilities properties of jets are still under debate .",
    "important signatures of the jet morphology are given by the non - thermal radiation that they emit from radio to gamma - rays .",
    "this is produced by relativistic particles accelerated along the flow . in regions where shock discontinuities are evidenced like in the bright internal knots or at the terminal bow shock at the jet head",
    ", the particle acceleration is attributed to diffusive fermi shock acceleration . however , in magnetically dominated regions specially near the nuclear region , shocks are faint and particle acceleration is attributed to fermi process in magnetic reconnection discontinuities ( de gouveia dal pino & lazarian 2005 ; kowal et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ; giannios 2010 ; sironi & spitkovsky 2014 ; de gouveia dal pino & kowal 2015 ) .    when jets are magnetically dominated , they are likely to experience current driven instability ( cdi ) which in turn may drive reconnection , while in case of kinetically dominated jets , kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) driven by velocity shear between the jet and the surrounding medium comes into play . using vlbi ,",
    "twisted structures are observed in several agn jets on sub - parsec , parsec and kilo - parsec scales ( gomez et al .",
    "2001 ; lovanov & zensus 2001 ; lovanov , hardee & eilek 2003 ) .",
    "these structures can be formed due to the jet precession and/or mhd instabilities like cdi or khi .",
    "jet structures attributed to instabilities are even seen in laboratory experiments ( hsu & bellan 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetic jet simulations have confirmed that the helical twisted structures in the jets are due to cdi or khi ( hardee 2013 ; mizuno et al .",
    "2014 and references therein ) .",
    "twisted structures and the sense of twist can be triggered by the precession of the jet base ( begelman et al .",
    "1980 ) or by rotation of the jet fluid or by magnetic field helicity . in mhd models for jet collimation and acceleration , a toroidal magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) is wound up due to rotating disk and/or spinning black hole or neutron star and eventually dominates over the poloidal magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) because @xmath6 falls off faster with expansion and distance .",
    "the strong toroidal magnetic field is cd kink mode unstable ( begelman 1998 ) . according to kruskal - shafranov ( ks ) instability criterion , cylindrical mhd configurations in which @xmath5 dominates are violently unstable to the m=1 kink mode ( screw instability ) .",
    "the ks criterion for instability indicates that the instability develops if the length of a static plasma column is long enough for the field lines to go around the column at least once i.e. @xmath7 ( e.g. bateman 1978 ) where @xmath8 is the cylindrical radius and z the length of the jet .",
    "astrophysical jets can be sometimes violently unstable and eventually the power of the bz mechanism may be significantly suppressed ( li 2000 ) .",
    "non - relativistic analytical works ( appl et al . 2000 ; baty 2005 ) and numerical simulations ( lery et al.2000 ; baty & keppens 2002 ) show that cdi growth rates exceed khi growth rates for sufficiently large magnetic field strength and helicity .",
    "cdi mode becomes dominant at increased helicity as the instability results from an imbalance between destabilizing toroidal and stabilizing poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "one approach to study simplistic picture of relativistic jet is to consider force - free approximation in which only the charges , currents and fields are considered while the inertia and pressure of the plasma are ignored .",
    "this is valid whenever poynting flux dominated jets are taken into account .",
    "cylindrical force - free jets are kink stable if the axial magnetic field , @xmath9 , is independent of r ( istomin & pariev 1994 , 1996 ) but are kink unstable if @xmath9 decreases with increasing distance from the axis ( begelman 1998 ; lyubarsky 1999 ) .",
    "the classical ks criterion can be extended if the stabilizing effect of the relativistic field line rotation is taken into account which ensures the importance of the bz mechanism at large distances from black hole ( tomimatsu et al .",
    "the jets are unstable only if both the ks criterion and the condition : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the angular velocity of the field lines and @xmath12 the speed of light , are satisfied .",
    "all of the above mentioned analyses have been done in static reference frame with the jet of infinite extent .",
    "further , assuming a rigid wall enclosing the jet , a class of force - free cylindrical jet equilibria including the important effects of the poloidal field curvature was studied and the kink mode growth was found to be much slower than that expected from the ks instability criterion ( narayan et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the temporal development of the cd kink instability in relativistic cylindrical jets using periodic computational box has been explored by several groups . using the 3d general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical ( grmhd ) code ` raishin ` , mizuno et al .",
    "( 2009 ) studied the instability of a helically magnetized relativistic non - rotating force - free static plasma column and showed that the initial configuration is strongly distorted but not disrupted by the kink instability .",
    "the growth rate and nonlinear evolution of the cd kink instability depends moderately on the density profile and strongly on the magnetic pitch profile .",
    "this work was further extended by mizuno et al .",
    "( 2011 ) where the influence of a velocity shear surface on the development of the cd kink instability in a sub - alfvnic non - rotating jet was investigated .",
    "it was found that the helically distorted density structure propagated along the jet with speed and flow structure dependent on the ratio between the radius of the velocity shear surface and the characteristic radius of the helically twisted force - free magnetic field . adopting a similar approach as that of mizuno et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , oneill et al .",
    "( 2012 ) studied local models of comoving magnetized plasma columns in force - free , pressure- and rotation - supported equilibrium configurations using the 3d relativistic mhd code ` athena ` ( beckwith & stone 2011 ) .",
    "they found the development of dissimilar structures in different configurations , however all those configurations of plasma columns were nominally unstable to cdi . in another interesting work of uniform density , small magnetic pitch and highly magnetized plasma column , anjiri et al .",
    "( 2014 ) studied and quantified the growth of cdi and khi considering three different cases corresponding to static , trans - alfvnic and super - alfvnic non - rotating jets using the mhd module of the ` pluto ` code ( mignone et al .",
    "2007 ) . in mizuno",
    "et al . ( 2012 ) , the influence of jet rotation and differential motion on the cd kink instability was studied for rotating helically magnetized relativistic jet with decreasing density profile and it was found that in accordance with the linear stability theory , the development of the instability depends on the lateral distribution of the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "if the poloidal field significantly decreases outward from the axis , then the initial small perturbations grow strongly , and if multiple wavelengths are excited , then nonlinear interaction eventually disrupts the initial cylindrical configuration . when the profile of the poloidal field is shallow , the instability develops slowly and eventually saturates .",
    "recently porth & komissarov ( 2015 ) studied the causality and stability of non - rotating cylindrical static columns with purely toroidal magnetic field and took into account the role of the jet expansion in atmospheres with power - law pressure distribution .",
    "the initial configuration was perturbed in the same way as that of mizuno et al .",
    "( 2012 ) via the adding of the radial velocity component to the jet velocity field .",
    "the simulations have been carried out using the ` mpi - amrvac ` code ( porth et al .",
    "2014 ; keppens et al . 2012 ) and the test configuration was found to be disruptively unstable to cd kink instability as compared to the force - free case .    in order to take into account proper real conditions , some non - relativistic ( e.g. , nakamura & meier 2004 ; nakamura et al . 2007 ; moll et al .",
    "2008 ; moll 2009 ) and relativistic ( e.g. , mckinney & blandford 2009 ; mignone et al . 2010 , 2013 ; porth 2013 ) mhd simulations of jet formation and propagation following the spatial properties of the development of the kink instability in the jet have been performed . using the 3d grmhd ` harm ` code ( gammie , mckinney & toth 2003 ) , mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) simulated rapidly rotating , accreting black holes producing jets containing both toroidal and poloidal field components and it was found that despite strong non - axisymmetric disc turbulence , the jet propagated and accelerated without significant disruption or dissipation with only mild substructure dominated by the kink mode . while mignone et al .",
    "( 2010 ) presented 3d simulations of relativistic magnetized jets carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field using the ` pluto ` code ( mignone et al .",
    "2007 ) and found that the toroidal field gives rise to strong cd kink instability leading to jet wiggling .",
    "nevertheless , it appears to be maintained a highly relativistic spine along its full length .",
    "furthermore , in another work by mignone et al .",
    "( 2013 ) it was concluded that jets with moderate to high magnetization parameter and relatively small bulk lorentz factor are most likely candidates for the dynamical behavior observed in the crab nebula jet .",
    "porth ( 2013 ) studied the formation of relativistic jets from rotating magnetospheres and the results showed a saturation of different mode perturbations including the kink mode before a notable dissipation or even disruption was encountered .",
    "recently , mizuno et al . (",
    "2014 ) studied the influence of the velocity shear and a radial density profile on the spatial development of the cd kink instability along helically magnetized non - rotating relativistic cylindrical jets using a non - periodic computational box and a precessional perturbation at the inlet triggering the growth of the kink instability .",
    "if the velocity shear radius is located inside the characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field , a static non - propagating cd kink is excited as the perturbation propagates downstream the jet . on the other hand ,",
    "if the velocity shear radius is outside the characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field , the kink is advected with the flow and grows spatially down the jet .",
    "when the density increases with radius , the kink appears to saturate by the end of the simulation without apparent disruption of the helical twist which suggests the relatively stable configuration for relativistic jets with tenuous spine and denser sheath .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the influence of the jet rotation as well as density profile on the spatial development of the cd kink instability in a rotating relativistic jet .",
    "based on temporal studies , it is well known how the cd kink instability depends on the differential motion , magnetic pitch profile and density profile ( mizuno et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 , 2012 ) . for this study we will consider constant magnetic pitch and take the radius of the jet core to be the same as that of the characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field . basically , we will attempt to extend further the work of mizuno et al .",
    "( 2014 ) by taking into account different angular velocity amplitudes of the jet and also compare with the temporal studies of rotating relativistic jets ( mizuno et al .",
    "2012 ) by considering decreasing and increasing density profiles .",
    "we will also examine the potential development of magnetic reconnection sites along the jet triggered by the cd modes and its implications for magnetic energy dissipation which may be particularly important both in the determination of the transition of poynting flux dominated to kinetically dominated regimes and for particle acceleration as stressed above , particularly in agn and grb jets ( e.g. , zhang & yan 2011 ; granot et al .",
    "2015 ; de gouveia dal pino & kowal 2015 ) .",
    "in fact , it is possible that the presence of turbulence in mhd flows can lead to fast magnetic reconnection ( lazarian & vishniac 1999 ) .",
    "zhang and yan ( 2011 ) , for instance , based on lazarian and vishniac ( 1999 ) and de gouveia dal pino & lazarian ( 2005 ) , proposed a model of grb prompt emission where turbulence , magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration can be induced by internal collisions . in this work ,",

    "the ubiquitous microscopic ohmic resistivity is enough to allow for magnetic reconnection , though in this case the rate at which the lines reconnect is very slow according to the sweet - parker mechanism ( e.g. , parker 1979 ) . in the present analysis , we are dealing with relativistic ideal mhd simulations with no explicit resistivity .",
    "this in principle would prevent us from detecting magnetic reconnection .",
    "nevertheless , in the numerical mhd simulations , magnetic reconnection can be excited because of the presence of numerical resistivity .",
    "this in turn , could make one to suspect that the identification of potential sites of magnetic reconnection in ideal mhd simulations would be essentially a numerical artifact . however , fortunately , based on the lazarian - vishniac model ( see lazarian & vishniac 1999 ; kowal et al . 2009 ; eyink et al . 2011 ; santos - lima et al . 2010 ; 2012 )",
    ", the presence of turbulence in real mhd flows is expected to speed up the reconnection to rates nearly as large as the local alfvn speed .",
    "this is because of the turbulent wandering of the magnetic field lines that allow them to touch each other in several patches simultaneously making reconnection very fast . even in sub - alfvnic flows as in the present case , where the magnetic fields are very strong this _ fast",
    "_ reconnection process may be very efficient .",
    "we see here that the kink instability itself is able to trigger turbulence in the flow as well as the close encounter of magnetic field lines with opposite polarity at least in one of the directions , in several regions which are identified by the large increase of the current density in very narrow regions ( which are potential sites of magnetic discontinuities or current sheets ) .",
    "the numerical resistivity simply mimics the effects of the ohmic resistivity , but the real and important physical effect that may allow for the fast reconnection is the process described above due to the turbulence .",
    "this process has been extensively and successfully tested numerically in several studies involving ideal mhd simulations of turbulent flows ( see e.g. , the references above and the reviews of lazarian et al . 2012 ; lazarian et al .",
    "2015 ) .                in summary , based on the facts above we may expect a direct correlation between the regions where there is maximum growth of the kink instability and regions of enhanced current densities where magnetic reconnection is possibly occurring . from figure [ f10_curlb_dec ]",
    "we clearly see that this is the case , i.e. , the location of maximum kink amplitude matches the maximum values of @xmath143 around @xmath144 . hence , this region is also the possible site for maximum energy dissipation through magnetic reconnection which can contribute to the increase in kinetic energy of the jet flow and also allow for efficient particle acceleration ( de gouveia dal pino & lazarian 2005 ; kowal et al .",

    "these turbulent regions contrast with the smoother non - perturbed region below @xmath141 where the jet is dominated by the helical force - free magnetic field configuration . in this region",
    ", we see that the current density component ( @xmath148 ) is very organized , as expected for a force - free configuration where @xmath149 is simply due to the variation of the regular azimuthal component of the magnetic field @xmath150 . in the x - y diagram of current density",
    ", we also identify the filamentary structure that partially destroys the smooth spiral pattern in this direction .",
    "finally , comparing the current density with the magnetization parameter @xmath151 diagrams , we see that regions with large intensity values of current density coincide with regions where the magnetization parameter @xmath151 is small , therefore strengthening the conclusion that these regions are sites of magnetic energy dissipation .",
    "similarly , figure [ f11_curlb_inc ] shows the same trend for the increasing density model with @xmath140 ( i2 ) at the terminal simulation time @xmath67 .",
    "the kink instability grows above @xmath152 which corresponds to the location of the maximum values of @xmath143 , as seen in the lower panel . in figure",
    "[ f13_2dcurlb_inc ] , in the 2d current density diagrams corresponding to this model we can also identify the high intensity filaments associated to regions of maximum kink instability and steep variations in the magnetic field direction , characterizing sites of magnetic reconnection , which are also correlated with regions of small magnetization parameter @xmath151 ( depicted in the same figure ) .",
    "these results are also indicative that the regions of kink instability are the sites of reconnection , magnetic energy dissipation and jet acceleration .",
    "to further stress the conclusions above , figure [ f14_2dturb ] shows 2d slices of the logarithmic distribution of the kinetic ( left panels ) and magnetic ( right panels ) energies in the xy plane at the same positions depicted in figures [ f12_2dcurlb_dec ] and [ f13_2dcurlb_inc ] for the heavy ( d2 ) and light ( i2 ) jets , respectively . in both cases",
    "we see that the regions near the center that have been identified as reconnection sites have larger kinetic energy than the surroundings , while the magnetic energy is smaller in these regions , indicating the conversion of the magnetic into kinetic energy .",
    "fast magnetic reconnection induced by turbulence has been previously tested numerically by kowal et al .",
    "( 2009 ) considering large scales 3d current sheets with injected steady state , incompressible turbulence .",
    "these authors measured the reconnection rate directly from their simulations considering the effective electric field in the plasma ( @xmath153 ; see their eq .",
    "recently takamoto et al . (",
    "2015 ) extended this numerical work to the relativistic regime considering both incompressible and compressible flows and found that the reconnection rate is independent of the plasma resistivity as in the non - relativistic case .",
    "they measured reconnection rate values between @xmath154 depending on the magnetization parameter @xmath151 of the flow . for incompressible plasmas with @xmath155 and @xmath156 , as in the present work , they found values @xmath157 and @xmath158 respectively .",
    "following kowal et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we also used their eq .",
    "( 13 ) to make a quite rough estimate of the reconnection rate in the magnetic reconnection sites identified in the heavy and light jets in figures [ f12_2dcurlb_dec ] to [ f13_2dcurlb_inc ] above .",
    "considering the values of the components of @xmath139 and @xmath159 in these regions , we obtained reconnection rates @xmath160 for both jets , which are comparable to the values obtained by takamoto et al .",
    "this further indicates that the turbulence due to the cd kink instability in the relativistic jets is able to induce fast magnetic reconnection .",
    "in this work we studied the influence of jet rotation on the spatial development of the cd kink instability using a non - periodic computational box . in our spatial - growth simulations and also in previous temporal - growth simulations of the cd kink ( e.g. , mizuno et al . 2012 ) , the setup is built for the analysis of the structure of poynting - flux dominated jets ( lyubarsky 2009 ) . in the comoving frame ,",
    "the poloidal and toroidal fields are comparable for cylindrical equilibrium configurations . when the alfvn crossing time is smaller than the proper propagation time ( if the jet is narrow enough ) , the jet relaxes to a local equilibrium configuration .",
    "such jets can be subject to the kink instability because the characteristic instability timescale is larger than the alfvn crossing time .",
    "it is to be noted that in relativistic jet flows , when the toroidal field exceeds the poloidal one , the hoop stress is counter - balanced by the electric force and the poloidal magnetic field pressure gradient where the centrifugal force and the gas pressure remains small .",
    "this is the reason why well beyond the alfvn point , the flow can still remain poynting - flux dominated and the flow structure is close to a cylindrical configuration .",
    "the previous study of temporal growth of the cd kink instability used a periodic computational box and uniform spatial perturbation of the jet across the computational box domain . for a radially decreasing density profile , mizuno et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that for an angular velocity @xmath54 and magnetic helicity @xmath53 , the displacement of the initial force - free helical magnetic field resulting from the growth of the cd kink instability leads to a helically twisted magnetic filament around density isosurfaces near the axis associated with the @xmath161 kink mode wavelength . in the nonlinear phase ,",
    "the helically distorted density structure showed continuous transverse growth and propagated along the flow direction . in the case of @xmath140 and @xmath52 models , development of both the @xmath161 and @xmath51 kink mode wavelengths were observed .",
    "here in all models corresponding to @xmath54 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , different kink wavelengths are seen at different positions along the transverse x - direction .",
    "it is seen that the magnetic pitch strongly decreases in the innermost region of the jet as the angular velocity amplitude increases .",
    "moreover , it is detected the growth of different axial kink wavelengths since this depends on the magnetic pitch .",
    "eventually the kink wavelength with maximum growth becomes dominant at each radial position .",
    "however the magnetic pitch remains essentially the same outside the jet core in all cases because of the initial constant magnetic pitch in a force - free magnetic field .",
    "thus similar long kink wavelengths are seen outside of the jet core . besides",
    ", short kink wavelengths usually do not evolve . on the other hand , at a particular radial location , mostly long axial kink wavelengths can grow which have lower growth rates than shorter kink wavelengths inside the jet core . as a result the longer kink wavelengths outside the jet core interact with the shorter kink wavelengths inside the jet core at later simulation times and further downstream the axial region when the shorter kink wavelengths have already entered the non - linear phase and this would accelerate the jet disruption .",
    "the evolution of the volume - averaged kinetic energy transverse to the z - axis shows an exponential growth , in agreement with the general theoretical estimate of the maximum instability growth rate .",
    "the evolution of the total volume - averaged relativistic electromagnetic energy is opposite to the evolution of kinetic energy , similar to results obtained in mizuno et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .    in the present work",
    ", the cd kink instability seems to be stabilized in the case of a radially increasing density profile compared to the decreasing density counterpart .",
    "the same effect was also reported in mizuno et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , but considering a spatial - growth study of non - rotating jets . an inner high - speed , low - density jet spine surrounded by a denser and slower sheath , as suggested by observations ( e.g. , boccardi et al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) and grmhd simulations of relativistic jet formation ( e.g. , mckinney 2006 ) is compatible with the scenario above of the increasing density models .",
    "thus we may expect the development of a cd kink in the jet , but it may saturate as a result of a radially increasing density structure as shown , e.g. , in mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) and this may also explain the non - destructive kink structures often observed in relativistic jets .",
    "our results also suggest that the poynting - flux dominated jets are accelerated up to approximate equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic energies and then the regular flow may be disrupted by the kink instability .",
    "such a scenario is valid for jets satisfying the causality condition which applies very well to the case of agn jets ( e.g. , pushkarev et al .",
    "though the causality condition seems to be violated in grb jets , the causally connected regions inside grb jets can undergo local internal kink instability as shown in recent work by bromberg & tchekhovskoy ( 2015 ) where the instability can cause small - angle magnetic reconnection ( see also tchekhovskoy & bromberg 2015 ) .",
    "shocks and magnetic reconnection have been considered as possible candidates for powering the jet emissions in agns and grbs .",
    "recent fully - kinetic particle - in - cell simulations have shown that shock models are unlikely to account for the jet emission ( sironi et al .",
    "shocks are not able to accelerate particle far beyond the thermal energy , however , magnetic reconnection can deposit more than 50 per cent of the dissipated energy into non - thermal leptons as long as the energy density of the magnetic field in the bulk flow is larger than the rest mass - energy density .",
    "several grb prompt emission models have been proposed based on the role of magnetic reconnection in the grb jets , like the magnetic heating photosphere model ( giannios 2008 ) , the internal collision - induced magnetic reconnection turbulent model ( icmart ; zhang & yan 2011 ) based on the lazarian - vishniac model of fast reconnection triggered by turbulence and the particle acceleration fermi mechanism by reconnection ( de gouveia dal pino & lazarian 2005 ) ; and the magnetic reconnection switch model ( mckinney & uzdensky 2012 ) .    in the study presented here",
    ", we imposed a precessional perturbation at the inlet of a rotating cylindrical jet that leads the displacement of the helical magnetic field configuration and induces the cd kink instability which in turn leads to magnetic reconnection and energy dissipation , as suggested by the results of figures [ f8_eevol_dec ] to [ f13_2dcurlb_inc ] .",
    "this goes to the kinetic energy of the flow and may also accelerate particles through a first - order fermi process in the magnetic reconnection regions ( e.g. de gouveia dal pino & lazarian 2005 ; kowal et al . 2011 ; 2012 ) .",
    "a recent study injecting test particles in an mhd relativistic jet has evidenced that the acceleration by magnetic reconnection may be dominating in the more turbulent magnetically dominated regions of the flow , like the cocoon that envelopes the jet , and is a competing process with the acceleration at the internal shocks along the beam and at the jet head ( de gouveia dal pino & kowal 2015 ) .",
    "further studies considering test particles in relativistic mhd jet simulations are required in order to understand better the energy dissipation , the relevant acceleration mechanisms and the non - thermal emission processes in such systems .",
    "the inclusion of the particle feedback on the plasma and vice - versa may be also implemented in such studies considering an mhd - pic approach ( e.g. , bai et al .",
