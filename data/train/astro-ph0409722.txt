    "recent discussions of the various instabilities induced by rotation may be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . among the most important instabilities are the secular shear instability and the meridional circulation .",
    "these instabilities drive the transport of the chemical species and of the angular momentum .",
    "let us briefly recall the physical principles underlying these two instabilities .    in a rotating star local radiative equilibrium can not be achieved ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . as a result",
    "some parts of the star are heated while others are cooled .",
    "the buoyancy forces then drive a large scale motion , called the meridional circulation .",
    "meridional circulation , contraction / expansion of the stellar layers , and convection create gradients of the angular velocity inside the star . these gradients produce instabilities known as shear instabilities .",
    "the physical reason for this instability lies in the fact that the minimum energy state of a differentially rotating fluid is solid body rotation .",
    "the star will tend to approach this state by homogenizing the angular velocity by turbulent mixing .    in a radiative zone ,",
    "the vertical stable density stratification counteracts both the shear and meridional instability . in that respect",
    "the @xmath3gradients play a key role as a stabilizing agent .",
    "these gradients may even , depending on the physics involved in the model , completely inhibit the mixing @xcite .",
    "there are different methods in the literature for accounting for the effects of the @xmath3gradients on the mixing .",
    "some authors choose a parametric approach consisting in multiplying the @xmath3gradient by a free parameter , @xmath4 , smaller than one in order to weaken the stabilizing effect of the @xmath3gradient .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is chosen in order to enable the stellar models to reproduce the observed surface enrichments @xcite .",
    "the very small values chosen ( of the order of @xmath5 ) well illustrates the strong inhibiting effects of the @xmath3gradients .",
    "other methods devised by @xcite , @xcite take into account of the effects of the strong horizontal turbulence ( see below ) and of the heat exchanges which can occur during the mixing process .",
    "this reduces the vertical drawback force and makes easier the development of the instability . in that case",
    ", the energy available in the shear can always be used for performing some mixing .",
    "expressions for the shear diffusion coefficients can then be deduced without the need of artificially reducing the inhibiting effect of the @xmath3gradients .    in the horizontal direction , i.e. on a isobar , in contrast to what happens in the vertical direction , the shear instability is not inhibited by a stable density stratification and the turbulence can develop without difficulty .",
    "thus as long as horizontal gradients are continuously built up by e.g. meridional circulation , a strong horizontal turbulence develops in the star @xcite .",
    "this strong horizontal turbulence will also erode very efficiently any horizontal gradient of @xmath6 .",
    "thus the star can always be considered to be in a state of shellular rotation , characterized by constant values of @xmath6 on isobars .",
    "starting from this a priori , but reasonable hypothesis , @xcite proposed a consistent theory of the interaction between the shear instability and the meridional circulation .",
    "the theory can be kept one dimensional thanks to the hypothesis of strong horizontal turbulence .",

    "[ schema ] : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the momentum of the forces acting on the volume element .",
    "we assume that angular momentum is transported only through advection ( by a velocity field * u * ) and through turbulent diffusion , which may be different in the radial ( vertical ) and tangential ( horizontal ) direction .",

    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 .",

    "[ eqn42 ] gives @xmath30 developing the divergence in spherical coordinates and using eq .  [ eqn43 ] ,",
    "one finally obtains the equation describing the transport of the angular momentum ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sum of the radial component of the meridional circulation velocity and the velocity of expansion / contraction , and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the horizontal component of the meridional circulation velocity . assuming , as in @xcite , that the rotation depends little on latitude due to strong horizontal diffusion , we write @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the horizontal average @xmath37 is defined as being the angular velocity of a shell rotating like a solid body and having the same angular momentum as the considered actual shell .",

    "this term produces negative values of @xmath72 ( noted @xmath73 from now ) , meaning that the circulation is going down along the polar axis and up in the equatorial plane .",
    "this makes an outward transport of angular momentum , while a positive @xmath73 gives an inward transport . at lower @xmath74 , the gratton ",

    " stars far from the eddington limit , @xmath93 for stars close to @xmath94 the increase of the mass loss rates may reach orders of magnitude .",
    "it is interesting to note that three kinds of break  up limit can be defined depending on which mechanism , radiative acceleration , centrifugal acceleration or both contribute to counterbalance the gravity : 1. the @xmath91limit occurs when radiation effects largely dominate ; 2. the @xmath6limit , when rotation effects are essentially determining break  up ; 3. the @xmath95limit , when both rotation and radiation are important for the critical velocity . in the cases of luminous blue variables the @xmath91 and @xmath95limits likely occurs , while in the case of be stars , the @xmath6limit is the relevant limit .",

    "rotating models predict new chemical yields ( @xcite @xcite ) and naturally lead to the production of primary nitrogen at low metallicity @xcite , they also bring new views on the evolution of pop iii stars @xcite .",
    "comparisons with the observed rotational velocities of stars become possible and interesting consequences for the rotation rate of young pulsars and the progenitors of gamma ray burst can be obtained ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite have given strong arguments indicating that the @xmath96 measured for be stars might be systematically underestimated .",
    "an important implication of their work is that these stars may be rotating much closer the critical velocity than generally assumed .",
    "as the authors note , rotation close to critical effectively reduces the effective equatorial gravity and could make material to easily leak into a disc . typically , when @xmath97 , the velocity necessary to launch material into orbit is of the same order as the speed of sound in the outer layers .",
    "therefore mechanisms , as nonradial pulsation , begin to be effective for orbital ejection @xcite . in view of these considerations",
    ", it appears interesting to investigate with our rotating stellar models , which are the initial conditions required for a star to reach the critical velocity during the ms phase .",
    "this is the object of this section",

    "[ vsur ] show the evolution of the rotational velocities and of the fraction @xmath98 of the angular velocity to the critical angular velocity at the surface of star models of different initial masses between 9 and 120 m@xmath99 with account taken of anisotropic mass loss during the ms phase .",
    "the evolution of the rotation velocities at the stellar surface depends mainly on 2 factors , the internal coupling and the mass loss .",
    "1. the coupling mechanisms transport angular momentum in the stellar interiors .",
    "the extreme case of strong coupling is the classical case of solid body rotation . in this case when mass loss is small , the star reaches the critical velocity during the ms phase more or less quickly depending on the initial rotation as shown by @xcite ( see also @xcite @xcite ) . in the case of no coupling ,",
    "i.e. of local conservation of the angular momentum , rotation becomes more and more subcritical . in the present models , with initial velocities at the beginning of the ms phase of @xmath100 260 km",
    "s@xmath1 the situation is intermediate , with a moderate coupling due mainly to meridional circulation , which is more efficient @xcite than shear transport , as far as transport of angular momentum is concerned .",
    "2. for a given degree of coupling , _ the mass loss rates play a most critical role in the evolution of the surface rotation_. as shown by the comparison of the models at @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xcite , for masses greater than @xmath10040 m@xmath99 the models with solar composition have velocities that decrease rather rapidly , while at @xmath102 the velocities go up .",
    "thus , for the most massive stars with moderate or strong coupling , the mass loss rates are the main factor influencing the evolution of rotation .",
    "the effect of mass loss is also well illustrated in fig .",
    "[ omomc ] , which shows the evolution of @xmath103 at the surface of a 15 m@xmath0 solar metallicity model .",
    "one sees that during the ms phase , the ratio increases as a function of time , until @xmath104 becomes inferior to 4.40 . according to vink et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) , below this value there is a sudden increase of the mass loss rates , which makes the rotation velocities rapidly decrease .",
    "it is interesting to note that below a mass of about 12 m@xmath99 , the mass loss rates are smaller and the internal coupling plays the main role in the evolution of the rotational velocities .",
    "this provides an interesting possibility of tests on the internal coupling by studying the differences in rotational velocities for stars at different distances of the zams .",
    "in particular , such a study could allow us to test the role of magnetic coupling in radiative envelopes , which is now a major open question in stellar rotation studies @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ vsur ] , we see that the stars which have a velocity around 260 km s@xmath1 at the beginning of the ms phase , do not reach the break  up limit .",
    "taking into account of the wind anisotropies induced by rotation , a 9 m@xmath0 stellar model at solar metallicity with an equatorial velocity at the beginning of the core h  burning phase equal to 340 km",
    "s@xmath1 reaches the break  up limit during the ms phase .",
    "this corresponds to values of @xmath105 and of @xmath106 equal to 0.81 and 0.61 respectively . the model with with an initial equatorial velocity of 290 km s@xmath1",
    "( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) , approaches but does not reach the break  up limit during the ms phase . at the end of the ms phase , the 290 and 340 km s@xmath1 models present n / c ratios at the surface equal to 2.8 and 3.2 times the initial value .    in fig .",
    "[ crit ] , evolutions of @xmath106 for different initial metallicities and masses are shown .",
    "interestingly , one notes that the 5 m@xmath0 stellar model at z = 0.040 reaches the break  up limit well before the model at z=0.020 .",
    "this comes essentially from the dependence on density of the meridional velocity as given by the gratton - pik term . at higher metallicity ,",
    "the radii of stars are bigger and thus the density in the outer layers are smaller . at a given metallicity",
    "( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ crit ] ) , the higher initial mass star reach the break  up limit before the lower initial mass models . again",
    "this can be explained through the density dependance of the meridional circulation velocity .",
    "\\1 ) for stars suffering little mass loss , the main effect which can bring these stars near the break - up limit is the outwards transport of angular momentum by the meridional circulation . since the velocity of the meridional currents in the outer layers scales with the inverse of the density , the process becomes more efficient for stars of higher initial mass and/or higher initial metallicity .",
    "how the fraction of stars which reach the break  up limit varies as a function of the initial metallicity requires a good knowledge of the distribution of the initial velocities as a function of the mass and of the metallicity .",
    "large and extended surveys are being now performed with this purpose ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "also the study of the time evolution of the surface velocities on the main sequence for stars undergoing little mass loss would provide very important hints on the efficiency of the internal tranport mechanisms of the angular momentum ."
