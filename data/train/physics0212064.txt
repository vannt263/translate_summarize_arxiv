    "the parameter @xmath63 was initially taken as 2.5 , and the number of bins in the histograms of the reaction coordinate was set to 1000 .",
    "caar@xmath1 is an obvious choice for testing the above methods , because the ar@xmath1 is icosahedral , hence nearly spherical , and because in this system calcium occupies a capping site of the icosahedral cluster .",
    "this is a virtual support to the effective diatomic picture .",
    "as seen in our previous papers,@xcite the calcium atom can jump into the icosahedral shell at moderate temperatures @xmath80  k , but the spectroscopic signature of these isomerizations is rather weak .    to 7.6 cm    in fig .",

    "the agreement is remarkable , as far as the positions and widths of the peaks are concerned .",
    "the diatomics method introduces some additional noise due the unaccuracy in the calculated effective potential curves .",
    "this noise could be partly reduced by taking a smaller number of bins in the interval of distances @xmath75 . however , this would also require one to reduce the number of bins in the histogram of the absorption spectrum .    as compared to our previous study using the superposition",

    "this prevents a clear identification of the possible isomers in the effective diatomics calculation .    to 6.2 cm",
    "the caar@xmath2 cluster has a large number of stable low - energy minima,@xcite characterized by very different geometries .",
    "its global minimum is decahedral , and the next most stable isomer is a mackay - type icosahedron . due to their different spectroscopic signatures at low temperature",

    "[ fig : pot37 ] we have represented the effective ground state potential curves as a function of the local coordinate @xmath75 , for the two decahedral and icosahedral isomers , at @xmath86  k. at such low temperature , and using simple monte carlo , the cluster is expected to be trapped in its initial basin.@xcite as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pot37 ] , the icosahedral structure remains more stable than the decahedral minimum .",
    "the equilibrium distance is slightly shifted between the two    to 6.2 cm    isomers , which results from the different local arrangements of argon atoms near the calcium site .",
    "neither the effective excited state potential curves nor the effective absorption cross sections are shown in this figure , as they display the same variations as in caar@xmath1 with the same reaction coordinate . the normalized absorption spectra calculated with the effective diatomics approach",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec37 ] to the reference monte carlo data .    to 7 cm    besides the presence of residual noise , we find again a good agreement in the positions and widths of the absorption peaks for the two isomers . at temperatures",
    "higher than 5  k , multiple isomers become populated at thermal equilibrium,@xcite but they are separated by large energy barriers , making the sampling difficult even within the wang - landau approach . in an experiment",
    ", such a situation would correspond to the presence of several stable isomers in the cluster beam .",
    "turning back to calculations , rather than trying algorithmic alteration to treat all the isomers in one calculation , it seems more appropriate to perform calculations for each isomer and then average calculations with proper weights , in a spirit similar to the superposition approximation.@xcite    when the barrier between isomers is not as high as in these pathological systems , isomerization is in principle included in the calculated effective properties .",
    "however , the choice of the local coordinate @xmath87 may not be appropriate to reveal features associated with the presence of several isomers . a more suitable reaction coordinate would show distinct values depending on the isomers we want to separate .",
    "there is indeed some arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath87 , which is very much guided by the kind of process we want to focus on . in caar@xmath1 , the distance @xmath88 between the calcium atom and the center of mass of the argon atoms has essentially two values depending on the calcium atom being in a capping location over the argon icosahedron or inside the icosahedral shell . in the latter case , @xmath89 can actually take 4 different values , one for each icosahedral site , but the 4 values are close to each other ( around 10@xmath90 ) , and relatively far from the 13.5@xmath90 value in the global minimum .",
    "the effective potential curves for caar@xmath1 at @xmath81  k using the @xmath89 coordinate are represented in fig .  [ fig : pot13cdm ] .",
    "we could not extend the sampling of this coordinate below 8@xmath90 or beyond 18@xmath90 because of extensive noise .",
    "the effective ground state potential clearly    to 7.8 cm    shows the presence of two sets of minima , which can be attributed to the calcium ( a ) or argon ( b ) capping atom sketched in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pot13cdm ] , depending on the outcome of a quenching procedure . regions ( a ) and ( b ) are defined by the distance @xmath89 being larger or smaller than 12.01@xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the effective excited states potential curves are also strongly influenced by this change in coordinate , and their variations reflect the two stable minima near 10@xmath90 and 13.5@xmath90 , respectively .",
    "therefore the @xmath89 reaction coordinate provides a structural order parameter that can distinguish between the different parts of the configuration space we are interested in .",
    "being able to differentiate isomers ( a ) and ( b ) allows one to calculate the separate contributions of each region to the global absorption spectrum .",
    "we have reported in    to 7.cm    fig .",
    "[ fig : spec13cdm ] the total absorption spectrum and its individual contributions from ( a ) or ( b ) .",
    "the overall agreement between the global spectrum and the monte carlo data is again good , and we notice that the blue shoulder near 23900  @xmath91 is larger than when using the local coordinate .",
    "this shows that the sampling of isomers ( b ) is more efficient , maybe even slightly too efficient with respect to the actual ergodic result .",
    "longer simulations and a better sampling of region ( a ) would be needed to reduce this error .    by carrying the integral ( [ eq : approx2 ] ) over each region (",
    "a ) or ( b ) separetely allows for a spectroscopic distinction between the isomers .",
    "it can be seen that region ( b ) is responsible for the blue wing at 23900  @xmath91 .",
    "the global spectrum is the weighted sum of the two separate contributions from ( a ) or ( b ) , and the statistical weight of ( b ) was found to be around 25% , in agreement with the study in ref .  .",
    "it is interesting to discuss further the shape of the spectrum for each isomer .",
    "we discussed in ref .   that the blue and red bands of spectra , similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec13cdm ] for isomer a , are associated to exciting the 4p orbital perpendicular or parallel to the cluster surface , respectively . in the case of isomer",
    "a , because of the outer location of calcium the two possible parallel alignments of the 4p orbital are almost degenerated in average and lead to two merging bands .",
    "in contrast , calcium is closer to argon atoms in isomer b. as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot13cdm ] this corresponds to a larger the splitting between the two lower @xmath92 potentials curves in the region that is accessible from the ground state isomer b. as a result , the red band in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec13cdm ] is splitted into two components for isomer b. a splitted red band has actually been observed experimentally in a slightly different context , the ba@xmath93 excitation on large argon clusters.@xcite    we just have seen that the spectroscopic properties of the chromophore are substantially affected by partial solvation in the argon cluster , that they appear as sensitive probe of the local environment of calcium and that they are satisfactorily described by the present effective diatomic picture .",
    "going further in that direction , we consider a fully solvated ca atom in an argon matrix as examined in the monte carlo simulations of ref .  .",
    "the present system is now a calcium atom surrounded by 107 argon atoms in a face - centered cubic lattice , at constant density @xmath94  kg.m@xmath95 and temperature @xmath96  k. bulk argon solvent is simulated using periodic boundaries conditions in the minimum image convention .",
    "the reaction coordinate is again the local distance from calcium to all other argon atoms , and the simulations were carried out with the same statistics as for clusters .",
    "the effective ground- and excited - states potential curves are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : potbulk ] .",
    "since calcium remains fully solvated    to 7.6 cm    in an equilibrium position , the ground - state surface roughly has a distorted parabola shape , and can not tend to zero at large distances @xmath75 . as we expect ,",
    "the excited - states surfaces are fully degenerated , giving rise to a dynamical jahn - teller effect in absorption.@xcite the photoabsorption spectrum calculated from the effective diatomics approach is compared to monte carlo results in fig .",
    "[ fig : specbulk ] .",
    "the three excited potential surfaces lead to three absorption peaks , but they are quite broad , and the precise identification is less easy than with the mc data . still we observe a surprisingly good agreement for the locations and overall widths of the peaks , suggesting that the effective diatomics method is adequate for treating chromophore - doped inert systems with general shapes .    to 7 cm",
    "spectroscopy of polyatomic molecules with many degrees of freedom is a difficult theoretical problem . beyond simple harmonic approximations,@xcite the most convenient way to describe correctly the absorption intensity relies on numerical simulations based on relevant hamiltonians for the potential energy surfaces .",
    "however the complex , multidimensional character of the pes is a burden for simple physical interpretations of the results obtained by conventional methods . in this paper , we have presented a simple alternative approach based on the separate treatment of a single reaction coordinate , the many - body nature of the problem being thermally averaged into effective ( free-)energy potential curves . by reducing the many - body problem into a single coordinate problem , the system is considered as a pseudo diatomics molecule , where the interactions implicitely depend on the thermodynamical conditions ( temperature , but also pressure , and possibly chemical potential ) and include the fluctuations within the averaged pseudo - atom .",
    "this point of view is best suited to the case of caar@xmath0 clusters , where the visible photoexcitation is localized on the single calcium atom . in heterogeneous clusters ,",
    "extra reaction coordinates could naturally appear .",
    "for instance , in cakrar@xmath0 , the two distances between calcium and krypton , and between calcium and the argon cluster could be treated on a same footing . in such cases",
    ", the present investigation could be easily generalized to provide effective hypersurfaces depending on several coordinates . in this picture",
    "the example chosen above would be considered as a pseudo triatomics ca  kr  ar@xmath0 .",
    "similar ideas could be applied to atom - diatom reactions solvated by an inert cluster .",
    "computationally speaking , the present method involves the preliminary calculation of the potential of mean force , which incorporates the statistical averages over all but one coordinates .",
    "the pmf is then used in a reweighting simulation to obtain the effective interactions and absorption cross section in a broad range of distances .",
    "the overall numerical cost is therefore heavier than in a conventional simulation , by one order of magnitude at the very least .",
    "however , the calculation of the pmf can be achieved conveniently , independently of the reaction coordinate chosen , using the multiple range random walk algorithm of wang and landau,@xcite recently adapted to the problem of free - energy profiles.@xcite therefore the interest of the present approach mainly resides in the extra interpretations it provides .",
    "for instance , it could be used to assess or quantify the local character of the excitation",
    ". it also lays some ground for further spectroscopic investigations .",
    "in particular , more detailed studies of the excited states effective surfaces could be undertaken .",
    "the influence of temperature or the number of inert atoms on these curves , the related possible conical intersections offer examples of future research directions .    on a practical point , we have largely used a local distance coordinate @xmath75 , namely the geometric distance ( _ i.e. _ the lowest distance ) between calcium and argon atoms .",
    "this order parameter is relevant to describe the caar@xmath0 cluster as a pseudo ca(ar@xmath0 ) diatomics , for which most of the methodology developed here was meant .",
    "however , the separate effects of different isomers are essentially smoothed out and averaged , and it may be much more profitable to use other system - dependent coordinates to get a richer information about structure . in the case of caar@xmath1 , we have shown that the distance between calcium and the argon cluster center of mass was more appropriate in this purpose .",
    "in other , more complex clusters , one should take profit of the known structural information to design suitable reaction coordinates .",
    "for instance the bond order parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , or @xmath100 , introduced by steinhardt and coworkers,@xcite could be used to distinguish between icosahedral , octahedral , or decahedral isomers.@xcite one could then extend the present work to metallic clusters , where the energy levels can change upon global shape deformation,@xcite and for which appropriate reaction coordinates could be the eccentricities or the hill - wheeler parameters .",
    "quantum vibrational effects are not accounted for in the present description , essentially because the corresponding treatment within path - integral finite temperature monte carlo is numerically demanding , and because reference calculations are not available",
    ". however , at moderate temperatures , the present approach could be straightforwardly applied to quantum - corrected potential energy surfaces using the feynman - hibbs effective potentials.@xcite    at a more general level , the present approach gives the framework both to describe a reactive system in terms of deformations along a reaction coordinate and to calculate the corresponding energy variation . in that sense ,",
    "the present calculation allows one to deal with the description of a chemical reaction in terms of the transition state theory in situations where part of the reactive system itself acts as a thermal bath . in the present case",
    "the reactive system is a calcium atom plus an argon cluster .",
    "the latter plays the role of the thermal bath .",
    "the reaction is the simplest that might be considered : solvation of ca by the argon cluster .",
    "the choice of reaction coordinate is not unique and a possible choice is the distance between ca and the closest argon atom .",
