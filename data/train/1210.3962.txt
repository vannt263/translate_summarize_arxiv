    "as one of the 21 np - hard combinatorial optimization problems @xcite , the maxcut problem has drawn a great deal of attention for several decades , due to its practical applications in circuit layout design , statistical physics , classification , and network analysis ( for much more , the reader can refer to @xcite ) .",
    "+ there are special classes of graphs , for instance , the planar graphs and graphs with no @xmath0 minor , for which the maxcut problem can be solvable ; however , it is impossible to find an algorithm in polynomial time due to its np - hardness in general .",
    "methods to solve the maxcut problem can be classified into two categories : direct and indirect .",
    "the direct method starts from a feasible solution , and then it ameliorates the solution iteratively with various strategies .",
    "randomized heuristics which combine a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure , a variable neighborhood search , and a path - relinking intensification heuristic in @xcite , advanced scatter search in @xcite , a variant of spectral partitioning in @xcite , and a new tabu search algorithm in @xcite belong to this kind . on the other hand ,",
    "the indirect method focuses on the relaxation of the primal or the lagrangian dual of the maxcut models , and then it uses some procedures to make the relaxation solution feasible to orginal problem , in which , relaxation means that relaxing some of the constraints and extending the objective function to larger space .",
    "based on the semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxation , goemans and williamson @xcite proposed the well - known randomized approximation algorithm which can achieve a performance guarantee of 0.878 . based on the rank - two relaxation , a continuous optimization heuristic was constructed for approximating the maxcut problem @xcite .",
    "based on the lagrangian dual relaxation , smoothing heuristics were presented in @xcite . in @xcite , a polyhedral cut and price approach was investigated to solve the maxcut problem , in which , at the pricing phase , an interior point cutting plane algorithm was used to solve the lagrangian dual of the sdp relaxation ; at the cutting phase , cutting planes based on the polyhedral theory were added to the primal problem in order to improve the the sdp relaxation . in @xcite ,",
    "a feasible direction method was designed to solve the continuous nonlinear programming problem by the relaxed maxcut model . in a branch and",
    "bound setting , a dynamic bundle method was used to solve the lagrangian dual of the semidefinite maxcut relaxation@xcite .",
    "+ the canonical dual is a generalized lagrangian dual , which originated in the late 1980s by gao and strang , and has developed significantly in recent years , which provides a new and potentially useful methodology for solving integer programming problems @xcite . as shown in @xcite , through special canonical dual transformation , the integer programming problems can be converted to a concave maximization problem over a convex positive domain without duality gap , which can be solved easily by well - developed optimization algorithms under some circumstances . in @xcite ,",
    "a canonical dual approach was proposed for the maxcut problem by adding a linear perturbation term to the primal objective function ; however , the strategy is not so robust to guarantee the solution to be located in the primal feasible domain . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a quadratic perturbation to the canonical dual of the maxcut problem .",
    "furthermore , for some cases when there exist no critical points in the dual feasible space , a reduction technique is used gradually to guarantee the feasibility of the reduced solution and a compensation technique is utilized to strengthen the robustness of the solution .",
    "we also apply the strategy to the maxcut problem with linear perturbation and its hybrid with quadratic perturbation .",
    "finally , experimental results are given to testify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms .",
    "let @xmath1 be an undirected graph with edge weight @xmath2 on @xmath3 vertices and @xmath4 edges , for each edge @xmath5 , the maxcut problem is to find a subset @xmath6 of the vertex set @xmath7 such that the total weight of the edges between @xmath6 and its complementary subset @xmath8 is as large as possible .",
    "considering a variable @xmath9 for each edge @xmath5 , and assuming @xmath9 to be 1 if @xmath10 is in the cut , and 0 otherwise , the maxcut problem can be modeled as the following linear programming ( lp ) optimization problem : @xmath11 here the incidence vector @xmath12 , where the @xmath13 is the number of edges in the graph .",
    "+ let cut(@xmath14 ) denote the convex hull of the incidence vectors of cuts in @xmath14 .",
    "since maximizing a linear function over a set of points equals to maximizing it over the convex hull of this set of points , we can rewrite ( [ eq0 ] ) to the following form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .      for a bipartition @xmath17 , with @xmath18",
    "if @xmath19 , and @xmath20 otherwise , the maxcut problem can be formulated as the following semidefinite programming optimization problem : @xmath21 without loss of generality , if we fix the value of the last variable at 1 , then the problem ( [ eq1 ] ) is equivalent to the following form ( primal problem ) : @xmath22 where , @xmath23 denotes the bilinear form , @xmath24 is a symmetric matrix with @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "it is not difficult to find that a optimal solution @xmath27 to problem ( [ eq2 ] ) corresponds to a optimal solution @xmath28 of original problem ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "+ the canonical dual algorithms in this paper are based on the sdp model .",
    "in @xcite , a linear non - zero vector @xmath29 is added to the primal problem and then we can get the linearly perturbed problem @xmath30 it proved that , if @xmath31 , the perturbed optimal solution is equivalent to the solution of primal problem , and if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the optimal solution of the perturbed problem and @xmath34 is a constant , then @xmath35 , here , @xmath36 is the optimal value of the primal problem .",
    "+ the problem of this linear perturbation is that , for one thing , it is not easy to find such an appropriate perturbation , and for another , if @xmath37 , only approximate solution can be obtained .",
    "we give the notations @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] to denote the hadamard product and quotient for any two vector @xmath40 , @xmath41 to represent a diagonal matrix with components of the vector @xmath42 as its elements , and @xmath43 to stand for a vector of all ones .",
    "+ by the fact @xmath44 and @xmath45^t \\bm\\alpha = \\mathbf{x}^t diag(\\bm\\alpha)\\mathbf{x } = \\mathbf{e}^t \\bm\\alpha$ ] , then the problem @xmath46 is identical to the following @xmath47perturbed problem : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is a parametrical vector .",
    "+ introducing a quadratic geometrical operator @xmath51 and following the standard procedures of canonical dual methodology , the @xmath47perturbed canonical dual problem is obtained as follows @xmath52 where , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 further more , a quadratic penalty term is added to the @xmath47perturbed canonical dual problem , and then we get the @xmath55 perturbed canonical dual problem @xmath56    suppose that for a given perturbation vector @xmath57 such that @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is big enough , if @xmath60 is a critical point of the @xmath55 perturbed canonical dual problem , then @xmath61 @xmath27 is a global solution to the @xmath46 .",
    "first , we prove that @xmath27 defined by ( [ eq8 ] ) is feasible of @xmath46 .",

    "+ if @xmath67 is big enough , it is easy to find that @xmath68 , which is a feasible solution to @xmath46 .",
    "+ then , we prove that @xmath27 is a global solution . + by the fact that @xmath58",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath69 due to @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath55 perturbed canonical dual problem @xmath64 is strictly concave on @xmath71 , and if the critical point @xmath60 , it must be a unique maximizer of problem @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , the corresponding @xmath27 defined by ( [ eq8 ] ) must be unique .",
    "on the other hand , we have @xmath72 that is to say , @xmath73 is the global solution of @xmath74 and so the global solution of @xmath46 .",
    "now , we present a gradient - based iterative method for the @xmath55 perturbed canonical dual problem . + it is not difficult to find that the search direction ( negative gradient ) of the negative canonical dual function @xmath75 is @xmath76 and step size of each component of search direction is obtained by a golden section search technique from @xmath77 $ ] , where @xmath78 is determined by making the corresponding diagonal component of @xmath79 positive .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the maxcut problem with a quadratic perturbation term added to the canonical dual problem .",
    "a gradient - based algorithm is designed to solve the quadratic perturbed canonical dual problem .",
    "for some cases with no critical points in the dual feasible domain , a reduction technique and a compensation technique are introduced to improve the quality of the solution .",
    "the similar techniques are also applied to maxcut model with linear perturbation and its hybrid with quadratic perturbation .",
