    "in recent years much progress has been achieved in the understanding of magnetic disordered systems . among those ,",
    "one may single out the spin glasses ( sgs ) @xcite , for which significant advances were obtained , as a result of a large effort dedicated to them .",
    "most of the sg studies were carried for two - spin - interaction models , that were at the early stage , intended to explain the physical behavior of some peculiar magnetic compounds .",
    "nowadays , apart from this motivation , such sg models were identified to be closely related to a large diversity of physical problems , like neural networks , protein folding , and optimization problems @xcite .",
    "the mean - field theory of the ising sg model , considered in terms of an infinite - range - interaction model @xcite , is nowadays accepted as satisfactorily understood .",
    "the simplest solution , based on a single sg order parameter , known as replica - symmetric ( rs ) solution @xcite , presented serious difficulties , and it was shown to be unstable at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the correct mean - field solution for the ising sg was proposed by parisi @xcite , and it consists in an infinite number of order parameters  a procedure called of replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .",
    "however , it is not clear up to the moment , whether the mean - field solution is appropriate for the description of real  short - range - interaction  sg systems @xcite .    the @xmath0-spin - interaction ( @xmath1 )",
    "models were initially introduced as merely theoretical problems @xcite ; however , the identification of a close analogy between the transitions occurring in p - spin interaction sg models and those obtained in mode coupling theories of structural glasses @xcite , motivated many studies on such models .",
    "a nice feature of infinite - range p - spin - interaction sg models is that in the @xmath2 limit the energy levels become independent random variables , yielding an exactly solvable model , known as the random - energy model @xcite .",
    "also , for @xmath1 the phase transition scenario of these sg models is quite different from the one found in the corresponding @xmath3 model . besides the usual equilibrium transition temperature",
    ", there exists another transition temperature presenting a dynamical character .",
    "right below the equilibrium transition , a single step in the rsb procedure is sufficient for stabilility @xcite , i.e. , the order parameter is properly represented in terms of a one - step parisi function . for models where there is some kind of competition between different types of interactions , the one - step rsb order parameter changes dramatically the phase diagrams obtained from rs solutions @xcite .",
    "usually , in the @xmath2 limit , the one - step rsb yields the correct solution , revealing new phases which are not present in the corresponding rs approach .",
    "it should be mentioned that , recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of @xmath0-spin - interaction sg models , motivated either by attaining a better understanding of such models , or by the possible applications in other fields of science . the study of infinite - range @xmath0-spin - interaction sg models , by means of the replica method , has produced many interesting new features as a consequence of the inclusion of magnetic fields @xcite , ferro- @xcite and antiferromagnetic @xcite interactions , as well as a competition between quadrupolar and sg orderings @xcite .",
    "recent dynamical studies also have been carried @xcite , leading , in particular , to an analysis of the barriers separating metastable states @xcite . besides that",
    ", such models have been investigated lately through rigorous approaches @xcite and in a quantum version @xcite ; new applications were explored , e.g. , connections to the protein folding problem @xcite , to error correcting codes @xcite , and to many biological systems @xcite .",
    "the ashkin - teller model @xcite is one of most studied systems in statistical mechanics , due mainly to the richness of critical phenomena revealed by its phase diagrams both in two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "this wealth of results steams from the competition between the two- and four - spin interactions present in the model .",
    "herein we consider an infinite - range ashkin - teller - like sg with @xmath0-spins interactions in order to investigate the effects of an analogous competition .",
    "we present the full solution in the @xmath2 limit .",
    "the resulting phase diagram shows three distinct phases , similarly to what has been found in other ashkin - teller sg models with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the present transition lines are changed , and we get a triple point common to the three phases , instead of a multicritical one as found in the previous @xmath3 works @xcite . in particular , we find that in the limit of two independent ising - like models ( or 4-state clock model ) the equilibrium transition occurs at a multiphase point .",
    "we also show that , for @xmath4 , some particular cases of the present model are equivalent to random - energy models with uncorrelated energy levels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and determine the free - energy density functional , obtained through the replica method . in section 3",
    "we determine the phase diagram within the rs solution and consider the stability of such a solution against gaussian fluctuations in replica space . in section 4",
    "we apply the first stage of parisi s _ ansatz _ to determine the phase diagram .",
    "our main conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "equivalences with random - energy models , in the limit @xmath4 , are shown in an appendix .",
    "in the present work we will consider a @xmath0-spin interaction ashkin - teller - like sg model , defined by the hamiltonian    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are ising spin variables .",
    "all interactions are infinite - range - like , and similarly to what has been done in previous works @xcite , herein we will be restricted to the case of independent couplings @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , each one following its own gaussian probability distribution ,    @xmath11    the free - energy density is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 represents an average over the disorder . in the following",

    "one may now introduce , for each distinct pair of replicas @xmath22 , the order parameters ,    @xmath23    as well as their respective auxiliary fields ( lagrange s multipliers ) @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 through standard identities , e.g. , for the pair @xmath27 ,    @xmath28    where , @xmath29 applying a similar procedure for the pairs of matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 , one may write    @xmath32}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath33 }      \\right\\ } } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting eq .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) , we obtain the free - energy density functional    @xmath34    where @xmath35 stands for the global minimum of @xmath36 , taken with respect to the variational parameters .",
    "one must now look for stable solutions of the saddle - point equations .",
    "the simplest _ ansatz _ consists in considering all replicas in an equal footing , and thus assume the rs solution .",
    "in the next section we will analyse this solution , and it will be shown that the only stable rs solution is the paramagnetic one .",
    "the rs solution is obtained by considering    @xmath37    as well as    @xmath38    performing standard simplifications through gaussian identities , we get the free - energy density functional as    @xmath39 \\\\    & & -\\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\left[\\gamma_{1 } ( q_{1}-1)+\\gamma_{2 } ( q_{2}-1)+\\xi ( r-1)\\right]\\nonumber       -\\frac{1}{\\beta}{{\\langle{\\!}\\langle}\\ln{\\xi ( x , y , z ) } { \\rangle{\\!}\\rangle}_{x , y , z}}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath40        .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eq .",

    "( [ fedrs ] ) may be determined from the saddle - point conditions .",

    "it would be interesting to investigate the full phase diagram obtained from the above equations .",
    "however , similar to what has been done in previous studies of @xmath3 ashkin - teller models , the most interesting case is the isotropic one , for which @xmath57 .",
    "in such a case , besides the usual spin reversal symmetries , there is a new symmetry in which the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spins variables may be interchanged .    for @xmath58",
    "there is always a disordered , paramagnetic , phase where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with the free energy given by    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the temperature ( herein we work in units such that @xmath63 ) . from the above expression",
    "we obtain the entropy density    @xmath64    for low temperatures this entropy becomes negative and the system gets frozen . the paramagnetic phase can exist only above the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is given by    @xmath65        there are many other non - trivial rs solutions . the stability analysis of those solutions against replica fluctuations can be performed along the lines pioneered by de almeida and thouless @xcite for the @xmath3 infinite - range ising sg model . in general , the eigenvalues are roots of cubic equations , and become too lengthy to quote their expressions , except in a few particular cases .",
    "for instance , to the @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 solution there corresponds , in the limit @xmath69 , the following _ longitudinal _",
    "@xmath70 , \\ ] ]    and _ transversal _ @xmath71\\ ] ]    eigenvalues , where @xmath72",
    "when @xmath73 , one gets the paramagnetic solution and , from the vanishing of the above eigenvalues , such a solution is marginally stable for @xmath1 . on the other hand , in the @xmath4",
    "the @xmath74 solution presents both eigenvalues negative , being completely unstable .",
    "the same happens for any other non - trivial rs solution .",
    "thus , we must look for rsb solutions ; this will be done in the next section .",
    "since there is no stable sg solution in the @xmath4 limit , within the rs assumption , we need to look for rsb solutions .",
    "fortunately , it is enough to consider just the first step in parisi s rsb procedure in order to get the correct solution in such a limit , as verified in other @xmath0-spin - interaction models studied before @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "since we deal with three distincts pairs of conjugated matrices , namely @xmath27 , @xmath75 , and @xmath31 , one should apply the rsb scheme for all six matrices . in principle",
    ", one could apply the rsb scheme for each matrix in an independent way , i.e. , each matrix should have its own block sizes .",
    "however , it is easy to convince oneselves that this is not a physically acceptable procedure , due to the symmetries involving the interchanging between the spins in the hamiltonian",
    ". therefore , herein we will apply the same rsb for each matrix , i.e. , we will divide all six @xmath76 matrices into @xmath77 groups of size @xmath78 . following parisi @xcite , we denote the elements of the off - diagonal blocks by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and those of the diagonal blocks by @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "thus , we obtain the free - energy density functional    @xmath83    where @xmath84    @xmath85    with @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 defined by @xmath89    by extremizing the above free - energy density one gets the equations of state within the one - step rsb procedure ( see appendix a ) ; it is easy to see that such equations present several non - trivial solutions in the limit @xmath90 . a careful analysis of the free energy shows that only four of those solutions are physically acceptable . for low temperatures",
    "there is always a sgi phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , in which @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and    @xmath93    the corresponding free - energy density is given by    @xmath94    which yields a vanishing entropy .",
    "the transition between the sgi phase and the paramagnetic one occurs along a line given by    @xmath95    where both phases present zero entropy ,",
    "i.e. , there is no latent heat .",
    "this line holds as long as @xmath96 . beyond that point ,",
    "we find two other first - order transition lines confining a sgii phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , throughout which one has @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and all other order parameters zero .",
    "this phase presents a free - energy density    @xmath99    which leads to the entropy density    @xmath100    due to discontinuities in the order parameters , the transition separating the paramagnetic and sgii phases is first - order ; this critical frontier may be determined by demanding the free - energy densities given by eqs .",
    "( [ fp ] ) and ( [ fii ] ) to be equal , leading to the straight line ,    @xmath101    along this critical frontier there is also no latent heat . for lower temperatures another transition occurs , this time from the sgii to the sgi phase . from their free - energy densities , given respectively by eqs .",
    "( [ fii ] ) and ( [ fi ] ) , we find the corresponding critical frontier ,    @xmath102 .\\ ] ]    it is easy to verify that along the sgi - sgii critical frontier there is a finite latent heat .",
    "therefore , in this case one has a genuine first - order transition line .",
    "the three transition lines given by eqns .",
    "( [ fot1 ] ) , ( [ fot2 ] ) and ( [ fot3 ] ) merge together at a triple point ( tp ) , located at @xmath103 and @xmath104 , as shown in fig .",
    "although two of these transition lines do not represent conventional first - order transitions in the thermodynamic sense , since we do not observe any discontinuity in the first derivatives of their corresponding free - energy densities , i.e. , no latent heat , the picture around the triple point follows the standard gibbs phase rule @xcite .",
    "besides the solutions discussed above , there are also two equivalent solutions ( which we call sgiii ) : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , with all remaining order parameters zero , and its symmetric one , i.e. , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , with all remaining order parameters equal to zero .",
    "however , the sgiii phase is realized only at the multiphase point ( mp ) , @xmath109 $ ] , where it coexists with the paramagnetic and sgi phases .",
    "we have studied a version of the ashkin - teller sg model , with @xmath0-spin interations , by means of the replica approach .",
    "the rs solution leads to a simple phase diagram , for arbitrary values of @xmath0 , with a paramagnetic phase that is stable at high temperatures , becoming unstable at low temperatures ; within such a solution , there are no stable non - trivial solutions at low temperatures . by applying a one - step rsb procedure , we have found a rich phase diagram in the @xmath4 limit , with four distinct phases , namely , a paramagnetic one at high temperatures , and three sg phases ( sgi , sgii , and sgiii ) at lower temperatures .",
    "the borders of the paramagnetic phase present discontinuities in the order parameters , but no latent heat , whereas the critical frontier separating phases sgi and sgii is a genuine first - order phase transition , exhibiting both discontinuities in the order parameters , as well as a finite latent heat . these critical frontiers all meet at a triple point according to the standart gibbs phase rule @xcite , similarly to what happens in a previously investigated model @xcite .",
    "the sgiii solution is stable only at a multiphase point , where it coexists with the paramagnetic and sgi phases .",
    "also , in the @xmath4 limit , it is possible to show the equivalence of the model considered herein with a random energy model , as defined by derrida @xcite , which can be solved by other methods ; this equivalence is shown in appendix b. a detailed analysis of the corresponding random - energy model will be published elsewhere .",
    "we would like to thank cnpq ( brazilian government ) for financial support .",
    "in this appendix we derive the equations of state of the one - step rsb solution discussed in section 4 .",
    "we shall consider the same matrix block sizes , i.e. , the same value of @xmath78 for all matrices ; denoting the elements of the off - diagonal blocks by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , whereas those of the diagonal blocks by @xmath81 and @xmath82 , one gets the free - energy density defined in eqs .",
