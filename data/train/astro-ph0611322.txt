    "the era at which a strong correlation between galaxy morphology and stellar content develops is not well constrained .",
    "one of the primary goals of the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ; abraham et al .",
    "2004 ) was to use stellar - mass - selected samples to probe galaxy evolution in the critical @xmath3 range , over which something like half the stellar mass in galaxies is expected to form ( based upon integration of the cosmic star - formation history presented in steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) . the gdds and other samples ( e.g. k20 ; cimatti et al .",
    "2004 ) showed that the total stellar mass density evolves slowly for @xmath4 and that the high - mass end in particular is slowly evolving ( glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ; fontana et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this short paper",
    "we examine the evolution of the stellar mass density as a function of morphological type using deep hst / acs imaging of the gdds fields .",
    "we outline how a slight refinement ( based on adopting a so - called ` quasi - petrosian ' threshold ) to traditional methods allows morphological classification based on central concentration ( or gini coefficent ) vs. asymmetry . using this method",
    ", we are able to derive robust morphological classifications at @xmath5 , and present the stellar mass function for early - type galaxies over this redshift range .",
    "the benefits of determining galaxy properties within a metric size defined by a circular petrosian aperture are well - established ( petrosian 1976 ; blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) , so we will not describe them here except to note that galaxy properties determined in this way are quite robust to the effects of cosmological dimming and bandshifting . what is less well - known is that a ` quasi - petrosian ' aperture can also be constructed using an algorithm which works for galaxies of arbitrary shape .",
    "interestingly , this algorithm is closely related to the pixel - sorting algorithm used to define the gini coefficient ( abraham et al .",
    "2003 ) , which itself provides an elegant and robust proxy for central concentration and which is proving useful for galaxy classification ( abraham et al .",
    "2003 , lotz et al .",
    "2004)abraham / morpheus/ ] .",
    "a ` quasi - petrosian aperture ' can be defined in the following manner .",
    "all pixels in the galaxy image are sorted in _ decreasing _ order of flux to construct an array , @xmath6 , containing the flux in the @xmath7 sorted pixel .",
    "this array is then summed over to construct a monotonically _ increasing _ curve of cumulative flux values : @xmath8 in analogy with the definition of the petrosian radius for a circular aperture , a ` petrosian isophote ' can be calculated by determining the pixel index @xmath9 which satisfies the following equation : @xmath10 the flux value of the pixel which solves this equation is used to construct the quasi - petrosian aperture mask .",
    "in fact , once @xmath6 is known , constructing the aperture mask is trivial : pixels brighter than @xmath6 are set to 1.0 , and pixels fainter than @xmath6 are set to 0.0 .",
    "morphological quantities are computed in the usual way after multiplying the original image by the aperture mask .",
    "measurements obtained through non - circular quasi - petrosian apertures share many of the salutary properties of photometric measurements obtained through circular petrosian apertures .",
    "the free parameter @xmath11 in the equation is fixed for all galaxies in the sample , and ideally all groups using this approach would adopt the same value of @xmath11 to allow easy inter - comparison of measurements .",
    "a little experimentation has shown us that @xmath12 yields excellent results , and we suggest that this be adopted as a sensible value .",
    "finally , we note that because the data are discrete , equation  [ quasipetroeqn ] will rarely be solved exactly , but a perfectly adequate approximation can be obtained by simply noting the index of the first zero crossing of @xmath13 .",
    "in figure  1 we show quasi - petrosian aperture - based measurements of asymmetry vs. gini coefficent for all galaxies in with @xmath14 mag in our gdds acs images ( abraham et al .",
    "inspection of this plot ( ideally in electronic form so zooming - in on the small postage stamp images is possible ! ) shows that this two - dimensional classification plane does a good job of distinguishing early - type galaxies from all other galaxy types .",
    "interestingly , a comparison of the morphological mix with the spectral classifications of the galaxies shows that surprisingly little ambiguity exists in connecting spectral classes to morphological classes for quiescent systems .",
    "this can be seen in the electronic version of this paper , which shows this figure using colored borders on the galaxy images to denote spectroscopic classification .",
    "figure  2 shows the evolving stellar mass density function for massive ( @xmath15 ) galaxies in our acs images , computed using the formalism described in the previous section .",
    "if we restrict consideration to _ massive galaxies only _ , at @xmath1 , about 70% of the stellar mass in these systems lives in early - type galaxies .",
    "this is essentially identical to the local value ( abraham et al .",
    "interestingly , we see strong evolution in this fraction over the range @xmath16 , as the mass densities in spheroids evolve steeply over this redshift range .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the core formation epoch for _ massive _ spheroids is drawing to a close in this interval .",
    "signatures of major mergers appear to have faded by @xmath17 or higher , and subsequent mass evolution at @xmath18 apparently does not significantly disturb the spectral - morphology correlation .",
    "we thank francoise combes for her indulgence in accepting this manuscript even though it was late in coming , and extend our congratulations to the local organizers of the iau symposium in prague for hosting an interesting meeting .",
