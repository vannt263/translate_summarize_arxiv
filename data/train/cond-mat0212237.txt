    "during the last few years studies of random , evolving networks ( such as the internet , www , social networks , metabolic networks , food webs etc - for review see @xcite ) have become a very popular research domain among physicists .",
    "a lot of efforts were put into investigation of such systems in order to recognize their structure and to analyse emerging complex dynamics .",
    "we learned that networks are far from being random as erds and rnyi assumed in random graph theory @xcite , but surely they are not so ordered as crystals . despite network diversity ,",
    "most of real weblike systems share three prominent features",
    "@xcite :    * the average shortest path length @xmath4 is small . in order to connect two nodes in a network",
    "typically only a few edges need to be passed . *",
    "the average clustering coefficient @xmath5 is large .",
    "two nodes having a common neighbour are also likely to be neighbours . *",
    "the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly @xmath6 nearest neighbours follows a power law ( scale - free ) distribution @xmath7 with @xmath8 in most of real systems .",
    "a considerable number of network models has been studied in order to capture the above characteristics .",
    "most of these are based on two ingredients originally introduced by barabsi and albert @xcite : continuous network growth and preferential attachment . in barabsi - albert",
    "( ba ) model , network starts to grow from an initial cluster of @xmath3 fully connected sites .",
    "each new node that is added to the network creates @xmath3 links that connect it to previously added nodes .",
    "the preferential attachment means that the probability of a new link to end up in a vertex @xmath1 is proportional to connectivity @xmath9 of this vertex .",
    "the validity of the preferential attachment was confirmed within real networks analyses @xcite .",
    "the ba algorithm generates networks with the desirable scale - free distribution @xmath10 and small values of the average shortest path .",
    "one can also observe a phase transition for spins located at ba network vertices with a critical temperature increasing as a logarithm of the system size @xcite .",
    "the only striking discrepancy between the ba model and real networks is that the value of the clustering coefficient predicted by the theoretical model decays very fast with network size and for large systems is typically several orders of magnitude lower than found empirically .    in this paper",
    "we extend the standard definition of the clustering coefficient by introducing higher order clustering coefficients that describe interrelations between vertices belonging to the nearest neighbourhood of a certain vertex in complex network . global characteristics like the standard clustering coefficient and the average shortest path do not provide a useful insight into complex network structure and dynamics .",
    "we hope that the higher order clustering coefficient analyses in real systems @xcite may give some guidelines how to model clustering mechanisms . here , we study higher order clustering coefficients in ba model .",
    "our results provide a vivid evidence that the ba networks are blind to clustering mechanisms .",
    "the standard clustering coefficient @xmath5 is one of global parameters used to characterise the topology of complex networks . for the first time it was introduced by watts and strogatz @xcite to characterise local transitivity in social networks .",
    "clustering coefficient gives the probability that two nearest neighbours of the same node are also mutual neighbours .",
    "let us focus on a selected node @xmath1 in a network , having @xmath9 edges which connect it to @xmath9 other nodes .",
    "the value of the clustering coefficient of the node @xmath1 is given by the ratio between the number of edges @xmath11 that actually exist between these @xmath9 nodes and the total number @xmath12 of such edges that could exist in the neighbourhood of @xmath1 : @xmath13 the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of all individual @xmath14 s    we define a _ clustering coefficient of order @xmath2 _ for a node @xmath1 as the probability that there is a distance of length @xmath2 between two neighbours of a node @xmath1 . putting the number of such @xmath2-distances equal to @xmath15 , the higher order clustering coefficients",
    "follow : @xmath16 @xmath0 is the mean value of @xmath17 over the whole network .",
    "note that @xmath0 reduces to the standard clustering coefficient for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the ba networks with @xmath20 .",
    "the above definition becomes comprehensible after examining fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "let us assume a node @xmath1 with @xmath21 .",
    "the node determines its nearest neighbourhood that in this case consists of vertices @xmath22 .",
    "the aim is to find higher order clustering coefficients @xmath17 of the node @xmath1 .",
    "the table below gives the shortest distances between vertices adjacent to the node @xmath1 .",
    "the distances were taken from the fig.[fig1 ] ( _ stage @xmath23 _ ) : @xmath24 summing over all pairs of vertices one obtains : @xmath25",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the higher order clustering coefficients dependence on the network size @xmath26 .",
    "nodes determined as belonging to the nearest neighbourhood of any vertex in ba network are more likely to be second ( @xmath27 ) , third ( @xmath28 ) and further neighbours when @xmath26 increases .",
    "we investigated distributions of the clustering coefficients @xmath0 at a given system size @xmath26 in ba networks with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we found that regardless of @xmath26 the distributions of @xmath0 ( when extending @xmath2 to real values ) fairly good fit the normalized gaussian curve ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we observed that the standard deviation of these distributions depends only on the parameter @xmath3 of the network .",
    "the gaussian - like patterns of @xmath0 in ba model express _ random _ character of clustering relationships .",
    "in fact , it is known that the distribution of distances between randomly chosen sites in ba network is gaussian .",
    "it follows that interrelations in the nearest neighbourhood of any vertex in ba model are similar to interrelations between randomly chosen vertices in the ba network .",
    "distinctly , there are no mechanisms responsible for clustering in barabsi - albert algorithm .",
    "the above - described observation can be verified by a functional dependence of centers @xmath31 of the distribution @xmath0 on the network size @xmath26 .",
    "we realised that the value @xmath31 ( fig.[fig3 ] ) expresses both : the order @xmath2 when @xmath0 obtains maximum and the average shortest path length @xmath32 between vertices belonging to the neighbourhood of any vertex within a network .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows that in ba networks the average shortest path @xmath32 scales with the system size @xmath26 in the same way as the average shortest path length for the whole network @xmath33 @xcite , i.e. in the first approximation as : @xmath34 we found that the mean distance between two nearest neighbours of the same node @xmath32 equals to the mean distance between any two nodes in the network @xmath33 minus a constant @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath35 is approximately independent on the network size @xmath26 and equals @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath29 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "in summary , we quantified the structural properties of ba networks by the higher order clustering coefficients @xmath0 defined as probabilities that the shortest distance between any two nearest neighbours of a certain vertex @xmath1 equals @xmath2 , when neglecting all paths crossing the node @xmath1 .",
    "we estimated that the average shortest path length in the node s neighbourhood is smaller than the equivalent whole network quantity and the remainder depends only on the network parameter @xmath3 .",
    "our results show in a vivid way that the absence of the clustering phenomenon in ba networks is due to the random character of the nearest neighbourhood in these networks .",
    "recently some alternative algorithms have been suggested to account for the high clustering found in real weblike systems .",
    "holm and kim @xcite have extended the standard ba model adding the trial formation rule .",
    "networks built according to their guidelines exhibit both the high clustering and the scale - free nature .",
    "barabasi et al .",
    "@xcite and independently dorogovtsev et al .",
    "@xcite have found that scale - free random networks can be modelled in a deterministic manner by so - called pseudofractal scale - free networks .",
    "they argued that the high clustering in real networks might result from their hierarchical topology .",
    "it would be interesting to analyse the higher order clustering coefficients in these networks and compare it with real data @xcite .",
