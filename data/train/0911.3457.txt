    "<S> the non - equilibrium dynamics of spin impurity atoms in a strongly interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gas under the gravity field is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we show that due to the non - equilibrium preparation of the initial state as well as the interaction between the impurity atoms and other bosons , a counterintuitive phenomenon may emerge : the impurity atoms could propagate upwards automatically in the gravity field . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the strength of interaction , the gradient of the gravity field , as well as the different configurations of the initial state are investigated by studying the time - dependent evolution of the 1d strongly interacting bosonic system using time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) method . </S>",
    "<S> a profound connection between this counterintuitive phenomenon and the repulsive bound pair is also revealed .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , ultracold atoms in optical lattice have provided a perfect platform for simulating quantum many - body models in condensed matter physics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what s more , the uniqueness of cold atomic system , such as the low dissipation rate as well as long coherence times , has opened exciting possibilities for studying non - equilibrium quantum dynamics of many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that , due to the energy dissipation between the system and the environment , the properties of the many - body system in solid state physics is mainly determined by its ground state as well as its low - energy excited state . in the ultracold atomic systems , however , the extreme low dissipation rates there guarantees the conservation of the system energy and total particle number in a relatively long time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , not only the ground state but also the high energy excited state may contribute to the non - equilibrium dynamics of the many - body systems , which may exhibit novel phenomena @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> repulsively bound atom pairs is one of the most interesting and novel phenomena emerging from the non - equilibrium many - body physics in optical lattice@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that though repulsive force separates particles in free space , under a periodic potential and in the absence of dissipation , a bound atom pairs could be stabilized by the strongly repulsive interaction due to the conservation of energy . </S>",
    "<S> this unconventional phenomenon provides a typical example of non - equilibrium physics determined by the high - energy excited state of the hamiltonian rather than the ground state , and has no analogue in traditional condensed matter systems due to the rapid dissipation . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we provide another example of these exotic non - equilibrium phenomena by studying the propagation of spin impurity atoms through a strongly interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gas under an external potential which decreases linearly along a particular direction . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state and the quench dynamics of the bose - hubbard model under linear external potential have been discussed previously@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the initial state is prepared far away from the equilibrium ground state , the spin impurity atoms could propagate towards the direction the external linear potential increases , which means a particle with initial momentum zero moves upwards in a gravity field in our case . </S>",
    "<S> this unconventional phenomenon , similar to the repulsive bound atom pairs , is a result of the conservation of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> we would also discuss the profound connection between these two non - equilibrium phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we propose the experimental set - up of our non - equilibrium system . </S>",
    "<S> it is motivated by a recent experiment@xcite , where the quantum transport of spin impurity atoms through a tonks - giradeau gas is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the departure point of our experimental set - up is loading the @xmath0 atoms with the hyperfine ground state @xmath1 into a 1d optical lattice , which is along z - direction . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the interaction between these @xmath0 atoms is very large and the filling factor is one , thus the ground state of the system is the mott state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an additional harmonic magnetic trap is implemented to provide a vertical confinement for the atoms and prevent the atoms escaping from the optical lattice due to the gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic magnetic trap couples with the atoms via the magnetic dipole interaction , therefore the vertical confinement is purely magnetic .     to @xmath2 level . </S>",

    "<S> below we denote the @xmath7 as trap atoms and @xmath5 as impurity atom . the spatial width and position of the pulse </S>",
    "<S> could be controlled experimentally@xcite . in our case , we constraint the pulse to only induce the transition on one site and produces one impurity , as shown in fig.1 ( general case containing more than one impurities will be discussed below ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice the magnetic moment of the impurity atom @xmath5 is zero thus it is not confined by the harmonic magnetic trap and experiences an external linear potential produced by gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental set - up proposed here is different from that in ref.@xcite in the way that in our case , the bosons are loaded in a 1d optical lattice along the z - direction , rather than the tonks - girardeau gas loading in a continuous 1d space . without the constraint of the periodic potential along the z - direction , an impurity atom in a gravity field </S>",
    "<S> would be accelerated downwards and finally escape from the system , as shown in ref.@xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , however , the dynamics of the impurity atom becomes complex and nontrivial due to the optical lattice structure as well as the interaction between the impurity atom and the trap atoms . without the interaction , the single particle dynamics </S>",

    "<S> @xmath13 is the interspecies on - site interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the intraspecies on - site interaction @xmath14 and @xmath15 are repulsive much larger than @xmath16 , thus the boson could be considered as hard - core for the bosons with same species . </S>",

    "<S> we assume that the energy scale of the gap between the s - band and p - band is much larger than that of the parameters @xmath23 in our hamiltonian.(1 ) , therefore all the atoms are confined within the s - band and no interband physics involved . as we analyzed above , </S>",
    "<S> only the impurity atoms experience the gravity potential while the trap atoms are still confined by the magnetic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium initial state can be represented as : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) denotes the trap ( impurity ) atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity atom is initially localized in the center of the optical lattice , while all the trap atoms are still in the mott phase . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this initial state is not a eigenstate of the hamiltonian.(1 ) thus it would evolve . the time evolution of the system </S>",
    "<S> is controlled by the parameters in hamiltonian.(1 ) . below we would study the dynamics of the impurity atom and show how it depends on the parameters ( @xmath27 ) in hamiltonian.(1 ) using the tebd method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> total number conservation is used to reduce the computational effort . a straightforward treatment of the two component hcb needs local dimension @xmath28 , to reduce the computational effort , unfold technique is used and thus the local dimension is reduced to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the pay off is that the chain length increases to @xmath30 and next - nearest neighbor interactions are introduced . </S>",
    "<S> swap technique @xcite is used to deal with next - nearest neighbor interaction within tebd method . </S>",
    "<S> both the unfolded ( @xmath29 ) and folded ( @xmath28 ) algorithm are implemented and to cross check the results . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we deal with chain length @xmath31 , and the spin impurity was create at the @xmath32 site . </S>",
    "<S> finite size effect has little effect to the conclusion since the bloch oscillation physics confines the atom near its original position . </S>",
    "<S> in the course of real time evolution we take the truncation dimension @xmath33 and time step @xmath34 , the convergence is checked by taking larger @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of density distribution of the impurity atom is shown in fig.1,(b)-(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the motion of impurity atom s center of mass ( com ) on the interaction ( u ) and potential gradient ( g ) is shown in fig.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if there is no interaction ( u=0 ) , the com of the impurity atom does not move at all . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon could be understood from the dynamics of a single particle under a combination of periodic and a linear external potential . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the external potential breaks the translational symmetry , render momentum @xmath36 not a good quantum number . </S>",
    "<S> however , by choosing the temporal gauge ( the scalar potential @xmath37 ) , the external potential is taken into account by a time - dependent gauge field @xmath38 and the momentum @xmath36 is replaced by @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the noninteracting hamiltonian can be rewritten in the momentum space as : @xmath40 , where @xmath39 is good quantum number . </S>",
    "<S> suppose initially the particle locates on the point @xmath41 , the initial state can be represented in the momentum space as : @xmath42 ( @xmath43=1 because @xmath41 ) , where @xmath44 is the single particle eigenstate in the momentum space and the sum is over the first brillouin zone . in the process of time evolution , </S>",
    "<S> all the @xmath44 modes experience bloch oscillation from different initial momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the localization of the com is actually a consequence of the superposition of all the momentum modes @xmath44 in our initial state , the bloch oscillation in @xmath44 and @xmath45 modes cancel with each other and the net effect is zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the single particle picture does not work when @xmath46 , thus we deal with the time evolution by tebd . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath47 , the com of the impurity atom would move downwards until it reaches a steady quasi - equilibrium position , while interesting phenomenon emerges for @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the com of the impurity atom would move upwards though it is experiencing a gravity potential . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the dependence of the motion of com on @xmath21 is not monotone . </S>",
    "<S> notice in both case of large u and small u , the com is always constrained around the original position . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum deviation of the com away from original point occurs when @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the dynamic of the com on the gravity gradient g is also nontrivial . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that for larger g , the com of the impurity would drop to a higher a final quasi - equilibrium position . </S>",
    "<S> the period of the oscillation is approximately the bloch period @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand the origin of the counter - intuitive phenomenon , we perform a jordan - wigner transformation to map our system into a interacting fermionic system ( considering the hard - core nature for the intraspecies boson ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we use the particle - hole transformation on the trap atoms , thus the problem could be translated into a two - particle problem due to the half - filling condition in our initial state . the initial configuration in fig.[fig : lattice](a ) could be considered as two particles ( an impurity atom and a trap hole ) located on the same site ( doublon ) of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> below we mainly focus on the attractive condition ( @xmath48 ) in original model , which could be mapped into a two - particle problem with replusive interaction ( @xmath51 ) under the particle - hole transformation . if @xmath52 , the dynamics of this two - particle problem reminds us of the physics in the the repulsively bound atom pairs@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is a doublon state with a high energy @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> if the two particles are separated , the loss of the interaction energy ( @xmath53 ) should be compensated by the increasing of the kinetic energy of the single particle to preserve the total energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the periodic lattice structure , the kinetic energy of a single particle has a maximal value ( @xmath54 ) . therefore , when @xmath52 , a doublon would be stabilized by the strong repulsive interaction , </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : phasediag](c ) . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , interesting thing happens for smaller u , where the gravity field play a key role . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the loss of the interaction energy could be compensated by the increasing of the gravity potential energy of the impurity atom to preserve the total energy , as shown in fig.[fig : phasediag](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy transfer between the interaction energy and gravity potential energy results in the anomalous dynamics of the impurity atom .    </S>",
    "<S> [ tbp ]   and different interacting strength , @xmath8 values are indicated at right axis.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=264 ]    to verify this qualitative picture , we again use tebd to study the two particle dynamics from the given initial doublon state . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig.[fig : var_dbocc ] , we introduce the variance of the com of the impurity atom , defined as @xmath55 , to characterize the width of the wave packet , and the total doubly occupancy number @xmath56 to study the fate of the initial doublon state , where @xmath57 denotes the number of the trap hole on site @xmath58 . the variance decrease as the increase of the interacting strength , although it shows oscillation which is given by the bloch oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> this means that larger interacting strength squeeze the wave packet harder since dispersion of it lose more energy . for very large @xmath53 ( compared to @xmath19 and @xmath22 ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath59 is approaching to @xmath60 and @xmath61 to @xmath62 , which means the doublon state is stabilized by the strong repulsive interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the doublon is localized on its original position since motion of it towards any direction violate the energy conservation in the gravity field . for smaller @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> , interacting energy could be released to the energy continuum by pumping the impurity atom upwards to gain potential energy . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is further confirmed by the rapid decreasing of the total double occupancy number , which means the doublon dissolve shortly for small interacting strength . </S>",
    "<S> the com and its variance of the impurity atom could be measured by time resolved tomographic measurement of the impurity density distribution @xcite .    . </S>",
    "<S> , width=321 ]    translate back into spin impurity language , the impurity atom and a trap hole bind together to form an exciton ( which is the doublon in the two - particle picture ) for both large attractive and repulsive interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for the noninteracting case , the exciton dissolves immediately and bloch oscillation physics dominates . for the intermediate interacting strength , the impurity atom will move upwards or downwards depending on the sign of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the sketch phase diagram is shown in fig.[fig : phasediag ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice that there is crossover instead of phase transition between different regions . </S>",
    "<S> the general principle guiding the time evolution of the strongly interacting systems is that the system always evolves toward a maximum entropy state with the constraint of the conservation of good quantum numbers ( such as energy and total particle number)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so the competition between the energy and entropy play a key role in determining the properties in the final quasi - equilibrium steady state .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would discuss the dynamic of the impurity atom evolving from two different initial configurations , we focus on the attractive condition to show the dependence of the anomalous phenomenon on the initial configuration we choose . </S>",
    "<S> the first case is that the filling factor in the initial state is not one , which means the impurity would propagate in an environment of the quasi - superfluid of the trap atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive interaction between the impurity and the bec atoms leads to a polaron@xcite , and its transport properties have been studied previously@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the initial state as a quasi - superfluid with 31 hard - core bosons filled in the 1d lattice with 33 sites . </S>",
    "<S> we can find that the com of the impurity atom does not move upwards , different from that in the mott initial state . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon can also be understood by the particle - hole transformation on the trap atoms . in this case , the trap hole is not localized in the initial configuration due to the quasi - superfluidity of the trap atoms , which means there is no high - energy doublon initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the energy transfer picture is no longer available , thus the anomalous transport phenomenon disappears . </S>",
    "<S> actually , we can always prepare a mott plateau region in lattice by adding an external harmonic trap potential , even the filling factor is not one , and the `` negative mass '' phenomena will still appear . the other configuration is to apply a pulse of radio frequency on more than one site and produce many impurity atoms in the initial configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is chosen as five impurity atoms ( from site 15 to site 19 ) located in the middle of the lattice while all other site is filled with trap atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we can find in this case the com can still move upwards in the attractive interaction and the main result of this paper is not qualitatively changed by this multi - impurity effect . </S>"
