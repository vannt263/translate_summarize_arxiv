    "it is not surprising that various fcnc processes are extensively studied in many of the extended models beyond the sm .",
    "suppressed strongly in the sm as a second order weak process with strong gim cancellations , the rare decay @xmath3@xcite need to be considered as an important process which provides possible virtual signals of new physics .",

    ", we investigate @xmath3 in a vector quark model ( vqm)@xcite . with the inclusion of exotic heavy quarks with different quantum numbers under the sm gauge groups , it could be possible that the ckm matrix elements in the vqm are different and that the gim cancellations in the first three generations are violated by these extra heavy quarks . demanding",
    "all existed phenomenological constrains satisfied , we find that the branch ration of @xmath3 in a vqm could amount to @xmath1 , several orders larger than its sm prediction which is below @xmath6@xcite .",
    "the vqms are the sm extensions by adding into exotic quarks with non - standard @xmath7 assignments .",
    "the models could naturally emerge from some extensions of sm such as @xmath8 grand unified theory .",
    "although these exotic quarks are heavy , they do not necessarily decouple in the low energy phenomenology . at low energy",
