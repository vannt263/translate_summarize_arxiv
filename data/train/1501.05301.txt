    "the large area telescope ( lat , * ? ? ? * ) on _ fermi _ has recently allowed a broadband , accurate , measurement of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( egb ) , the integrated emission of _ all _ resolved and unresolved extragalactic gev sources , characterizing its intensity over almost 4 decades in energy between 0.1gev and 820gev ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ac14 ) .",
    "at these energies , the egb spectrum is found compatible with a power law with a photon index of 2.32(@xmath4 ) that is exponentially cut off at 279(@xmath552)gev ( ac14 ) .",
    "such cut - off , observed for the first time , may be caused by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , this observation alone is not sufficient to identify which process or source population is responsible for the egb .",
    "specifically , the egb may encompass the signatures of processes generating a truly diffuse background , like intergalactic shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath0-ray emission induced by ultra - high energy cosmic rays in intergalactic space ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dark matter ( dm ) annihilation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "besides truly diffuse processes @xcite , unresolved point - like sources might be responsible for a substantial part of the egb @xcite . at high galactic latitudes , _",
    "fermi_-lat has detected blazars , star - forming galaxies , radio galaxies and millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "extensive analyses were recently performed to assess the contribution of all these source classes to the egb .",
    "blazars , which constitute the largest population detected by the lat , were found to contribute @xmath32030% of the unresolved egb @xcite , and a larger fraction in some models @xcite .",
    "star - forming galaxies produce @xmath0-rays in cosmic - ray interactions , with the acceleration of cosmic rays ultimately powered by star formation @xcite .",
    "being dimmer but more numerous than blazars , star - forming galaxies might be responsible for 1030% of the 0.1100gev egb photons @xcite .",
    "a similar argument holds for misaligned agn ( e.g. radio galaxies ) , which were recently found to produce @xmath320% of the egb @xcite .",
    "however , large uncertainties remain for the contributions of the above source classes . in this paper",
    "we present ( in @xmath6  [ sec : analysis ] ) improved modeling of the evolution and of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars , which allows us to quantify their integrated emission .",
    "we show ( in @xmath6  [ sec : discussion ] ) that the integrated emission of blazars , star - forming and radio galaxies naturally accounts for the amplitude and spectrum of the new egb measurement over the entire 0.1820gev energy range .",
    "we then use this information to place constraints on the dm annihilation cross section . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt h@xmath7=67 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9=1-@xmath10=0.30 .",
    "the contribution of blazars to the egb was already estimated in @xcite by extrapolating the @xmath11-@xmath12 below the _ fermi_-lat detection threshold .",
    "taking advantage of recent follow up observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we derive new models for the luminosity and redshift evolution of the whole blazar class and of its sed . in this section , these models are constrained using blazar data ( fluxes , redshifts and photon indices ) from @xcite , the @xmath210gev @xmath11-@xmath12 from @xcite and information on the spectral curvature of blazars @xcite to robustly estimate the integrated emission of blazars .",
    "we rely on the sample of 403 blazars detected with test statistic @xmath250 at @xmath1315@xmath14 in @xcite , for which a determination of the lat detection efficiency exists @xcite .",
    "this sample includes 211 bl lacs , 186 flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and 6 blazars of uncertain type .",
    "all but 109 bl lacs have a spectroscopic redshift and @xcite provide redshift constraints for 104 ( out of the 109 ) bl lacs .",
    "the fraction of sources with redshift information is @xmath399% while the incompleteness of the sample , due to unassociated sources that might be blazars , is @xmath310% .",
    "we do not separate the two blazar sub - classes ( fsrqs , and bl lacs ) because the larger sample allows a better determination of the integrated emission from the whole population , and averages over the luminosity functions of the two populations in the regime of overlapping luminosities . in order to derive the luminosity function ( lf )",
    ", we use the bootstrap monte carlo approach developed in @xcite that allows us to treat properly those sources with an imprecise redshift , providing a robust error estimate .",
    "we test models of primarily luminosity evolution ( ple ) , primarily density evolution ( pde ) and luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) . in all these models the sources experience both luminosity and density evolution .",
    "the lf at redshift @xmath15 , for sources of 0.1 - 100gev rest - frame luminosity @xmath16 ( in erg s@xmath8 ) , is modeled as a double power law multiplied by the photon index distribution : @xmath17^{-1}\\cdot   e^{-0.5[\\gamma-\\mu(l_{\\gamma})]^2/\\sigma^2 }   \\label{eq : lf0}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the gaussian mean and dispersion of the photon index ( @xmath20 distribution .",
