    "recently , mcclure et al.@xcite and zhang et al.@xcite performed measurements of current noise auto- and cross - correlation in a system of two capacitively coupled quantum dots ( 2qd ) .",
    "it is first measurement showing some aspects of current correlations in 2qd , as anti - bunching and bunching of scattered electrons .",
    "the 2qd system is simplest , in which one can see a role of coulombic interactions on current - current correlations .    in a system of noninteracting electrons",
    "the pauli principle is essential in scattering process and it can lead to anti - bunching.@xcite this effect in a multiterminal geometry , such as in the hanbury brown and twiss experiment,@xcite can be manifested in negative cross - correlation between scattered electrons .",
    "the phenomena was studied theoretically@xcite and observed in several experiments.@xcite in nanostructures anti - bunching is responsible for reduction of auto - correlation shot noise @xmath0 below the poissonian value @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the average current and @xmath3 is the charge of an electron.@xcite for sequential tunneling through a single quantum dot ( qd ) a maximal reduction of the shot noise can be to the value @xmath4.@xcite    an enhancement of shot noise above the poissonian value was observed in a resonant tunneling diode by iannaccone et al.@xcite and in a quantum well by kuznetsov et al.@xcite in the region of negative differential resistance .",
    "the enhancement of shot noise was interpreted as a result of change in the density of states , which causes more state to be available for tunneling from cathode . strong back - scattering , at current pinch - off ( close to the coulomb blockade border ) , can be also responsible for an enhancement of shot noise.@xcite in the coulomb blockade region inelastic cotunneling processes can affect transport and lead to super - poissonian shot noise.@xcite    recently , wu and yip,@xcite and rychkov and bttiker@xcite applied a phenomenological langevin formalism in circuit modeling to calculations of current cross - correlations in a 3-terminal system .",
    "an interesting result is that current cross - correlations are always positive in a macroscopic classical 3-terminal with a fluctuating current in an input electrode .",
    "it is in contrast to a microscopic picture of scattered electrons , which in general shows anti - bunching with negative cross - correlations.@xcite however , there is an exception when inelastic scattering occurs .",
    "texier and bttiker@xcite considered a multiterminal system with inelastic scattering in an additional electrode , in which the current was kept equal to zero and which caused voltage fluctuations .",
    "they showed that inelastic scattering can lead to positive cross - correlations , whereas for quasielastic scattering correlations remain always negative .",
    "just recently oberholzer at al.@xcite confirmed experimentally these predictions in a device with fractional quantum hall effect edge states , in which interactions between current carrying states and a fluctuating voltage were controlled by an external gate voltage .",
    "if scattered electrons are entangled , the situation can be different , one can see bunching or anti - bunching .",
    "burkard et al.@xcite showed that for singlets the auto - correlation function is twice as large as for independent electrons and is reduced to zero for triplets .",
    "current correlations in the system of two capacitively coupled quantum dots were studied theoretically in several papers.@xcite our studies on a ferromagnetic single electron transistor ( fset)@xcite are closely related , because there are two channels for electrons with opposite spins @xmath5 , @xmath6 and coulomb interactions are included as well .",
    "for the first time we pointed on dynamical coulomb blockade effect between the both channels , which is responsible for a reduction of current and leads to the super - poissonian shot noise .",
    "positive cross - correlations were predicted by cottet et al.@xcite on a similar system with three terminals and 3qds .",
    "they also analyzed time evolution of tunneling events and presented bunching .",
    "dynamical coulomb blockade and bunching were studied by gustavsson et al.@xcite in time - resolved measurements of electron transport through a multilevel qd .    in this paper",
    "we want to study a microscopic nature of dynamical current correlations , especially a role of coulomb interactions , in the 2qd system .",
    "some problems were mentioned earlier,@xcite for example , a role of charge and polarization fluctuations and their contribution to the current correlation function .",
    "we expect that for a symmetric case these contributions may compensate each other , but they can be pronounced in an asymmetric case .",
    "two different situations will be studied , with a weak and strong inter - dot coupling .",
    "we will show that both the cases have different charging diagrams in the space of biases applied to the both channels . for the strong coupling electron transfer in one of the channel",
    "should be strongly correlated with charge drag in the second channel . in order to see correlations between individual tunneling events",
    "we decompose correlation functions and analyze contributions leading to the sub-/super - poissonian noise as well to positive cross - correlations .",
    "the experiments@xcite were performed for small biases and near degeneracy lines separating different coulomb blockade regions .",
    "the present studies are more general .",
    "we analyze the schottky contribution , which can be large close to the coulomb blockade border due to backward scattering .",
    "however , our main interest focus on dynamical correlations for electronic transport outside the coulomb blockade region when the bias window is large .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "ii we describe the 2qd model , derive general formulas for charging energy , current and correlation functions .",
    "the section iii presents charging diagrams and allowed tunneling processes in the space of bias voltages .",
    "the charging diagrams are background for further analysis of correlations between individual tunneling events presented in the section iv .",
    "we show there differences of auto- and cross - correlations for weak and strong inter - dot coupling .",
    "the correlation functions are non - monotonous with bias voltages , which means that there are several competing correlation processes .",
    "our decomposition approach shows which contributions are relevant .",
    "for example , current cross - correlations are in general negative ( except special situations with asymmetric resistances ) , but this anti - bunching effect is due to potential fluctuations ( it is not due to the pauli exclusion principle as in many nanostructures@xcite ) .",
    "main results of the paper are summarized in the final section v.",
    "we consider a system which consists of two large capacitively coupled quantum dots ( top and bottom : @xmath7 ) with a continuous electronic density of states .",
    "each quantum dot ( qd ) is connected with the left ( @xmath8 ) and the right ( @xmath9 ) electrodes through the tunnel junctions which are characterized by the tunnel resistances @xmath10 and capacitances @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the strength of the inter - dot coulomb interaction is modeled by the capacitance @xmath12 . to this 4-terminal system ,",
    "the bias voltages @xmath13 , @xmath14 are applied to the right electrodes , while both the left electrodes are grounded ( asymmetric bias ) . usually additional gates are applied to the qds , which can change their electrochemical potentials and number of electrons . in order to simplify the analysis these gates can be omitted .",
    "the corresponding resistances of the tunnel junctions are assumed to be much larger than quantum resistance @xmath15 so the electronic transport is dominated by incoherent , sequential tunneling processes.@xcite since our research is focused on dynamical processes in high voltage regime ( outside the coulomb blockade ) , higher order processes ( e.g. , cotunneling ) are neglected .",
    "cotunneling can be relevant in the coulomb blockade region , for tunneling currents as well as super - poissonian shot noise.@xcite it is also assumed that the temperature @xmath16 is low which means that charging energies of the individual dots @xmath17 and an energy of the inter - dot coulomb interaction @xmath18 are much larger than a thermal energy @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "the voltage drops on the tunnel junctions as well as between both dots ( i.e. , on the capacitance @xmath12 ) can be calculated from kirchhoff s laws : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where an electron charge @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is a number of electrons transferred from the right electrode to the top ( bottom ) qd and charges on the capacitors @xmath11 are @xmath42 ( @xmath7 ; @xmath43 ) .",

    "[ fig6](d ) .",
    "there occurs a pumping effect : charge transfer in the top qd leads to injection ( or ejection ) of charge in the bottom part of the device .",

    "our studies resemble shot noise in the presence of coulomb drag in coupled quantum wires.@xcite in both the systems local charge and voltage fluctuations make electronic transport strongly correlated,@xcite which is seen in the current - current correlation functions .",
    "of course our system is different , because we have assumed incoherent transport with electron thermalization at each quantum dot and electron transfer between the dots is prohibited , thus a momentum transfer and exchange processes are absent in our system  in contrast to coupled quantum wires , where these processes are relevant for the coulomb drag effect .",
    "we showed also that the current cross - correlation function @xmath156 is in general negative , indicating on anti - bunching between charges transferred through the both channels .",
    "let us stress again that here anti - bunching is a dynamical process caused by coulombic repulsion between transferred electrons ( strong potential anti - correlations on the both qds ) , but it is not fermionic origin ( as in recent studies for electrons scattered in nanostructures@xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath156 can have a plateau or can be non - monotonic as a function of bias voltage .",
    "the analysis of its components @xmath182 showed that there are negative and positive contributions corresponding to forward and backward tunneling processes .",
    "moreover , it was seen that due to retarded and advanced processes individual components @xmath223 at some finite bias voltages .",
    "all these various contributions give @xmath156 as a non - monotonic function , which can change its sign in some situations with asymmetric tunneling resistances .",
    "mcclure et al.@xcite performed an experiment on a 2qd system , which showed sign reversal of the current cross - correlation function @xmath224 near a honeycomb vertex in the charge stability space . applying gate voltages to the top and the bottom qd they could go from one stability region to another .",
    "since the sign of @xmath224 depends on directions of tunneling processes ( whether electrons are injected to or ejected from qds ) , sign reversal of @xmath224 was observed at a state degeneracy line between the stability regions .",
    "the effect was also seen when one bias voltage was reversed . notice that the experiment was performed close to border lines separating different coulomb blockade regions and bias voltages were small .",

    ". it would be interesting to extend the experimental setup@xcite outside the coulomb blockade regime and verify our theoretical predictions , for example , to see competition of various contributions to the cross - correlation function @xmath156 .",
