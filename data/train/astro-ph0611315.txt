    "we have simulated three - dimensional ( 3d ) , turbulent , thermally - relaxed , nearly adiabatic convection ( high pclet number ) .",
    "such flow is relevant to deep convective regions in stars ( i.e. , to most stellar mass which is convective , but not mildly sub - photospheric and surface regions ) .",
    "we simulate oxygen shell burning on its natural time scale , and core hydrogen burning driven at 10 times its natural rate .",
    "the simulations develop a robust quasi - steady behavior in a statistical sense , with significant intermittency .",
    "we analyze this statistical behavior quantitatively , and compare it to predictions of astrophysical mixing length theory @xcite . mixing - length theory ( mlt )",
    "gives a good representation of many aspects of convection , but omits others ( especially wave generation and mass entrainment ) which are related to the dynamical behavior of stably stratified layers adjacent to the convection .    in section  2",
    "we briefly summarize some results of the study of turbulent entrainment in geophysics , to prepare the reader for its appearance in our astrophysical simulations .",
    "this process is not included in the standard approach to stellar evolution @xcite . in section  3",
    "we discuss our numerical and theoretical tools . in section  4",
    "we present our simulations of oxygen shell burning , which attain a thermal steady state ( this is possible because of the rapidity of nuclear heating and neutrino cooling ) . in section  5",
    "we discuss a less advanced burning stage , core hydrogen burning , which we are able to examine with the use of an artificially enhanced hydrogen burning rate ( by a factor of ten ) .",
    "we find that the behavior is similar to the oxygen burning shell , suggesting that our results may have broad application for stellar evolution . in section  6",
    "we compare our results to the assumptions of mlt , and in section  7 we show that our results lead to a simple model of turbulent entrainment , an effect not in mlt nor in standard stellar evolutionary calculations .",
    "this paper is the first in a series . in subsequent papers ,",
    "we incorporate the `` empirical '' convection model developed in this paper into the tycho stellar evolution code @xcite and begin to assess its influence on stellar evolution , on nucleosynthetic yields , and on the structure of supernova progenitors .",
    "the presence of a turbulent layer contiguous with a stably stratified layer is common in both astrophysical and geophysical flows .",
    "turbulence in a stratified media is often sustained by strong shear flows or thermal convection and bound by a stabilizing density interface . over time , the turbulent layer `` diffuses '' into the stable layer and the density interface recedes , thus increasing the size of the mixed , turbulent region .",
    "the basic features of this _ turbulent entrainment problem _ are illustrated in figure [ diagram ] .",
    "the rate at which the density interface recedes into the stable layer @xmath7 is called the entrainment rate , and its dependance on the parameters characterizing the turbulent and the stable layers has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "it is generally ignored in stellar evolutionary studies .",
    "experimental studies have mostly been of `` mixing box '' type which involves a tank of fluid with a turbulent layer and a density stratified layer .",
    "the turbulence is generated by thermal convection or an oscillating wire mesh , and density stratification imposed by either a solute or thermal gradient @xcite .",
    "complementary to these shear - free mixing box models are shear driven - models .",
    "shear - driven turbulence experiments involve either a recirculation track which propels one layer of fluid above a stationary layer , or a rotating plate in contact with the fluid that drives a circulation in the upper layer .",
    "shear instabilities sustain a turbulent mixed layer in the overlying fluid which then entrains fluid from the lower , stationary layer @xcite . in all of these laboratory experiments , a variety of flow visualization techniques",
    "are used to study both the overall entrainment rate @xmath8 and the physical mechanisms which underly the entrainment process .",
    "one of the primary conclusions of these studies is that the entrainment rate depends on a richardson number , which is a dimensionless measure of the `` stiffness '' of the boundary relative to the strength of the turbulence . in shear - free turbulent entrainment the bulk richardson number ,    @xmath9    is most commonly studied .",
    "here , @xmath10 is the buoyancy jump across the interface , @xmath11 is the r.m.s .",
    "turbulence velocity adjacent the interface , and @xmath12 is a length scale for the turbulent motions often taken to be the horizontal integral scale of the turbulence at the interface .",
    "the relative buoyancy is defined by the integral ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the buoyancy frequency defined by ,    @xmath15    the entrainment coefficient @xmath16 is the interface migration speed @xmath17 normalized by the r.m.s .",
    "turblent velocity at the interface @xmath18 , and is generally found to obey a power law dependance on @xmath19 ,    @xmath20    the exponent is usually found to lie in the range @xmath21 and has been the subject of many theoretical studies of the entrainment process .",
    "dimensional analysis suggests that @xmath19 should be the controlling parameter , so long as microscopic diffusion plays a minor role @xcite .",
    "basic energetic arguments in which the rate of change of potential energy due to mixing is assumed to be proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy available at the interface leads to an exponent of @xmath22 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this same power law exponent has also been derived for models of the growth of the planetary boundary layer due to turbulent entrainment by penetrative convection @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the entrainment coefficient @xmath23 has been found to vary significantly between the various laboratory and field studies conducted , with recent values found in the range @xmath24 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the discrepancy among the normalization constants has been called the a - dilema @xcite . a review ( up to 1991 ) of experimental measures of the parameters in the entrainment law of equation [ entrainment - law - equation ] are tabulated in @xcite and a recent review of entrainment models used in the atmospheric sciences is discussed by @xcite .",
    "the experimental and theoretical models discussed above are generally motivated by geophysical problems , but are directly relevant to the conditions found in stellar interiors .",
    "the bulk richardson numbers which characterize stellar convective boundaries fall within the same parameter range ( @xmath25 ) , and the background stratifications posses a similar buoyancy structure , so that it is interesting to learn from the geophysical models and compare to the stellar case .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations which we study in this paper are of two distinct phases in the evolution of a 23  supernova progenitor : main sequence core convection , and convective oxygen shell burning .",
    "the initial conditions for the multi - dimensional simulations are taken from one - dimensional stellar models evolved with the tycho stellar evolution code .",
    "tycho @xcite is an an open source code .",
    "a choice of standard 1d stellar evolution procedures are used . the mixing length theory as described in @xcite is used with instantaneous mixing of composition in the convectively unstable regions .",

    "although more recent abundance determinations have been made @xcite the impact on the stellar structure of the models presented here is small , and minor variations in the abundances have a negligible influence on the development of the hydrodynamic flow .",

    "self gravity is implemented assuming the interior mass at each radius is distributed with spherical symmetry .",
    "the mass interior to the inner boundary of the hydrodynamics grid is adopted from the tycho stellar model .",
    "the stellar models , which are calculated on a finely meshed lagrangian grid , are linearly interpolated onto the eulerian hydrodynamics grid taking into account the sub - grid representation of mass used in the ppm scheme .",
    "mapping the models leads to small discrepancies in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "an equilibration to hydrostatic balance occurs through the excitation and then damping of low amplitude , standing , predominantly radial pressure waves within the computational domain .",
    "these low amplitude waves , which are well described by the linearized wave equation , have a negligible affect on the convective flow .    to save computational resources , we simulate carefully chosen subregions of the star . thus , these calculations are local models of convection in the _ box in a star _ tradition .",
    "the advantage of local convection models is that higher effective resolution can be used than is currently possible in global circulation models .",
    "this approach , however , precludes investigation of the lowest order modes of flow , and we do not yet include rotation or magnetic fields which are best studied using global domains .",
    "the boundary conditions used are periodic in angular directions , and stress - free reflecting in the radial direction .",
    "our simulation code , dubbed prompi , has been adapted to parallel computing platforms using domain decomposition and the sharing of a three zone layer of boundary values and uses the mpi message passing library to manage interprocess communication .",
    "we have evolved a 23  stellar model with the tycho code to a point where oxygen is burning in a shell which overlies a silicon - sulfur rich core .",
    "approximately 60% of the oxygen fuel available for fusion has been depleted at the time we begin the hydrodynamic simulation , when the star is @xmath42 yrs from the zero age main sequence .",
    "carbon , helium , and hydrogen burning shells are also present contemporaneously at larger radii in the classic `` onion skin '' structure @xcite . in one of the models presented here ( ob.2d.e ) , which is also discussed in @xcite , we adopt an outer radius that encompasses both the oxygen and carbon burning shells . in this paper , however , we focus our analysis on the oxygen shell burning convection zone and the stable layers which bound it .    the oxygen shell burning model affords us the opportunity to study a thermally relaxed model because the thermal balance is determined by the very large neutrino cooling rates rather than the much lower radiative diffusion timescale ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.11 ) .",
    "neutrinos dominate the energy balance in the stable layers so that the stellar structure and the nature of convection are determined by the interplay between nuclear burning and neutrino emission @xcite .",

    "the radial profile of the simulated region is presented in figure [ ob - profile ] .",
    "the temperature and density profiles betray the complex structure of the model , including the narrow burning shell that resides at the very base of the convection zone which is coincident with the temperature peak .",
    "the initial extent of the convection zone can be identified by the plateau in oxygen mass fraction at @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 cm ) .",
    "characteristic of shell burning regions , the entropy gradient is quite steep at the boundaries of the convection zone and gives rise to peaks in the buoyancy frequency at those locations .",
    "the initial location of the upper convective boundary is coincident with a small stable layer at @xmath45 cm , which is overwhelmed by the convective flow that develops in the simulation ( see  [ transient - section ] ) .",

    "neglecting the non - alpha chain species 23 , 31 and 31 can affect the net energy generation rate during carbon and oxygen burning by a factor of a few under the conditions studied here .",

    "nuclear evolution is time advanced using the same reaction network subroutines as the tycho code and uses implicit differencing @xcite .",

    "the initial conditions are thermodynamically consistent with the initial tycho model to better than a few percent at all radii after mapping to the hydrodynamics grid .",
    "we calculate oxygen shell burning models in two and three dimensions .",
    "our baseline model , labeled ob.2d.c , is a @xmath50 wedge embedded in the equatorial plane with radii encompassing the oxygen burning convective shell and two stable bounding layers .",
    "the effects of dimensionality on the oxygen burning convective shell are explored with a three - dimensional model ob.3d.b which has an angular extents of ( 27@xmath51)@xmath52 .",
    "the influence of the upper boundary was studied with model ob.2d.e , which includes the overlying carbon burning convective shell as well ( additional details concerning this model are presented in @xcite ) .",
    "a preliminary resolution study is undertaken with model ob.2d.c which uses the same domain limits but twice the linear resolution of the baseline model .",
    "properties of the oxygen shell burning models presented in this paper are summarized in table [ ob - table ] .",
    "convection is initiated through random low - amplitude ( 0.1% ) perturbations in density and temperature applied to a region in the center of the convectively unstable layer on a zone by zone basis .",
    "( two additional simulation models with the same characteristics as ob.2d.c were calculated which used perturbations with a larger amplitudes and ( 1% ) , and a low order mode distribution .",
    "the development of the convective flow was found to be insensitive to these differences . )",
    "the role played by the perturbations is to break the angular symmetry of the initial model , and seed rising and sinking plumes whose growth is driven by nuclear burning , neutrino cooling , and the slightly superadiabatic background gradient imprinted in the initial tycho model . as the plumes rise they penetrate the original convective boundary which was determined in the tycho code using the ledoux criterion .",
    "the initial evolution of the flow is presented in a time series of snapshots in figure [ ob - initial - transient ] ; the light yellow contour shows the initial outer convective boundary .",
    "the location of the initial outer boundary can be seen as a small bump in the initial profile of the buoyancy frequency presented in figure [ ob - profile ] at radius @xmath53 cm .",
    "the reason the boundary is stable in the 1d model but did not survive in the multi - d simulation is because of the local nature of the ledoux criterion used .",
    "this can be appreciated by the fact that although the buoyancy frequency at this location is positive , and hence locally stable to convective turnover , the _ buoyancy jump _ across this region is very small @xmath54 cm / s@xmath52 compared to the turbulent kinetic energy in the adjacent flow , by which it is easily overwhelmed .",
    "this type of inconsistency can be relatively easily removed from 1d simulations by using a parameter akin to the bulk richardson number ( eq . [",
    "[ rib - eq ] ] ) to characterize convective boundaries in place of the ledoux or schwarzchild criteria . for the original outer boundary @xmath55 , a condition under which a boundary is expected to mix on an advection timescale , akin to the expansion of turbulence into a homogenous medium .",
    "the relationship between @xmath19 and the traditional schwarzschild and ledoux criteria can be appreciated by writing the buoyancy frequency in terms of the well known `` nablas '' used in stellar evolution ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the gradient of the stellar background , @xmath59 is the gradient due to an adiabatic displacement , @xmath60 is the mean molecular weight gradient , and the thermodynamic derivatives are @xmath61 and @xmath62 . therefore , the ledoux criteria is simply ,    @xmath63    the schwarzschild criteria is the same , but with the stabilizing effect of the mean molecular weight gradient @xmath64 neglected . for comparison , the bulk richardson number can be written @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is some measure of the boundary width .",
    "a convective boundary will start to become stabilizing when ,    @xmath67    this latter criteria is based on a finite threshold for stability which takes into account the strength of the convective turbulence",
    ". additionally , the bulk richardson number is more than a simple stability criteria ; it is also an indicator of the rate at which boundary erosion will proceed .",
    "we conclude that the correct criterion for determining the extent of a convective zone is neither the ledoux nor the schwarzschild criterion , which are both static , linear , and local criteria , but a _ dynamic boundary condition _ , based on the bulk richardson number , which we will discuss in more detail in  [ entrainment - section ] .",
    "the rich dynamics taking place at the convective boundary are apparent in the time evolution of the 3d flow presented in figure [ ob3d - evol ] , which provides a global view of the evolution .",
    "the upper panel shows the evolution in time and radius of the oxygen abundance gradient , represented by a colormap in which light is large and dark is small . at the beginning of the simulation ( far left )",
    "the colors are smooth as the turbulence has not yet developed .",
    "the light line near the bottom of the panel is the lower boundary of the convective shell , where oxygen is separated from the silicon - sulfur core below .",
    "the short horizontal band at @xmath68 cm is the initial weakly stable convective boundary discussed above ; it is overwhelmed in the first 100 seconds by convection .",
    "after @xmath69300 seconds the abundance distribution has approached a quasi - steady state , with slow growth of the convective region .",
    "the bottom of the convection zone moves downward , but at a much slower rate than the upper boundary moves outward .",
    "the mottled apearance in the convection zone is due to the ingestion of new oxygen entrained from above , followed by turbulent mixing . at the top boundary of the convection zone",
    "an oscillatory behavior can be seen , and in the overlying stable region wave motions are apparent .",
    "the lower panel in figure [ ob3d - evol ] shows the radial profile of the kinetic energy , which illustrates a major feature of the convection : intermittency .",
    "while these simulations are well described by a statistical steady state over a few convective turnover times , at any instant the fluctuations are significant .",
    "the flow is episodic , with bursts of activity followed by lulls .",
    "the bursts in kinetic energy in the convection zone are seen to induce wave trains in both the upper and lower stable layers .",
    "characteristic of g - modes , the phase velocity ( orientation of the wave crests ) is orthogonal to the group velocity ( direction of energy transport ) in these wave trains , which can be seen by comparing the composition and kinetic energy profiles .      following the transient readjustment of the outer convective boundary , the oxygen burning convective shell attains a quasi - steady character . in figure [ teint - ob ]",
    "we present the time evolution of the integrated internal , gravitational , and kinetic energy .",
    "the energy is calculated by forming horizontal averages of the flow properties and then assuming a full spherical geometry .",
    "the gravitational energy contribution from material on the computational grid is calculated according to ,    @xmath70    where the mass increment is @xmath71 , and the integral is taken over the radial limits of the grid .    the total kinetic energy levels off in all of the models by @xmath72s .",
    "the 2d models are characterized by a much larger overall kinetic energy .",

    "velocity fluctuations are presented in figure [ ob-2d-3d - vrms ] for the 2d and 3d models .",
    "the velocity fluctuation amplitudes in all of the 2d models are higher than the 3d model by a factor of @xmath692 .",
    "the 2d models also assume a significantly different radial profile than the 3d model , with a flow structure that is dominated by large convective vortices which span the depth of the convection zone .",
    "the signature of these large eddies is apparent in the horizontal velocity components , as well as the fairly symmetric shape of the radial velocity profile within the convection zone .",
    "the velocity components in the 3d model reveal an up and down flowing circulation with horizontal deflection taking place in a fairly narrow layer at the convective boundaries .",
    "although significant differences exist between 2d and 3d models , the 2d models are found to be in good agreement with each other to the extent that the statistics have converged , which are calculated over the time period @xmath73$]s . the time period for calculating statistics",
    "was limited by the model ob.2d.c , which was only run as far as @xmath74s .",
    "the agreement among the 2d models shows that the outer boundary condition ( tested by model ob.2d.e ) and the grid resolution ( tested by model ob.2d.c ) are not playing a decisive role in determining the overall structure of the flow , at least in these preliminary tests .",
    "the agreement in overall velocity amplitude in the upper stable layer in model ob.2d.e indicates that the stable layer velocity amplitudes are not strongly affected by the details of the modes that are excited in that region .",
    "this gives credence to the analysis in @xcite which assumes that the stable layer velocity amplitudes are determined by the dynamical balance between the convective ram pressure and the wave induced fluctuations .",
    "the convective turnover times @xmath75 for the 2d models are all of order @xmath76s , and they span between 10 and 55 convective turnovers .",
    "the turnover time for the 3d model is @xmath77s , and the model spans approximately 8 convective turnovers .      in both the 2d and 3d models ,",
    "the stably stratified layers are characterized by velocity fluctuations throughout their extents ( figure [ ob-2d-3d - vrms ] ) .",
    "these fluctuations are the signature of g - modes which are excited by the convective motions .",
    "in the 2d model , the amplitudes of the stable layer velocity fluctuations are higher . in the lower stable layer",
    ", the 2d models also have a much smaller ratio of horizontal to radial velocity amplitude .",
    "the velocity amplitude ratio is roughly proportional to the ratio of the mode frequency and buoyancy frequency , @xmath78 @xcite , so that the waves excited in the 2d model are of lower frequency .",
    "the velocity ratios in the upper stable layer are comparable between the 2d and 3d models , though the 2d amplitudes are higher by a factor of @xmath79 .    during late burning stages , multiple concentric convective shells form which are separated by stably",
    "stratified layers .",
    "these intervening stable layers act as resonating cavities for g - modes that are excited by the turbulent convection .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the stable layer motions in model ob.2d.e can be decomposed into individual g - modes that are well described by the linearized non - radial wave equation @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a good estimate for the amplitudes of the wave motions ( and the associated thermodynamic fluctuations ) in both the 2d and 3d models can be made by assuming that the pressure fluctuations associated with the g - modes balance the ram pressure of the turbulent convection . in the latter paper , a single mode ( frequency and horizontal scale )",
    "was assumed , based on integral properties of the turbulence ( convective turnover time , and mixing length scale ) . in this section",
    "we present the spectrum of motions present in the stable layers and turbulent regions for the more realistic 3d model .    for a given background structure ,",
    "a spectrum of eigenmodes exist which are solutions to the non - radial wave equation and boundary conditions .",
    "individual modes can be uniquely identified by a horizontal wavenumber index @xmath80 and oscillation frequency @xmath81 . in figure",
    "[ ob3d - komega ] , @xmath82 diagrams are presented for the convection zone , and the two bounding stable layers .",
    "the individual @xmath82 components have been isolated through fourier transforms of a time sequence of the simulation data .",
    "several modal components or `` branches '' can be identified in the stable layer diagrams ( left and right panels ) .",
    "these include : ( 1 ) p - modes , seen as a series of points at the lowest @xmath80 values that extend to high frequencies ; ( 2 ) g - modes , which appear as ridges that are bound above by the buoyancy frequency ; and ( 3 ) f - modes , which appears as a ridge separating the g- and p - modes .",
    "the @xmath83-modes are interfacial waves , and are most prominently seen in the lower - boundary diagram at a radius @xmath84 cm .",
    "the f - mode signature is due to interfacial waves running along the convective boundary at @xmath85 cm , where there is a spike in buoyancy frequency .    in the convection zone",
    ", the spectrum is dominated by power at low temporal and spatial frequencies .",
    "this strong non - modal convection signature is also present , though at lower amplitude , in the stable layers .",
    "this `` turbulence '' spectrum can be seen extending from the lower left corner of the diagrams .",
    "this same feature was also present in the simulations of he - shell burning by @xcite .",
    "are the hydrodynamic features of oxygen shell burning of more general applicability ? to investigate this , we examined core convection during hydrogen burning . because of the long thermal time scale for radiative diffusion in such stars , we focus on the hydrodynamic behavior of a model in which the inner boundary provides a driving luminosity about ten times larger than natural .",
    "this allows us to simulate the convection with our compressible hydrodynamics code ; an anelastic method ( if multi - fluid ) would allow this to be done in the star s natural time scale . while our calculation is not thermally relaxed on a helmholtz - kelvin time scale , it does relax dynamically , and provides some clue as to the convective behavior .",
    "we have previously evolved a 23  star onto the main sequence with tycho , to an age of 2.410@xmath86 yrs , at which point hydrogen is burning in a convective core .",
    "the model is then mapped onto the prompi hydrodynamics grid for simulation .",
    "this model represents an early point in main sequence evolution , in which the core hydrogen content has been depleted by only 1.7% ( @xmath87 = 0.689 , @xmath88 = 0.701 , @xmath89 = 0.012 ) .",
    "the inner radius of the simulation was chosen such that the convectively unstable region covers @xmath691 pressure scale height ( convective cores are usually only of order a pressure scale height because of the divergence of the scale height towards the stellar center ) .",
    "the entire domain covers @xmath695 pressure scale heights and @xmath693.3 density scale heights .",

    "the luminosity due to nuclear burning in the computational domain is a small fraction of the total stellar luminosity ( 2.4% ) which is dominated by burning in the inner regions of the core and @xmath94 .",
    "core burning is incorporated into the simulation as an input luminosity at the inner boundary of the computational domain .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz timescale for this model is @xmath95 years , which is many orders of magnitude longer than the dynamical timescales that are feasible to simulate .",
    "additionally , the small luminosity of the star produces a convective velocity scale that is very subsonic ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "since we are not interested in the thermal relaxation of the model , we have boosted the input luminosity by a factor of 10 to increase the velocity scale of the flow .",
    "this was necessary because our fully compressible code is limited by the sound crossing time .",

    "opacities approximated by thompson scattering , which agrees well with the opal opacities @xcite used in the 1d tycho model for the region simulated .",
    "the effects of radiative diffusion , however , are found to be unresolved in the current simulation ( with the diffusion time across a single zone @xmath97 , with grid zone size @xmath98 ) and therefore energy transport in the convection zone occurs primarily on the subgrid level due to numerical diffusion . this is a high pclet number simulation .",

    "fluctuations in the flow ; ( 2 ) the difference between the horizontally averaged background value and the mean values in the up and down flowing material .    the temperature fluctuations calculated using these two methods are presented in figure [ tpert - fig ] .",

    "the sharp decrease in the effective mixing length near the lower boundary is not entirely surprising .",
    "the distance to the convective boundary provides an upper limit to the mixing length , while further away from the boundaries the mixing length is limited by the distance over which eddies can maintain their coherence .",
    "this effect is possibly more exaggerated at the lower boundary because of the steep gradient in velocity which is needed to move the energy out of the burning zone .",
    "in contrast , the upper boundary is characterized by a more gentle deceleration of material and a `` softer '' boundary ( i.e. , lower @xmath155 ) .",
    "ignoring this boundary effect and using the same mixing length parameter throughout the convection zone would result in a shallower temperature gradient near the boundary .",

    "physically , this translates into a higher efficiency ( by a factor @xmath691.2 - 1.7 ) for the buoyancy work to accelerate the large eddies over the value of 1/2 adopted above , which is reasonable considering the heuristic argument used .",
    "alternatively , agreement can be made by scaling the temperature fluctuations in equation [ mlt - tpert - eq ] by the same ratio , which amounts to decreasing the distance over which eddies remain coherent and adiabatic as they move across the convection zone .",
    "both of the these effects are plausible , as well as a combination of the two so long as the ratio is maintained . which is operating in the present simulation ?",
    "unfortunately , the degeneracy between these two parameters can not be broken because they combine linearly when calculating the enthalpy flux , which therefore does not provide a further constraint . finally , _",
    "it is possible that the effective mixing lengths for temperature and velocity fluctuations are different _ , a notion that is supported by the correlation lengths which we discuss next .      in the top two panels of figure [ vscale - fig ] the vertical correlation",

    "based on this simple diagnostic both the temperature and velocity correlations indicate that the eddies near the lower boundary are flattened on the bottom , and those at the upper boundary are flattened on the top . the `` overshooting '' distance ( @xmath172 cm at the upper boundary and @xmath173 cm at the lower boundary ) , which is best described as an elastic response to the incoming turbulent elements , is very small compared to the correlation lengths measured here",

    "the correlation length scales are smaller than the mixing length values by as much as a factor of a few . _ in an analogous comparison by @xcite for subgiant atmosphere models , the vertical correlation lengths were also found to be smaller than the mixing length used to construct the initial model , and that the ratio varied significantly throughout the convection zone .",
    "the horizontal correlation lengths @xmath179 are shown in figure [ hvscale - fig ] together with the vertical scales for comparison .",
    "for the velocity , the horizontal scale is much smaller than the vertical , indicative of eddies which are significantly elongated in the vertical direction .",
    "the temperature fluctuations appear to be much more symmetric , with only a small degree of elongation in the vertical direction which is slightly more pronounced near the top of the convection zone . in the stable layers ,",
    "the horizontal scales are larger than the vertical , which is a characteristic of the horizontal `` sloshing '' motions associated with g - modes .",

    "we note that @xcite have shown that ppm methods solving the euler equations converge to the same limit as solutions to the navier - stokes equations , as resolution is increased and viscosity reduced .",
    "additionally , the subgrid scale turbulence `` model '' implicit in the numerical algorithm of ppm is known to be well behaved ( fernando grinstein , personal communication ) .",
    "given this already inhomogeneous set of simulations , determining consistent convection parameters is difficult . our attempt is given in table [ conv - table ] , in which we summarize the convection parameters found in these studies for comparison to our own .",
    "how well do these compare ?",
    "in some respects the agreement is striking .",
    "the parameter @xmath131 is in the range @xmath690.7 - 0.8 for all groups .",
    "further , all agree that for their case , the mixing - length theory gives a fairly reasonable representation of the simulations in the sense that the alphas are roughly constant throughout the body of the convection zone .",
    "the difficulty is that the specific values of these alphas depend upon the case considered .",
    "the two best - resolved simulations , ours and @xcite , use the same solution method , ppm , yet have the most differing alphas .",

    "there is a suggestion in table  [ conv - table ] that the alphas increase with the depth of the convection zone",
    ". this would be reasonable if a convective plume were accelerated through the whole convection region before it is decelerated at the nonconvective boundary .",
    "however , the other differences mentioned above probably contribute to the scatter in the alpha parameters in [ conv - table ] .",
    "further efforts on this issue are needed . if convection does depend upon the nonlocal , physical structure of the star , calibration of the mixing length to fit the sun , as is traditionally done ,",
    "is not wise .",

    "each stage is well described by a linear increase of radius with time , and ends with a rapid adjustment to a new entrainment rate .",
    "this behavior can also be seen in figure [ ob3d - evol ] , where the change in entrainment rate is coincident with changes in the background composition gradient and stability ( compare to the initial buoyancy frequency profile in figure [ ob - profile ] ) .",
    "the downward migration of the lower shell boundary is more uniform and proceeds at a significantly reduced rate compared to the upper boundary .",
    "the core convection boundary evolution departs most significantly from a linear trend , but monotonic growth is clearly established very soon after the simulation begins @xmath215s .",

    "the interface migration rates and averaged interfacial layer thicknesses are tabulated for all of the models in tables [ ob - entrain - table ] and [ msc - entrain - table ] , and are broken down into various time intervals over which linear growth of the boundary is a good approximation .",
    "time averaged mass entrainment rates are also included in tables [ ob - table ] and [ msc - table ] .      in order for entrainment to take place at a convective boundary the buoyancy increment of the stable layer material over that of the mixed layer material",
    "must be overcome .",
    "this can happen in two distinct ways .",
    "first , non - adiabatic processes can change the relative stability of the stable layer .",
    "for example , heating the convective region will cause an increase in its entropy , and the buoyancy jump separating the overlying layer will decrease .",
    "the rate at which the convective boundary will grow due to heating is @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the radial gradient of entropy at the boundary and @xmath220 is the time rate of change of entropy in the shell .",
    "this process will cause both the upper and lower boundaries to migrate to larger radii  the upper boundary will be weakened , while the lower boundary will become stiffer .",
    "non - adiabatic processes in the boundary layers will affect their stability in the same way : cooling in the upper and heating in the lower boundaries will weaken their stratification .",
    "a related , but distinct process is `` turbulent entrainment '' whereby turbulent kinetic energy does work against gravity to draw material into the turbulent region . in this process",
    ", the stratification is weakened at a convective boundary by the turbulent velocity fluctuations .",
    "this is quantified in terms of the buoyancy flux @xmath221 . in the absence of heating and cooling sources",
    "the buoyancy in the interfacial layers will evolve according to the buoyancy conservation equation ,    @xmath222    and a positive flux divergence at the boundary will lead to a weakening of the stratification .",
    "the relationship between turbulent entrainment and the weakening of a boundary through heating and cooling can be understood in terms of the enthalpy flux which attends the buoyancy flux .",
    "in fact , the buoyancy flux is directly related to the enthalpy flux across the interface ,    @xmath223    and is equivalent to heating and cooling processes operating in the boundary layer ( note the downward directed enthalpy flux within the boundary layers in figure [ fenth - fig ] ) .",
    "what drives the entrainment seen in the present simulations ? can the entrainment in the outer shell boundary be explained by the heating of the convection zone by nuclear burning ? comparing the entropy growth rate of the shell to the entropy gradient at the boundary we find @xmath224 cm / s , which is at most 17% of the measured growth rate for this boundary , and typically of order a few percent .",
    "shell heating will reduce the growth rate of the lower boundary by @xmath225 cm / s , which is of order a few percent of the rate measured .",
    "therefore , the overall heating and cooling of the shell contributes very modestly to the growth of the shell over the course of the simulation .",
    "the long thermal timescale in the core convection model reduces this effect even more , where it is lower by several orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , we turn to the turbulent hydrodynamic processes operating in the boundary layer to understand the growth of the convection zones .    in figure",
    "[ qflux - fig ] we present the buoyancy flux profiles for our 3d simulation models , including both time - series diagrams and time averaged radial profiles .",
    "the properties of the buoyancy flux can be divided into three distinct flow regimes : ( 1 ) the body of the buoyant convecting layer , which is dominated by positive @xmath226 ; ( 2 ) the convective boundary layers , with negative @xmath226 ; ( 3 ) the stably stratified layers , where @xmath226 is oscillatory , but has a nearly zero mean ( in both a horizontal and time average sense ) .",
    "the buoyancy driving of the convective flow in regime ( 1 ) can be appreciated by comparing the flow velocity to the commonly used buoyant convection velocity scale @xmath227 , where integration is taken over the radial extent of the convection zone ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath228 for the 3d shell burning and core convection models are @xmath229cm / s and @xmath230 cm / s , which compare well to the radial r.m.s .",
    "turbulent velocities measured in the simulation ( figures [ ob-2d-3d - vrms ] and [ msc-2d-3d - vrms ] ) .    in regime",
    "( 2 ) , which occurs in the convective boundaries , the buoyancy flux is negative .",
    "a negative value of @xmath226 signifies that the turbulent kinetic energy is being converted into potential energy .",
    "the mixing that attends this negative buoyancy flux underlies the entrainment that is taking place at the boundaries through equation [ buoyancy - conserve - eq ] .",
    "we demonstrate this by showing that the entrainment speeds measured in the simulation are consistent with the measured buoyancy fluxes . the interface migration speed is incorporated into the conservation equation by writing the time derivative as an advective derivative ,    @xmath231    where we have used the relationship @xmath232 . using this time derivative in equation [ buoyancy - conserve - eq ] and solving for @xmath17",
    "we find ,    @xmath233    where we have approximated the divergence of the buoyancy flux with the difference @xmath234 .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath235 to distinguish the estimated rate from the values measured in the simulation .",
    "if we adopt the buoyancy flux at the interface for @xmath236 ( figure [ qflux - fig ] ) , the measured interface thickness @xmath66 , and the buoyancy frequency at the boundary , we find the following entrainment rates . for the upper shell boundary , lower shell boundary , and the core convection boundary we have : @xmath237 cm / s ; @xmath238 cm / s ; and @xmath239 cm / s , respectively .",
    "these are to be compared with @xmath240 measured in section ",
    "[ quantify - entrainment - section ] and presented in tables [ ob - entrain - table ] and [ msc - entrain - table ] .",
    "the values corresponding to the same time period are : @xmath241 cm / s ; @xmath242 cm / s ; and @xmath243 cm / s .",
    "although these estimates are only order of magnitude ( e.g. , using the crude approximation for the time derivative in eq .",
    "[ [ buoyancy - time - deriv - eq ] ] ) they compare well to the values measured in the simulations and the buoyancy flux due to `` turbulent entrainment '' can account for the growth of the convective layers seen here .",
    "the buoyancy flux @xmath226 appears as a term in the turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) equation , which we present in  [ energy - appendix ] ( eq . [ [ tke - eq ] ] ) . in our notation ,",
    "the buoyancy flux is related to the buoyancy work term by @xmath244 . the buoyancy flux , therefore , is related to the rate at which turbulent kinetic energy is advected into the stable layer @xmath189 , the rate at which it dissipates through viscous forces @xmath245 , and the rate at which energy is transported through the boundary layer by pressure - velocity correlations @xmath246 .",
    "in essence , entrainment is the process by which the turbulent kinetic energy in the boundary layer does work against gravity to increase the potential energy of the overall stratification .",
    "two theoretical approaches have been taken to study entrainment .",
    "the first approach ignores the tke equation and instead posits an `` entrainment law '' .",
    "the entrainment law is merely a functional form for the rate at which stable layer mass will flow into the turbulent region , and is therefore a dynamic boundary condition .",
    "these laws are usually parameterized by the stability properties of the interface and the strength of the turbulence through @xmath19 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "once an entrainment law is adopted , the enthalpy flux can be calculated and the evolution of the boundary can be self - consistently solved for .",
    "the advantage of such an entrainment law is the simplicity with which it can be incorporated into global circulation models of the atmosphere , for instance .",
    "an alternative approach to adopting an entrainment law is an explicit physical model for the terms in the tke equation ( eq . [ [ tke - eq ] ] ) .",
    "for example , general forms for the buoyancy flux profile within the stable layer have been applied with some success in reproducing the growth of the atmospheric boundary layer and the deepening of the oceanic thermocline @xcite . in some respects , however , these models are glorified entrainment laws since the buoyancy flux is prescribed in a simplified , parameterized way . moving beyond assumptions concerning",
    "the turbulence profiles within the interfacial layer , are theoretical models which take into account the interactions of waves and turbulence and incorporate non - linear models for the evolution of instabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the approach adopted in these theoretical studies is general enough that any adjustable parameters may turn out to be universal and a predictive model can be developed .",
    "in addition , the framework employed is general enough that the production of turbulence by mean flows ( i.e. , stellar rotation ) can be incorporated , as well as long - range effects due to internal waves .",
    "the internal waves are incorporated through the pressure - correlation flux , @xmath246 , and plays a central role in the evolution of the buoyancy flux when wave breaking is important .",
    "the development of a sophisticated turbulence model to explain entrainment is beyond the scope of the present work . instead , we ask to what extent do the entrainment laws used in geophysical models apply to our simulations and stellar interiors ?",
    "guided by laboratory study and geophysical large eddy simulation we study the dependance of the entrainment rate on the bulk richardson number .",
    "@xmath19 is calculated according to equation [ rib - eq ] , where we use the horizontal correlation length scale @xmath247 defined in  [ correlation - appendix ] .",
    "the buoyancy jump is calculated by performing the integration in equation [ buoyancy - equation ] over the width of the interface which we take to be the interval @xmath248 $ ] .",
    "the normalized entrainment rates @xmath249 , the buoyancy jumps @xmath10 , and @xmath19 are presented in tables [ ob - entrain - table ] and [ msc - entrain - table ] .",
    "the dependance of the entrainment coefficient @xmath16 on @xmath19 is presented in figure [ entrain - law - fig ] .",
    "the 2d and 3d data are found to obey similar trends ( lower e for higher @xmath19 ) , but occupy signifanctly different regions of the diagram .",
    "this can be explained by the much higher r.m.s .",
    "velocities in the 2d simulation .",
    "the velocity scale in 2d is apparently an artifact of the reduced dimensionality of the problem which significantly influences the flow morphology .",
    "although the velocity scale is higher in the 2d models , it is much more laminar and accompanied by less turbulent mixing .",
    "the arrow in figure [ entrain - law - fig ] indicates the direction that the 2d data points would move if a lower effective r.m.s .",
    "velocity were assumed . in what follows",
    "we focus our attention exclusively on the entrainment data found for the more realistic 3d models .",
    "what we find is that the entrainment coefficient @xmath16 is well described by a power law dependance on @xmath19 of the form in equation [ entrainment - law - equation ] .",
    "our best fit values for the parameters are @xmath250 and @xmath6 .",
    "this entrainment law is shown by a dashed line in figure [ entrain - law - fig ] . remarkably , the power law is of order unity , in agreement with geophysical and laboratory studies .",
    "the fact that the entrainment in our simulations are governed by the same , fairly universal dependance on @xmath19 as these other studies may have been anticipated , considering the striking degree of similarity between the buoyancy profiles and the character of the developed flow in the vicinity of the boundary ( figure [ boundary - snapshots - fig ] ) .",
    "mass entrainment is a fundamentally different phenomena from diffusion , which is the typical route used to incorporate new mixing phenomena into a stellar evolution code .",
    "therefore , how might we incorporate this new process ?",
    "schematically , the idea is very simple . for each convective boundary , initially found with the traditional stability criteria ( @xmath251 , @xmath252 ) , we can calculate the associated bulk richardson number based on the background stratification and an approximation of the turbulence characteristics ( e.g. , from mlt ) . with @xmath19 in hand we can then input this into our entrainment law , @xmath253 which returns to us the entrainment rate .",
    "the entrainment rate , therefore , is the boundary growth rate as a function of @xmath19 and possibly other parameters of the system .",
    "the function @xmath254 can be broken up into at least three regimes for convenience .",
    "_ low stability : _ @xmath255 . for low @xmath19",
    "it is observed that mass entrainment happens very quickly , on an advection timescale (  [ transient - section ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can define a minimum @xmath256 at which the expansion of the convection zone will proceed very quickly , eliminating convective boundaries which are too weak to support the adjacent turbulence .",
    "_ intermediate stability : @xmath257_. for an intermediate range of stability , we can use the fairly universal entrainment law which matches our simulation data , defined by the two parameters @xmath23 and @xmath258 .",
    "although scatter in mixing rates were found to be as large as a factor of a few relative to the best fit law , the general monotonic , power - law dependance was found to be robust .",
    "we can incorporate this physics into the stellar evolution code as a mass entrainment rate ,    @xmath259    where the normalization factor is written @xmath260 and represents the turbulent entrainment mixing efficiency .",
    "more sophistication can subsequently be incorporated as our understanding of the entrainment process improves .    _",
    "high stability : @xmath261_. the entrainment process will cease to operate at some upper limit @xmath262 , above which the boundary evolution will be controlled by diffusive processes on the molecular scale .",
    "following @xcite , we have ,    @xmath263    which is based on the condition that the kinetic energy in the turbulence is sufficient to lift the material from the interface , @xmath264 . here",
    ", the interface thickness is taken to be that due to molecular diffusion with @xmath265 .",
    "the relatively small diffusion rates in stellar interiors imply that turbulent entrainment will continue to operate to very high richardson numbers . for comparison ,",
    "the entrainment process in the ocean is estimated to operate up to @xmath266 .",
    "additional details concerning the implementation of this type of boundary condition into tycho will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "we conclude this section with a few comments on how well simulation can be trusted in elucidating the process of entrainment , which is not very well understood .",
    "the spatial scales which limit the entrainment rate at a convective boundary are not also not well understood , and depend on the interplay between large eddy and small scale turbulent transport processes . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", there is feedback between the transport rate away from the turbulent boundary layer which is controlled by large eddies , and the transport rate of material in the immediate vicinity of the interface by small scale turbulence .",
    "a full understanding of this problem hinges on being able to resolve the entrainment zone in the presence of the large scale eddies .",
    "a code comparison and resolution study of the entrainment problem in the planetary boundary layer context was conducted by @xcite and @xcite . in these studies , it was suggested that the appropriate criteria for resolving boundary layer entrainment is that the grid zoning is smaller than the fluctuations induced in the inversion layer by the large eddies so that shear instabilities ( e.g. , kelvin - helmholtz ) would not be suppressed . it was suggested that a `` nested grid '' of refinement within the boundary layer was comparable to using fine resolution throughout the simulation domain .",
    "the suggested resolution criterion in these papers , however , fail to account for the non - linear turbulent evolution which proceeds the onset of instabilities .",
    "in addition , no simulations were conducted with enough resolution that the boundary layers were turbulent , and the simulations presented were even marginally resolved by the author s suggested criteria .",
    "a related study by @xcite investigates the entrainment and mixing at a boundary due to internal gravity wave breaking driven by a shear flow .",
    "this process may be operating in the shear mixing layers that form when large eddies impact the boundary layer . in this study ,",
    "the mass entrainment rate was found to depend on the numerical resolution in a non - monotonic way , first decreasing and then increasing with finer resolution .",
    "the author concludes that low resolution models are dominated by numerical diffusion until the resolution is fine enough to resolve turbulence near the boundary , at which point the entrainment rate begins to increase and is controlled by turbulent transport .",
    "although the asymptotic mixing rate was inconclusive and no resolution criteria was proposed , resolving the turbulence ensuing from the instability was shown to be important .",
    "much more work needs to be done to address the role played by both the small scale processes and the interplay with large eddies .",
    "two complimentary numerical approaches can be taken .",
    "first , the feedback between large and small scale mixing and transport processes can be studied using large eddy simulation with a range of subgrid scale mixing efficiencies .",
    "such a study can help develop insight into which scales control the mixing rate .",
    "second , direct numerical simulations ( dns ) which resolve the turbulent processes operating at the interface can be undertaken when sufficient computational resources are available .",
    "these studies would provide more definitive conclusions concerning the interplay between eddy scales and would provide guidance for a more general framework for future theoretical analysis .",
    "finally , it is important to keep in mind that laboratory studies of high reynolds number turbulent entrainment continue to provide useful constraints , and improved flow visualization techniques are allowing a more direct comparison to theory and simulation .",
    "the `` empirical '' entrainment law which we discuss in this paper is constrained by only a few data points ( the six 3d data points in figure [ entrain - law - fig ] ) . extending simulations to include",
    "an ever more diverse suite of stellar structures would provide an even stronger mandate , and better constrained model for incorporating this physics into stellar evolution codes .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the results of three - dimensional , reactive , compressible , hydrodynamic simulations of deep , efficient stellar convection zones in massive stars .",
    "our models are unique in terms of the degree to which non - idealized physics have been used , and the evolutionary stages simulated , with fuel and ash clearly distinguished .",
    "we find several general results regarding the basic properties of the convective flow :    * the flow is highly intermittent , but has robust statistical properties , * the 2d vs 3d velocity scales differ by almost a factor of several , and the flow morphologies are completely different , * stable layers interact with convection to decelerate plumes , and consequently distort these layers , which then generate waves , * mixing is found to occur at convective boundaries in manner best described as turbulent entrainment , rather than the traditional picture of convective overshooting wherein turbulent eddies ballistically penetrate the stable layers .",
    "we have compared our oxygen shell burning model to mixing length theory assumptions .",
    "we show that , while a reasonable representation of the super - adiabatic temperature gradient and velocity scale can be fit with a single mixing length , the values of the inferred mixing - length `` constants '' differ from other simulations .",
    "this was already implied in @xcite , who found difference for slab and spherical geometries",
    ". there may be a dependence upon the depth of the convection zone as well , and possibly upon the nature of the stable boundary regions and/or the nature of the driving process ( burning or radiative loss ) .",
    "why do we care about mlt in regions of efficient convection ? ( 1 ) temperature profile can affect the burning rates , which have a stiff temperature dependence ; ( 2 ) the velocity scale can affect the nucleosynthesis ( such as s - process branching ratios in double shell burning agb stars ) by dictating the exposure time of the plasma to varying conditions throughout the burning region ; ( 3 ) the velocity scale and the kinetic energy flux is an important input needed for calculating the mixing at convective boundaries .",
    "we have found that the extent of mixing is better represented by an integrated richardson number rather than the convectional schwarzschild or ledoux criteria alone .",
    "this incorporates the addition physics related to the resistance of stiff boundaries to mixing .",
    "related to the definition of boundary stiffness , we have identified an important physical process which is missing from the standard theory of stellar evolution : turbulent entrainment .",
    "this process is well known in the meteorology and oceanographic communities , and has been extensively studied experimentally .",
    "we show that the rate of entrainment is well represented as a simple function of the buoyancy jump , in a manner similar to that determined experimentally .",
    "the long term consequences of convective boundary inconsistencies such as the one illustrated by the initial transient in our simulation , and for which the conditions are common in 1d stellar models , can significantly alter the size of convective cores , and thus the subsequent explosion and nucleosynthetic yields of the resultant supernova .",
    "in a subsequent paper in this series , we will present case studies which incorporate the physical insight gained through these simulations into the tycho stellar evolution code . we expect to see effects in solar models , s - processing in agb stars , stellar core formation ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes ) , stellar nucleosynthesis yields , stellar ages , and hr diagrams .",

    "<S> we describe the results of three - dimensional ( 3d ) numerical simulations designed to study turbulent convection in the stellar interiors , and compare them to stellar mixing - length theory ( mlt ) . </S>",
    "<S> simulations in 2d are significantly different from 3d , both in terms of flow morphology and velocity amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> convective mixing regions are better predicted using a _ dynamic boundary condition _ based on the bulk richardson number than by purely local , static criteria like schwarzschild or ledoux . </S>",
    "<S> mlt gives a good description of the velocity scale and temperature gradient for a mixing length of @xmath0 for shell convection , however there are other important effects that it does not capture , mostly related to the dynamical motion of the boundaries between convective and nonconvective regions . </S>",
    "<S> there is asymmetry between up and down flows , so the net kinetic energy flux is not zero . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of convective boundaries is a source of gravity waves ; this is a necessary consequence of the deceleration of convective plumes . </S>",
    "<S> convective `` overshooting '' is best described as an elastic response by the convective boundary , rather than ballistic penetration of the stable layers by turbulent eddies . </S>",
    "<S> the convective boundaries are rife with internal and interfacial wave motions , and a variety of instabilities arise which induce mixing through in process best described as turbulent entrainment . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rate at which material entrainment proceeds at the boundaries is consistent with analogous laboratory experiments as well as simulation and observation of terrestrial atmospheric mixing . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the normalized entrainment rate e=@xmath1 , is well described by a power law dependance on the bulk richardson number @xmath2 for the conditions studied , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath4 , with best fit values , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the applicability of these results to stellar evolution calculations . </S>"
