    "one of the most interesting ideas introduced in inflationary cosmology in recent years is the possibility of performing a phase transition _ during _ inflation . in such scenarios ,",
    "two fields act on stage : one , say @xmath1 , slow rolls , driving enough inflation to solve the standard problems ; the second field , say @xmath2 , tunnels from a false vacuum state to an energetically favoured true vacuum state , producing _ bubbles _ of the new phase embedded in the old one .",
    "both processes are governed by a two - field potential @xmath3 . to avoid the graceful exit problem",
    ", the true vacuum state has to allow for a period of inflation on its own .",
    "we can then speak of a true vacuum _",
    "channel _ over which the bubbles slow roll until inflation ends , and reheating takes over . depending on the potential , three classes of first - order inflation models have been proposed so far .",
    "the first is the classical extended inflation @xcite : the bubbles are produced in a copious quantity , so that they eventually fill the space and complete the transition . to avoid too large distortions on the cmb",
    ", this scenario must produce very small bubbles@xcite , so that they are rapidly thermalized after inflation .",
    "no trace of the bubbles is left in our universe , and from this point of view such scenarios do not lead to new predictions over inflation without bubble production .",
    "the second class is the @xmath4 inflation@xcite : here the transition is never completed , so that each bubble resembles an open universe to inside observers .",
    "therefore , if the bubbles inflate for less than the canonical @xmath5 or so @xmath6-foldings , they will approach an @xmath4 universe . here",
    "the effect of the nucleation process is observable , although it is indistinguishable from a slow roll inflation just shorter than @xmath7 @xmath6-foldings and with no first - order phase transition at all .",
    "finally , in @xcite a third class of models has been proposed , following an early suggestion of la @xcite . in such models ,",
    "the phase transition is completed _ before _ the end of inflation .",
    "then , it has been shown that the primordial bubbles can be large enough to drive structure formation , and still be below the cmb level of detection@xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the present large scale structure is a direct outcome of the first order transition , which is therefore observable and testable .",
    "several deep redshift surveys detected large voids in the galaxy distribution@xcite , although it is still not clear if they are really empty of matter or just lack luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "standard models of galaxy formation can barely accounts for these structure , and do so only at the price of adjusting the parameters to get very large scale power ( see e.g. ref .",
    "therefore , just as we associate matter clumps to primordial fluctuations , it appears worth trying to associate the present voids to primordial bubble - like fluctuations , produced during a first - order phase transition . within different contexts",
    ", the idea of the voids as separate dynamical entities has been investigated several times in earlier literature @xcite .",
    "a crucial aspect of bubble inflation is the calculation of the bubble spectrum @xmath8 , defined as the number of bubbles per horizon with comoving size larger than @xmath9 . in @xcite we calculated @xmath10 in a specific model , built on fourth order gravity @xcite , which we found to possess the requested features .",
    "we found that @xmath8 can be approximated by a power law , n_b=(l_m",
    "/ l)^ p , and that @xmath11 can be as large as the observed voids in the universe .",
    "the central quantity needed to evaluate @xmath10 is the nucleation rate in the semiclassical limit @xcite [ tunnrate ] = m^4 ( -b ) where @xmath12 is a constant with a dimension of mass , and @xmath13 is the euclidean least action minus the action for the external desitter spacetime solution .",
    "the calculation of @xmath14 in @xcite ( and in most other papers on the topic ) was based on the thin - wall limit , on neglecting the gravitational correction , and on a dimensional argument for evaluating @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we remove , at least partially , all three approximations .",
    "this calculation allows us to reconstruct completely the inflationary two - field potential from the determination of four observable quantities : the slope of the bubble spectrum , its amplitude , the density contrast inside the bubbles , and the amplitude of the ordinary slow - rolling fluctuations .",
    "we remark that only in a model , like ours , in which the bubbles are directly observable , it is possible to reconstruct the tunneling sector of the primordial potential .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present the class of potentials we are going to investigate . in sec .",
    "3 we give the basic formulas . in sec . 4,5 , and 6",
    "we go through the detailed calculation of @xmath14 , taking into account deviations from the thin wall limit , inserting the gravitational correction and calculating explicitely the factor @xmath12 . in sec .",
    "7 we introduce our model of first - order inflation in a fourth - order gravity theory @xcite and calculate the time - dependent nucleation rate . in sec .",
    "8 we write down the bubble spectrum and in sec .",
    "9 finally we compare it with constraints from cmb and large scale structure . in the last section",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider the scalar field theory described by the action ( hereinafter , @xmath15 ) [ norms ] s = d^4x \\ { -r16 g + -u ( ) } where @xmath16 is the metric determinant and @xmath17 the curvature scalar .",
    "the potential is a generic quartic function with non - degenerate minima which allows for tunneling .",
    "we can write it very generally in the form [ general ] u()=+v_1()+v_2 ( ) where @xmath18 is a cosmological constant , @xmath19 is a quartic with two equal - energy minima and @xmath20 is a symmetry - breaking potential which brings the energy of one minimum , the false vacuum ( subscript f ) , to a value larger than the other , the true vacuum ( subscript t ) . in the two minima ,",
    "the einstein equation reduces simply to h^2=8 g u/3 we will denote with @xmath21 the hubble constant and the potential energy of the true vacuum , and with @xmath22 the same quantities for the false vacuum .",
    "we wish to calculate the tunneling rate ( [ tunnrate ] ) where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the euclidean least action , i.e. the action of the `` bounce '' solution .",
    "we perform the computation in the thin - wall limit ( actually we go to a post - thin - wall limit calculation ) , according to which the @xmath25 bubbles nucleated have 4-radius @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the wall thickness .",
    "further , we include the gravitational term in the action : as we will show , this term is important when the parameter @xmath28 ( not to be confused with the metric determinant ) is much larger than unity .",
    "this limit amounts in fact to a bubble approaching the space curvature radius @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient to write the potential ( [ general ] ) in the form [ potphys ] u()=3g^28 g r^2 + 12 ^ 2_0 ^ 2 ( ^2-_0 ^ 2)^2 + 1r(+_0)^2 then , the true vacuum state is @xmath30 , and the false vacuum is @xmath31 .",

    "the euclidean action , finally , is calculated as [ bpost ] b = s()-s(_0)= b_0(1 - 9/2r ) the term @xmath69 is therefore the post - thin - wall correction term , which again increases the tunneling rate .",

    "it can be seen that these curves cross the acceptable region ; our model is therefore capable of producing bubble spectra which pass the cmb tests and have interesting large scale features .",
    "let us consider one pair of parameters for reference : @xmath194 , @xmath195 , which lies on the curve @xmath196 , and is inside the acceptable region .",
    "then , from ( [ snnn ] ) , and putting @xmath197 and @xmath161 , we have that the full set of @xmath6-folding parameters is n_0=54 , n_1=17 , n_2=16 , n_3=90 which verifies ( [ fullset ] ) ; we have also @xmath198 . clearly , this is only one of an infinite set of parameters that fulfills all the conditions ; however , the values are in general close to those quoted",
    ". we may also note that with such a bubble spectrum , @xmath194 and @xmath199 , one can estimate @xmath200 voids larger than 20 @xmath183 by radius in a spherical survey of depth @xmath201 ; this value , which of course is extremely approximate , is indicative that many , if not all , of the present voids can be explained by a first - order phase transition .",
    "finally , the potential parameters , other than @xmath131 , are ( all in planck units ) = 410 ^ -3,m=3.3 10 ^ -3,_0=1.810 ^ -3 thus , as anticipated in the introduction , the observations of the two bubble spectrum parameters , @xmath202 and @xmath175 , of the matter content inside bubbles ( so to fix @xmath166 ) , and of the ordinary fluctuations driven by @xmath98 on the microwave background , which give @xmath131 , are in principle all what we need to completely reconstruct the primordial first - order potential .",
    "this would be impossible in the other models of first - order inflation , in which bubbles do not leave observable traces .",
    "large voids are ubiquitous in the universe . they occupy most of the observable volume , and are probably the dominant contribution to the large scale power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the standard possibility is that they simply derive from the primordial underdensities which are expected in the ordinary gaussian models of structure formation .",
    "however , this scenario would be put in jeopardy if larger and larger voids continue to be discovered @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the voids are actually filled with unclustered , or mildly clustered , matter , it would be impossible to explain their roughly spherical shape : an underdensity , in fact , becomes more and more spherical only as it becomes non - linear @xcite .",
    "it is therefore worthy to investigate alternatives .",
    "we proposed here , basing on earlier work @xcite@xcite , a first - order inflationary model which produces primordial non - empty bubbles , along with ordinary slow - rolling fluctuations .",
    "we calculated in detail the nucleation rate , including classical , quantum and gravitational corrections , and showed that the model gives a strong contribution to large scale structure , while passing the microwave constraints .",
    "the determination of four observable quantities completely fixes the primordial potential , including the tunneling sector , which , on the contrary , is unobservable in the other models of first - order inflation .    d. la and p.j .",
