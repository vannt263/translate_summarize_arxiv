    "we report a template fit to the fermi data , which allows a simultaneous determination of the foreground and fermi bubble signature in all sky directions , including the galactic plane .",
    "the idea is simple : one knows the energy spectra of the main contributions to the gamma - ray sky from accelerator experiments .",
    "if these foregrounds describe the data , one should be able to describe the gamma - ray spectra by a linear combination from the different foreground spectra ( templates ) .",
    "the normalisation of each template is left free in a @xmath3 fit .",
    "additional contributions will be apparent from a poor @xmath3 . adding the template needed for the bubbles improved the @xmath3 in specific regions . with this method",
    "we reproduce the observed fermi bubbles in the halo , but find additionally bubble - like emission in star - forming regions in the plane .",
    "the bubble template best describing the data corresponds to the hard proton cr spectra expected for shock wave acceleration by supernovae remnants @xcite , which already indicates that the fermi bubbles might be connected to crs at the time when they are still trapped in sources , called `` source crs '' ( scrs ) by @xcite .",
    "this observation is in line with the fact that propagation models , which do not include these scrs , underpredict the gamma - ray production in the plane @xcite .",

    "we strengthen this interpretation by the novel template fitting method , which does not depend on the propagation model and allows for a fine spatial resolution .",
    "we have analysed the diffuse gamma - rays in the energy range between 0.1 and 100 gev using the diffuse class of the public p7rep_source_v15 data collected from august , 2008 till july 2014 ( 72 months ) by the fermi space telescope @xcite .",

    "although the fermi - lat satellite has full sky coverage we concentrate on the region towards the gc where the bubbles have been observed .",
    "we divided the sky in 41 3@xmath4 bins in latitude and 25 5@xmath4 bins in longitude , which leads to a coverage of 123 ( 125)@xmath4 in latitude ( longitude ) .",
    "this region - of - interest with 41x25 = 1025 subcones was centred on the gc .",
    "the diffuse gamma - rays trace the distribution of cosmic rays , since the crs collide sometimes with the gas or isrf , which leads to energetic gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "the flux is proportional to the product of the cr densities , the `` target densities '' ( gas or isrf ) and the cross sections , but a template fit lumps the product of these three factors into a single normalisation factor for each gamma - ray component @xmath5 , thus eliminating their individual uncertainties .",
    "the total flux in a given direction can be described as a linear combination of the various contributions with known energy spectra ( templates ) : @xmath6 where the normalisation factors @xmath7 determine the fraction of the total flux for a given contribution .",
    "the normalisations @xmath7 can be found from a @xmath3 fit , which tries to adjust the templates to best describe the data . since the number of data points in each spectrum for a given subcone ( 21 energy bins ) is large compared with the number of free parameters ( @xmath8 ) the fit is strongly constrained , thus allowing a precise determination of the various template contributions in each direction .    as test statistic we use the @xmath3 function defined as : @xmath9 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where data(i , j ) is the fermi flux in direction @xmath10 for energy bin @xmath11 , template(i , j , k ) with normalisation @xmath12",

    "the negligible differences are due to the varying magnetic field in the galaxy . for inverse compton",

    "the isotropic component by @xmath19 from its nominal fst value worsened the fit .",
    "we take the normalisations of the br and ic templates to be 100% correlated , since they are both proportional to the electron number density .",
    "the ratio @xmath20 of the two templates is given by the ratio of cross sections times target densities ( gas and isrf ) , which was taken from the dragon program for each sky direction .",
    "so in total we have only 2 free parameters to describe the foreground in each subcone , namely @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "a few regions with a high @xmath3 ( i.e. a poor fit ) at high latitudes have been excluded .",

    "one observes a tail in the point sources similar to the shape of the bubble template , as expected if the bubble - like contribution is related to unresolved snrs .",
    "these are expected predominantly in molecular clouds . since the latter have a narrower latitude distribution than the hi gas component , one expects for the bubble - like emission a narrower latitude distribution in comparison with the diffuse emission .",

    "the hi layer has a wider distribution of 230 pc fwhm @xcite . to obtain the width in latitude of the diffuse gamma - rays one has to weigh the emissivity of the sum of the gas layers with the cr density .",

    "the resulting distribution is shown by the outer dashed line .",
    "the intensity ratio r of the srcs and diffuse galactic crs from @xmath0 production was estimated by @xcite : @xmath26 where the first bracket takes into account the difference in gas densities in snrs and the galactic disc , the second bracket the limited confinement time @xmath27 of scrs in snrs and the third bracket the difference in energy dependence between the bubble template and the @xmath0 template . from figs .",
    "[ f2]b and [ f2]d one observes that this ratio becomes one for energies between 15 and 30 gev , which requires that the product of the first two brackets is of the order of 4 .",

    "this morphology is shown by the slim ( yellow ) ellipse in fig .",
    "it has a larger bar angle than the bar indicated in the background , which has @xmath34 @xcite , but this angle has a large error , since it was found from a subset of stars in the first quadrant .",

    "we interpret the combined findings as follows : supernovae explosions accelerate crs with a spectral index of 2.15 by diffusive shock wave acceleration , which in turn produce gamma - rays with such a hard spectrum as long as they are trapped in the sources ( scrs ) . in the central region ( @xmath16 ) the global thermal and cr pressure are assumed to be high enough to blow a small fraction of the gas into the halo , either from the disc @xcite or from the inner gc @xcite .",
    "this hot gas in the halo is inferred from the rosat x - ray data @xcite , which was interpreted as advection of gas from the plane with wind speeds as large as 2000 km / h @xcite .",
    "in such an advective environment the crs can be trapped inside the plasma and there is no energy - dependent escape , so the scrs will still correspond to the 1/@xmath38 spectrum at high latitudes .",
    "the spectral index of the locally observed proton spectrum is around 2.75 and the softening from 2.15 to 2.75 is attributed to diffusion , simply because high energy protons escape faster from the galaxy @xcite .",

    "the first error originates from the fit , while the second error originates from the error in the spectral index , which is the dominant systematic uncertainty because the normalisation of the bubble template is most sensitive to the high energy tail of the data , so the extrapolation to lower energies depends on the spectral index .",
