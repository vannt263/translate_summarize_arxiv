    "<S> we investigate the magnetic response in the quantum spin hall phase of the layered kane - mele model with hubbard interaction , and argue a condition to obtain the meissner effect . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of rashba spin orbit coupling is also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the kane - mele ( km ) model is proposed to describe the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) of electrons on the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that , in a certain parameter region , the meissner effect is obtained from the effective field theory of the layered km model with an electronic correlation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath0 unit and the minkovskian metric @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the essential ingredients of the km model@xcite is the intrinsic spin - orbit ( so ) coupling @xmath3 , which gives an effective magnetic field depending on spin and also an excitation gap @xmath4 to the electron@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the term yields quantization of the spin hall conductivity ( shc)@xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the interlayer distance . </S>",
    "<S> the model can also have the rashba extrinsic so coupling @xmath7 , which breaks the inversion symmetry and is induced by an electric field perpendicular to the honeycomb lattice plane . </S>",
    "<S> the term also breaks the conservation of electron spin @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath9 case , first .    </S>",
    "<S> we add the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian per layer is , @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron with spin at the @xmath14-th site and @xmath15 is the nearest neighbor hopping . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is the intrinsic so term consisting of the next nearest neighbor hopping , and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are unit vectors along the two bonds where the electron moving from site @xmath19 to @xmath14 passes . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath10 is lower than the critical value @xmath20 , above which the system tends toward the other insulating phase.@xcite namely , we consider the phase which is continuously connected to the quantum spin hall state @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss how to deal with the electron correlation @xmath10 . on - site </S>",
    "<S> coulomb repulsion can be written by the on - site spin - spin interaction ; @xmath22 the first term just gives the renormalization for the chemical potential and can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the auxiliary field @xmath23 , which is a three - component vector in the spin space , and use the stratonovich - hubbard transformation @xcite @xmath24where , @xmath25 and therefore , @xmath26 the spin - spin interaction is eliminated in appearance , but we have a coupling between @xmath23 and the electron spin , and a quadratic term of @xmath23 instead .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the continuum limit and take into account the low energy electronic excitations around @xmath27 and @xmath28 points in the brillouin zone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the electromagnetic @xmath29 gauge field @xcite @xmath30 and @xmath31 spin gauge field @xmath32 via covariant derivative , @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( the auxiliary field in the continuum limit ) and @xmath35 is a constant external field introduced artificially to estimate the spin current . </S>",
    "<S> we define a parameter @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lattice constant , and the microscopic lagrangian density is@xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the eight - component fermion field which is labeled by the eigenvalues of the diagonal components of valley spin @xmath40 , sublattice spin @xmath41 and real spin @xmath42 . @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that , except for the last term , the lagrangian ( [ microl ] ) possesses the @xmath45 local gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31 gauge symmetry is broken down to @xmath46 , since the so term contains @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation which will be shown below is quite similar to one presented in ref.@xcite , although the physical meaning of the spin gauge field is different . </S>",
    "<S> we integrate out @xmath48 and obtain the one - loop effective lagrangian for the gauge fields in the low energy and long wavelength region . </S>",
    "<S> the result is@xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for the induced part of the effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lind ] ) is the bf term@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient is the quantized shc given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ shc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that only @xmath51 couples to the electromagnetic gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> this comes from the fact that the @xmath52(2 ) symmetry is broken down to @xmath46 symmetry by the so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> maxwell term is renormalized as@xcite @xmath53 the elastic term for @xmath54 is also induced . </S>",
    "<S> we can recognize that any potential terms ( i.e. , zeroth - order terms with respect to the derivative @xmath55 ) of @xmath30 and also @xmath51 in @xmath50 are absent because of @xmath45 gauge symmetry in the fermionic part of microscopic lagrangian ( [ microl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the low energy and long wavelength physics of @xmath30 and @xmath51 is described definitely by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ leff ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the static equation of motion obtained from the lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) has been investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the argument indicates that when the dimensionless parameter satisfies @xmath56 we obtain the perfect diamagnetism as the energetically favorable solution . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we obtain @xmath57 where , @xmath58 shows the penetration depth . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain @xmath59 we can see from the bf term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lind ] ) that electric current flows perpendicular to the gradient of @xmath60 @xcite , and this current screens the applied magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> let us take into account the rashba coupling.@xcite we add @xmath61 to the microscopic lagrangian ( [ microl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the rashba term breaks @xmath46 symmetry , the symmetry - breaking terms are induced additionally in the effective lagrangian eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ leff ] ) . up to the gaussian approximation , the important alteration is the quadratic term of @xmath62 ; @xmath63 where @xcite @xmath64 eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ replace ] ) indicates that the parameter @xmath65 is renormalized as @xmath66 the other parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ leff ] ) also receive renormalization of the order @xmath70@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the essential point is that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ condition ] ) , which is the condition for the meissner effect , is changed as ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ replace2 ] ) ) @xmath71 compared with the condition ( [ condition ] ) , eq . ( [ condition2 ] ) becomes more attainable . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 is positive and proportional to @xmath73 , which can be changed by the electric field perpendicular to the two - dimensional plane .    </S>",
