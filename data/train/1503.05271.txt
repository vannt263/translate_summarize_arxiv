    "the booming of bandwidth - intensive mobile applications and ever growing mobile user number have brought great challenges for today s mobile cloud systems  @xcite .",
    "one of the performance bottlenecks lies in the fact that most current mobile cloud systems are highly centralized .",
    "the fast growing of mobile cloud computing business is calling for geographically distributed cloud infrastructures , i.e. , federated data centers ( dcs )  @xcite , to relieve the heavy load of the central server and improve user experience .    except the specialized cloud providers like google ,",
    "the evolution of mobile network architecture has promoted the decentralization of cloud systems as well . toward the fifth generation ( 5 g )",
    "@xcite of wireless broadband , emerging paradigms such as network function virtualization ( nfv )  @xcite can help to realize a flat and intelligent mobile network embraced with cloud technology .",
    "for example , in a mobile system adopted the concept of c - ran  @xcite , scattered cloud resource blocks within a certain geographical area can be aggregate into a virtual cloud resource pool .",
    "federated resource pools in multiple geographical areas can thus form a distributed cloud system .",
    "the follow me cloud ( fmc ) concept , which enables service migration across federated dcs following the mobility of mobile terminals ( mts ) , is widely accepted in distributed cloud systems  @xcite . enjoying service from the geographically nearest dc",
    "can always get a pleasant user experience since a local dc can minimize the end - to - end delay between mts and cloud servers . in this paper , a geographically distributed cloud system which adopt the fmc concept is considered .",
    "multiple dcs take charge of respective service areas and each dc is equipped with a resource manager ( rm ) .",
    "a mt can initiate a new request ( nr ) to the local dc in its resident service area .",
    "when the mt wanders to another service area during service period , a service migration request ( mr ) will be send to the destination dc .",
    "the corresponding rm then makes a trade off between the user perceived quality and incurred system cost to decide whether the service should be migrated .",
    "rms also make decisions on how much resources should be allocated to each accepted service request ( nr or mr ) .",
    "the resource management problem described previously is formulated as an constrained semi - markov decision process ( smdp ) .",
    "our work is inspired by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "authors in  @xcite introduce an analytical model for fmc concept and in  @xcite , the service migration procedure is modeled using mdp .",
    "other relevant works on service migration in cloud systems include  @xcite ,  @xcite , etc . in these previous works ,",
    "the service model is described from the perspective of mts , and the resource allocation problem is not considered . in our work , the decision making approach is described from the perspective of the overall system , and the objective is to improve the overall system utility . to solve the smdp ,",
    "the value iteration algorithm and q - learning algorithm are employed to obtain the optimal policy .",
    "compared with other schemes , the smdp - based resource management scheme can significantly increase the average system reward and reduce the rejection probability of service requests .",

    "we consider a typical 3gpp cellular network covered by heterogeneous wireless access nodes , e.g. , macro base station ( bs ) , femtocell node  @xcite , wlan access point , etc .",

    "when the mt enters the coverage area of a bs , it enters the service area of the attached dc equivalently .",
    "each dc has a resource pool which contains @xmath0 units of resources .",
    "mts are offered resources ( computation or storage ) represented in the form of virtual machines ( vms ) .",
    "after a service request is accepted , a guest vm is constructed in the dc and the rm will allocate resources to the vm for running the service .    when a mt moves from one service area to another during service period , a service mr will be sent to the destination dc . if the mr is accepted , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fmc1 ] , the corresponding vm in the original dc will be released and a new vm will be constructed in the destination dc . during migration process , service data in the original vm needs to be transmitted to the new vm via backhaul .",
    "another case is that the mr is rejected , as fig .",
    "[ fmc2 ] shows , the vm in the original dc will be maintained and the mt will receive service via an additional wired link between the serving dc and the current connected base station .",
