    "the global topology of spacetime , which is not fixed by the equations of general relativity , plays an important role in quantum field theory even in a flat spacetime .",
    "when a spacetime is multiply connected only those modes of a field that satisfy boundary conditions determined by the topology of the spacetime are relevant in the calculation of locally measurable quantities such as the stress - energy tensor @xmath5 .",
    "for example , in a cylindrical two dimensional spacetime , @xmath6 , the only allowed momentum is an integer multiple of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the circumference in the closed spatial direction .",
    "dewitt , hart , and isham @xcite thoroughly studied the effects of multiple connectedness of the spacetime manifold ( called mbiosity ) , twisting of the field , and orientability of manifold on @xmath4 for a massless scalar field in various topological spaces . in this paper",
    "we extend their work to an untwisted massive scalar field .",
    "we evaluate @xmath0 in four dimensional spacetime manifolds of the type @xmath9 where @xmath10 can be either @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , the mbius strip @xmath14 , or the klein bottle @xmath15 .",
    "both the mbius strip and the klein bottle are examples of nonorientable manifolds .",
    "another issue addressed in this paper is the effect of field mass on chronology protection . in previous papers @xcite",
    "it has been shown that @xmath4 for a massless scalar field diverges on a chronology horizon in various spacetimes with closed timelike curves ( ctc s ) .",
    "the backreaction of the metric to this diverging stress - energy through the einstein field equations may be able to prevent formation of ctc s .",
    "however , boulware s work indicates that @xmath4 for a massive scalar field remains finite on the chronology horizon in gott space @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed boulware s result in grant space which is holonomic to gott space @xcite and found that @xmath16 is finite on the chronology horizon provided the mass of the scalar field is above a lower limit which depends on the topological identification scale lengths of the spacetime .    in sec .",
    "ii a general procedure for using point - splitting regularization to calculate the vacuum expectation value of @xmath5 for a free massive scalar field in a flat but multiply connected spacetime is described .",
    "we then apply this method to spacetimes without ctc s in sec .",
    "iii and to those with ctc s in sec .  iv . throughout our calculations natural units in which @xmath17 are used and the metric signature is @xmath18 .",
    "our calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the stress - energy tensor is greatly simplified by the facts that all curvature components vanish in a flat spacetime and that we do not need to deal with renormalization of the field mass @xmath20 and curvature coupling constant @xmath21 arising from interactions .",
    "however , we do have to worry about the topology of the spacetime manifold since it may allow two points on the manifold to be connected by multiple geodesics . in this paper the minkowski vacuum state",
    "is assumed to be the default vacuum state in all spacetimes considered .",
    "this assumption is defended later by an argument based on a particle detector carried by a geodesic observer .",
    "point - splitting regularization ( or the `` method of images '' ) is used to take multiple connectedness into account .",
    "the differences in topology of the spacetimes will appear only in the geodesic distances between image charges and in the number of geodesics connecting the points .",
    "once geodesical distances for a particular topology are found the calculation of @xmath19 reduces to simple differentiation of the hadamard elementary function and taking the coincidence limit .",
    "the stress - energy tensor @xmath5 is formally defined as a variation of the action with respect to the metric . in a flat four dimensional spacetime the stress - energy tensor for a general free scalar field is given by @xmath22 note that @xmath4 depends upon the value of @xmath21 even when the curvature vanishes .",
    "for conformal coupling @xmath23 ; for minimal coupling @xmath24 .",
    "we will allow arbitrary values of @xmath21 to make our results as general as possible .",
    "the scalar field @xmath25 satisfies the klein - gordon equation @xmath26 .",
    "since every term in @xmath5 is quadratic in the field variable @xmath27 , we can split the point @xmath28 into @xmath28 and @xmath29 and take the coincidence limit as @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31\\left\\{\\phi(x ) ,          \\phi(\\tilde{x})\\right\\ } ,      \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the anticommutator of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "covariant derivatives @xmath35 and @xmath36 are to be applied with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we have also symmetrized @xmath5 over @xmath27 and @xmath37 . before taking the vacuum expectation value of @xmath5",
    "we need to define the vacuum state of the spacetimes .",
    "this is nontrivial because some spacetimes lack a global timelike killing vector field , which is required to define positive frequency .",
    "the spacetimes we will consider may all be constructed by making topological identifications of minkowski space , with coordinates and metric given by @xmath38 in the case of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , the mbius strip and the klein bottle spacetimes , there exists a global timelike killing vector field ( i.  e. , @xmath39 ) and so does a natural vacuum state . the effect of multiple connectedness on the field is only making it periodic in closed spatial directions .",
    "also , it allows the field to be twisted , and we will briefly comment of the effect of twisting and the vacuum energy density in the next section . since each section of these spacetimes between the boundaries is identical to a portion of minkowski space , we can assume the default vacuum states of these spacetimes to be identical to that of ordinary minkowski space .    as an example of a spacetime with no natural vacuum state , we will consider grant space in sec .",
    "although grant space does have local timelike killing vector fields everywhere , they can not be patched together to form a global timelike killing vector field @xcite .",
    "however , each section of the spacetime is identical to minkowski space , and a geodesic observer will not detect any particles if the spacetime is in the minkowski vacuum state .",
    "hence , we can also use the minkowski vacuum state for the grant space .    the vacuum expectation value of stress - energy tensor is now given by sandwiching both sides of eq .",

    "since the path circling around @xmath52 times can not be deformed continuously into the one which circles around @xmath53 ) times , all inequivalent paths must be taken into account .",
    "equivalently we can consider this situation as an electrostatic problem and use the method of images .",

    "the contribution to @xmath74 from the @xmath52th image charge for @xmath141 is proportional to @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "the factor of @xmath143 comes from the doppler shift as the particle is boosted in the @xmath125 direction @xmath52 times . in misner space this factor causes @xmath4 to diverge on the chronology horizon , and it might prevent the formation of ctc s .",
    "however , in grant space the exponentially decaying factor @xmath144 , which comes from the nonvanishing geodesical distances between image charges in the @xmath126 direction @xmath79 , makes @xmath16 finite for values of @xmath145 .",
    "this result agrees with boulware s similar calculation in gott space @xcite .",
    "this result implies that the metric backreaction may not be large enough to significantly change the grant space geometry if the field mass is sufficiently large .",
    "in calculating the vacuum expectation value of the stress - energy tensor for a massive scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling in multiply connected flat spacetimes , we have shown that a nonzero field mass raises the value of the energy density ( decreasing its magnitude ) and confirmed that increased mbiosity lowers the energy density .",
    "the introduction of nonorientability can evidently either increase the magnitude of the energy density ( mbius band ) or decrease it ( klein bottle ) .",
    "another effect on the stress - energy that we have not examined yet is self - interaction ( e.  g. , @xmath146 theory ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath4 for a self - interacting field is much more complicated than that for a free field since it requires renormalization of quantities such as the field mass , which will be dependent on the field @xmath25 , the curvature coupling constant @xmath21 , and the field coupling constant @xmath147 . in spacetimes with relatively simple topology , such as @xmath89 and casimir - type spacetime ,",
    "@xmath4 has been calculated by birrell and ford , ford , ford and yoshimura , kay , and toms @xcite . in a spacetime with ctc s self - interaction",
    "is known to cause failure of unitarity @xcite .    in grant space",
    "we discovered that the divergence of @xmath16 on the chronology horizon depends on relative size of the field mass to the ratio of the periodicities .",
    "this result may have significant consequences for chronology protection .",
    "it suggests that the metric backreaction from the stress - energy of a massive quantized field will likely not be large enough to significantly alter the geometry and prevent the formation of ctc s .",
    "if quantized matter fields are to provide the chronology protection mechanism , our result would indicate that only massless fields may be capable of providing a sufficiently strong backreaction to prevent the formation of ctc s . outside the domain of quantum gravity , this would place a heavy responsibility on the electromagnetic field ( and conceivably neutrino fields , should any be massless ) as the sole protector of chronology .",
