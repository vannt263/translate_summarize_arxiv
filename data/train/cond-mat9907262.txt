    "the systematic study of random tilings arose from the insight that they may serve as models for entropically stabilized quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "as such , they are an important and interesting alternative to the perfect tilings based upon the projection method .",
    "although random tilings were used intensively to study transport properties and dynamical properties of real quasicrystals , not much effort was spent to deduce random tiling properties from general grounds @xcite .",
    "we mention the two random tiling hypotheses stated by henley in 1991 , which serve as a starting point to infer diffraction properties , using ideas of the landau theory of phase transitions . recently",
    ", a more general approach was investigated @xcite , mainly for two reasons : on the one hand , the concept of entropic stabilization applies also to crystalline solids which therefore should be included in a more general description .",
    "on the other hand , the quasicrystalline random tilings share a special feature which stems from the fact that these tilings are derived from the perfect ones : they have a height representation  each tiling can be embedded as a surface in a higherdimensional space . since tiling surfaces with equal ( mean ) density of prototiles have equal ( mean ) slope ,",
    "the slope parameters can be used to describe the random tiling ensemble .",
    "this is the so - called _ phason strain _ parametrization which governs the conventional description .",
    "this description has a number of shortcomings : first of all , it only allows the description of those random tilings which do allow a height representation  being the vanishing ( though interesting ) minority of all possible tilings .",
    "second , symmetry analysis in this framework is constrained to _ geometric _ symmetries , whereas there may be other relevant symmetries of the tiling ensemble .",
    "an example are colour symmetries modelling chemical disorder , which is shown to play an important role for real quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "third , it was expected that a more general analysis could also clarify the origin of the random tiling hypotheses mentioned above .",
    "this was the viewpoint which led to the random tiling description proposed in @xcite .",
    "there , the grand - canonical tiling ensemble was considered where prototiles are energetically degenerate , and the chemical potentials of the different prototiles or their ( mean ) densities are the only macroscopic parameters . it was explained how to perform a symmetry analysis in this framework .",
    "this led to a proof of a generalization of the first random tiling hypothesis which asserts that the point of maximum entropy is a point of maximum symmetry .",
    "in addition , the range of validity of the second hypothesis could be analyzed using the grand - canonical setup , and an exactly solved ( crystallographic ) counterexample could be given .",
    "a rigorous treatment of diffraction is also possible using this setup @xcite .",
    "the examples presented so far were taken only from the crystallographic case .",
    "it remained to apply the proposed description scheme to quasicrystallographic random tilings and to show the consistency of the two approaches .",
    "this is where this paper aims at : the next two chapters are devoted to the description of two important examples of quasicrystallogrphic random tilings , the ammann - beenker tiling @xcite and the square - triangle tiling @xcite .",
    "we perform a symmetry analysis along the lines of @xcite and compare the approach with the conventional one , thereby showing the consistency of the two approaches . in the appendix ,",
    "we shortly review and clarify the conventional description .",
    "we analyze the connection between maximal symmetry and vanishing phason strain and derive a group theoretic criterion .",
    "if the criterion is valid  which is the case in all examples we met  the first random tiling hypothesis is fulfilled in its original formulation : the point of maximum entropy is a point of maximum symmetry @xcite , and maximum symmetry in turn implies vanishing phason strain .",
    "a comparing discussion of the two approaches concludes the paper .",
    "the prototiles of the ammann - beenker random tiling are two squares and four @xmath0-rhombi as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ammtiles ] .",
    "there is no further matching rule apart from the face - to - face tiling condition , which imposes the relation @xmath1 on the prototile densities .",
    "tilings can alternatively be viewed as world lines of particles of two different kinds , as is indicated by the decoration .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there is a nonlinear constraint among the different prototile densities which reduces the number of independent variables to four .",
    "this constraint was obtained using the height representation of this model , which is given below .",
    "it should be noted that it can be independently derived relating the tile description to the line interpretation .",
    "this method was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the constraint reads _ 1 _ 2 = 2 ( _ 1_3+_2_4 ) .",
    "the derivation imposes periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is highly plausible that the constraint holds ( asymptotically ) also in the case of free boundary conditions , though there is no proof of this assumption .",
    "complementary , the line representation suggests four independent parameters since it is possible to fix the densities of different lines as well as their mean direction independently .",
    "moreover , care has to be taken in choosing a set of independent parameters : the four rhombi densities , for example , allow the determination of the square densities only up to a permutation , due to the nonlinear constraint .",
    "this subtlety does not arise if , for example , three rhombi densities and one square density are chosen .",
    "the quadratic invariants given below are insensitive to this because only absolute values of square density differences occur .    at the point of maximum symmetry",
    ", the four rhombi densities and the two square densities have the same value .",
    "the nonlinear constraint fixes them to _ i=1/4 , _ i=1/8 .",
    "this is the point where the squares and the rhombi each occupy half of the tiled area .",
    "we determine the second order expansion of the entropy density according to @xmath2-symmetry .",
    "we introduce reduced prototile densities r_i=_i-1/4 , s_i=_i-1/8 , such that the point of maximum symmetry is the origin .",
    "the vector space relevant for the symmetry analysis is obtained through _ linearization _ of the constraints .",
    "it is four - dimensional and determined by r_1+r_2=0 , s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4=0 .",
