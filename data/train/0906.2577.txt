    "@xcite has been in operation for more than six years and has discovered a large number of new hard x - ray sources at energies @xmath020  kev .",
    "this bandpass is above the range where most types of sources can emit thermal blackbody radiation .",
    "thus , _ integral _ provides a window on the non - thermal emission that comes from galactic sources ( e.g. , accreting black holes , neutron stars , and magnetized white dwarfs ) as well as extragalactic active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . with large field - of - view ( fov ) coded aperture mask instruments ( e.g. , a @xmath1 partially coded fov for ibis , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , _ integral _ has observed most of the sky thus far during its mission , but its sky coverage has not been uniform , with more time being concentrated near the galactic plane . while ibis has provided a step forward in hard x - ray angular resolution , it localizes 2040  kev sources to 15@xmath2 , which is normally not sufficient to identify an optical or infrared counterpart , leaving the nature of many of the sources uncertain .",
    "thus , throughout the _ integral _ mission , follow - up observations have been made with soft x - ray ( @xmath30.510 kev ) telescopes ( _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _ ) to localize the _ integral _ sources and determine their nature .    as of 2009 march ,",
    "_ integral _ had detected nearly 600 sources , and 242 of these are igr sourcesrodrigue / html / igrsources.html for a continually updated list of igr sources .",

    "integral _ or not previously detected in the @xmath320100  kev band ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more on the criterion for the igr classification ) .",
    "the source types of the 242 igr sources are dominated by 79 agn ( 73 with firm identifications ) , 67 x - ray binaries ( 47 with firm identifications ) , and 15 cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "there are small numbers of igr sources in a few other categories ( symbiotic stars , active stars , an anomalous x - ray pulsar , and a supernova remnant ) , and the remaining 72 igr sources are unclassified . along with the soft x - ray localizations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the steady increase in the numbers of classified igr sources depends on ground - based optical and ir follow - up observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are key to obtaining firm identifications .",
    "one of the most interesting categories of igr sources are the high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , for which _ integral _ has uncovered two new ( and not entirely independent ) classes : the obscured hmxbs @xcite and the supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the obscured hmxbs have large and , in some cases , variable levels of intrinsic ( i.e. , local ) absorption with @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "there is evidence in several cases that a strong stellar equatorial outflow is responsible for the absorption , including the detection of p  cygni profiles @xcite , providing direct evidence for a wind , as well as excess emission in the mid - infrared @xcite .",
    "the strong winds and high absorption explain why _ integral _ s hard x - ray imaging was necessary to detect these sources , and it has been suggested that these obscured hmxbs are in a previously unstudied phase of hmxb evolution @xcite . with the discovery of sfxts ,",
    "_ integral _ found a new type of hmxb behavior where sources undergo high - amplitude ( orders of magnitude ) hard x - ray flares that only last for time scales of hours @xcite . in part , this is thought to be caused by clumps in the supergiant stellar winds @xcite , but it may also be related to the interaction between the wind and a strong neutron star magnetic field @xcite .    to identify the nature of more of these sources",
    ", we have been using _",
    "chandra _ to study the unclassified igr sources near the galactic plane .",
    "the primary purpose of the observations is to localize the sources to allow for optical or ir follow - up . while x - ray positions with an accuracy of several arcseconds ( as can be given by _ swift _ or _ xmm - newton",
    "_ ) can lead to correct optical or ir identifications , in many cases ( and especially in the crowded regions of the galactic plane ) , the sub - arcsecond _ chandra _ positions are crucial for obtaining definitive identifications .",
    "a second important use for the _ chandra _ observations is to measure the soft x - ray energy spectrum , providing information about source hardness and levels of absorption that help to determine the nature of the source .",
    "our _ chandra _ program began in 2005 with the identification of 4 igr sources @xcite , and we subsequently used _",
    "observations taken between 2007 and 2008 to obtain identifications for 12 more igr sources @xcite . in this work , we report on 22 _ chandra _ observations taken during _ chandra _ s 9th observing cycle between late-2007 and early-2009 .",
    "for _ chandra _ follow - up observations , we chose sources from the 27th _ integral _ general reference catalog that were detected in the 2040 kev band as of 2007 march .",
    "the list that we produced includes igr sources within @xmath6 of the galactic plane , and we used information from @xcite and @xcite to select sources that were not known to be transient and whose nature was unknown at the time . ultimately , we chose the 22 sources listed in table  [ tab : obs ] for @xmath35  ks `` snapshot '' observations with _",

    "the position of cxou j174026.8365537 is consistent with the x - ray binary , confirming the identification .",

    "although we can not say definitively what the nature of the source is , the result that there is a high level of interstellar absorption also indicates that the source is distant , possibly close to the galactic center region at @xmath38.5  kpc .",
