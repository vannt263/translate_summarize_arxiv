    "in maximal supergravity , one remaining question concerns the behaviour of amplitude diagrams , especially as to the finiteness of the theory . while maximally supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory ( sym ) @xcite has proven to be perturbatively finite in four dimensions @xcite , a corresponding statement is not available for supergravity  it is still unknown whether or not @xmath3 supergravity @xcite ( the dimensional reduction of @xmath0 supergravity @xcite ) is perturbatively finite , or where in perturbation theory the first divergences may set in . the general conditions on the formulation in order for it to be finite",
    "still have to be shown .",
    "the prevalent opinion seems to be that supergravity on its own it not a sensible quantum theory , and that the ultraviolet completion is string theory or m - theory , although there are dissenting views ( see e.g. ref .",
    "it is often assumed that the 4-point amplitude has a divergence at 7 loops @xcite .",
    "the techniques for determining the properties above typically make use of maximally supersymmetric quantum field theories , which have been of considerable interest lately",
    ". however , the low energy limit of m - theory , maximal supergravity , appears to diverge in the ultraviolet limit for @xmath4 @xcite , though explicit calculations for the four - graviton amplitude in four dimensions ( @xmath3 ) show no divergences up to four loops @xcite , which is as far as detailed examinations have been conducted , so far .",
    "this latter procedure is complicated and time consuming , which is why it is interesting to explore alternative descriptions .",
    "one such is to use pure spinors as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the pure spinor formalism has been of use in maximally supersymmetric theories and string theory for some time , its main advantage being the fact that it provides a way of having manifest supersymmetry present . in a maximally supersymmetric model ,",
    "the ordinary construction in terms of superfields works differently than in less supersymmetric situations , in that supersymmetry transformations close under commutation only modulo equations of motion .",
    "this means that the supermultiplets are representations of supersymmetry only on - shell , and there is no way of formulating an action principle with these superfields only , since they do not provide auxiliary fields for off - shell supersymmetry .",
    "pure spinor superfield theory provides a way to encode the traditional superspace constraints , leading to the on - shell multiplets , as equations of motion .",
    "this requires the introduction of new bosonic variables , the pure spinors .",
    "it was first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that a certain representation of the lorentz group was needed in order to lift the equations of motion of @xmath5 sym , and that this representation could be associated with pure spinors .",
    "other early works @xcite noted a connection between supersymmetry and pure spinors , both for gauge theory and supergravity .",
    "the breakthrough came with the realisation by berkovits that the long sought for covariant quantisation of manifestly supersymmetric superstring ( or superparticle ) theory could be achieved using a set of variables that indeed are pure spinors @xcite .",
    "independently of this advance , in connection to the search for higher - derivative deformations of maximally supersymmetric models @xcite , it was realised that the on - shell property could be understood in terms of cohomology @xcite .",
    "the ensuing field  antifield structure of maximally supersymmetric field theory has been investigated and actions have been given for virtually all models that do not involve self - dual fields @xcite , including supergravity .",
    "a generic feature of interactions in pure spinor field theory is that the maximal order of the interaction terms is lower than in a component formulation . in supergravity",
    ", this even makes the interactions polynomial @xcite , a phenomenon which has also been observed for the abelian born  infeld theory @xcite . having a full interacting field theory with a limited number of interaction terms is a great advantage when it comes to perturbation theory , which we will use in the present paper .",
    "it indeed gives a more direct explanation of many of the properties of amplitudes @xcite that are difficult to discern from a component action .",
    "previous approaches to perturbation theory using pure spinors , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , have relied on first quantisation , a construction of a description with pure spinors through comparisons with string theory .",
    "in such a formulation , the consistency of every vertex ( and eventually the amplitudes ) with respect to the symmetries of the theory must be checked , something which the consistency of the classical action takes care of in a field theory .",
    "we have been much inspired by the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , and indeed use similar techniques in the concrete calculations . the use of @xmath5 pure spinors for amplitude calculations in refs . , with its separation of left- and right - movers is probably the ideal realisation of the kawai",
    " lewellen ",
    "tye relations @xcite , but does not allow for a field theory formulation , in contrast to the @xmath0 pure spinors used here , which only calls for a single brst operator .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in order to apply the pure spinor formalism of @xmath0 supergravity to the construction of amplitude diagrams , we begin by going through the key concepts of the pure spinor formalism in relation to supergravity in section [ sec.char ] . these are generally well known , but crucial for the subsequent part , section 3 , where we address the question of how to describe amplitude diagrams , both tree diagrams and loop diagrams .",
    "the main ingredients for the construction of amplitudes are either given by the action , or by quite straightforward generalisations to @xmath0 pure spinors of techniques known from @xmath5 .",
    "the last part of the amplitude description though , consists of the analysis of the detailed properties of loop amplitudes .",
    "these are intricate , but of great use in section [ sec.uv ] , the part on the uv behaviour of the amplitude diagrams . despite the different formalism ,",
    "our final results are in complete agreement with those of refs .",
    "however , our analysis might not be exhaustive , and might give at hand more properties , not yet noted , despite the intricateness of the description , as is noted in section [ sec.con ] , where our results are summarised and discussed .",
    "a few useful spinor identities are listed in appendix [ app.fierz ] , the zero - mode cohomology of the pure spinor superfield is given in appendix [ app.zmc ] and appendix [ app.pro ] contains a derivation necessary for the standard procedure of general regularisation of amplitude diagrams to be applicable to supergravity .",
    "the advantage of the pure spinor formalism is that it provides an off - shell formulation for maximally supersymmetric theories .",
    "typically the fields depend not only on the ordinary superspace coordinates , but also on a bosonic spinor @xmath6 which is pure in the sense that it obeys the constraint @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for the introduction of the pure spinor @xmath6 is that the equations of motion for the physical fields of a free , maximally supersymmetric theory tend to follow a pattern which is reproduced by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the covariant fermionic derivative , acting on a pure spinor superfield @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 here is a superfield of the original theory , dependent only on the superspace coordinates , which contains all the physical fields of the theory .",
    "the parts of @xmath12 which vanish due to the pure spinor constraint correspond exactly to the terms which are absent in the original equations of motion is the part of the superspace 3-form with only fermionic indices . ] .",
    "the linearised dynamics of the original ( free ) theory is captured in full by one singe equation of motion of the free enlarged theory : @xmath13 .    in @xmath0 supergravity",
    ", this construction appears as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the difference from the original theory is the presence of the pure spinor , which is endowed with ghost number 1 in order to separate physical fields and variables from the original theory ( with ghost number zero ) from other components of the enlarged theory . to be precise ,",
    "these contain the set of ghosts and antifields appropriate for the theory , with the correct ghost numbers .",
    "the general field @xmath15 ( the only field present ) is fermionic , with ghost number 3 and no free indices , and has as its @xmath16- and @xmath17-independent part the ghost for ghost for ghost of the tensor gauge symmetry .",
    "it includes , in addition to the unconstrained superfield @xmath18 of ghost number zero , also superfields containing the relevant ghosts and antifields of the theory ( and more ) .    in short",
    ", @xmath19 can be recognised as a nilpotent operator , and the cohomology of @xmath19 represents the free on - shell fields , including ghosts and antifields .",
    "the actual field content can be read off in table [ table.cpsi ] in appendix [ app.zmc ] . there , the lorentz representations of the zero - mode cohomology of @xmath19 is given .",
    "the proper cohomology of @xmath19 contains these fields , constrained by some differential equation ( equation of motion ) which also is in the zero - mode cohomology . through a separation of terms of ghost number zero from the rest ,",
    "the enlarged theory gives at hand results in the original theory .",
    "at the same time , the presence of @xmath19 enables off - shell calculations .",
    "the details of this  the main concepts of the formalism  is what we will begin by describing , below , before dealing with the details of the formalism .    in the end ,",
    "the full action of @xmath0 supergravity contains more than the kinetic operator @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to the term of the free theory , describing the free propagation of a field , it contains a 3-point and a 4-point coupling , depends on the normalisation of @xmath20 . for canonically normalised fields",
    ", it will appear in the interaction terms instead . ] : @xcite @xmath21\\big(\\frac{1}{2}\\psi q\\psi + \\frac{1}{6}({\\lambda}{\\gamma}_{ab}{\\lambda})(1-\\frac{3}{2}t\\psi)\\psi r^a\\psi r^b\\psi\\ ] ] the precise meaning of the operators involved , as well as the integration measure , will be elucidated later in this section .",
    "importantly , the pure spinor formalism transforms the supergravity action into a polynomial expression .",
    "the quartic term is the last term and moreover , the operator @xmath22 is nilpotent so that a 4-point vertex at most can appear once in a diagram",
    ". however , though the pure spinor formalism simplifies the interaction terms in such a way , some parts remain complicated .",
    "for example , it is not known how to write down a solution for @xmath20 .",
    "although the formulation enjoys the full gauge symmetry of @xmath0 supergravity ( diffeomorphisms , local symmetry and tensor gauge symmetry ) , the geometrical picture is obscured , as is the background invariance . in a way , the complications have only been transferred between different parts of the theory .",
    "for perturbative theory though , the action above is ideal .",
    "the parts of this action is what will be described below , after the main concepts have been presented . to begin with ,",
    "we discuss the formalism with respect to what variables there are , including a discussion on what the pure spinor really is : the solution to the pure spinor constraint .",
    "notably , the action is expressed in the so called non - minimal formalism , which is what is usually used for the pure spinor formalism , since the introduction of two more sets of variables ( apart from the pure spinor mentioned above ) enables integration .",
    "the introduction of the concept of integration , and the ensuing clarification of the importance of the non - minimal formalism , is what is described right after the non - minimal superspace .",
    "the final part of the formalism we present , before heading off for new theoretical aspects concerning the construction of amplitude diagrams , is the operators involved in the action .",
    "it should be noted that ( most ) concepts in this section are well known , though the treatment of the solution to the pure spinor constraint in this formalism , see subsection [ subsub.sol ] , only has been presented to linearised order in @xmath23 before @xcite . here , it will be treated in full .",
    "the identification of the @xmath19 described above is performed in a very ad hoc manner .",
    "however , the theory it gives rise to is very well defined . as the covariant derivative @xmath9 obeys @xmath24 in flat space and similar relations for the superspace torsion and curvature , annihilated by the pure spinor condition , hold for other backgrounds , @xmath19 can be recognised as a nilpotent operator , a brst operator .",
    "this operator is not a supersymmetry transformation operator , but commutes with all flat superspace killing spinors so that the global supersymmetry transformations close both on- and off - shell .",
    "essentially , the action is recognised to give at hand a theory with the correct properties , so that it represents a working action for the free theory .",
    "it has to be remembered , though , that ghosts and antifields are included , and need to be treated properly by gauge fixing .",
    "the brst construction concerns free theories , but it has a natural extension to a theory of interactions , a field theory formulation : the batalin - vilkovisky ( bv ) formalism @xcite . there",
    ", the brst symmetry is central , but while the brst formulation can be compared to a first quantised theory , the bv represents a second quantised version ( a field theory ) , a change which usually requires the introduction of new fields ( ghosts and antifields ) .",
    "the alteration corresponds to exchanging the brst symmetry , where @xmath19 gives rise to the variations , for the bv symmetry , where the generalised action gives rise to the variations of the fields : @xmath25 .",
    "this antibracket usually is expressed in the introduced fields and antifields .",
    "however , all those fields are already present in the field @xmath20 , which is its own antifield , so for the pure spinor formalism , the extension to a bv formalism is performed through another ad hoc recognition of how to imitate the bv formalism .",
    "the only antibracket possible to write down , where the field @xmath20 is self - conjugate with respect to the antibracket , is : @xmath26\\ ] ] this simple construction turns out to be the correct one , which can be checked on the component fields appearing in the cohomology listed in appendix [ app.zmc ] .",
    "this concludes the recognition of what the pure spinor formalism really is .",
    "the expression for the equation of motion for a field @xmath20 is : @xmath27 if a pure spinor superfield @xmath20 fulfils this equation , and thus obeys the equation of motion , it is termed to be on - shell .",
    "gauge invariance for a field is represented by the exact same expression , as is typical in a bv formalism .",
    "furthermore , the master equation which the action must obey is @xmath28 which also gives at hand the form of the action once the 3-point coupling has been deduced from certain properties of the theory , a process which will be described below .",
    "most importantly , the bv formalism makes it possible to perform off - shell calculations .",
    "it incorporates the alterations that are necessary in order to bring the original on - shell theory off - shell , where interactions can be taken into account in a manifestly supersymmetric formalism .",
    "the bv formalism incorporates far more than the brst version through the change of the symmetry transformations .",
    "there are many off - shell field components that take part in the interactions , at the same time as the free physical fields can be expressed in the minimal formalism and interpreted with respect to the original theory .",
    "furthermore , gauge symmetry is manifest throughout the process , just as for the sym theory , so at the point when the gauge needs to be fixed , no extra procedure is necessary in order to check gauge invariance , which is always present .",
    "these are considerable strengths of the formalism .      in @xmath0 , the coordinates which describe superspace consist of 11 bosonic variables ( @xmath29 ) and 32 fermionic spinors ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "they are symplectic , so @xmath31 , as they are connected by the asymmetric tensor , have a look at appendix [ app.fierz ] . ]",
    "furthermore , the dimension of a variable @xmath33 is usually set to @xmath34 , so that the corresponding for a spinor coordinate is @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , in the pure spinor formalism there is the pure spinor @xmath36 , which is bosonic and has 9 degrees of freedom less than ordinary spinors due to the pure spinor condition , i.e. , 23 independent ones with @xmath37 , although it clearly differs from the traditional mathematical definition , which only makes sense in an even number of dimensions . ] . in the non - minimal formalism",
    "there are also two other variables , introduced due to their properties : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the first of these is bosonic with ghost number @xmath34 , whereas the second is fermionic with ghost number zero , and they obey @xmath40 .",
    "both are of dimension @xmath41 , so that the set @xmath42 has quantum numbers conjugate to those of @xmath43 . note that at the introduction of the non - minimal variables , the brst operator has to be modified in order for the cohomology not to be changed , see subsection [ subsub.q ] .    before moving on to the finer points of the theory ,",
    "a brief explanation of notation is convenient as well . to begin with",
    ", the derivative of @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath44 . the corresponding for @xmath38 is @xmath45 , which illustrates an analogy with barred and unbarred quantities which is used throughout this paper .",
    "the derivative with respect to @xmath39 on the other hand , is denoted by @xmath46 . moreover , all expressions must be gauge invariant , which is why all these derivatives invariably show up in the combinations of @xcite : @xmath47 further notation consists of the two scalars possible to form from the pure spinors in the non - minimal formalism @xcite : @xmath48 the last is not to confuse with @xmath49 , which simply lowers or raises indices .      to wrap up the properties of @xmath0 superspace and the pure spinor constraint",
    ", we now turn to the solution of that same constraint . the procedure for finding out that the pure spinor has 23 degrees of freedom goes as follows .",
    "a spinor in @xmath0 decomposes as @xmath50 when @xmath51 , and thus becomes @xmath52 under the further decomposition @xmath53 .",
    "such a spinor contains all forms : @xmath54 some of these will be determined entirely by the pure spinor condition , a condition which however looks a bit different in this notation .",
    "the 10-dimensional @xmath55-matrices act as is a 1-form and @xmath56 represents the contraction with the vector field @xmath57 , reducing the form degree of the form it acts on by one . ]",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath56 and in addition to those , there is the @xmath59 , @xmath60 being the form degree . in total , the @xmath61-invariant symplectic spinor scalar product is : @xmath62 with this , the pure spinor constraint translates into : @xmath63 as @xmath64 is just a scalar factor and the wedge product is symmetric for @xmath65 , whereas the opposite is true in between @xmath66 s , the first and second equation can be used to solve for @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively , in terms of the other @xmath69 s : @xmath70 the last condition on the other hand , the third of the equations in eq . , corresponds to : @xmath71 here , we have rearranged the expression in order to make the solution visibly clearer .",
    "its solution contains a 3-form @xmath23 : @xmath72 this means that the pure spinor is described in full by @xmath64 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath23 , where the condition on @xmath23 needs to be examined further .",
    "the solutions for @xmath23 describe , modulo a scale , the grassmannian @xmath75 of 2-planes in @xmath76 .",
    "the 16-parameter solution with @xmath77 is the space @xmath78 of 12-dimensional pure spinors , and the full solution is a bundle over that space with fibre @xmath79 . for a parametrisation of the solutions , we break @xmath80 , so that @xmath23 splits into @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the form degrees are with respect to the @xmath84 and @xmath85 parts , respectively .",
    "their charges under the `` new '' @xmath86 are @xmath34 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , set by the assignment of the charge @xmath89 to an @xmath84 vector and the charge @xmath90 to an @xmath85 vector .",
    "furthermore , it turns out to be convenient to dualise the @xmath84 form indices to vector indices : @xmath91 in order to use this though , we need to relate wedge products of 1-forms with forms to contractions of 1-forms with the dual multi - vector , and correspondingly for contractions with vectors . for a general dimension @xmath92 and",
    "form degree @xmath60 we have @xmath93 where wedge products between vectors are defined just as between forms .",
    "we also need the general relation between scalars : @xmath94    now , the constraint in eq .",
    "splits into two sets of equations , since the vector @xmath57 decomposes in @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the one containing @xmath95 is : @xmath97 the solution happens to be just what it takes for the equation containing @xmath96 to be automatically satisfied . in total , this gives at hand that the complete solution of the @xmath0 pure spinor constraint is parameterised by the 23 variables @xmath98 .",
    "+   + we now turn to the expression for the volume form for the pure spinor .",
    "it is expected to be given by @xmath99={\\lambda}_0^\\alpha { \\ensuremath{\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}}}{\\lambda}_0{\\ensuremath{\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}}}^5{\\lambda}_1{\\ensuremath{\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}}}^{10}{\\lambda}_2{\\hspace{1mm}}\\omega^\\beta { \\ensuremath{\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}}}\\omega{\\ensuremath{\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}}}^6{\\omega^1}_1 $ ] for some numbers @xmath100 and @xmath101 , but a counting of the two @xmath86 charges immediately gives at hand that @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "what remains is to show the @xmath61 invariance of the volume form .",
    "the first step in this is to show the @xmath104 invariance of @xmath105 , after which one can proceed to the full volume form .",
    "the calculations are a bit tedious , but everything works out .",

    "@xcite , carrying exactly two factors of @xmath109 .    as a representative pure spinor @xmath16 in the generic , 22-dimensional orbit under @xmath110 ,",
    "i.e. , one with @xmath111 , one can take the pure spinor with only the two numbers @xmath64 and @xmath108 non - vanishing , and @xmath112 , implying @xmath113 .",

    "the integration described in the following subsection will have a natural interpretation in terms of the calabi  yau geometry on pure spinor space .",
    "as stated above , the volume form for the pure spinor contains seven inverse powers of the pure spinor , so that the combined volume form for the superspace variables is : @xmath120={\\lambda}^{-7}\\mathrm{d}^{11 } x{\\hspace{1mm}}\\mathrm{d}^{32 } \\theta { \\hspace{1mm}}\\mathrm{d}^{23 } { \\lambda}\\ ] ] however , this does not suffice as a measure factor for the action , as it has the wrong ghost number and dimensional properties . a proper @xmath121",

    "it would exclude a lot of states in @xmath20 , due to @xmath20 being an expansion in the variables , some parts of which would have higher powers of the superspace variables than that type of measure could take .",
    "neither is it a priori clear how to perform integration over the 23 holomorphic variables @xmath16 .",
    "a treatment using only these variables typically has to be either non - manifestly covariant or involve picture changing operators @xcite .",
    "the trick is instead to introduce the non - minimal variables @xcite ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) and extend the formalism into the non - minimal formalism , which is a possibility due to the properties of @xmath19 , which will be discussed below .",
    "the previously mentioned conditions on the non - minimal variables : @xmath38 a pure spinor with ghost number @xmath34 and @xmath39 a fermionic spinor of ghost number @xmath125 with @xmath126 , both of the same dimension ( @xmath41 ) , is just what it takes in order to form a proper measure factor for the action .",

    "note the conditions on an integrand in order for it to be finite , listed in eq . .",
    "if an operator obeys those conditions , it can be shown that it is brst equivalent with an operator which is not singular with respect to @xmath230 , as in ref .",
    "for sym . moreover",
    ", since we only are interested in brst - equivalent classes of operators ( the key feature of the introduction of regulators in subsection [ subsub.q ] ) , the singular operator can be exchanged for its regular brst - equivalent .",
    "the principle is that an integration over @xmath121 $ ] ( without @xmath231 $ ] ) can remove the negative effective powers of @xmath151 and @xmath144 in the operator , so a new set of variables ( with the same properties as the first ) is introduced and integrated over .",
    "the result is an operator dependent on the non - minimal variables , which does not contribute to any divergence at the origin or at the singular submanifold . as the procedure can be performed for any number of operators , and all operators fulfil eq . , each and every integrand has a representative of its orbit under brst equivalence which satisfies eq .",
    "that is why this procedure , described below , regularises the divergence with respect to negative powers of @xmath230 .",
    "a sketch of the procedure is as follows . with the introduction of two constant pure spinors @xmath232 and @xmath233 ( corresponding to a new set of @xmath36 and @xmath38 )",
    "a change of the operator might be performed : @xmath234[\\mathrm{d}\\bar{f}]e^{-f\\bar{f}}e^{i\\varepsilon(fw+\\bar{f}\\bar{w})}o({\\lambda},\\bar{{\\lambda}})=\\nonumber\\\\ = & \\big[{\\lambda}'=e^{i\\varepsilon fw}{\\lambda}{\\hspace{1 mm } } , { \\hspace{1mm}}\\bar{{\\lambda}}'=e^{i\\varepsilon \\bar{f}\\bar{w}}\\bar{{\\lambda } } \\big]=\\\\ = & \\int[\\mathrm{d}f][\\mathrm{d}\\bar{f}]e^{-f\\bar{f}}o({\\lambda}',\\bar{{\\lambda}}')\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , ( @xmath235 , @xmath236 ) are pure spinors just as ( @xmath16 , @xmath224 ) respectively . since the operator diverges no more than is taken care of by @xmath237[\\mathrm{d}\\bar{f}]$ ] , it would not contribute any negative factors of @xmath151 or @xmath144 to an integrand .",
    "for such a construction to be possible , suitable `` translation '' operators @xmath238 and @xmath239 must be available , and the process must be possible to describe through the introduction of a new regulator . to begin with the operators , the @xmath240 s represent gauge invariant versions of the @xmath108 s . if the @xmath108 s were to be used instead of the @xmath240 s , eq . would incorporate @xmath241 , which is not necessarily a pure spinor . for that to be true ,",
    "a certain gauge must be chosen , with specific constraints on combinations of for example @xmath108 and @xmath242 , but the equations need to be independent of the choice of gauge .",
    "that is what calls for the construction of derivatives that are obtained using projectors on the cotangent space of pure spinors in @xmath0 :",
    "@xmath243 the reason for this expression for the projection @xmath244 is that it acts as the identity on tangent vectors @xmath245 which fulfil @xmath246 .",
    "essentially , the pure spinor constraint is enforced by the removal of the parts which would not automatically obey it , by the presence of @xmath247 .",
    "the construction of @xmath240 is far more complicated in @xmath0 than in @xmath5 .",
    "it is presented in detail in appendix [ app.pro ] : @xmath248}{\\bar{f}})({\\lambda}{\\gamma}^{ij}{\\lambda})({\\lambda}{\\gamma}^{kl})_\\beta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath249 and @xmath250 . moreover , with a short notation according to @xmath251 , the above gives at hand a `` translated '' pure spinor : @xmath252    analogously , the form for @xmath253 is found by a change of all barred and unbarred variables : @xmath254 and correspondingly for all other indices which exist in both versions .",
    "what is important for the continuation of the description of the regularisation procedure is that the correct , gauge invariant derivatives can be constructed .    in order to describe the process through the introduction of a new regulator , a full set of variables must be introduced .",
    "not only the pure spinors are needed , but also constant fermions @xmath255 and @xmath256 with constraints : @xmath257=\\{q,\\bar{g}\\}=0{\\hspace{1 mm } } , \\quad [ q,\\bar{f}]=\\bar{g}{\\hspace{1 mm } } , \\quad \\{q , g\\}=f\\ ] ] this can be compared to the introduction of the non - minimal variables , though the unbarred variables imitate ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) instead .",
    "with denotes that every @xmath258 in the expression is replaced by an @xmath259 . ]",
    "@xmath260 we then have that @xmath261 contains a term @xmath262 , as well as that @xmath263 contains a term @xmath264 , which means that it is possible to do a construction as in eq . .",
    "in fact , the correct regularisation for an operator ( acting on fields etc . ) is : @xmath265[\\mathrm{d}\\bar{f}][\\mathrm{d}g ] [ \\mathrm{d}\\bar{g}]e^{-\\{q,\\bar{f}g\\ } } e^{i\\varepsilon\\{q , gw+\\bar{f}\\bar{v}\\}}o(z)e^{-i\\varepsilon\\{q , gw+\\bar{f}\\bar{v}\\}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this takes care of the divergences of the operator in question , if the singularity is not too bad ( see below ) .",
    "it also performs another regularisation , necessary due to the introduction of the integration over the new variables : the first type of regularisation discussed above , for the set of variables represented by ( @xmath266 , @xmath242 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 ) .    in total",
    ", we have a procedure that provides a smoothing of a singular operator .",
    "performed once , it takes care of singularities within the limits of eq . .",
    "if that is not sufficient , the procedure can be performed over and over and again .",
    "each time , new variables are introduced and the smoothing of the operator or integrand corresponds to a smoothing of the maximally allowed singularity in eq . .",
    "eventually , this gives at hand a regular expression .",
    "the number of times this procedure must be performed is roughly determined by how high a negative power of @xmath143 there is present in the expression in question , as it is the only scalar that shows up with negative powers in the operators . as",
    "such , the power of @xmath144 represents the worst singularity , with `` one smoothing procedure '' taking care of no more than @xmath269 .",
    "a general regularisation is therefore typically very intricate .",
    "the geometrical interpretation though , can be compared to a `` heat kernel '' regularisation .",
    "it can most certainly be replaced by a more geometric construction explicitly involving smoothing by the laplacian on the pure spinor space .",
    "this would involve further geometric investigations along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , but it is not clear that it would provide any calculational advantage , especially since it would not respect the splitting into separate holomorphic and antiholomorphic factors of the present approach .",
    "the above establishes that the proposed regularisations work .",
    "but in what way do they show up in a typical integrand , originating in e.g. an amplitude diagram ?",
    "worth to note about regularisations in general is that they can be performed in random order and at any time up until the properties which they alter are being used . for the general regularisations described above , this is not much of a restriction , since they do not meddle with an expression very much , in contrast to the loop regularisation which will be introduced below .",
    "the regularisation in eq . contains no derivatives , and therefore changes none of the variables that were present before the introduction of the regulator , while the variables the regularisation method described in eq .",
    "acts on are replaced by variables of very similar ( indeed , partly identical ) properties .",
    "furthermore , the introduced variables exist in a very limited region ( one operator ) and are integrated out , properties which combine in such a way as to restrict the impact of the alteration to one thing only : the regularisation of the expression in question .",
    "in specific , this means that the general regularisations can be inserted at any time up until the integration over the superspace variables , yielding the same result . as such",
    ", the regularisations due to the pure spinors can be kept implicit in the examinations of the amplitude diagrams , and as a rule they are never mentioned .    however , not all regulators are as well behaved as the above , which will be noted in the next subsection .",
    "the regularisation which is necessary to introduce due to the presence of loops acts on the variables in a slightly different way , exchanging one for another .",
    "in contrast to the regularisations above , that means that the regularisations must be performed at a certain time  before properties of different variables are being used .      at the introduction of loops , in contrast to a description with tree diagrams only ,",
    "a problem with the phase space field theory construction typically occurs : it lacks the description of the freedom of momenta etc . that is introduced by the formation of a loop .",
    "this occurs when the propagator is too local with respect to one of its bosonic variables , e.g. a function @xmath270 in space . at the integration over the vertices attached to a loop ,",
    "compare figure [ simpampldiags ] , the last integration then must be performed over @xmath271 , which diverges .",
    "this last expression , present when one integration remains , is what is interesting in the examination of amplitude diagrams , and something divergent does not make any sense .",
    "ordinarily , this problem does not show up due to the presence of a kinetic term in the theory .",
    "as such the propagator in the momentum space is expressible in terms of an exponential of the laplacian , instead of a factor 1 , and the phase space propagator is not too local , but a gaussian curve : @xmath272    the above is also the case for the variable @xmath33 in maximal supergravity described with the pure spinor formalism , but only because of the gauge fixing , which gives at hand the relevant dynamics ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "the theory contains two more bosonic variables @xmath142 without corresponding kinetic terms .",
    "moreover , the propagator is too local with respect to them , represented by @xmath206-functions , and needs to be changed into a less local one in order for the theory to make sense .",
    "one possible way to do that is to deform the theory by introducing suitable kinetic terms , giving at hand properties for the propagator as in eq .",
    "with respect to the pure spinors as well as @xmath33 .",
    "however , such a deformation is not desirable , as the theory would be deformed as well , and there would be no way of connecting results provided by it to results in maximal supergravity .    instead , the key feature to be recognised is that the pure spinor formalism gives at hand a possibility to _ imitate _ the construction in eq .",
    ", through the use of brst - equivalent terms .",
    "either a suitable regulator is added , a process which bears a striking similarity to the expression on the left hand side in eq .",
    ", or else the @xmath163 operator might be changed into something less local , yet still with the property @xmath273 .",
    "such a conversion , in either direction , can of course be done for any number of propagators in a loop diagram .",
    "in essence , it means that it is possible to exchange the too local propagator in phase space for a less local one .",
    "the result is a remaining integration over a function which is finite , and the problem is solved .",
    "a possible observation at this point is that the general regularisation described in eq .",
    "performed on a @xmath163 operator might do for the description of a not too local propagator .",
    "however , that regularisation is quite intricate and it is far from obvious how to extract any loop properties with such a construction . at the end of the day , another solution is sought for , with which properties of amplitude diagrams might be observed before the final regularisation in eq . .",
    "a @xmath19-invariant alteration of the @xmath163 operator into something less local , still obeying @xmath273 , might be a convenient way of finding a solution . the construction of eq . with @xmath274",
    "seems to provide such a deformation , but is extremely unpractical to use in loop calculations .",
    "we have put some effort into trying to find alternative explicit expressions for @xmath163 , not involving extra variables , but have not succeeded . although we still do not want to exclude the possibility of finding a more efficient , non - local but regular , propagator ; given the present status of the propagator ,",
    "what remains is the introduction of one more regulator .      in superspace , the only apparent way of regularising a loop , while retaining any possibility of extracting results , is to recognise the freedoms of momenta etc . in the loop , instead of using the last @xmath206-part of the propagator , in each loop , which would diverge . in figure [ vertices ]",
    "the latter corresponds to gluing two connected propagators together , so that there only is one @xmath206-function which by the fusion turns into `` @xmath271 '' .",
    "but instead of using this last @xmath206-function , which is superfluous and does not capture the loop properties , all the momenta in the loop ( of number @xmath275 ) are changed so that the freedoms of the loop momenta are described : @xmath276 for the terms in the loop in consideration , and the corresponding for @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath279 , @xmath280 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "each of these `` coordinates '' of the cotangent space represents a new variable , ranging in value within its domain , so it is also necessary to introduce the corresponding integration measures , which implies that the process corresponds to the following : @xmath284\\rightarrow \\int f(b_{new},p+p^i)[\\mathrm{d}z]\\mathrm{d}^dp^i[\\mathrm{d}d^i][\\mathrm{d}n^i][\\mathrm{d}\\bar{n}^i][\\mathrm{d}s^i]\\ ] ] here , @xmath285 is such that each @xmath163 depends on the momenta and the loop momenta of the loop that the propagator is part of - ghost depends on the original momenta and the momenta of the loops : @xmath286 . ]",
    "the last three integration measures are schematically given as here temporarily denotes both @xmath287 and @xmath288 , and the initial integration is with respect to @xmath108 , which however must show up in the gauge invariant quantities described by the @xmath287 s .",
    "the corresponding is true for @xmath289 and @xmath290 . ] : @xmath291&\\sim{\\lambda}^{-16}\\mathrm{d}^{23}n^i{\\hspace{1mm}},\\quad [ \\mathrm{d}\\bar{n}^i]\\sim\\bar{{\\lambda}}^{-16}\\mathrm{d}^{23}\\bar{n}^i { \\hspace{1mm}},\\quad [ \\mathrm{d}s^i]\\sim\\bar{{\\lambda}}^{16}\\mathrm{d}^{23}s^i\\label{eq.dnds}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the powers of @xmath16 and @xmath136 , which are only given schematically , follow from the simple observation that while @xmath99\\sim{\\lambda}^{-7}\\mathrm{d}^{23}{\\lambda}$ ] , the inverse metric governs the integration over cotangent space , which then becomes @xmath292\\sim{\\lambda}^7\\mathrm{d}^{23}\\omega\\sim{\\lambda}^{-16}\\mathrm{d}^{23}n$ ] .",
    "however , the amplitudes are independent of @xmath282 , @xmath283 , @xmath280 and @xmath281 , the forms of which are described in eq .",
    ", as these quantities do not show up in any expression .",
    "they certainly are not present in any term which is not a regulator , nor in the regularisation presented in eq . due to the form of it .",
    "moreover , the absence of the two last quantities gives at hand that the amplitudes can not depend on @xmath279 or @xmath278 either @xcite , so a regulator is needed in order for the integration to make sense , @xmath207 : @xmath293=\\nonumber\\\\&=k\\big(({\\lambda}d)s+({\\lambda}\\sigma_{ab } d ) s^{ab}-n\\bar{n}-n_{ab}\\bar{n}^{ab}\\big)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the components of @xmath277 in each @xmath294 etc .",
    "here have been kept implicit , as is most convenient .",
    "as long as the free loop momenta have not been integrated out , they are present in every momentum term .",
    "the expression above brings us back to the interpretation of the regularisation as originating in the introduction of a regulator .",
    "it has certain properties which will be discussed in more detail below , such that an @xmath134 can be turned into `` @xmath295 '' for example @xcite , but for now , we continue the examination of the impact of the regulator on the newly introduced integrations . as it provides the only terms that the integrations in eq .",
    "( [ eq.dnds ] ) concern , those integrations ( with the regulator and all other terms implicit ) give at hand @xcite : @xmath296[\\mathrm{d}\\bar{n}^i][\\mathrm{d}s^i ] \\sim\\frac{1}{{\\lambda}^{16}{\\bar{\\lambda}}^{16}}\\int[\\mathrm{d}s^i ] \\sim { \\lambda}^7 ( d+\\sum_i d^i)^{23}\\ ] ] from this we can see , for example , that in order for the free , fermionic momenta of @xmath290 to be integrated out , the terms need to be taken from the regulator , which brings down an extra term `` @xmath297 '' for each @xmath290 that needs to be integrated out .",
    "the end result is furthermore quite convenient as a factor @xmath107 has been provided for the volume form @xmath99\\sim{\\lambda}^{-7}\\mathrm{d}^{23}{\\lambda}$ ] in @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "however , as there are 32 spinors @xmath277 for each loop , the result for the entirety of the newly introduced integrations is : @xmath298[\\mathrm{d}\\bar{n}^i][\\mathrm{d}s^i][\\mathrm{d}d^i]\\mathrm{d}^dp^i\\stackrel{\\eqref{eq.regpart1}}{\\sim } { \\lambda}^7 \\mathrm{d}^{9}d^i{\\hspace{1mm}}\\mathrm{d}^dp^i\\ ] ]    the effective integration thus requires 9 @xmath277 s per loop to be extracted from the amplitude diagrams in order for a non - zero result .",
    "these must be provided either through the @xmath277 s already present in the propagators and vertices , or through the use of the regulator .",
    "the last part of eq .",
    "is the integration over the momenta @xmath299 present in the loops , which is done up to some momentum cut - off limit , @xmath300 . with respect to the finiteness of the theory ,",
    "these last integrations need further examination . part of this , more specifically the uv behaviour of the amplitude diagrams , will be discussed in the next section .",
    "all in all , the introduction of the momenta freedoms and their integration measures changes the integration over each loop so that a finite result can be obtained .",
    "the procedure corresponds to an integration over the cotangent space to a point in superspace , described with the real metric , which is calabi  yau .",
    "as noted for the general regularisations , regulators can be introduced randomly up until their properties , or the properties they affect , are used .",
    "the latter is what makes the loop regularisation a bit trickier than the general regularisations .",
    "the apparent condition brought on by the regularisation is that 9 @xmath277 s per loop need to be extracted from the integrand .",
    "this in itself is rather harmless , though crucial for the amplitude properties .",
    "the complication is brought on by that @xmath134 can be converted into @xmath294 : @xmath301 the above calls for two different observations .",
    "firstly , the first transformation can not be applied to any @xmath134 which is a part of a structure as the one described in eq . .",
    "due to symmetry properties , the result would be zero .",
    "that is why the first transformation only can be applied to @xmath134 s part of the operator @xmath22 in the 4-point vertex , and only after the second transformation has been used at least once , at that .    secondly , the above clearly changes the algebraic properties of the indices attached to the @xmath134 s which are to be transformed . unless the indices , naively described as @xmath302 `` before '' regularisation ,",
    "are part of structures that ensure them to be antisymmetrised regardless of the presence of the @xmath134 s , such as individual operators , they are not necessarily restricted to be antisymmetrised .",
    "then , one has to take the regularisation into consideration before using the properties of the non - minimal variable @xmath134 . in short ,",
    "the constituent part need to be regularised before they are put together .",
    "the simplest solution to the above might have been not to use the property of the regulator which changes variables according to eq . .",
    "indeed , where that is possible , that is what we will do .",
    "it is , as described above , quite all right to choose to examine any term in the expansion of a regulator ( as long as the constant one is kept , of course ) ; the answer will be correct , provided that it is not nonsense like @xmath150",
    ". however , without the use of the regulator , all terms with a factor @xmath303 with @xmath304 would incorrectly give at hand a zero contribution , due to the fact that one @xmath136 invariably is part of the integrand .",
    "the condition @xmath305 then reduces the degrees of freedom of the fermionic spinor @xmath134 to 23 .",
    "but the fact that the @xmath134 can not show up in any higher powers than 23 does not prevent the presence of `` converted '' @xmath134 s .",
    "so all terms with @xmath134 to a higher power than 23 need to be brought into a form with @xmath306 in order to be interpreted correctly , a procedure which is carried through with the help of the loop regulator .    to be precise",
    ", one may note that @xmath134 and @xmath294 in a certain manner can be treated on an equivalent basis . not only due to the transformation property of eq . , but due to the fact that the presence of an @xmath134 in an operator only comes at the expense of a @xmath294 , compared to the terms with lower powers of @xmath134 , compare e.g. eq . . at the examination of",
    "whether or not an expression needs to be regularised with respect to @xmath134 , one might therefore consider only the terms solely consisting of @xmath134 s , without the presence of any @xmath294 , and note that a regularisation with respect to @xmath134 only gives a non - zero result if the power of @xmath134 present exceeds or equals @xmath307 .",
    "this allows for the @xmath306 remaining after the conversion and the @xmath308 required for each loop integration in order for a non - zero result , and provides a most convenient way of determining when there might be too many @xmath134 s present in an expression .",
    "moreover , note that the @xmath134 s remaining after the loop regularisation are distributed across the former positions of @xmath134 . where they sit does not alter any properties of the expression .",
    "this is on equal footing with the fact that if part of a loop structure , which on its own does not need to be regularised , displays certain properties when it is not regularised , those same properties will be present when it is regularised as a part of the entire loop structure .",
    "we have brst invariance , so the properties obtained are the correct ones .",
    "the converted @xmath134 s need only be taken into account when properties dependent on structures with too many @xmath134 s present are being examined .",
    "the loop regularisation and the formation of loops are the key features restricting the constituent parts of the loops and in what ways they can be put together into amplitude diagrams with tree parts . the first condition , 9 @xmath294 s to be extracted from each loop , is fairly straightforward . the conversion of @xmath134 s into @xmath294 s and the fact that loop operators are allowed to act in all directions on the other hand unsurprisingly gives at hand that even the description of a diagram with only a few loops is quite intricate .",
    "the most apparent properties will be discussed below though .    to begin with",
    ", we may take note of the different parts of an amplitude diagram .",
    "there are two different kinds : planar and non - planar diagrams , the former which can be drawn on a plane without ever crossing a line .",
    "that is a property which refers to the composition of the loop structure . in the general scheme of things",
    "though , tree parts are connected to a loop structure via a number of so called outer legs , as are the external legs that do not connect to tree parts . moreover , although some diagrams , tree diagrams , do not contain a loop structure , those will not be treated below , as no surprising restriction on the properties thereof occurs .",
    "what we will begin by discussing is the loop structure itself , starting out with the most simple case , the one - loop amplitude .",
    "an examination of it shows why bubbles and triangles are absent in amplitude diagrams .",
    "this naturally carries on towards a discussion on the splitting of momenta between different loops , particularly with respect to the presence of outer legs , and to some degree the conditions on non - planar diagrams also .",
    "it is , however , difficult to discern properties of structures which require regularisation with respect to @xmath134 .",
    "the question of when such regularisations are required is addressed in the next section , on the uv characteristics of the amplitude diagrams .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the picture of the loop structures which has emerged , and finally , the general conditions on the amplitudes are taken into account , with respect to the `` outer components '' that are not part of the loop structure . in total , this gives at hand a fairly detailed , general description of the amplitude diagrams .",
    "a known feature of amplitude diagrams in maximal supergravites is that they can not contain any bubbles or triangles ( loops with less than four vertices attached ) @xcite . in the formalism here",
    "presented , this is a consequence of the fact that each loop for a non - zero result needs to contribute 9 @xmath294 s to the integration over the loop variables .",
    "as is shown below , this can not be provided by a bubble or a triangle , no matter what their outer legs are connected to , so no bubbles or triangles can exist as parts of a loop structure .",
    "the reasoning goes as follows . to begin with we address",
    "the question of whether or not loop regularisation with respect to @xmath134 will be necessary , compare subsection [ subsub.matterloop ] , which it turns out not to be .",
    "each set of vertex and propagator operators s and one @xmath163 in the case of a 3-point vertex , and the additional @xmath22 in the case of a 4-point vertex .",
    "a bubble consists of no more than two such sets and a triangle of three , although the 4-point vertex only can show up once . ]",
    "contains at most @xmath309 , or @xmath310 ( for the 4-point vertex ) , yielding that the highest possible power of @xmath134 present in a one - loop amplitude with less than 4 vertices is @xmath311 .",
    "although this power is greater than @xmath141 , that term is accompanied by no @xmath294 and can not give at hand @xmath312 from regularisation , and as such vanishes . effectively , a bubble or a triangle contains no terms with @xmath313 , @xmath304 on its own .",
    "thus , as @xmath207 is @xmath19-exact , the exponential term does not determine whether or not a bubble or a triangle exists , and it may be treated as a factor 1 . as such , @xmath134 s can not be converted into @xmath294 s , and a propagator or a vertex can at most contribute with two @xmath294 s to the loop integration .",
    "this would be enough to exclude bubbles , but not triangles .",
    "however , each unregularised vertex can not contribute with more than one @xmath294 to one and the same loop integration , since the antisymmetrisation of the indices in @xmath191 and @xmath314 ensures that the indices of their two @xmath294 s are symmetrised , whereas they need to be the opposite of that .",
    "furthermore , the part of the propagator which might contribute with two @xmath294 s looks like @xmath315 , compare eq . .",
    "this quantity is fermionic , which gives at hand that in order for two propagators to both contribute with two @xmath294 s to the loop integration , those two parts must be be antisymmetrised . at the same time",
    ", the four @xmath294 s must be antisymmetrised , as the 9 @xmath294 s are . in order for the latter condition to be true ,",
    "the two factors of @xmath316 need to be symmetrised , in which case the former condition is such that the two factors of @xmath317 need to be antisymmetrised .",
    "this is an apparent contradiction as the sets @xmath318 and @xmath319 can not be both symmetrised and antisymmetrised at the same time , with the consequence that two propagators can not both contribute with two @xmath294 s to one and the same loop integration .    in total",
    ", only one propagator can contribute with @xmath320 to one and the same loop integration , the rest of the propagators as well as the vertices can not contribute with more than one @xmath294 each .",
    "this renders bubbles non - existent , since they at most can contribute @xmath321 to the loop integration .",
    "the same goes for the triangle , which at most can contribute @xmath322 to the loop integration . for 9 @xmath294 s ,",
    "at least four legs need to be attached to the loop .",
    "any one - loop amplitude thus must have at least four external legs .",
    "moreover , with the analogy observed in subsection [ subsub.matterloop ] , every loop in an amplitude diagram must have at least four vertices , so neither bubbles nor triangles exist in maximal supergravity .",
    "it is important to note , that the absence of bubbles and triangles not always is enough to render an amplitude diagram non - zero , with respect to the 9 @xmath294 s that need to be claimed for each loop .",
    "for example , if a propagator is shared between several loops ( possibly more than two if the diagram is non - planar ) , its ( absolute ) maximum contribution of 3 @xmath294 s to the surrounding loops might fall short of what is needed . in such a case , there would be a requirement for one or several of the outer legs to be attached to some of the loops in question in order for the diagram to be non - zero . as each outer leg adds a propagator to the loop to which it is attached , the @xmath294 s that propagator could provide to the loop integration would ease the requirement on the contribution from the first propagator , otherwise shared between too many loops .",
    "this brings us to a more detailed examination of how the momenta in a loop can take values in the degrees of freedom introduced by the loops , as well as the original momenta , which is another feature of the loop regularisation .",
    "this is represented by e.g. @xmath323 with @xmath275 summed over the different loops the original momenta constitute a part of . to simply assume that these types of momenta end up distributed randomly , even taking into account that 9 @xmath277 s must be removed for each loop integration , is to pursue matters a bit too far though .",
    "some terms vanish .",
    "consider , for example , the case of a one - loop amplitude with @xmath287 outer legs , or any part of a loop which can be constructed from one propagator to which @xmath324 outer vertices are attached .",
    "it has @xmath287 propagators that all , naively , have momenta : @xmath325 .",
    "they are all a part of the same loop , and no other , so even the possible term @xmath326 , for the general case , can just as well can be regarded as a @xmath327 . however , a @xmath163 operator placed between two certain vertices , called number 1 and 2 , can act in any direction since it is a part of a loop . the way it acts on or is acted on by the amplitude diagram and its loop regularisation",
    "is distributed across the entire structure .",
    "in fact , the description is equivalent to one where that @xmath163 operator is not placed between vertex number 1 and 2 , but instead placed on any of the other propagators , right next to the @xmath163 operator which was there in the initial description .",
    "this is perfectly fine operators on the same propagator in the picture where the loop momenta are absent .",
    "such a term would yield @xmath166 .",
    "however , this is not true when the loop momenta are present , and thus @xmath163 operators can be brought onto the same propagator through partial integration , with a non - zero result . ] . moreover , the two terms contain at the most @xmath328 , so the ensuing structure can be analysed before any regularisation with respect to @xmath134 .",
    "for example , some combinations of those two @xmath163 operators depend entirely on either the momenta @xmath329 , or the loop momenta @xmath327 , in which case we have a factor @xmath166 so that the term vanishes .",
    "let us be explicit .",
    "if an operator @xmath330 were to be part of _ one _ loop regularisation , it would effectively contain @xmath331 .",
    "this happens to the @xmath163 operators as well , and because of the property @xmath166 , two propagators which are part of the same loop structure can not be dependent entirely on the same set of momenta @xmath327 , with @xmath275 taking the value of a loop , or not .",
    "most propagators are split between the momenta of different loops , as the term @xmath332 is .    in specific , in the setting above , only one of the @xmath163 operators can depend entirely on the loop momenta @xmath327 .",
    "the rest at the very least contains one @xmath294 each , a property which will come in handy in the next section , on the uv behaviour of amplitude diagrams . in relation to the previous subsection",
    ", this is also the fundamental property that explains why no more than one of the propagators in a bubble or triangle can contribute with two @xmath294 s to the loop integration .",
    "moreover , the examination can be drawn a bit further .",
    "we note that the number of propagators that can be compared in this way , at the same time , without any transformation of @xmath134 , is at most 7 . out of these",
    ", one may depend on @xmath327 , another on @xmath329 , but the rest must be split between the two sets of momenta , and the entire expression for @xmath333 can be investigated .",
    "it is non - zero , but only for terms that in combination have @xmath334 as a part of them . in specific ,",
    "the remaining components originate in @xmath335 and @xmath336 and consists of terms with @xmath337 split between the momenta .",
    "when @xmath134 is not regularised , the propagators form no terms with @xmath338 .",
    "the vertex operators @xmath191 can be considered in a similar way .",
    "as they are bosonic and act around a loop back to its initial position , without vanishing along the way , the part which acts on components of the loop may be considered to give a zero contribution .",
    "the @xmath191 contributes its components to the loop regularisation , either through @xmath277 or @xmath327 .",
    "the latter can not form @xmath339 with another @xmath327 coming from vertex operators or propagators without any @xmath134 transformed , though .",
    "effectively , this brings with it that no @xmath339 can be formed , in total , and one @xmath191 for each vertex must contribute @xmath277 to the loop integration , for diagrams that need not be regularised with respect to @xmath134 , which will be discussed further in section [ sec.uv ] . for a summary of what all this means with respect to actual loop components , we now turn to the most simple example possible .",
    "the simplest case there is for a loop diagram is the one - loop amplitude which consists of four propagators and four 3-point vertices . in order to illustrate the properties presented above",
    ", we will have a closer look at the non - zero components of it .",
    "it contains at most a power of @xmath340 where no @xmath294 is present and the presence of a @xmath294 comes at the expense of one @xmath134 , yielding that all terms with @xmath313 , @xmath304 vanish .",
    "therefore , just as for bubbles and triangles , the conversion between @xmath134 and @xmath294 need not be considered and the maximal contribution of @xmath277 to the loop regularisation is 9 , the minimum required .",
    "this happens when one propagator contributes with @xmath341 through the presence of a term @xmath335 , compare subsection [ sub.op ] , and the rest of the vertices and propagators contribute with one @xmath277 each through the presence of four @xmath342 and three @xmath343 , the latter which need to be split between momenta ( apart from @xmath336 ) so that they contain one @xmath277 each .",
    "moreover , due to the lack of the @xmath344 term in the antisymmetrisation of the split @xmath163 operators , as mentioned right before this example , not two of the propagators can be represented by @xmath187 .",

    "furthermore , the property that no term with @xmath339 can be formed applies for all loop structures that have not been regularised with respect to @xmath134 , even the ones with multiple loops .",

    "note that there may be several more features of the amplitude diagrams , not described above . as previously mentioned though",

    "in the presence of loops , integrations over the free momenta @xmath299 are introduced .",
    "these integrations are performed up to some large momentum cut - off limit @xmath300 , which typically threatens to make the expressions divergent .",
    "the infrared behaviour of this needs a detailed investigation , and will not be discussed here , but the examination of the ultraviolet behaviour is rather straightforward .",
    "the dependence on the momentum cut - off goes as : @xmath364 here , @xmath346 is the number of loops , @xmath294 the dimension ( e.g. after a dimensional reduction ) , @xmath365 the number of propagators that are part of the loops and @xmath92 the number of loop momenta that can be constructed and paired up into @xmath339 in the loops .",
    "the theory is uv divergent if @xcite @xmath366    as discernible above , the dimensional dependence enters through the integration over the loop momenta @xmath299 , which there is @xmath294 of in each of the @xmath346 loops .",
    "the second term in the expression ( @xmath367 ) represents the uv contribution of loop momenta from the propagators : @xmath368 moreover , the last term of @xmath92 must be even since parts that contain unpaired @xmath327 s give a zero contribution at the integration over @xmath369 .",
    "an interesting question is whether or not maximal supergravity is finite in , say , four dimensions . in specific ,",
    "what conditions does the framework of the formalism presented above set on the theory , in order for it to be finite ?",
    "this question is what we address below , first by a look at what loop structures look like with respect to their uv contribution , and later on by discerning what parts of them give at hand the worst dependence on the momentum cut - off .",
    "lastly , we look at what this worst dependence looks like , for as it turns out , it is generally provided by the amplitude diagrams that need regularisation with respect to the number of @xmath134 s .",
    "the only part of an amplitude diagram which contributes to the uv behaviour , brought on by the loop regularisation , is the loop structure .",
    "the behaviour is described by eq .",
    ", where only one part is unknown , the term @xmath92 describing the number of loop momenta that can be paired up into scalars in the loop structure .",
    "furthermore , the number @xmath92 is only unknown for amplitudes which are regularised with respect to @xmath134 , a procedure we will refer to as just `` regularisation '' from here on .",
    "recall , from the previous section , that no quantity @xmath339 can be formed out of unregularised components . for diagrams that do not need to be regularised",
    ", we therefore can conclude that the worst uv dependence appears for diagrams only consisting of 3-point vertices , for which the number of outer legs are as few as possible , in the following way : @xmath370 the reason for the restriction to a consideration of the minimal @xmath350 is obvious : it is what gives the worst uv behaviour , which is what we are interested in .",
    "moreover , the demand on @xmath294 in order for this exponent not to be negative for any @xmath346 or @xmath350 is not more severe than @xmath371 . this would arise from @xmath363 , @xmath354 , as the minimal @xmath350 s increase for low @xmath346 s , if indeed that amplitude does not need to be regularised .",
    "the question which remains to be answered is which conditions we have in general , as a function of @xmath346 .    in order to determine the worst possible uv behaviour in general",
    ", we need to know when it is necessary to perform regularisation with respect to @xmath134 , and how to interpret the components of the amplitude diagrams .",
    "this procedure might be anticipated to be tedious , but there is a convenient simplification for the case when the worst uv divergence is sought for , as is applicable here .",
    "it is possible to use the correspondence @xmath372 and @xmath373 in the search for when and how to regularise , and ultimately in the search of @xmath92 . as thus the problem",
    "is reduced to a matter of a counting of the power of @xmath134 that is present , and an examination of whether or not it is allowed to be formed according to the amplitude characteristics .",
    "the problem separates into two parts .",
    "the first one refers to the actual power of @xmath134 present , when the conditions for a requirement of regularisation are to be determined .",
    "the second refers to an effective power of @xmath134 : @xmath374 , which in the end gives at hand the uv characteristics .",
    "some properties are related though , which is why part of the discussion here will be performed simultaneously .",
    "we begin by having a look at the different parts of the amplitude diagrams , with respect to the above .",
    "parts outside of the loop structure , e.g. external legs or parts of a tree structure connecting the loop structure to external legs , do not change the uv behaviour of the loop .",
    "they only way they could do so , by causing a higher power of @xmath134 to be present and further regularisations to be necessary , provides only a superficial change , as noted in subsection [ subsub.matterloop ] . as such , we consider only the loop structure in order to determine the properties of it .    in supergravity , where vertex operators are present , this also means that operators that are associated with outer vertices can be assumed to act out of the loop as much as possible . which leg each of them act on is arbitrary , yielding the same result , and thus the version where as many @xmath134 s as possible get outside of the loop , not to be included in the loop regularisation , reflects the real properties of the loop with the least intermediate examination .",
    "for example , both 3- and 4-point vertices ( with 2 legs as part of the loop structure ) can be taken to contribute with @xmath191 only .",
    "furthermore , for regularised amplitudes , the number of outer legs is irrelevant .",
    "the conversion of a 3-point vertex into a 4-point one , with the new leg as an outer leg does not contribute anything new to the loop structure , as the @xmath22 can be assumed to act out of the loop .",
    "moreover , only one extra @xmath191 is contributed to the loop by the addition of an outer vertex , and the additional @xmath163 at most can contribute the equivalent of @xmath375 to the loop ( since each loop only can have one outer propagator completely made out of loop variables ) , so that introduction of an outer vertex goes as @xmath376 .",
    "consequently , for regularised amplitudes , the number of @xmath350 is irrelevant .",
    "let us start by counting the maximal power of @xmath134 that may be present in a loop structure .",
    "beginning with the @xmath163 operator , we may note that its maximal contribution corresponds to @xmath334 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath377 and @xmath378 . consequently , the 3-point vertex is represented by @xmath379 and the 4-point vertex by @xmath309 .",
    "furthermore , an amplitude diagram with only 3-point vertices contains @xmath349 propagators and @xmath355 vertices , compare subsection [ subsub.loopstr ] .",
    "the presence of a 4-point vertex decreases the number of propagators by one , and the number of 3-point vertices by two , giving at hand that the maximal power of @xmath134 present , for internal vertices , are _ less _ by a factor @xmath379 compared to a diagram of only 3-point vertices . for outer vertices ,",
    "the difference is at most @xmath380 , and the presence of the 4-point vertex can be recognised as insignificant due to the following reasons :    * for regularised amplitudes , the effective power of @xmath134 is unaffected by the 4-point vertex .",
    "the presence of @xmath381 in the propagator , so the 4-point vertex and the 4-point tree amplitude built from 3-point vertices are indistinguishable in the power counting of @xmath134 s .",
    "outer vertices do not need to be considered , as mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "* for low values of @xmath346 , the presence of the 4-point vertex increases the minimal number of @xmath350 to be attached by one .",
    "this is true for up to four loops , and we will see that higher loops require regularisation . however , when @xmath350 is increased by one , a new set of vertex operators is added and the maximal power of @xmath134 increased by @xmath309 . effectively , the maximal power of @xmath134 is thus increased by at least @xmath375 by the presence of the 4-point vertex , and it need not be considered when the question of when regularisation with respect to @xmath134 is needed is addressed .    in short ,",
    "the above states that only 3-point vertices need to be considered . for outer legs ,",
    "the contribution to the maximal power of @xmath134 is @xmath382 , and the effective contribution is @xmath344 . apart from that ,",
    "the relevant numbers of propagators and inner vertices are @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "the contributions with respect to the maximal number of @xmath134 for each such component are @xmath334 and @xmath379 respectively .    as such ,",
    "the maximal power of @xmath134 present in a loop diagram is given by the term @xmath383 . in order for this to give at hand new results with respect to the @xmath372 regularisation",
    ", the power must exceed that of @xmath384 : @xmath385 that is , when the condition above is fulfilled , the @xmath372 conversion must be taken into account , and eq .",
    "no longer holds .",
    "note that this always is true for , part of which was assumed above when the 4-point amplitude was neglected .",
    "moreover , it is true for any @xmath386 when the number of outer legs is not minimal .      in the search of the quantity @xmath92 , the effective power of @xmath134 present in a diagram is to be considered .",
    "the different parts are listed above , giving at hand @xmath134 to the power of @xmath387 . out of these ,",
    "@xmath307 are claimed by the loop regularisations and the @xmath134 s that need to be left untouched .",
    "the rest , @xmath388 , may be converted into @xmath389 @xmath60 s .",
    "furthermore , for the worst uv dependence , they are assumed to pair up into @xmath390 s to as great an extent as possible , which all of them can do as the number is even , and no further restrictions on the amplitude diagrams have been discerned .",
    "thus @xmath391 , giving at hand a maximal dependence on the cut - off @xmath392 : @xmath393=\\nonumber\\\\ & = { \\lambda}^{l(d-2)-14}{\\hspace{1mm}},\\quad 8l+5j>40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where this result is not valid , the dependence on @xmath300 is governed by the unregularised result .",
    "moreover , note that the regularised result for @xmath363 , @xmath354 is the same as if it had not been regularised , which originates in the property that the superfluous @xmath375 can not form a term @xmath338 .      to conclude , the previous subsection states that the the maximal dependences on @xmath300 and the subsequent requirements on @xmath294 in order for the theory to be uv finite are : @xmath394 this fits exactly with previous results , for example the ones in ref .",
