    "according to the concordance model of cosmology our universe has most probably begun from an initial singularity at a finite past .",
    "the introduction of the inflation paradigm as a successful way to solve the horizon , flatness and magnetic monopole problems , did not affect the initial singularity issue , which is still considered as a potential , conceptual disadvantage @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to describe the observed late - time universe acceleration a cosmological constant was added , leading eventually to the @xmath0cdm cosmology , namely the standard model of the universe . nevertheless , in spite of the remarkable successes of this paradigm , its physical content relating to the two accelerating phases at early and late times is still not satisfactory , and furthermore , the initial singularity problem remains open .",
    "there are two ways one could follow in order to bypass the initial singularity problem .",
    "the first is to consider the scenario of bouncing cosmology , in which the current universe expansion followed a previous contracting phase , with the scale factor being always non - zero @xcite .",
    "the second is to consider the scenario of `` emergent universe '' @xcite , in which the universe originates from a static state , namely from the `` einstein static universe '' , and then it enters the inflationary phase , without passing from any singularity .",
    "however , both these alternative cosmological scenarios can not be obtained in the framework of general relativity . concerning the einstein static universe , which is a necessary ingredient of the emergent universe scenario",
    ", it can be shown that it is significantly affected by the initial conditions such as perturbations , which dominate at the ultra - violet ( uv ) limit , and hence it is indeed unstable against classical perturbations which eventually lead it to collapse to a singularity @xcite .    in order to alleviate the above problems one may follow the way to introduce new degree(s ) of freedom , beyond the standard model of particle physics or / and general relativity .",
    "a first direction is to consider exotic forms of matter that could provide a successful description of the universe behavior in the framework of general relativity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the second direction is to construct a gravitational modification whose extra degrees of freedom could describe the universe at large scales , while still possessing general relativity as a particular limit @xcite .",
    "concerning the initial singularity issue , modified gravity , amongst others , can trigger the cosmological bounce @xcite , or it can cure the emergent universe scenario by making einstein static universe stable .",
    "in particular , the einstein static universe and thus the emergent universe scenario , can be successfully realized in various gravitational modifications , such as in einstein - cartan theory @xcite , in @xmath1 gravity @xcite , in @xmath2 gravity @xcite , in loop quantum cosmology @xcite , in massive gravity @xcite , in hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , in braneworld models @xcite , etc , although the successful exit from the einstein static universe towards the subsequent expanding thermal history is not always achieved .",
    "one interesting gravitational modification in the uv regime arises through the use of the `` generalized uncertainty principle '' @xcite , which seen as a quantum gravity approach might be related with other quantum gravity models such as double special relativity @xcite and string theory @xcite .",
    "although one can have more than one generalizations of the uncertainty principle , the most interesting one is when one modifies the standard heisenberg algebra by a linear and a quadratic term in planck length and momentum respectively , which leads to the existence of two natural uv cutoffs , namely minimum length and maximum momentum @xcite .",
    "hence , when applied to a cosmological framework , these natural cutoffs give rise to extra terms in the friedmann equations , which can have interesting implications .    in the present work we are interested in investigating the einstein static universe and the emergent universe scenario in the framework of theories with natural uv cutoffs .",
    "in particular , we show how the induced extra terms in the cosmological equations lead to the realization and stability of the einstein static universe , as well as offering the mechanism to a phase transition to the inflationary era and the subsequent thermal history of the universe .",
    "the plan of the manuscript is the following : in section [ model ] , we briefly review generalized uncertainty principle with two uv cutoffs , and we apply it in a cosmological framework . in section [ dynamicalanalysis ] , we examine the stability of the einstein static universe by performing a dynamical system analysis , studying its exit towards the inflationary era . in section [ perturbanal ]",
    "we extract the conditions under which the scenario is stable against scalar perturbations .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we provide the conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly present theories with natural uv cutoffs , and then we apply them in a cosmological framework . as we mentioned in the introduction , in general this kind of theories",
    "arise from the consideration of generalizations of the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "although one may have more than one such generalizations , in the present work we focus on the generalization with two natural uv cutoffs , namely a minimum length and a maximum momentum @xcite . in order to achieve this , one starts by modifying the standard heisenberg algebra at high energy scales , by a linear and a quadratic term in planck length and momentum respectively , as @xmath3 = i \\hbar \\left[\\delta_{i j } - \\alpha \\left(p \\delta_{i j}\\ ! + \\ !",
    "\\frac{p_i p_j}{p}\\right ) +   \\alpha^2 \\left(p^2 \\delta_{i j}\\ ! + \\ ! 3 p_i p_j\\right ) \\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath4 , where via the jacobi identity @xcite it is guaranteed that @xmath5=0=[p_i , p_j]$ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 quantifies the quantum gravity deformation parameter , and can alternatively be written as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 the planck mass and planck length respectively , @xmath10 the speed of light , and @xmath11 the induced planck constant .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 according to experiments is bound to be smaller than @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "let us now apply the above generalized uncertainty principle in a cosmological framework . since the quantum gravity deformation parameter @xmath6 is expected to have effects only at high energy scales , we will focus on the early - time phases of the cosmological evolution , which indeed will correspond to the realization of the emergent universe .",
    "we start by considering the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry , with metric @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scale factor and @xmath16 the lapse function , and with @xmath17 corresponding to flat , close and open spatial geometry respectively .",
    "one can extract the field equations in the above metric , i.e. the friedmann equations , via the hamiltonian constraint @xmath18 , namely @xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 the gravitational constant , and where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the lagrange multiplier and the momentum conjugate to the lapse function @xmath16 , respectively . in the above expression @xmath23",

    "as expected , in the limit @xmath39 they give rise to the standard friedmann equations .",
    "in this section we first show that in the cosmological application of the generalized uncertainty principle the einstein static universe can be realized .",
    "then , we express the cosmological equations as a first - order dynamical system and we perform a detailed phase - space analysis in order to examine its stability , i.e to see whether the universe can remain in such a phase for very large time intervals .",
    "let us first extract the einstein static universe solutions . inserting the conditions of the einstein static universe , i.e. a constant scale factor @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , at an energy density @xmath42 , in the two friedmann equations ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) , and focusing for mathematical convenience (",

    "performing linear perturbations around them , and examining the eigenvalues of the involved perturbation matrix , will reveal whether these solutions are stable or unstable @xcite . in the following two subsections we examine the flat and non - flat cases separately .      in the case of a flat geometry , and for a general @xmath51 ,",
    "the system ( [ 3 - 3]),([3 - 4 ] ) accepts only the trivial solution @xmath52 , independently of the values of @xmath6 .",
    "however , in the special case where @xmath53 , i.e where the universe is filled with a cosmological constant , we obtain an einstein static universe solution for every @xmath54 , with the corresponding scale factor being @xmath55 note that the role of a non - zero quantum gravity deformation parameter @xmath6 is crucial in making the above solution non - trivial , since for @xmath56 one obtains only the aforementioned trivial solution .",
    "let us now study the dynamical stability of this solution , following the usual procedure of dynamical system analysis @xcite .",
    "we introduce two variables , namely @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and hence the linear perturbations of the friedmann equation ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) , around the critical point ( [ 3 - 7flat ] ) and with @xmath53 , leads to @xmath59 hence , the eigenvalues square @xmath60 of the jacobian matrix @xmath61 calculated at the critical point ( [ 3 - 7flat ] ) , is just @xmath62 as usual , if the above eigenvalues square is negative then the corresponding critical point is stable , that is any small perturbation around this solution will decrease and the system will return to it .",
    "interestingly enough we observe that while for @xmath39 we obtain the usual result that @xmath63 , and therefore that the einstein static universe solution in cosmology with usual uncertainty principle is unstable , for a suitably large @xmath6 , namely for @xmath64 , we acquire @xmath65 and thus the einstein static universe becomes stable .",

    "<S> we investigate the realization of the emergent universe scenario in theories with natural uv cutoffs , namely a minimum length and a maximum momentum , quantified by a new deformation parameter in the generalized uncertainty principle . </S>",
    "<S> we extract the einstein static universe solutions and we examine their stability through a phase - space analysis . as we show , the role of the new deformation parameter is crucial in a twofold way . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it leads to the appearance of new einstein static universe critical points , that are absent in standard cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it plays a central role in providing a mechanism for a graceful exit from a stable einstein static universe into the expanding thermal history , that is needed for a complete and successful realization of the emergent universe scenario . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we examine the behavior of the scenario under scalar perturbations and we show that the deformation parameter makes it free of perturbative instabilities . </S>"
