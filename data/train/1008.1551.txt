    "recent advances in experimental techniques are providing access to unprecedented levels of control over quantum systems and turning the quest for the fundamental limits of metrology into a question of practical importance , instead of just a theoretical curiosity .",
    "the success of many experiments that rely on weak - signal detection inevitably depends on improvement of metrological methods that operate near the limits established by quantum mechanics .    in this regard ,",
    "several strategies have been proposed over the past few years in order to make quantum - limited metrology accessible to current experiments .",
    "most of these protocols focus on schemes for preparing optimal states , such as squeezed states , cat states , and path entangled states ( @xmath3 states ) , to be fed into linear interferometers .",
    "ideally , these states achieve sensitivities at the quantum limit for linear interferometry , often referred to as the _ heisenberg limit _  @xcite .",
    "the optimal input states , however , are difficult to prepare and very vulnerable to decoherence , thus making these protocols a major challenge for experimental realization . an alternative approach , using nonlinear interferometry , has emerged as a promising way to outperform @xmath0-limited linear interferometry without relying on entanglement or squeezing  @xcite .    in single - parameter estimation , the heisenberg limit corresponds to the best possible scaling of sensitivity with the resources available for the measurement , here taken to be the number of quantum subsystems available for the task .",
    "this scaling is not universal , but rather depends on the nature of the coupling between the quantum subsystems and the parameter to be estimated , and is enhanced by nonlinear couplings  @xcite .",
    "moreover , further analysis showed that this enhancement is purely a dynamical effect , which is independent of entanglement generation  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , makes the enhanced scaling potentially robust against decoherence , as opposed to the strategies previously mentioned .",
    "initial entangled states are required to achieve the optimal scaling in nonlinear metrology , but protocols that only involve separable states are sufficient to beat the @xmath0 heisenberg scaling of linear metrology  @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze the experiment proposed in  @xcite , which uses a two - mode bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath1 atoms to implement a nonlinear ramsey interferometer whose detection uncertainty scales better than the optimal @xmath0 heisenberg scaling of linear interferometry .",
    "this protocol takes advantage of the pairwise scattering interaction in a bec , which essentially allows interferometric phases to accumulate @xmath1 times faster than in a linear interferometer , thus permitting a measurement sensitivity that scales as @xmath2 .    as was investigated analytically in previous work  @xcite ,",
    "there are various challenges and potential problems in implementing such a measurement protocol and achieving the desired scaling . in view of currently available techniques and realistic experimental parameters",
    ", we further investigate such issues by means of numerical simulations and more accurate approximation procedures .",
    "we first review , in sec .",

    "[ dynamics ] ; these numerical results simulate the fringe signal of the protocol , allowing us to investigate how position - dependent phase shifts across the condensate degrade the fringe visibility .",
    "section  [ improvedmodel ] considers further the differentiation of the spatial wave functions of the two modes by investigating in some detail an alternative analytical approximation to the two - mode dynamics , proposed in  @xcite , which takes into account the effects of the position - dependent phase shifts for times before the two modes separate spatially .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] concludes with additional perspective on our results .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , a two - mode bec of @xmath1 atoms can be used to implement a nonlinear ramsey interferometer whose detection sensitivity scales better than @xmath0 .",
    "we briefly review in this section key aspects of this metrology protocol and of the zero - order model used to describe the evolution of the two - mode bec .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we consider a bec of @xmath4 atoms that can occupy two hyperfine states , henceforth labeled @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume the bec is at zero temperature and that all the atoms are initially condensed in state @xmath5 with wave function @xmath7 , which is the @xmath1-dependent solution ( normalized to unity ) of the time - independent gp equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the trapping potential , @xmath10 is the chemical potential , and @xmath11 is the intraspecies scattering coefficient .",
    "this coefficient is determined by the @xmath12-wave scattering length @xmath13 and the atomic mass @xmath14 according to the formula @xmath15 .",
    "we describe the system by the so - called josephson approximation , which assumes that both modes have and retain the same spatial wave function @xmath7 from eq .",
    "( [ timeindepgpe ] ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the bec dynamics is governed by the two - mode hamiltonian @xmath16 here @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) creates ( annihilates ) an atom in the hyperfine state @xmath19 , with wave function @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the mean - field single - particle energy , given by @xmath23 and the quantity @xmath24 is a measure of the inverse volume occupied by the condensate wave function @xmath20 .",
    "notice that this effective volume renormalizes the scattering interactions , thereby defining effective nonlinear coupling strengths @xmath25 .",
    "the josephson approximation applies if one can drive fast transitions between the two hyperfine levels , the two levels are trapped by the same external potential , the atoms only undergo elastic collisions , and the spatial dynamics are slow compared to the accumulation of phases in the two hyperfine levels . in addition , notice that the zero - temperature mean - field treatment of the josephson hamiltonian ( [ bechamil1 ] ) assumes that the quantum depletion of the condensate is negligible .",
    "we make this assumption throughout on the grounds that the depletion is expected to be very small @xcite .    the josephson - approximation evolution is described in a more convenient way in terms of schwinger angular - momentum operators  @xcite . introducing the operator @xmath26 , one finds that eq .",
    "( [ bechamil1 ] ) can be written as @xmath27 where we define two new coupling constants that characterize the interaction of the two modes , @xmath28 we omit _ c - number _ terms whose only effect is to introduce an overall global phase .",

    "( [ bechamil2 ] ) is analogous to that of an interferometer with nonlinear phase shifters  @xcite . due to the different scattering interactions , the first term of eq .",
    "( [ bechamil2 ] ) introduces a relative phase shift that is proportional to the total number of atoms in the condensate , whereas the @xmath29 term leads to more complicated dynamics that create entanglement and phase diffusion .",
    "both terms can be used to implement nonlinear metrology protocols whose phase detection sensitivity scales better than @xmath0 . for initial product states ,",
    "the entanglement created by @xmath29 has no influence on the enhanced scaling and therefore offers no advantage over the @xmath30 evolution . on the contrary",
    ", it is better to avoid the associated phase dispersion  @xcite , which can be accomplished by a suitable choice of the condensate atomic species .",
    "we consider a condensate of @xmath31rb atoms constrained to the hyperfine levels @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "these states possess scattering properties that offer a natural way to suppress the phase diffusion introduced by the @xmath29 evolution ; namely , the @xmath12-wave scattering lengths for the processes @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively , are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39  @xcite , with @xmath40 being the bohr radius , which implies that @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath29 term becomes negligible , and the effective dynamics is simply described by the @xmath42 coupling .",
    "this @xmath42 coupling is that of a linear ramsey interferometer ( i.e. , a coupling proportional to @xmath43 ) , which accumulates phase at a rate enhanced by a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "this allows the coupling constant @xmath45 to be estimated with a sensitivity that scales as @xmath46 .",
    "notice that the exact scaling can only be determined once the trapping potential is specified , since the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath47 depends on trap geometry .",
    "as in typical ramsey interferometry schemes , our protocol runs as follows .",
    "the atoms are first condensed to the state @xmath48 , and a fast optical pulse suddenly creates the superposition state @xmath49 , which brings the atomic state to [ @xmath50/\\sqrt{2}$ ] . a second transition between the hyperfine levels",
    "is then used to transform any coherence between the two modes into population information that is finally detected . for this second transition",

    "this fringe pattern allows one to estimate the coupling constant @xmath45 with an uncertainty given by @xmath60",
    "the several simplifying assumptions in the proposed model make it straightforward to see how a scaling approaching @xmath2 can be obtained .",
    "those assumptions were made based on rough calculations that suggest that the protocol is implementable with current techniques  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to examine the validity of those assumptions by numerically simulating the discussed interferometry scheme under realistic experimental conditions .",
    "as emphasized before , the exact scaling of the detection sensitivity ultimately depends on how @xmath47 varies with the number of atoms in the condensate , which is essentially determined by the geometry of the trapping potential , considering that @xmath61 is a measure of the volume occupied by the condensate . because of the repulsive interactions , the expansion of the bec with increasing @xmath1 dilutes the effective nonlinear couplings , which can ruin the enhanced scaling of the sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the atomic cloud can be reduced by using a potential with hard walls , which suppresses the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath47 .",
    "another strategy is to operate in traps of effectively lower dimension so that the condensate wave function has fewer dimensions to spread into .",
    "we thus determine the effect of the spreading of the condensate wave function captured by @xmath47 by numerically integrating the time - independent , three - dimensional gp equation  ( [ timeindepgpe ] )  @xcite .",
    "we restrict our numerical analysis to the case of highly elongated becs , which according to previous results  @xcite , offer the best scalings .",
    "we assume that the bec is tightly confined by a transverse harmonic potential and loosely trapped by a power - law potential ; i.e. , we consider cylindrically symmetric trapping potentials of the form @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these three potentials allow us to explore how the results depend on the hardness of the potentials .",
    "notice that the limit @xmath65 recovers the case of a hard - walled trap .    in the so - called quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) regime",
    ", the scattering interaction does not drive any appreciable dynamics in the transverse directions .",
    "one can thus approximate the condensate wave function by the product ansatz @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ground - state wave function of the transverse harmonic potential and @xmath68 is the solution of the one - dimensional , longitudinal gp equation @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the longitudinal part of the chemical potential and @xmath71 is the inverse transverse cross section of the condensate , given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "this quasi-1d approximation is valid only as long as the number of atoms in the condensate is small compared to an ( upper ) critical atom number @xmath74 , which is specified by determining when the scattering energy becomes as large as the transverse kinetic energy .",
    "this condition sets the characteristic energy required to excite any dynamics in the transverse dimensions .",
    "we thus define @xmath74 by solving the equation @xmath75 generally this equation would have to be solved numerically , but for @xmath76 , the kinetic energy term in eq .",

    "we can test whether this is a source of the frequency disparity by making an _ ad hoc _ adjustment to the model of this section . in particular , in using the analytical overlap  ( [ analyticaloverlap ] ) , we can use the longitudinal thomas - fermi probability density @xmath126 and its @xmath127 from eq .",
    "( [ tfetal ] ) , as the approximation instructs",
    ". we could instead adopt the _ ad hoc _ procedure of using the numerically computed @xmath47 plotted in fig .",
    "[ etaplot ] ; the transverse @xmath71 determined in this procedure from @xmath129 , is no longer that of the transverse ground state and acquires an @xmath1 dependence from @xmath47 and @xmath127 .    in figs .",
    "[ improved1000 ] and  [ improved5000 ] , we compare the numerical fringes with the imaginary part of the overlap  ( [ analyticaloverlap ] ) , computed using the _ ad hoc _ modification , for 1000 and 5000 atoms .",
    "the improved model , with this _ ad hoc _ adjustment , is surprisingly good at predicting both the fringe frequency and the reduction in fringe visibility , especially for @xmath102 ( the josephson - approximation fringes would have the same frequency discrepancy had we used the 1d thomas - fermi approximation and the transverse ground state to determine @xmath47 , instead of using the numerical value ) .",
    "we emphasize that the fringe visibility is preserved better by going to harder traps . within the improved model ,",
    "it is clear that the better fringe visibility of harder traps is due to the fact that as @xmath83 increases , the trapping potential becomes more flat - bottomed , making the atomic density profile more uniform across the trap and and thus reducing the size of the residual position - dependent phase shift .",
    "it is clear that our improved analytical model does indeed provide a more accurate description of the nonlinear evolution of the two - mode condensate and consequently of the fringe pattern of our protocol .",
    "notice , however , that for longer times effects that are not considered in this model , such as mode segregation , become significant and , therefore , the ramsey fringes can no longer be described by eq .",
    "( [ analyticaloverlap ] ) .",
    "as already noted , for @xmath87 and 5000 atoms , the nonlinear evolution is undergoing a revival well before @xmath130s , an effect that can not be described within our model .    throughout this analysis",
    "we consider the case of a one - dimensional bec whose ground - state wave function is supposed to be well approximated by the product ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) . in this approximation",
    "one assumes that the effect of the scattering interaction on the transverse degrees of freedom of the gas can be completely neglected . as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ spreading ] , this is a good approximation as long as the number of atoms in the condensate is small compared to the critical atom number @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , from fig .",
    "[ etaplot ] one sees that as @xmath1 approaches @xmath74 , the product wave function  ( [ ansatz ] ) fails to give an accurate estimate of the inverse volume @xmath47 .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is that as @xmath1 approaches the critical atom number @xmath131 , the condensate begins to spread in the transverse dimensions .",
    "indeed , the analysis in this section shows that we obtain a reasonably good account of the fringe signal by including a position - dependent phase shift to describe the reduction in fringe visibility and by allowing @xmath71 to change with @xmath1 as dictated by the numerical 3d ground - state wave function , thus reflecting the spreading of the condensate in the transverse dimensions .",
    "we present in this paper a detailed numerical analysis of a recent proposal of a ramsey interferometry scheme that takes advantage of the nonlinear scattering interactions in a two - mode @xmath31rb bose - einstein condensate to achieve detection sensitivities that scale better than the @xmath0 limit of linear metrology  @xcite . in view of current experimental techniques and typical parameters ,",
    "this scheme is a feasible proof - of - principle experiment that in terms of sensitivity scaling , can outperform heisenberg - limited linear interferometry .",
    "the proposed protocol does not rely on complicated state preparation or measurement schemes nor on entanglement generation to enhance the measurement sensitivity .",
    "we first analyze here how the scaling is affected by the expansion of the atomic cloud as a function of the number of atoms in the condensate and of the geometry of the trap , by considering the case of quasi-1d becs trapped by different potentials .",
    "later we find the exact dependence of the atomic density with the atom number @xmath1 , solving numerically the single - mode , three - dimensional gp equation .",
    "this allows us to pin down the exact scaling and to verify that in all the considered cases a scaling better than @xmath0 can be achieved .",
    "in addition , we simulate the proposed interferometric scheme and the corresponding measurement signal by solving the two - mode , coupled , three - dimensional gp equations . our numerical results not only confirm the theoretical predictions derived in  @xcite , but also show that the assumption that the two modes share the same spatial wave function is justified for a length of time sufficient to run the metrology scheme . for longer times , it becomes evident that the josephson hamiltonian  ( [ bechamil2 ] ) is unable to handle the full two - mode dynamics because it ignores entirely the spatial evolution of the condensate wave functions .    to get a more accurate description of the fringe signal",
    ", one needs to take into account the spatial differentiation of the wave functions of the two modes .",
    "we formulate an improved model that partially describes the differentiation of the wave functions by including a position - dependent phase shift across the condensate .",
    "this model , based on a one - dimensional thomas - fermi approximation , gives a considerably refined account of the fringe signal of our protocol .",
    "our analysis shows that as the number of atoms in the condensate approaches the critical atom number @xmath74 , deviations of the assumed product wave function from the numerically computed initial condensate wave function result in less accurate analytical estimates of the oscillation frequency of the fringe pattern .",
    "preliminary results indicate , however , that this effect can be described by means of perturbative techniques , which treat the scattering interaction as a perturbation to the single - particle transverse hamiltonian and which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the perturbation theory indicates that there should be corrections to the product wave function as well . for more hard - walled and flat - bottomed potentials",
    ", we find that corrections to our idealized models become less important , confirming that one should consider potentials such as boxes or rings as the preferred architectures for nonlinear bec metrology .",
