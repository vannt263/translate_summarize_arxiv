    "<S> we discuss the thermoelectrical properties of nanowires hosting majorana edge states . for a majorana nanowire </S>",
    "<S> directly coupled to two normal reservoirs the thermopower always vanishes regardeless of the value of the majorana hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> this situation changes drastically if we insert a quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> then , the dot majorana side coupled system exhibits a different behavior for the thermopower depending on the majorana hybridization parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thermopower reverses its sign when the half fermionic state is fully developed , i.e. , when @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath0 becomes finite the seebeck coefficient behaves similarly to a resonant level system . </S>",
    "<S> the sign change of the thermopower when majorana physics takes place and the fact that both , the electrical and thermal conductances reach , their half fermionic value could serve as a proof of the existence of majorana edge states in nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we perform some predictions about the gate dependence of the seebeck coefficient when kondo correlations are present in the dot . </S>"
