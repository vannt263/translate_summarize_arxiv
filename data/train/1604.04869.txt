    "topological insulators ( tis ) are notable materials currently attracting a wide interest in both fundamental and applied research@xcite .",
    "although tis show bulk insulating performance , they exhibit dirac - like gapless bands at their surfaces@xcite .",
    "the surface state is ensured by time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) and the spin polarization of the surface state electrons is locked to its momentum . because these properties are resistant to non - magnetic external perturbations , tis are expected to be promising materials for new spintronic devices@xcite .    by breaking trs , tis exhibit a number of interesting features , such as the gap - opening at the dirac point@xcite , the half quantum hall effect@xcite , the quantum anomalous hall effect @xcite , the topological magnetoelectric effect@xcite and the image magnetic monopole effect@xcite .",
    "there are two methods for breaking the trs ; one is by doping magnetic impurities ( cr , fe and mn)@xcite , and the other is by connecting tis to magnetic materials ( such as fe , co and eus)@xcite .",
    "however , with the objective of device applications , magnetic metals in contact with tis are not appropriate because the ti surface state is short circuited by the metallic material@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the curie temperatures ( @xmath6 ) of these tis that are doped by magnetic impurities or contacted with the magnetic insulator ( eus ) are typically below @xmath8  k and , therefore , raising @xmath6 is required for practical applications .    recently , it was suggested that a ferrimagnetic insulator , yttrium iron garnet ( yig , y@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 ) with @xmath6 @xmath9 @xmath10  k , has the potential to be an underlayer for magnetic ti films@xcite .",
    "it was reported , from magneto - transport and magneto - optical measurements , that @xmath6 of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/yig system reaches @xmath11  k  due to the proximity effect@xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath6 of cr - doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 on yig was found to be higher than that on a nonmagnetic substrate through magneto - transport and x - ray absorption magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) measurements@xcite .",
    "understanding the mechanism of the proximity effect between ti and yig is required to realize @xmath6 above room temperature ( rt ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we present results of angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) and xmcd for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 films on yig .",
    "we have successfully observed the ti surface state in this bi@xmath0se@xmath1/yig system and obtained direct evidence that the @xmath12 electrons of fe in yig induce the proximity effect at the interface between ti and yig .",

    "compared with the previous x - ray absorption study@xcite , the spectral features are likely assigned to the fe@xmath7 state in the yig crystal .",
    "these results indicate the existence of the fe@xmath7 state at the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/yig interface .",
    "the pre - edge peak ( h@xmath48  ev ) shows a positive xmcd signal and , thus , it is natural to assume that the fe@xmath7 possesses an opposite spin direction from the net magnetization of the yig crystal . it is intriguing to note that the pre - edge feature is seemingly suppressed in the x - ray absorption and xmcd spectra of the @xmath16  ql bi@xmath0se@xmath1 film at @xmath46  k. we infer that these fe@xmath7 states with the opposite spin direction may prevent the ferromagnetism of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 at the interface . while the interface fe@xmath7 state is considered to be related to the bi - fe or se - fe interaction at the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/yig junction , the proper assignment requires determination of the accurate interface atomic structure and appropriate theoretical calculations .      from the experimental results above ,",
    "ferromagnetism of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 at the interface would be associated with the interface spin - polarized states of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 film and localized spin states of the interface fe@xmath5 in the yig film .",

    "moreover , it was found that bulk ( @xmath50-orbital ) states of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 film also contribute to the spin - coupling between the ti and the ferromagnetic material when @xmath33 locates above the minimum of the bulk conduction band@xcite . by analogy",
    ", the ferromagnetism of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 at the interface can be understood as an exchange interaction between the spin - polarized electrons in the ( gapped ) dirac surface state of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 film and the localized @xmath12 electrons of the fe@xmath5 in the yig film@xcite .",
    "moreover , there is also a contribution from the bulk electrons in the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 film since the bulk conduction band crosses @xmath33 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ arpes ] ( d ) .",
    "in summary , in the present research , we provide the first evidence of the surface state of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 film on yig by arpes and the significance of the fe@xmath5 state for ferromagnetism of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 at the interface by fe @xmath51-edge xmcd .",
    "the origin of the proximity effect is likely described in terms of the exchange interaction between the localized fe@xmath5 3@xmath4 electrons in the yig film and the delocalized electrons of the surface state and the bulk state in the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 film .",
