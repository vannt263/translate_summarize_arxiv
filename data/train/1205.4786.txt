    "one recent observation in this field is that there generally occur two percolation transitions if the size of a given system expands exponentially fast as its length scale grows .",
    "for example , the size of a binary tree increases as @xmath3 with the number of layers @xmath4 [ fig .  [ fig : ebt](a ) ] . at the first percolation point",
    "@xmath5 , it becomes possible to establish a global connection , and the resulting cluster size scales linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "however , this cluster size is still negligible compared with @xmath6 since @xmath7 as @xmath4 increases .",
    "we find the largest cluster size @xmath8 comparable to @xmath6 only at @xmath9 , which determines @xmath10 .",
    "this tree in fact belongs to a category called hyperbolic lattices , obtained by tessellating a hyperbolic surface appearing in hyperbolic geometry . since such double percolation transitions in hyperbolic structures",
    "were revealed by numerical calculations  @xcite , there have been debates about locating the upper transition point  @xcite , particularly by dealing with a prototypical lattice model called the enhanced binary tree ( ebt ) .",
    "this structure is not a tree in itself , but is derived from the binary tree by connecting vertices on the same layer horizontally [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ebt](b ) ] .",
    "it thus describes spreading along a branching structure with possible horizontal transfer .",
    "while the duality relation implies @xmath11  @xcite , we have obtained @xmath12 by utilizing a simple extrapolation of the largest cluster size @xmath13 , which is correct for a tree  @xcite .",
    "this looks also consistent with the observation of @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the size of the second largest cluster  @xcite .",
    "we have even tried to explain this estimate @xmath16 analytically in combination with numerical observations and approximate renormalization - group methods  @xcite , pointing out that the duality argument does not have a solid mathematical ground here .         recently , ref .",

    "a notable point is that the slope of the line converges to a finite value , which clearly differs from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) results .",
    "this method yields @xmath32 for the ebt , questioning the validity of the claim that @xmath33 .",

    "@xcite , we pointed out that the transfer - matrix method performed better than the block - cell transformation .",
    "hence , we employ the transfer - matrix formalism developed for percolation in ref .  @xcite .",
    "first , we consider a unit cell of three spins as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tm](a ) .",
    "note that a bond on the bottom line has a different probability of @xmath95 from the others with @xmath35 . by attaching these cells from left to right ,",
    "we construct an indefinitely long strip , or a layer of width @xmath82 , which we can solve by using the transfer - matrix method .",
    "when we consider connection to the leftmost side , this cell has three possibilities : first , only the top point @xmath69 is connected ( case 1 ) , second , only @xmath67 is connected ( case 2 ) , or finally , both of them are connected ( case 3 ) .",
    "so we have nine possibilities of connection in total as follows : @xmath96 the global probability of connection to the leftmost side when @xmath97 blocks are attached will behave as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the largest eigenvalue of this @xmath100 matrix @xmath101 .",

    "this iteration therefore determines @xmath102 as a function of @xmath95 and @xmath35 , and we will find a limiting value @xmath103 for a large system .",
    "this renormalized connection probability is an increasing function of @xmath35 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tm](b ) ]",
    ". again , we are interested in the value of @xmath35 making @xmath104 , and such @xmath35 is found to be @xmath105 . in short , this confirms that @xmath91 is strictly below @xmath31 [ fig .",

    "[ fig : tm2](b ) . here",
    ", the black dots are connected to the leftmost side while the white dots are not .",
    "it is important to consider possibilities that two white dots may be connected to each other since a percolating path may go backward for a while , so such dots are represented by double circles . in fact , the case indexed as @xmath107 is not accessible from any other states so it can be discarded .",
    "each matrix element is expressed as a high - order polynomial , so the average number of terms per polynomial amounts to @xmath108 .",
    "it is merely a mechanical procedure to obtain the matrix elements so we show only the final result with the largest eigenvalue , which is identified with @xmath102 as above .",
    "the result shown in fig .  [ fig : tm2](c ) shows the highest lower bound of @xmath31 , which is around @xmath106 .",
    "it includes the numerical lower bound suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and the estimate based on the duality relation  @xcite .",
    "our calculation suggests that the slope at @xmath91 will converge to a finite value in the large-@xmath6 limit.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at the time of writing refs .",
    "@xcite , we assumed that the percolating properties in hyperbolic lattices could be inferred from known 2d results and also from the results of a tree .",
    "for example , @xmath14 has a diverging slope at the emergence of a giant cluster both for a 2d plane and for a tree .",
    "that is why we expected the same behavior for hyperbolic structures as well .",
    "however , as we see a clear difference from the 2d result in fig .",
    "[ fig : tre](b ) , such an assumption now looks quite dubious . based on the results so far obtained",
    ", it seems more plausible that this ratio also has a constant slope at the large-@xmath6 limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "this implies that percolation in the ebt is neither similar to its 2d counterpart nor to the percolation in a simple tree .",
    "in particular , we see that the competition between the largest and the second largest clusters appears milder than has been believed , so that @xmath14 may vanish smoothly around @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , it is inevitable to reconsider the phenomenological description of the critical phenomena around @xmath31 by using scaling collapse  @xcite since it is likely that the critical points in the hyperbolic lattices have been generally underestimated .",
    "our second example in sec .",
    "[ sec : solv ] , however , suggests that it can be difficult to extract the critical behavior if one solely relies on numerical data",
