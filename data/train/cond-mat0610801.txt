    "<S> the two - magnon problem for the frustrated xxz spin-@xmath0 heisenberg hamiltonian and external magnetic fields exceeding the saturation field @xmath1 is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the problem can be _ exactly _ mapped onto an effective tight - binding impurity problem . </S>",
    "<S> it allows to obtain explicit exact expressions for the two - magnon green s functions _ for arbitrary dimension and number of interactions_. we apply this theory to a quasi - one dimensional helimagnet with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor @xmath2 and antiferromagnetic next nearest neighbor @xmath3 interactions . </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding feature of the excitation spectrum is the existence of two - magnon bound states . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to deviations of the saturation field @xmath1 from its classical value @xmath4 which coincides with the one - magnon instability . for the refined frustration ratio @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> the minimum of the two - magnon spectrum occurs at the boundary of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> based on the two - magnon approach , we propose general analytic expressions for the saturation field @xmath1 , confirming known previous results for one - dimensional isotropic systems , but explore also the role of interchain and long - ranged intrachain interactions as well as of the exchange anisotropy . </S>"
