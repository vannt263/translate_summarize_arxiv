    "since the discovery of the high  temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , many theoretical investigations have been focused on the study of the doping evolution from the antiferromagnetically ordered mott insulator to the bcs - type superconductor . it is commonly assumed that this evolution is the key ingredient for the understanding of the physics behind high  temperature superconductivity and it can adequately be addressed in terms of the two  dimensional ( @xmath8 ) @xmath0-@xmath1 lattice model . this model is believed to capture the essential low - energy physics of doped mott insulators driven by strong electron correlations .",
    "although , it is generally accepted that strong electron correlations play an important role close to half filling , it remains unclear to what extent htsc can be described entirely in terms of this minimal electronic model .",
    "one of the reasons for this lack of clarity is that , despite its simplicity , the exact properties of the @xmath9 model , apart from a few limiting cases , are still unknown .",
    "the vast majority of the results away from half filling have been obtained for one or two holes introduced into the af background .",
    "this problem has been thoroughly analyzed with the help of various analytical and numerical approaches @xcite .",
    "results for larger dopings are less comprehensive . here , one of the important problems concerns the robustness of the af order against doping .",
    "most of the theoretical approaches predict , that the long range af order persists up to much larger dopings than observed in cuprates @xcite .",
    "it has recently been suggested that including into consideration the nearest neighbour hopping may help in resolving this discrepancy @xcite .",
    "however , a reliable and well controlled analytical treatment of the isotropic @xmath0@xmath1 model poses a severe technical problem : it is very hard to analytically deal with the local no double occupancy ( ndo ) constraint . on the other hand , because of this constraint , numerical treatment is available only on rather small lattice clusters , which immediately rises the problem of the finite - size effects and , consequently , of the thermodynamical stability of the results obtained .",
    "an interesting question then arises : is there available a modification of the isotropic @xmath9 model that allows for unbiased numerical treatment and at the same time captures the essential properties of the original @xmath9 model at least for a certain parameter range ? some of the computational difficulties related with the @xmath0@xmath1 model may be overcome by means of investigations of its anisotropic limit , i.e. , the @xmath0@xmath3 model .",
    "numerical work has suggested that the @xmath9 and @xmath10 models have many similar properties @xcite . in particular , the stripes , pairing , and nagaoka states found in the @xmath10 model are very similar to those of the isotropic @xmath9 model @xcite . in general , despite some significant differences between both the models @xcite , at the low - energy scale of order @xmath11 it is reasonable to consider the background spin configuration to be frozen with respect to the hole dynamics time scale . in this case",
    "the properties of the low - energy quasiparticle excitations in the @xmath9 model are at least qualitatively similar to those in the anisotropic @xmath10 model .",
    "although this model is more amenable to numerical calculations , again only rather small lattice clusters are allowed .",
    "one may hope that the full ising version of the @xmath9 model in which the @xmath0-term possesses the global discrete @xmath12 spin symmetry rather than the su(2 ) one results in a more tractable though still nontrivial model .",
    "however , it is not clear how such a model can be derived directly in terms of the gutzwiller projected lattice electron operators , since those operators transform themselves in a fundamental representation of su(2 ) . in this paper we use the recently proposed doped - particle representation of the projected electron operators to derive the full ising version of the @xmath9 model .",
    "we believe that the results of our study capture some essential low - energy properties of the isotropic @xmath9 model since the strongly correlated nature of the problem is preserved .    the doped - particle representation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is especially suited for investigations of the underdoped regime @xcite .",
    "some crucial points of this approach are recalled at the beginning of the following section .",
    "although this is a slave  particle formulation , it differs from other similar approaches in that the ndo constraint is identically fulfilled at half  filling .",
    "since the holes are the only charge degrees of freedom present in the system , the number of charge carriers is very small close to half - filling .",
    "therefore , this approach is particularly useful for the description of the underdoped regime , whereas its applicability to the description of strongly overdoped cuprates is much more involved .    until now",
    ", the doped particle representation has been analyzed only within mean  field approximations @xcite .",
    "our aim is to go beyond this approximation in such a way , that the slave  particle constraint is exactly taken into account .",
    "we demonstrate that this can be achieved for very large clusters of the order of @xmath7 lattice sites , provided the su(2 ) symmetry is broken down to @xmath12 not only in the spin ",
    "spin interaction term but also in the hopping term .",
    "since the effectiveness of the resulting calculations is independent of the translational invariance , this approach also allows one to investigate the role of inhomogeneities which are expected to play an important role in the cuprate compounds @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes in detail the derivation of the theoretical model .",
    "section 3 comprises the results of the numerical calculations .",
    "section 4 lists our conclusions .",
    "we start with the @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian on a square lattice @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the projected electron operator ( to exclude the on - site double occupancy ) , @xmath15 is the electron spin operator and @xmath16 .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ 2.1 ] ) contains a kinetic term with the hopping integrals @xmath17 and a potential @xmath1 describing the strength of the nearest neighbour spin exchange interaction . at every lattice site",
    "the gutzwiller projection operator @xmath18 projects out the doubly occupied states @xmath19 thereby reducing the quantum hilbert space to a product of @xmath20-dimensional spaces spanned by the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 physically this modification of the original hilbert space results in strong electron correlation effects . the crucial local no double occupancy constraint is rigorously incorporated into eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "however , this is achieved at the expense of introducing the constrained electron operators , @xmath23 , that obey much more complicated commutation relations than the conventional `` unconstrained '' fermion operators .",
    "it should be stressed that it is precisely close to half filling where the gutzwiller projection is of a crucial importance : the projected electron operator @xmath24 in this regime significantly differs from the bare electron operator @xmath25 ( right at half filling @xmath26 ) .",
    "a natural question then arises : is it possible to rewrite the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian in terms of the conventional fermion and spin operators in such a way that the ndo constraint for the lattice electrons transforms itself into the one that can be treated , close to half filling , in a controlled way ?",
    "recently , it has been shown that the @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian can indeed be represented in that form @xcite .",
    "for the reader s convenience we sketch below the main points of this scheme . the basic idea behind this approach is to assign fermion operators to doped carriers ( holes , for example ) rather than to the lattice electrons .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian is expressed then in terms of the lattice spin operators , @xmath27 , and doped carrier operators represented by spin-@xmath28 charged fermions , @xmath29 .    to accommodate these new operators",
    "one obviously needs to enlarge the original onsite hilbert space of quantum states .",
    "this enlarged space is characterized by the state vectors @xmath30 with @xmath31 labeling the spin projection of the lattice spins and @xmath32 labeling the dopon states ( double occupancy is not allowed ) . in this way the enlarged hilbert space becomes @xmath33 while in the original hilbert space we can either have one electron with spin @xmath34 or a vacancy : @xmath35 the following mapping between the two spaces is then defined @xcite : @xmath36 the remaining states in the enlarged hilbert space , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are unphysical and should therefore be removed in actual calculations . in this mapping , a vacancy in the electronic system corresponds to a singlet pair of a lattice spin and a dopon , whereas the presence of an electron is related to the absence of a dopon .",
    "dopon representation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian then reads @xcite @xmath40 , \\label{tj1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath41 being a projected dopon operator and @xmath42 .",
    "the application of @xmath43 in this form should be accompanied by the implementation of the constraint to eliminate the unphysical states , @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for the dopon spin operator so that @xmath46 note the important factor of @xmath47 in front of the first term in eq .",
    "( [ tj1 ] ) .",
    "it originates from the fact that the vacancies are represented in this theory by the spin - dopon singlets given by eq .",
    "( [ vacancy ] ) .",
    "the projected lattice electron operators can be explicitly expressed in terms of the projected dopon operators .",
    "for example , @xmath48 , \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the projection operator which eliminates the unphysical states from the @xmath50 site .",
    "the above representation of the @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian is particularly useful for the description of strongly underdoped cuprates .",
    "close to half filling @xmath51 , so that one can safely drop the tilde sign off the projected dopon operators .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the low doping regime the probability for the realization of a doubly occupied dopon state is indeed very low . despite that , the ndo constraint ( [ 2.3 ] ) must be imposed to eliminate the unphysical degrees of freedom that are present in this formalism at any finite doping .",
    "note , however , that at half  filling the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2.3 ] ) vanishes , and thus , in contrast to the original ndo constraint for the lattice electrons , this equation turns into a trivial identity .",
    "right at half filling reads @xmath52 . ] additionally , in this regime one can neglect both the hole ",
    "hole interactions represented by the @xmath53 term , and the @xmath54 couplings . note also that the insulating phase in this representation is directly associated with the absence of charged particles .",
    "so far , the doped  particle representation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model has been analyzed only within the mean  field approximations @xcite .",
    "our aim is to go beyond the mean  field analysis and to carry out calculations for large enough systems , to make sure that the finite  size effects are truly negligible .",
    "let us start with the anisotropic limiting case of the @xmath0@xmath1 model with the spins polarized only along the z - component , namely , the @xmath0@xmath3 model .",
    "this model is of interest in itself since it captures some essential physics of strong electron correlations .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath3 model can be considered as a limiting case of the @xmath0@xmath1 model ( [ 2.1 ] ) which has an ising rather than a heisenberg spin interaction : @xmath56 here @xmath57 represent the gutzwiller - projected electron operators .",
    "the global continuous spin su(2 ) symmetry of the @xmath0@xmath1 model now reduces to the global discrete @xmath12 symmetry of the @xmath0@xmath3 model .",
    "although @xmath58 interaction possesses discrete @xmath12 symmetry , the original su(2 ) symmetry of all other terms of the hamiltonian is preserved .",
    "therefore , the symmetry of the @xmath0@xmath3 model depends on whether @xmath3 is zero or finite .",
    "namely , for @xmath59 the su(2 ) symmetry is restored again .",
    "in contrast , in the full @xmath9 model both the @xmath0- and @xmath1-terms possess the same su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "it is therefore natural to seek for a representation of the full ising version of the @xmath9 model in which the symmetry of the model does not depend on the values of the model parameters .",
    "such a representation can straightforwardly be derived within the dopant  particle formulation of the @xmath0@xmath1 model .",
    "the physical consequences as well as computational advantages of such an approach will be discussed in the subsequent sections .    to proceed , we start right from the original @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian described in terms of the lattice electrons given by eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) , where we now put @xmath60 at the operator level .",
    "we then have for the physical electron projected operators : @xmath61 where the projection operator now reads @xmath62 .",
    "it can easily be checked that @xmath63 the kinetic @xmath0-term built out of the physical electron operators given by eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) possesses the global @xmath12 symmetry rather than the su(2 ) one .",
    "accordingly , the underlying onsite hilbert space rearranges itself in the following way .",
    "the operators @xmath64 act on the hilbert space @xmath65 .",
    "these operators do not mix up any other states .",
    "operator @xmath66 destroys the spin - down electron and creates a vacancy .",
    "this vacancy is described by the state @xmath67 .",
    "the similar consideration holds for the @xmath68 operators .",
    "now , however , the vacancy is described by the state @xmath69 .",
    "those two vacancy states are related by the @xmath12 transformation .",
    "the operator @xmath70 produces zero upon acting on the both .",
    "the physical hilbert state is therefore a direct sum @xmath71 under the @xmath12 transformation @xmath72 we get @xmath73 , which results in @xmath74.@xmath1 model these two @xmath8 spaces merge into a @xmath75 su(2 ) invariant physical space , where the vacancy is just an antisymmetric linear combination given by the su(2 ) spin singlet  ( 5 ) .",
    "the symmetric combination splits off , since it represents an unphysical spin - triplet state . ]    as a result , one arrives at the representation ( [ z1 ] ) in which , however , the electron projection operators are given by eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "all the parts of this hamiltonian possess the global discrete @xmath12 symmetry whereas the global continuous su(2 ) symmetry is completely lost .",
    "close to half  filling this hamiltonian reduces to the form , @xmath76 , \\label{tj2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which should be accompanied by the constraint , @xmath77 in order to emphasize the difference between the @xmath0@xmath3 and the present model we dub the latter the ising @xmath9 or for short the @xmath78 model .",
    "the factor of @xmath47 which is presented in the hopping term of the isotropic @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian ( [ tj1 ] ) drops out from the hopping term in the ising @xmath9 hamiltonian .",
    "this occurs because of the fact that the equations @xmath79 which are valid for both the @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath3 models , are in the @xmath78 model replaced by the following ones , @xmath80    in practical calculations , the ndo constraint ( [ 2.31 ] ) can be taken into account with the help of a lagrange multiplier . in order to do",
    "that we introduce an additional term to the hamiltonian , @xmath81 .",
    "\\label{constr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the operator @xmath82 produces eigenvalues 0 and 1 , when acting on the onsite physical and unphysical states , respectively .",
    "because of this , the global lagrange multiplier @xmath83 enforces the ndo constraint locally . the double dopon occupancy of an arbitrary site results in an appearance of an unphysical state and hence enhances the total energy by @xmath84",
    ". therefore , in the large-@xmath84 limit all unphysical states are automatically eliminated and we can in this limit safely remove the tilde sign off the @xmath85 operators . in the following section we show that this constraint is of crucial importance for the description of the af order at finite doping .",
    "the total hamiltonian takes the form @xmath86 with @xmath87 , \\label{jz2 } \\\\",

    "we have neglected the hole ",
    "hole interaction in @xmath90 , which is perfectly justified in the low doping regime .",
    "in order to verify this approximation we have carried out additional calculations with the hole - hole interaction being taken into account in the mean  field approximation .",
    "the difference is negligible and therefore we do not present them here .",
    "note , that the interaction strength in @xmath91 is exactly the same as in the standard formulation of the @xmath0@xmath1 model .",
    "absence of any renormalization of the model parameters originates from the fact that the projection procedure is explicitly built in eq .",
    "( [ jz1 ] ) , provided @xmath92 . despite its complexity , with the monte carlo ( mc ) method , one can investigate the hamiltonian ( [ jz1 ] ) for very large systems without any approximation .",
    "since @xmath93=0 $ ] the spin degrees of freedom can be analyzed within the classical metropolis algorithm . however , since the effective hamiltonian ( [ jz1 ] ) includes both fermionic as well as classical degrees of freedom , this algorithm needs to be modified .",
    "the procedure is as follows :    1 .",
    "an initial configuration of @xmath94 is generated ; 2 .",
    "the hamiltonians ( [ jz2 ] , [ jz3 ] ) are diagonalized and the free energy @xmath95 of the fermionic subsystem in the canonical ensemble is determined ; 3 .",
    "two sites with opposite spins @xmath96 are randomly chosen ; then , both the spins are flipped ; 4 .",
    "step ( ii ) is repeated , determining new value of the free energy @xmath97 ; 5 .",

    "it is the metropolis algorithm , but with the internal energy in statistical weights replaced by the free energy of the fermionic subsystem .",
    "a detailed description of this approach can be found in ref .",
    "concurrently with the mc simulation an iterate procedure calculating the distribution of holes is carried out in a self  consistent way .",
    "most of the numerical results have been obtained for a @xmath102 systems with periodic boundary conditions . however , in order to check the influence of finite  size effects we have carried out calculations on clusters of up to 1600 lattice sites and with averaging over the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this problem is discussed at the end of the next section .    in order to eliminate the unphysical states in the monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we have taken @xmath103 .",

    "similar situation occurs in the @xmath0@xmath3 model , but it is not the case for the @xmath9 one , where the the spin  flip term can undo the defects generated by a moving hole and hence it allows for its much higher mobility . in the present approach holes become mobile when doping increases , i.e. , when the af background disappears . the onset of mobile holes is accomplished through a gradual transfer of the spectral weight from the vicinity of the almost localized level . close to half  filling the most significant transfer takes place in states with @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "however , even for relatively large doping the spectral functions remain broad for all the momenta .    for non ",
    "zero @xmath144 and @xmath145 there are mobile holes even for small doping , but the spectral functions still remain very broad . also in this case , doping is responsible for significant modification of the dispersion relation of holes . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we compare @xmath155 calculated for @xmath156 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 . along with the destruction of the af lro , there is an increasing contribution of nearest neighbour hopping to the hole kinetic energy .",
    "for @xmath157 the peaks in spectral functions can be fitted by the dispersion relation with @xmath158 , whereas for @xmath159 the af correlations hardly influence the nearest neighbour hopping .",
    "note that such a substantial modification of the dispersion relation may change the topology of the fermi surface .",
    "doping affects not only the effective dispersion relation , but also frustrates the af background .",
    "the latter effect is responsible for strong broadening of the spectral functions that is visible in fig .",
    "comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig6 ] demonstrates that the mobility of holes and destruction of the af lro are mutually connected with each other in the sense that mobility affects af lro and , _ vice versa _",
    ", af order affects the mobility of holes .",
    "we now turn our attention to the temperature dependence of the spin ",
    "spin correlation function and the spectral properties of holes .",
    "it is known that the nel temperature drops rapidly when the parent compounds of the high  temperature superconductors are doped with holes .",
    "similar behaviour can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where temperature dependence of @xmath110 is presented for different doping levels .",
    "one can note that doping strongly reduces the lro , whereas its influence on the sro is much weaker .",
    "in particular , the nearest neighbour correlation functions @xmath160 calculated for @xmath157 and @xmath161 are qualitatively and quantitatively close to each other .",
    "these results suggest that , the af sro should be observed in a wide range of temperatures and dopings , much beyond the boundaries of the af phase .",
    "it remains in agreement with recent experiments on high  temperature superconductors suggesting that with doping , the long - range nel order gives way to short - range order with a progressively shorter correlation length . as a result , at optimal doping",
    "the static spin correlation length is no more than two or three lattice spacing @xcite .     as a function of temperature for @xmath135 and @xmath157 ( upper panel ) and @xmath161 ( lower panel ) .",

    "@xmath140 have been assumed.,width=321 ]    the discussed above correlation function and the spin  structure factor describe the background composed of the localized spins , which , as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs , is up to some degree affected by the motion of doped holes .",
    "therefore , the reduction of the antiferromagnetic correlations has to be observed also in the dynamics of the carriers .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where we demonstrate the temperature dependence of the spectral functions . when the temperature increases , the number of spin defects in the nel state increases as well , and this enables the nearest neighbour hopping , thereby allowing holes to lower their kinetic energy .",
    "this mechanism leads to trapping of holes in the regions of broken antiferromagnetic bonds and forming ferromagnetic spin polarons , where the hole hopping does not frustrate the spin background .",
    "the contribution of the nearest neighbour hopping becomes visible in the spectral functions , where the increase of the temperature causes a significant broadening of the spectral lines .",
    "similarly to the spectral functions obtained for a single hole in the @xmath0@xmath144@xmath145@xmath1 model @xcite , the width of the peaks in the @xmath155 is too small , when compared to the results of the angle  resolved spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements @xcite on sr@xmath164cuo@xmath164cl@xmath164 .",
    "it has recently been argued , that strong electron ",
    "phonon interaction @xcite may explain the very broad peaks observed in the insulating copper oxides @xcite .    in the present approach ,",
    "holes interact with spins through the intersite interaction of strength @xmath1 as well as through the onsite constraint with the lagrange multiplier @xmath84 , and both of these interactions can be responsible for the destruction of the af lro . in order to determine the underlying mechanism we have carried out simulations taking into account one of these interactions at a time .",
    "the results shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] clearly demonstrate that the constraint plays the dominating role in the destruction of the af state .",
    "when both these interactions are taken into account the lro is completely destroyed and only af sro can be observed for @xmath165 . however ,",
    "if we ignore the constraint lro is restored .",
    "the results obtained without the intersite spin  hole interaction ( @xmath166 terms ) are almost indistinguishable from the ones obtained with both the interactions .",
    "note , that for @xmath167 the ndo constraint is completely neglected .",
    "this illustrates the importance of the constraint for a realistic description of the af order at finite doping .",
    "additionally , in order to determine the value of the lagrange multiplier for which the results converge and the ndo constraint is fulfilled we have calculated @xmath110 for a wide range of @xmath84 . the results are presented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "one can see that the assumed value @xmath103 is large enough to enforce the constraint . after explaining the role of the farther neighbour hopping we",
    "restrict the following analysis to the case of @xmath139 and @xmath140 .     for @xmath168 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "in the upper panel the topmost curve has been calculated with @xmath167 .",
    "the other curves show results obtained for @xmath103 with and without the spin  hole exchange interaction .",
    "the lower panel shows @xmath110 for different values of @xmath84 .",
    "note , that the results for @xmath103 and @xmath169 are almost indistinguishable.,width=302 ]      since our method works for systems with broken translational invariance , it is tempting to apply it as well to inhomogeneous systems .",
    "it has recently been shown with the help of scanning tunneling spectroscopy that nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity is an inherent feature of many groups of high  temperature superconductors . by a direct probing of the local density of states ,",
    "these methods reveal strong spatial modulation of the energy gap in the superconducting bi  based compounds @xcite .",
    "very recently , stm experiments have shown a strong correlation between position of the dopant atoms and all manifestations of the nanoscale electronic disorder @xcite .",
    "thus , these experiments proved essentially that the impurities were the source of the inhomogeneity . on the other hand",
    ", they revealed a very important feature : there is a _ positive _ correlation between the magnitude of a gap and the position of an out  of  plane oxygen atoms @xcite .",
    "these are the atoms which have been doped into the insulating parent compound in order to introduce holes to the cuo@xmath164 planes .",
    "impurity correlation has been explained as a result of the inhomogeneity  enhanced exchange interaction in the @xmath0@xmath1 model @xcite . assuming that purely electronic models contain the essential physics of cuprates , the same interaction is responsible for both superconductivity and the af order .",
    "therefore , inhomogeneity may affect the af state as well .",
    "additionally , localization of holes by the electrostatic potential of out  of  plane oxygen atoms may also affect the af order , since the hopping of holes frustrates the af lro . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the role played by these mechanisms in the strongly underdoped regime . in order to investigate the latter one",
    ", we extend the hamiltonian ( [ jz1 ] ) by adding a term responsible for inhomogeneity  induced diagonal disorder @xmath170 where @xmath171 _ i=\\ {    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     .",
    "@xmath171 in contrast with the superconducting gap @xcite , the af order is hardly modified by this mechanism .",
    "this can be clearly inferred from the lower panel in fig .",
    "the regime for a magnetic ordering predicted by many calculations in the @xmath0@xmath1 model extends to much larger dopings than observed in cuprates and this discrepancy is sometimes attributed to the inhomogeneities , which are neglected in many theoretical approaches ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "although , inhomogeneities are expected to play an important role in high  temperature superconductors @xcite , our results indicate that their influence in the af ordering is rather limited . in particular , we expect that the inhomogeneities introduced by the out  of  plane oxygen atoms can not explain the above discrepancy .",
    "since our analysis has been carried out on finite clusters , it is necessary to check to what extent the results are affected by the finite size effects .",
    "one of the measures of the significance of the finite size effects is a sensitivity to the boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the correlation functions and the spectral functions for systems with different boundary conditions and compared them to those which have been obtained with periodic boundary conditions . here , we have used a method known as averaging over boundary conditions ( abc ) @xcite . each time a particular hole jumps out of the cluster , it is mapped back into the cluster with wave function with a different phase .",
    "then the results are averaged over these phases ; thereby the reciprocal space is probed in a much greater number of points than in the case of periodic boundary conditions . in our simulations",
    "we have used a slightly modified version , where the phases were chosen randomly in each monte carlo step .",
    "the averaging over the boundary conditions has been carried out concurrently with averaging over the ensemble generated in monte carlo run @xcite . this way it does not require an additional computational effort .",
    "another more direct way to check the influence of the finite size effects is to compare results obtained on clusters of different sizes . in order to do so",
    ", we have repeated some calculations on 40@xmath17240 cluster .",
    "[ fse1 ] shows a comparison of spectral functions obtained for 20@xmath17220 and 40@xmath17240 clusters with periodic boundary conditions as well as for 20@xmath17220 cluster with abc .",
    "since the false  colour plots of these spectral functions are very similar to each other , we present their energy dependence for a few selected points of the brillouin zone .    20 ( solid line ) and 40@xmath17240 (",
    "dashed line ) clusters with periodic boundary conditions and on 20@xmath17220 cluster with abc ( dotted line ) .",
    "since the positions of the coherent peaks obtained with help of these three approaches are almost indistinguishable , we have cut the vertical axis in such a way that the incoherent parts are more pronounced .",
    "these results have been obtained for @xmath135 , @xmath134 , and @xmath157.,width=302 ]    one can see from this figure that the coherent part of the spectral functions is almost exactly the same in these three cases . the low ",
    "intensity parts also look very similar , thought some differences can be seen .",
    "another quantity we have used to analyze the finite size effects is the correlation function @xmath110 .",
    "[ fse2 ] shows @xmath110 determined for the same three systems , for which the spectral functions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fse1 ] .     for the same systems as in fig .",
    "also , the same parameters have been used .",
    "the insets show examples of snapshots of the spin configurations for 40@xmath17240 and 20@xmath17220 clusters [ black ( white ) square corresponds to @xmath173 ( @xmath174.,width=302 ]    despite minor quantitative differences the overall character of all three correlation functions is the same .",
    "though we have not carried out a systematic finite size scaling , the similarity of both the spectral functions and the correlation functions constitutes a significant indication that our results are valid also in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have developed a doped - carrier representation of the ising @xmath0@xmath1 model . in this formulation ,",
    "the system is described in terms of fermions interacting with static localized spins .",
    "although it is a slave  particle approach , in contrast with many similar approaches , the local ndo constraint is taken into account exactly .",
    "the proposed hamiltonian has the global @xmath12 symmetry at any values of the parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this model is of an interest in itself since it represents a simple though nontrivial electron system which captures the physics of strong electron correlations .",
    "the issue of how these correlations affect the magnetic ordering of the lattice spins is thouroughly investigated in the present work . besides",
    ", this model may provide at least for some values of the model parameters a guess supported by unbiased numerical calculations regarding the actual low - energy behaviour of the quasiparticle excitations in a more realistic isotropic @xmath9 model .",
    "in particular , we have calculated the one  hole energy and compared our results with those obtained for @xmath0@xmath3 and @xmath0@xmath1 models .",
    "we have found that the one  hole energy is the same as in the @xmath0@xmath3 model in two limiting cases , @xmath175 and @xmath176 . for intermediate @xmath1",
    "the one  hole energy obtained for the @xmath0@xmath1 model is in between the results obtained for @xmath0@xmath3 and @xmath78 approaches and the differences between @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath3 models are comparable to those between @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath78 ones .",
    "the main advantage of the present approach consists in that it can be applied for very large systems and the computational effort increases much slower with the size of the system than , e.g. , for exact diagonalization .",
    "moreover , it works for arbitrary value of the coupling @xmath1 and for arbitrary doping level .",
    "in particular , in the small@xmath1 regime the exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo methods give rather poor results .",
    "this is because of the fact that in this regime the size of the defects generated by moving holes is comparable to or larger than the size of cluster the calculations can be carried on . since the clusters in our approach are much larger , this problem is less significant",
    ". additionally , our method does not require translational invariance of the system .",
    "this feature is especially important in the context of the recent experimental results , which clearly indicate the presence of inhomogeneities in curates .",
    "it could also be applicable to optical lattices , where the translational symmetry is broken by a trap .    using the proposed approach we have found that the af sro persists for temperatures and dopings which are much beyond the boundaries of the af lro phase , what is in agreement with recent experiments on the high  temperature superconductors .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the af lro depends on the exchange interaction @xmath1 .",
    "it concerns the transition temperature as well as the maximal doping at which the af lro vanishes .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that the local no double occupancy constraint plays the dominant role in destroying the magnetic order at finite doping .",
    "finally , we have shown that the inhomogeneities induced by the out  of  plane oxygen atoms have a rather limited influence on the spin ",
    "spin correlations functions , at least in the underdoped regime .",
    "although , localization of holes by their electrostatic potential stabilizes the af lro , this mechanism becomes important only for a relatively strong diagonal disorder .",
    "such a limited influence of inhomogeneities on the af order is closely related with the ndo constraint .",
    "note that exactly at half filling the diagonal disorder does not influence the system , provided the ndo is properly taken into account .",
