    "when @xmath0 is attractive , in the literature there have been at least two systematic proposals to select the coefficients @xmath47 s in , leading to sliding vector fields of flilippov type on @xmath0 : the _ bilinear _ and the _ moments _ vector fields .",
    "the former has been extensively studied , see @xcite for example , and it consists in choosing the sliding vector field in the form @xmath48+\\alpha[(1-\\beta)f_3+\\beta f_4]\\ , \\\\ ( \\alpha,\\beta ) : & \\ ,   \\begin{bmatrix } w^1_1 & w^1_2 & w^1_3 & w^1_4 \\\\ w^2_1 & w^2_2 & w^2_3 & w^2_4 \\end{bmatrix } \\begin{bmatrix } ( 1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta ) \\\\ ( 1-\\alpha)\\beta \\\\ \\alpha(1-\\beta ) \\\\",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the moments method has been recently introduced in @xcite and consists in solving the linear system in , by appending to it the extra relation @xmath49 the two choices above generally lead to distinct solution trajectories , a chief difference between them being the behavior of the bilinear and moments trajectories at so - called _ generic tangential exit points_. these were introduced in @xcite , and are values of @xmath13 , where one ( and just one ) of the sliding vector fields on @xmath50 or @xmath51 is itself tangent to @xmath0 ( _ exit vector field _ ) .",
    "the moments vector field automatically aligns with the exit vector field , whereas the bilinear vector field does not .    an important question , and one which we will try to answer in this work is : what should happen to trajectories of in a neighborhood of @xmath0 , when @xmath0 loses attractivity ( according to generic first order exit conditions ) ?",
    "if _ natura non facit saltum _ , then is either a description of an innatural system or a wrong model .",
    "probably , whenever it is set forth , it is neither innatural nor wrong , though it may be a little of both things , perhaps because the model should be complemented by some missing information ( the 20 years old exposition of seidman in @xcite is still worthwhile reading ) .",
    "regardless , the above 18th century motto suggests considering a regularized version of , by replacing it with a smooth differential system . of course",
    ", we must assume that we do not have knowledge of where comes from , if from anywhere at all , otherwise we should surely use this knowledge .",
    "however , in the absence of further insight , it is not obvious how one should globally regularize the system , and several possibilities for globally regularizing the system have been proposed in the literature .",
    "arguably , the most studied regularization techniques are what we may call the `` singular perturbation '' and `` sigmoid blending '' techniques .",
    "the paper @xcite was the first seminal work on the singular perturbation approach , followed by the more recent works @xcite , as well as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and , in the context of gene regulatory networks , @xcite .",
    "the first systematic exposition of blending was the beautiful work @xcite .",
    "but , in the end , these techniques are all rather similar and amount to a regularization of the bilinear vector field .",
    "this can be done locally , just in a neighborhood of @xmath0 , say using a cutoff function ( as we do in section [ br_section ] ) , or more globally , perhaps through use of hyperbolic @xmath52 functions to connect different vector fields .    in this work , we are exclusively concerned with local regularizations , hence those that alter the given problem only in a neighborhood of @xmath0 . in this case ,",
    "the above mentioned regularization proposals share some common traits , the most important ones being that , outside of a neighborhood of @xmath0 , the regularized vector field effectively reduces to the original vector fields , and that the regularization depends on a small parameter ( or several small parameters ) in such a way that as the parameter(s ) go to @xmath53 , the neigborhood collapses onto @xmath0 .",
    "the first fact is surely a reasonable property , since , away from @xmath0 , there is a well defined smooth vector field depending on where the trajectory is , be it one of the original @xmath54 or one of the filippov sliding vector fields on the surfaces @xmath55 .",
    "the second fact may be a bit more controversial , since the regularized trajectory will typically select a specific sliding motion on @xmath0 ( when @xmath0 is attractive ) , as the neighborhood collapses onto @xmath0 ; however , as it is well understood , and as we will also see , different regularizations do behave differently . as noted by utkin ( @xcite ) ,",
    "given that in a neighborhood of @xmath0 there are non - unique dynamics , the inherited dynamics on @xmath0 ( sliding motion ) does depend on the choice of regularization .",
    "but , this being the case , is there an appropriate way to evaluate different regularizations ? to answer this question , we must first decide how we should evaluate dynamics .",
    "the first observation is that when we evaluate the dynamics of we should distinguish between the two cases ( i ) and ( ii ) below .    *",
    "the pws smooth system is just a `` convenient '' formalism : there is a `` true '' smooth system , defined globally , but it is simpler to replace it by a pws one .",
    "for example , this is the case for problems arising in gene regulatory networks ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in these cases",
    ", one knows what is the desired behavior in a neighborhood of @xmath0 : it is the behavior of the original problem !",
    "however , one must be careful in replacing the true system by , since it is not clear that the dynamics of the purely pws system reflect the dynamics of the original problem ; this was already noted in works such as @xcite and @xcite relative to a discontinuity surface of co - dimension 1 .",
    "but , does nt this discrepancy mean that representing the original problem as a pws one was not an appropriate modeling simplification in the first place ? * the problem arises as piecewise smooth problem , or we do not have sufficient knowledge of an underlying `` true '' problem ( if any ) ; for example , in bang - bang control , or in dry friction models . in our opinion , in these cases when there is no ( knowledge of an ) underlying `` true '' dynamics that one is trying to recover , the choices we make must be consistent with the pws formulation .",
    "this is the case in which we are interested .",
    "the above consideration ( ii ) leads us to restrict to the model as * the system * we are given and it is this system that we will study .",
    "this realization motivates us ( and it has motivated us for several years ) to look at the global properties of the discontinuity surface , and to decide on what is appropriate based on whether or not the surface attracts the dynamics of the pws system for initial conditions off the discontinuity surface itself . in our opinion , it is not easy to justify studying by assuming a specific form of an underlying system from where arises as some form of limiting process . in other words , whereas it is surely legitimate ( and by no means trivial ) to study the limiting behavior of a specific choice of regularized vector field defined in a neighborhood of @xmath0 , this may actually have a restricted scope of applicability compared to .",
    "as already noted by utkin ( see @xcite ) , once one has replaced with a smoothed version of it , the stability of sliding motion on @xmath0 is inherited by that of the dynamics of the regularized field .",
    "but , is this consistent with the formulation ?    for the given pws system , we believe that it is its dynamics near the discontinuity manifold that determines the appropriate behavior of a trajectory . this dynamics is what we will try to capture in this work .",
    "moreover , our main interest is in the case when the discontinuity manifold transitions from being attractive to not attractive for the trajectories of the original discontinuous system : in this case , will ( or should ) a trajectory ( even an ideal trajectory , sliding on the manifold ) feel this loss of attractivity , and hence leave a neighborhood of @xmath0 ?    therefore , without assuming any form of idealized motion on @xmath0 , we can reformulate our main task as follows :     _ `` how should we evaluate the dynamics of in a neighborhood of @xmath0 ? '' _    in principle , one may want to do this by studying the dynamics of a regularized problem , and we have already mentioned some possibilities , such as sigmoid blending and singular perturbation techniques .",
    "e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "we emphasize once more that these choices ( as noted by alexander and seidman for blending , and by teixeira et alia .",
    "for singular parturbation ) remove the ambiguity of how sliding on @xmath0 occurs , but these choices are effectively modeling assumptions , and we should ask if they render a behavior of the dynamics on @xmath0 that is consistent with that of .",
    "other possibilities have also been set forth in the literature , see @xcite for further references .",
    "* euler broken line approximation .",
    "this is simple to do , and it consists in replacing by a euler method approximation with constant stepsize , call it @xmath56 .",
    "we have experimented extensively with this technique , see below . [",
    "the eventuality , of probability 0 , that an euler iterate lands exactly on a discontinuity surface can be handled in different ways ; e.g. , by randomly selecting one of the neighboring vector fields , or by retaining the last vector field used . ] * hysteresis ( or delay ) approximation .",
    "this approach appears in @xcite for a surface of co - dimension 1 . for the case of @xmath0 of co -",
    "dimension 2 , it has been studied first in @xcite and then in @xcite , always in the case of nodally attractive @xmath0 .",
    "the idea here is that one has a region @xmath57 around @xmath0 ( called a chatterbox in @xcite ) , and uses the same vector field , say @xmath35 , not only in the region @xmath31 , but until the boundary of @xmath57 in a different region is reached ; at that point , a switch to the appropriate vector field in the new region is performed .",
    "the rationale for this approach is that one does not notice immediately that a discontinuity surface is reached , but there is a `` delay '' in appreciating this fact . * replacing with a stochastic de of ito type : @xmath58 .",
    "again we note that there is zero probability of landing exactly on the discontinuity surface(s ) .",
    "the interesting feature of this approach is that it is bound to sample different vector fields around @xmath0 .",
    "the disadvantage is that it makes quantitative predictions possible only in a statistical sense .    with the exception of ( c )",
    ", the other choices above effectively replace the original pws with another deterministic dynamical system , possibly discrete ( as in the case of euler method ) .",
    "but , unfortunately , these new systems have their own dynamics , and it is unclear whether or not these are consistent with that of .",
    "see section [ numerics_section ] for ample illustration of this fact . at the same time , each of the cases above has some distinguished features , that we will attempt to retain .",
    "our proposal to evaluate the dynamics of in a neighborhood of @xmath0 is to :    _ `` consider the euler iterates with random steps , '' _    with steps uniformly distributed about a reference stepsize . in other words ,",
    "we want to retain the simplicity of looking at euler iterates , but aim at retaining a certain amount of randomness in the process to avoid getting trapped by the purely euler dynamics .",
    "furthermore , in this work we will restrict to well - scaled vector fields @xmath10 , @xmath59 , with none of the @xmath60 s in exceeding @xmath40 in absolute value .",
    "the reason for this is to avoid the numerical trajectory going too far away from @xmath0 , and at the same time to attempt retaining the flavor of a hysteretical trajectory .",
    "we will complement our experiments made with the above strategy , by also using other approaches .",
    "for example , euler method with constant stepsizes , singular perturbation regularizations , and also numerical integration of performed with variable stepsize integrators .",
    "we emphasize that our goal is to reach some conclusions insofar as what should happen to a solution trajectory of in a ( small ) neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "we are not comparing methods , or different recipes of ideal sliding motion , but simply trying to evaluate the dynamics of in the most plausible and honest way we can think of , without superimposing on any extra modeling assumption .    finally , one more caveat .",
    "our examples are all of systems in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the discontinuity surfaces @xmath61 and @xmath25 are planes ; this makes it easier to visualize and understand things .",
    "higher dimensional state space , and non - planar discontinuity surfaces , can surely bring new phenomena into play , but we have no reason to suspect that the basic picture that emerges in our study , with the dichotomy between attractivity and lack of attractivity of @xmath0 , will be modified substantially .    the remainder of this work is structured as follows . in section [ br_section ] , we consider a prototypical regularization of the bilinear vector field , and give sufficient ( and sharp ) conditions guaranteeing that the regularized solution converges to a sliding solution on @xmath0 according to . in section [ euler_section ] , we give some details of how we implemented the above mentioned proposal , particularly of what practical criteria we adopted to detect `` exiting '' from a neighborhood of @xmath0 . in section [ numerics_section ] ,",
    "we illustrate through several examples the different things that can happen , and their dependence on the adopted simulation choice .",
    "space regularizations are often employed in literature as an analytical mean to model the switching mechanism of a discontinuous system , see @xcite . typically , these regularizations are one parameter families of vector fields with different time scales in a neighborhood of the sliding surface @xmath0 , namely a slow dynamics tangent to @xmath0 and a fast one normal to @xmath0 . in",
    "what follows , we consider regularizations for filippov discontinuous systems as in , but other approaches are available in the literature for non - smooth systems that are not of filippov s type , for example control systems with nonlinear control , as in @xcite .",
    "when the regularization parameter goes to zero , the regularized solution converges to a solution of filippov s differential inclusion ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 , ",
    "it follows that , if @xmath0 is a codimension @xmath40 discontinuity surface , for any regularization that satisfies the assumptions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem @xmath40 , @xmath62 ) , the corresponding solution will converge to the unique sliding filippov solution on @xmath0 as the regularization parameter goes to zero .",
    "but if @xmath0 has codimension @xmath63 , then the ambiguity of filippov s selection will reflect also in the amibiguity of the limit of regularized solutions ( in other words , the limit will depend on the chosen regularization ) .",
    "our goal in this section is to study the limiting behavior of the solutions of a certain regularization , namely the bilinear interpolant , or simply bilinear , regularization below .",
    "this regularization ( or a close relative ) has often been employed and studied in the literature ; see @xcite . more specifically",
    ", we will study when the solution of the bilinear regularization converges to the solution of a particular selection of the filippov s vector field : the sliding bilinear vector field .",
    "when @xmath0 is nodally attractive , this convergence has been shown in ( * ? ? ?",

    "this can be achieved either upon sliding along @xmath61 and/or @xmath25 ( @xmath0 is attractive upon sliding ) , or spiralling around @xmath0 ( @xmath0 is spirally attractive ) ; see definition [ attrsigma ] . for later reference , and under the stated attractivity assumptions of @xmath0",
