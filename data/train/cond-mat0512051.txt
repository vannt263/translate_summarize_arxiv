    "understanding the behavior of linear polymers in random media has been an important problem in statistical physics , both for reasons of theoretical interest , and applications . calculation of quenched averages over the disorder is a very hard problem both analytically and computationally @xcite .",
    "there have been many speculations and controversies regarding critical behavior of self - avoiding walks ( saws ) in random media ( especially at the percolation threshold ) .",
    "exact calculation of quenched averages has not been possible so far for any nontrivial case , and simulations are not easy and often give contradicting results for this problem . in this context",
    ", it seems useful to construct a toy model , where one can explicitly calculate the quenched and annealed averages , and see their difference .",
    "this is what we shall do in this paper , for the problem of linear polymers on a deterministic fractal .",
    "it is straight forward to calculate annealed averages of self - avoiding walks on deterministic fractals using real - space renormalization techniques @xcite .",
    "one can explicitly write down a closed set of exact renormalization equations in a finite number of variables , so long as the fractal has a finite ramification index . then",
    ", the eigenvalues of the linearized recursion equations near the fixed point of the renormalization transformation determine the critical exponents of the problem .",
    "in fact , a good deal of understanding of the complex behavior of polymers with additional interactions , e.g. self - interaction , or with a wall , or with other polymers , has been obtained by studying the corresponding analytically tractable problem on fractals @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable that the study of effect of inhomogeneities of the substrate would also be more tractable on fractal lattices .",
    "this is specially promising , as one does not need to introduce disorder in the problem from outside .",
    "the fractal lattices do not have translational symmetry , and hence a polymer living on a fractal lattice necessarily sees an inhomogeneous environment .",
    "some regions of the lattice are better connected than others , and the local free density of the polymer per monomer in these regions would be lower than other parts .",
    "we want to understand the effect of presence of such regions on the large - scale structure and properties of the polymer .",
    "the main difference from the usual polymer in disordered medium problem to the case we study here is that the favorable and unfavorable regions are not randomly distributed over the lattice , but have a predetermined regular structure in the case of deterministic fractals . in this context , the annealed averages , which means averaging the partition function of the polymer over different positions , are appropriate in cases where the polymer can move freely over different parts of the lattice .",
    "the quenched average is averaging _ the logarithm _ of the partition function of the polymer over different positions , and would be appropriate where this freedom is not present .",
    "the annealed average for linear and branched polymers have been calculated exactly for many different fractal lattices @xcite .",
    "but to our knowledge the quenched averages have not been calculated so far on any fractal lattice . in this paper",
    ", we use the recursive structure of fractals to calculate quenched averages for linear polymers on deterministic fractals .",
    "we find that the connectivity constant @xmath6 , and the radius of gyration exponent @xmath7 are the same for the annealed and quenched averages .",
    "the critical exponents for the quenched case can be expressed as the lyapunov exponents for random product of finite - dimensional matrices .",
    "these can be estimated numerically efficiently by monte carlo methods , which we do for the illustrative case of @xmath12-simplex fractal .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we define the @xmath12-simplex lattice and specify the scheme we use to label the sites of the lattice .",
    "we also define the annealed and quenched averages precisely , and the generating functions for different quantities of interest . in section 3",
    "we work out the recursion equations for generating functions of self - avoiding polygons(saps ) and saws on @xmath12-simplex . in section 4",
    "we derive rigorous bounds on the number of rooted saps and saws , and prove that the connectivity constant @xmath6 , and the size exponent @xmath7 are the same for the quenched and annealed averages . in section 5 ,",
    "we study the variation of the number of saps and saws with the position of the root on the @xmath12-simplex lattice numerically . in section 6 ,",
    "we determine numerical values of the critical exponents in the quenched case by monte carlo determination of lyapunov exponents for random products of matrices .",
    "we will illustrate the general technique by working out explicitly the simple case of saws and saps on the @xmath12-simplex fractal . the treatment is easily generalized to other recursively defined fractals of finite ramification index .",
    "the @xmath12-simplex graph is defined recursively as follows [ fig.[simplex1 ] ] : the graph of the first order triangle is a single vertex with @xmath12 bonds .",
    "the @xmath17th order triangle is formed by joining graphs of three @xmath18-th order triangle by connecting a dangling bond of each to a dangling bond of the other @xmath18th order subgraphs .",
    "there is one dangling bond left in each graph and @xmath12 bonds altogether . in general",
    ", the @xmath18th order graph will have @xmath19 vertices and @xmath20 internal bonds , and @xmath12 boundary bonds .",
    "clearly , the fractal dimension of this lattice is @xmath21 .",
    "we use a ternary base single integer to label different sites of an @xmath18-th order triangle .",
    "the labeling is explained in fig .",
    "[ simplex1 ] . a point on the @xmath18-th order triangle",
    "is labelled by a string of @xmath22 characters , e.g. @xmath23 .",
    "each character takes one of three values @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the leftmost character specifies in which of the three sub - triangles the point lies ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 for the top , left and right sub - triangle respectively ) .",
    "the next character specifies placement in the @xmath22-th order sub - triangle , and so on . on an infinite lattice , specification of @xmath3 requires an infinitely long string . in discussing the local neighborhood of a site",
    ", we only need to know the last few digits of @xmath3 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath28_r$ ] the substring consisting of the last @xmath18 characters of the integer label of @xmath3 , and by @xmath29 the rth digit in the string @xmath3 counted from the right .",
    "as an example , for the string @xmath30 , @xmath28_2 =   11 $ ] , and @xmath31 . also , in an obvious notation , @xmath28_r = s_r [ s]_{r-1}$ ] .",
    "= .7    the rooted polygons are polygons that pass through a given site ( see fig .",
    "[ simplex1 ] ) called the root .",
    "let @xmath1 be the number of rooted polygons of perimeter @xmath2 corresponding to root @xmath3 . the generating function for rooted polygons for root @xmath3 is defined as    @xmath32    similarly , we define @xmath0 as the number of open walks of length @xmath2 whose one end - point is @xmath3 , and the corresponding generating function @xmath33 by    @xmath34    for a given value of @xmath2 , the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 depend only on the last few digits in the ternary integer labeling @xmath3 .",

    "one assumes that @xmath3 is equally likely to be any one of the @xmath40 sites in the @xmath17-th order triangle .",

    "one can then define the mean diameter of all polygons of perimeter @xmath2 rooted at a given site @xmath3 , as the average diameter , with all such polygons given equal weight .",

    "we also show the maximum and minimum values of @xmath244 attained , as a function of @xmath2 , as @xmath3 takes all possible values .",
    "note that though we could study sizes upto @xmath169 exactly , it is difficult to estimate @xmath58 and @xmath10 even to two digit precision from the data using standard series extrapolation techniques because of log - periodic oscillations .",
    "the log - periodic variation of @xmath245 is easy to understand qualitatively @xcite .",
    "all sap s of order @xmath18 in a given @xmath17th order triangle have to pass through the three constriction points where the constituting @xmath18-th order triangles are joined .",
    "there is a natural length @xmath246 , where @xmath124 is some constant , for a polymer that does this .",
    "if the length is somewhat smaller than this value , the polymer is a bit stretched , and has a lower entropy .",
    "if it is a higher by a factor @xmath247 or so , it loses entropy as many monomers have to squeeze in the same space .",
    "if the value of @xmath2 increases by a factor @xmath248 , then same thing happens at a higher order triangle .",
    "the sites which maximize @xmath1 for a given @xmath2 are the at the constriction points of the the corresponding @xmath18-th order triangles . as @xmath249 changes",
    ", these points also change .",
    "the fractional number of points @xmath3 for which @xmath1 attains its maximum value clearly varies as @xmath250 , where @xmath18 is the order of a typical loop of perimeter @xmath2 . using @xmath251",
    ", we see that the density of points varies as @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is the fractal dimension of the lattice .",
    "the log - periodic oscillations for open walks are much smaller in magnitude than in case of polygons . here also , the number of open walks or order @xmath18 is greater if the root is near the corner point of an @xmath254 order triangle , as then it gets more space to explore and hence more entropy .",
    "we find the amplitude of oscillations in @xmath255 is approximately @xmath256 times smaller than for the corresponding quantity for closed polygons shown in fig .",

    "[ d400 ] and [ d600 ] we have shown the density plots for saps on fractal lattices for @xmath257 and @xmath258 , the different sites are shown by different colours depending on the value of @xmath259 at that site .",
    "the blue regions represent sites with largest values of @xmath1 .",
    "we clearly see that depending on value of @xmath2 some sites are more favoured than others .",
    "we note that the difference between maximum and minimum values of @xmath78 is more than 10 for @xmath257 , but only about half of this value for @xmath260 .",
    "= 1.0    = 1.0",
    "we note that to a very good approximation , all loops of a given perimeter @xmath2 have the same order , say @xmath180 , where @xmath180 is an integer approximately equal to @xmath261 .",
    "the contribution of these loops to @xmath262 then comes mostly from the single term @xmath263_{r_0 - 1 } )   { b^{(r_0)}}^2    $ ] corresponding to @xmath264 in the equation ( [ eq17 ] ) . also , if @xmath265 , then the contribution is @xmath241 , which is a slowly varying function of @xmath2 .",
    "the contribution of nearby values of @xmath2 to the @xmath180-th term will be comparable .",
    "the number of such terms that contribute to the @xmath180-th term is of order @xmath2 .",
    "thus we have ,        here @xmath271 and @xmath272 are specific @xmath12-dimensional bra- and ket vectors .",
    "then from the general theory of random product of matrices @xcite , it follows that the probability distribution of @xmath269 tends to a log - normal distribution for large @xmath180 , and @xmath273 where @xmath274 is the largest lyapunov exponent for the random product of matrices .",
    "this also implies that the variance of @xmath78 will be proportional to @xmath249 .",
    "this is much less than some positive power of @xmath2 , which is the expected behaviour for the usual polymer in the random medium problem .",
    "for example , for the directed polymer in a random medium , the variance of free energy of an @xmath2 monomer chain varies as @xmath275 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the deterministic fractal case studied here , the favourable and unfavourable regions are very evenly distributed .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate @xmath280 numerically .",
    "we start with an arbitrary initial 3-dimensional vector @xmath281 of positive elements with sum @xmath27 , and evolve it randomly by the rule @xmath282 where @xmath283 is randomly chosen to be one of three matrices @xmath284 and @xmath285 is a multiplying factor chosen so that the sum of elements of new vector is again @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath283 are            we iterate eq.[ita ] many times , and estimate @xmath274 by @xmath290 .",
    "the error in @xmath291 decreases as @xmath292 , where @xmath293 is the rms fluctuation of @xmath294 .",
    "values of @xmath295 require less than a minute of cpu . for @xmath296 , we find @xmath297 and @xmath298      a similar calculation for the exponent @xmath11 can also be done . to calculate the exponent @xmath11 , we note that again the most contribution to @xmath33 will come from terms with @xmath301 . at @xmath302 , @xmath303,@xmath304 and @xmath305 become independent of @xmath18 .",
    "if          hence , @xmath311 and @xmath312 will increase as @xmath313 , for almost all @xmath3 , for @xmath314 . for @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "therefore it follows that the leading order contribution to equation ( 29 ) will come from @xmath318 term .",
    "hence @xmath319 tends to @xmath320 and we get                        for a mathematical derivation of the log - periodic oscillations in of the taylor coefficients of functions satisfying functional equations similar to eq.(28 ) , see a. m. odlyzko , adv .",
