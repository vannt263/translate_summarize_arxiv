    "beam splitters are the elementary optical devices frequently used in classical and quantum optics @xcite , which can even work well in the level of single photon quanta @xcite and are applied to generate quantum entanglement @xcite . for matter waves",
    ", an early beam splitter can be referred to the experiments of neutron interference based on a perfect crystal interferometer with wavefront and amplitude division n - interfer ; and now an atomic beam splitter has been experimentally implemented on the atom chip @xcite .",
    "the theoretical protocols have been suggested to realize the beam splitter for the bose - einstein condensate @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose and study the implementation of beam splitter for the spin wave propagations in the star - shaped spin networks ( sssns ) with @xmath1 weighted legs ( see the fig .",
    "1a ) , where each leg is a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) spin chain with @xmath2 couplings .",
    "this investigation is mostly motivated by our recent researches on the perfect transfer of quantum states along a single quantum spin chain @xcite and for a 1-d bloch electron system @xcite .",
    "the similar quantum networks have been considered for a coupled many harmonic oscillator system @xcite and for quantum cloning via spin networks @xcite .",
    "a basic sssn is a @xmath0-shaped network or called @xmath0-beam @xcite for @xmath3 , which can be regarded as an elementary block , in principle , to the architecture of complicated networks ( such as a solid state interferometer ) for quantum information processing .",
    "it can function to transfer quantum state coherently in multi - channel and to generate entanglement between two spins which are a long distance apart .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the quantum coherence of spin waves propagating in two legs can be well controlled by adjusting the coupling strengths only at the node ; and then a controllable solid state interferometer is built based on this crucial function .     and @xmath4 output spin chain .",

    "( b ) @xmath0-shaped network or called @xmath0-beam , a special star - shaped spin network , serves as the fundamental block for the architecture of complicated quantum spin networks _ , title=\"fig:\",width=4 ]",
    "the basic element of an arbitrary spin network is the coupling between spins , which is usually described by the @xmath2 hamiltonianin@xmath5where @xmath6 are the pauli spin operators acting on the internal space of electron on the @xmath7th site",
    ". one can apply magnetic field @xmath8 beforehand and then switch off it , to prepare a polarized initial states with all spins down for the quantum network .",
    "the dynamics of the lower excitations ( magnons ) from this polarized state is attractive because of their relevance to quantum information applications . in the low - temperature and low magnon density limit",
    ", the magnon can be regarded as boson by the holstein - primakoff transformation @xmath9 .",
    "then one can translates a @xmath2 spin network into the bosonic system with the hamiltonian @xmath10 , approximately .",
    "note that such map is exact for the case of single magnon .",
    "we consider a spin network of a star shape ( we call the sssn ) as shown in fig . 1a . under the holstein - primakoff transformation",
    "the hamiltonian of leg @xmath11 consisting of @xmath12 spins with @xmath2 interactions can be written as@xmath13where @xmath14 are the boson operators on the @xmath15th site of the @xmath16th leg .",
    "here we have assumed that the couplings @xmath17 are the same for a given bosonic chain @xmath16 .",
    "we uniquely denote the hamiltonian by @xmath18 for the bosonic chain hereafter .",
    "the sssn is constructed by linking the @xmath4 output bosonic chains to the one end ( or the node ) @xmath19 of the input leg @xmath20 by the couplings @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian of an sssn is of the form as the same as eq .",
    "( 2 ) except for the part around the node @xmath19 .",
    "we will show that , due to the quantum interference mechanism , by some constrain for the coupling constants @xmath17  and @xmath21 , an sssn can be reduced into an imaginary linear bosonic chain with homogeneous coupling plus a smaller complicated network if only the single - magnon case is concerned .",
    "the fact that the input chain @xmath20 is a part of this virtual linear chain implies that the bosonic wave packet can perfectly propagate in this virtual linear chain without the reflection by the node .",
    "this indicates that there is a coherent split of the input bosonic wave packet because the magnon excitation in this virtual chain actually is just a superposition of magnon excitations in the @xmath4 bosonic chains .    to sketch the central idea ,",
    "we first consider a special sssn , which consists of @xmath4 identical output  chains @xmath22 @xmath23 with homogeneous coupling @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the same length @xmath26 , while the length of chain @xmath20 is @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath51where @xmath52the first hamiltonian @xmath53 describes @xmath39 independent virtual bosonic chains without input from @xmath54 while the second one describes a linear bosonic chain with an impurity at the @xmath27th site . in usual",
    "it can reflect the bosonic wave packet from the input leg .    only when the coupling matching conation @xmath55 is satisfied , the virtual bosonic chain described by @xmath56 is just a standard bosonic chain since @xmath57 . in this case",
    "no reflection occurs at the node . with this matched node coupling , an ideal beam splitter can be realized with @xmath4 coherent outputs since each operator @xmath49 is a linear combination of @xmath58 .",
    "then it can create a superposition from the vacuum state with bosons excitation .",
    "each component of this superposition represents a magnon or boson excitation in a leg .",
    "the detailed analysis will be done with the special sssn of @xmath59 in the next section .",
    "actually , we need not require the two output legs to be identical . to be convenient , we consider the asymmetric @xmath0-beam consisting of three legs @xmath20 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 with three hopping integrals @xmath62 for @xmath63 and the node interactions @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",

    "thus when we set @xmath101 , the coupling matching  condition @xmath102holds . especially , the virtual bosonic chain @xmath32 becomes homogenous when condition ( [ matching ] )  is satisfied .",
    "then it can be employed to transfer the quantum state without reflection on the node in the transformed picture . by transforming back to the original picture ,",
    "the quantum state transfer is shown to be a perfect beam splitting .",
    "similar to the point of view of linear optics , such beam splitting process can generate entanglement .",
    "we will show that the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 can determine the amplitudes of the bosonic wave packet on legs @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "it shows that around the coupling matching condition ( [ matching ] ) , the reflection factor vanishes , which is just in agreement with our analytical result .     and @xmath123 @xmath124 for the same setup as that in fig .",

    "the spin wave can be regarded as being transferred along the virtual legs @xmath32 and @xmath89 .",
    "once we manipulate the coupling constants to satisfy the coupling matching condition , the spin wave can only enter the leg @xmath32 rather than @xmath89 without any reflection .",
