    "recall that a normal projective variety @xmath1 with log terminal singularities such that the anticanonical divisor @xmath2 is an ample @xmath3-cartier divisor is said to be _ fano_. a nonsingular fano surface",
    "is usually called a _ del pezzo surface_. their classification is well known : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 blown up in at most eight points ( in general position ) . of these ,",
    "the first five are toric .",
    "nonsingular fano threefolds have also been classified .",
    "there are seventeen families with picard number one , and eighty - nine other families  ( @xcite ) .",
    "a great deal more can be said concerning nonsingular toric fano varieties ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are eighteen smooth toric fano threefolds ( @xcite ) , and @xmath6 smooth toric fano fourfolds ( @xcite ) . an inductive algorithm for classifying the smooth toric fano @xmath7-folds",
    "was recently described in  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm requires knowledge of the gorenstein toric fano @xmath8-folds and , using the data from  @xcite , allowed the classification of the five - folds .",
    "bro has presented a different algorithm based on the ingenious notion of _ special facets _ ; using this method dimensions six , seven , and eight have now been classified ( see  @xcite ) .    in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the degree @xmath9 of any smooth fano variety @xmath1 of dimension @xmath7 is bounded , as is the number of deformation types .",
    "similar results are not known for fano varieties in general ; but the number of isomorphism classes of toric fano varieties of fixed dimension and bounded discrepancy is known to be finite ( see  @xcite )",
    ". it thus makes sense to look for complete classifications in the toric setting beyond the smooth cases .",
    "gorenstein toric fano varieties have been classified up to dimension four .",
    "there are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 isomorphism classes in , respectively , dimension two , three , and four ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "these classifications are of particular interest : gorenstein toric fano varieties are used to construct mirror pairs of calabi - yau varieties ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "one can also attempt to classify those toric fano varieties with at worst terminal singularities .",
    "every surface of this form is nonsingular , and so the classification reduces to the smooth case above . in three dimensions , the author showed in  @xcite that there are ( up to isomorphism ) @xmath13 varieties , of which @xmath14 are @xmath3-factorial and @xmath15 are gorenstein",
    ".    all the above classifications are subsets of a more general case : toric fano varieties with at worst canonical singularities . here",
    "the surface case reduces to the gorenstein case .",
    "this paper describes an inductive approach to achieving a classification in higher dimensions . as an application",
    ", the classification for threefolds is calculated .",
    "there are @xmath0 isomorphism classes .",
    "as well as encapsulating the three ",
    "dimensional classifications mentioned above , it is worth observing that @xmath16 of the resulting varieties are @xmath3-factorial ( of which the picard number is bounded by @xmath17 ) .",
    "the classification is available online via the graded rings database ( @xcite ) at http://malham.kent.ac.uk[`http://malham.kent.ac.uk/ ` ] .",

    "this is a significant undertaking ; a month of computation on a parallel computing system was required .",
