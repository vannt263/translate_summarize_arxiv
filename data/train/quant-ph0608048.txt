    "from the matrix element of electromagnetic interaction hamiltonian we see that the strength of this interaction is characterized by @xmath2 , in which @xmath3 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath4 is the number of photons in the electromagnetic wave mode participating the interaction . in the processes with usual light , @xmath5 ,",
    "the strength of the electromagnetic interaction is of the order of @xmath6 , it is weak , and therefore may be handled by lowest order perturbation .",
    "however , in the processes with lasers , @xmath4 becomes large , the electromagnetic interaction is no longer weak . in this case , either a high order perturbation has to be used , or perturbation becomes totally unapplicable .",
    "anyway , the process induced by intense laser with huge number @xmath4 can only be handled by non - perturbation method . to explore the non - perturbative effects in electromagnetic processes",
    "is interesting .",
    "soon after the discovery of laser , voronov and delone@xcite observed the multi - photon ionization ( mpi ) , in which an atom absorbs more than one photons from the laser and is ionized .",
    "several years later , agostini _",
    "et al_@xcite observed the above threshold ionization ( ati ) .",
    "it is the photo - ionization with the photoelectron energy being larger than the photon energy .",
    "when the laser intensity is not too high , they may still be understood by perturbation@xcite , though the perturbation order has to be high . in 1988 , bucksbaum _",
    "et al_@xcite observed electrons ejected from atoms and scattered to large angles by an intense standing electromagnetic wave , which is something like the kapitza - dirac effect@xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of electron in this experiment is very characteristic .",

    "batelaan@xcite observed the kapitza - dirac effect in 2000 .",
    "it is of course a non - perturbative effect in electron - laser interaction .",
    "the position of peaks in electron diffraction may be well understood by wave property of electrons and geometrical consideration . to understand the height of these diffraction peaks one needs the quantum dynamics for electron - laser system .",
    "we showed@xcite the excellent agreement between the quantum dynamical calculation and the experiment in this respect .",
    "the main problem in theoretical consideration of the laser - atom interaction is to solve the electron motion under the combined interaction of the coulomb field and the laser field . to find an analytical solution , even though approximate , seems hopeless .",

    "it is to find a balance between the analytical derivation and the numerical computation .",
    "there is a way to solve the time dependence of the schrdinger equation analytically for the atom in a circularly polarized laser@xcite . in this way",
    "the problem of the atom - laser interaction reduces to an eigenvalue problem of a time independent effective hamiltonian for the atom .",
    "the energy representation of the effective hamiltonian is a matrix of order infinite . in numerical solution",

    "we found the rapid convergence of the solution when the order of matrix increases@xcite .",
    "the problem of hydrogen in a circularly polarized laser may therefore be solved by a reasonable amount of numerical computation .",
    "we quantize the electromagnetic field around a classical field representing the laser in section [ s2 ] , to separate the perturbation and non - perturbation parts of the problem . in section [ s3 ] , we solve the time dependence of the schrdinger equation analytically and separate the relative motion between the electron and proton from the motion of center of mass for a non - relativistic hydrogen atom interacting with a circularly polarized laser . in the dipole limit , the modification of the nucleus motion on the relative motion is again the substitution of reduced mass for the electron mass .",

    "this is @xmath34 showing that @xmath32 is a coherent state with non - zero amplitude(s ) @xmath23 . in the classical limit it is @xmath30 itself .    the interaction operator between the electromagnetic field and a non - relativistic spinless electron is @xmath35 in which @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are charge , mass , and momentum respectively of the electron .",

    "when one regards the generalized bohr condition @xmath123 with integer @xmath124 as an expression of energy conservation , he has omitted the interaction energy between the atom and the electromagnetic field .",

    "the non - integer transition is a typical non - perturbative effect , and the violation of bohr condition is therefore not surprising . while fig.[c2 ] shows that the transition probability is not proportional to an integer power of the intensity .",
    "it means , the interaction between the laser and the atom can not be reduced to interactions of individual photons with the atom separately .",
    "the interaction is between the atom and the laser as a whole .",

    "this scenery is quite different from the regularity one saw in the weak light ( including weak laser ) spectroscopy , therefore has to be checked by new experiments .",
    "one may observe the radiation of the atom after it has been irradiated by an intense laser . in this way , the changes of distributions of atoms among various energy levels , and therefore their transition probabilities , are measured .",
    "although there is not any separate resonance , fig.[c1 ] still shows complex structure in the spectrum .",
    "it is interesting to find out the information exposed by this kind of structure .",
    "the photo - ionization or the photoelectric effect is the transition of the electron from the ground state to the ionized state , when it is irradiated by light .",
    "the photo - ionization by an intense circularly polarized laser may be handled by the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , that the energy of the ionized electron ( photo - electron ) is @xmath125 and the transition probability per unit time is @xmath126 with @xmath127 @xmath79 in ( [ 33 ] ) is an eigenfunction of @xmath78 , satisfying ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "@xmath81 in ( [ 31 ] ) is the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "@xmath128 is the eigenfunction of @xmath117 , with eigenvalue @xmath129 , therefore is a projection of the coulomb wave function onto the subspace with definite magnetic quantum number @xmath130 , and describes the ionized electron .    in the weak light limit , @xmath115",
    ", @xmath86 approaches an eigenfunction of @xmath117 , which is also the ground state eigenfunction of @xmath131 with zero magnetic quantum number ; and @xmath81 approaches the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "they are independent of @xmath107 . for the hydrogen atom , they are @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively , @xmath134 is the binding energy of the electron in the ground state hydrogen atom . in the case of @xmath135 , we have ( [ 280 ] ) , therefore the selection rule ( [ 281 ] ) works .",
    "these limits make the energy ( [ 31 ] ) of the photoelectron be @xmath136 and the transition probability @xmath137 proportional to the light intensity .",
    "this example shows , in the weak light limit , the photo - ionization has the following distinct characters :    0.1 in c1.there is a critical frequency for a given system.the light with frequency lower than this critical value can not eject any electron from the system .    c2.the light with frequency higher than this critical value can ionize the system , the energy of the ejected electron increases linearly with the increasing of the frequency but is independent of the intensity of the light .",
    "c3.the intensity of the photo - electric current is proportional to the intensity of the light .",
    "0.1 in this is exactly the experimental knowledge on photo - ionization , people had before the discovery of the laser . based on this knowledge and guided by his idea of light quanta ,",
    "one hundred years ago , einstein @xcite found his famous formula ( [ 34 ] ) and the idea that the light - atom interaction may be reduced to the interactions between photons and atoms . in this way",
    ", he explained the above experimental characters of photo - ionization .",
    "this was a crucial step towards the discovery of quantum mechanics .",
    "now we see , all of these experimental characters , as well as the einstein formula ( [ 34 ] ) , together with his idea that photons interact with atoms independently , are the perturbation results of quantum mechanics in the weak light limit .",
    "what will be the scenery when the light becomes an intense laser ?",
    "if one puts @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , the formula ( [ 34 ] ) becomes the bohr condition @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , the einstein formula is a predecessor of the bohr condition . soon after the discovery of laser , people observed mpi@xcite and ati@xcite .",
    "einstein formula was generalized to be @xmath141 with @xmath124 being an positive integer .",
    "it is a special case of the generalized bohr condition @xmath142 and may be deduced by the higher order perturbation .",

    ". this will not necessarily be the case for a non - perturbation interaction between the atom and an intense laser .",
    "it means the photo - ionization may be a non - integer quantum transition .",
    "this is a true non - perturbation effect , which can not be handled by perturbation of any order .",
    "using the numerical solution of ( [ 21 ] ) obtained in the last section , we find the light intensity dependence of the photoelectron energy .",
    "the numerical result is shown in fig.[c3 ] .",
    "the transition probability ( [ 32 ] ) may be expressed in the form of cross section .",

    "applying it to the photo - ionization of the hydrogen atom irradiated by a circularly polarized laser , under the condition @xmath75 , we obtain the cross section @xmath147 in unit of @xmath148 . here , @xmath149 is the velocity of the photoelectron , and @xmath150 is an elementary but some what lengthy and tedious expression , containing integrals of the type @xmath151 the integral has been analytically worked out .",
    "there are two confluent hypergeometric functions f on the left .",

    ", it has to be substituted by ( [ 36 ] ) , with possibly non - integer @xmath122 .",

    "that is , the energy difference between photo - electrons with different magnetic quantum number @xmath130 is an integer multiple of the quantum energy @xmath1 , as people observed in ati . from fig.[c4 ] we see , the cross sections depend on the light intensity nonlinearly .",
    "it means that the character c3 is not true for laser photo - ionization .",
    "the interaction between light and atoms can not be reduced to the independent interactions between photons and atoms .",
