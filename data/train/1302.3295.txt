    "1998 ; hayashino et al .",
    "extremely strong lyc detected from some sample galaxies suggested that they contain a primordial stellar population like metal - free stars with mass fraction of 110% ( inoue et al .",
    ". however , vanzella et al . ( 2010b ) raised a possibility that the supposed lyc detected from the galaxies come from a foreground galaxy closely aligned along the line - of - sight toward the background @xmath13 galaxies .",
    "the lyc observers discussed this possibility in their papers and concluded that it was unlikely that all the detections were foreground contamination , while a part of them were so ( iwata et al . 2009 ; nestor et al . 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "indeed , nestor et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found an example of such a contamination : a foreground galaxy very closely ( @xmath14 ) located in the front of a ly@xmath0 emitter ( lae ) with the possible lyc detection reported ( iwata et al . 2009 ; inoue et al . 2011 ; nestor et al . 2011 ) .",
    "hereafter , we call this galaxy lae 221724@xmath1001716 .    because of the small angular separation between the foreground and background galaxies ,",
    "lae 221724@xmath1001716 may be a strong gravitational lensing system .",
    "the gravitational lensing is now recognized as a powerful tool for observational cosmology and galaxy formation and evolution studies ( e.g. , kneib & natarajan 2011 ; see also coe et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .",
    "the strong lensing enables us to search faint high - redshift galaxies behind galaxy clusters and investigate physical properties of galaxies with higher signal - to - noise ratio by brightening and magnifying effect .",
    "if lae 221724@xmath1001716 is a strongly magnified @xmath15 lae , the intrinsic luminosity should be very faint , whereas its apparent luminosity is brightest among general laes . in this case",
    ", this object provides us with a chance to investigate the nature of a faint lae in detail .",

    "35 ) in matsuda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) because of its spatially extended ly@xmath0 emission , but this spatial extent is caused by the connection of the emission line from an eastern close companion object ( the separation between them is @xmath24 ) .",

    "( 2011 ) suggested a very low possibility that @xmath32 flux comes from a foreground object .",
    "however , nestor et al . ( 2012 ) found an emission line around 3360   in the new deep spectrum of this object , strongly suggesting the presence of a foreground galaxy very closely aligned toward the @xmath12 lae .",
    "if this emission line is ly@xmath0 , the foreground galaxy lies at @xmath36 .",
    "nestor et al . ( 2012 ) also noted that the southern tail is the foreground galaxy because of a small spatial offset of the 3360   line and 4980   line ( ly@xmath0 at @xmath12 ) .",

    "the angular separation between lae 221724@xmath1001716 detected in @xmath33 bands and the foreground galaxy detected in the @xmath32 bands is estimated as @xmath37 ( inoue et al .",

    "table  1 is the result . as an estimate of the total flux density , we adopt mag_auto by sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . then , we find the aperture correction factor of 2.43 ( i.e. , @xmath53  mag ) in @xmath44 . we apply it even for other bands when estimating the total flux densities in the following .",
    "we construct a gravitational lens model for lae 221724@xmath1001716 .",
    "we use the so - called singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) lens model ( e.g. , binney & merrified 1998 ) for lae 221724@xmath1001716 .",
    "this lens model is appropriate for describing the actual density distribution of the dark matter halo of a galaxy .",
    "moreover , this sis lens model has only one parameter , that is , the velocity dispersion for the foreground galaxy , @xmath54 .",

    "2012 in detail ) .",
    "we also note that this relation is valid for the chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) with 0.1100  @xmath68 .",
    "now we estimate the stellar mass of the lensing galaxy ( @xmath69 ) , which is used as an input to eq .",
    "( [ eq - sigma+mstar ] ) , using the following two independent methods : ( a ) the uv luminosity - stellar mass relation ( sawicki 2012 ) , and ( b ) the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting method .",
    "first , we use the sawicki relation , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the absolute uv magnitude at the rest - frame wavelength of 1700   .",
    "this relation is empirically obtained from the uv - selected galaxies adopting the salpeter imf with 0.1100  @xmath68 .",
    "the stellar mass obtained with the salpeter imf is larger than that with the chabrier imf by a factor of 1.8",
    ". the observed total ab magnitude of @xmath72 by nestor et al .",
    "( 2011 ) gives @xmath73 .",
    "while this corresponds to the magnitude at @xmath74   , it can be regarded as the magnitude at @xmath75   under the assumption that the lensing galaxy has a flat continuum .",
    "this assumption is reasonable since the lensing galaxy is an lae and such a flat continuum is expected for the galaxies with young age and a small amount of dust like lae . from the sawicki relation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath76 for the chabrier imf .",
    "we adopt this value in later discussion .",
    "next , we use the sed fitting method . here",
    "we use bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model together with the following parameters : ( 1 ) chabrier imf with @xmath77100  @xmath68 , ( 2 ) the metallicity @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , ( 3 ) constant star formation history and ( 4 ) the extinction curve by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with @xmath800.2 with an interval of 0.05 . in our analysis",
    ", we use the total flux densities in optical and near infrared wavelengths described in section 2 .",
    "the total flux densities are a combination of those from lae 221724@xmath1001716 at @xmath12 and the foreground galaxy at @xmath36 .",
    "however , the total flux density of @xmath26 is considered to be dominated by the flux from the foreground galaxy if the escape fraction of the lyc photons from lae 221724@xmath1001716 is not significant .",
    "hence , in the course of the sed fitting to determine a robust upper limit and possible lower limit of @xmath81 , we use the total flux density of @xmath26 with its photometric error and regard those of the other bands as upper limits because they are contaminated by the flux from lae 221724@xmath1001716 .",
    "the resultant upper and lower limits of @xmath81 are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath81 is smaller than that estimated from the sawicki relation above ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) by a factor of @xmath85 .",
    "however , this difference is not surprising because the age of the lensing galaxy is young , @xmath86  myr , and sawicki ( 2012 ) has found that the stellar mass of such young galaxies are typically much smaller than those estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq - sawicki ] ) at a fixed @xmath71 ( see fig .",
    "6 of sawicki 2012 ) .",
    "in summary , ( a ) the sawicki relation gives @xmath87 . on the other hand , ( b )",
    "the sed fitting method gives @xmath88@xmath89 for @xmath90@xmath9 .",
    "based on these results , we estimate the gravitational magnification factor , @xmath91 . in figure  3 , we show our results for the separation between the lae and the foreground galaxy , @xmath38 .",
    "we obtain @xmath92 and @xmath931.12 in the cases ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "we note that the estimated magnification factors are fairly small although the angular separation between the lensing galaxy and the source galaxy is very small ( @xmath94  arcsec ) .",
    "this is due to the low mass of the lensing galaxy at @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated possible models for gravitational lensing for lae 221724@xmath1001716 at @xmath2 .",
    "the intervening galaxy is located at @xmath4 with a very small angular separation of 0.6  arcsec from the line of sight toward lae 221724@xmath1001716 .",
    "this small separation suggest that lae 221724@xmath1001716 could be amplified by the gravitational lensing .",
    "if this is the case , lae 221724@xmath1001716 is the first system of an lae - lae lensing .",
    "however , our analysis has shown that the magnification factor is only 1.16 at most .",
    "this result does not change significantly even if we adopt the smaller angular separation reported by inoue et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , @xmath97 : in this case , @xmath98 and 1.011.20 for @xmath99 and @xmath10093  @xmath101 inferred from the sawicki relation and the sed fitting , respectively ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "this small magnification factor is due to that the lensing galaxy at @xmath102 is significantly less massive , i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "it does not change significantly even if we adopt another sed fitting method with two galaxy components ( i.e. , the foreground galaxy at @xmath36 and lae 221724@xmath1001716 at @xmath12 ) by using all of the total flux densities ; the resultant stellar masses of the foreground galaxy and lae 221724@xmath1001716 are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , in the case of their seds are identical with each other . however , this stellar mass is not unusually small among the lae at @xmath106@xmath107 . on the contrary ,",
    "it is similar to that of the laes at @xmath106 undetected in @xmath49-band ( ono et al .",
    "hence , the intervening galaxy at @xmath108 ( and perhaps , the source galaxy at @xmath109 ) is considered to be a typical lae .    regarding the dark halo mass of laes , ouchi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that its average inferred from a clustering analysis is roughly @xmath110 at @xmath1116.6 .",
    "they also reported that the dark halo masses of laes show no significant redshift evolution in this redshift range beyond the mass - estimate scattering .",
    "it is possible that the intervening galaxy at @xmath102 with @xmath112 is embedded in such a small mass halo .",
    "this may imply that the no evolution of halo mass of laes reported by ouchi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) extends to even lower redshift , @xmath108 .",
    "the narrow - band magnitude of lae 221724@xmath1001716 is bright among the sample of the laes at @xmath113 in the ssa22 field given in yamada et al .",
    "although such property could be attributed to the gravitational magnification , the small magnification factor obtained here implies that this lae is indeed bright .",
    "however , a number of high - redshift galaxies and quasars could be gravitationally magnified by the strong lensing either by a foreground galaxy ( e.g. , faure et al .",
    "2008 ; muzzin et al .",
    "2012 ; inada et al .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile estimating how often such a lensing event occurs for laes at @xmath15 . here",
    ", we estimate the possibility of an lae at @xmath114 is gravitationally magnified by a foreground galaxy with @xmath115-band magnitude of @xmath116 .",
    "this is actually the case for lae 221724@xmath1001716 studied in this paper since @xmath72 and @xmath117 approximately correspond to @xmath118 .",
    "we evaluate the possibility to find more than one foreground galaxy within 0.6  arcsec using the @xmath115-band number count data obtained by vlt / vimos ( vanzella et al .",
    "2010b ) ; note that the central wavelengths of both @xmath26 and @xmath29 is similar to that of @xmath115-band on vlt / vimos .",
    "the possibility , @xmath119 , is calculated by using the following equation @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the radius from the background galaxy and @xmath122 is the @xmath115-band galaxy number count . adopting @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( galaxies with @xmath12525.5 ) , we obtain @xmath126 .",
    "we conclude that the possibility to find a foreground galaxy around an lae at @xmath15 within a radius of 0.6  arcsec is very small ; the probability of lae - lae lensing is even smaller if lae fraction at @xmath102 among the entire galaxy population is small .",
    "nevertheless , we have found such a case .",
    "a possible reason is that the @xmath26 detection more preferentially selects foreground galaxies than blind survey .",
    "if most of @xmath113 galaxies do not emit lyc at all , they do not detect in @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the @xmath26 detection is biased toward close - foreground systems ( vanzella et al .",
    "however , the number of the @xmath26 detections is significantly larger than that of the foreground galaxies expected , and thus , some @xmath26 sources are real lyc emitters ( iwata et al . 2009 ; inoue et al . 2011 ; nestor et al . 2011 , 2012 ) . in any case",
    ", it is interesting that the lyc survey with @xmath26 imaging is also useful to find close - foreground systems discussed in this paper .",
    "one interesting property of the gravitational lensing in lae 221724@xmath1001716 is that the lensing galaxy is located at @xmath95 .",
    "although a number of the gravitational lensing events by a galaxy have been found to date ( e.g. , faure et al . 2008 ;",
    "muzzin et al .",
    "2012 ) , the redshifts of the lensing galaxies are preferentially @xmath127 .",
    "one high - redshift lensing galaxy at @xmath128 1.5  2.5 has been found for one of sdss quasars , sdssp j104433.04@xmath129012502.2 at @xmath130 ( shioya et al .",
    "the detection of such gravitational lensing by a high - redshift galaxy ( @xmath131 ) is rare currently .",
