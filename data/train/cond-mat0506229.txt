    "we have concentrated on the analytical derivation of the drag effect in the uniform bose gases .",
    "the consideration of the non - uniform case requires the solution of the eigenvalue problem for the elementary excitations in the two - component bose gas in the external potential .",
    "but even for the simplest case of a spherically symmetric trap this problem can be solved analytically only in the long - wavelength limit and the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite ( the spectrum of elementary excitations in one - component bose gases was obtained analytically for a number of potentials but also in the same limit @xcite ) . since the main contribution to the drag density comes from the excitations with the wave vectors of order of the healing length ( see ( [ n7 ] ) ) , the rigorous analysis of the drag effect can be done only numerically .",
    "nevertheless , in the tomas - fermi situation the drag effect can be evaluated basing on the following arguments .",
    "when the linear size of the bose cloud is much larger than the healing length , the spectrum of the excitations at the wave vectors of order or higher than the inverse healing length is well described by the quasi uniform approximation .",

    "the parameters of the qubit ( [ 1019 ] ) depend on the `` drag flux '' @xmath215 .",
    "therefore , one can determine its value from the measurement of the state of the system after a controlled evolution of a certain reproducible initial state .",
    "let us consider two possibilities . for definiteness , we specify the case of odd @xmath216 and the degeneracy point @xmath217",
    "if the josephson coupling are switched off and @xmath203 is switched on to some positive value ( much less than unity ) the system is relaxed to the state @xmath218 .",
    "this state can be used as the reproducible initial state .",
    "the quantity should be measured is the expectation value of the number difference operator .",
    "in the initial state the expectation value of this operator is @xmath219    when the system is switched suddenly to the degeneracy point @xmath220 and the josephson couplings are switched on for some time @xmath221 the initial state evolves to another state with another @xmath222 .",
    "if one sets @xmath223 the result of evolution ( @xmath224 ) is described by the unitary operator @xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
    "one can see that at time of evolition @xmath227 the expectation value of the number difference operation will be equal to zero .    for the case @xmath228 and @xmath229 the operator of evolution reads as @xmath230 with @xmath231 . respectively",
    ", the expectation value @xmath232 will be equal to zero at @xmath233    the ratio @xmath234 depends only on @xmath215 and the quantity @xmath215 can be extracted from the measurements of @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "it is important to note that to provide this scheme one should control only the ratio of @xmath212 and @xmath213 , but not their absolute values .",
    "another possibility can be based on detection of the berry phase @xcite .",
    "( [ 1019 ] ) contains all three components of the field @xmath237 and they can be controlled independently .",
    "the general scheme of detection of the berry phase in such a situation was proposed @xcite .",
    "a concrete realization of this scheme in the josephson charge qubit was described in @xcite . here",
    "we extend the ideas of @xcite to the case of the `` dragged '' bose - einstein qubit .",
    "we start from the same initial state and switch to @xmath223 and @xmath220 .",
    "the initial state @xmath238 can be presented as the superposition of two instantaneous eigenstates @xmath239 and",
    "@xmath240 : @xmath241 ) results in appearance of the berry phase in the @xmath242 and @xmath243 eigenstates , if the vector @xmath244 subtends a nonzero solid angle at the origin .",
    "let us consider the following 4 stage cyclic adiabatic evolution starting from the point @xmath223 and @xmath220 : 1 - @xmath213 is switched off ; 2 - @xmath212 is switched off and simultaneously @xmath245 is switched to @xmath246 ; 3 - @xmath203 is returned to the same degeneracy point ( @xmath220 ) and @xmath213 is switched to @xmath247 ; 4 - @xmath212 is switched to @xmath228 ( all switches should be done slowly : @xmath248 ) .",
    "after such an evolution the system arrives at the state @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the berry phase ( equals to half of the solid angle subtended by @xmath237 ) and @xmath251 , @xmath252 are the dynamical phases .",
    "elimination of the dynamical phases can performed by swapping the eigenstates ( @xmath253-transformation ) and repeating the same cycle of evolution in a reverse direction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath253-transformation can be done by fast switching off the josephson coupling and switching on @xmath254 during the time interval @xmath255 .",
    "after the @xmath253-transformation the state becomes @xmath256    after the cyclic evolution in the reverse direction we arrive to the state @xmath257    one can see that the expectation value of the number difference operator in the final state ( [ 304 ] ) @xmath258 depends only on @xmath215 and the measurement of this difference allows the determine the value of the `` drag flux '' .",
    "thus , the measurements of relative number of atoms in left and right condensates under controlled evolution of the state of the system allows to observe the non - dissipative drag and determine the drag factor ( if the vorticity of the drive component is known ) .",
    "we have investigated the non - dissipative drag effect in three - dimensional weakly interacting two - component superfluid bose gases .",
    "the expression for the drag current is derived microscopically for the general case of two species of different densities , different masses and different interaction parameters .",
    "it is shown that the drag current is proportional to the square root of the gas parameter .",
    "the drag effect is maximal at zero temperatures and it decreases when the temperature increases , but at temperatures of order of the interaction energy the drag current remains of the same order as at zero temperature .    we have considered the toroidal double - well geometry , where the non - dissipative drag influences significantly on the josephson coupling between the wells . in the system considered the drag force can be interpreted as an effective vector potential applied to the drag component .",
    "the effective vector potential is equal to @xmath259 ( in units of @xmath165 ) , where @xmath260 is the phase of the drive component , and @xmath159 is the drag factor . in the toroidal geometry",
    "the effective vector potential can be associated with an effective flux of external field @xmath261 , where @xmath262 is the vorticity of the drive component . in the fock regime",
    "the system can be considered as a bose - einstein counterpart of the josephson charge qubit in an external magnetic field .",
    "the measurement of the state of such a qubit allows to observe the drag effect and determine the drag factor .",
