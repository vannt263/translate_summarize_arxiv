    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , discovered from ground - based infrared photometry in the 1970s ( rieke & low 1972 ) , are usually defined to be galaxies with bolometric luminosities from @xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath5 . over the last decade or so , we have learnt from optical and near - infrared imaging that ulirgs are mostly interacting or merging systems ( e.g. armus , heckman & miley 1987 ; melnick & mirabel 1990 ; hutchings & neff 1991 ; clements et al .",
    "1996 ; murphy et al . 1996",
    "; surace et al . 2000 ; farrah et al .",
    "2001 ; veilleux , kim & sanders 2002 ) . from spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "modelling , optical , uv and mid - infrared spectroscopic studies , x - ray and radio imaging , it seems that the power source in these galaxies is usually some combination of star formation and mass accretion onto the central black hole with the former being the dominant contributor and the latter usually increases its importance as a function of infrared luminosity ( eg rowan - robinson & crawford 1989 ; smith 1998 ; farrah et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 ; ptak et al . 2003 ; franceschini et al . 2003 ; klaas et al .",
    "2001 ; imanishi et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 ) .",
    "a basic evolutionary picture is that two or possibly more gas - rich spiral galaxies collide with each other ; the collision triggers bursts of star formation in centrally concentrated and compressed interstellar gas and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ; moorwood 1996 ; lonsdale , farrah & smith 2007 ) .",
    "the merged galaxy then turns into an elliptical and perhaps eventually an optical qso .    with the advent of infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ; kessler et al . 1996 ) and infrared spectrograph ( _ irs _ ; houck et al . 2004 ) on _ spitzer _ space telescope ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) , mid - infrared spectroscopy has become a powerful tool in studying the nature of ulirgs .",
    "broad polycyclic aromatic hydrocardons ( pahs ) features , the strongest of which are located at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 and 12.7 @xmath2 , are ubiquitous in normal galaxies and starburst systems with moderately intense uv radiation but weak or absent near an agn .",
    "it indicates that the strength of pahs is correlated with the origin of activity and thus can be used to separate a buried agn from starburst .",
    "another tool to disentangle the two energy sources is the optical depths of the silicate dust absorption features at 9.7 and 18 @xmath2 which is associated with source geometry ( imanishi et al .",
    "high ionization fine structure lines also allow us to assess the dominant ionization mechanism .",
    "for example , the presence of the [ nev ] line at 14.3 @xmath2 requires photons of energy @xmath6 ev and therefore indicates the presence of an agn .",
    "armus et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that ulirgs selected from the iras bright galaxy sample ( soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) have a large range in spectral slope , silicate optical depths and pah strengths indicative of a diverse and complex population . using diagnostics such as the ratio of high- to low - excitation mid - infrared emission lines , the 7.7 @xmath2 line - to - continuum ratio and the 6.2 @xmath2 pah emission and the 9.7 @xmath2 silicate feature , most ulirgs are found to be starburst - dominated with at least 50@xmath7 have both starburst and agn activity ( eg genzel et al . 1998 ; rigopoulou et al . 1999 ; lutz et al . 1999 ; spoon et al . 2007 ) .    however , there are some difficulties in using the aforementioned diagnostics , eg the mixing of the 7.7 @xmath2 feature with the adjacent 8.6 @xmath2 feature and the difficulty of accurately defining the underlying continuum , especially for strongly obscured sources .",
    "different groups measure pahs in different ways and sometimes their estimates can differ by a factor of two .",
    "in addition , different diagnostics often lead to different assessments of the dominant power source .",
    "principal component analysis ( pca ) has been used for spectral classification of optical galaxies with great success ( e.g. connolly et al .",
    "1995 ; bromley et al .",
    "1998 ; folkes et al . 1999 ; madgwick et al . 2002 , 2003 ; de lapparent et al . 2003 ) . in this paper , we present the first pca of mid - infrared spectra which uses all information contained in the observed spectra while many traditional methods only use a few pixels of the whole spectrum and thus may lose important information .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly describe our sample of mid - infrared spectra . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the pca method , its implementation and the most important principal components ( pcs ) derived from the covariance matrix .",
    "the stability of the mean spectrum and the pcs is then investigated using a bootstrap resampling technique . in section 4 ,",
    "we present eigenvector decomposition of a few selected spectra and discuss the effect of each pc .",
    "our sample of spectra is then divided into eight types according to the sign of the contribution from each pc .",
    "comparison with other diagnostics and other observables are presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , conclusions and discussions are presented in section 6 .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      continuum ratio .",
    "the two horizontal lines with @xmath8 and 1.35 are the zero points for pure agn and starburst , respectively.,width=336,height=288 ]    m equivalent width ( ew@xmath9 ) for all objects in our sample ( open circles - objects with optical spectral type classified as seyfert 1 ; small filled circles - everything else ) .",
    "we divide our objects into four bins of the total contribution of pc2 and pc3 , which are indicated by the vertical dotted lines .",
    "the empty stars represent the median values of the ew@xmath9 for all galaxies in each bin of ( pc2 + pc3 ) and the filled stars represent the median ew6.2 excluding all seyfert 1 type galaxies.,width=336,height=288 ]",
    "veilleux et al . ( 2009 ) presented results from _ spitzer _",
    "_ irs _ observations of 74 ulirgs and 34 palomar green ( pg ) quasars in the local universe ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "they find that the @xmath10 continuum ratio can be used as a surrogate of the pah - free , silicate - free mir / fir ratio to search for agn activity .",
    "there are 59 sources in their analysis which are also included in our sample . in fig .",
    "[ fig : quest ] , we compare the contributions of pc1 in these sources with the @xmath10 continuum ratio . a good correlation between pc1 contribution and the @xmath10 continuum ratio can be seen in the plot .",
    "ulirgs near the zero point for pure agn ( @xmath8 ) have large negative pc1 values .",
    "on the other hand , ulirgs near the zero point for pure starburst ( @xmath8 ) have large positive pc1 values .",
    "the scatter in this correlation seems to increase as pc1 contribution increases which could indicate that pc1 contribution does not correspond directly to agn contribution in objects where the dominant power source is star formation .",
    "another commonly used diagnostic for star formation activity is the pah 6.2 @xmath12 m equivalent width ( ew6.2 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew62 ] , we compare the total contribution of pc2 and pc3 with ew6.2 for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "in general , objects with large ew6.2 have large positive ( pc2+pc3 ) contribution and objects with negligible ew6.2 have large negative ( pc2+pc3 ) contribution .",
    "a few galaxies with optical spectral type classified as seyfert 1 have near zero pah emission at 6.2 @xmath12 m but positive ( pc2+pc3 ) contribution .",
    "this is because in these objects , there are large negative contributions from pc1 which results in negative pah features .",
    "so , a positive total contribution from pc2 and pc3 is used to cancel out these negative pah features .",
    "spoon et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used the equivalent width ( ew ) of the 6.2 @xmath2 pah feature and the optical depth of the 9.7 @xmath2 silicate feature as a new diagnostic tool to divide galaxies into various classes ranging from continuum - dominated agn hot dust spectra and pah - dominated starburst spectra to absorption - dominated spectra of deeply obscured galactic nuclei .",
    "[ fig : spoonclass ] shows the mean spectra of the eight classes defined in spoon et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and the reconstructed spectra using the first three or four pcs .",
    "clearly , the first three pcs already provide an accurate reconstruction for all classes .",
    "[ fig : class_reconstruction2 ] shows the contribution of each pc to each class .",
    "the class 1a spectrum is a nearly featureless hot dust continuum with very weak silicate absorption centred at @xmath13 .",
    "it is mainly composed of a large negative pc1 and a large negative pc2 .",
    "the former results in weak silicate absorption and a blue spectrum and the latter causes weak pahs .",
    "the class 1b spectrum clearly shows pah emission in addition to a hot dust continuum .",
    "its spectral decomposition is similar to that of the class 1a , however , the class 1b also requires a large positive pc3 to show strong pah features .         in the class 1c ,",
    "we see strong pah emissions caused by large positive pc3 .",
    "the class 2c spectrum is similar to class 1c apart from stronger silicate absorption and steeper 20 - 30 @xmath2 continuum .",
    "accordingly , the class 2c has a large positive pc2 , positive pc3 and positive pc1 .",
    "the class 2b spectrum has weaker pahs than class 2c .",
    "it has a large positive pc1 , positive pc3 and negative pc2 .",
    "the class 3b has stronger silicate absorption than 2b .",
    "it has a positive pc1 and negative pc3 .",
    "a negative pc3 contributes most to the class 3a which has the maximum silicate absorption .",
    "it confirms that a negative contribution from pc3 both reduces pah emission and deepens silicate absorption .",
    "the class 2a , dominated by a large negative pc3 and pc1 , has weaker silicate absorption than 3a .    in spoon et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , galaxies are found to distribute along two branches in the plane defined by the 6.2 @xmath2 pah ew and the 9.7 @xmath2 silicate absorption strength . for galaxies with strong star formation , we expect to see a positive total contribution from pc2 and pc3 . on the other hand , for galaxies with weak or no pah features , the total contribution from pc2 and pc3 should be negative .",
    "in other words , the sum of pc2 and pc3 can serve as an approximate measure of the intensity of star formation activity .",
    "the contribution from pc1 corresponds to the strength of silicate absorption . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc_distribution2 ] , we plot the sum of pc2 and pc3 against pc1 where a pattern similar to the fork diagram presented in spoon et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is seen . the horizontal branch in the fork diagram in spoon et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , from 1a , 1b to 1c with increasing pah equivalent width at 6.2 @xmath2 roughly corresponds to the diagonal line going from the bottom left corner to the top right corner .",
    "similarly , the diagonal branch in the fork diagram , from 3a , 2b to 1c with decreasing silicate absorption strength and increasing pah equivalent width at 6.2 @xmath2 , seems to roughly correspond to the diagonal line going from the top left corner to the bottom right corner .",
    "we emphasise that fig .",
    "[ fig : pc_distribution2 ] does not show a complete fork diagram . to see the horizontal fork ( 1a-1b-1c ) in full glory ,",
    "the non - ulirg agn sample needs to be included as well .",
    "we also note that there are more transition sources showing up in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc_distribution2 ] compared to the fork diagram .",
    "this is because we have included sources from other spitzer ulirg programs besides the gto sources used in spoon et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "nardini et al .",
    "( 2008 ; 2009 ) analysed the contribution agn and starbursts to the bolometric luminosity based on a 5 - 8 @xmath2 region of the spectra .",
    "they found evidence for agn activity for @xmath370% of their sample which consists of 71 ulirgs at @xmath14 .",
    "55 objects in their sample are found in our dataset .",
    "the agn emission is modelled as a featureless power law @xmath15 with an exponential attenuation @xmath16 , where the optical depth is supposed to follow @xmath17 .",
    "the sb template is built upon five brightest pure starbursts . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nardini ] , we have plotted the contribution from pc3 as a function of nardini et al.s estimate of the agn contribution to the bolometric infrared luminosity .",
    "we can see a clear correlation between contributions from pc3 and @xmath18 .",
    "it supports the idea that a negative contribution from pc3 turns on agn activity as discussed in the above sections .",
    "[ fig : opticalclasses ] shows the distribution of objects in the pc1-pc4 plane , colour - coded by their optical classifications including hii , liner , seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 . clearly , this distribution is non - gaussian which means ` pc4 ' can not be interpreted as a proper pc .",
    "however , we can say that the few spectra which need large pc4 contributions are outside the parameter space spanned by the first three pcs .",
    "the most obvious feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalclasses ] is that almost all seyfert 1 type galaxies have a large negative pc4 contribution while objects of other types have a mean zero pc4 contribution with a small scatter .",
    "it shows again that pc4 has a remarkably good correspondence with optical qsos .",
    "this is the first time to our knowledge that principal component analysis has been applied to mid - infrared spectra .",
    "it is a simple yet powerful analysis tool .",
    "the first principal component pc1 mainly constrains the dust temperature and the geometry of the distribution of source and dust .",
    "both the second and the third principal component , pc2 and pc3 , seem to regulate the intensity of star formation activity .",
    "in addition , a large negative contribution from the third principal component corresponds to a brightening agn . for a few sources with spectral features indicating a dominant agn ( e.g. silicate emission , strong [ nev ] ) , the first three principal components are not enough in order to accurately reproduce the observed spectra and a fourth principal component is required .",
    "using principal component analysis , we are effectively finding an orthogonal basis to describe the variance which is assumed to fully characterise the objects under study .",
    "so the question is what mechanism / physics is causing spectra to vary .",
    "are spectral differences related to different evolutionary stages of the ulirg population ?",
    "if so , by adding a positive or negative contribution from each pc to adjust the relative strength of various features ( e.g. pah emission , silicate absorption , spectral slope ) , the evolutionary stages of ulirgs are modified . in this paper , we have compared our principal component analysis with various other diagnostics ( such as the @xmath10 continuum ratio , the pah 6.2 @xmath12 m equivalent width and 9.7 @xmath12 m silicate absorption strength ) .",
    "there are some tentative evidence that the principal components are linked to the evolutionary stages .",
    "the effect of each pc on the evolution of the ulirg population will be further investigated using radiative transfer models in a future paper .",
