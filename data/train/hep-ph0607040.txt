    "qcd perturbation theory in the spacelike ( euclidean ) domain is based on a power - series expansion in terms of the running ( effective ) coupling @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 ) , which in one - loop order reads @xmath5 with @xmath6 ,  @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , and with the `` normalized '' coupling @xmath9 satisfying the renormalization - group equation @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are auxiliary expansion parameters ( see appendix [ rg - solution ] and also section iii in ref .",
    "the one - loop solution of this equation suffers from an artificial singularity at @xmath13 , called the landau pole .",
    "this prevents the application of perturbative qcd in the low - momentum spacelike regime with the effect that hadronic quantities , calculated at the partonic level in terms of a power - series expansion in the running coupling , are not well defined . besides , from the theoretical point of view , such ghost singularities contradict causality rendering a spectral klln ",
    "lehmann representation meaningless . on the other hand , in the timelike",
    ", minkowski , region ( @xmath14 ) the definition of the running coupling turns out to be difficult .",
    "the origin of the problem is that the qcd perturbative expansion can not be defined in a direct way in this domain .",
    "many efforts have been made since the early days of qcd to define an appropriate coupling parameter in minkowski space in order to describe crucial timelike processes like the @xmath15 annihilation into hadrons , quarkonium and @xmath16-lepton decays into hadrons , etc .",
    "most of these attempts  see , for instance , @xcite  were based on the analytic continuation of the strong coupling from the deep euclidean region , where perturbative qcd calculations are safely performed , to the minkowski space , where physical measurements are carried out . over the years , it became clear that in the infrared ( ir ) , the strong coupling may reach a stable fixed point and cease to increase .",
    "this behavior would imply that color forces may saturate at this low - momentum scale meaning that gluons decouple from quarks because they `` see '' them as a whole , i.e. , in a quasi colorless configuration .",
    "cornwal @xcite studied , within a vortex - condensate formalism , the formation of a mass gap , or effective gluon mass , that prevents the strong coupling becoming infinite at the landau pole .",
    "similar attempts were undertaken by other authors in subsequent years @xcite using different techniques , but basing their arguments on the gluon acquiring an effective mass that works like an ir regulator in the low - momentum region .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this version of the ir - protected strong coupling can be related to the sudakov factor for the non - emission of soft gluons , in the sense that gluons with wavelengths above some characteristic ( nonperturbative ) length scale , can not resolve individual quarks because these segregate into a colorless mock - hadron state .",
    "in separate parallel developments , radyushkin @xcite , and krasnikov and pivovarov @xcite have obtained analytic expressions for the one - loop running coupling ( and its powers ) directly in minkowski space using an integral transformation from the spacelike to the timelike regime reverse to that for the adler @xmath17-function ( for more details , we refer the interested reader to @xcite ) .",
    "this sort of analytic coupling in the timelike region was rediscovered in the context of the resummation of fermion bubbles by beneke and braun @xcite and also by ball , beneke , and braun in @xcite , the latter work in connection with techniques and applications to the @xmath16 hadronic width .",
    "a systematic approach , termed analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) , has emerged in the last decade from studies initiated by shirkov and solovtsov @xcite .",
    "the main quantity of this framework is the spectral density with the aid of which an analytic running coupling is defined in the euclidean region using a spectral representation .",
    "the same spectral density can be used to define the running coupling in the timelike region having recourse to the dispersion relation for the adler function @xcite .",
    "these integral transformations , called @xmath18 and @xmath19 operations ( see next section ) , coincide with those invented in @xcite and provide the possibility to define simultaneously an analytic running coupling in both the euclidean and the minkowski space . meanwhile this analytic approach has been extended beyond the one - loop level @xcite and important techniques for numerical calculations have been developed @xcite .",
    "the approach has already been applied to the calculation of several hadronic quantities , important examples being the inclusive decay of a @xmath16-lepton into hadrons @xcite , the momentum - scale and scheme dependence of the bjorken @xcite and the gross ",
    "llewellyn smith sum rule @xcite , @xmath20 decays into hadrons @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , it has been extended to processes , like the @xmath21 transition form factor @xcite and the pion s electromagnetic form factor at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of qcd perturbation theory @xcite , processes that contain more than a single perturbative scale , accounting also for sudakov suppression .",
    "overall , this analytic approach ( see for some review @xcite ) does provide a quite reliable description of hadronic quantities in qcd , though there is also criticism @xcite and alternative proposals and views of how to avert singularities in the running coupling @xcite  in particular concerning the deep ir region @xmath22 , where eventually the presence of a non - vanishing hadronic mass may become important @xcite .",
    "it also suffers severe limitations in concept and application to processes beyond the leading order ( lo ) of qcd perturbation theory because it assumes that the only quantities that have to be analytic in the complex @xmath23 plane are the running coupling and its integer powers .",
    "but it was shown in @xcite that typical three - point functions , like the electromagnetic or pion - photon transition form factor , at the nlo level of perturbative qcd , and beyond , contain typical logarithms depending on an additional scale that serves as a factorization or evolution scale .",
    "these logarithms , though not affecting the landau singularity , do contribute to the spectral density .",
    "this has led karanikas and stefanis ( ks ) @xcite to extend the concept of analyticity ( the dispersion relations ) from the level of the coupling and its powers to the level of qcd hadronic amplitudes as a whole .",
    "this generalized encompassing version of the analyticity requirement demands that all terms that may contribute to the spectral density , i.e. , affect the discontinuity across the cut along the negative real axis @xmath24 , must be included into the `` analytization '' procedure .",
    "the implementation of the ks analyticity postulate entails the extension of the original apt to non - integer ( fractional ) powers of the running coupling , which , in particular , encompasses the logarithms of the factorization ( evolution ) scale just mentioned .    in this context",
    "it is worth emphasizing that fractional powers of the strong coupling were considered implicitly in @xcite .",
    "the systematic development of the fractional analytic perturbation theory ( fapt ) for qcd in the euclidean space was recently carried out in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a brief introduction ) and was applied in @xcite to the factorized part of the pion s electromagnetic form factor that epitomizes three - point functions in perturbative qcd .",
    "the pivotal advantage of this scheme is the diminished sensitivity of the perturbative result on the factorization scale that parallels the strong renormalization - scheme independence , already established within apt at the nlo level with respect to the same observable , in the exhaustive in - depth analysis of @xcite ( an abridged version of which is given in @xcite  see also @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to extend this analytic framework to the minkowski space twining the two regions , spacelike and timelike , for any real index and any argument of the couplings and creating a new calculational paradigm for applications to hadronic observables in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "the formal discussion of the main characteristics of fapt in minkowski space ( for which we use the abbreviation mfapt ) is carried out for two- and three - loop running - coupling parameters , investigating also the convergence properties of this type of expansion . to assess the consequences of mfapt for observables and elaborate on its advantages in detail ,",
    "it is best to study a quantity at a high - loop order of perturbation theory . to this end",
    ", we consider the correlator of two scalar bottom - quark currents , whose imaginary part @xmath25 is directly proportional to the decay width of a scalar higgs boson to a bottom - antibottom pair .",
    "considerable progress has been achieved with respect to this quantity during the last few years mainly thanks to the efforts of chetyrkin and collaborators @xcite . in the present investigation",
    "we will provide estimates for @xmath25 within multiloop mfapt , using exclusively the scheme , and compare them with previous various results within conventional perturbative qcd up to the order @xmath26 .",
    "the evolution effects due to the running of the strong coupling and the heavy - quark mass will be calculated up to three loops , borrowing the corresponding four - loop expansion coefficient for the adler function from @xcite .",
    "we emphasize in this context that our investigation is mainly meant to expose the conceptual advantages of the method , rather than to be used as a phenomenological tool for this quantity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basics ] we provide a mini review of the main features of apt , starting with the euclidean region and completing the section with a discussion of the minkowski domain . though this material is mostly based on previously published works , its presentation here for any _ real _ coupling power is new and has not appeared before in the literature .",
    "section [ sec : mfapt ] is devoted to the generalization and extension of fapt @xcite to timelike momenta , giving rise to mfapt . in this section",
    "we present our main theoretical results and provide the reader with explicit ( but approximate ) two - loop expressions for the analytic powers of the timelike coupling .",
    "similar formal expressions for any ( higher ) loop can be derived along these lines , with the three - loop case being outlined in appendices [ rg - solution ] , [ app : spectr ] , and [ app : anb ] ) .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the initial motivation to invent new couplings was the desire to interrelate the adler @xmath17-function , @xmath29 calculable in the euclidean domain , and the quantity @xmath30 , @xmath31 which is measured in the minkowski region .",
    "both quantities are considered in standard qcd perturbation theory , demanding that the couplings satisfy the renormalization - group ( rg ) equation . in minimal - subtraction renormalization schemes",

    "( [ eq : d ] ) and ( [ eq : r ] ) , are numerical constants .",
    "the functions @xmath17 and @xmath33 can be related to each other via a dispersion relation without any reference to perturbation theory . however , employing a perturbative expansion on the l.h.s . of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) and ( [ eq : r ] ) , one obtains , in fact , a relation between the powers of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while the powers of @xmath38 reveal themselves as numerical parameters . upon setting @xmath39 on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) ( or @xmath40 in eq .",

    "but , if these coupling parameters are the standard running ones , then this connection fails at any loop order because of the landau singularity in the euclidean space .",
    "questions arise whether analytic versions of both types of couplings may exist for which the above expressions could be connected .",
    "we shall see in the next step how this goal can , indeed , be achieved using non - power - series ( functional ) expansions within apt @xcite .          where the last integral is evaluated along the contour shown in fig .",

    "still higher loops can be obtained via an approximate form of the spectral density and numerical integration @xcite .",
    "it follows from this summarized exposition that the difficulties encountered with ghost singularities in the euclidean strong coupling can be eliminated on account of causality ( `` spectrality '' @xcite ) and rg invariance .",
    "hence , from the point of view of the analytic approach , the landau pole remover ( and analogously the compensation of singularities in higher loops ) is not introduced by hand but ensues naturally as a corollary within the formalism without appealing to any nonperturbative physics as the origin of power corrections .",
    "nevertheless , one may include into the spectral density power corrections of the form @xmath74 , with @xmath75 being , for example , a constituent quark mass , in an attempt to incorporate this way some nonperturbative effects .",
