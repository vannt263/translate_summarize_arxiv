    "_ _  _ _ issac newton published his _ principia _ in 1686,principia in which he formulated his three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation that together unified both celestial and terrestial mechanics .",
    "he used these principles to derive kepler s three laws of planetary motion . in spite of the remarkable success of his mechanics , he was not completely satisfied with his achievement .",
    "newton himself criticized his universal law of gravitation as it required the gravitational force to act instantaneously at a distance without the presence of any medium to transmit it.@xcite however , his gravitation was successfully applied for over 200 _ _",
    "_ _ years before it was superseded by einstein .    in 1905",
    "einstein published his special theory of relativity @xcite that unified space and time and consequently made mechanics consistent with electromagnetism .",
    "einstein realized that newton s principle of gravitation was incompatible with the special theory of relativity .",
    "newtonian mechanics presumes the existence of an absolute space and an absolute time in which the propagation of the gravitational interaction is instantaneous.@xcite the special theory of relativity postulates the constancy of the speed of light that unifies the concepts of space and time into a four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "instantaneous propagation of the gravitational interaction in one coordinate system would mean retarded or accelerated propagation in another .",
    "einstein began to work on the problem of gravity soon after he published the special theory of relativity.@xcite his first attempt was to modify special relativity by using a speed of light depending on the gravitational field , but it was unsuccessful .",
    "when he returned to zurich from prague in 1912 he began a new approach based on non - euclidian geometry .",
    "his friend marcel grossmann , a mathematician , helped him learn the absolute differential calculus  ( or tensor analysis as it is now called ) developed by ricci and levi - civita.@xcite together they formulated a new theory of gravitation .",
    "but later they rejected the first version for not having the correct newtonian limit.@xcite after much searching einstein finally formulated a theory of gravity in 1915 - 1916 that was called the general theory of relativity.@xcite    in most presentations of einstein s general theory of relativity@xcite his gravitational field equation is given in tensor form as embodying some general principles .",
    "it is then shown that in the limit of weak gravity and small speeds it reduces to newtonian gravity.@xcite this top - down approach makes it difficult for the student to understand the gravitational field equation . in this paper",
    "we use a bottom - up approach to obtain einstein s field equation from newton s universal gravitation .",
    "it should be noted that einstein s field equation is not the only generalization of the newton s universal gravitation but there could be other possible and more complicated generalizations as well .",
    "however we restrict ourself to obtain einstein s field equation from newton s universal gravitation .",
    "we begin with poisson s equation and use a natural step - by - step process of generalization . in the next section we review newtonian gravity and poisson s equation for the gravitational potential . in sec .",
    "3 newton s gravitational potential is shown to be related to the @xmath0-component of the metric tensor by equating the nonrelativistic result of the principle of stationary proper time to the classical lagrangian for a particle in a gravitational potential .",
    "poisson s equation for the potential can then be written in terms of the second derivative of the @xmath0-component of the metric . in sec .",
    "4 we generalize this equation by using a cyclic linear combination of second derivatives of the metric tensor to obtain the curvature of a four - dimensional spacetime . the resultant is the @xmath0-component of the ricci tensor in local coordinates . in sec .",
    "5 the mass density in the poisson equation is related to the @xmath0-component of the energy - momentum stress tensor and its trace.@xcite using the principle of general covariance @xcite in sec .",
    "6 , the single component of the tensor equation in local coordinates is generalized to obtain all components of the einstein s gravitational field equation .",
    "our approach goes beyond other papers that make einstein s gravitational field equation plausible.@xcite the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "7 and the appendix gives a brief review of the riemann and ricci tensors .",
    "newton s universal law of gravity@xcite states that the attractive force @xmath1 on mass @xmath2 at @xmath3 by a mass @xmath4 at @xmath5 is given by @xmath6where @xmath7 is newton s universal gravitation constant , the displacement between the particles is @xmath8 and the corresponding unit vector is @xmath9    because of the principle of superposition , the total gravitational force on a test particle of mass @xmath2 at position @xmath10 by particles of mass @xmath11 at positions @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is    @xmath14    if the group of masses in eq .",
