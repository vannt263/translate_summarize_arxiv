    "the experimental investigation of the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1xe has been started more then 20 years ago . but",
    "both two neutrino and neutrinoless modes of this process for @xmath1xe was not observed .",
    "the results of last experiments are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the theoretical estimations of half lifetime for @xmath3-decay are presented in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "it is necessary to mention that in @xcite only one spectrum ( measured with enriched @xmath1xe ) was obtained . to calculate their limit",
    "it was assumed that at any effect / background ratio in the energy range under investigation the effect did not exceed the actually measured background increased by a systematic error given in @xmath5 units ( @xmath5 is a standart deviation ) . in our work",
    "the measurements were performed with both enriched xenon and natural xenon simultaneously .         to evaluate the @xmath6-effect the energy spectra in region 2312@xmath72646 kev were analyzed .",
    "the data for the analysis @xmath8-mode have been taken for 17280 hours of measurements .",
    "this energy region is determined from calculated energy resolution for 2479 kev electrons ( r=7.0@xmath9 , @xmath10 kev ) and systematic error in definition of peak position ( @xmath11 kev ) .",
    "number of events in the energy region @xmath12 kev registered by cpc _ _ n__1 and cpc _ _ n__2 in each run of measurements are presented in table [ tab4 ] . using recommendation given in @xcite and assuming that mean background is 10 events and measured one is 8 events , we obtain : @xmath13 where @xmath14 h @xmath15 yr and @xmath16 .",
