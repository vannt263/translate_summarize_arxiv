    "competing interactions generally give rise to complex behavior .",
    "this is particularly true for magnetic systems , where the interplay of magnetic interactions between nearest , next nearest , and further neighbors can lead to complex magnetic ordering and frustration . in the case of rare earth intermetallic compounds , magnetic exchange between localized rare earth moments",
    "is mediated by conduction electrons , giving rise to long range interactions of oscillatory character .",
    "in addition , in most rare earth compounds the magnetism is strongly influenced by the single ion anisotropy due to the crystal electric field , notably manifesting in the presence of metamagnetic transitions .",
    "systems based on trivalent gd and divalent eu , with a pure spin configuration @xmath3 and @xmath4 , provide the unique opportunity of studying the effect of exchange in the absence of single - ion anisotropy . since spherically symmetric , such a configuration is inert to the crystal electric field and compounds based on gd@xmath5 or eu@xmath2 are expected to have at most a small magnetic anisotropy .",
    "eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 , the eu homologue of the paradigmatic heavy fermion ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite and the kondo antiferromagnet cerh@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite , is a metal which orders antiferromagnetically below t@xmath6k @xcite .",
    "so far , little is known about the magnetic structure of eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 .",
    "early mssbauer spectroscopy measurements  @xcite on polycrystals determined that the eu spins lie in the basal plane at 4.1k but neither the magnetic propagation vector nor the orientation close to t@xmath7 of the ordered moments have been determined .",
    "more recent work on polycrystalline samples revealed features at roughly 23 and 25k in magnetization and specific heat , and metamagnetism at low temperatures  @xcite . here , we report the physical properties of eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 single crystals .",
    "this compound presents a sizeable magnetic anisotropy both in the paramagnetic and the ordered phases , in spite of the absence of crystal field effects .",
    "we show that in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 different magnetic structures are close in energy , giving rise to complex magnetism .",
    "we identify a third phase transition occurring at @xmath8k , likely into a spin spiral magnetic structure , which undergoes a metamagnetic transition at low fields possibly into a fan structure .",
    "the eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 single crystals were synthesized as described in ref .",
    "the structure was characterized by powder x - ray diffraction on a crushed crystal , using cu k@xmath9 radiation and lab@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) as an internal standard .",
    "the chemical composition was checked by energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) .",
    "heat capacity and four - point resistivity measurements were performed in a quantum design ppms system .",
    "magnetization data were taken using a quantum design mpms squid magnetometer .",
    "the chemical composition determined by edx microprobe analysis was ( @xmath12)at% eu , ( @xmath13)at% rh and ( @xmath13)at% si .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements confirmed a tetragonal structure for the crystals , with lattice parameters a@xmath14 , and c@xmath15 , in agreement with the values published for polycrystalline samples  @xcite .",
    "no secondary phases were detected .",
    "laue images show that the crystals grow preferentially along the basal plane , with the shortest dimension ( typically 500 - 900@xmath16 m ) along the * c * axis .",
    "magnetic susceptibility data as a function of temperature in different applied fields ( h ) are shown in figure  [ mvst ] for h@xmath17 and h@xmath18 .",
    "there is a sizeable anisotropy , susceptibility for h@xmath17 being larger than for h@xmath18 .",
    "the anisotropy at low fields can not be explained by the sample shape although the platelets are wide and thin .",
    "the susceptibility ratio between the two field orientations is 1.6 at 40k and 5.3 at 23k . above @xmath19k susceptibility",
    "follows a curie - weiss behavior both for h@xmath17 as well as h@xmath18 .",
    "the effective magnetic moment @xmath20@xmath21 is the same for both field directions and close in value to that expected for eu@xmath2 ( 7.94@xmath21 ) .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature @xmath22 is positive for both field orientations indicating a dominant ferromagnetic exchange , with @xmath23k somewhat larger than @xmath24k but both nevertheless close in absolute value to the ordering temperature .",
    "since for eu@xmath2 the magnetic moment has purely spin character and no crystal field effects are expected , the large anisotropy observed in the susceptibility close to t@xmath7 results from a rather moderate exchange anisotropy ( @xmath25% ) ; this effect is enhanced by the divergence of the susceptibility upon approaching the curie - weiss temperature due to the global ferromagnetic nature of the exchange .",
    "since @xmath0 electrons are well localized , the magnetic coupling must be indirect through the conduction electrons ( rkky ) .",
    "this also explains the difference in ordering temperature with its homologue gdrh@xmath1si@xmath1 ( t@xmath26k )  @xcite , since the different valence states of the two rare earths imply an additional @xmath27 electron in the conduction band for gd@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the anisotropy of the exchange in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 implies some spin - orbit effects on the electronic states close to the fermi level .    in a simple molecular field picture , a ferromagnetic curie - weiss temperature very close in absolute value to the actual antiferromagnetic ordering temperature points out to a strong coupling within each ferromagnetic sublattice and a much weaker intersublattice coupling . a comparison across the rare earth ( r ) series of the magnetic properties of rrh@xmath1si@xmath1 compounds , shows that in all reported cases there is a transition to an antiferromagnetically ordered state at a temperature t@xmath7 that scales roughly with the de gennes expression @xmath28 for the heavy rare earths ( gd to yb ) and departs considerably from it for the light rare earths ( ce to eu )  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the magnetic structure of rrh@xmath1si@xmath1 has been determined for most members of the series  @xcite and has been found to be predominantly of type i , with rare earth moments ordering ferromagnetically in the basal plane and stacking antiferromagnetically along * c * , i.e. with a propagation vector @xmath29 .",
    "this ubiquity of ferromagnetic planes antiferromagnetically stacked along * c * suggests a similar kind of ordering for eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 .    upon cooling below 25k ,",
    "a double feature is observed at t@xmath30=24.5k and t@xmath1=23.2k in the susceptibility at low fields , below which the susceptibility decreases rapidly for h@xmath17 and much more gradually for h@xmath18.the characteristic temperatures of these anomalies are only weakly dependent on h@xmath18 , but for h@xmath17 the feature at t@xmath30 is rapidly suppressed , merging with that at t@xmath1 already in a field of 350oe .",
    "all this hints towards an antiferromagnetic order with an easy plane perpendicular to the * c * axis .",
    "indeed , early mssbauer experiments performed on eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 determined that the moment lies in the basal plane at 4.2 k  @xcite .    below @xmath31k",
    "a further anomaly is observed .",
    "susceptibility increases upon cooling for h@xmath17 and drops strongly for h@xmath18 . for lower temperatures",
    ", an irreversibility between zero - field - cooled and field - cooled curves appears , indicating the presence of a ferromagnetic component .",
    "comparison with magnetization curves as a function of applied field in figure  [ mvsh ] reveals that at the lowest fields ( h@xmath32oe ) the irreversibility is most probably a parasitic effect , while it is related to the presence of a metamagnetic transition at somewhat higher fields .",
    "the presence of magnetic anisotropy is also evident from magnetization curves in figure  [ mvsh ] .",
    "for h@xmath33 , a step - like hysteretic increase of roughly 4@xmath21 in magnetization occurs at low temperatures and fields , beyond which magnetization increases continuously with field , reaching the saturation moment of 7@xmath21 per eu atom at @xmath34koe .",
    "although such behavior is reminiscent of the spin flop transition occurring in antiferromagnets with weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy when field is applied in the easy direction , it is striking to observe it in this eu system where no crystal field effects are present , so that the magnetization is expected to evolve continuosly as a function of h@xmath17 .",
    "the abrupt increase observed in magnetization suggests rather a flipping of the moments of whole ferromagnetic planes , analogous to the case of tbrh@xmath1si@xmath1 . in the latter , which at zero field presents a type i magnetic structure ( i.e. a stacking @xmath35 of ferromagnetic planes along the easy axis * c * ) , a field of @xmath36 t parallel to * c * induces an abrupt transition to a stacking of the form @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one could think that the abrupt metamagnetic transition observed in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 occurs when the energy barrier separating antiferromagnetic and ferri- or ferromagnetic configurations is suddenly overcome by the magnetic field .",
    "for example , a flipping of every fourth layer would result in a magnetization change of 3.5@xmath21 .",
    "however , in contrast to tbrh@xmath1si@xmath1 , which is a system with a strong ising character , eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 is an easy plane system where hardly any differences are observed when applying the field along [ 110 ] instead of [ 100 ] .",
    "it seems then unlikely that it should take a finite field in the easy plane to flip the orientation of a ferromagnetic layer .",
    "another source of sharp metamagnetism is the transition from a spin spiral ( or screw ) structure to a fan ( or sinusoid ) structure , as occurs in mnp : the application of a field perpendicular to the hard direction * a * induces a first order transition from a spiral magnetic structure with propagation vector along * a * and moments in the * bc * plane to a fan structure with propagation vector along * a * but where the moments oscillate in the * bc * plane around the field direction  @xcite . in any case , the energy barrier separating both spin structures in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 is very small ( @xmath38k ) .    in the case of h@xmath18 , the hard magnetic axis ,",
    "the magnetization increases much more slowly upon increasing field , and the full eu moment is not recovered up to 50koe .",
    "a small broad hysteretic magnetization jump is visible at low temperatures for fields above 2500oe , but it is not clear whether this feature is intrinsic to the magnetism in the hard direction or due to a small field component along the easy plane originating from a slight sample misalignment .    the specific heat as a function of temperature in figure  [ figure2 ] exhibits anomalies at 24.8k and 23.5k , consistent with those observed in the magnetic susceptibility at t@xmath30 and t@xmath1 . a small broad anomaly is also detected close to t@xmath39 .",
    "it must be noticed that the standard evaluation of the specific heat performed by ppms ( black circles in figure  [ figure2 ] ) assumes that the sample specific heat remains constant during and after the application of the heat pulse . if the specific heat of the sample varies strongly over a small temperature range , as in a first order transition , the values extracted by the standard ppms evaluation procedure are not reliable .",
    "we have therefore performed a slope analysis of the relaxation data in the vicinity of t@xmath39  @xcite , using either the warming or cooling part of the curve .",
    "the results are plotted in the inset of figure  [ figure2 ] : a small but clear specific heat jump is revealed at t@xmath39 , which presents a small hysteresis ( 0.2k ) between warming and cooling data .",
    "these features are robust , unlike the oscillations observed in the lower temperature range which are affected by the analysis parameters ( averaging width and excluded initial region ) .",
    "this indicates that a thermodynamic first - order phase transition occurs at t@xmath39 .    in isotropic systems without single ion anisotropy ,",
    "the evolution of the specific heat as a function of temperature and in particular the specific heat jump at t@xmath40 can provide information about the type of magnetic order  @xcite .",
    "the specific heat jump at t@xmath30 is similar in magnitude to the value proposed for a ( collinear ) amplitude modulated structure ( 13.43 j / mol k )  @xcite , ruling out simple antiferromagnetic , helical and cycloidal equal - moment structures just below t@xmath30 .",
    "it must be noticed that if anisotropic exchange is explicitly considered , non - collinear amplitude - modulated structures can form  @xcite , presenting a somewhat higher specific heat jump at t@xmath7 .",
    "however , the fact that it is very difficult to align the moments to a field parallel to the * c * axis suggests the moments are confined to the basal plane .",
    "such amplitude - modulated magnetic structures usually undergo for entropic reasons a first order transition upon cooling into an equal - moment structure which can have a different propagation vector , or evolve into a squared - up arrangement with the development of components at higher order harmonics of the propagation vector  @xcite .",
    "since t@xmath30 and t@xmath1 are very close , in a first approximation the sum of the specific heat jumps at t@xmath30 and t@xmath1 should be similar to the magnetic specific heat change that would be expected for a single transition occuring at t@xmath1 .",
    "this value is close to that expected for equal - moment structures , suggesting the transition at t@xmath1 is to an equal - moment state . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition at t@xmath39 is first - order in nature , hinting to a different symmetry of the magnetic states above and below t@xmath39 . at low temperatures , the characteristic broad schottky - like bump  @xcite present in 4@xmath41 magnetic systems at t@xmath42",
    "can be observed in the specific heat .",
    "since no specific heat data are available for a@xmath2rh@xmath1si@xmath1 , the phonon contribution was estimated from the specific heat data of isostructural lu@xmath5rh@xmath1si@xmath1 , from which an electronic contribution with a sommerfeld coefficient of 7 mj / k@xmath43mol was subtracted  @xcite .",
    "the debye temperature for the lu compound is expected to be higher because of the additional binding provided by the @xmath44 electron . in order to account for the change in the characteristic debye temperature due to the divalent configuration of eu in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 , a rescaling of the debye temperature @xmath45 was considered in the estimation of the phonon contribution , so that the magnetic entropy rln8 expected for eu@xmath2 atoms with a j=7/2 moment is fully recovered at t@xmath46 , where the contribution of magnetic fluctuations is expected to be negligible . a nuclear contribution ( evident at very low t ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and a conduction band contribution estimated to 25 mj / k@xmath43  @xcite were subtracted in order to obtain the magnetic specific heat .",
    "the magnetic entropy estimated in this manner reaches 0.93rln8 at t@xmath30 , see figure  [ figure2 ] .",
    "the missing entropy ( 7% of rln8 ) is less than expected from numerical calculations of simple magnetic lattices ( 14 - 20% ) , indicating that short - range fluctuations above t@xmath47 are comparatively weak  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ resistivity ] shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath48 normalized to its zero - field value at room temperature . upon cooling from room temperature",
    ", the resistivity first decreases roughly linearly but then gradually reduces its slope , as is characteristic for the phonon scattering contribution in a metal .",
    "below t@xmath30 the resistivity drops more rapidly on entering the magnetically ordered phase , consistent with the reduction in spin - disorder scattering , and below t@xmath1 , a stronger suppression of the resistivity takes place with @xmath49 being one order of magnitude larger than in the paramagnetic phase . for the homologue compound gdrh@xmath1si@xmath1",
    ", the resistivity slope increases only a factor of @xmath50 below t@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that spin - flip scattering is particularly strong in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 .",
    "a small broad anomaly in @xmath49 could be distinguished at t@xmath39 .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio @xmath51 indicates the high quality of the crystals and corresponds to a residual resistivity is of the order of 1@xmath52  cm .",
    "the zero - field resistivity data can be fitted above 30k with the expression    @xmath53    where the constant @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the residual resistivity and @xmath56 the spin - disorder contribution , while the second term corresponds to the phonon contribution @xmath57 given by the bloch - grneisen expression .",
    "this yields a debye temperature @xmath58k and a spin - disorder contribution @xmath59 . applying a magnetic field along the * c * axis results in a positive transverse magnetoresistance at high temperatures , which is at 14 t roughly a factor 4 larger than for polycrystalline copper  @xcite .",
    "the magnetoresistance ( mr ) becomes large and negative upon cooling towards the nel temperature , reaching 53% at 14 t .",
    "such an important negative magnetoresistance at temperatures around the onset of magnetic order is usually observed for ferromagnets ( for example ni  @xcite , gdni  @xcite , gdal@xmath1  @xcite , gd@xmath1co@xmath1ga  @xcite , gd@xmath1co@xmath1al  @xcite , eu@xmath1cusi@xmath39  @xcite , eufe@xmath1p@xmath1  @xcite ) . in antiferromagnets , on the other hand , a large negative magnetoresistance around t@xmath7 is not systematically observed : while some compounds exhibit a small positive mr only below t@xmath47 ( e.g. gdcu@xmath10  @xcite ,",
    "gdcu@xmath1ge@xmath1  @xcite ) , others show practically no mr ( as gdau@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite or gdpd@xmath1ge@xmath1  @xcite ) and a few ( gdptp  @xcite , eu@xmath60mnbi@xmath61  @xcite ,",
    "eu@xmath39ni@xmath62ga@xmath62  @xcite , gd@xmath63rh@xmath39  @xcite ) have a large negative mr around t@xmath40 .",
    "the latter show often predominantly ferromagnetic interactions , manifest for example as a positive curie - weiss temperature in the paramagnetic susceptibility , as is also the case for eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 .    at low fields ,",
    "the transverse magnetoresistance measured for h@xmath18 is positive for all measured temperatures , see figure  [ mrsummary ] . for both isotherms measured below t@xmath39 ,",
    "a steplike decrease of mr takes place at @xmath64 koe , suggesting the presence of a metamagnetic transition . a comparison with magnetization data ( which are only available up to 50 koe )",
    "suggests that this critical field might correspond to the saturation field .",
    "well above t@xmath39 , at 20k , the steplike decrease is no longer present , but a broad maximum is observed beyond which the magnetoresistance becomes increasingly negative on increasing field .",
    "no substantial change in the shape of the mr curves is observed by heating through t@xmath1 and t@xmath30 into the paramagnetic phase , although the position of the broad maximum varies strongly with temperature . in a relaxation time approximation",
    ", the magnetoresistance follows a universal curve as a function of @xmath65 , where the cyclotron frequency @xmath66 . in `` normal ''",
    "compensated metals the magnetoresistance in the classical regime is always positive because the scattering process itself is not field dependent : the only effect of the field is to modify the electron orbit , thus giving rise to kohler scaling @xmath67 . in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 kohler",
    "scaling breaks down : the broad mr peak moves to fields that are at least a factor of two larger between 20 and 50k , while @xmath55 changes very little in the same temperature range , see figure  [ resistivity ] .",
    "figure  [ mrsummary ] rather suggests a scaling of the form @xmath68 .",
    "a relaxation time @xmath69 is suggestive of spin - flip scattering .",
    "the negative sign accompanying t@xmath30 can easily be accounted for by the ferromagnetic exchange .",
    "this exchange supports the external field in polarizing the local moments and thus in suppressing the spin - flip scattering .",
    "on the other hand we notice that at very low ( 2k ) and very high ( 200 - 300k ) temperatures , where field induces changes on the spin - flip scattering mechanism are weak , the magnetoresistance is positive , almost linear in field ( at least below 100koe ) and of roughly the same absolute size .",
    "thus , the magnetoresistance in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 seems to be essentially a sum of a linear in h `` normal '' metallic contribution and a negative spin - flip related magnetic contribution which scales as h/(t - t@xmath30 ) .",
    "however , an additional effect is needed to explain an enhancement of the positive contribution at low fields in the vicinity of the nel temperature .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a similar scaling of mr @xmath70 was observed in the ferromagnet eufe@xmath1p@xmath1 but erroneously taken as evidence for kondo interactions  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "single crystals of eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 exhibit a marked magnetic anisotropy with the easy plane perpendicular to the * c * in spite of the pure spin character of eu@xmath2 .",
    "the positive curie - weiss temperature close to t@xmath7 in magnitude , together with the comparison to other rrh@xmath1si@xmath1 systems , suggests strong ferromagnetic coupling within the basal plane , and an antiferromagnetic stacking of these planes along * c*. three succesive magnetic transitions occur upon cooling in zero field : a transition from the paramagnetic to an amplitude - modulated state at t@xmath71k , followed closely by a transition at t@xmath72k presumably into an equal - moment magnetic structure , and a third transition which is of the first order into a magnetic state which may be a spin spiral .",
    "the sharp metamagnetic transition observed as a function of field at low temperatures would then be related to a transition from spiral to fan magnetic structure , or be the signature of the collective flipping of some ferromagnetic moments .",
    "this indicates that in eurh@xmath1si@xmath1 several magnetic configurations are very close in energy .",
    "our results may also be relevant to the complex eu magnetism observed in the isoelectronic system eufe@xmath1(as@xmath73p@xmath74)@xmath1 , especially for the transition from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism on increasing @xmath75 .",
