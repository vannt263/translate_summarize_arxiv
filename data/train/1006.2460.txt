    "quantum discord ( qd ) is a measure of quantum correlation defined by ollivier and zurek almost ten years ago @xcite and , yet , a subject of increasing interest today @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , for a bipartite pure state , the definition of qd coincides with that of the entanglement of formation ( eof ) .",
    "but it has remained an open question how those two quantities would be related for general mixed states . here , we present this desired relation for arbitrarily mixed states and show that the eof and the qd obey a monogamic relation . surprisingly , this necessarily requires an extension of the bipartite mixed system to its tripartite purified version .",
    "nonetheless , we obtain a conservation relation for the distribution of eof and qd in the system - the sum of all possible bipartite entanglement shared with a particular subsystem , as given by the eof , can not be increased without increasing , _ by the same amount _ , the sum of all qd shared with this same subsystem . when extended to the case of a tripartite mixed state , this relation results in a new proof of the strong subadditivity of entropy , with stronger bounds depending on the balance between the sum of eof and the sum of qd shared with a particular subsystem .    as an example of the importance of this conservation relation , we explore the distribution of entanglement in the deterministic quantum computation with one single pure qubit and a collection of @xmath0 mixed states ( dqc1 ) .",
    "the algorithm , developed by knill and laflamme @xcite , is able to perform exponentially faster computation of important tasks , @xcite when compared with well - known classical algorithms , without any entanglement between the pure qubit and the mixed ones @xcite .",
    "arguably , the power of the quantum computer is supposed to be related to qd , rather than entanglement @xcite . here , using the conservation relation ,",
    "we have shown that even in the supposedly entanglement - free quantum computation there is a certain amount of multipartite entanglement between the qubits and the environment , which is responsible for the non - zero qd ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .     represents the pure qubit , @xmath1 the maximally mixed state , obtained through maximal entanglement with the environment @xmath2 . from the left to the right , @xmath1 is initially entangled with @xmath2 ( purple bar ) .",
    "the protocol is then executed and @xmath3 , although not directly entangled with @xmath1 , gets entangled with the pair @xmath4 as the qd between @xmath3 and @xmath1 increase . ]",
    "let us first consider an arbitrary system represented by a density matrix @xmath5 with @xmath3 and @xmath1 representing two subsystems and @xmath2 representing the environment .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the environment , here , is constituted by the universe minus the subsystems @xmath3 and @xmath1 , since , in this case , @xmath5 is a pure density matrix .",
    "there is an important monogamic relation between the entanglement of formation ( eof ) @xcite and the classical correlation ( cc ) @xcite between the two subsystems developed by koashi and winter @xcite , that we employ to understand the distribution of entanglement .",
    "it is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the eof between @xmath3 and @xmath1 , @xmath8 is the cc between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and @xmath9 is the usual shannon entropy @xcite of @xmath3 .",
    "further , @xmath10 and analogously for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "explicitly , cc reads @xmath13 $ ] where the maximum is taken over all positive operator valued measurements @xmath14 performed on subsystem @xmath2 , with probability of @xmath15 as an outcome , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "one can easily understand eq .",
    "( [ koashi ] ) .",
    "the entropy @xmath18 measures the amount of correlation ( classical and/or quantum ) between @xmath3 with the external world .",
    "if we divide the external world into two parts , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the amount of quantum correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 , plus the amount of classical correlation between @xmath3 and the complementary part @xmath2 , must be equal to @xmath19 . in this sense , eq .",
    "( [ koashi ] ) poses constraints on the ability that system @xmath3 has to share correlations with other systems . for this reason",
    "it is called a monogamous relation .",
    "we can show a different aspect of eq .",
    "( [ koashi ] ) by adding to both of its sides the mutual information between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , @xmath20 .",
    "after some manipulation we obtain @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the conditional entropy and @xmath23 is the qd between subsystem @xmath3 and the environment @xmath2 .",
    "( [ uni1 ] ) tells us that the entanglement between two arbitrary subsystems , a and b , is related to the quantum discord between one of the subsystems ( a ) and the environment e. it is important to note that , although in eq .",
    "( [ uni1 ] ) the eof is written as a function of the qd between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , it is straightforward to write it as a function of the discord between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath24 . in the same way",
    ", we can evaluate the qd between the subsystems @xmath3 and @xmath1 , @xmath25 which gives the quantum discord between a and b as a function of the entanglement between a and e. remarking that , since the global state is pure , @xmath26 which is in fact the eof of the partition @xmath2 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , minus the eof of the partition @xmath1 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "( [ uni2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 this result shows that the eof and qd obey a very special monogamic relation , involving bipartite and tripartite entanglement .",
    "we now derive a very simple but powerful result regarding the distribution of bipartite entanglement . noting that @xmath32 since @xmath5 is a pure state and summing eq .",
    "( [ uni1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ uni2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath33    this important monogamic distribution of eof and qd can also be viewed as a quantum conservation law :    _ given an arbitrary tripartite pure system , the sum of all possible bipartite entanglement shared with a particular subsystem , as given by the eof , can not be increased without increasing , by the same amount , the sum of all qd shared with this same subsystem . _",
    "this last fundamental result has remarkable implications in the way that entanglement can be distributed among many parties .",
    "for example , we are now able to analyze the power of the quantum computer `` without '' entanglement in view of this last statement . in this sense , let us consider the dqc1 protocol , where the power of one pure qubit was firstly revealed .",
    "it is well - known that any quantum computation executed over @xmath0 maximally mixed states does not give rise to exponential speedup when compared with the classical computation .",
    "however , knill and laflamme @xcite demonstrated that if just one single pure qubit is added to this set , the situation changes dramatically @xcite - for instance , the dqc1 gives an exponential speedup for the computation of the normalized trace of an unitary operator , @xmath34 .",
    "the dqc1 consists of a pure qubit that is represented here by the subsystem @xmath3 and a completely mixed state of @xmath35 qubits , @xmath36 that is represented by @xmath1 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , we observe that initially the subsystem @xmath3 is pure and has zero entanglement and zero discord with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath2 . on the other hand , the subsystem @xmath1 is given by the maximally mixed state .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that even a completely mixed state manifests its _ quantumness _ by the fact that it is impossible to distinguish the infinitely many ensembles that can realize it .",
    "an alternative way to look at this property is to consider it as an entangled state with an external environment which has as many degrees of freedom as necessary to purify the whole system .",
    "thus , we consider here the degree of mixture of @xmath1 as due to the entanglement between an environment @xmath2 , which does not interact with @xmath1 , and @xmath3 .",
    "however , it has interacted with @xmath1 in the past , being thus responsible for its _ mixedness_. this approach has been fundamental for the understanding of important tasks in quantum information like schumacher compression , quantum state merging , and entanglement theory @xcite . given this initial situation , we consider a circuit as that exposed in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we suppose that the subsystem @xmath3 is a qubit in the initial state @xmath37 ( an eigenvector of the pauli matrix @xmath38 ) and apply a hadamard quantum gate , followed by a control unitary on the remaining @xmath35 mixed qubit state . thus , after this process , the state of the subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath1 is given by @xmath39 since it gives a separated state with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath1 @xcite . expanding the state on the eigenstate basis @xmath40 of the unitary operator @xmath41 with eigenvalues @xmath42 and considering the purifying system eigenbasis @xmath43 , the joint @xmath44 state can be written as @xmath45 thus the expectation values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 on @xmath3",
    "provide the normalized trace of @xmath41 : @xmath48 and @xmath49 . at the end of the process , just before the measurement that determines @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we will have finite qd between @xmath3 and @xmath1 , @xmath52 @xcite , but no entanglement between them , @xmath53@xcite . using the results given in eq .",
    "( [ uni2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ unix ] ) , we meticulously examine the eof and the qd distribution . for this purpose ,",
    "we examine how the initial entanglement between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is affected during the computation . according to eq .",
    "( [ uni2 ] ) , @xmath54 , but from eq .",
    "( [ rhodq ] ) , @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , we see that @xmath56 , an so there really is no bipartite entanglement between @xmath3 with @xmath1 or @xmath2 . but in a similar fashion to eq .",
    "( [ uni21 ] ) we can write @xmath57 allowing us to analyze the eof and the qd distribution in the qdc1 . prior the computation , @xmath58 , and @xmath59",
    ". however , @xmath60 increases after the controlled unitary operation , implying necessarily in a redistribution of the entanglement between the parties . in order to @xmath60 to increase",
    "some multipartite entanglement @xmath61 must exist .",
    "this entanglement is indeed signaled by the mixed state of @xmath3 alone after the computation .",
    "furthermore , using eq .",
    "( [ unix ] ) , it is straightforward to show that for the dqc1 this entanglement unbalance can be measured by the qd between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , since @xmath62 and finally @xmath63 nevertheless , it is important to emphasize that the power of the quantum computer does not come only from the entanglement present between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or even between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the dqc1 , it is clear that it comes from the protocol ability to redistribute entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "this property is intrinsic of the protocol and does not rely on the particularities of the environment .",
    "the dqc1 protocol ability to transfer entanglement and its efficiency against classical algorithms for special tasks can be tested in the light of the subsystem @xmath1 initial entanglement with @xmath2 .",
    "had we started with a non - maximally mixed state for @xmath1 , meaning a non - maximally entanglement with @xmath2 , instead of eq .",
    "( [ rhodq ] ) , one would have ended up with @xmath64 in this case @xmath65 or @xmath66 gives @xmath67 $ ] @xcite containing , thus , less information about the trace of @xmath41 when @xmath1 is initially less entangled with @xmath2 .",
    "the worst case is when @xmath1 is in a definite state @xmath68 ( no entanglement with e ) , when we have access to only one eigenvalue of @xmath41 .",
    "curiously this corresponds to the situation where a maximal entanglement between @xmath3 and @xmath1 would be available at the end , which certainly does not contribute to any speedup for this special purpose .",
    "therefore , we suggest that one should look carefully at the redistribution of entanglement during any quantum computation , and its implication for the speedup of certain protocols . in the present situation , we see that this ability for entanglement redistribution is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) ingredient for efficient quantum computation .",
    "at this point , one could imagine what would be the implications of such a relation when some information is lacking for the description of the global state , i. e. , when the tripartite state involving systems @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is mixed .",
    "in that case eq . ( [ koashi ] ) becomes an inequality @xcite and , therefore , eq .",
    "( [ uni1 ] ) turns into @xmath69 similarly , by changing @xmath1 for @xmath2 in the equation above , it now reads @xmath70 , which when added to eq .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) gives @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the balance between the entanglement and the quantum discord in the system .",
    "the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) can be stronger than the strong subadditivity ( ss ) @xcite , @xmath73 depending on @xmath74 .",
    "for @xmath75 it gives a remarkable lower bound for @xmath76 , which is more restrictive than ( [ sub ] ) and must be fulfilled by any quantum system .",
    "thus , we can define a more restrictive inequality than the ss , @xmath77 with @xmath78 where @xmath74 is given by the balance between eof and qd , eq . ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the ss , despite of being more difficult to prove , is essentially derived through extensions of its classical counterpart , but correlations play a different role in quantum systems .",
    "so , it is not surprising that a more restrictive bound may occur .    to exemplify this",
    "let us suppose we have a convex mixed state @xmath79 , where @xmath80 : @xmath81 + \\alpha|000\\rangle$ ] , with @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the identity operator over the joint hilbert space of @xmath84 .",
    "let us define two quantities @xmath85 and @xmath86 in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) we plot @xmath87 and @xmath88 as a function of @xmath89 , and , in the inset , we plot @xmath74 for a fixed @xmath90 .",
    "it is easy to see that in this situation @xmath74 can be positive or negative . when @xmath91 the inequality given by eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) is weaker than the ss given by eq .",
    "( [ sub ] ) .",
    "however , when @xmath75 , meaning that the eof of all bipartions is larger than their qd , eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) is stronger than eq .",
    "( [ sub ] ) , limiting the lower bound for @xmath76 .",
    "this is a strikingly different bound imposed on the entropies of quantum systems , which is not shared by their classical counterpart .",
    "the inequality above recovers the ss only when @xmath92 is null , meaning that the distribution of bipartite entanglement is equal to the amount of distributed quantum discord or smaller than that .",
    "it is important to emphasize here the essential role that ss plays in classical and quantum information theories @xcite .",
    "many fundamental inequalities , as nonnegativity of entropy and subadditivity , can be derived from that . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the only inequality known to be independent is the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is valid when the ss saturates on some particular subsystems configuration .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the inequality in ref .",
    "@xcite is independent of ( [ newstrsub ] ) as well , when @xmath75 , since in this case ss can not be saturated .",
    "however something else can be learned from this saturation . given a quadripartite quantum system @xmath93 such that ss is saturated for the three triples @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 then , @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "substituting @xmath98 by @xmath99 and using the monogamic relation , eq .",
    "( [ koashi ] ) , and the conservation law , eq .",
    "( [ unix ] ) , it is straightforward to show that when @xmath100 we have @xmath101 .",
    "so , as in eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) , the difference between the eof and the qd is of fundamental importance .    ) , @xmath87 , in red ( solid line ) and the difference between the right and left hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) , @xmath88 , in blue ( dotted line ) . combining these two quantities the stronger inequality eq .",
    "( [ newstrsub ] ) is obtained .",
    "the difference between its right and left hand sides is given by the shaded area .",
    "the inset shows @xmath102 . ]",
    "to summarize , we have given a monogamic relation between the eof and the qd .",
    "for that , we have derived a general interrelation on how those quantities are distributed in a general tripartite system .",
    "we applied this relation to show that in the dqc1 the entanglement present between one of the subsystems and the environment is responsible for the non - zero quantum discord . since the maximally mixed state is entangled with the environment , we show that the circuit described by the dqc1 distributes this initial entanglement between the pure qubit and the mixed state .",
    "our results suggest that the protocol ability to redistribute entanglement is a necessary condition for the speedup of the quantum computer .",
    "in addition , we have extended the discussion for an arbitrary tripartite mixed system showing the existence of an inequality for the subsystems entropies which is stronger than the usual ss .",
