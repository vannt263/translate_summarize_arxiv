    "in this paper we extract information about the baryon decuplet mass spectrum from an effective lagrangian with @xmath0 chiral symmetry .",
    "little experimental refinement of the decuplet masses has been performed in the past fifteen years , and decuplet mass differences , particularly isospin splittings , have large relative errors .",
    "the mass of one decuplet baryon , the @xmath1 , has not even been measured directly , because it can not be produced as a low - energy proton - pion resonance .",
    "therefore , relations among the decuplet baryons as derived from chiral symmetry and its known breakings ( through quark masses and charges ) , for the time being , have some predictive power : one may simply use chiral relations to rewrite the highly uncertain baryon masses in terms of their better - measured counterparts .",
    "once the decuplet masses have been measured with greater precision , we will be able to judge the accuracy of the relations .",
    "the amount by which those combinations of decuplet masses which are predicted to satisfy the relations fail to do so is a measure of the reliability of the chiral theory we are using and the size of the contributions of those higher - order chiral terms which do not satisfy the relations .",
    "we can also compute loop corrections in the chiral theory to an order consistent with the tree - level calculations and decide whether the breaking of the relations at tree level can be explained by lowest - order loop effects .",
    "thus the careful examination of these relations provides an important consistency check on the trustworthiness of chiral perturbation theory . in this paper",
    "we derive four such relations , study their group - theoretical nature , and find that the one - loop contributions are consistent with the sizes of the relation breakings , with remaining discrepancies easily explained by the presence of contributions at third order in quark masses and charges .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the motivation and construction of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory , which is the method we utilize to perform computations . in section 3 ,",
    "the decuplet lagrangian is constructed as an expansion to second order in flavor breaking .",
    "we examine the free parameters of the theory and point out group - theoretical redundancies , which allow us to count the number of expected mass relations in section 4 .",
    "the four relations which are found hold to second order in flavor breaking are exhibited in section 5 , along with group - theoretical reasons for their generality .",
    "we also present the general formula for decuplet masses in terms of group - theoretical chiral coefficients . in section 6 , we demonstrate that certain finite one - loop corrections to the relations are calculable , and show why some loop contributions nontrivially vanish . in section 7 , we present current numerical results for both the relation breakings and the full set of chiral coefficients , using various choices of measured masses , and find that we can explain the amount by which decuplet mass relations are broken by their lowest - order loop corrections , thus lending credence to heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 8 .",
    "an effective field theory which takes into account the approximate @xmath2 chiral symmetry of the three lightest quark flavors and its spontaneous symmetry breakdown to a more closely satisfied @xmath3 symmetry , namely strong isospin , has long been used to describe successfully the low - momentum physics of the goldstone bosons of this symmetry breaking , the octet of light pseudoscalar mesons@xcite .",
    "the keys to this approach are twofold : first , that the effective lagrangian , written using the meson octet fields as the fundamental degrees of freedom , and including the infinite set of all terms satisfying the same symmetries as the original lagrangian ( written in terms of the fundamental quark fields ) , is _ formally _ equivalent to the original lagrangian ; and second , that the terms in the effective lagrangian may be organized perturbatively in successively higher orders of the chiral symmetry - breaking parameters and the derivative operator ( divided by the dimensionally appropriate powers of the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath4 1 gev ) , which give calculated contributions to physical processes that decrease with the order of the terms . for this second requirement to be satisfied ,",
    "it is necessary both that the parameters which break chiral symmetry explicitly , namely current quark masses and their electric charges , give contributions sufficiently small ( which is guaranteed by @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , and that the meson momenta are small compared to @xmath7 .",
    "the latter condition in particular requires a small meson mass .",
    "because the masses of the ground - state baryons are already about 1 gev , the assumptions of chiral perturbativity are violated by a chiral lagrangian naively including baryons fields as degrees of freedom .",
    "however , an indication of how one may avoid this problem is suggested by heavy quark effective field theory@xcite . we will use the formalism employed by georgi@xcite",
    "one considers a chiral baryon multiplet to be a collection of heavy , nearly on - shell particles degenerate in mass @xmath8 and unit - norm four - velocity @xmath9 , and having momentum @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the residual , off - shell momentum of the baryon .",
    "the statement that the baryons are nearly on - shell is expressed by the constraint @xmath12 ; thus we have a momentum small enough that we may construct a perturbative chiral theory .",
    "this is implemented by the transformation on the baryon fields in any multiplet @xmath13 via @xmath14 the positive- and negative - energy solutions are separated by means of the projection operators @xmath15 and we work only with the positive solutions . whereas the original free fields @xmath13 satisfy the usual dirac equation @xmath16 , the new free fields @xmath17 satisfy a massless dirac equation .",
    "this means that a derivative acting upon @xmath17 will pull down a factor of @xmath18 rather than @xmath19 , producing the perturbative expansion we require .",
    "henceforth we will work only in perturbations about these effectively massless fields , and drop the subscript @xmath20 .",
    "this method , called heavy baryon effective field theory ( hbeft ) , has been developed as a useful calculational tool by jenkins and manohar@xcite , although the general method could be applied to effective field theories with other heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "however , it must be stressed that we have lost some information in hbeft , namely the baryon multiplet mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is nowhere present , so the lagrangian will be sensitive only to baryon mass _",
    "differences_.    that baryon multiplets are assumed to be degenerate in lowest - order mass and four - velocity makes it convenient to write a lagrangian expression @xmath21 in the baryon fields for each velocity @xmath20 . as with the fields",
    ", we will henceforth suppress the index @xmath20 on @xmath21 .",
    "the use of this description has the effect of greatly simplifying the dirac algebra ; in particular , particles and antiparticles no longer mix , reducing four - spinors to two - spinors .",
    "it is easily seen@xcite that any gamma matrix structure in baryon bilinears can be replaced with the @xmath22-number velocity @xmath9 and a generalized spin operator @xmath23 defined by the properties @xmath24_{+ } = \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( v^{\\mu } v^{\\nu } - g^{\\mu \\nu } \\right ) , \\hspace{2em } \\left [ s^{\\mu } , s^{\\nu } \\right]_{- } = i \\epsilon^{\\mu \\nu \\rho \\sigma } v_{\\rho } s_{\\sigma } , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "a specific representation of the operator satisfying these relations is @xmath26 in the rest frame ( @xmath27 ) , the operator @xmath23 is found to reduce to the usual pauli matrices @xmath28 with the usual commutation relations .",
    "the prescriptions listed above are useful for any baryon multiplet included in our theory ; in the current model we must consider both baryon decuplet and octet degrees of freedom . whereas the octet baryon fields are taken to be ordinary dirac fields ,",
    "the decuplet is taken to be represented by rarita - schwinger fields @xmath29 , symmetric under permutations of the @xmath30 flavor indices @xmath31 , with the spin-1/2 portion projected out via the usual constraint @xmath32 . in hbeft",
    ", this translates to the two conditions @xmath33 the consequences of these conditions for the feynman rules of this theory are summarized in reference  @xcite .    one point ,",
    "however , that should be made at this time is that the octet and decuplet in this theory are taken to have different multiplet common masses , @xmath34 .",
    "both fields , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , transform under the rule given by eq .  [ rot ] ; since the values of @xmath8 in the phases are different , the intermultiplet spacing @xmath37 is a parameter which appears in the lagrangian and must be placed into the theory by hand .",
    "the hadron field multiplets may be compactly represented by matrices in flavor space . the baryon and meson octets have the familiar forms @xmath38 and @xmath39 the baryon decuplet in this notation , a @xmath40 array , may be represented as ( suppressing lorentz indices ) a collection of three matrices : @xmath41 one may assign any particular permutation of indices _ i , j , k _ to denote row , column , and sub - matrix in this representation , because the decuplet is completely symmetric under rearrangement of flavor indices .",
    "we require in particular that the baryon chiral lagrangian contains the usual nonlinear sigma model . to this end",
    ", we define the fields @xmath42 where the choice of pion decay constant normalization is @xmath43 mev",
    ". then , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 specifying the left- and right - handed chiral transformations respectively , the field @xmath46 is chosen to transform under @xmath0 according to the rule @xmath47 a mapping which implicitly defines the transformation @xmath48 , and which implies the usual transformation @xmath49 under our transformation choice of @xmath46 , we may define hermitean vector and axial vector currents : @xmath50 so that these currents may couple to the baryon fields in a chirally - invariant way , we need the baryonic transformation properties @xmath51 and the chirally - covariant derivatives @xmath52_{- } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\left ( { \\cal d}^{\\nu } t^{\\mu}\\right)_{ijk } & \\equiv & \\partial^{\\nu } t^{\\mu}_{ijk } - i ( v^{\\nu})_i{}^l t^{\\mu}_{ljk } - i ( v^{\\nu})_j{}^l t^{\\mu}_{ilk } - i   ( v^{\\nu})_k{}^l t^{\\mu}_{ijl } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which have the same transformation properties ( eq .  [ xform ] ) as the baryon fields upon which they act .",
    "the explicitly chiral symmetry - breaking operators , namely @xmath53 are included by the usual spurion procedure , treating them as fields which transform under @xmath0 as the conjugate representations of the amount by which they break the chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the relevant pieces of the qcd lagrangian in a chiral basis are @xmath54 where @xmath55 from this we obtain the usual rules @xmath56 one can quickly see in the theory with the field @xmath46 that the matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 will always occur in the combinations @xmath59 which are designed to be hermitean , have definite parity properties as indicated by the subscript , and transform appropriately under @xmath0 : @xmath60      now it is a simple matter to construct the most general lagrangian .",
    "this model is constructed to include all terms to two orders in the perturbation operators we have discussed , namely all terms with a total of two of the following operators : @xmath61 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "because the derivative operators ultimately generate meson masses and hence quark masses , the series may be thought of as one in quark masses and charges alone .",
    "the physics of the expansion becomes more lucid when we distinguish our results by the number of powers of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , namely , organizing them according to their @xmath30 and isospin-@xmath65 properties .",
    "since we are representing strong and electromagnetic interactions only , we include only those terms that respect the same symmetries .",
    "charge conjugation symmetry eliminates all terms with an odd total number of @xmath66 , whereas parity conservation requires that @xmath67 and @xmath68 only occur in an even total number ( before we include derivative terms ) , that is , not before second order .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath67 and @xmath68 , when expanded in powers of the meson fields , give no contribution before @xmath69 , these terms would not appear in mass relations until we included loops of _ second_-order terms .",
    "thus the parity - odd combinations do not occur at this order , and we may therefore suppress the subscript ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "next , all terms with derivatives produce factors of meson momentum and thus contribute to masses only through diagrams with meson loops . because higher - order loops require more meson fields and hence produce more powers of the quark masses , we compute only those loop diagrams with one meson loop .",
    "derivatives appear in the lagrangian through the covariant derivative @xmath71 and through the axial vector current @xmath72 .",
    "meson fields also occur in @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we quickly learn that all one - meson loop diagrams at one derivative will either be of the `` keyhole '' variety ( figure 1a ) or have two separated insertions of @xmath75 ( figure 1b ) .",
    "there is a bewildering proliferation of terms at second order once we include derivative terms , for example , @xmath76 and many others .",
    "two constraints , however , simplify the situation : the first is that we are only computing diagrams with one meson loop ; and the second is that terms with one covariant derivative @xmath77 and some other operator @xmath78 can be transformed away by a suitable redefinition of the baryon field and the addition of new @xmath79 terms .",
    "the physical reasoning behind this transformation is that the only one - derivative terms we allow in the fermion lagrangian are the kinetic terms ; if we find other one - derivative terms , it means that we will have non - canonical equations of motion for the baryons and unfamiliar forms for the feynman propagators . under these rules , the only remaining terms at second order and including meson fields are of the forms @xmath80 with appropriate factors of @xmath20 and @xmath81 thrown in to give the terms the correct lorentz structure .",
    "clearly , the only one - loop graphs possible from these terms are keyhole diagrams ; this will prove to have special significance when we consider loop corrections to certain mass combinations .    the light - flavor symmetry @xmath82 , which includes strong isospin , is broken in this model only by the inequality of quark masses and charges ; all other operators and coefficients are assumed to obey chiral symmetry . under these restrictions , the most general decuplet lagrangian we need to consider in this model is @xmath83 the sign of the kinetic term follows from the fact that the rarita - schwinger spinor solutions are spacelike .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are normalized to be unitless and expected to be of order one ( as demanded by naturalness ) .",
    "the factor @xmath89 multiplying the electromagnetic terms follows from the fact that these terms , if computed from the quark lagrangian , would arise from photon loop diagrams .",
    "a naive counting of the parameters in the lagrangian , eq .",
    "[ lag ] , gives us one decuplet - octet mass breaking @xmath90 , two first - order coefficients in @xmath91 ( @xmath84 and @xmath22 ) , four at second order in each of @xmath92 ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) and @xmath93 ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , and the three light quark masses @xmath94 .",
    "the coefficients of the derivative terms can be measured , at least in principle , in decuplet decay processes .",
    "this gives a total of fourteen fit parameters , and the situation appears to be hopeless .",
    "however , not all of the coefficients and quark masses in the lagrangian are independent parameters . many can be eliminated by a careful examination of the group - theoretical properties of the various terms .",
    "we first consider those terms which appear as singlets in the lagrangian . in a more usual rarita - schwinger theory , the mass term is just @xmath95 this term does not occur in hbeft , for we have eliminated the common mass term through field redefinition .",
    "if a term which is of the same form appears at higher order in perturbation theory , that is , an operator singlet multiplying the fully contracted @xmath96 fields , it too will contribute only to the overall multiplet mass , and thus may have been defined away at the outset . the terms in this category are those with coefficients @xmath90 , @xmath85 , and @xmath87 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath90 can be neglected only as long as there is only one multiplet mass in the theory .",
    "the next observation applies equally to any chiral perturbation theory which takes any set of parameters as undetermined inputs ; we will consider the particular case of the current quark masses .",
    "each term in the chiral lagrangian then contains a certain number of factors of the quark mass matrix @xmath57 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath97 of the various terms are _ a priori _ unrelated parameters ( unlike in a renormalized field theory ) . given a particular term with @xmath98 powers of @xmath57 , one readily sees that the term is invariant under the transformation @xmath99 where @xmath18 is arbitrary .",
    "thus , in any chiral theory , one can not hope to obtain quark masses , but only ratios of quark masses .",
    "for three light flavors , we have two ratios ; we will find it convenient to use two particular such ratios , @xmath100 note that both parameters are small , inasmuch as @xmath101 , and that @xmath102 can appear with isospin - conserving operators , whereas @xmath103 can only appear with isospin - breaking operators .",
    "we can follow this argument one step farther in hbeft .",
    "we simply observe that the tree - level lagrangian is insensitive to transformations of the type @xmath104 , where * 1 * is the identity matrix and @xmath22 is arbitrary .",
    "this follows because each insertion of * 1 * in a term of @xmath105 is equivalent to a redefinition of the coefficient of the terms of lower orders in @xmath57 by simple binomial expansion .",
    "eventually , we generate singlet terms in this way , which we may ignore , using the argument described above . in particular , this tells us that the lagrangian is sensitive only to differences of quark masses ; or , combining this with the previous result , it is sensitive only to _ ratios of differences _ of quark masses . for three light flavors , only one parameter remains , which we choose to be the parameter @xmath103 .    because the relevant operator is not merely the number matrix @xmath57 , but the full operator @xmath106 , the coefficients no longer shift simply by @xmath22-numbers .",
    "the above argument then fails to hold , and we must use both quark mass parameters , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "however , this situation is true only for those terms for which we must include the meson fields in loops . in our expansion",
    ", this means the first - order terms in @xmath91 .",
    "the tree - level masses can always be written using only @xmath103 . because , as described in the appendix , a diagram of the form of figure 1a may be written in terms of the internal baryon mass , the only diagrams in this model in which @xmath102 would appear are the keyhole diagrams of the operator @xmath91 ; however , as we will see in section 6 , such contributions cancel in the relations we derive .",
    "there is still one more major simplification of the lagrangian .",
    "consider any @xmath107 matrix @xmath78 as an operator in the mass contribution @xmath108 because @xmath109 is symmetric in its flavor indices , the placement of the contraction is irrelevant .",
    "group - theoretically , @xmath78 has a singlet part , which we may ignore , and an octet part .",
    "the raising and lowering operators included in @xmath78 , which have the off - diagonal matrix entries as coefficients , do not contribute to mass terms , which are diagonal .",
    "this leaves only operators proportional to the cartan subalgebra of isospin and hypercharge .",
    "no matter how many operators we have of the form of @xmath78 , they can always be redefined into only two : one proportional to @xmath110 and one proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "these operators will obey equal - spacing rules in isospin and hypercharge .",
    "we have three such operators in our model : those with coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113",
    ". a more careful analysis of the group theory of decuplet masses will appear in the next section .",
    "we are again ready to count parameters .",
    "there are the two operators proportional to isospin and hypercharge ; one quark mass parameter @xmath103 , and one remaining @xmath92 and one @xmath93 term , making five unknowns . on the other side of the equation , we begin with ten decuplet masses , but again , hbeft tells us that we can discover nothing of the common decuplet mass .",
    "we thus have nine mass differences , implying that there are four nontrivial mass relations between the decuplet baryons .",
    "using the redefinition properties of the last section , we find that there are exactly four mass relations between the decuplet masses that hold to second - order in flavor - breaking in the tree - level lagrangian . in a symmetric form",

    "we label the amounts by which these relations are experimentally broken as @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "these relations are not unknown in the literature . in fact , the first three can be trivially derived from quark model calculations over a quarter of a century old@xcite .",
    "the original form of the relations connects the masses of the octet to decuplet baryons , for when these were first derived , the octet masses were much better known than the decuplet masses .",
    "this does not occur in the form of hbeft that we use , as the octet and decuplet are treated as two independent multiplets , unrelated by the physical fact that they are both three - quark states , and the multiplet mass splitting @xmath90 is an independent parameter .",

    "it was pointed out by okubo@xcite as early as 1963 that , to second order in flavor breaking , the only surviving such relation is @xmath117 which is , neglecting isospin states , the same as eq .",
    "it was also derived in this form by jenkins@xcite , using hbeft .",
    "equivalent forms of all four relations have been derived in a very general quark model , the general parametrization method of morpurgo@xcite .",
    "again , the relations were written in terms of equations connecting octet to decuplet masses .",
    "let us examine the reasons that eqs .",
    "[ first][last ] hold .",
    "[ first ] is simply a consequence of the wigner ",
    "eckart theorem applied to an isospin-3/2 multiplet for which all lagrangian mass terms transform as @xmath118 , which is the case for our model lagrangian , eq .",
    "[ lag ] .",
    "one can find by direct substitution that , if we replace the matrices @xmath119 and @xmath120 with an _ arbitrary _",
    "@xmath121 matrix @xmath78 , the relations are still true .",
    "this is as much as saying that the relations hold for each lagrangian term first- or second - order in any flavor singlet or octet operator .",
    "consider the @xmath30 structure of the operator @xmath122 in an arbitrary decuplet mass term : @xmath123 since @xmath124 and all of these representations are real , the operator @xmath125 must live in some combination of the representations in the direct sum above .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath126 and so the product of two @xmath121 matrices can produce decuplet mass terms that transform as @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 . that we obtain the result for arbitrary",
    "@xmath130 means that the relations hold for arbitrary @xmath127 s and @xmath128 s ; but the @xmath129 was constructed only from two identical matrices @xmath78 , and thus is not an arbitrary @xmath129 .    however , we may construct the most general operator containing a @xmath129 , @xmath131 , and by direct computation show that in a decuplet mass term it nevertheless respects eqs .  [ first][last ] .",
    "this will be extremely useful when we consider loop corrections to the relations , because certain loop corrections are of this form and thus do not contribute to mass relation breaking .",
    "we conclude that only operators transforming under a * 64 * will break the relations",
    ".    we may also catalogue the _ complete _ @xmath30 group - theoretical structure of the decuplet mass terms independent of their physical origins in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the physical decuplet masses alone determine the numerical size of these coefficients , and thus limit the size of contributions from terms in the lagrangian not appearing in this model . denoting the chiral coefficient of the term with operators transforming under an @xmath45-dimensional representation of @xmath30 and a @xmath132-dimensional representation of isospin by @xmath133 , a straightforward exercise in @xmath30 clebsch - gordan coefficients",

    "( note that the coefficients are independent of the isospin casimir @xmath137 for the decuplet because all states are singly degenerate , so that @xmath138 and @xmath135 uniquely determine the state . ) in this notation we find the relation - breaking parameters to be given by @xmath139    an amusing implication of the insensitivity of eqs .",
    "[ first][last ] to the form of the chiral breaking , combined with the symmetry of the decuplet field under permutation of flavor indices , is that the four relations are invariant under permutations of the three isospin axes @xmath140 in the weight diagram of the decuplet in flavor space ; for example , eq .  [ first ] becomes @xmath141 under @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , or @xmath145 under @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "that is , the relations are unaffected if we permute , for example , the up and strange quarks in all decuplet wavefunctions .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the tree - level decuplet mass relations holding at second order in flavor breaking are not exact , being broken only by those decuplet mass operators having some portion which transforms under a @xmath149 representation of @xmath30 .",
    "relations which hold to second - order in quark masses are particularly interesting , because any loop corrections which have the form @xmath150 are absorbed through the usual renormalization procedure by the appropriate counterterms , and therefore must also satisfy the relations . as a consequence ,",
    "the loop corrections below @xmath151 are calculable and nonanalytic in quark masses , and independent of the arbitrary renormalization point @xmath152 . in one - loop corrections of the terms with less than two powers of @xmath91 , all corrections are of this form .",
    "thus , in this model , one - loop diagrams give calculable corrections to the relations eqs .",
    "[ first][last ] if and only if they contain a piece transforming under a @xmath153 .",
    "an analogous situation occurs for the octet baryons , as the hbeft lagrangian is found to satisfy one relation at second order@xcite , the coleman ",
    "glashow relation . here",
    "we wish to consider the various meson loop corrections to decuplet masses and classify them by their transformation properties .",
    "the one - loop diagrams fall into two basic categories : those with one quartic vertex ( figure 1a ) , which we have called keyhole diagrams , and those with two trilinear vertices ( figure 1b ) . keyhole diagrams in this model",
    "occur in two forms : those from the meson - field expansion of the operator @xmath91 ( which transforms as singlet plus octet , and therefore satisfies the relations ) , and those with the structure @xmath154 where flavor indices can appear in all possible contractions , @xmath155 is the meson octet index , and @xmath156 is that function which appears upon integration over meson momentum . that the two meson field indices are the same simply implies that the meson loop must close ; @xmath157-@xmath158 mixing does not change this result , because we may rediagonalize the meson @xmath30 generators so that they refer now to mass eigenstates .",
    "all that is important is that both the unrotated and rotated generators are octet .",
    "note also that this result holds for _ each _ value of @xmath155 , not just the sum . because the largest representation obtained from the two octet fields is a @xmath159 , such loop expressions satisfy eqs .",
    "[ first][last ] ; thus all keyhole diagrams satisfy the second - order relations .",
    "next consider loop diagrams with two trilinear vertices . in this model",
    ", the intermediate state may be either decuplet or octet , the latter made possible through the inclusion of the interaction @xmath160 for the first time we need to consider the inclusion of the octet baryons in the decuplet lagrangian .",
    "that octet and decuplet baryons should be considered together is a physical statement of the fact that chiral lagrangians distinguish neither multiplet as being the more fundamental , because both arise from the @xmath30 product @xmath161 , and it is only the choice of the sign of @xmath90 that determines which multiplet is heavier .",
    "first , however , consider the case of the diagram with an intermediate decuplet baryon .",
    "the general structure of the diagram in this case is @xmath162 where @xmath163 refers to the ten possible intermediate decuplet states , and @xmath122 is an operator that may appear on the intermediate line ( for example , the @xmath164 tree - level term ) . now",
    "if @xmath122 is arbitrary , there is little that can be said using only group theory .",
    "however , if we consider only those diagrams for which @xmath165 , then we see that the @xmath163-dependence is trivial , for then we have a completeness relation over decuplet generators : @xmath166 we find that these diagrams have exactly the same group - theoretic structure as in eq .",
    "[ key ] and therefore also satisfy the relations eqs .",
    "[ first][last ] .",
    "since each loop contributes a factor of @xmath167 , dimensional analysis shows these loops to have quark mass dependence @xmath168 .",
    "the diagrams with internal octet baryons have an analogous property : if the octet baryons are taken degenerate in mass ( but the decuplet masses are unconstrained ) , we again have a completeness sum ( this time over octet generators ) , and conclude that diagrams with @xmath165 satisfy the decuplet relations",
    ". however , there is a complication in the presence of the intermultiplet spacing @xmath90 : neglecting the mass splittings within the baryon octet seems unreasonable when many of these splittings are comparable in size to @xmath90 .",
    "the most pedantic way of including this information would be to solve simultaneously for the octet chiral coefficients using the experimental octet mass values , and to include the corresponding operators @xmath122 in the loop diagrams .",
    "however , it is more direct to use the octet masses directly ; the expressions and their contributions to the breaking of eqs .",
    "[ first][last ] are exhibited in the appendix .",
    "the remaining decuplet - intermediate diagrams ( those with @xmath169 ) may also be rewritten in terms of the decuplet baryon masses , rather than the chiral coefficients ; because the loop coefficients are proportional to powers of quark masses and charges , the difference between using chiral coefficients and decuplet masses within loops is higher order still ( at least @xmath170 ) in quark masses and charges .",
    "it is thus not unreasonable to present the mass expressions in this manner .",
    "these finite corrections to eqs .",
    "[ first][last ] are also discussed in the appendix .",
    "we are now ready to test the validity of the relations eqs .",
    "[ first][last ] using the expressions listed in the appendix .",
    "because , as mentioned in the introduction , the mass of the @xmath171 has never been directly measured , we can either treat the relations as predictions of its mass , or we can eliminate it from three of the relations using the fourth ; since all four of the relations result from chiral perturbation theory alone , any linear combination of them is also a valid relation . we choose to eliminate the @xmath171 using eq .  [ first ] ( and its loop corrections ) , because it is isospin - breaking and is the only one involving @xmath172 masses alone . because the other three relations depend only on measured quantities , we obtain three nontrivial tests of hbeft .",
    "one problem that immediately crops up is that the @xmath172 masses , as presented in the particle data group s ( pdg ) _ review of particle properties _",
    "@xcite , rely on data fifteen years old , which generally have substantial uncertainties relative to the isospin breaking of the multiplet .",
    "the statistical averages of the accepted independent measurements in the pdg are @xmath173 we may ask about the reliability of these data . a recent discussion of the status of baryon isospin splitting measurements is found in a paper by cutkosky@xcite ; in particular , the author points out that , in a quark model fit , it is very difficult to accommodate the pdg values for the @xmath172-mass splittings .",
    "one explanation is , of course , that the quark model is inadequate ; the other is that the measurements need to be refined .",
    "the virginia polytechnic institute ( vpi ) group@xcite currently recommends the value @xmath174 the uncertainty depends on the measurement of scattering lengths and the pion - nucleon coupling constant , and is expected to fall as their fit is refined .",
    "even so , this value with its current uncertainty is in disagreement with eq .",
    ".    it would also be very helpful to bring down the large error in the pdg @xmath175 mass measurement .",
    "there are a few pieces of information , experimental and theoretical , in disagreement with the value in eq .",
    "this particular number is based on one measurement@xcite , and is in discrepancy with three other independently measured pdg values , which have the statistical average @xmath176 these were not used in the pdg fit because uncertainties of the individual measurements were not estimated ; the uncertainty given here is the statistical variance , not experimental uncertainty .",
    "however , we may use this information as an alternative to the pdg value to demonstrate dependence of the results on the measurement of @xmath172 masses . to support this choice ,",
    "there are additional predictions of a smaller @xmath175 mass : morpurgo@xcite , using his general parametrization method , predicts @xmath177 where we have used the pdg number for the @xmath178 mass .",
    "furthermore , pion - deuterium scattering data taken by pedroni _",
    "et al._@xcite produce the mass combination measurement @xmath179 however , the error is statistical only and does not reflect a number of theoretical corrections made in the processing of the data . if we combine this number with the relation eq .",

    "nevertheless , these numbers all appear to be roughly consistent and quite different from the pdg value .    in summary ,",
    "to demonstrate the dependence of results on @xmath172 masses , we will exhibit our results twice : once using only pdg numbers ( data set a ) , and once using the pdg number for @xmath178 in eq .",
