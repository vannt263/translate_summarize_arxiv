    "pattern formation is ubiquitous in spatiotemporal dynamical systems in nature  @xcite ranging from granular materials  @xcite to ecosystems  @xcite and plants  @xcite .",
    "complex dynamical networks , such as networks of coupled oscillators , are naturally spatiotemporal systems .",
    "the past two decades have witnessed a rapid growth of research on various types of dynamical processes in complex networks  @xcite , which include synchronization  @xcite , virus spreading  @xcite , traffic flow  @xcite , and cascading failures  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "a primary issue was to address the interplay between the dynamical processes and the network structure .",
    "an interesting problem thus concerns pattern formation in complex networks , where a basic question is how the network structure affects the dynamical patterns . to our knowledge , in spite of the vast literature on dynamics in complex networks ,",
    "a systematic study of the interplay between pattern formation and network structure is lacking .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap by presenting results on pattern emergence , evolution , and transitions on networks undergoing systematic random structural perturbations .    to probe into the interplay between network structure and dynamical patterns in a concrete manner , we focus on coupled oscillator networks .",
    "an interesting phenomenon in such dynamical networks is that , under certain conditions , the oscillators can be self - organized to form spatial patterns  @xcite .",
    "as the formation of the patterns relies heavily on the symmetry of the coupling structure of the network , an intuitive thinking would suggest that it is unlikely for complex networks to generate dynamical patterns  @xcite . yet , in natural and man - made systems , there are situations where well - organized patterns can form on complex networks , such as the firing patterns in the human brain  @xcite .",
    "a paradox was then how spatially ordered patterns can emerge from random or disordered coupling structures associated with a complex network .",
    "there have been previous efforts devoted to resolving this paradox .",
    "for example , pattern formation in complex network of coupled activators and inhibitors was studied , where turing - like patterns were observed  @xcite .",
    "complex networks of coupled excitable nodes were also studied  @xcite with respect to pattern formation in which the technique of dominant phase advanced driving was introduced , leading to the discovery of target - like wave patterns .",
    "desynchronization patterns in complex network of coupled chaotic oscillators were subsequently studied  @xcite , where it was found that reordering network nodes according to the eigenvector of the unstable mode can be effective at identifying the stable synchronous pattern from an asynchronous state .",
    "recently , computational graph algorithms were introduced into the field of network synchronization to study synchronous patterns in large - size complex networks  @xcite , where the important role of network symmetry in pattern formation was elucidated . in spite of the existing works , many questions concerning pattern formation and transition in complex networks",
    "remain , especially with respect to relatively more sophisticated patterns with complex spatial structures such as spiral waves  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our study is then spiral waves in coupled oscillator networks , which are patterns observed ubiquitously in physical , chemical and biological systems  @xcite .",
    "different from other types of patterns such as turing patterns , the stability of a spiral wave depends crucially on the motion of the spiral tip  @xcite , leading to the specially designed methods for analyzing and controlling spiral waves  @xcite . in most previous works ,",
    "spiral waves are studied for networks with a regular spatial structure , such as a periodic lattice .",
    "nevertheless , there were works on spiral waves in systems with an irregular spatial structure  @xcite .",
    "for example , the formation of spiral waves in a medium possessing random ( small - world ) connections was studied  @xcite with the finding that , while the structural irregularity is detrimental to forming and sustaining a spiral wave , a small number of random links can counterintuitively enhance the wave stability .",
    "another work  @xcite revealed that , random connections added locally to a regular medium can cause the meandering motion of the spiral tip to approach a fixed point .",
    "it was later found  @xcite that random connections introduced globally into a regular medium can lead to rich behaviors in the transition of the system dynamics among global synchronization state , steady state , and multiple spirals .",
    "these previous works indicated that the network structure can have a significant effect on pattern formation and transition , calling a systematic study of this issue .    to facilitate computation , we use coupled map lattices ( cml )  @xcite to investigate the dynamical responses of spiral waves to structural perturbations .",
    "historically , cmls were used to understand patterns including spiral waves in complex media such as granular materials  @xcite . in our work , staring from a two - dimensional regular lattice capable of generating stable spiral waves , we systematically introduce random links into the network and study the transitions in the pattern dynamics as the network structure becomes increasingly random ( complex ) .",
    "we uncover dynamical patterns and richer bifurcations that were not seen in previous works  @xcite , such as chimera - like states where two synchronization clusters coexist with many asynchronous oscillators and the pinned multi - armed spirals in which the arms of the spiral are pinned to a square - shape boundary .",
    "an intriguing finding is that , in the region where pattern transitions occur , the dynamics is extremely sensitive to small changes in the network structure .",
    "these findings shed new lights on pattern behaviors in complex networks , which may lead to effective methods of pattern control .    in sec .",

    "a key difference from previous studies is that in our system the motion of the spiral tip is random in a limited area ( the central area ) , which leads to the sensitivity of the system pattern in the transition regions .",

    "in particular , a previous result in the study of synchronization transitions in complex networks was that , as the network becomes increasingly complex , an order parameter characterizing the degree of network synchronization can increase continuously  @xcite . as demonstrated in this work , for spiral wave patterns a properly defined order parameter would exhibit a non - monotonous behavior because , as the number of random links is increased , the state of the network can become perfectly ordered ( global synchronization ) and then become less ordered with a chimera - like state and a pinned multi - armed spiral",
    ". this peculiar phenomenon may be specific to spiral - wave patterns where we supply random links only to the tip region .",
    "indeed , when random links are added to the network on a global scale ( as with the newman - watts small - world network model  @xcite ) , we find a monotonic change in the degree of the order of the system state .",

    "<S> dynamical patterns in complex networks of coupled oscillators are both of theoretical and practical interest , yet to fully reveal and understand the interplay between pattern emergence and network structure remains to be an outstanding problem . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental issue is the effect of network structure on the stability of the patterns . </S>",
    "<S> we address this issue by using the setting where random links are systematically added to a regular lattice and focusing on the dynamical evolution of spiral wave patterns . as the network structure deviates more from the regular topology ( so that it becomes increasingly more complex ) </S>",
    "<S> , the original stable spiral wave pattern can disappear and a different type of pattern can emerge . </S>",
    "<S> our main findings are the following . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) short - distance links added to a small region containing the spiral tip can have a more significant effect on the wave pattern than long - distance connections . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) as more random links are introduced into the network , distinct pattern transitions can occur , which include the transition of spiral wave to global synchronization , to a chimera - like state , and then to a pinned spiral wave . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) around the transitions the network dynamics is highly sensitive to small variations in the network structure in the sense that the addition of even a single link can change the pattern from one type to another . </S>",
    "<S> these findings provide insights into the pattern dynamics in complex networks , a problem that is relevant to many physical , chemical , and biological systems . </S>"
