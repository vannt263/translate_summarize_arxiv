    "this can be seen from the fact that keeping the dissipation term in the inclusion without the corresponding fluctuation source , violates fdt , and makes it essentially a two - temperature problem , with inclusion temperature set to zero . to analyze the dynamics when fluctuations are thermal , i.e. , when both the inclusion and the surrounding fluid are at equal temperature @xmath154 , we set @xmath155 , and inclusion stress is given by , ^i= b u + _ i u + , [ eq : thermalinclusion ] where @xmath47 is unit variance gaussian white noise .",

    "when the amplitude of fluctuation @xmath158 is weak compared to the elastic stress ( large @xmath124 ) , the fluctuation contribution to the force on the walls converges to zero  this corresponds to the rigid inclusion result . for large fluctuations , the sign of the force depends on @xmath172 , the ratio of size of confinement to size of inclusion . for comparable size ( black curve )",

    "for all these cases we can analytically obtain the steady state probability distribution .    in the simplest description of the inclusion as a rigid object , we obtain analytical expression for the steady state distribution , which reveal the existence of a fluctuation - induced effective potential .",
    "this attractive force , which originates from the non - equilibrium nature the noise , is reminiscent of casimir forces in non - equilibrium systems @xcite .    considering the inclusion as an elastic element introduces an additional degree of freedom along with centre of mass , namely the extension or the inclusion length .",
    "the effective attraction between the inclusion and the confining walls persists , with the noise induced force dependent on the length of the inclusion .",
    "we find that the average length of the elastic inclusion depends non - trivially on the size of confinement and strength of the fluctuation .",
    "unlike the rigid and elastic description , a kelvin - voigt viscoelastic description of the inclusion , in general can not be mapped to an equilibrium system with an effective potentials . nevertheless , it is possible to have an effective equilibrium description in the absence of external confining forces .",
    "we find that the viscosity of the inclusion is a crucial parameter , the mean and variances of the inclusion length strongly depend on the viscosity ratio of the inclusion and the outside fluid , along with its stiffness and stress fluctuation .",
    "since the observed phenomena are due to the multiplicative and active nature of the noise , we believe these noise induced interactions should occur in a variety of biological and in - vitro contexts .",

    "our study of the active casimir - like forces at the cell boundary , arising from nuclear stiffness and fluctuations might be relevant to rigidity sensing by focal adhesions @xcite .",
    "we are currently extending our study to the case when the ( nuclear ) inclusion is subject to its own source of active fluctuation , in addition to the noise coming from the surrounding active fluid .",

    "hence , overdamped langevin equations with multiplicative delta - function noise , must be provided with an interpretation of the noise , in order to be meaningful .",
    "an unambiguous approach is to start with the correct microscopic inertial dynamics for all the microscopic variables , and establish a separation of time scales .",

    "however , as discussed in @xcite , one might choose to take these limits in different order , which result in different interpretations of the overdamped equations . since langevin dynamics corresponding to thermal noise is constrained to obey the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) , it is convenient to treat the thermal and active noise cases separately .      a necessary condition for the langevin dynamics eq .",
