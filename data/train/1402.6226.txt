    "_ shot noise _  @xcite characterises transport properties of mesoscopic conductors",
    ". therefore , studying properties of the shot noise is essential for understanding the behaviour of the mesoscopic carries .",
    "the properties can be described by the full counting statistics approach @xcite which considers _ the third and higher order _ cumulants , also known as irreducible correlators . at the same time",
    "first and second cumulants specify properties of equilibrium _ symmetrical _ johnson - nyquist noise which is different from the shot noise .",
    "typically  @xcite , the statistics of the shot noise are characterised by a non - symmetrical distribution , e.g. binomial or poisson .",
    "a scheme for a qualitative characterisation of the distribution asymmetry _ via _ measurements of the escape rate of an auxiliary multistable system driven by fluctuations has been recently suggested  @xcite . the main idea was to study the escape rate of a _ noise detector _ for characterisation of acting fluctuations which are the output of a mesoscopic system .",
    "this scheme was extensively discussed in a number of theoretical papers  @xcite and implemented experimentally with the josephson junction as a noise detector driven by poisson noise  @xcite . a combination of theoretical , numerical and experimental investigations was presented  @xcite showing some correspondences and disagreements between the theory , numerics and experiment .",
    "however , despite the progress made in the theoretical description of the shot - noise and , in turn , properties of the noise - detector scheme , certain questions still remain .",
    "for example , accuracy of the suggested theoretical approaches were not validated by numerical simulations .",
    "there are also certain disagreements between several published theoretical approaches  @xcite thus resulting in controversy  @xcite .",
    "notably , the reports indicate poor correspondence between the theoretical and experimental results  @xcite and several outstanding issues have been identified  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the literature cited two important aspects : ( i ) validity of the use of a third order cumulant approximation in theoretical approaches and ( ii ) omission of the prefactor in the expression of the escape rate  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , reported research  @xcite which places the scheme into a strong _ nonlinear _",
    "regime for maximising distribution asymmetry .    in the majority of published articles a similar theoretical model of the noise detector scheme has been used that corresponds to a non - linear oscillator driven by a mixture of white gaussian and poisson noises .",
    "the presence of the poissonian process leads to asymmetry of the noise distribution .",
    "the characterisation of the degree of this asymmetry has become the focus of such theoretical considerations . to make the model analytically tractable",
    ", an approximation of _ the third order cumulant _ is often applied together with a high barrier assumption  @xcite . if the latter corresponds to a typical experimental set  @xcite the former places limitations on the theoretical predictions , and the degree of the limitations is still not well understood .",
    "several theoretical approaches  @xcite assume a high friction limit resulting in over - damped model dynamics , whereas weak damping ( under - damped ) dynamics is experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "a revision of the existing approaches explained earlier is necessary in order to shed light on the non - gaussian noise induced escape problem .",
    "the aim of this research is therefore to present a generic approach beyond the third cumulant limit , and to compare the theoretical predictions with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the revision in the present work follows the approaches adopted in previous studies  @xcite demonstrating the presence of constraints on the noise characteristics when theoretical predictions are compared with numerical and/or experimental results .",
    "we also show that the absence of a prefactor in the estimation of the escape rate may result in a large error in theoretical predictions .",
    "theoretical considerations  @xcite , as well as the present work , are motivated by the use of the escape rate for characterisation of shot noise in mesoscopic conductors . however , the general theoretical setting is applicable for a wider range of problems including vibrations in civil structures @xcite , switching in mems and nems @xcite devices , neuronal dynamics @xcite and ion channel permittivity @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that noise - induced escape and the corresponding mean first - passage time problem in the presence of non - gaussian noise ( also known as white shot noise ) have not been discussed as comprehensively as white or coloured gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the literature is extensive and nearly all publications have dealt with one - dimensional potential systems  @xcite for the overdamped case . in some cases , additional limitations on noise characteristics @xcite allowed the problem to be solved analytically and made the task analytically intractable for other cases @xcite .",
    "the approach adapted in the present work is based on the practical realisations of a noise detector used for full counting statistics  @xcite .",
    "this approach provides an experimental basis for studying the escape problem in the presence of non - gaussian noise .",
    "the dynamic behaviour of the detector is under - damped and the acting noise is white ( uncorrelated ) with a finite second cumulant ; there are no explicit limitations on the shape of the noise distribution .",
    "this experimental setting is quite broad involving wide ranging research applications as mentioned above , and thus extends beyond the detection of noise statistics .",

    "a simplified experimental scheme , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) , shows a noise source and a threshold detector , both biased by current and based on the josephson junction  @xcite . for this system ,",
    "the voltage drop in the noise source is larger than thermal fluctuations .",
    "tunnelling events are a dominant source of carriers implying that the noise source is in a pure _ shot noise _ regime . an additional current bias ( middle of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) is used to remove a constant component @xmath0 of the shot noise @xmath10 indicating that _ zero - mean _ shot noise @xmath11 is acting on the detector .",
    "in contrast , the detector is in the thermal regime as the voltage drop of the detector is smaller than thermal fluctuations .",
    "it is noted that the experiments  @xcite are carried out in a low temperature environment with a minimal temperature of around 20 mk . for",
    "such low temperature values the quantum effects in the detector should be strong as predicted by the theory ( for example reference  @xcite ) . however , previous experimental results  @xcite state that the dynamics of the detector can also be described within the classical limit .",
    "another potentially important factor refers to the presence of the feedback effect of the detector to the noise source  @xcite .",
    "this factor can be neglected in our consideration due to the feedback being considered small in the reported experiments  @xcite .",
    "the josephson junction as a noise source produces shot noise with poissonian statistics  @xcite .",
    "poisson noise is known as a rare event process with an asymmetric probability distribution  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the asymmetry means that depending on the sign of the currents @xmath0 ( left and middle current sources in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) the right and left tails of the noise probability distribution are of different widths ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "this asymmetry is reflected in the difference ( asymmetry ) of escape rates in the detector that has a multistable potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "thus , the difference between the escape rates characterises the asymmetry of the noise distribution and , consequently , the degree of non - gaussianity . in order to extract quantitative information on non - gaussianity from the experimental measurements , a theoretical description ( in the form of a mathematical expression in the simplest case ) is required that conjoins the escape rate with the asymmetry parameter(s ) .",
    "so far the third cumulant , as mentioned above , has been considered as the main asymmetry parameter , although all cumulants of higher than the second order contribute  @xcite .",
    "note that the values of the first and second cumulants as well as detector parameters can be defined by using well established measurement techniques  @xcite , and therefore these values are considered as known. the validity of the theoretical prediction is crucial for the entire experimental approach .",
    "the dynamic system under consideration , which describes the experimental setup @xcite , is as follows @xmath12 equation ( [ sin_sys ] ) is in a dimensionless form and all the parameters are normalised . an equivalent non - normalised equation with corresponding values of parameters can be found in published papers  @xcite .",
    "normalised coordinate @xmath13 corresponds to the current of the josephson junction with biased potential @xmath5 and damping coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "the bias @xmath1 is selected in such a way that a tilted multistable ( washboard ) potential is formed in the system , and a noise - induced escape from one of the stable states via the lowest potential barrier ( fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( c ) ) is analysed . in case of a tilted form",
    ", the system ( [ sin_sys ] ) , after escape , evolves along the potential ( so - called running mode ) and this motion can be easily detected in experiments  @xcite .",
    "noise @xmath15 corresponds to the thermal noise in the detector .",
    "it is gaussian white noise with unit variance and zero mean value : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; @xmath18 defines noise intensity .",
    "term @xmath11 in ( [ sin_sys ] ) describes a shot noise of the source and consists of two components ( [ cnoise ] ) : @xmath0 is bias current applied to the source and @xmath10 corresponds to the poisson white noise which can be represented as a sum of independent pulses @xcite @xmath19 in expression  ( [ shot_noise ] ) , @xmath20 are independent random amplitudes of pulses , function @xmath21 describes the pulse shape , @xmath22 are independent random times of pulse appearance .",
    "time intervals @xmath23 between two subsequent pulses has exponential distribution @xmath24 where @xmath4 is a parameter of the poisson noise and defines the frequency of the events .",
    "the number of pulses @xmath25 within the time interval @xmath26 follows a poisson distribution @xmath27 following previous approaches @xcite we consider @xmath28-impulses of the same amplitude @xmath29 : @xmath30 the poisson noise ( [ poi_noise ] ) is characterised by an infinite number of non - zero cumulants defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents an @xmath1-order cumulant . since the first cumulant is non - zero , the noise produces a bias @xmath33 which is removed by term @xmath0 in ( [ cnoise ] ) ( the middle current source in fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) , therefore @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we consider a zero - mean non - gaussian noise @xmath11 acting together with a white noise @xmath15 on the system ( [ sin_sys ] ) .",
    "all cumulants of @xmath11 are equal to cumulants @xmath32 except the first cumulant , which is equal to zero .",
    "the task consists of the estimation of the difference between two mean first - passage times ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) corresponding to the opposite signs in front of @xmath11 in ( [ sin_sys ] ) . both @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "are experimentally measured quantities which lead to an asymmetry factor @xcite @xmath37 the value of @xmath38 characterizes the asymmetry of the noise distribution and the lower index @xmath39 is used to stress that the factor is derived from measurements of times @xmath40 .",
    "due to escape having _ an activation character _",
    ", the times @xmath40 can be expressed in the following form  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the prefactor and action respectively , @xmath44 is an effective intensity of both gaussian and non - gaussian noise in ( [ sin_sys ] ) .",
    "further , it is implicitly assumed @xcite that prefactor @xmath42 can be omitted leading to the asymmetry factor in the form @xmath45 the subscript @xmath46 in  ( [ assym1 ] ) indicates that we need to measure actions @xmath43 rather than times @xmath40 .",
    "omission of the prefactors @xmath42 is equivalent to the assumption that @xmath47 .",
    "the validity of this assumption was not verified and we discuss this matter below .",
    "thus , the actions @xmath43 are the subject of theoretical approaches , whereas the times @xmath40 are measured experimentally .",
    "this indicates that the actions rather than @xmath40 must be extracted from experiments or numerical simulations for the proper use of the theory .",
    "note , that this aspect has not been addressed in published papers .",
    "although all previously suggested theoretical approaches @xcite are very similar , there is no unified framework to follow .",
    "therefore , we suggest our version which is based on the approaches described in publications  @xcite .",
    "this will enable us to compare two approaches : the first approach with only third cumulant taken into account and the second approach with all cumulants ( [ cumulants ] ) considered . in this way the importance of higher order cumulants will be investigated .",
    "the starting point of the theoretical development is the fokker - plank equation ( fpe ) corresponding to the langevin equation ( [ sin_sys ] )  @xcite ( see articles@xcite for details of the derivation of the term describing non - gaussian noise ) @xmath48 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha d \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}p + \\lambda \\left [ \\exp\\left(\\mp \\lambda \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y } \\right ) -1 \\right]p \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in equation ( [ fpe ] ) a new variable @xmath49 is introduced and @xmath50 is probability density .",
    "the exponent in the last term in ( [ fpe ] ) describes poisson noise and has the following maclaurin series representation @xcite : @xmath51 let us consider the solution of equation ( [ fpe ] ) in exponential form  @xcite , that is @xmath52 with action @xmath46 and the effective noise intensity @xmath44 .",
    "note that an exponential form has been used in all recent theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "however , particular forms of @xmath44 are varied from one approach to another .",
    "importantly , the proportionality symbol is used in ( [ expsc ] ) because equality would require an additional prefactor @xmath53 .",
    "effective noise intensity @xmath44 is an asymptotic parameter of the problem . assuming that higher cumulants of a non - gaussian noise are smaller than the second cumulant , @xmath44 can be chosen @xcite in the form @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath44 is proportional to the second moment of the sum of the gaussian and non - gaussian noises .",
    "note that the second moment is a quantity measured experimentally .",
    "the selection of @xmath44 and the form of ( [ expsc ] ) require an additional verification , which is performed later .",
    "following the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation @xcite , we substitute ( [ expsc ] ) into the fpe ( [ fpe ] ) and keep the leading order ( @xmath55 ) terms only .",
    "the latter formally means the use of the zero - noise limit as @xmath56 .",
    "the final result can be written as the following hamiltonian system of equations @xmath57   \\\\ \\dot{p}_x & = p_x \\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2 }   \\\\ \\dot{p}_y & = -p_x+\\alpha p_y    \\end{aligned } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ ham_sys ] ) , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are conjugated moments .",
    "in contrast to the gaussian case @xcite , the asymptotic parameter @xmath44 is not eliminated ; all the parameters characterising noise also present in the final system of equations ( [ ham_sys ] ) .",
    "the approach , however , can be only applied formally for @xmath60 . below",
    "we return to this point .",
    "system ( [ ham_sys ] ) has to be completed by two boundary conditions corresponding to a transition from the minimum of the potential @xmath61 to its maximum @xmath62 ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "these boundary conditions  @xcite specify a heteroclinic ( connecting two saddle states ) trajectory of system ( [ ham_sys ] ) and these are the following @xmath63 where @xmath22 and @xmath64 are the initial and final time moments . if the solution of the boundary problem exists @xcite , it can be used to calculate the action difference @xmath65 corresponding to the minimal energy required for the system to migrate from the bottom , @xmath66 , to the top potential , @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that @xmath68 and therefore @xmath69 . denoting coordinates of a heteroclinic trajectory as @xmath70 ,",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath64 are initial and final time moments , respectively ; signs of @xmath43 correspond to the signs of noise @xmath11 ( [ cnoise ] ) .",
    "action @xmath43 corresponds to the potential @xmath72 of the system if it is affected by gaussian noise only , whereas action is different in the presence of non - gaussian noise .",
    "the wkb approximation and action @xmath46 are being extensively applied for the analysis of fluctuations in non - equilibrium systems @xcite , whereas action @xmath46 specified a quasi - potential and has same meaning as potential in an equilibrium case .",
    "the latter means that the mean first - passage times @xmath40 can be presented in the following exponential form @xmath73 where @xmath43 is defined by ( [ action ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ bconds ] ) .    the theoretical approach presented above",
    "takes into account all cumulants of non - gaussian noise .",
    "the third cumulant approximation can be obtained from equations ( [ ham_sys ] ) by expanding the exponential function into a series ( [ expp ] ) and truncating all terms above @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian system is @xmath75 and corresponding action is defined as @xmath76 where index `` 3 '' in ( [ action3 ] ) is used to indicate the third order cumulant approximation .",
    "thus , systems ( [ ham_sys ] ) and ( [ ham_sys3 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ bconds ] ) and corresponding actions ( [ action ] ) and ( [ action3 ] ) describe effects of the presence of non - gaussian noise .",
    "we solve the boundary value problem using custom software  @xcite , following the approach described in paper  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the langevin equation ( [ sin_sys ] ) are extremely computationally demanding because the escape time @xmath40 should be lower than a characteristic relaxation time of the system ( [ sin_sys ] ) by a factor @xmath77 for mimicking the experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , for accelerating the simulations we replace the periodic potential @xmath78 in ( [ sin_sys ] ) by the third order polynomial @xmath6 with parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 to approximate one well of the periodic potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "note that the relative difference between the theoretically calculated actions @xmath43 for these polynomial and periodic potentials is less than 0.01% .",
    "numerical simulations were performed using a heun difference scheme , details of which can be found in publication@xcite .",
    "the poisson noise term was constant in each integration step and was calculated @xcite as @xmath81 , where @xmath29 and @xmath4 are the amplitude and frequency of the poisson noise , respectively ; @xmath26 is the integration step size and the value of @xmath82 is produced by a pseudo - random numbers generator with a poisson distribution ( [ p_dist ] ) .",
    "the applied scheme was verified against known theoretical results @xcite for linear systems perturbed by non - gaussian noise .",
    "first , we checked the scaling ( [ kramers1 ] ) alongside the selection of the effective noise intensity as @xmath83 .",
    "as it was mentioned above , our theoretical approach contains a self - contradiction : the asymptotic character of the wkb approximation aims to remove the explicit value of @xmath44 , but @xmath44 appears explicitly in the final expression .",
    "the same contradiction exists in previous theoretical developments @xcite too , because @xmath44 includes both gaussian , @xmath18 , and non - gaussian , @xmath84 , parts and this puts constraints on the way the parameter @xmath44 can be varied in numerical simulations to evaluate scaling ( [ kramers1 ] ) .",
    "as such the following factors have to be kept unchanged @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants , whereas the value of @xmath44 is varied .",
