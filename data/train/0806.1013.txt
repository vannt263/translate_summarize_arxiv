    "during the last 7 years , heavy - ion experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) have recorded a wealth of data in au+au , d+au , cu+cu , and @xmath0  collisions at a variety of energies , ranging from @xmath1  to the highest available au+au  energy , 200 .",
    "it is at these high energies that qcd predictions of new phenomena come into play under conditions where , over nuclear volumes , the relevant degrees of freedom are expected to be those of quarks and gluons rather than of hadrons , the realm of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "measurements from the four rhic experiments , brahms , phenix , phobos and star , have revealed compelling evidence for the existence of a new form of nuclear matter at extremely high densities and temperatures @xcite .",
    "detailed analyses of these data also make it clear that this hot , dense medium has surprising properties .",
    "the properties of the medium are those of a strongly coupled plasma , or sqgp , that behaves like a `` perfect liquid '' flowing with a near - zero viscosity to entropy ratio @xcite .",
    "the rhic observations have spurred significant advances in theory .",
    "however , a fundamental understanding of the medium seen in heavy - ion collisions at rhic does not yet exist .",
    "it requires new data that , in turn , necessitate enhanced capabilities of the rhic detectors and accelerator .",
    "a detailed plan is being developed by bnl to implement these upgrades in collaboration with the rhic scientific community .",
    "the main focus of this report is to outline the scientific opportunities in the heavy flavor sector provided by upgrades of the two large rhic detectors , phenix and star , in conjunction with an upgrade of the accelerator / collider facility , referred to as rhic ii .",
    "the detector upgrades will improve the acceptance , particle identification and secondary vertex detection capabilities of phenix and star .",
    "the rhic ii accelerator luminosity upgrade was originally proposed to be done using electron cooling .",
    "it is now planned to use a scheme that employs stochastic cooling and other upgrades to achieve for au+au  a factor of 5 increase in luminosity over present capabilities .",
    "this will provide about 70% of the average luminosity expected from electron cooling , but much sooner and at a much lower cost .",
    "the accelerator upgrades will include a new ion injector , ebis , which will provide high - intensity beams of nuclei as massive as uranium .",
    "this report is the result of the collaboration and research efforts of a rhic - wide heavy flavor working group .",
    "it provides a comprehensive overview of the physics questions than can be addressed by studies of open charm , open bottom and quarkonia at rhic ii .",
    "it also includes a detailed assessment of the accelerator and detector capabilities required to carry out these measurements with sufficient precision to resolve many of the outstanding issues by providing detailed results with which to make thorough comparisons to current and future theoretical calculations .",
    "this report is organized as follows . after a general introduction to heavy flavor physics , section 2 discusses the detector upgrade program at rhic .",
    "the projected yields of various heavy flavor measurements that can be achieved utilizing these upgrades and the higher rhic ii luminosities are discussed in section 3 . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we present a more detailed discussion of the motivation for studying open heavy flavor and quarkonia in heavy - ion collisions , respectively .",
    "we also include a review of the current theoretical and experimental status as well as the proposed experimental program .",
    "in section 6 we review the relationship between heavy flavor physics at rhic ii and the lhc .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "because charm and bottom quarks are massive , they are produced almost exclusively in the initial parton - parton interactions in heavy - ion collisions at rhic energies . in the absence of any nuclear effects",
    ", the heavy flavor cross sections in   collisions at rhic would simply scale with the number of binary collisions .",
    "thus departures from binary scaling for heavy flavor production in   collisions provide information about nuclear effects .",
    "these can be divided into two categories : effects due to embedding the colliding partons in a nucleus ( cold matter effects ) and effects due to the large energy density in the final state .",
    "the main focus of the heavy flavor program at rhic is to investigate the properties of the dense matter produced in   collisions by studying its effects on open heavy flavor and quarkonium production .",
    "this in turn requires a detailed understanding of cold matter effects so that they can be unfolded from the dense matter effects .",
    "the program thus requires detailed measurements and calculations of @xmath0  and @xmath2  heavy flavor cross sections to characterize the cold matter effects , if we are to quantify the differences between qgp and non - qgp effects .",
    "up - to - date benchmark calculations of the total open heavy flavor ( charm and bottom hadrons ) and quarkonium ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 families ) yields and spectra are imperative .",
    "cold matter effects that need to be included are nuclear shadowing , for both open heavy flavor and quarkonium production , and nuclear absorption of quarkonium .",
    "recent calculations of charm and bottom production to fixed - order next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) in @xmath0  collisions have been published @xcite , along with a discussion of the inherent theoretical uncertainties @xcite and reference calculations of heavy quark , heavy flavor meson and their decay lepton spectra @xcite .",
    "similar calculations have been made for quarkonium production , including studies of shadowing and absorption effects as a function of rapidity and centrality in d+au  @xcite and   @xcite collisions at rhic .    a number of dense matter effects on heavy flavor production have been predicted .",
    "some of these do not change the total cross section but , instead , modify the @xmath5 spectra of heavy flavor hadrons and their decay products .",
    "heavy quark energy loss @xcite by collisional and radiative processes steepens the @xmath5 distribution relative to that in @xmath0  collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "random @xmath5 kicks result in transverse momentum broadening , increasing the average @xmath5 in both cold nuclear matter  @xcite and in passage through hadron bubbles in the mixed phase of a qgp  @xcite .",
    "if the medium surrounding the heavy quarks after production exhibits collective motion , such as transverse flow @xcite , the low @xmath5 heavy quarks ( @xmath6 ) may be caught in this flow .",
    "strong effects of energy loss @xcite on heavy flavor decays to electrons and charm flow @xcite have already been seen in au+au   collisions at rhic .",
    "studying heavy flavor energy loss using single electrons requires being able to separate electrons from @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays since the large bottom and charm quark mass difference suggests that bottom quark energy loss is weaker than that for charm @xcite .",
    "some qgp studies require accurate baseline determinations of the total heavy flavor cross sections to interpret other effects .",
    "for example , if more than one @xmath9 pair is produced in an   event , uncorrelated @xmath7 and @xmath10 quarks might coalesce to form a @xmath3 in a qgp @xcite .",
    "the total @xmath9 yield is needed to normalize the @xmath3 production rate from this process .",
    "suppression of @xmath3 production was one of the most exciting proposed qgp signatures at the cern sps  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath3 suppression was predicted to occur due to the shielding of the @xmath11 binding potential by color screening , leading to the breakup of the quarkonium states , first the @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and finally the @xmath3 itself as the temperature increases @xcite .",
    "the qgp suppression may not be so simple , as lattice gauge theory studies of the @xmath3 spectral function above the critical temperature for deconfinement , @xmath14 , attest .",
    "the @xmath3 may exist as a bound state for temperatures considerably larger than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath3 may instead be dissociated by hot thermal gluons in medium @xcite before it could be suppressed by color screening .",
    "secondary quarkonium production from uncorrelated @xmath15 pairs , either in the plasma phase @xcite or in the hadron phase @xcite , could counter the effects of suppression , ultimately leading to enhanced quarkonium production .",
    "such secondary @xmath3 s would have different kinematic distributions than those from the initial production . because the underlying @xmath16 distribution falls rapidly with @xmath5 ,",
    "the @xmath5 distribution produced by coalescence will be softer . if the underlying @xmath16 distribution peaks at midrapidity , the @xmath3 rapidity distribution from coalescence will be narrower than that produced in the primordial collisions .",
    "the coalescence rapidity distribution should be calculated with shadowing effects on the underlying @xmath16 distribution taken into account since these can cause the @xmath16 distribution to flatten in more central   collisions @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow is also expected to affect quarkonium as well as open heavy flavors @xcite .    with higher luminosity at rhic",
    ", the @xmath4 yields could also be measured accurately .",
    "since the @xmath4 radius is smaller than that of the @xmath3 @xcite , direct color screening in the qgp would not occur until much higher temperatures .",
    "the higher mass bottomonium states , however , would likely be suppressed at rhic , as would the @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the charmonium family .",
    "the feed down structure is more complicated for the @xmath4 since there are three @xmath17 states ( @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and two sets of @xmath20 states ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) below the @xmath23 threshold .",
    "the @xmath4 family suppression should be measurable over a large @xmath5 range , with qgp suppression possible on the @xmath18 and @xmath19 up to @xmath24  at the lhc @xcite . because of the small number of @xmath25 pairs produced at rhic , bottomonium formation by coalescence of unrelated pairs should be negligible .",
    "heavy flavor measurements capable of discriminating between theoretical models need large integrated luminosity .",
    "in rhic runs so far , useful data sets have been acquired at 200  for @xmath0 , d+au , cu+cu  and au+au  collisions . the run 6 @xmath0  data are not fully analyzed yet , but a sizable data set is available from run 5 .",
    "recent runs for two species greatly increase the statistical reach over earlier runs : au+au  ( run 7 ) and d+au  ( run 8) .",
    "the data are still being analyzed , but some preliminary results are available from run 7 .",
    "the @xmath0  data collected to date provide an essential reference for the heavy - ion program in the form of the underlying heavy flavor production rates as functions of rapidity and @xmath5 .",
    "equally essential , the data from d+au  collisions provide baseline information about cold nuclear matter effects which must also contribute to heavy flavor production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the analyzed d+au  data from run 3 have limited statistical precision , but they provide useful tests of models that include the effects of shadowing on heavy flavor production and of @xmath3 absorption in cold nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the easiest way by far to measure open heavy flavor yields in heavy - ion collisions at rhic is via the semileptonic decays of @xmath26 and @xmath27 mesons .",
    "two very striking and unexpected results have already been seen by studying decay electrons from open heavy flavor in heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the first is the observation that the nuclear modification factor , @xmath28 , for electrons from open heavy flavor decays shows very strong suppression in central au+au  collisions @xcite , similar to that seen for pions .",
    "the second striking result is that the elliptic flow parameter , @xmath29 , of electrons from open heavy flavor decays appears to favor charm quark flow at low @xmath5 @xcite . until recently",
    ", it had been expected that heavy quark energy loss would be considerably smaller than that for light quarks due to interference effects @xcite .",
    "generating the necessary energy loss for charm and bottom quarks with realistic gluon densities in the material is a major challenge for models @xcite .",
    "the relatively large @xmath29 values at low @xmath5 imply at least some degree of charm quark equilibration with the medium .",
    "this also implies very strong interactions of charm quarks with the medium at lower @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a serious shortcoming of open heavy flavor measurements employing semileptonic decays is the difficulty of separating the contributions to the lepton spectra from charm and bottom decays .",
    "perturbative calculations of the relative contributions from charm and bottom as a function of  have large theoretical uncertainties : at midrapidity the crossover point at which bottom decays become dominant is between 3 and 9 .",
    "recently , however , the ratio of charm to bottom contributions has been extracted by star and phenix from @xmath0 data , although with still large uncertainties .",
    "the star measurements @xcite cover an electron  of @xmath30  and are based on small azimuthal angle correlations between the decay electrons and hadrons as well as correlation between electrons and identified @xmath31 mesons .",
    "the phenix bottom / charm ratio as a function of electron  @xcite was inferred from the shape of the electron - hadron correlation function .",
    "the star and phenix ratios are in good agreement and indicate that bottom becomes the dominant contribution to the electron spectra at @xmath32  ( see fig .  [ bb_cross_sections_all ] ) .",
    "a separate phenix measurement of the bottom and charm cross sections was also obtained from fits to the dielectron invariant mass spectrum , after removal of all other contributions @xcite .",
    "the results are in agreement with the cross sections inferred by phenix by combining the correlation measurements with electron  distributions .",
    "phenix has also measured open heavy flavor yields at forward rapidity , @xmath33 , using single muons @xcite .",
    "the charm cross section is @xmath34 @xmath35b .",
    "this is consistent with the measured values at @xmath36 but the precision is currently insufficient to meaningfully define the rapidity dependence .",
    "it is likely that the displaced vertex measurement from the planned vertex detector upgrades will be needed to determine the rapidity distribution .",
    "the first high statistics charmonium results for heavy - ion collisions at rhic are now available @xcite , along with high statistics @xmath0  reference data @xcite .",
    "these include au+au  and cu+cu  results for the @xmath3 @xmath37 as a function of the number of participant nucleons , @xmath38 , in the rapidity intervals @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a striking feature of the au+au  data is that , for @xmath41 , the suppression is considerably stronger at forward rapidity than at midrapidity .",
    "comparison with existing models at midrapidity shows that cold nuclear matter baseline calculations @xcite which approximately reproduce the rhic d+au  @xmath3 rapidity distributions @xcite somewhat underpredict the suppression observed in cu+cu  and au+au  collisions . on the other hand , several suppression models @xcite which were successful in describing @xmath3 suppression at the sps are found to strongly overpredict the suppression at rhic .",
    "models which incorporate strong suppression combined with @xmath3 coalescence from uncorrelated @xmath16 pairs seem to agree best with the data although the existing models slightly underpredict the suppression .",
    "a major source of uncertainty in all of this is due to the poor precision of the existing d+au  data , leading to poor constraints on the baseline cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "a recent reanalysis of the run 3 d+au  data @xcite used the higher yield run 5 @xmath0  data as the reference for calculating .",
    "theory calculations have been fit to the reanalyzed data to explore how well the data constrain cold nuclear matter effects in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "they find that the constraints from the run 3 d+au  data are insufficient for firm conclusions to be drawn about additional hot matter effects in central heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the newly obtained run 8 d+au  data set , approximately 20 times the yield of run 3 , will provide much improved statistical precision .    in the last few years ,",
    "theorists have begun exploring the consequences of @xmath3 coalescence on observables other than the centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xcite . this work has led to the prediction that @xmath3 s formed by coalescence of uncorrelated @xmath16 pairs will have narrower rapidity and @xmath5 distributions due to the presumed shape of the underlying charm quark distributions .",
    "the coalescence contribution to @xmath3 production will cause many observables to change with centrality , including the rapidity and @xmath5 dependence of @xmath37 , the shape of the @xmath5 distribution ( quantified by the average @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , and the @xmath3 elliptic flow parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "predictions of @xmath43 as a function of centrality have been made for au+au  and cu+cu  collisions with and without coalescence @xcite .",
    "these predictions , compared to the au+au  and preliminary cu+cu  data , favor calculations including coalescence .",
    "the coalescence contributions predicted for central au+au  ( as well as central cu+cu ) collisions @xcite are also qualitatively expected to narrow the @xmath3 rapidity distributions if the underlying charm distributions are peaked at midrapidity .",
    "the au+au  data @xcite show some narrowing of the rapidity distribution for the most central collisions although the reduction in rms is only about @xmath44 .",
    "work is still needed to quantify both the theoretical predictions and the experimental observables . a first measurement of the @xmath3 @xmath29 may come out of the run 7 au+au  data , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "the existing , but not yet analyzed au+au  data from run 7 will quantitatively improve the measurements of many heavy flavor observables .",
    "the @xmath3 @xmath37 versus centrality and @xmath45 as well as @xmath37 and @xmath29 measurements of charm and bottom semileptonic decays to single electrons will all improve significantly , allowing more stringent model tests . measurements of other observables will be qualitatively improved .",
    "examples are : definitive @xmath29 measurements from semileptonic decays at intermediate to high @xmath5 where we might hope to see the transition from charm to bottom dominance and flow to non - flow ; a possible first @xmath3 @xmath29 measurement ; substantially improved measurements of @xmath3 @xmath46 to quantify the coalescence contribution ; and improved measurements of @xmath3 @xmath47 , invaluable for understanding coalescence and formation time effects .",
    "however it is clear that the rhic heavy flavor program is now limited by the capabilities of the accelerator and the detectors .",
    "the accelerator upgrades planned over the period 2009 - 2013 to produce a factor of 5 greater luminosity at rhic ii , combined with the detector upgrades in place by that time , will be required for the heavy flavor program at rhic to move to the next level , as described below .",
    "the increase in luminosity , combined with the increased capabilities of the upgraded phenix and star detectors , will make it possible to add many important new probes to the heavy flavor program at rhic .",
    "one of the most powerful benefits of the luminosity upgrade will be the ability to measure yields of the excited charmonium states : the @xmath48 and @xmath12 .",
    "lattice calculations predict much smaller melting temperatures for the @xmath48 and @xmath12 than for the more tightly bound @xmath3 .",
    "thus these excited states should not be able to exist in the qgp at rhic and comparison of the @xmath48 and @xmath12 yields to the @xmath3 yield as a function of centrality would be a direct test of deconfinement .",
    "testing models in which the observed @xmath3 yield in heavy - ion collisions is due to competition between gluon dissociation and coalescence formation in the qgp requires very high luminosity .",
    "tests of charm coalescence models include measuring @xmath3 @xmath29 as a function of @xmath5 , @xmath3 @xmath37 to much higher @xmath5 to follow the trends of suppression as the @xmath3 formation time approaches the qgp crossing time , and @xmath3 polarization as a function of collision centrality .",
    "the rapidity and @xmath5 dependence of @xmath37 as functions of  and centrality , requiring sufficient luminosity for precision measurements at multiple energies , is not possible on a reasonable time scale at the present rhic luminosity .",
    "the detailed study of bottomonium states , the @xmath4 family , is only possible at rhic ii luminosities . like the charmonium states , the dissociation temperatures of the bottomonium states depend on the binding energies .",
    "there are , however , two important differences .",
    "first , the bottomonium binding energies , particularly that of the @xmath49 , are higher so that they should dissociate at higher temperatures .",
    "only the higher - lying bottomonium states are thus likely to break up at rhic energies .",
    "second , the @xmath25 production rate in central au+au  collisions is only @xmath50 pairs per collision , making coalescence production of bottomonium much less likely .",
    "thus bottomonium production at rhic ii will provide a very different window on color screening effects than charmonium production .",
    "the bottomonium yields at rhic ii should be sufficient for measurements of @xmath37 as a function of centrality in heavy - ion collisions for the three @xmath4 @xmath17 states .",
    "the @xmath4 yields at rhic ii and at the lhc will not be sufficient for @xmath29 or polarization measurements .",
    "as mentioned earlier , measurements of semileptonic open heavy flavor decays at rhic have already produced strikingly different results than expected .",
    "the strong suppression in @xmath37 coupled with the large @xmath29 suggest very large heavy quark energy loss in the medium .",
    "the fact that these semileptonic decay spectra contain both charm and bottom contributions remains a significant complication , in spite of recent successes by star and phenix at measuring the ratio of @xmath8 to @xmath7 quark contributions in the semileptonic decay spectrum of @xmath0  collisions .",
    "the separation of open charm and bottom can be done in several ways .",
    "charm can be observed via hadronic @xmath51 and @xmath52 decays , as star does .",
    "precise @xmath37 and @xmath29 measurements are difficult in this channel .",
    "since these events can not be triggered , they must be extracted from a minimum bias data set that samples only a small fraction of the available luminosity .",
    "the combinatorial background is also very large , making statistical precision difficult .",
    "the addition of a displaced vertex measurement in star will dramatically reduce the combinatorial background but there is still no trigger for these decays . at rhic",
    "ii luminosity , bottom can be observed very cleanly in both phenix and star via @xmath53 decays using displaced vertices , providing good measurements of the @xmath54 cross section and bottom quark @xmath37 .",
    "however those yields will certainly be too small for @xmath29 measurements at rhic ii or the lhc .",
    "finally , the combination of rhic ii luminosity with a displaced vertex measurement should allow statistical separation of the charm and bottom contributions to the semileptonic decay spectra , taking advantage of the different @xmath7 and @xmath8 quark decay lengths .",
    "such semileptonic decay measurements , while less clean than the direct @xmath26 and @xmath27 decay measurements , have the advantage of much larger yields so that separate charm and bottom @xmath29 measurements should be possible .",
    "independent measurements of open charm and bottom @xmath37 and @xmath29 to high @xmath5 will be a very important capability at rhic ii . at low @xmath5",
    ", these measurements reflect the degree of heavy quark thermalization in the medium . at high @xmath5",
    ", they probe the energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium , providing an independent measurement of the initial energy density relative to the light quark energy loss measurements . the thermalization and energy loss mechanisms at low and high @xmath5 respectively",
    "may be quite different due to possible resonance scattering at low @xmath5 .",
    "the heavy flavor production cross sections are significantly higher at the lhc than at rhic since the per nucleon pb+pb  energy at the lhc is a factor of 27.5 higher than the maximum per nucleon au+au  energy at rhic .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath54 cross sections increase by factors of 15 and 100 respectively @xcite while the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cross sections increase by factors of 13 and 55 respectively @xcite .",
    "but , because of the 10 times higher average luminosity and three times longer heavy - ion runs , the au+au  integrated luminosity at rhic ii will be much higher than for pb+pb  at lhc .",
    "therefore the heavy flavor yields per year are expected to be similar at the two facilities .    at @xmath55",
    ", bottom decays to leptons begin to dominate the single electron spectrum at @xmath56  . as the collision energy increases ,",
    "the lepton spectra from @xmath27 and @xmath26 decays move closer together rather than further apart @xcite .",
    "thus , the large increase in the @xmath54 cross section relative to @xmath11 does not make single leptons from @xmath27 and @xmath26 decays easier to separate .",
    "preliminary calculations show that the @xmath57 decay does become larger than that of @xmath58 , but at @xmath59  .",
    "the yields from the two lepton sources differ by less than a factor of two up to @xmath60  in the range @xmath61 .",
    "thus interpretation of single lepton results on heavy flavors will be more difficult at the lhc . other means of separating charm and bottom",
    "must be found .",
    "alice can reconstruct hadronic @xmath31 decays from @xmath62 to @xmath63   @xcite but , like star , will have to rely on minimum bias data for these measurements because of the lack of a trigger . while it is not yet clear what cms and atlas will do to reconstruct charm , they should be able to make @xmath8-jet measurements , similar to the tevatron .",
    "one way that @xmath27 mesons can be measured at the lhc is through their decays to @xmath3 , as discussed further below .",
    "it has also been suggested that the @xmath23 contribution to the dimuon continuum , the dominant contribution above the @xmath4 mass , can be used to measure energy loss @xcite .",
    "that channel would be fairly clean at the lhc but more difficult at rhic .",
    "the rhic ii upgrades and the high lhc energies make detailed studies of @xmath4 production and suppression possible . at the lhc ,",
    "higher initial temperatures make @xmath4 suppression more likely than at rhic ii .",
    "but the higher @xmath25 production rate ( @xmath64 per central pb+pb  collision ) means that , unlike rhic , significant coalescence contributions to @xmath4 production may be expected at the lhc .",
    "thus measurements at the two energies complement each other . at rhic ii , it is likely that phenix will be able to measure and resolve the three @xmath4 @xmath17 states . star and alice will have similar @xmath4 yields but the star mass resolution will require fitting to extract yields .",
    "the cms detector at the lhc has sufficient mass resolution to separate all three @xmath4 @xmath17 states .",
    "the @xmath4 states can be measured to @xmath62 at all lhc detectors .",
    "only alice will be able to measure @xmath3 production to @xmath62 without a special trigger @xcite since cms and atlas require high single muon @xmath5 so that typically only @xmath3 with @xmath65 several  are accepted .",
    "( however , cms is working on a higher - level trigger to measure lower @xmath5 @xmath3 @xcite . )",
    "the larger @xmath54 cross section at the lhc means that @xmath3 production from @xmath66 can not be neglected .",
    "these decay @xmath3 should be separable from the initial production using displaced vertices @xcite .",
    "both phenix and star have extensive upgrade programs underway that are extremely important for the heavy flavor program .",
    "the upgrades that are most relevant to heavy flavor measurements are described here .",
    "the impact on the heavy flavor program of these detector upgrades , in combination with the rhic ii luminosity increase , will be discussed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "+      several phenix detector upgrades that greatly enhance the heavy flavor capability of the experiment are expected to be available in the rhic ii time frame .",
    "the most important upgrades for the heavy flavor program will be the barrel @xcite and endcap @xcite silicon vertex detectors , the nose cone calorimeter @xcite and the muon trigger upgrade @xcite .",
    "the central region of the phenix detector , after installation of the silicon trackers and the nose cone calorimeter , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix_ncc_fvtx_picture ] .",
    "the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle coverages of the new detectors are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix_ncc_vtx_coverage ] .",
    "the silicon vertex detector ( svtx ) consists of a central barrel @xcite and two endcap detectors @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix_ncc_fvtx_picture ] .",
    "the svtx barrel will have a displaced vertex resolution of @xmath67 @xmath68 m while the endcap resolution is @xmath69 @xmath68 m .",
    "together , this inner tracking system provides full azimuthal coverage over @xmath70 .",
    "the svtx will tag heavy flavor decays using displaced vertices by connecting to tracks in both the central and muon arms , improving the quarkonium invariant mass resolution and reducing backgrounds to heavy flavor measurements . in the muon arms ,",
    "a loose displaced vertex cut will eliminate most muon tracks from light hadron decays and a very tight cut , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the resolution of the displaced vertex measurement , will eliminate most punch - through hadrons .",
    "the displaced vertex measurement will greatly enhance @xmath51 measurements in the central arms , presently very difficult in phenix , by reducing the contribution to the combinatorial background both from prompt tracks ( by using a tight vertex cut ) and light meson decay tracks ( by using a loose cut of @xmath73 cm ) .",
    "a loose displaced vertex cut will also reduce high @xmath5 background tracks in the central arms due to misidentified light hadron decays .",
    "in addition to identifying semileptonic heavy flavor decays , displaced vertex measurements can help identify @xmath3 s from @xmath27 meson decays since all other @xmath3 s are prompt .",
    "the svtx barrel is presently under construction .",
    "it will consist of four concentric silicon layers .",
    "the two inner layers , at radii of 2.5 and 5.0 cm , consist of pixel detectors with a segmentation of 50 @xmath35 m by 425 @xmath35 m .",
    "the outer two layers , with radii of 10 and 14 cm , consist of 80 @xmath68 m by 3 cm strips .",
    "the occupancy of the inner layer will be about 4.5% in central au+au  collisions .",
    "the svtx barrel produces a dramatic improvement in high @xmath5 track resolution in the central arms .",

    "the new tof system covering the full outer barrel of the tpc is being constructed and installed in star over the next two years .",
    "the system uses the multi - gap resistive plate chamber ( mrpc ) technology developed at cern and will consist of 3840 mrpc modules with 23,000 channels of readout @xcite .",
    "the modules will cover the tpc outer barrel ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) and will be mounted in 120 trays which will replace the existing ctb scintillation counter trays and tof patch .",
    "the tof triples the current momentum range over which @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 can be identified , considerably improving charm meson and baryon reconstruction .",
    "when the tof measurement is combined with the tpc @xmath89 measurement , electrons can be cleanly identified from the lowest momentum measured , @xmath75 200 , up to a few .",

    "in addition to the increased physics capabilities from the daq upgrade , the replacement of the tpc fee , specifically the readout boards ( rdo ) that collect data from the fee boards , will make space for a future precision tracking chamber between the tpc end planes and the endcap calorimeter . replacing the tpc fee",
    "also assures that this system can be maintained for the next decade or more .",
    "the readouts of the other existing detectors , which will remain in place for the rhic ii era , are being adapted to the new high speed daq with only minor changes .        in order to address heavy quark energy loss and thermalization",

    "the recent results from both star and phenix on the suppression and flow of non - photonic electrons are intriguing . however , without an identified charm sample , the contributions from semileptonic bottom decays and systematic errors on background subtraction make a clear interpretation of these results difficult .",
    "measurement of the yields of various charm species will also allow the study of charm hadrochemistry .",
    "efficient topological reconstruction of open charm decays requires a tracking  point - back \" resolution to the primary collision vertex of @xmath67 @xmath35 m or less .",
    "further , the beam pipe and innermost detector layers must be very thin to measure the low @xmath5 particles , which comprise the bulk of the cross section , and thus minimize the systematic errors in extrapolating the measured yield to the total yield . a thin beam pipe and inner detector layers are also key elements in efficiently vetoing photon - conversion electrons which , along with electron identification from the tpc , tof and electromagnetic calorimeter , will measure the soft lepton and dilepton spectra .",
    "star is thus developing a tracking upgrade for the central rapidity region , the heavy flavor tracker ( hft ) .",
    "the essential elements under consideration for the hft are a new thin , small - radius beam pipe ( 0.5 mm thick , 20 mm radius ) , two layers of thinned ( 50 @xmath35 m ) cmos pixel detectors at average radii of 2.5 and 8 cm ( pxl ) and one layer of low mass silicon strip - pad sensors ( ist ) at 17 cm , see fig .",

    "these layers will replace the existing three layers of silicon drift detector ( svt ) .",
    "it will be necessary to replace the svt since , when rhic",

    "in fact , it is possible to turn this uncertainty into an advantage and probe the medium properties using the observed @xmath3 momentum distributions .",
    "two extremes can be considered @xcite : either the initial @xmath7 quark distributions are unchanged by the presence of the medium or the @xmath7 quarks are thermalized . if the charm quark distributions in the medium are identical to those of the initial production process , the interactions of charm quarks with the medium would be very weak . in this case , both the @xmath3 rapidity and @xmath5 distributions will be narrower than if no plasma is formed simply because the center of mass energy of secondary @xmath3 production is lower than that of the initial nucleon - nucleon interactions . the lower energy results in a reduced @xmath43 and a narrower rapidity distribution .",

    "any @xmath3 s produced from thermalized charm quarks flowing with the medium would have a @xmath5 distribution with a slope characteristic of the temperature of the system at the time they were formed , resulting in even narrower rapidity and @xmath5 distributions . in either case",
    ", the effect would be largest in central collisions , reverting to `` normal '' broadening in peripheral collisions where on the order of one or fewer @xmath9 pairs will be produced since the number of @xmath9 pairs scales approximately with the number of collisions .",
    "the @xmath43 of coalescence and suppression has been calculated by several groups @xcite .",
    "no realistic calculations of the rapidity distribution from models including  coalescence are available for heavy - ion collisions so far but , based on the assumption of an underlying open charm distribution peaked at @xmath129 = 0 , it is predicted @xcite that a strong charm coalescence contribution to @xmath3 production will lead to a narrowing of the rapidity distribution , similar to the @xmath5 distribution .    in order to extract the medium properties from secondary @xmath3 production , systematic studies of @xmath3 production in @xmath0 , @xmath2  and   interactions are necessary .",

    "figure [ fig : star_upsilon ] shows the @xmath4 mass spectrum without the material from the inner tracking system . whether the resolution with the new inner tracking system ( hft ) installed is sufficient to resolve all 3 states depends on the final design parameters of the new detectors .",
    "although the yields are small relative to the @xmath3 , bottomonium measurements are quite clean .",
    "the states are massive ( @xmath145 ) so that their decay leptons have relatively large momenta and are thus easily distinguished from background leptons .",

    "measurement of the excitation function for this ratio over @xmath192  could help to disentangle suppression from enhancement .",
    "such measurements , however , are extremely demanding statistically since both heavy quarks and quarkonia will need to be measured with good statistics over a wide energy range .    a measurement of the quarkonium nuclear modification factor at high  can provide a unique experimental probe of energy loss and color diffusion @xcite . at relatively large transverse momentum , suppression due to color screening and coalescence are predicted to be negligible .",
    "instead , the quarkonium state is a hard probe that interacts with the medium .",
    "in particular , any color octet can suffer energy loss .",
    "the relative abundance of charmonium resonances can provide an experimental handle on such phenomena as each resonance may have a different octet contribution .",
    "we must exercise caution , however , as competing charmonium production models exist . in parallel with nucleus - nucleus studies , it is therefore important to investigate and compare production mechanisms in @xmath0  and @xmath2  interactions , at both central and forward rapidities @xcite .",
    "in addition to the baseline quarkonium measurements in @xmath0  and @xmath2   collisions listed in table  [ tab : quarkonia - req ] , other measurements are required as model input for description of the @xmath181 measurements .",

    "it is crucial for the interpretation of the   quarkonia yields to understand the feed down contributions from the @xmath12 states , see fig .",
    "[ fig : feeddown ] . the best feed down measurement will be made in 500  @xmath0  collisions because the increased luminosity and increased charmonium production cross sections lead to @xmath196 times larger charmonium yields than in 200  @xmath0   collisions .",
    "since the @xmath12 contribution to the @xmath3 yield will not change significantly between 200 and 500 , the increased yield at 500   will provide a definitive baseline measurement of @xmath12 feed down in @xmath0  collisions .",
    "recently , quarkonium polarization measurements were suggested as signatures of qgp formation @xcite .",
    "the quarkonium yields at rhic ii will be large enough to permit a @xmath3 polarization measurement at low @xmath5 by both phenix and star .",
    "the major differences between quarkonium studies at rhic ii and at the lhc will be the temperature and lifetime of the medium , the relative production cross sections , luminosities and run times .",
    "the initial temperature in @xmath197 tev central pb+pb   collisions at the lhc is expected to be @xmath198 , while it is @xmath199 in = 200   central au+au  collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "the qgp lifetime at the lhc is expected to be two to three times longer than at rhic @xcite .",
    "heavy flavor production cross sections are much larger at the lhc .",
    "the open charm and bottom production cross sections are @xmath200 and @xmath201 times higher respectively @xcite .",
    "the charmonium and bottomonium cross sections are @xmath202 and @xmath203 times higher respectively than at rhic @xcite .",
    "the higher lhc open heavy flavor cross sections increase the number of @xmath16 and @xmath25 pairs produced in central   collisions .",
    "there are @xmath145 and @xmath204 pairs , respectively , in au+au  collisions at rhic , while there should be @xmath205 and @xmath64 pairs in central pb+pb  collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the rhic ii au+au  average luminosity is projected to be 10 times larger than the lhc pb+pb  luminosity ( @xmath206 @xmath207 s@xmath208 relative to @xmath209 @xmath207 s@xmath208 ) .",
    "the yearly heavy - ion runs at rhic ii are also expected to be considerably longer than at the lhc .",
    "taking the polarized @xmath0   program at rhic ii into account , the heavy - ion program is expected to get @xmath210 week physics runs on average per year while the lhc heavy ion program will be allocated a one month physics run per year .",
    "thus the annual integrated luminosity at rhic ii is expected to be about 30 times larger for heavy ions than at lhc .",
    "the larger heavy flavor cross sections at the lhc are approximately balanced by the increased luminosity and running times at rhic ii , making the heavy flavor yields per year similar .",
    "thus the types of measurements that can be made at the two facilities will also be similar as well as of similar quality ( see tables  [ rhic1_rhic2_yields_phenix ] ,  [ rhic1_rhic2_yields_star ] and  [ lhc_yields_all ] )",
    ". however , there will be important differences in the physics environments prevailing at the two facilities which will make the two programs complementary .",
    "the higher initial energy density at the lhc means that the qgp will be created at a significantly higher temperature with a correspondingly strong potential for new physics effects at the lhc .",
    "in addition , the factor of ten increase in @xmath16 pairs and the factor of 100 increase in @xmath25 pairs per central collision at the lhc will have a major impact on the interpretation of heavy flavor measurements .",
    "we will discuss some of those differences here .",
    "lattice calculations suggest that the @xmath3 may remain bound at the highest rhic temperatures , while the excited charmonium states are predicted to be unbound . at the lhc , all of the charmonium states should be unbound at the highest temperatures , implying that almost all charmonium production in central pb+pb  collisions at the lhc will be due to coalescence of @xmath16 pairs .",
    "thus the prompt charmonium yields at the lhc should reflect only the coalescence mechanism with no contribution from the primordial @xmath3 production except in very peripheral collisions . the measurements at rhic and the lhc will thus provide very different windows on charmonium suppression in the qgp that will help resolve the ambiguities in interpreting data due to the balance between destruction and coalescence formation of charmonium at rhic .",
    "because of its higher binding energy , the characteristics of bottomonium production at the lhc should be similar to those of charmonium at rhic .",
    "the bottomonium states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom_states ] .",
    "the @xmath49 may remain bound at the highest temperatures at the lhc while the other bottomonium states will be dissociated .",
    "given @xmath64 @xmath25 pairs in central pb+pb  collisions ( relative to @xmath145 @xmath16 pairs at rhic ) , the @xmath4 yield at the lhc is predicted @xcite to reflect a balance between dissociation and coalescence reminiscent of the rhic @xmath3 production models .",
    "however , at rhic , the bottomonium dissociation rates will be significantly different .",
    "while the @xmath49 is predicted to be bound , the @xmath184 may also remain bound . only the @xmath185 is likely to dissociate at rhic .",
    "also , since the @xmath25 pair yield at rhic is @xmath204 per central au+au  collision , no significant bottomonium production by coalescence is expected .",
    "thus the bottomonium yields at rhic ii should reflect only qgp suppression .",
    "measurements at rhic ii and the lhc will thus provide very different windows on bottomonium suppression in the qgp that will help to resolve the ambiguities in interpretation due to the balance of bottomonium destruction and coalescence at the lhc .",
    "the open heavy flavor programs at rhic ii and the lhc will consist of similar measurements with similar goals . they will study energy loss , thermalization and flow of heavy quarks in systems with very different energy densities , interaction cross sections and lifetimes . however , not all challenges in the measurements are similar . at @xmath211",
    ", bottom decays to leptons begin to dominate the single electron spectrum at @xmath56  . as the collision energy increases ,",
    "the lepton spectra from @xmath27 and @xmath26 decays move closer together rather than further apart .",
    "thus , the large increase in the @xmath54 cross section relative to @xmath212 does not make single leptons from @xmath27 and @xmath26 decays easier to separate .",
    "preliminary calculations show that the @xmath213 decay does become larger than that of @xmath214 but only for @xmath59  .",
    "the two lepton sources differ by less than a factor of two to @xmath215  in the range @xmath61 .",
    "separating single leptons from charm and bottom decays will require statistical separation using differences in the displaced vertex distributions at all @xmath5 at the lhc .",
    "thus interpretation of single lepton data from heavy flavor decays will be more difficult at the lhc .",
    "alice can reconstruct @xmath31 decays from @xmath62 to @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "like star , alice will be unable to trigger on @xmath31 s and will have to obtain these events from the minimum bias sample .",
    "thus the longer running times at rhic are an advantage since more minimum bias data can be taken ( see tables  [ rhic1_rhic2_yields_star ] and  [ lhc_yields_all ] ) .",
    "while it is not yet clear what cms and atlas will do to reconstruct charm , they should be able to do @xmath8 jets well , similar to the tevatron measurements .",
    "as at rhic , @xmath27 mesons can be measured cleanly at the lhc through their decays to @xmath3 , although triggering on low @xmath5 @xmath3 s is difficult at the lhc .",
    "it has also been suggested that the @xmath23 contribution to the dimuon continuum , the dominant contribution above the @xmath4 mass , can be used to measure energy loss @xcite .",
    "that channel would be fairly clean at the lhc but more difficult at rhic .",
    "we have shown that , so far , the rhic heavy flavor physics program has been very rich and stimulating , with many provocative and challenging results .",
    "to fully realize the potential of this compelling program , however , both detector upgrades and a luminosity upgrade are mandatory .",
    "detector upgrades will improve reconstruction of charm hadron decays into hadronic channels and allow detection of @xmath53 decays using secondary vertex measurements .",
    "upgrades will also make @xmath12 detection possible and , in the case of star , lead to significant quarkonium yields .",
    "however only increased luminosities will allow high statistics measurements of all of these yields as well as increase the @xmath5 reach of @xmath3 and heavy flavor @xmath37 and @xmath29 .",
    "we have also shown that the rhic ii and lhc heavy flavor physics programs are complementary .",
    "both are required for a complete understanding of heavy flavor production as a function of energy and temperature .",
    "we have also demonstrated that , despite lower heavy flavor cross sections at rhic , the longer running times and higher luminosity of rhic ii make the recorded yields similar at the two facilities .",
