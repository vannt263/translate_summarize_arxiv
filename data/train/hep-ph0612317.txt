    "an important component of the physics case for the international linear collider ( ilc ) is its ability to perform high - precision measurements in the higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "in addition to measuring the higgs mass , its spin and cp quantum numbers , and its self - coupling which characterizes the shape of the higgs potential , the ilc will measure the higgs couplings to a variety of standard model ( sm ) particles . in the sm ,",
    "the masses of these particles arise solely through their couplings to the higgs , so that these couplings are predicted in terms of the corresponding sm particle masses .",
    "the sm higgs production cross sections and decay branching ratios are then fixed once the higgs mass has been measured .    in extended models ,",
    "however , the masses of the sm particles can receive contributions from more than one source , e.g. , from couplings to each of two higgs doublets .",
    "further , the sm - like higgs boson in extended models is typically an admixture of states from different scalar multiplets , leading to modifications of its couplings to sm particles by additional mixing angles .",
    "the high - precision ilc measurements of higgs couplings thus provide a powerful tool for probing the structure of the higgs sector and distinguishing the minimal sm from extended models .",
    "previous studies  @xcite have quantified the `` reach '' of the ilc measurements within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in this paper we study the impact on this reach due to the theoretical and parametric uncertainties that enter the sm predictions for the higgs cross section and decay branching ratios .",
    "a first attempt at including the parametric uncertainties from the strong coupling and the bottom and charm quark masses was made in ref .",
    "@xcite by varying these parameters within their uncertainties and treating the resulting variation in the sm higgs branching ratio predictions as an additional uncertainty to be added in quadrature with the uncertainty on the experimental measurement .",
    "an additional step was taken in ref .",
    "@xcite where the theoretical uncertainties in the sm @xmath10 rate were estimated based on the size of the computed radiative corrections .",
    "we refine and extend the analysis of the parametric uncertainties by taking into account their correlated effects on higgs observables .",
    "we also include the full set of current theoretical uncertainties in the sm higgs decay partial widths and production cross section , again taking into account their correlated effects on the ilc higgs observables .    with the theoretical and parametric uncertainties in hand , we must choose a measure to quantify their impact . we choose to work in the @xmath1 benchmark scenario of the mssm as defined in ref .",
    "we scan over points in the @xmath4@xmath11 plane and construct a chi - squared ( @xmath12 ) observable between the sm and mssm predictions .",
    "we plot contours of @xmath0 , corresponding to a @xmath13 discrepancy between the sm and the sample mssm point .",
    "these contours allow us to show the impact of adding each of the theoretical and parametric uncertainties on top of the experimental uncertainties . because the main purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the theoretical uncertainties , we make no attempt to scan over more general sets of mssm parameters or over non - supersymmetric models .",
    "we begin in the next section with a brief overview of the mssm higgs couplings .",

    "[ sec : inputs ] we collect the expected experimental uncertainties in the higgs measurements and describe our treatment of the theoretical and parametric uncertainties , which typically feed in to multiple measurements in a correlated way .",
    "we provide a table of the dependence of individual higgs decay partial widths on the input parameters @xmath8 , @xmath14 and @xmath2 so that our study can be updated in a straightforward way if the precision on these parameters improves .",

    "the current state of the art for the radiative corrections to sm higgs decays , higgs production in @xmath15 , and the bottom and charm quark mass extraction from low - energy experimental data is reviewed in appendices  [ app : thy ] , [ app : xsec ] , and [ app : mbmc ] , respectively .",
    "the couplings of the lightest cp - even higgs boson @xmath16 of the mssm can be written at tree level in terms of the corresponding sm higgs couplings as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mixing angle that diagonalizes the mass matrix for the cp - even states @xmath16 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two mssm higgs doublets . at tree level",
    "we have @xmath21 where @xmath4 is the mass of the cp - odd neutral mssm higgs boson .",
    "note that in the _ decoupling limit _",

    "in particular , for large @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath27 exhibit the largest deviations from their sm values , while @xmath28 approaches its sm value very quickly with increasing @xmath4 .    beyond tree level ,",
    "the higgs couplings receive radiative corrections , which mainly impact the cp - even higgs mass matrix  @xcite .",
    "these can be taken into account by defining an effective mixing angle @xmath29 for use in place of @xmath18 in the above formulas .",
    "significant radiative corrections can also appear in the @xmath30 vertex due to squark - gluino loops , with their dominant piece parameterized as @xmath31  @xcite . including this vertex correction , the @xmath30 coupling can be written as  @xcite @xmath32    \\frac{1 - \\delta_b \\cot\\alpha \\cot \\beta}{1 + \\delta_b}.\\ ] ] in the limit of large @xmath4 , @xmath33 and the @xmath31 corrections also decouple .    in this paper",
    "we make our @xmath12 comparisons using the implementations of the sm and mssm higgs couplings in the public fortran code hdecay  @xcite .",
    "hdecay computes the @xmath16 couplings using the @xmath29 approximation , incorporating also the potentially significant @xmath31 corrections to the @xmath34 coupling .",
    "for the loop - induced couplings of @xmath16 to photon or gluon pairs , hdecay includes the shift in the contribution from sm particles in the loop calculation in hdecay , to be consistent with its inclusion in the mssm calculation . ] due to the modified couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgscoups ] ) , as well as the new contributions to the amplitude from supersymmetric particles running in the loop and from the charged higgs boson for @xmath35 . for comparisons involving mssm higgs production cross sections in @xmath36 fusion and @xmath37 associated production , we scale the corresponding sm production cross section by @xmath38 ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) using the @xmath29 approximation of hdecay . we neglect the additional non - universal susy electroweak radiative corrections ( e.g. , box diagrams ) beyond this approximation . while a full mssm analysis should include complete non - universal susy corrections to higgs partial widths and production cross sections , the approximations used in hdecay are sufficient for our purposes in this paper .",
    "to quantify the impact of the experimental and theoretical uncertainties on the ability of ilc measurements to reveal deviations from the sm , we construct a @xmath12 according to @xmath41^{-1}_{ij } ( q_j^{m_1 } - q_j^{m_2}),\\ ] ] where @xmath42 are the observables being compared between models @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and @xmath45^{-1}_{ij}$ ] is the inverse of the covariance matrix for the quantities @xmath42 , defined according to @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the uncorrelated uncertainty in the observable @xmath42 , @xmath48 represents the @xmath49th source of correlated uncertainty in @xmath42 , and @xmath50 is the kronecker delta . in the absence of correlated uncertainties , @xmath51 is a diagonal matrix with the ( positive definite ) squares of the uncorrelated uncertainties @xmath47 down the diagonal .",

    "because the @xmath93 quark masses are short - distance mass definitions , they are in principle free of this ambiguity .      the charm mass has recently been extracted  @xcite from a global fit to @xmath94 meson decay spectra  @xcite .",

    "@xcite from the @xmath126 spectrum .",
    "the bare mass on the lattice was extracted with 12% uncertainty , which is mostly systematic and due to missing radiative corrections to the leading relativistic and discretization corrections to the @xmath126 binding energies .",
    "the bare mass on the lattice depends on the lattice spacing , which cuts off the effective theory on the lattice ; it can be converted to the @xmath93 mass without encountering infrared problems .",

    "a two - loop calculation of the heavy quark self - energy to reduce the conversion error is underway  @xcite . reducing the error in @xmath128 to the level of the uncertainty in the bare lattice mass would make the lattice determination of @xmath128 competitive with that from inclusive @xmath94 meson decay distributions discussed above .",

    "<S> we study the effect of theoretical and parametric uncertainties on the ability of future higgs coupling measurements at the international linear collider ( ilc ) to reveal deviations from the standard model ( sm ) . to quantify the impact of these uncertainties we plot @xmath0 contours for the deviations between the sm higgs couplings and the light higgs couplings in the @xmath1 benchmark scenario of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the theoretical uncertainties in the sm higgs decay partial widths and production cross section and the parametric uncertainties in the bottom and charm masses and the strong coupling @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the impact of the theoretical and parametric uncertainties is moderate in the first phase of ilc data - taking ( 500 fb@xmath3 at 350 gev centre - of - mass energy ) , reducing the `` reach '' in the cp - odd mssm higgs mass @xmath4 by about 10% to @xmath5  gev , while in the second phase ( 1000 fb@xmath3 at 1000 gev ) these uncertainties are larger than the experimental uncertainties and reduce the reach in @xmath4 by about a factor of two , from @xmath6 down to @xmath7  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the effect comes from the parametric uncertainties in @xmath8 and @xmath2 , followed by the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath9 . </S>"
