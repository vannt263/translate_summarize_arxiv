    "axions are hypothetical weakly interacting particles whose existence was proposed about 35 years ago as a solution to the strong charge - parity problem in quantum chromodynamics ( peccei & quinn 1977 ; weinberg 1978 ; wilczek 1978 ) .",
    "they are well - motivated candidates for dark matter of the universe , and their contribution depends on their mass ( raffelt 2007 ) , a quantity that is not given by the theory that predicts their existence .",
    "there are two types of axion models : the kvsz model ( kim 1979 ; shifman et al . 1980 ) , where the axions couple with photons and hadrons , and the dfsz model ( dine et al . 1981 ; zhimitskii 1980 ) , where they also couple to charged leptons like electrons .",
    "in this paper , we are interested in dfsz axions , those that interact with electrons .",
    "the coupling strength of dfsz axions to electrons is defined through a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath3 , which is related to the mass of the axion , @xmath4 , through the relation :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is a free , model - dependent parameter that is usually set equal to unity .",
    "because theory does not place any constraint on the mass of axions , it must be inferred from terrestrial experiments or by using astrophysical and cosmological arguments . in particular ,",
    "stars can be used to put constraints on the mass of the axion ( raffelt 1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on white dwarf stars , which represent the final evolutionary stages of low- and intermediate - mass stars  see althaus et al .",
    "( 2010a ) and references therein .",
    "white dwarfs are excellent candidates to test the existence of weakly interacting particles , as it was early recognized by raffelt ( 1986 ) for the case of axions .",
    "because white dwarfs are strongly degenerate and do not have relevant nuclear energy sources , their evolution is described as a slow cooling process in which the gravothermal energy release is the main energy source driving their evolution . at the typical temperatures and densities found in the cores of white dwarfs ,",
    "the emission of dfsz axions is supposed to take place at the deepest regions of these stars through compton , pair annihilation , and bremmsstrahlung processes , although the last mechanism is the most relevant one ( raffelt 1986 ) . in this last case ,",
    "the axion emission rate is given by ( nakagawa et al .",
    "1987 , 1988 ) :    @xmath7 .",
    "\\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    the mass of the axions determines how strongly they couple to electrons ( eq .   [ eq1 ] ) and then , how large the axion emissivity is ( eq .   [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "since axions can ( almost ) freely escape from the interior of white dwarfs , their existence would increase the cooling rate , with more massive axions producing larger additional cooling .",
    "isern et al . ( 2008 , 2009 ) included axion emissivity in evolutionary models of white dwarfs and found an improved agreement between the theoretical calculations and the observational white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "this provided the first , although preliminary , indication that axions might indeed exist .",
    "pulsating da ( namely , stars with h - rich atmospheres ) white dwarfs , also called zz ceti or dav stars , are the most numerous class of degenerate pulsators , with over 148 members known today ( castanheira et al .",
    "they are characterized by multiperiodic brightness variations caused by spheroidal , non - radial @xmath1-modes of low degree ( @xmath8 ) with periods between 70 and 1500 s ( winget & kepler 2008 ; althaus et al",
    ". 2010a ) .",
    "the star g117@xmath0b15a ( also called ry lmi and wd 0921@xmath9354 ) is the best studied member of this class of variables .",
    "this star shows oscillation periods @xmath10 ( amplitudes @xmath11 ) of 215.20  s ( 17.36 mma ) , 270.46  s ( 6.14 mma ) and 304.05  s ( 7.48 mma ) that correspond to genuine eigenmodes ( kepler et al .",
    "1982 ) , and also shows the harmonic of the largest amplitude mode and two linear combinations .",
    "the 215  s mode is a @xmath12 mode , as inferred by comparing the uv pulsation amplitude ( measured with the _ hubble space telescope _ ) to the optical amplitude ( robinson et al .",
    "the rate of change of this period with time ( @xmath13 ) is very small , although still detectable , @xmath14 s / s ( kepler et al . 2011 ) .",
    "in fact , the stability of this period is comparable to that of the most stable millisecond pulsars ( kepler et al .",
    "g117@xmath0b15a has been the subject of numerous asteroseismological analysis , the more relevant ones being those of bradley ( 1998 ) , crsico et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , castanheira & kepler ( 2008 ) , bischoff - kim et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , and romero et al .",
    "in particular , the approach of romero et al .",
    "( 2012 ) allowed to solve the degeneracy of asteroseismological solutions for g117@xmath0b15a found in previous analysis by taking into account the predictions of full stellar evolution calculations on the structure of da white dwarfs .",
    "the rates of period change of pulsation @xmath1-modes in white dwarfs are a very important observable quantity that can yield information about the core chemical composition . as a variable white dwarf evolves ,",
    "its oscillation periods vary in response to evolutionary changes in the mechanical structure of the star .",
    "specifically , as the temperature in the core of a white dwarf decreases , the plasma increases its degree of degeneracy so the brunt - visl frequency  the most important physical quantity in @xmath1-mode pulsations  decreases , and the pulsational spectrum of the star shifts to longer periods . on the other hand , residual gravitational contraction ( if present )",
    "acts in the opposite direction , thus shortening the pulsation periods .",
    "the competition between the increasing degeneracy and gravitational contraction gives rise to the detectable temporal rate of change of periods .",
    "in particular , it has been shown ( winget et al . 1983 ) that the rate of change of the pulsation period is related to the rates of change of the temperature at the region of the period formation , @xmath15 , and of the stellar radius , @xmath16 :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants whose values depend on the details of the white dwarf modeling ( however , both @xmath18 and @xmath20 ) . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - dotp ] ) corresponds to the rate of change in period induced by the cooling of the white dwarf , and it is a positive contribution , whereas the second term represents the rate of change due to gravitational contraction , and it is a negative contribution . in principle , the rate of change of the period can be measured by observing a pulsating white dwarf over a long time interval when one or more very stable pulsation periods are present in their light curves . in the case of pulsating da white dwarfs",
    ", cooling dominates over gravitational contraction , in such a way that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - dotp ] ) is usually negligible , and only positive values of the observed rate of change of period are expected .",
    "isern et al . (",
    "1992 ) raised for the first time the possibility of employing the measured rate of period change in g117@xmath0b15a to derive a constraint on the mass of axions . by assuming that the rate of change of the 215  s period of g117@xmath0b15a is directly related to the evolutionary timescale of the star , they considered the evolution of da white dwarfs models with and without axion emissivity , and compared the theoretical values of @xmath21 for increasing masses of the axion with the observed rate of period change of g117@xmath0b15a at that time . employing a semi - analytical treatment they obtained @xmath22  mev , assuming @xmath23 .",
    "later , crsico et al . ( 2001 ) found @xmath24  mev using a detailed asteroseismological model for g117@xmath0b15a . at the same time , the observational and theoretical uncertainties of the rate of period change were large enough that prevented to be conclusive about the necessity of an extra cooling mechanism such as axion emission .",
    "a few years later , bischoff - kim et al . (",
    "2008b ) derived an upper limit of @xmath25  mev for the axion mass using an improved asteroseismological model for the star and a better treatment of the uncertainties involved .",
    "since the value of the measured @xmath21 for the 215  s period of g117@xmath0b15a has been changing over the years and now it seems to have reached asymptotically a rather stable value around @xmath26 s / s , and since the modeling of da white dwarf pulsators has recently experienced major improvements ( althaus et al .",
    "2010b ) , we feel that now is the right time to reanalyze the issue of the asteroseismological determination of the axion mass .",
    "this is precisely the aim of the present paper .",
    "specifically , we employ the very detailed asteroseismological model for g117@xmath0b15a derived by romero et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and use the most recent measurement of the rate of change of the 215  s period to set new constraints on the mass of the axion .",
    "preliminary results of this research have been presented in crsico et al .",

    "( 2012 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ table3 ]    in order to estimate the uncertainties of the theroretical value of @xmath21 for the @xmath27 mode introduced by our lack of knowledge of the value of the @xmath28c@xmath29o reaction rate , we should compute a large number ( @xmath30 ) of da white dwarf evolutionary models like those computed in romero et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , employing different values of this nuclear reaction rate to account for its uncertainties . afterwards",
    ", for each value of the adopted reaction rate period fits to g117@xmath0b15a to find a suitable asteroseismological model should be performed .",
    "then , the comparison between the theoretical values of @xmath21 corresponding to the various best - fit models should allow us to estimate the uncertainties in the rate of period change induced by the uncertainty in the @xmath28c@xmath29o reaction rate . at present , due to the heavy computational load involved , this procedure is not feasible and is far beyond the reach of the present paper .",
    "instead , we have performed a two - step approximate estimate as described below .",
    "the first step consists in assessing the variation of the central abundances of c and o for different values of the nuclear reaction rate . to this aim , we computed two additional evolutionary sequences from the central he burning stage , assuming an enhanced and a reduced rate of the @xmath28c@xmath29o reaction . specifically , we multiplied by a factor @xmath31 and a factor @xmath32 the rate of angulo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , thus comfortably covering the quoted range of uncertainty for this rate . in table",
    "[ table3 ] we show the resulting central abundance of c and o in terms of the adopted rate . the case with @xmath33 corresponds to the standard rate given by angulo et al .",
    "note that an increase of @xmath34 in the rate translates into a modest enhancement of @xmath35 in the o abundance , although a reduction of @xmath36 in the rate results in a strong decrease of @xmath37 in the o abundance , being c more abundant than o in this case ( see table  [ table3 ] ) .    in a second step ,",
    "we estimate how the theoretical values of @xmath10 and @xmath21 of the asteroseismological model are affected when the central o is enhanced or reduced .",
    "to do so , we considered two white dwarf cooling sequences with different internal co ratios , but keeping the same structure parameters as those of the asteroseismological model .",
    "specifically , we artificially modified the o and c chemical profiles of the asteroseismological model at very high effective temperatures ( @xmath38 k ) , in such a way that the unphysical transitory associated to this procedure finishes long before the models reach the instability strip of zz ceti stars .",
    "the change consisted in replacing the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the stellar centre to the edge of the homogeneus co core corresponding to the case @xmath41 ( normal rate ) by the values obtained for @xmath42 ( enhanced rate ) and @xmath43 ( reduced rate ) according to table  [ table3 ] .",
    "after our _ ad hoc _ procedure , we allowed the models to cool down until they reached the effective temperature of g117@xmath0b15a . at this stage , we computed the periods and rates of period change .    the results for the mode with @xmath44 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] . due to the fact that this mode is trapped in the outer h envelope ,",
    "it is almost insensitive to the details of the co core chemical profile ( see sect .  [ propa ] ) . as a result",
    ", its pulsation period experiences a quite small decrease of @xmath45 when the central @xmath46o abundance strongly increases from @xmath47 to @xmath48 ( upper panel ) .",
    "this is at variance with the periods of the non - trapped modes ( @xmath49 , 3 and 4 , not shown in the figure ) , which undergo large changes , up to @xmath50 in the case of the @xmath51 mode .",
    "we found that the radial eigenfunction of the @xmath27 mode remains almost unchanged for the very different central o abundances , but the opposite holds for the modes with @xmath52 , and 4 . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] we depict how the rate of period change for the @xmath27 mode changes as a consequence of a varying central o abundance . not surprisingly , the value of @xmath21 for this mode exhibits a modest increase , of about @xmath53 .",
    "again , this is because this mode is trapped in the outer envelope .",
    "in sharp contrast , the other modes considered experience quite large changes , up to @xmath54 for the mode with @xmath55 .",
    "the increase of the rate of period change for the @xmath27 mode for increasing central o abundances can be readily explained using a simple relation obtained using the mestel cooling law ( mestel 1952 ) : @xmath56 [ s / s ]  see kepler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    the previous procedure , although not fully consistent , allows us to assess in an approximate way the impact of the uncertainties of the @xmath28c@xmath29o reaction rate on the value of the rate of change of the mode with @xmath57 .",
    "we adopt an uncertainty @xmath58 s / s for @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) .",
    "this is , indeed , a quite small uncertainty .",
    "another source of error in the theoretical values of @xmath21 comes from the uncertainties in the asteroseismological model for g117@xmath0b15a . in this sense",
    ", we are able to account for the _ internal _ errors of the period - fit procedure . examining the errors in the values of the stellar mass , the effective temperature and the thickness of the h envelope",
    ", we estimate that the uncertainty in the rate of period change for the mode with @xmath27 is @xmath60 s / s at most .",
    "this value is twice the error due to the @xmath28c@xmath29o reaction rate .",
    "in the previous section we have presented results of periods and rates of period change for g117@xmath0b15a that do not take into account other energy source than gravothermal energy for the evolutionary cooling of the star .",
    "we have found that the theoretically expected rate of period change of the mode with @xmath27 is markedly smaller than the value measured for g117@xmath0b15a , suggesting the existence of some additional cooling mechanism in this star . in this section",
    "we shall assume that this additional cooling can be entirely attributed to the emission of axions .    , @xmath61 and 4 , corresponding to our asteroseismological model for g117@xmath0b15a in terms of the axion mass .",

    "( 2001 ) , we have computed a set of da white dwarf cooling sequences incorporating axion emission .",
    "this has been done considering different axion masses and the same structural parameters ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) than those of the asteroseismological model .",
    "we have adopted a range of values for the mass of the axion @xmath64 mev , and we have employed the axion emission rates of nakagawa et al .",
    "the evolutionary calculations including the emission of axions were started at evolutionary stages long before the zz ceti phase to ensure that the cumulative effect of axion emission have reached an equilibrium value before the models reach the effective temperature of g117@xmath0b15a . in our models ,",
    "axion emission occurs mainly in the innermost regions at @xmath65 , reaching a peak at @xmath66 , although there is also a non negligible contribution from regions at @xmath67 .",
    "the pulsation periods for the modes with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and 4 of the asteroseismological model for increasing values of @xmath4 are depicted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "the variation of the periods is negligible , in spite of the rather wide range of axion masses considered .",
    "this result , which was first noted by crsico et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , implies that due to this additional cooling mechanism , the structure of the asteroseismological model itself is somewhat affected , but in such a way that , for a fixed value of the effective temperature , the pulsation periods are largely independent of the adopted value of @xmath4 .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] we display the rates of period change for the same modes . at variance with",
    "what happens with the pulsation periods , the values of @xmath59 are visibly affected by the additional cooling source , substantially increasing for increasing values of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the rate of period change of the mode with @xmath57 , which is the relevant one in the present analysis , increases by a factor of about 10 in the range of axion masses considered .",
    "this convincingly demonstrates that , in spite of the fact that this mode is less sensitive to the the evolutionary cooling of the star due to its mechanical properties ( mode trapping ) , it is still an excellent tool to constrain the mass of the axion , as it will be shown below .",
    "here , we focus on the mode with @xmath57 , for which we have a measurement of its rate of period change . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] we display the theoretical value of @xmath21 corresponding to the period @xmath70  s for increasing values of the axion mass ( red solid curve ) .",
    "the dashed curves embracing the solid curve represent the uncertainty in the theoretical value of @xmath21 , @xmath71  s / s .",
    "this value has been obtained considering the uncertainty introduced by our lack of precise knowledge of the @xmath28c@xmath29o reaction rate  @xmath72  s / s , see sect .  [ err - reaction ]  and that due to the errors in the asteroseismological model  @xmath73  s / s , see sect . [ err - astero ] .",
    "we are assuming that the uncertainty for the case in which @xmath74 is the same than that computed for the case in which @xmath75 .",
    "if we consider one standard deviation from the observational value , we conclude that the axion mass is @xmath76 mev .",
    "this value is about 4 times larger than the upper limit found by crsico et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and compatible with the more recent results of bischoff - kim et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "note that , _",
    "if _ we assume that the anomalous rate of cooling of g117@xmath0b15a is _ entirely _ due to the emission of axions , this value is an indirect measurement of the mass of the axion , and not just an upper bound .    , @xmath77 of our asteroseismological model in terms of the axion mass ( solid red curve with dots ) .",
    "dashed curves represent the errors in @xmath21 due to _ internal _ uncertainties in the modeling and in the asteroseismological procedure .",
    "the horizontal green lines indicate the observed value with its corresponding uncertainties ( kepler et al .",
    "in this paper we have derived a new value of the mass of the ( up to now ) elusive particle called axion . for this purpose",
    "we used a new asteroseismological model for g117@xmath0b15a , an archetypical zz ceti star , derived from fully evolutionary computations of da white dwarfs ( romero et al .",
    "2012 ) , and we employed the most recent determination of the rate of period change for the largest amplitude mode ( @xmath78 , @xmath27 , @xmath79  s ) of this star ( kepler et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we first compared the observed rate of period change for this mode , @xmath80  s / s , with the rate of period change of our asteroseismological model , @xmath81  s / s , computed under the assumption that the cooling of this star is governed only by the release of gravothermal energy . the fact that the observed value is more than 3 times larger than the theoretically expected one strongly suggests that this star is cooling faster than the standard theory of white dwarf evolution predicts .",
    "we have carefully taken into account the possible sources of uncertainties in the theoretical value of the rate of period change .",
    "we found that the uncertainties affecting the poorly determined @xmath28c@xmath29o reaction rate have no appreciable impact on the theoretical value of the rate of period change , because the mode is largely trapped in the outer h envelope of the asteroseismological model .",
    "this feature renders this mode almost insensitive to the fine details of the chemical structure of the co core .",
    "we also accounted for the internal uncertainties of the asteroseismological model , and found that in this case also the errors are of modest magnitude , and substantially smaller than the errors affecting the observed value of @xmath21 .",
    "next we assumed , following the idea first put forward by isern et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , that the additional cooling necessary to account for the large observed rate of period change of g117@xmath0b15a can be attributed to axion emission .",
    "following crsico et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we introduced axion emission in our asteroseismological model , considering a wide range for the axion mass ( between @xmath82 and @xmath83  mev ) .",
    "we found that the periods do not change , but the rates of period change are strongly affected by an increasing value of the axion mass .",
    "we found that the mass of axion necessary to account for the observed rate of period change is @xmath84  mev , where the errors in the axion mass come mainly from errors in the measurement of the observed rate of period change .",
    "this value of the axion mass is substantially larger than the upper limit derived by crsico et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , @xmath85  mev , but still in good agreement with the range of values obtained by bischoff - kim et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , @xmath86  mev",
    ".    we must emphasize at this point that the conclusion of our analysis for the existence of an extra cooling in g117@xmath0b15a due to axion emission , and the determination of a new value for the axion mass , are based on the fact that our set of full da white dwarf evolutionary models predicts that the @xmath27 mode ( 215 s period ) is strongly trapped in the outer h envelope .",
    "had this mode not been largely trapped in the outer layers , higher values of its rate of period change would have resulted , thus markedly weakening the potential of g117@xmath0b15a as a tool to constrain the axion mass . in this case , the uncertainties in our derived value for the axion mass should have been larger .",
    "we can estimate these uncertainties by considering the value of the rate of period change that the @xmath57 mode would have if it were non - trapped . a very simple way to do",
    "this is to assume that the mode should have a @xmath59 similar to the typical value of the rate of period change of the non - trapped modes with @xmath52 and 4 , that is , @xmath87 s / s .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath59 for the @xmath27 mode of the asteroseismological model could be @xmath88 s / s higher if it were a non trapped mode . by taking into account this uncertainty",
    ", we can not discard the non existence of the axion .",
    "all in all , we can safety conclude that , if the period at 215 s of g117@xmath0b15a is associated to a pulsation mode trapped in the h envelope , then the theoretical models strongly indicate that it would be necessary the existence of an extra mechanism of energy loss in this pulsating white dwarf , consistent with the existence of axions of @xmath89  mev . in the context of our full",
    "da white dwarf evolutionary models , we found that the @xmath27 mode is a trapped one for all the models characterized by structural parameters that place them in the neighborhoods of the asteroseismological model .",
    "so , the trapping of this mode in the h envelope appears very likely in the models , thus reinforcing our conclusion about the existence of axions with the quoted mass value .",
    "besides g117@xmath0b15a , the dav star r548 ( zz ceti itself ) is known to exhibit a change of its pulsation period at @xmath90  s with time ( mukadam et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this star is a potential objective to study axions by employing methods like the one presented in this paper .",

    "although these values can not be considered still as a _ measurement _ of the rate of period change , it is expected that a conclusive result in the near future will be obtained .",
    "isern et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have drawn the attention about the possibility of employing also pulsating db ( with he - dominated atmospheres ) white dwarfs ( dbvs ) to provide additional constraints to the axion mass . at present , there exist two pulsating dbvs for which is expected to have available a rate of period change measured in the next years .",

    "<S> we employ a state - of - the - art asteroseismological model of g117@xmath0b15a , the archetype of the h - rich atmosphere ( da ) white dwarf pulsators ( also known as dav or zz ceti variables ) , and use the most recently measured value of the rate of period change for the dominant mode of this pulsating star to derive a new constraint on the mass of axion , the still conjectural non - barionic particle considered as candidate for dark matter of the universe . assuming that g117@xmath0b15a is truly represented by our asteroseismological model , and in particular , that the period of the dominant mode is associated to a pulsation @xmath1-mode trapped in the h envelope , we find strong indications of the existence of extra cooling in this star , compatible with emission of axions of mass @xmath2  mev .    </S>",
