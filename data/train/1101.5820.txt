    "this paper has a two - fold motivation : to propose a  new construction for the ( subsequential ) scaling limits of the critical and near - critical percolation in the plane , and to show that such limits are two - dimensional _ black noises _ as suggested by boris tsirelson .",
    "percolation is perhaps the simplest statistical physics model exhibiting a phase transition",
    ". we will be interested in planar percolation models , the archetypical examples being site percolation on the triangular lattice and bond percolation on the square lattice .",
    "more generally , our theorems apply to a wide class of models on planar graphs , satisfying the assumptions outlined below .",
    "consider a planar graph and fix a _ percolation probability _",
    "@xmath0 $ ] .",
    "site percolation _",
    ", each site is declared _ open _ or _ closed _ with probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , independently of others . in the pictures",
    ", we represent open and closed sites by blue and yellow colors correspondingly .",
    "one then studies open _ clusters _ , which are maximal connected subgraphs of open sites . in _",
    "bond percolation _",
    ", each bond is similarly declared open or closed independently of others , and one studies clusters of bonds .",
    "percolation as a mathematical model was originally introduced by broadbent and hammersley to model the flow of liquid through a random porous medium .",
    "it is assumed that the liquid can move freely between the neighboring open sites , and so it can flow between two regions if there is an open path between them . fixing a quad @xmath3 ( @xmath4 a topological quadrilateral )",
    ", we say that there is an _",
    "open crossing _",
    "( between two distinguished opposite sides ) for a given percolation configuration , if for its restriction to the quad , there is an open cluster intersecting both opposite sides .",
    "one then defines the crossing probability for @xmath3 as the probability that such a crossing exists",
    ".    we will be interested in the ( subsequential ) scaling limits of percolation , as the lattice mesh tends to zero .",
    "it is expected that for a large class of models the _ sharp threshold _",
    "phenomenon occurs : there is a critical value @xmath5 such that for a fixed quad @xmath3 the crossing probability tends to @xmath6 for @xmath7 and to @xmath8 for @xmath9 in the scaling limit . for bond percolation on the square lattice and site percolation on the triangular lattice",
    ", it is known that @xmath10 by the classical theorem of kesten  @xcite .    in the critical case @xmath11 the crossing probabilities",
    "are expected to have nontrivial scaling limits . moreover ,",
    "those are believed to be universal , conformally invariant , and given by cardy s formula @xcite . for the models we are concerned with , this",
    "was established only for site percolation on the triangular lattice . however , the russo  seymour ",
    "welsh theory provides existence of nontrivial subsequential limits , which is enough for our purposes .",
    "our theory also applies to near - critical scaling limits like in @xcite , when the mesh tends to zero and the percolation probability to its critical value in a coordinated way , so as the crossing probabilities have nontrivial limits , different from the critical one .",
    "the russo  seymour ",
    "welsh theory still applies below any given scale .    having a ( subsequential ) scaling limit of the ( near ) critical percolation",
    ", we can ask how to describe it .",
    "the discrete models have finite @xmath12-fields , but in the scaling limit the cardinality blows up , so we have to specify how we pass to a limit .",
    "first , we remark that we restrict ourselves to the _ crossing events _ ( which form the original physical motivation for the percolation model ) , disregarding events of the sort `` number of open sites in a given region is even '' or `` number of open sites in a given region is bigger than the number of closed ones . ''",
    "while such events could be studied in another context , they are of little interest in the framework motivated by physics .",
    "furthermore , we restrict ourselves to the _ macroscopic _ crossing events , that is , crossings of quads of fixed size .",
    "otherwise , one could add to the @xmath12-field crossing events for microscopic quads ( of the lattice mesh scale or some intermediate scale ) , which have infinitesimal size in the scaling limit .",
    "the resulting construction would be an extension of ours , similar to a nonstandard extension of the real numbers .",
    "but because of the locality of the percolation , different scales are independent , so it wo nt yield new nontrivial information ( as our results in fact show ) .",
    "however , we would like to remark that in dependent models such extensions could provide new information .",
    "for example , kenyon has calculated probabilities of local configurations appearing in domino tilings and loop erased random walks @xcite , while such information is lost in describing the latter by an sle curve .    summing it up ,",
    "we restrict ourselves only to the scaling limit of the _ macroscopic crossing events _ for percolation ",
    "it describes the principal physical properties ( though adding microscopic events can be of interest ) .",
    "the question then arises , how to describe such a scaling limit , and several approaches were proposed .",
    "we list some of them along with short remarks :    _ random coloring of a plane _ into yellow and blue colors would be  a  logical candidate , since in the discrete setting we deal with random colorings of graphs .",
    "however , it is difficult to axiomatize the allowed class of `` percolation - induced colorings , '' and connectivity properties are hard to keep track of . in particular , in the scaling limit almost every point does not belong to a cluster , but is rather surrounded by an infinite number of nested open and closed clusters , and so has no well - defined color .",
    "_ collection of open clusters _ as random compact subsets of the plane would satisfy obvious precompactness ( for borel probability measures on collections of compacts endowed with some version of the hausdorff distance ) , guaranteeing existence of the subsequential scaling limits .",
    "however , crossing probabilities can not be extracted : as a toy model imagine two circles , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , intersecting at two points , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "consider two different configurations : in the first one , @xmath17 is an open crossing and @xmath18 is a  closed one ; in the second one , @xmath19 is an open crossing and @xmath20 is a  closed one . in both configurations ,",
    "the cluster structure is the same ( with  @xmath13 being the open and @xmath14 being the closed cluster ) , while some crossing events differ .",
    "thus one has to add the state of the `` pivotal '' points ( like @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) to the description , making it more complicated .",
    "constructing such a limit , proving its uniqueness , and studying it would require considerable technical work .    _ aizenman s web _ represents percolation configuration by a collection of all curves ( @xmath4 crossings ) running inside open clusters . here",
    "pre - compactness follows from the aizenman ",
    "burchard work @xcite , based on the russo  seymour ",
    "welsh theory , and crossing events are easy to extract . moreover",
    ", it turns out that the curves involved are almost surely hlder - continuous , so this provides a nice geometric description of the connectivity structure .",
    "however , there is a lot of redundancy in taking _ all _ the curves inside clusters , and there are deficiencies similar to those of the previous approach .    _",
    "loop ensemble_instead of clusters themselves , it is enough to look at the interfaces between open and closed clusters , which form a collection of nested loops .",
    "such a limit was constructed by camia and newman in @xcite from schramm s sle loops .",
    "however , it was not shown that such a limit is full ( i.e. , contains all the crossing events ) , and in general , extracting geometric information is far from being straightforward .    _",
    "branching exploration tree_there is a canonical way to explore all the discrete interfaces : we follow one , and when it makes a loop , branch into two created components .",
    "the continuum analogue was studied ( in relation with the loop ensembles ) by sheffield in @xcite , and this is perhaps the most natural approach for general random cluster models with dependence ; see @xcite .",
    "construction is rather technical , however the scaling limit can be described by branching sle curves and so is well suited for calculations .",
    "_ height function_in the discrete setting one can randomly orient interfaces , constructing an integer - valued height function , which changes by @xmath21 whenever an interface is crossed .",
    "this stores all the connectivity information ( at least in our setup of interfaces along the edges of trivalent graphs ) , but adds additional randomness of the height change . it is expected that after appropriate manipulations ( e.g. , coarse - graining and compactifying  i.e . , projecting @xmath22 to a unit interval )",
    "the height function would converge in the scaling limit to a random distribution , which is a version of the free field .",
    "this is the cornerstone of the `` coulomb gas '' method of nienhuis @xcite , which led to many a prediction .",
    "it is not immediate how to connect this approach to the more geometric ones , retrieving the interfaces ( @xmath4  level curves ) from the random distribution , but sle theory suggests some possibilities .",
    "also it is not clear whether we can implement this approach so that the extra randomness disappears in the limit , while the connectivity properties remain .    _",
    "correlation functions_similarly to the usual conformal field theory approach , instead of dealing with a random field as a random distribution , we can restrict our attention to its @xmath23-point correlations .",
    "for example , that would be the usual physics framework for fields arising in approach ( 6 ) , but to implement it mathematically we would need to reconstruct height lines of a field , based on its correlations , which is perhaps more difficult than developing ( 6 ) by itself , and possibly requires some extra assumptions on the field",
    ". a more geometric approach would be to study for every finite collection of points @xmath24 the probability @xmath25 that for every @xmath26 all the balls @xmath27 are connected by an open cluster . to obtain the correlation function ,",
    "one takes the double limit , passing to the scaling limit first and sending @xmath28 afterwards .",
    "since the probability of a radius @xmath29 ball being touched by a macroscopic cluster ( conjecturally ) decays as @xmath30 , one has to normalize accordingly , considering @xmath31 as a @xmath32-form .",
    "the geometric approach seems more feasible , but along the way one would have to further develop a version of cft corresponding to such `` connectivity '' correlations .    _ collection of quads crossed_in the discrete setting one",
    "can describe a  percolation configuration by listing the finite collection of all discrete quads ( i.e. , topological quadrilaterals ) having an open crossing .",
    "we propose a continuous analogue , described in detail below .",
    "the percolation configuration space thus becomes a space of quad collections , satisfying certain additional properties .",
    "_ continuous product of probability spaces _ , or _",
    "noise_this approach was advocated by tsirelson @xcite . in the discrete",
    "setting , the site percolation ( on a set @xmath33 of vertices ) is given by the _ product probability space _ @xmath34 .",
    "note that when @xmath33 is decomposed into two disjoint subsets , we obviously have @xmath35 straightforward generalization of the product space to the continuous case does not work : the product @xmath12-field for the space @xmath36 wo nt contain crossing events .",
    "instead tsirelson proposed to send the percolation measure space to a scaling limit , described by a _ noise _ or a _ homogeneous continuous product of probability spaces_. namely , for every smooth domain  @xmath37 the percolation scaling limit inside it would be given by a probability space @xmath38 , which is translation invariant , continuous in @xmath37 , and satisfies the property ( [ eqprod ] ) for a smooth domain @xmath33 cut into two smooth domains  @xmath39 , @xmath40 by a curve .",
    "there is a well - developed theory of such spaces , but establishing the latter property was problematic @xcite .    to most constructions",
    ", one can also add the information about the closed clusters , though in principle it should be retrievable from the open ones by duality .",
    "this list is not exhaustive , but it shows the variety of possible descriptions of the same object .",
    "indeed , in the discrete settings the approaches above contain all the information about macroscopic open clusters , and are expected to keep it in the scaling limit ; on the other hand with an appropriate setup [ one has to be careful , especially with ( 6 ) ] , we do not expect to pick up any extra information on the way .",
    "however , showing that most of these approaches lead to equivalent results , and in particular to isomorphic @xmath12-fields , _ is far from easy_.    we decided to proceed with the approach ( 8) , since it follows the original physical motivation for the percolation model , and also provides us with enough pre - compactness to establish existence of subsequential scaling limits _ before _ we apply any percolation techniques .",
    "it also serves well our second purpose : to provide escription of the percolation ( subsequential ) scaling limits , following tsirelson s approach ( 9 ) , and show that it is a _ noise _ , that is , a homogeneous continuous ( parameterized by an appropriate boolean algebra of piecewise - smooth planar domains ) product of probability spaces .    the question whether critical percolation scaling limit is a noise was posed by tsirelson in @xcite , where he has also noted that such noise must be nonclassical , or _ black _ ( compared to the classical white noise ) . the theory of black noises was started by tsirelson and vershik in @xcite . in particular , they constructed the first examples of zero and one - dimensional black noises ( and more of those were found since )",
    "; we provide the first genuinely two - dimensional example .    to establish that percolation leads to noise",
    ", it is enough to prove that its scaling limit , restricted to two adjacent rectangles , determines the scaling limit in their union .",
    "following is a version of this result , perhaps more tangible ( though stated slightly informally here ) .",
    "it is proved in proposition [ pmain ] , which is the most technical result of our paper .",
    "_ consider a rectangle _ , _ and a smooth path @xmath41 cutting it .",
    "we show that for every @xmath42 there is a finite number of percolation crossing events in quads disjoint from @xmath41 _ , _ from which one can reliably predict whether or not the rectangle is crossed , in the sense that the probability for a mistake is less than @xmath43 . _",
    "the essential point is that the set of crossing events that one looks at _ does not depend on the mesh of the lattice _ , which allows us to deduce the needed result , thus showing that any subsequential scaling limit of the critical percolation is indeed a _",
    "black noise_.      for completeness of exposition , we present most of the needed background below ; interested readers can also consult the books @xcite .",
    "we start with a rather general setup , which in particular includes all planar site and bond models ( as well as percolation on planar hypergraphs ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) . since we will be interested in scaling limits , it is helpful from the very beginning to work with subsets of the plane , rather than graphs .",
    "we consider a locally finite _ tiling _",
    "@xmath44 of the plane ( or its subdomain ) by topologically closed polygonal",
    "_ tiles _ @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , we ask it to be trivalent , meaning that at most three tiles meet at every vertex and so any two tiles are either disjoint or share a few edges .",
    "a _ percolation model _ fixes a percolation probability @xmath46 $ ] for every tile @xmath45 , and declares it open ( or closed ) with probability @xmath47 [ or @xmath48 independently of the others . in principle",
    ", we can work with a random tiling @xmath44 , with percolation probabilities @xmath49 satisfying appropriate measurability conditions ( so that crossing events are measurable ) .    more generally , we can consider a _",
    "random coloring _ of tiles into open and closed ones , given by some measure @xmath50 on the space @xmath51 with a product @xmath12-field ( which contains all events concerned with a finite number of tiles ) .",
    "percolation models correspond to product measures @xmath50 .",
    "we define open ( closed ) _ clusters _ as connected topologically closed subsets of the plane ",
    "components of connectivity of the union of open ( closed ) tiles taken with boundary .     independently of others .",
    "interfaces between open and closed clusters are pictured in bold . ]",
    "all site and bond percolation models on planar graphs can be represented in this way .",
    "indeed , given a planar site percolation model , we replace sites by tiles , so that two of them share a side if and only if two corresponding sites are connected by a bond .",
    "it is easy to see that such a collection always exists ( e.g. , tiles being the faces of the dual graph ; see figure [ fighex ] for the triangular lattice case ) .",
    "each tile is declared open ( or closed ) with the same  probability  @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) as the corresponding site .",
    "if our original graph is a triangulation , then the dual one is trivalent and only three tiles can meet at a point .",
    "however , when our graph has a  face with four or more sides , two nonadjacent sites can correspond to tiles sharing a  vertex ( but not an edge ) . to resolve the resulting ambiguity we insert a  small tile @xmath45 around every tiling vertex , where four or more tiles meet , and set it to be _ always closed _",
    ", taking @xmath52 .",
    "after the modification , at most three tiles can meet at a point , as required .",
    "bond percolation can also be represented by partitioning the plane into tiles",
    ". there will be a tile for every bond , site , and face of the original bond graph , chosen so that two different face - tiles or two different site - tiles are disjoint .",
    "moreover , a bond - tile shares edges with two site - tiles and two face - tiles , corresponding to adjacent sites and faces .",
    "the bond - tiles are open ( or closed ) independently , with the same probability @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) as the corresponding bonds .",
    "the site - tiles @xmath45 are then always open [ @xmath53 , while the face - tiles @xmath45 are always closed [ @xmath52 ] . with such construction ,",
    "no ambiguities arise , and at most three tiles can meet at a point .",
    "a possible construction for the bond percolation ( with octagons being the bond - tiles ) is illustrated in figure [ figsquare ] .     independently of others .",
    "right : representation by critical percolation on the bathroom tiling , with direction of original bonds marked on the corresponding octagonal tiles .",
    "rhombic tiles alternate in color , with blue ( always open ) corresponding to the sites of the original square lattice , while yellow ( always closed)to the faces .",
    "octagonal tiles correspond to the bonds , and are open or closed independently , with probabilities @xmath55 . ]    following the original motivation of broadbent and hammersley , we represent holes in some random porous medium by open tiles .",
    "a liquid is assumed to move freely through the holes , thus it can flow between two regions if there is a path of open tiles between them .",
    "more precisely , we say that there is an _ open _",
    "( _ closed _ ) _ crossing _ between two sets @xmath56 and @xmath57 inside the set @xmath58 , if for the percolation configuration restricted to @xmath58 , there is an open ( closed ) cluster intersecting both @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we will be mostly interested in crossings of quads ( @xmath4 topological quadrilaterals ) .",
    "note the following duality property : _ there is an open crossing between two opposite sides of a quad if and only if there is no dual _ ( _ i.e. _ , _ closed _ ) _ crossing between two other sides_. exchanging the notions of open and closed , we conclude that , on a given tiling , percolation models with probabilities @xmath47 and @xmath59 are dual to each other .",
    "in particular , the model with @xmath60 is self - dual , which can often be used to show that it is critical , like for the hexagonal lattice .",
    "the bathroom - tile model of the square lattice bond percolation in figure [ figsquare ] is dual to itself translated by one lattice step ( so that always open rhombi are shifted to always closed ones ) , which also leads to its criticality , @xcite .",
    "there are , however , dualities ( e.g. , arising from the star - triangle transformations ) with more complicated relations between  @xmath1 and @xmath61 , and so there are critical models with @xmath1 away from @xmath55 ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "though we have in mind critical models , we do not use criticality in the proof , rather some crossing estimates , which are a part of the russo ",
    "seymour  welsh theory .",
    "those also hold ( below any given scale ) for the near - critical models , like those discussed in @xcite . in a sense",
    "the estimates we need should hold whenever the crossing probabilities do not tend to a trivial limit ; see remark [ remrswnontriv ] .",
    "we work with a collection of percolation models @xmath62 ( and sometimes more general random colorings ) on tilings @xmath63 , indexed by a set @xmath64 ( e.g. , square lattices of different mesh ) , and denote by @xmath62 also the corresponding measure on percolation configurations ( @xmath4 random coloring of tiles ) .",
    "by @xmath65 , we will denote a `` scale parameter '' of the model @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that all tiles have diameter at most @xmath66 ( for a percolation on random tiling , our proof would work under the relaxed assumption that for any positive @xmath29 , the probability to find in a bounded region a tile of diameter bigger than  @xmath29 tends to zero as @xmath67 ) .",
    "this parameter also appears in the russo ",
    "welsh - type estimates below , which have to hold on scales larger than @xmath66 .",
    "note that in most models @xmath66 can be taken to be the supremum of tile diameters ( or the lattice mesh for the percolation on a lattice ) .",
    "we will be interested in scaling limits as the scale parameter tends to zero , looking at sequences of percolation models with @xmath67 , which do not degenerate in the limit .",
    "we will show in remark [ remseqnet ] , that in our setting working with sequences and nets yields the same results .",
    "as discussed above , all critical percolation models are conjectured to have a universal and conformally invariant scaling limit .",
    "moreover , its sle description allows to calculate exactly many scaling exponents and dimensions and we will use this conjectured picture in informal discussions below .",
    "however , to make our paper applicable to a wider class of models , we will work under much weaker assumptions .",
    "the famous russo  seymour  welsh theory provides universal bounds for crossing probabilities of the same shape , superimposed over lattices with different mesh .",
    "originally established for the critical bond percolation on the square lattice , it has been since generalized to many critical ( and near - critical , when the percolation probabilities tend to their critical values at appropriate speeds as the mesh tends to zero ) models with several different approaches ; see @xcite .",
    "we will use one of the recurrent techniques : conditioning on the lowest crossing . if a quad is crossed horizontally , one can select the lowest possible crossing ( the closest to the bottom side ) , which will then depend only on the configuration below . if we condition on the lowest crossing , the configuration above it is unbiased , allowing for easy estimates of events there .",
    "besides using this neat trick , we will assume certain bounds on the crossing probabilities for the annuli .",
    "a prominent role is played by the so - called _",
    "@xmath26-arm _ crossing events in annuli , since they control dimensions of several important sets .",
    "in particular , for a given percolation model @xmath62 we denote by @xmath68 the probability of a _ one - arm _ event , that _ there is an open crossing connecting two opposite circles of the annulus @xmath69_. then this is roughly the probability that the disc @xmath70 intersects an open cluster of size @xmath71 , which is expected for @xmath72 to have a power law like @xmath73 morally meaning ( modulo some correlation estimates ) that percolation clusters in the scaling limit have dimension @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , denote by @xmath75 the probability of a _ four - arm _",
    "event , that _ there are alternating open  closed  open ",
    "closed crossings connecting two opposite circles of the annulus @xmath69_. then this is roughly the probability that changing the percolation configuration on the disc @xmath70 changes the crossing events on the scale @xmath71 . indeed ,",
    "if all the tiles in @xmath70 are made open , that connects two open arms ; while making them closed connects two closed arms , destroying the open connection . for @xmath72 a power law @xmath76",
    "is expected , roughly meaning that the _ pivotal",
    "_ tiles ( such that altering their state changes crossing events on large scale ) have dimension @xmath77 in the scaling limit .",
    "whenever the rsw theory applies , the probabilities for @xmath26 arm events have power law bounds from above and below as @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , the probabilities are conjectured to satisfy universal ( independent of a particular percolation model ) power laws with rational powers , predicted by the conformal field theory ; see discussion in @xcite .",
    "those predictions have been so far proved for the critical site percolation on triangular lattice only @xcite , giving @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "other @xmath26-arm probabilities are also of interest , but estimating just the mentioned two allows to apply our methods . roughly speaking , we need to know that the percolation clusters have dimension smaller than @xmath80 and that pivotal points have dimension smaller than @xmath6 , or , in other words , that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "note that we do not actually need the power laws , but rather weaker versions of the corresponding upper estimates .",
    "namely , we need the following two estimates to hold _ uniformly _ for percolation models under consideration .",
    "[ assursw ] there exist positive functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 , such that @xmath85 and the following estimates hold whenever @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the probability of one open arm event and the probability of a similar event for one closed arm satisfy @xmath88 while the probability of a four arm event satisfies @xmath89    for @xmath90 , when the annulus is empty , we set @xmath91 , so that the function is defined for all positive arguments . without loss of generality , we can assume that functions @xmath92 are increasing in @xmath29 and decreasing in @xmath93 .    [ remsrsw ] for most percolation models where the rsw techniques work , their application would prove a stronger estimate , with @xmath83 replaced in ( [ eqwrsw ] ) by @xmath94 with @xmath81 .",
    "however , we can imagine situations where only our weaker version can a priori be established .",
    "[ remrswnontriv ] for most percolation models where the rsw techniques work , the estimate ( [ eqwrsw ] ) would be equivalent to saying that crossing probability for any given quad ( or for all quads ) is uniformly bounded away from @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "so morally our noise characterization would apply whenever one can speak of nontrivial subsequential scaling limits of crossing probabilities .",
    "the first assumption ( [ eqwrsw ] ) is used several times throughout the paper . in a stronger form ,",
    "it was one of the original russo ",
    "welsh results , and has since been shown to hold for a wide range of percolation models ; see @xcite . for site percolation on the triangular lattice",
    ", one can take @xmath95 ; see @xcite .",
    "the second assumption ( [ eqpivo ] ) is used only once , namely in the proof of theorem  [ tdiscrete ] .",
    "it is known [ in a sharp form with @xmath96 for site percolation on the triangular lattice ; see @xcite .",
    "christophe garban kindly allowed us to include as appendix [ appgarban ] his proof for bond percolation on the square lattice , which is partly inspired by the noise - sensitivity arguments in  @xcite .",
    "it seems possible to extend the proof to a wider range of percolation models ( by changing the values of the @xmath97 random variables so they become centered , rather than using symmetry arguments ) .",
    "[ qpivo ] for which models can ( [ eqpivo ] ) be proved ? can it be deduced from ( [ eqwrsw ] ) ? is there a geometric argument ?",
    "summing up the discussion above , we study collections of percolation models satisfying assumptions [ assursw ] . in particular , _",
    "our results apply to critical and near - critical site percolation on the triangular lattice and bond percolation on the square lattice_.      every discrete percolation configuration ( or a coloring of a tiling ) is clearly described by the collection of quads ( @xmath4 topological quadrilaterals ) which it crosses ( and for a fixed lattice mesh in a bounded domain a finite collection of quads would suffice ) .",
    "we introduce a setup , which allows to work independently of the lattice mesh and pass to the scaling limit , but the idea remains the same : a percolation configuration is encoded by a collection of quads  those which are crossed by clusters .",
    "our setup is inspired by the dedekind s sections and uses the metric and ordering on the space of quads .",
    "the ordering comes from the obvious observation that crossing of a quad automatically contains crossings of `` shorter '' sub - quads , and so possible percolation configurations ( @xmath4 quad collections ) should satisfy certain monotonicity properties .",
    "we will work in a domain @xmath98 .",
    "quad _ in @xmath37 is a topological quadrilateral , that is , a homeomorphism @xmath99 ^ 2 \\to q([0,1]^2)\\subset d$ ] .",
    "we introduce some redundancy when considering quads as parameterized quadrilaterals , but we avoid certain technicalities .",
    "the space of all such quads will be denoted by @xmath100 .",

    "setting there is no difference between connected and path - connected crossings , but one can imagine lattice models where the probabilities of the two would be different in the scaling limit .",
    "however , for the models under consideration , every crossing in the scaling limit almost surely can be realized by a hlder continuous curve @xcite , so the two notions are essentially the same .",

    "such a procedure would give a very short proof of the uniqueness of the full percolation scaling limit , provide an elegant setup for the renormalization theory of percolation crossings , and show that the `` finite model '' discussed by langlands and lafortune in  @xcite indeed approximates the critical percolation .",
