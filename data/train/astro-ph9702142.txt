    "hickson groups are among the densest galaxy systems in the universe , with apparent surface density enhancements that range from 300 to 2000 ( sulentic 1987 ) .",
    "they are defined by the number of members , ( n @xmath0 4 ) , compactness and isolation degree ( hickson 1982 , 1993 ) .",
    "the original subsample has been enlarged in the southern sky by means of an automated search by prandoni et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and relaxing hickson criteria ( tassi & iovino , 1995 ) .",
    "the small number of members in hickson groups allows a detailed study of individual galaxies .",
    "in addition , and contrary to other compact groups such as those of shakbazyan ( del olmo , moles & perea , 1995 ) , hickson groups exhibit a wide range of morphologies and degrees of interaction .",
    "this variety is quite different from that of other high density regions such as the centers of rich clusters .",
    "their high surface density enhancements , together with low velocity dispersions ( @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3@xmath4 = 200 , @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3@xmath5 = 330 hickson et al .",
    "1992 ) , argue that the groups are physical but with short dynamical lifetimes ( @xmath6 yrs ) .",
    "the number of merger candidates , however , appears to be extremely low ( zepf et al .",
    "1991 ; moles et al .",
    "1994 ) and , although star formation is enhanced with respect to isolated galaxies , it is lower than in strongly interacting pairs ( moles et al . 1994 ; sulentic & rabaca 1994 ) . a diffuse medium surrounding entire groups has been detected as atomic gas ( williams & van gorkom 1995 , and references therein ) , x - ray emission ( bahcall et al .",

    "; sulentic 1987 , and references therein ) .",
    "the study of hickson group environments shows that some of them are embedded in more extended physical systems ( ramella et al .",
    "1994 ; rood & struble 1994 ) , but with low densities and in general well isolated ( sulentic 1987 ; rood & williams 1989 ) .",
    "different models have been proposed in order to explain the nature of hickson groups .",
    "mamon ( 1986 , 1995 ) suggested that 50% of the groups are chance superposition of pairs and unrelated galaxies within loose groups .",
    "hernquist et al .",
    "( 1995 ) interpret them as end - on views of filaments of galaxies .",
    "in the context of the last model , and based on x - ray results by mulchaey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , ostriker et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest that low spiral fraction groups are real physical entities , but high spiral fraction groups are projected filaments .",
    "the application of their @xmath7 parameter to hickson groups has been found however inappropriate by pildis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) because the groups are gas poor .",
    "dellantonio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have also argued that the large axial ratios inferred by ostriker et al .",
    "( 1995 ) could be just a reflection of the difference in gas fraction between groups and the reference rich clusters .",
    "diaferio et al .",
    "( 1994 ) proposed that compact groups could continually form in rich groups , while athanassoula et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that , if they have a sufficiently massive and not too centrally concentrated common dark halo , and/or appropriate initial kinematics , their lifetimes should be considerably longer than would be naively expected .",
    "since no significant enhancement in the sfr is observed nor many candidates for mergers of late types galaxies , the effects of the environment on the gaseous and stellar component of hickson groups could appear only at faint levels in which case detailed observations should be needed to reveal them . in order to bring new elements to this debate we will discuss here one hickson compact group with a high spiral fraction , hickson 96 .    our aim is to look for optical signatures of interactions by studying the dynamics of the interaction - both in terms of the overall appearance of the group and the local effects on member galaxies - and the possible perturbations of the star formation activity .",

    "the bar in the center of ngc 7674 can be seen clearly in that image , as well as the beginning of both spiral arms .",

    "the gas seems to be perturbed in the outer parts , mostly toward h96c , where it shows increasing velocities .",
    "this area corresponds to the area where one of the arms gets disrupted .",
    "the rotation curve also shows several minima and maxima that correspond to the morphological structure of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , the position of the minima at 15 , 7 and 6 from the kinematical center ( fig .",

    "( 1987 ; pa = 113@xmath19 and 23@xmath19 ) , we find that the kinematic axis of the galaxy must lie around a pa of 121@xmath19 .",

    "a bar could also be present , as suggested by the elongated structure seen in the sharpened image shown in fig .",
    "7c , but the high inclination of the galaxy together with its small size do not allow a sure identification .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of h96c in the three filters are shown in fig .",
    "the galaxy shows an excess of light produced by its spiral structure in an intermediate region ( 2 r@xmath30 4 ) and , although the bulge and disk can be clearly noticed in the profile , a reliable quantitative decomposition is not possible due its high inclination .",
    "colour index profiles ( fig .",
    "6b ) have been obtained as for h96a , with the deprojection parameters given below .",
    "h96c shows a rather steep colour index gradient , becoming bluer at larger radii .",
    "in addition it has perturbed outer isophotes and two bluer protuberances are noted towards the direction opposite to h96a .",
    "their colour indices are slightly bluer ( ( b - v)@xmath47 , ( v - r)@xmath48 ) than those of the disk ( ( b - v)@xmath49 , ( v - r)@xmath50 ) .",
    "both the protuberances and the spiral structure of h96c make it difficult to determine accurately the isophote centers .",
    "however we have found no important isophotal off - centering either before the beginning of the spiral arms at re @xmath22 17 , or for the outer isophotes free from perturbations ( 4 r@xmath30 6 ) . for larger radii the proximity of h96a prevents a fit .",

    "this shows the existence of an important bulge in the inner parts as expected for an early - type spiral and a possible hint of the presence of a central bar .",
    "we have used the outer unperturbed isophotes for the calculation of the deprojection parameters of h96c , obtaining an inclination of 52@xmath19 and a pa of 33@xmath19 .",
    "the spectrum of the galaxy shows prominent absorption bands and lines , typical of an old stellar population with a large break at 4000 . following the indices by pickles ( 1985 ) the galaxy has a spectral type between g0 and g8 and over - solar metallicity .",
    "overlapped to the old stellar population the galaxy shows emission lines indicating that a burst of star formation is occurring as found by laurikainen & moles ( 1988 ) .",
    "the emission lines like h@xmath20 and [ nii ] extend for about 6 kpc . in fig .",
    "8b we show the rotation curve obtained with the high resolution spectrum by using h@xmath20 , [ nii ] and [ sii ] lines .",
    "the direction of the slit was that of the line connecting the centers of h96a and h96c .",
    "the kinematical and geometrical centers are basically coincident within our spatial resolution .",
    "in fact , as can be seen when we symmetrize the curve , the section of maximum emission is located at 05 from the kinematical center .",
    "the curve is symmetric in the central parts , but some perturbations seem to occur for the outer ones .",
    "the relative velocities remain constant toward h96a , while they might decrease toward the opposite direction .",
    "the change in velocity , however , is within the error bars .",
    "the deprojected semi - amplitude of the velocity curve is 317 .",
    "the galaxy h96b ( ngc  7675 ) , an early type object , is the second brightest galaxy in the group , and its center is located 23 to the se away from the center of h96a . in fig .",
    "9a we show the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles obtained for the three photometric filters .",
    "the profiles of the outer regions are well fitted by a  law .",

    "we performed a quantitative analysis of the shape of the galaxy by least squares fitting of a set of isophotes to ellipses following the well known method proposed by carter ( 1978 ) and widely applied by bender et al .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "9d , where we plot the axial ratio as a function of the semimajor axis .",
    "excluding radii smaller than 12 , where the ellipticity is dominated by the seeing , there is a region between @xmath55 = 12 and 6 where @xmath56 is nearly constant in all three filters with a value of @xmath57 .",
    "this region has a larger ellipticity than the rest of the galaxy , and is also the same region where the residuals with respect to the  become more significant .",
    "this is opposite to the seeing effect , which makes constant ellipticity isophotes to appear rounder toward the center .",
    "then an abrupt variation to rounder isophotes ( @xmath58 ) is seen from 6 to 12 , to reach an almost constant value of @xmath59 at about 16  from the center .",
    "all the isophotes are concentric for all filters .",
    "their position angle is nearly constant at pa@xmath60 for the inner 20  and decreases to  46at 30 .",
    "its determination , however , becomes less accurate with increasing radius since the ellipticity is lower in the outer regions .",
    "the same applies when determining the fourth coefficient of the cosine term , a@xmath61 , in the fourier analysis of the residuals with respect to ellipses .",
    "caon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) determined that @xmath62 is necessary in order to obtain significant values for a@xmath61 . in our case",
    "it was only possible to determine a@xmath61 out to 15  from the center .",
    "we do not detect any significant trend until 5 , and only in the region where @xmath56 changes rapidly is it noted that a@xmath61 becomes positive . for larger distances , however , this coefficient is not statistically significant in the fourier expansion .",
    "we have further analyzed the morphology of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "10a ) in two other ways . the first method was to smooth the image by filtering by a running median box of 3  of side , and to subtract the result from the original image ( fig .",
    "the second approach was to subtract a model of a seeing convolved  galaxy ( fig .",
    "10c ) with the parameters obtained from the external isophotes of the original galaxy , i.e. @xmath63 and pa@xmath60 . the subtraction is shown in fig . 10d . in both cases there",
    "exist significant residuals in the central part of the galaxy , where we see a structure of 75@xmath133  in size plus some residuals for the central 10 , while the outer part of the galaxy vanishes , since it is well represented by a  law .",
    "this inner feature is detected in the three filters .",
    "a faint plume also appears when we analyze the median smoothed v image that is displayed in fig .",
    "it is also seen in the b and r filters .",
    "another deep image of the group , but with a larger field of view , would be needed to characterize its properties , in particular its extension and colour indexes . a second tidal feature , a bridge of optical light , is also visible in the same image , joining h96b to h96d .",
    "it is also detected in the b image , and more strongly in the r image .",
    "the spectra of the galaxy show only absorption lines with no signature of recent star formation .",
    "the velocities and velocity dispersion along the major and minor axes of h96b , were obtained by the tonry & davies ( 1979 ) method .",
    "the velocity , velocity dispersion and their errors were determined by cross ",
    "correlation of the spectra in each spatial section with those of 15 template stars .",
    "the final values for each spatial section were then obtained by weighting by the errors . in fig .",
    "11a and 11b we present the velocity curve along the slit for the major and minor axes respectively . for the minor axis , the radial scale was divided by the axial ratio in order to compare directly with the curve obtained along the major axis .",
    "the error bars in the figure correspond to the mean quadratic error for each point . as can be seen from the figure a rotation",
    "is observed in the major axis for the central 10  where the s / n is high , and it amounts to 30 - 40 .",
    "the velocity curve is perturbed in the minor axis direction , being decoupled from the rest of the galaxy for the region within 6  from the center .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles along the principal axes are shown in fig .",
    "11c , where the distance scale along the minor axis has been corrected as before .",
    "the agreement between the two axes has to be emphasized . in the central region",
    "the velocity dispersion may be considered roughly constant with a value of @xmath64 , but some structure appears .",
    "then the velocity dispersion falls to about @xmath65 at a radius of 4  and seems to increase again in the outer parts starting from a radius of 6  from the center .",
    "the global behavior of the velocity dispersion profile , as well as the structure seen at the inner parts , seem to be real since they appear in the two axes and in spectra which were obtained in different conditions .",
    "this galaxy , the bluest of all in the group ( ( b - v)@xmath34 = 0.17 , ( v - r)@xmath34 = 0.40 ) , was previously classified as an irregular i m because only the knotty inner part was detected .",
    "however the outer isophotes that we detect here look quite symmetric and in fact the data are consistent with a late type spiral with an exponential disk . in fig .",
    "5c we present the surface brightness profiles in the three filters , and as it can clearly be seen from the figure , they agree well with an exponential disk with some perturbations due to the knots which are observable on the images . assuming that the external isophotes correspond to an intrinsically circular disk we obtain for the position angle and inclination respectively 10@xmath19 and 54@xmath19 .    in fig .",

    "all of this indicates a very blue galaxy with a population of young stars .",
    "the redder colours of knots b and c and even more so of knot a are the consequence of the presence of very intense emission lines that contribute to the red part of the spectrum , reflecting a very recent burst of star formation .",
    "for this galaxy we have two low resolution spectra at pa = 88@xmath19 and 161@xmath19 . in the first case the slit passes through knots",
    "b and c , but it was taken under bad weather conditions .",
    "for the second , the slit goes through the disk and covers basically the b and c knots and part of a. since it was taken under not very good seeing it was not possible to spatially resolve the different regions . to derive physical parameters we added all the spatial sections along the slit . in this case",
    "we note the presence of a faint stellar continuum ( fig .",
    "the spectrum also shows a depression to the red of h@xmath71 due to a weak g  band .",
    "since the 4000  break is not clearly visible , the underlying dominant stellar population is earlier than g. this result is also supported by the presence of absorption for the hydrogen lines until h@xmath71 .    over the stellar continuum we see emission lines of [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] and the balmer lines h@xmath71 , h@xmath72 and h@xmath20 . in table 4",
    "we give the observed and de - reddened intensities of the lines .",
    "the values and the non existence of the [ oi]6300  line show that the gas is emitted by classical hii regions with a thermal origin .",
    "the value of 1.34 for the ratio of the [ sii ] lines corresponds to a density of 100 @xmath73 . by using the empirical relations by pagel et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and the curves by edmunds & pagel ( 1984 ) we found t@xmath30 10500 @xmath18 1500k and an abundance 1/3 solar . from these values",
    "we have calculated the absolute flux of the h@xmath72 continuum i@xmath74 = 5.62@xmath1310@xmath75 ergs@xmath15@xmath46a@xmath15 . for the adopted distance",
    "the total flux emitted by both knots b and c is 3.6@xmath1310@xmath76ergs@xmath15 and the lyman photon flux is 6.7@xmath13 10@xmath77phs@xmath15 .",
    "given the low value for the equivalent width for h@xmath72 , the observed star formation should have happened in a burst about 8 @xmath13 10@xmath78 yrs ago .",
    "the effective temperature for the stars of the burst is @xmath22 30000 k , corresponding to the t@xmath79 of b0 .",
    "these results indicate an important stellar formation in h96d .",
    "the condensations may represent different bursts of induced star formation that took place in this dwarf galaxy .",
    "we have shown that the geometrical center of the h96a disk is shifted by 5  relative to the photometric center , in the direction opposite to h96c and perpendicular to the observed bar .",
    "one of the two arms of h96a vanishes in its outer parts , and the same occurs for h96c , both in the area where their disks overlap .",
    "an offset of the h96c disk would be difficult to detect due to the small size of this galaxy .",
    "galaxies whose centers of the disk are offset from the center of the bar are not a rare case , and the asymmetry is more important for the later hubble types , being often associated to one - armed spiral structures ( see review by odewah , 1996 ) .",
    "their origin is not well understood .",
    "impact with a companion can produce them , as shown by athanassoula ( 1996 ) with the help of numerical simulations , but other mechanism should exist since isolated asymmetric galaxies have been found ( e.g. phookun et al . 1993 ) . in the case of h96a and c , the interaction hypothesis seems plausible , since both galaxies are bi - symmetrical in their inner parts , while they loose their symmetry in the area where their disks are in contact .",
    "it is also there where the tails start .",
    "h96b could , at a first glance , appear unaffected by the other members of the group .",
    "we have , however , shown that this elliptical galaxy has clear morphological and kinematical perturbations .",
    "its surface brightness profile , while well represented by a r@xmath27 law in the outer parts , deviates from it in a sinusoidal way with the highest excess of light in the inner 10  ( @xmath22 4 kpc ) . for the same inner radii",
    "the ellipticity of the isophotes suffers an important increase relative to the outer parts .",
    "these results , together with the kinematical perturbations found for the same range of radii , clearly suggest the presence of a very elongated component in the center of h96b , kinematically decoupled relative to the overall velocity pattern of the galaxy .",
    "these properties have been observed in other elliptical galaxies .",
    "nieto et al . (",
    "1991 ) found that all ellipticals in his sample with decoupled cores ( 33% ) show photometric structures in a similar range of radii .",
    "forbes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest from their observations that kinematically - distinct cores show disk - like shapes , although the presence of dust and/or low inclinations of the disk can make the detection of those disks difficult ( forbes et al .",
    "1995 ; kormendy et al .",
    "this might be the case for h96b , for which we find indications of a small  scale elongated dust lane towards the center ( @xmath83.4 . ) .",
    "in fact higher ellipticities of the central isophotes , as we have measured in h96b , have been attributed in the literature to evidences of disks ( franx & illingworth , 1988 ; forbes 1994 ; forbes et al .",
    "1995 ) finding in some cases bar - like structures ( surma & bender 1995 ) .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the origin of these kind of features , and we examine here whether they may apply to h96b .",
    "kormendy ( 1984 ) and more recently balcells & quinn ( 1990 ) explain decoupled cores by the capture of a small spherical / compact galaxy . since h96b is found in a group with likely existence of dwarf galaxies , it seems reasonable that this giant elliptical had previously swallowed a smaller companion causing the observed kinematical perturbations , and the observed wave  like perturbation of its light profile .",
    "the recent model by hau & thomson ( 1994 ) explains these signatures through a retrograde interaction with a secondary galaxy without invoking a merger .",
    "a completely different approach is the streaming motion model by statler ( 1991 ) which does not consider an external origin . in the case of h96b",
    "the merger / interaction models are also favoured by its broad and diffuse tidal - like structure , that has been predicted by simulations as an interaction signature ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 and references therein ) and photometrically described by schombert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "it is difficult to establish the existence of peculiarities in h96d due to its small size , that usually implies a barely defined shape . as shown in @xmath83.5",
    ", it is a disk system , probably a sm galaxy , showing knots related to the presence of bursts of star formation .",
    "this young population still keeping ionized gas is mainly distributed in the side closer to h96a , and might be therefore induced by this galaxy .",
    "in fact , the knotty aspect of h96d is quite similar to that of ic 5283 , for which the existence of local episodes of star formation processes , induced by the interaction with the companion galaxy ngc 7469 , has been claimed to explain its morphology ( mrquez & moles 1994 ) .",
    "the morphological and kinematical perturbations of the galaxies in hickson groups strengthen the argument that they are real entities , and help to define their dynamical state .",
    "hickson ( 1990 ) estimates that one third of the galaxies in hickson groups show morphological disturbances , and one third of all groups contain at least 3 morphologically disturbed galaxies .",
    "the ratio of perturbed galaxies is larger ( 2/3 ) on the basis of spectroscopic data ( rubin , hunter & ford 1991 ) .",
    "tikhonov ( 1990 ) suggests that 53% of the groups he observed show clear signs of interactions , but the majority being in pairs ( 64% ) .",
    "deeper observations of compact groups however should change these ratios .",
    "hickson 96 is an example of a group with an evident interacting pair of galaxies but , as we conclude from our observations , not only the pair but all of its members are suffering the effects of gravitational interaction .",
    "toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) showed that tails , bridges or plumes are signs of gravitational interaction . in hickson 96",
    "two long tails emerge from the region between the spiral galaxies a and c , while a plume comes out from the elliptical b which in turn is connected with the dwarf disk galaxy d through a bridge of matter ( fig .",
    "the existence of these features argues very strongly for the fact that hickson 96 is a physical interacting group .",
    "those features fit well with the extensive photometric study of tidal features in interacting galaxies performed by schombert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , which indicates that the internal velocity dispersion of the galaxy from where the material originates strongly influences the appearance of the tidal feature .",
    "sharp features are more abundant in spiral systems , while broad , diffuse features are more likely associated to hot components , as is here the case .    a diffuse intragroup component has been detected at different wavelengths toward several hickson groups ( see @xmath81 ) .",
    "we have not detected diffuse light toward hickson 96 in the b , v and r bands at 3@xmath2 levels of 27.2 mag arcsec@xmath80 , 27.1 mag arcsec@xmath80 , and 26.9 mag arcsec@xmath80 respectively .",
    "neither has diffuse x - ray emission associated to the group been reported , although it has been observed with the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) with an exposure time of 3800s .",
    "this , however , can not exclude the existence of such emission since simulations made by diaferio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) indicate that a time longer than 10@xmath81s would be necessary in order to detect hot intragroup gas .",
    "x - ray emission has been only detected toward h96a ( ngc 7674 ) , probably originated from its seyfert nucleus , similarly to x - ray detections of active galaxies in h4 , h16 , h44 and h91 ( ebeling et al .",
    "1994 , saracco & ciliegi 1995 , pildis et al .",
    "dynamical evolution would be however expected to occur , since the material being ejected from the individual galaxies as tidal features into the intragroup medium could build a diffuse light component in the future evolution of hickson 96",
    ".    the observed harmonic radius amounts to @xmath82 kpc .",
    "this value , together with the velocity dispersion obtained in @xmath83.1 , implies a virial mass of @xmath83 = 1.7@xmath13 10@xmath84  and a crossing time of @xmath85h@xmath86 .",
    "the group luminosity , obtained as the sum of the light of the individual galaxies extrapolated to infinite , is l@xmath87 7 @xmath13 10@xmath43  which correspond to the rather low value for the mass luminosity ratio of 20/. the low velocity dispersion and crossing time contradicts in the case of hickson 96 the argument that groups are chance superposition of pairs and non related galaxies within loose groups .",
    "from the point of view of isolation hickson 96 is a well isolated group since it is not part of any loose group or cluster and only two galaxies fainter than h96a and b can be found in a radius of 1 mpc and with a difference in velocity smaller than 1500  ( @xmath83.1 ) .",
    "we present here evidence that hickson 96 is a dynamical entity .",
    "tidal features associated to all of its members , a small velocity dispersion ( 160 ) , together with its high degree of isolation argue very strongly against alternatives for the origin of hickson 96 such as a transient group in a loose one or chance projections .",
    "therefore we conclude that the most probable alternative is that hickson 96 is a real compact group , where the observed features can be accounted for by multiple tidal interactions in a dense environment such as that of compact groups .",

    "<S> we analyze the morphology and dynamics of the galaxies of the hickson 96 compact group by means of deep ccd images in the b , v and r photometric bands and long  slit spectroscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> the four galaxies of this spiral rich group show signs of gravitational interaction . </S>",
    "<S> two long tails come out from the contact region of the close pair h96ac . </S>",
    "<S> it is also there where both galaxies , bi - symmetrical in their inner parts , loose one of their arms . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , both the photometric and kinematical center of h96a are displaced relative to the center of the disk .    </S>",
    "<S> h96b , a giant elliptical galaxy , shows significant deviations from a law at the inner parts and small rotation along its major axis . </S>",
    "<S> we find at the centre of the galaxy an elongated component which is kinematically decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> a wide faint plume seems to emerge from this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> h96d , the smallest galaxy of the group , seems to be influenced by the bigger members , as indicated by three prominent knots of recent bursts of star formation in its blue disk , and by hints of optical bridges joining h96d with h96a and b.    finally the group has a low velocity dispersion ( 160 ) and is well isolated - no galaxies with comparable magnitude to h96a or h96b are found in its neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> all these results lead us to conclude that hickson 96 constitutes a real physical system . </S>"
