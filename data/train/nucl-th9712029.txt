    "the scalar resonance @xmath0 which has been discovered at lear by the crystal barrel collaboration in the reaction @xmath4 ( at rest ) @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite , was immediately considered as a good candidate for the scalar glueball .",
    "indeed , the observed mass ( ( 1520@xmath725 ) mev in @xcite and ( 1545@xmath725 ) mev in @xcite ) was near the value predicted by the lattice - qcd calculations @xcite of that time .",
    "it is also in agreement with the analysis of recent data on the decay @xmath8 @xcite which however requires a mixture between the glueball and the neighbouring @xmath9 states @xcite .",
    "another signal that strengthens this identification lies in the fact that , in the radiative decay @xmath10 , a sharp peak is seen in the 4@xmath11 spectrum , having quantum numbers @xmath12 and mass and width also compatible with @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "the trace anomaly of qcd is modelized using a scalar dilaton field @xmath26 that is intimately related to the gluon condensate @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42 since we are only interested in the scalar sector , the axial anomaly which would give the @xmath43-@xmath43 mass difference is not considered here .",
    "our model contains six parameters : the current quark masses ( @xmath44 ) , the strengths ( @xmath45 ) , the gluon parameter @xmath46 and the cut - off @xmath47 introduced to regularize the diverging quark loop .",
    "four of these parameters are adjusted to reproduce the pion mass ( @xmath48 ) , the weak pion decay constant ( @xmath49 ) , the kaon mass ( @xmath50 ) and that of @xmath16(1500 ) .",
    "we then have two free parameters that we choose to be the vacuum gluon condensate @xmath27 ( related to @xmath51 @xcite ) and the constituent up quark mass @xmath52 .",
    "the latter is connected to the strength @xmath53 using the usual gap equation @xcite which minimizes the action .",
