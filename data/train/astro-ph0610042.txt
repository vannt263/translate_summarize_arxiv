    "the connection between accretion flow parameters and radio jet power is mysterious .",
    "most quasars are radio quiet , however @xmath9 of optically selected quasars are radio loud and more importantly about @xmath10 of quasars have powerful frii radio lobes @xcite .",
    "the lobe emission is the signature that the time averaged jet kinetic luminosity , @xmath5 , is enormous , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is not known how powerful the quasar jet can be relative to the thermal luminosity from accretion , @xmath1 .",
    "understanding the limits of jet power can help reveal the physical nature of the quasar central engine .",
    "the primary obstacle in this exercise is that in order for @xmath1 and @xmath0 to be estimated contemporaneously necessitates that @xmath4 be derived from parsec scale radio jet observations and such efforts are plagued by poorly estimated doppler enhancement factors ( raised to the fourth power ) and the results are often grossly inaccurate @xcite .",
    "for example , the estimates of blazar jet power in @xcite indicate that @xmath12 agn are fairly common , but the results are skewed by poorly constrained doppler factors @xcite . alternatively , the time averaged jet power @xmath5 can be estimated far more accurately from the isotropic properties of the extended emission .",
    "some @xmath13 sources were found in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath5 estimate is not contemporaneous with the @xmath1 data , so one can not say if the sources presently satisfy or ever satisfied @xmath7 .",
    "grossly inaccurate measurements of @xmath0 are really of no value , so we must concentrate on the @xmath5 estimates and combine this with other information in order to establish a class of @xmath7 sources . in section 3 , a subsample of 10 fr ii agn with @xmath14 , is argued to be comprised of @xmath7 sources .",
    "in this section , we review the standard estimation techniques used in the following analysis .",
    "the more information that is known about the large scale radio structure such as the radio spectral index across the lobe and high resolution x - ray contours , the more sophisticated and presumably more accurate an estimate that can be obtained for the energy flux delivered to the lobes from the jet @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such detailed information does not exist for most radio sources and we need an expedience that is helpful for studying large samples . such a method that allows one to convert 151 mhz flux densities , @xmath15 ( measured in jy ) , into estimates of @xmath5 ( measured in ergs / s ) , was developed in @xcite , the result is captured by the formula derived in @xcite : @xmath16^{\\frac{6}{7}}\\mathrm{ergs / sec}\\;,\\\\ & & z \\equiv 3.31-(3.65)\\times\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left[x^{4}-0.203x^{3}+0.749x^{2 } + 0.444x+0.205\\right]^{-0.125}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath15 is the total optically thin flux density from the lobes ( i.e. , * contributions from doppler boosted jets or radio cores are removed * ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath18=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we define the radio spectral index , @xmath21 , as @xmath22 .",
    "the formula is most accurate for large classical double radio sources , thus we do not consider sources with a linear size of less than 20 kpc . alternatively , one can also use the independently derived isotropic estimator from @xcite @xmath23    even though one can use the jet emission from the parsec scale radio core to estimate , @xmath0 more contemporaneously with the accretion flow emission as in @xcite , such estimates are prone to be very inaccurate .",
    "one is observing a very small amount of `` waste energy '' such as x - ray or optical emission as the powerful radio jet propagates away from the source .",
    "one must then try to figure out the fraction of @xmath0 that is converted to waste energy in this region .",
    "typically , the x - ray , radio and optical regions are observed with different spatial resolution , so it is unclear if one is detecting the same physical region on parsec scales as one synthesizes the broad band data . in cases",
    "in which there is sufficient broad band flux to make an estimate , one is plagued with the further ambiguity of determining the doppler factor of the relativistic jet .",
    "this is a critical obstacle because the luminosity from an unresolved region scales with the doppler factor to the fourth power @xcite .",
    "more shortcomings of this method are discussed in @xcite and a published example in which the @xmath0 is apparently miscalculated using radio core properties by three orders of magnitude is discussed explicitly .",
    "thus , the most accurate estimates of @xmath0 should use an isotropic estimator such as the radio lobe flux in ( 1 ) , even though it is just a time average .",
    "the total bolometric luminosity of the accretion flow , @xmath1 , is the thermal emission from the accretion flow ( ir to x - ray ) , including any radiation in broad emission lines .",
    "to estimate , @xmath1 , we use the composite sed in table 2 of @xcite , which see for details .",
    "this spectrum , in combination with the broad emission lines , represents the `` typical '' radiative signature of a strong accretion flow onto a black hole .",
    "this signature is empirical and it is independent of all theoretical models of the accretion flow .",
    "if @xmath24 is the observed spectral luminosity at the quasar rest frame frequency , @xmath25 , then @xmath1 is estimated as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spectral luminosity from the composite sed .",
    "finally , we list the equations used to estimate the central black hole mass , @xmath28 .",
    "the reader should consult the references for details .",

    "table 1 is comprised of @xmath31 qsos that were found by cross - correlating all existing vla , merlin and atca radio maps with the absolute visual magnitudes and broad line widths of the qsos in @xcite .",
    "sources that were discovered by this method with @xmath32 were previously reported in @xcite , which see for more details on the sample selection .",
    "a more in depth analysis showed that 3c 216 and 3c 455 also belong in the table .",
    "however , as mentioned previously , due to the lack of simultaneity between jet ejection and uv emission , the @xcite sample does not establish the @xmath7 condition . in subsection ( 3.1 )",
    "it is argued that the @xmath33 jets in table 1 satisfy @xmath7 , for some @xmath3 .",
    "the first column is the source name followed by the redshift .",
    "column 3 has two estimates of @xmath5 from ( 1 ) on the left and ( 3 ) on the right , separated by a slash .",
    "column 4 is @xmath1 estimated from ( 4 ) at the rest frame frequency in column 6 .",
    "column 5 is @xmath34 .",
    "the last three columns are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the references .",
    "if more than one observed frequency was available , a second estimate for @xmath1 was provided for that source so that one can assess the error in using a composite sed to approximate @xmath1 .",
    "the qso , 3c 455 , requires some elaboration .",
    "this object has a narrow h@xmath29 ( fwhm = 620 km / s ) , yet the nuclear luminosity is far stronger than a narrow line radio galaxy and its magnitude is more typical of a strong seyfert 1 galaxy , hence its historical classification as a quasar @xcite .",
    "implicit in the first estimate in table 1 is that the object is a narrow line seyfert 1 , but h@xmath29 appears weak compared to [ oiii]@xmath37 ( h@xmath29/[oiii]=0.2 and h@xmath29/[oiii]@xmath38 in narrow line seyfert1 s ) because the narrow line region is greatly enhanced by emission line gas that is excited by the jet and is aligned with the radio structure @xcite . in support of this interpretation , there is an elongated patch of diffuse emission enveloping the kpc radio jet axis between the two lowest contours of the hst image in @xcite with a flux approximately equal to the narrow line flux in the f702w filter @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can interpret the object as a narrow line radio galaxy and @xmath28 can be estimated from the galactic host bulge luminosity .",
    "there are a variety of fits to the @xmath28 - host bulge luminosity relation , but the fits of @xcite offer the smallest scatter since they are based on large samples .",
    "the relation that is most relevant is the best fit estimator derived from 72 agn in table 3 of @xcite , @xmath39 thus , we need to find @xmath40 for the galactic bulge in order to utilize ( 8) .",
    "the hst image is taken with the f702w filter and the apparent magnitude of the galactic bulge ( after subtraction of the nuclear core and extended narrow line flux ) is @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 magnitudes are approximately the cousins r magnitudes .",
    "the transformation to the cousins r magnitude along with the k - correction that is given in @xcite yields @xmath43 and from ( 8) , @xmath44 .",
    "this is the basis for the second estimate in table 1 .",
    "a value of @xmath45 suggests that even if the jet central engine is currently in a low state then at some epoch during the lifetime of the source it must have had @xmath7 .",
    "for example , if pks 1018 - 42 is not now nor has ever been kinetically dominated then the on average @xmath46 for the lifetime of the source . however , since @xmath47 , the peak values of the instantaneous @xmath4 , @xmath48>1.45 l_{edd}$ ] .",
    "thus , one expects that @xmath49 $ ] would have to exceed @xmath50 by a significant amount at certain epochs in order for the pks 1018 - 42 to have always been in an @xmath51 state .",
    "this is inconsistent with the magnitudes of the peaks in the duty cycle of quasar @xmath52 based on our current knowledge , see @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the estimates of 268 agn in @xcite utilized the same estimators , eqns .",
    "( 5)-(7 ) , used here and @xmath53 for all the broad line agn .",
    "furthermore , note that most of the qsos in table 1 have prodigious accretion rates and @xmath54 is not a consequence of the quasars being in a state of suppressed accretion .",
    "the most likely explanation of the data in table 1 is that these sources experienced epochs in which @xmath55 as opposed to the alternative explanation that the broad line sources had protracted phases in which @xmath56 .",
    "since the data set is small , the analysis of the data is particularly sensitive to the integrity of the estimates in table 1 .",
    "the main drawback to the argument above is that the estimates of @xmath28 could be off by a large amount in an individual object , @xcite , and these sources appear to have @xmath45 merely as a result of these errors .",
    "if this were the fundamental explanation of the @xmath45 estimates then a statistical anomaly must also present , the @xmath57 qsos just below the threshold of table 1 never have @xmath28 over estimated ( i.e. there are no false negatives for the criteria @xmath45 ) . in subsection 3.2.3 , it is shown that this anomalous requirement conflicts with the data used to create the virial mass estimates .",
    "furthermore , there could also be errors of smaller magnitude associated with the estimates of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the possibility of these types of errors in table 1 is dealt with by introducing as many different sets of observational data as possible in order to obtain independent estimates of the same quantities .",
    "thus , any results that are way `` out of family '' like @xmath58 for 3c 455 can be flagged as unreliable . in order to expose the largest potential source of error , @xmath28 ,",
    "is computed from as many different spectral bands and emission lines as possible ( generally two entries in table 1 ) .",
    "similarly , we compute @xmath5 from two different estimators .",
    "furthermore , we estimate all potentially reddened qsos by finding an ir flux estimate to reveal hidden agn uv luminosity ( this will affect ( 5)-(7 ) ) . for example , 3c 190 fails to meet the @xmath45 criteria because it has considerable hidden agn uv emission , see table 3 of @xcite .",
    "the errors might still persist and the potential effects are discussed in the following two subsections .",
    "for the 3crr qsos @xmath59 kpc in linear extent .",
    "the center of each bin is indicated on the horizontal axis .",
    "all of the sources in the two bin on the far right satisfy @xmath45 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath60,width=85 ]      one way to assess the role of the statistical scatter in the estimators is to study the complete 3crr sample .",
    "we estimated @xmath36 for every qso @xmath61 kpc ( remember , ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are not accurate for linear sizes less than 20 kpc ) .",
    "figure 1 is a histogram of the distribution of @xmath62 .",
    "every effort was made to average away errant estimates .",
    "every available broad line fwhm , @xcite , and continuum flux density , @xcite , was gathered for each source from the literature and every combination of these was used to estimate numerous values of @xmath28 from ( 5)-(7 ) .",
    "these values were then averaged for each source . this average @xmath28 and the average @xmath5 from ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) were used to compute the `` best estimate '' of @xmath36 for each source .",
    "these estimates were then assembled in the histogram of figure 1 .",
    "this histogram shows that the @xmath45 qsos are just the high end of a smooth distribution of @xmath36 for the complete sample and are not outliers . over 30% of the qsos",
    "have @xmath63 .",
    "this method of assigning @xmath45 to a qso is very conservative . a single large estimate for @xmath28 will swamp the other smaller @xmath28 estimates and suppress the large @xmath36 values ( such as in 3c 196 , 3c 190 and 3c 455 ) .",
    "if one were to average the @xmath36 values instead then large @xmath28 would be suppressed and there would be four 3crr qso with @xmath64 .",
    "there are two major facts that allow a clear interpretation of the effect of the errors in the estimation techniques on the @xmath65 qsos in table 1 and figure 1 .",
    "firstly , the detailed investigation of 3c 216 in @xcite illustrates the existence of @xmath45 qsos very convincingly . the @xmath66 condition in 3c 216",
    "is verified by three independent estimators of @xmath28 , f(h@xmath29 ) , f(mg ii ) , and the host bulge luminosity .",
    "secondly , there is no evidence that the scatter in the best fit estimators is skewed asymmetrically to low values of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "comparisons to reverberation mapping based estimates indicate that the errors are symmetrically distributed about the best fit estimators , eg .",
    "figure 9 of @xcite .",
    "if not for these facts , one could take a pessimistic view and plausibly argue that the @xmath45 sources in table 1 and figure 1 are an artifact of selecting those sources in which the errors associated with the line width estimation techniques have underestimated @xmath28 .",
    "this argument implicitly assumes that the high end of the @xmath67 distribution represents the variance in the line width estimators , not the actual spread in @xmath28 .",
    "however , the example of 3c 216 demonstrates that @xmath45 sources exist , indicating that the more reasonable explanation of figure 1 is that the errors in the estimates are randomly distributed and they are not skewed preferentially to produce low @xmath28 . in particular , some of the sources with @xmath45 are probably actually , @xmath68 sources , but a similar number of the @xmath69 sources are actually @xmath45 sources .",
    "it is worth expanding the discussion of the @xmath45 sources beyond the most conservative of claims made above .",
    "this condition is far stronger than @xmath70 and in general indicates episodic values of @xmath4 considerably in excess of @xmath71 .",
    "more realistically based on the discussion of section 3.1 , all the sources that have @xmath63 almost certainly had episodes in which @xmath72 and the @xmath7 condition was satisfied .",
    "considering that the median value in figure 1 is @xmath73 , @xmath74 of the the 3c sources were likely to have been kinetically dominated at some time in their past .",
    "this claim can not be extended to the fr ii population as a whole , but is a consequence of the fact that the 3c qsos typically reside at the high end of the steep extended luminosity distribution for radio loud quasars .",
    "the article demonstrates that many fr ii sources are likely to exist in a state of @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath45 jets must satisfy @xmath75>1 $ ] , or else the accretion disks of the broad line agn would episodically be in an un - physical state of @xmath76 .",
    "the mid - ir 3c sample of @xcite indicated that @xmath77 of the fr ii narrow line radio galaxies had no hidden quasar .",
    "based on the discussion above , these are likely candidates to be in a state of @xmath7 .    as a consequence of the near independence of the uv spectrum on the radio state , @xcite , it has been argued that the black hole and not the accretion disk is the power source for fr ii jets @xcite .",
    "a large scale magnetic flux trapped within the central vortex of an accretion disk can produce relativistic jets , as seen in the mhd numerical simulations of @xcite . yet , as discussed in @xcite these simulations are restricted to a maximum @xmath78 value , @xmath79 .",
    "the magnetic field line configuration leading to a relativistic jet is created and maintained by `` pinning '' the poloidal flux to the event horizon by a strong accretion flow in conjunction with an incredibly massive and unobserved enveloping wind that transports @xmath80 of relativistically hot protonic gas at 0.3c-0.4c for an fr ii quasar @xcite .",
    "the black hole actually gains energy over time due to the intense accretion flow ( and associated energy influx ) required to compress a large magnetic flux onto the small surface area of the event horizon .",
    "thus , a jet with large q requires an intense accretion flow that will radiate profusely for the radiative efficiency predicted in these simulations , @xcite , and @xmath81    alternatively , the black hole energy extraction model of @xcite and references therein that was numerically realized in @xcite is based on large scale magnetic flux that threads the equatorial plane of the ergosphere ( the active region ) of a black hole @xcite .",
    "the theoretical @xmath0 values are 2 orders of magnitude larger than for flux pinned on the event horizon because the surface area of the equatorial plane in the ergosphere is @xmath82 times larger than the surface area of the horizon that is threaded by magnetic flux in simulations of @xcite for rapidly spinning black holes ( parameterized by @xmath83 , where `` a '' is the angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole in geometrized units ) , and the jet power scales like the surface area squared @xcite .",
    "these solutions attain a value , @xmath84 , that was calculated in @xcite , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow , @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the accretion rate from the disk to the black hole .",
    "the maximum efficiency from a thin disk is @xmath89 @xcite . for high @xmath1 objects , luminous quasars",
    ", one expects @xmath86 to be near maximal and @xmath83 ( see @xcite ) , thus @xmath90 which would explain the high q episodes required to maintain a long term time average of @xmath45 .",
    "these arguments seem to indicate that the essential element that separates a radio quiet qso from one that launches a strong fr ii jet with @xmath91 is the formation of strong vertical magnetic flux in the equatorial plane of the ergosphere .",
    "this is prevented in the simulations of @xcite as a very weak seed magnetic field is swept up in a single mhd fluid and compressed onto the black hole .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have investigated low angular momentum flux tubes that evolve separately from the bulk of the mhd fluid . in the two - fluid dynamics , the strong flux tubes `` swim '' relative to the bulk mhd fluid and slowly move into the ergosphere . this could be an essential piece of missing dynamics in the present codes .",
