    "apart from the fact that phase - space diagrams are very useful in visualizing the dynamical picture ( especially for the considered two - dimensional problem ) , we also can be sure that we did not miss some important regimes during local analysis .",

    "this allows us to characterize completely the global feature of cosmological dynamics in the model in question using a limiting number of phase portraits .",

    "section  7 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we consider models described by the following action : @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a constant that corresponds to the planck mass in the einstein gravity , @xmath8 is the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are differentiable functions of the scalar field  @xmath13 .",
    "we use the signature @xmath14 , and  @xmath15 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath16 .    consider the evolution of a homogeneous scalar field on a spatially flat flrw universe with the interval @xmath17 in this metric the einstein equations derived from the variation of action ( [ action ] ) are as follows : @xmath18 @xmath19={}-\\frac{1}{2}{\\dot { \\varphi}}^{2}+v+2\\xi h   b'\\dot { \\varphi}+\\xi\\left(b''\\dot{\\varphi}^2+b'\\ddot{\\varphi}\\right),\\ ] ] where differentiation with respect to time @xmath20 is denoted by a dot , the prime indicates the derivative with respect to the scalar field @xmath13 , and the hubble parameter is the logarithmic derivative of the scale factor : @xmath21 .",
    "the variation of action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath13 gives the klein ",
    "gordon equation @xmath22 and the ricci scalar in the flrw metric is given by @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath24    combining equations ( [ equ00 ] ) and ( [ equ11 ] ) we get @xmath25    for convenience , we shall use the system of units with @xmath26 ( the same units have been used in  @xcite ) . from the system of equations ( [ equ00 ] ) , ( [ equ11 ] ) , and ( [ equ_sigma ] )",
    "we get the following system of the first order equations : @xmath27 @xmath28    the hubble parameter @xmath29 can be found from the quadratic equation  ( [ equ00 ] ) , therefore , @xmath30    note that @xmath29 is a continuous function , so , if the radicand is not equal to zero at any moment of time , then the initial conditions define the sign `` @xmath31 '' or `` @xmath32 '' in ( [ h ] ) . for example , if @xmath7 and @xmath33 , then for a positive - definite potential @xmath12 this sign is defined uniquely .    in this paper",
    ", we choose the sing `` @xmath31 '' , substitute the corresponding hubble parameter into  ( [ eq_phitt ] ) , and get that the second order system  ( [ eq_phitt ] ) determines the dynamics of the considering cosmological model .",
    "our discussion will be restricted to power - law functions @xmath34 .",
    "most of our discussions deal with power - law potentials @xmath35 , certain particular cases of more general potentials @xmath36 will be considered as well . in this paper , we study only positively defined potentials , @xmath7 and coupling functions with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 that are chosen to be even numbers .",
    "for qualitative description of the scalar field evolution it is useful to find points where the driving force vanishes , so @xmath40 is a solution .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq_phitt ] ) that such points correspond to critical points of the effective potential @xmath41 because @xmath42    after appropriate transformation of the scalar field this potential becomes proportional to the potential in the einstein frame  the theory conformally invariant to the initial one , where a scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "we do not provide full transition to the einstein frame here because the form of the effective potential given above without any additional transformation of the scalar field gives us enough information about the stability of de sitter solutions in the theory under consideration .",
    "it is evident that the form of the effective potential having its extreme at @xmath40 as a solution is not unique , so we use the form chosen for its simplicity ( it was used already in the similar context in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the important thing is that the third term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq_phitt ] ) differs from @xmath43 by function @xmath44 which is always positive ( for @xmath7 ) and thus does not affect global properties of the dynamics .",
    "let us rewrite equations ( [ equ00 ] ) and ( [ fr21 ] ) in the form similar to the friedmann equations in the einstein frame .",
    "we introduce a new variable @xmath45 where @xmath46 . in terms of @xmath47 eq .",
    "( [ equ00 ] ) has the following form @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "we consider @xmath50 only , so @xmath51 at any @xmath13 . using ( [ equ00 ] ) , we get from eq .",
    "( [ fr21 ] ) the following equation : @xmath52 now we differentiate ( [ equp ] ) over time , substitute ( [ fr21qm ] ) and get @xmath53    the de sitter solutions corresponds to @xmath54 , and hence , @xmath55 , in other words @xmath56 the corresponding hubble parameter is @xmath57    let us consider the lyapunov stability of a de sitter solution . substituting @xmath58 into ( [ system2 ] ) , we get the following linear system on @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath61    so , the considering de sitter solution is stable under conditions @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in other words ,",
    "the model has a stable de sitter solution only if the potential @xmath64 have a minimum .",
    "note that this conclusion is valid for arbitrary differentiable functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 , under the condition @xmath67 .    in the case of power - law potential @xmath35 there exists the following de sitter solution : @xmath68^{1/n}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] note that this solution does not exist for @xmath69 .",
    "so , we consider the case @xmath70 . also , we assume that the potential is positive : @xmath71 .",
    "the stability of de sitter solutions in the case of power - law potentials has been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the use of the effective potential makes this analysis more trivial .",
    "indeed , in the case of a power - law potential @xmath66 the de sitter solution is located at a point of a local maximum of the effective potential @xmath64 and is unstable at @xmath7 and any values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for example , at @xmath72 we get @xmath73    also , there are stable minkowski solutions at the point @xmath74 .",
    "note that potentials @xmath66 having more complicated form than a simple monomial can generate a stable de sitter solution even without an explicit @xmath75 term in the action ( see the end of the section  [ sectionpolypot ] , where the corresponding effective potential is presented in fig .",
    "[ v6_2 ] ) .",
    "in this section we consider regimes for which @xmath76 .",
    "though the effective potential can not help in identifying all of them , it can be useful in order to find some sort of stable solutions .",
    "the reason is that the first and second terms in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq_phitt ] ) represent in the case of negative @xmath8 the positive friction terms if @xmath77  though the second term can not now be considered as small , it is negative in this limit as well as the first term . as a result , system  ( [ eq_phitt ] ) describes behavior of an oscillator with a driving force ( the third term in the right - hand side of ( [ eq_phitt ] ) ) and a positive friction ( the first and second terms ) .",
    "this means that influence of initial conditions should be washed out after some time , and the dynamics appears to be determined by the driving force solely .",
    "this driving force pushes the field @xmath13 to infinity if the effective potential is decreasing as a function of @xmath13 for large @xmath13",
    ". such behavior of the effective potential occurs for certain important cases ( see below ) . in the next two subsections we present these regimes explicitly , as well as other regimes which can not be guessed from the form of the effective potential ( all of them appear to be unstable ) .",
    "now we list asymptotic solutions for system ( [ eq_ht])([eq_phitt ] ) in the limit @xmath77 that has been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "we remind these solutions and show the correspondence between behaviors of these solutions and properties of the effective potentials .",
    "these solutions do not require the power index of the potential to be integer , though we will not consider a noninteger ( as well as odd integer ) @xmath1 in the present paper .",
    "as the case of @xmath79 is exceptional , so , we consider it separately in the next subsection .",
    "consistency analysis shows that the solution @xmath80 exists for @xmath78 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "this solution corresponds to the situation in which the scalar field potential is negligible .",
    "as this regime is an unstable node @xcite , it represents a source point on phase - space diagrams .",
    "it is interesting that the corresponding regime for a massless minimally coupled scalar field has a scale factor changing as time in the power @xmath83 instead of @xmath84 here , so the @xmath78 case represents a clear discontinuity in the limit @xmath85 .",
    "the power - law solution corresponds to @xmath86 at @xmath2 and @xmath82 at @xmath87 .",
    "] @xmath88 is stable for @xmath70 and unstable for @xmath4 .",
    "this solution ( in contrast to the previous one ) depends on the scalar field potential .",
    "the effective potential is decreasing for large @xmath13 if @xmath70 , so stability of this regime can be qualitatively explained by arguments presented in the beginning of this section .",
    "as for the particular properties of instability for @xmath4 , the full analysis gives us the following result  @xcite : for very steep potentials with @xmath89 it is an unstable node ( and plays the role of source point when the point corresponding to solution ( [ 9 ] ) does not exist ) , for @xmath90 it is a saddle .",
    "it is clear that this solution is absent for @xmath91 or @xmath6 . for the former case a special stable regime exists described below .",
    "+ * 3*. in the case of @xmath5 there exists the following solution with a constant hubble parameter @xmath92 : @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "note that the scalar field @xmath13 increases exponentially giving rise to exponentially decreasing the effective newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "for this reason such a solution does not qualify as a de sitter one .",
    "we keep the notion of a de sitter solution for the solution with @xmath95 and @xmath40 .",
    "the case of @xmath6 will be discussed in subsection 4.3 .",
    "* there exists the following effective massless solution : @xmath96 in contrast to its @xmath97 analog , given by ( [ 9 ] ) , the power indices of solution ( [ n2sol1 ] ) do depend on @xmath8 .",
    "however , for @xmath7 and @xmath98 the stability analysis shows that properties of this point do not `` feel '' @xmath8  it is always a source on phase space diagrams . for steep potentials ( @xmath99 )",
    "this solution exists only in an interval @xmath100 where @xmath101 ( in the @xmath102 case the situation is more complicated , and we will not consider it in the present paper ) .",
    "there is an analog of the power - law solution written down above for general @xmath0 : @xmath103 from the form of the effective potential we can see that it is an attractor for @xmath104 .",
    "this solution has been found more than two decades ago in @xcite , and its big rip nature for @xmath105 has been discussed in @xcite . using methods of @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to show that this regime is a saddle point on the phase - space diagram for @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath99 it becomes an unstable node for @xmath107  exactly in the range where solution ( 12 ) does not exist .",
    "as for the general case , we have a special form for the case of equal power indices .",
    "* 3 . * in the case of @xmath72 there exists the following solution with a constant hubble parameter @xmath92 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 . as its @xmath78 analog , this regime is an attractor .",
    "the case of @xmath110 will be considered in the next subsection .      in this subsection",
    "we consider a solution which shares the time behavior of the hubble parameter with the known ruzmaikin solution in @xmath111 gravity  @xcite .",

    "other terms give the equation connecting @xmath120 and @xmath121 : @xmath122 now we substitute @xmath112 , @xmath123 in ( [ equ00 ] ) and get @xmath124=-108\\xi^3\\varphi_0^n\\varphi^{2n}-18\\xi^2\\varphi_0^n\\varphi^{n}-\\frac{2}{n^2 \\varphi_0^n}\\varphi^{2-n}.\\ ] ] thereby , we get that the potential has the form @xmath125 and the ruzmaikin - type solution has the following numeric parameters : @xmath126    the first term in the potential gives the desired asymptotic for @xmath77 if @xmath6 .    the particular case of @xmath79 and @xmath110 is well known because it is used to describe the higgs - driven inflation .",
    "the corresponding effective potential is asymptotically flat ( this is valid also for a general @xmath6 case ) , as well as the potential in the einstein frame .",
    "the latter is the reason why inflation does not need extremely small self - coupling coefficient as in the minimally coupled field case .",
    "a connection between this model and modified gravity has already been remarked . in particular , the theory in question shares the same form of potential in the einstein frame with the @xmath111 gravity ( see @xcite with the interesting discussion about differences in these two theories during post - inflationary dynamics ) .",
    "we see now that this connection exists also on the level of jordan frames .",
    "the @xmath127 dynamics represents the ruzmaikin solution in quadratic gravity known for decades .",
    "it is unstable for the @xmath111 theory which is used in the starobinsky inflation scenario  @xcite . in the present subsection",
    "we have found an asymptotic solution with the same time behavior of @xmath128 in the jordan frame of nonminimally coupled scalar field theory with @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting that in the @xmath79 case we can construct a polynomial potential for which a solution with the hubble parameter evolving linearly in time becomes an _",

    "the phase - space analysis allows the unfolding of many feature of the cosmological models with scalar fields  @xcite . for the part of the obtained solutions the values of the scalar field and its derivative can go to infinity . for this reason we introduce auxiliary variables , which are always restricted by the unit circulus .",

    "in the present paper we have made a global qualitative analysis for the cosmological dynamics with a nonminimally coupled scalar field with power - law coupling functions and potentials . local analysis provided in @xcite",
    "shows that for @xmath7 stability properties of asymptotic solutions do not depend on @xmath8 and depend only upon power indices @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the coupling function @xmath152 and the scalar field potential @xmath66 correspondingly .",
    "this allows us to cover most interesting cases of small @xmath0 and @xmath1 by a limiting number of phase - space diagrams .",
    "we argue that usage of effective potential @xmath64 helps significantly to understand different cases of qualitatively different dynamics .",
    "this does not require a full transition to the einstein frame which can be rather cumbersome .",
    "we identify three qualitatively different points of scalar field dynamics realized for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and two boundary cases of @xmath91 and @xmath6 .",
    "the latter is of particular interest because it contains ( and generalizes ) the higgs inflation proposal .",
    "all fixed points for corresponding dynamics found in @xcite are incorporated into the global phase diagram constructed in the present paper",
    ".    some interesting modifications of possible phase diagrams when more general potentials are allowed also have been presented .",
    "in particular , we study the influence of the explicit cosmological constant in the action of the theory .",
    "it is interesting , that , unlike the minimally coupled case , nonzero @xmath75 in the action does not automatically lead to the existence of a de sitter solution .",
    "the opposite is also true - there are theories ( for example , with @xmath231 and quadratic coupling ) which have stable de sitter solutions without a cosmological constant in the action",
