    "we present new vlba data that , in combination with the previous data , allow us to measure the flux densities of all three components at four widely spaced frequencies .",
    "our analysis shows that c has a significantly different radio spectrum than a and b. we argue that there are two alternative explanations for this difference . either c is not a third quasar image , and instead is the active nucleus of the lens galaxy ; or , c is a third image , but its spectral index is inverted by free - free absorption in the lens galaxy .",
    "whichever of these possibilities is true , the additional information from the vlba data provides more constraints on mass models of the lens galaxy than are usually available for a two - image lens .",
    "if the central component is a third image , then its position and flux are valuable constraints .",
    "if the central component is the lens galaxy , then our data provide an unusually precise position for the lens galaxy , and a strong upper limit on the flux of a third image .",
    "the vlba maps also reveal the relative orientations of the radio jets associated with a and b. as with all gravitational lensing studies , we still do not have enough information to determine the complete density profile of the lens galaxy , but we can use parameterized models to explore the implications of the data .    historically , two classes of parameterized models have been used to study the central - image problem : models with constant - density cores , and models with central cusps .",
    "early studies used softened power laws , @xmath10 , and found that central images are suppressed if the core radius @xmath11 is sufficiently small ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the demagnification of the central image is determined by the central surface density , steeper density profiles ( larger @xmath12 ) allow for larger core radii for the same flux limit on the central image .",

    "these are discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : variability]  [ subsec : propagation ] .",
    "the only mechanism we can not rule out is free - free absorption (   [ subsec : propagation ] ) .      how does the flux density of c compare with the flux density expected from a typical galaxy at the lens redshift ? given the radio flux density and spectral index of component c that were presented in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] , and the lens redshift estimate of @xmath52 , the implied 1.4  ghz luminosity of the lens galaxy is @xmath53  w  hz@xmath16 .",
    "this is significantly more powerful than the radio emission observed from ordinary galaxies , which is thought to arise from star formation and is limited to @xmath54  w  hz@xmath16 .",
    "however , it is within the observed range of luminosities from galaxies harboring active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "for example , @xcite identified a sample of 420 agn in the 2df galaxy redshift survey , of which 24% had a 1.4  ghz radio luminosity at least as large as the implied luminosity of component c ( after correcting for their different choice of cosmology ) .",
    "we conclude that the identification of component c as the active galactic nucleus of the lens galaxy is a reasonable one .",
    "this would make unusual among the known lenses , but not unique ; the lens galaxy of b2045 + 265 has a bright central component that is almost certainly an active nucleus @xcite .",
    "if the source is variable , then the instantaneous flux density ratios between the lensed images will fluctuate , due to the differential time delays between the images .",
    "if , in addition , the degree of variability depends on frequency , then the flux density ratios will vary with frequency .",
    "however , the differential time delay between components b and c is expected to be very small ( @xmath550.5  day ) .",
    "this is much smaller than typical time scales for quasar variability ( @xmath7months ) .",
    "indeed , our measurements , which were spaced apart by one day , showed no sign of variability .",
    "we therefore discount the possibility that variability is the reason for the discrepancy of spectral indices .",
    "if the background radio source is extended and has sub - components with different spectral indices , then these sub - components may each be magnified by a different factor ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case , the sum of flux densities of the sub - components in a lensed image would not necessarily have the same spectral index as the corresponding sum in a different image .",
    "however , in the case of j16320033 , the source is very compact . from fig .",
    "[ fig : vlba-3.5 cm ] we can limit the separation of sub - components in image a to @xmath555  mas , corresponding to a change in magnification of only @xmath56 in an isothermal model . furthermore , the agreement of @xmath44 and @xmath57 argues against the presence of a significant effect from frequency - dependent radio substructure .      if a radio source has structure on large angular scales , with fourier components corresponding to smaller spatial frequencies than those measured by an interferometer , then that portion of the radio source is invisible to the interferometer .",
    "the invisible radio structure is said to be `` resolved out . ''",
    "we must consider the possibility that the spectral indices of a and c are different only because the components are being resolved out by different amounts at each frequency .",
    "we reject this hypothesis based on three facts .",
    "first , there can not be much resolved - out structure in components a and b. during a monitoring program , we measured their flux densities at 8.4  ghz with the vla on 2002  march  14 , simultaneous with the vlba measurement described in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] .",
    "the vlba flux densities were @xmath58 of the vla flux densities , despite being measured on angular scales @xmath7200 times smaller .",
    "second , if c is a third quasar image , it is demagnified by a factor of @xmath710@xmath59 and would have an even smaller fraction of resolved - out structure than a or b. third , even if there is resolved - out structure in a , it would be expected to have a steep radio spectrum , because the extended jets of quasars generally have steeper spectra than the compact cores .",
    "this would only worsen the discrepancy between the spectral indices of a and c , by causing the true spectral index of a to be steeper than observed .",
    "propagation effects that are chromatic , and that affect each lensed image by a different amount , will cause the spectra of the images to differ . for example , reddening by dust causes the optical colors of lensed images to differ ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the propagation effects are due to interstellar plasma .",
    "the polarizations of lensed images may differ due to faraday rotation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . or , in a phenomenon known as `` scatter - broadening , '' the angular size of a lensed image may be increased due to scattering by electron - density fluctuations along the line of sight ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , these two effects do not alter the spectral indices of lensed images .",
    "a possible exception might arise from scatter - broadening , if it causes a frequency - dependent amount of flux to be resolved out ( see   [ subsec : resolved ] above ) , but our data do not show the characteristic @xmath60 dependence of angular size due to scatter - broadening .",
    "one propagation effect that would alter the spectral indices of lensed images is free - free absorption by electrons in the lens galaxy .",
    "free - free absorption decreases strongly with frequency , which would flatten or invert the spectral index of the central component .",
    "we must therefore consider the possibility that component c is a third quasar image whose spectral index has been inverted by free - free absorption .",
    "assuming that c is affected by free - free absorption , and a is not , we would expect the flux density ratio to obey  @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the lensing magnification ratio and @xmath63 is the optical depth to free - free absorption . here",
    "@xmath64 is the frequency at the lens redshift .",
    "a useful approximation for @xmath63 has been given by @xcite and @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the electron temperature and number density , and @xmath68 is defined implicitly .",
    "this formula predicts a sharp cut - off at low frequencies , and the asymptotic limit  @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "we solved for the values of the two parameters @xmath68 and @xmath71 that provide the best fit to the data .",
    "the results were @xmath72  ghz ( @xmath73  ghz ) and @xmath74 .",
    "the dotted line in fig  [ fig : ratios ] shows the best - fitting curve , which is statistically consistent with the data ( @xmath75 with 3 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "there are no published cases of free - free absorption by a lens galaxy for comparison",
    ". however , the best - fitting value @xmath72  ghz is comparable to the values of @xmath76  110  ghz that have been inferred for the central regions of some active galaxies , using multi - frequency vlbi measurements of radio jets ( for recent examples , see marr , taylor , & crawford 2001 , jones et al .",
    "2001 , kameno et al .  2000 ,",
    "taylor 1996 , and levinson , laor , & vermuelen 1995 ) .",
    "because the data are quantitatively consistent with both the third - image hypothesis and the free - free absorption hypothesis , we have only our prior prejudice on the relative likelihood of these two possibilities to guide us",
    ". one might object that the third - image hypothesis is contrived , because neither a central image nor free - free absorption has previously been observed in a radio lens .",
    "however , we do not consider this `` double novelty '' as a serious objection because a central image might be expected to suffer more absorption than other images , due to the potentially large electron column density near the center of the lens galaxy .",
    "for this reason , we take a neutral position , and consider the consequences of both hypotheses in the section that follows .",
    "in this section we use information from the vlba maps to update the lens models for that were presented by @xcite .",
    "the goal of our analysis is to investigate the improvement that results when two extra pieces of information are available besides the usual image positions and fluxes : the relative orientations of the radio jets , and a strong constraint ( either a measurement or an upper limit ) on the flux of a central image . in ",

    "the magnification ratio @xmath79 is the average of the 15 measurements of  presented in this paper and by @xcite , and the uncertainty is the variance in those measurements . in theory ,",
    "our error estimates for the positions and magnification ratio should be enlarged ( to @xmath71 - 2  mas and 10 - 20% , respectively ) to account for possible mass substructure in the lens galaxy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in all the cases described below , the error statistic is dominated by either the third - image flux or the jet orientations , causing the precise values of the uncertainties on the positions and magnification ratio to be unimportant .",

    "although in principle there could be a complicated angular structure in the lens model , due to the ellipticity of the lens galaxy and due to external perturbations , we do not have enough constraints to explore such models .",

    "the non - isothermal profile at large radii must be compensated by a nearly isothermal profile within a fairly large break radius .",
    "again , we see that if the mass profile obeys a power law over the range of radii between images a and b , then the favored distribution is close to isothermal .",
    "for the three - image scenario , we use the model constraints given in table  [ tbl : model - constraints-2 ] . in this case , the lens galaxy position is taken from the optical measurement of @xcite , with error bars enlarged to 23  mas ( 0.5 pixel ) to allow for systematic errors .",
    "the value adopted for   is based on the fit to the free - free absorption model described in   [ subsec : propagation ] .",
    "we define the goodness - of - fit parameter as    @xmath116    + \\sum_{i={\\rm a , b } } \\left [            \\frac{(\\phi'_i-\\phi_i)^2}{(\\delta\\phi_i)^2 } \\right ]    + \\frac{(\\mu'_{\\rm ba}-\\mu_{\\rm ba})^2}{(\\delta\\mu_{\\rm ba})^2 }    + \\frac{(\\mu'_{\\rm ca}-\\mu_{\\rm ca})^2}{(\\delta\\mu_{\\rm ca})^2},\\ ] ]    in which primed quantities are those determined by the model , and unprimed quantities are those observed .    for a scale - free power - law profile in an external shear field",
    ", we have three degrees of freedom .",
    "the model does a good job of reproducing the configuration , with @xmath117 .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the density profile in the optimal model is @xmath118 ( @xmath1 ) . if we take the radial density profile to be isothermal with a constant - density core , as in eq .",
    "[ eq : sis - core ] , we can also achieve a reasonable fit ( @xmath119 ) , with the optimal value @xmath120  milliarcseconds , or @xmath121  parsecs , and a @xmath1 confidence region of 3.67.8  mas .",
    "when we apply the cuspy lens model of eq .",
    "[ eq : cuspy ] , we find that the allowed region of cusp parameters is much more tightly constrained than they are in the two - image lens models . figure  [ fig : cusp3 ] shows the results for models in which the radial density distribution at large radii is isothermal ( left panel ) , or obeys a power law with logarithmic slope @xmath111 ( upper right ) , or @xmath112 ( lower right ) .",
    "both boundaries of the allowed region ( shaded ) are enforced by the constraint on the third - image flux . in particular , for @xmath122 , no third image is produced . for large @xmath104",
    ", the cusp must conform to the value @xmath123 derived above . as @xmath104 becomes smaller",
    ", the inner mass distribution must become shallower to compensate for the steeper mass distribution at large radii .",
    "for the purpose of finding central odd images , the best systems are radio - loud two - image quasars with a large magnification ratio between the two bright images .",
    "radio loudness is important because the radio components can be observed through the lens galaxy , whereas optical components are likely to be hidden by the lens galaxy .",
    "free - free absorption is potentially significant but can be overcome by observing at high frequencies .",
    "two - image systems are better than four - image systems , as emphasized recently by @xcite .",
    "this is because the projected source position in four - image systems is usually closer to the lens center , where the central image magnification is smallest .",
    "in addition , four - image systems are subject to a larger magnification bias than two - image systems @xcite , leading to a smaller intrinsic source flux and a fainter odd image . among two - image systems ,",
    "the asymmetric doubles are favorable because the source position is close to the radial caustic , producing the brightest possible central image for a given mass distribution .",
    "the subject of this paper , pmn  j16320033 , is exactly this type of system : an asymmetric two - image radio lens .",
    "for this reason , it seemed reasonable that the third component found by @xcite could be an example of the elusive and long - sought central odd images .",
    "however , we have shown that the third component has a spectral index that differs by @xmath48 from those of the two bright quasar images .",
    "we have argued that the two most plausible interpretations are that the central component is emission from the lens galaxy , or else that it is a third image with the extra complication that its spectral index has been modified by free - free absorption .",
    "the data are quantitatively consistent with either scenario .",
    "lens galaxies are rarely radio - loud , but the flux density of the component is consistent with typical radio powers of active galactic nuclei .",
    "no central image has ever been securely identified for a radio lens , nor has free - free absorption by a lens galaxy ever been reported ( with one possible exception , class  b0128 + 437 ; i.  browne 2002 , private communication ) , but one might expect the two phenomena to be related due to the hot and dense conditions near galaxy centers .    given the new vlbi data , we have investigated models for the mass distribution of the lens galaxy under various assumptions .",
    "whether or not component c is a third image , we showed that if the mass distribution obeys a power law @xmath124 , then it must be nearly isothermal .",
    "if c is the lens galaxy then @xmath125 .",
    "if c is a third image then the profile is tightly constrained to be only slightly shallower : @xmath126 .",
    "we also derived limits on a constant - density core radius , or on the break radius and inner exponent of a central cusp .",
    "these results can be added to the growing collection of evidence that early - type galaxies have nearly isothermal mass profiles . in the few other gravitational lens systems where it is possible to measure the radial density profile , the results favor isothermal profiles @xcite ,",
    "although there are some possible counter - examples @xcite .",
    "moreover , the findings are consistent with studies of early - type galaxies based on stellar dynamics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and x - ray halos ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to further elucidate the nature of the central component and the central density profile of the lens galaxy",
    ", it would help to have a better optical image of the lens galaxy .",
    "the current hst image provides only a weak detection of the lens galaxy .",
    "a better image could be used to test more precisely whether radio component c is coincident with the center of the lens galaxy , and to study its surface brightness profile in detail .",
    "for example , with a better measurement of the galaxy light profile , one might be able to explore the balance between the luminous and dark matter in this system .",
    "even more helpful would be sensitive observations at high radio frequencies ( @xmath12730  ghz ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] , the power - law and the free - free absorption fits diverge significantly at high frequencies , where free - free absorption becomes negligible . for free - free absorption , the ratio  must converge to a constant value . for lens galaxy emission ,",
    "the spectrum need not follow a power law at the high frequencies , but it would require an unlikely coincidence for the intrinsic radio spectrum of the lens galaxy to turn over at high frequencies and become identical to the radio spectra of a and b. observations at low radio frequencies ( @xmath1281  ghz ) could also distinguish the hypotheses , in principle , but it would be harder to achieve the necessary angular resolution and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "high frequency observations present their own challenges , including high noise levels and susceptibility to poor atmospheric conditions , but the reward would be a definitive discovery of one of the long - sought but never - seen central images of a gravitational lens .",
