    "the extreme outer galaxy ( eog ) , which we define as the region with a galactic radius ( @xmath2 ) of more than 18 kpc , has a very different environment from the regions near our solar system , since it has a much lower gas density , lower metallicity ( see the metallicity gradient curve in , e.g. , smartt & rolleston 1997 ) and small or no perturbation from spiral arms .",
    "such a region is not only of strong interest in itself , but it also provides a good opportunity to study astronomical processes , such as star formation ,    wouterloot & brand ( 1989 ) , wouterloot et al .",

    "digel , de geus , & thaddeus ( 1994 ) found eleven molecular clouds , including cloud 2 , in the eog based on co observations of distant peaks in the maryland - green bank survey ( westerhout & wendlant 1982 ) . following those pioneering works , heyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conducted a comprehensive co survey of molecular clouds in the outer galaxy with the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) co survey .",

    "santos et al . ( 2000 ) and later snell , carpenter , & heyer ( 2002 ) found .",
    "recently , brand & wouterloot ( 2007 ) also reported a discovery of an embedded cluster in a molecular cloud , wb89 - 789 , at the probable galactic radius of @xmath020 kpc , which marks one of the most distant embedded clusters in the eog .    here",
    "we report the discovery of two embedded clusters in digel s cloud 2 , which is one of the most distant molecular clouds in the eog ( digel et al .",

    "originally , the kinematic distance to cloud 2 was estimated at @xmath3 kpc ( heliocentric distance : @xmath4 kpc ) , while the latest observation by stil & irwin ( 2001 ) suggests @xmath5 kpc ( @xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "the ambient density at @xmath2 @xmath0 20 kpc is thought to be very low because of the small surface density and the large - scale height : @xmath7 could be as low as 0.001 @xmath8 ( e.g. , nakanishi & sofue 2003 )",
    ". the metallicity of cloud 2 is estimated at @xmath9 dex from the radio molecular lines ( lubowich et al .",
    "2004 ; see also ruffle et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is consistent with the metallicity of mr-1 as measured by optical spectroscopy ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 dex : smartt et al .",
    "1996 ; rolleston et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the latest observation by stil & irwin ( 2001 ) revealed that a remarkably large supernovae remnant ( snr ) shell , gsh 138 - 01 - 94 , is associated with cloud 2 .",
    "because there is little or no perturbation from the spiral arms in the eog enviroment , therefore , cloud 2 is an excellent place to study sn - triggered star formation , which is thought to be one of the major star formation processes in galaxies ( e.g. , elmegreen 2002 ) .",
    "the low metallicities in the eog regions are comparable to those for galactic thick disk stars ( e.g. , brewer & carney 2006 ) , dwarf irregular galaxies , and damped lyman-@xmath12 systems ( e.g. , pettini 2004 ) . in conjunction with the very low gas density and lack of spiral arm perturbation , the eog may approximate the environment of star formation in the early universe .",
    "studies of the chemical composition of halo stars in our galaxy show that star formation in the early epoch of the galaxy s formation was mostly triggered by supernovae ( ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ; audouze & silk 1995 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) .",

    "we used only the dataset of the third night , when the seeing conditions were best ( @xmath00@xmath185 ) and the star clusters were clearly resolved .",
    "the sky was covered with occasional thin cirrus on that night , but the photometric uncertainty due to cirrus was insignificant .",
    "the total integration time was 5 , 10 , 15 min for @xmath15- , @xmath14- , and @xmath13-bands , respectively .    all the data for each band were reduced with iraf with standard procedures : dark subtraction , flat - fielding , bad - pixel correction , median - sky subtraction , image shifts with dithering offsets , and combining .",

    "the density for cloud 2-s is typical for young embedded clusters , but that of cloud 2-n is less than the lower boundary for clusters listed in lada & lada ( 2003 ) .",
    "there is a bright star at the center of the cloud 2-s cluster . assuming a distance modulus of 15.4 , the @xmath15-band luminosity of the brightest star is @xmath26 @xmath0 , which is consistent with that of a late b - type star ( tokunaga 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the cloud 2-s cluster seems to be a star cluster aggregating around a relatively massive star , most likely a herbig ae / be star ( see , e.g. , testi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "kobayashi & tokunaga ( 2000 ) found several bright young stellar objects ( ysos ) in and around cloud 2 . besides irs 2 and 3 , which are resolved as clusters in cloud 2-s ,",
    "other irs sources ( irs 1 , 4 , and 5 ) are also detected and resolved in our new images ( fig .",
    "those bright isolated infrared stars are located eastward of the molecular cloud ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . their @xmath15-band absolute magnitudes ( @xmath27 ; kobayashi & tokunaga 2000 ) and @xmath22 excess suggest all of them are dust enshrouded intermediate - mass stars , probably herbig ae / be stars .",
    "irs 1 , which is just outside of cloud 2-n , appears to be a single star , but it has an extended nebulosity in ne  sw direction ( see the left panel in fig .",

    "irs 4 and 5 , which are eastward of cloud 2-s , have faint red companion stars to the west ( see the middle and right panels in fig .",
    "3 ) , suggesting they form typical small aggregations around intermediate - mass stars ( testi et al .",
    "besides the clusters and the isolated ysos , other star formation ",
    "related activities are known in the cloud 2 region . soon after the discovery of cloud 2 , de geus et al .",
    "( 1993 ) discovered an associated extended region with an h@xmath12 emission line , and a visible star , mr-1 , which had been already found by an independent blue star search in the outer galaxy ( muzzio & rydgren 1974 ) , was recognized as a probable exciting source of the region .",
    "stil & irwin ( 2001 ) found extended 21 cm ( 1.4 ghz ) continuum emission projected on cloud 2-n and that it is located on the maxima of the h@xmath12 intensity map of de geus et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "based on the correlation with h@xmath12 and the absence of a counterpart at 74 cm , stil & irwin ( 2001 ) suggested that the continuum emission is thermal emission from an region .",
    "figure [ fig : f4 ] summarizes the star formation activities in cloud 2 : the locations of nir objects and mr-1 are overplotted on the 21 cm grayscale image , 1.4 ghz radio continuum coutour , and @xmath1co ( 1 - 0 ) contour from our nobeyama data .",
    "figure 4 clearly shows that the co emission delineates the inner edge of the snr shell , whose center is located toward the left bottom side of this image .",
    "stil & irwin ( 2001 ) first suggested that cloud 2 is associated with the approaching ( blueshifted ) side of the shell based on the coincidence of the sky position and the line - of - sight velocities ( @xmath28 km s@xmath19 for @xmath1co and @xmath29 km s@xmath19 for ) . because the radial velocities of co and clouds are consistent with that for the region ( @xmath30 km s@xmath19 from fabry - perot h@xmath12 imaging ; de geus et al .",
    "1993 ) , it is highly likely that , co , and the region are associated with each other at the same distance from us .",
    "the radial velocity of the visible mr-1 was measured at and this high velocity is also quite consistent with the velocities of the warm and cold gas components . some runaway ob stars with this velocity",
    "have been observed in the i per ob association ( mclachlan & nandy 1985 ) , which is associated with the foreground perseus arm but relatively close to cloud 2 on the sky with an angular distance of about 35 degrees .",
    "however , because most of the ob stars in the association have @xmath31 to @xmath32 km s@xmath19 , which is the typical velocity for the perseus arm , it would be quite safe to say that mr-1 , with a much higher velocity , is associated with cloud 2 , which is located far beyond the perseus arm .",
    "we can therefore conclude that all those objects in figure [ fig : f4 ] ( from cloud to the nir clusters ) are associated each other at the same distance .",
    "de geus et al . ( 1993 ) found that the three intensity maxima of the h@xmath12 ( in their fig .",
    "3 ) , which are shown with squares in figure 4 , match well with the extended features of 1.4 ghz continuum , which strongly support the suggestion by stil & irwin ( 2001 ) that the radio continuum is coincident with the region in this star - forming region .",
    "the radio continuum emissions extend from near the co cloud to the east toward mr-1 ( open star mark ) .",
    "this suggests that region is excited by mr-1 and partly by the irs sources ( filled green star marks ) .",
    "we have also noticed that one more strong radio continuum peak is located just 12 arcmin south of the cloud 2-n cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] ) .",
    "this strong peak is not seen in the h@xmath12 images by de geus et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; rather , their image shows a local minimum of the h@xmath12 emission near this radio continuum peak .",
    "therefore , the gas of this extended radio continuum feature may be located _ behind _ the co cloud , which should hide the accompanying h@xmath12 emission by strong dust extinction .",
    "this view is consistent with the fact that all the stars in the cloud 2-n cluster are behind the co cloud with a uniform extinction of we are seeing the cloud 2-n cluster and the emission feature through the moderately thick molecular cloud . unlike the cloud 2-n",
    ", the cloud 2-s does not seem to be under the strong influence of the photoionization by mr-1 and/or the bright nir sources .",
    "figure [ fig : f5 ] shows cloud 2 and the cloud members on the iras 60@xmath33 m image as well as the emission contour of the snr shell . an extended iras source , iras 02450 + 5816 , which is bright at 60 and 100@xmath33 m , is located between mr-1 and cloud 2-n and was identified as a photodissociation region formed by mr-1 and/or irs 1 ( kobayashi & tokunaga 2000 ) .",
    "the cloud 2-s cluster is in the vicinity of an unresolved iras source iras 02447 + 5811 , which is bright only in 60@xmath33 m ( see table 2 in kobayashi & tokunaga 2000 ) and is most likely related to the relatively hotter dust around the bright yso in the center of the cloud 2-s cluster .",
    "there might be some contribution to the iras flux of iras 02447 + 5811 from other bright isolated ysos , irs 4 and 5 , because its iras 60@xmath33 m image appears to extend slightly toward those bright isolated ysos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) .",
    "we have checked mid - infrared images by the msx ( midcourse space experiment ) at 821@xmath33 m , but could not find any clear counterpart to the cloud 2-n and 2-s clusters as well as the bright isolated ysos .",
    "although the very extended 60@xmath33 m features at the top of figure [ fig : f5 ] are accompanied mostly by unrelated foreground clouds and star - forming regions , some of the features ( like the filamentary feature just outside the shell delineated by the dashed white line ) might be related to the shell .",
    "the co cloud has an arc shape ( figs . 1 , [ fig : f4 ] , and [ fig : f5 ] ) that is well aligned with the snr shell gsh 138 - 01 - 94 and open toward the center of the shell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) , showing that the co cloud is clearly affected by the snr shell .",
    "the clusters are associated with the two densest co peaks of cloud 2 , and the sharp co contours from the cluster toward the center of the snr shell ( fig .",
    "1 ; suggest that the compression of molecular gas triggered the star formation . in cloud 2-n",
    ", the cluster is associated with the northeastern subpeak , which appears to be more strongly compressed in the expansion direction than the southwestern subpeak , which does not harbor any clear star formation activity .",
    "stil & irwin ( 2001 ) concluded that the expanding shell , gsh 138 - 01 - 94 , was formed by a supernova because of the nonexistence of any ob association inside the shell .",
    "although there is no conclusive evidence for the supernova explosion itself , as there is for the nearby snr shells with radio continuum and x - ray emission , this interpretation appears to be quite solid in view of the observed properties , e.g. , the perfectly spherical shell with a very large diameter that can survive only in a very low gas density environment with little or no perturbation from other objects .",
    "stil & irwin ( 2001 ) suggested that cloud 2 is associated with the approaching ( blueshifted ) side of the shell based on the coincidence of the sky position ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) and the line - of - sight velocities ( @xmath28 km s@xmath19 for @xmath1co and @xmath29 km s@xmath19 for , while the center velocity of the expanding shell is @xmath34 km s@xmath19 ) .",
    "recently , concluded that the snr shell has interacted with cloud 2 based on extensively observed and modeled molecular chemistry for cloud 2 .",
    "suggest that the chemistry of cloud 2 is a direct result of shock fronts from the snr shell propagating through the cloud sometime between @xmath35 years ago ( see chapter 13 of ruffle 2006 ) . at the eog",
    ", there is also no confusion with other objects because there is no complex star formation history and there is very low gas density and little perturbation from the spiral arms .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the shell and the molecular cloud are closely associated .      the steep co contour on the inner side of the snr shell for both cloud 2-n and 2-s ( figs",
    ". 1 and [ fig : f4 ] ) strongly suggests that the compression of the molecular cloud was brought on by the shell expansion .",
    "some portion of the compression could be produced by the stellar wind from the formation of the first star , mr-1 , as a secondary process of the supernova explosion .",
    "the region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] ) , which extends in and around cloud 2-n , clearly shows that at least cloud 2-n is strongly affected by mr-1 .",
    "however , cloud 2-s does not have either an associated h@xmath12/radio continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] ) or pdr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) , which suggests that cloud 2-s was compressed purely by the snr shell .",
    "if the passage of the snr shell has triggered the cluster formation in cloud 2 , the upper - limit of the age of the cluster can be estimated from the projected angular difference of the cluster from the current snr shell front .",
    "figure [ fig : f6 ] shows that the projected angular difference is about 300 arcsec . because the radius of the snr shell ( 2238 arcsec ) and its age is estimated at myr for our assumed distance @xmath36 kpc ( see discussion in  [ subsec : sequential star formation ] ) , the projected angular difference suggests that the cluster is younger than 300/2238 @xmath17 .",
    "although the shell expansion speed is expected to decline with time , that only shortens the upper - limit .",
    "therefore , the age upper - limit of myr still holds .",
    "it is very interesting to note that this age estimate is in quite good agreement with an independent age estimate of cloud 2-n cluster by yasui et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who estimated the age of the cluster at about 0.5 myr from the modeling of the @xmath15-band luminosity function .",
    "this consistency strongly supports the idea that the cluster formation was basically triggered by the snr .",
    "the two embedded clusters show a distinct morphology difference : the one in the northern molecular cloud core is a loose association with an isolated star formation mode , while the other in the southern molecular cloud core is a dense cluster with cluster star formation mode . because the cloud mass of both cloud 2-n and 2-s are similar ( @xmath05 @xmath37 ; assuming the kinematic distance of @xmath38 kpc ( @xmath3 kpc ) .",
    "the presented number was converted from the original estimate assuming the distance of @xmath36 kpc ( @xmath39 kpc ) . ]",
    "digel et al . 1994 ; ) , the difference in the appearance of the two clusters may give us a good opprotunity to study what causes the differences between the two star formation modes .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f7 ] we note that cloud 2-n is distributed along the tangential direction of the snr shell , while cloud 2-s extends slightly inward . a close investigation of the snr shell in a velocity range similar to that of the co clouds ( @xmath40 to @xmath41 km s@xmath19 ) , revealed that another shell - like structure is associated with cloud 2-s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f8 ] ) .",
    "this substructure in the map can be also seen in the velocity channel map at @xmath42 km s@xmath19 in figure 1 in stil & irwin ( 2001 ) .",
    "we denote it as cavity 2b since it encompasses cavity 2 in the stil & irwin paper .",
    "a closer look at the molecular cloud ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] ) shows that the southern half of cloud 2 appears to be perturbed by cavity 2b at around ( ra@xmath43 , dec@xmath43)=(2@xmath4448@xmath4530@xmath46 , 58@xmath4726@xmath48 ) .",
    "we also found that both embedded clusters in cloud 2 ( cloud 2-s cluster and the irs 3 mini - cluster ) are located on the western side of the cloud cores ( see the distribution of red crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] ) .",
    "this appears to imply that the shock from the western side , presumably from cavity 2b , caused the star formation in cloud 2-s .",
    "therefore , we propose that _",
    "strong compressions _ of cloud 2-s from the combination of the snr shell and cavity 2b caused the cluster - mode star formation whereas an isolated - mode star formation occurred in cloud 2-n",
    ". this may be one of the best examples that clearly supports the theoretical and observational suggestions that high - pressure is the trigger of cluster - mode star formation ( e.g. , elmegreen 1998 , 2004 ) .",
    "the center of cavity 2b is at about ( l , b ) = ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) or ( ra@xmath43 , dec@xmath43 ) = ( 02@xmath4446@xmath4553@xmath46 , + 58@xmath4723@xmath48 ) with a radius of about 12@xmath48 ( about 45 pc ) . cavity 2b could be either a smaller ( thus , younger ) adjacent snr shell or a hole on the snr shell like cavity 1 and 2 in stil & irwin ( 2001 ) .",
    "although cavity 1 appears to be a hole on the snr shell rather than another snr shell ( stil & irwin 2001 ) , we confirmed a sign of an expanding shell for cavity 2b in an position - velocity map made with the cgps data . because we could not identify any radio continuum source inside cavity 2b using the nvss map ( vla 1.4 ghz ) ,",
    "cavity 2b does not seem to be powered by star - forming regions , and it could be another young snr shell .",
    "figure [ fig : f9 ] summarizes our interpretation of the star formation history in cloud 2 .",
    "the first - generation star ( mr-1 ) and second - generation stars ( the bright nir sources ) do not seem to accompany a cluster like that for the third - generation stars in cloud 2-n and 2-s clusters .",
    "this may suggest that those early generation stars were born in an isolated mode without accompanying clusters .",
    "although the ages of the clusters were estimated at @xmath00.5 myr ( see discussion in  4.2 ) , it is hard to determine when those early generation high- to intermediate - mass stars were born . in view of their possible locations inside the snr sphere (",
    "the projected distance from the shell center to the stars is about 75% of the shell radius ) , their ages should not be more than 2 myr in view of the age of the snr shell ( ) even after considering the slowing down of the shell expansion .",
    "this probable age for the second generation bright nir sources is consistent with our interpretation that they are herbig ae / be stars , whose typical ages are 0.1 to a few myrs ( van den ancker et al .",
    "the probable age of @xmath512 myr is also consistent with the first generation star , mr-1 , which is most likely in the main - sequence phase in view of its very short pre - main - sequence timescale ( @xmath00.1 myr ; bernasconi & maeder 1996 ) for the large mass ( @xmath020 @xmath52 ) .",
    "most of the red sources scattered in the field in figure 1 are background galaxies , although some of them might be stars formed with the first and second generation high / intermediate - mass stars .",
    "note that the faint companions of the bright nir stars , irs 4 and 5 , are distributed to the west .",
    "this might show the trace of the progressive star formation : first bright intermediate - mass stars were born , then the low - mass stars just to the west formed from the remaining cloud .",
    "future kinematical study of all those cloud members with nir echelle spectroscopy may shed light on the dynamical processes that happened during the triggered star formation .",
    "ferguson , gallagher , & wyse ( 1998 ) have pointed out that the outskirts of spiral galaxies in the local universe have the characteristics similar to high - redshift damped lyman-@xmath12 systems as well as to giant low surface brightness galaxies in that they have low gas surface densities ( yet high gas fractions compared to stars ) , low metallicities , and long dynamical timescales .",
    "the irregular ( i m ) dwarf galaxies , which are generally dominated in the optical by their younger stellar populations , also have the similar characteristics ( hunter et al .",
    "they are usually lower in luminosity and surface brightness , more gas - rich with a lower metallicity and dust content , and form stars without the benefit of spiral density waves .",
    "all these characteristics suggest that the irregular dwarf galaxies are representative of the nature of star formation in the early universe ( hunter et al .",
    "2006 ; hunter & elmegreen 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "however , the distance to the nearest i m galaxy ( lmc ) is 50 kpc , while the distance to the eog is 1020 kpc .",
    "the proximity of the eog enables us to resolve star cluster members with ground - based seeing resolution ( see yasui et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) and spectroscopic study is also possible with the 8-meter class telescopes even for low - mass stars ( e.g. , down to @xmath53 to 20 mag ) . the gas content can be also studied in detail statistically ( snell et al . 2002 ) and with various molecular lines ( lubowich et al .",
    "2004 ; ruffle et al .",
    "2005 ; brand & wouterloot 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , the eog is an excellent place to study the star formation processes that were present during the early epoch of galaxy formation and that are still present in i m galaxies ( hunter et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the metallicity of outer galaxy disks , i m galaxies , low - metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies ( kunth & ostlin 2000 ) , and damped lyman-@xmath12 systems are observed down to [ fe / h ] @xmath54 ( e.g. , pettini 2004 ) .",
    "this metallicity range traces the critical phases of early galaxy formation when the major components , such as halo , thick disk , bulge , and thin disk , formed ( e.g. , fig . 3 in buser 2000 ; freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "the typical metallicity of the outer galaxy regions ( @xmath55 [ fe / h ] @xmath56 ) suggest that they represent the late phase of halo formation and the early phase of thick disk formation . despite many extensive studies ( e.g. , bensby et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) , the origin and role of the thick disk in our galaxy are not well understood even decades after its discovery ( gilmore & reid 1983 ) . although the study of abundance patterns recorded in very low metallicity stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath57 ) provides a vital clue to the star formation process in the very early epoch of galaxy formation ( audouze & silk 1995 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ; tsujimoto & shigeyama 1998 ) , this successful `` archeological method '' can not be applied to the metallicity range of the thick disk because the abundance patterns of the formed stars are significantly affected by the galactic global chemical evolution of the interstellar medium , from which the stars are formed .",
    "the observational study of the outer galaxy region may directly reveal the details of the star formation process during the formation of the thick disk , which took place at @xmath58 ( @xmath010 gyr ago ) , to shed light on the origin and role of this important galactic component .    in the last decade ,",
    "the formation of population iii stars ( the `` first stars '' ) has been extensively studied theoretically ( abel , brian & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2001 ) not only for its own sake , but because of its direct relation to the reionization of the early universe and galaxy formation at an early epoch ( see , e.g. , yoshida 2006 ) .",
    "the recent advancement in the study of the extreme metal - poor stars ( christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ; beers & christlieb 2005 ) , which are the potential relics of the pop iii stars , boosted the examination of early - phase galaxy formation through the study of abundance patterns recorded in very low metallicity stars at a very early epoch .",
    "although theoretical studies suggest that the star formation physics in the metallicity range of the outer galaxy regions should not significantly differ from that for the solar metallicity ( e.g. , omukai 2000 ) , the observational study of the regions in this `` niche '' metallicity range establishes a good link between very low and solar metallicity ranges , thereby revealing important astronomical processes in this metallicity range .",
    "it is most likely that sn - triggered star formation was the major process by which stars formed in the early epoch of galaxy formation because of the lack of other major star formation triggers such as density waves in spiral galaxies .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of active star formation in digel s cloud 2 , which is one of the most distant giant molecular clouds known in the extreme outer galaxy ( eog ) . at the probable galactic radius of @xmath020 kpc , </S>",
    "<S> cloud 2 has a quite different environment from that in the solar neighborhood , including lower metallicity , much lower gas density , and small or no perturbation from spiral arms . with new wide - field near - infrared ( nir ) imaging that covers the entire cloud 2 </S>",
    "<S> , we discovered two young embedded star clusters located in the two dense cores of the cloud . using our nir and @xmath1co data as well as , radio continuum , and iras data in the archives , we discuss the detailed star formation processes in this unique environment . </S>",
    "<S> we show clear evidences of a sequential star formation triggered by the nearby huge supernova remnant , gsh 138 - 01 - 94 . </S>",
    "<S> the two embedded clusters show a distinct morphology difference : the one in the northern molecular cloud core is a loose association with isolated - mode star formation , while the other in the southern molecular cloud core is a dense cluster with cluster - mode star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that high compression by the combination of the snr shell and an adjacent shell caused the dense cluster formation in the southern core . along with the low metallicity range of the eog </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that eog could be an excellent laboratory for the study of star formation processes , such as those triggered by supernovae , that occured during an early epoch of the galaxy s formation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the study of the eog may shed light on the origin and role of the thick disk , whose metallicity range matches with that of the eog well . </S>"
