    "most co - based heusler compounds in the cubic l2@xmath1 structure are ferromagnetic with a high curie temperature and a large saturation magnetization.@xcite furthermore , many of them were predicted to be half - metallic@xcite and hence are of particular interest for spintronics .",
    "therefore , the electronic band structure and magnetic properties of the co - based heusler compounds have been intensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in recent years@xcite . for example , the total magnetic moments of these materials were found to follow the slater - pauling type behavior and the mechanism was explained in terms of the calculated electronic structures@xcite .",
    "the curie temperatures of co - based heulser compounds were also determined from _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations and the trends were related to the electronic structures@xcite .",
    "half - metallic ferromagnets are characterized by the coexistence of metallic behavior for one spin channel and insulating behavior for the other , and their electronic density of states at the fermi level is completely spin polarized .",
    "thus , they could in principle offer a fully spin - polarized current and are useful for spin electronic devices .",
    "the possible half - metallicity of the co - based heusler compounds has been intensively investigated experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "in particular , many point - contact andreev reflection ( pcar ) experiments@xcite have been carried out on co@xmath0fesi and its current spin polarization ( @xmath2 ) was found to vary from 45 % to 60 % , depending on the substrate and the quality of the contact .",
    "a higher @xmath2 of @xmath480 % was reported in a nonlocal spin valve ( nlsv ) experiment@xcite on co@xmath0fesi .",
    "the spin hall effect experiment@xcite showed that the @xmath2 of co@xmath0fesi is positive .",
    "however , the measured positive current spin polarization is at odds with the predictions of the negative spin polarization of the electronic states at the fermi level ( static spin polarization ) ( @xmath5 ) from the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations@xcite with the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the calculated spin magnetic moment ( @xmath9 ) was found to differ by nearly 10 % from the measured total magnetic moment ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath46 @xmath7/f.u.@xcite it was argued that the co - based heusler compounds are strongly correlated systems and hence should be better described by , e.g. , the lda / gga plus onsite coulomb repulsion ( @xmath8 ) ( lda / gga+@xmath8 ) approach@xcite .",
    "the gga+@xmath8 calculations@xcite indeed would give rise to a @xmath9 of 6 @xmath7/f.u . and",
    "a positive @xmath5 of 100 % ( i.e. , being half - metallic ) .",
    "however , the calculated @xmath5 is much larger than the measured spin polarization . nevertheless , as pointed out recently in ref .",
    ", the spin polarization measured in transport experiments such as pcar and nlsv experiments should be compared with the theoretical current spin polarization ( @xmath2 ) rather than static spin polarization ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , one of the principal purposes of this work is to understand the measured spin polarization in all the co@xmath0fex compounds by performing a systematic _ ab initio _ gga study of both the current and static spin polarizations as well as the total magnetic moment in these compounds .",
    "indeed , we find that the calculated @xmath2 values for the co@xmath0fex compounds agree with the available experimental results not only in sign but also in magnitude , while the calculated @xmath5 values for co@xmath0fex ( x = si , ge and sn ) are wrong even in sign .",
    "the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) , discovered in 1881 by hall@xcite , is an archetypal spin - related transport phenomenon and hence has recently received renewed attention@xcite . indeed , many _ ab initio _ studies on the ahe in elemental ferromagnets@xcite and intermetallic alloys@xcite have recently been reported . however ,",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "investigations into the ahe in the heusler compounds have been few@xcite .",
    "interestingly , co@xmath0mnx ( x = al , ga and in ) were recently predicted@xcite to have a large intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity ( ahc ) in the order of @xmath41000 s / cm , and thus could find applications in magnetization sensors@xcite . therefore , another principal purpose of this work is to understand the ahe in all the co@xmath0fe - based heusler compounds and the results may help experimental search for the heusler compounds with large ahe for applications . furthermore , by comparison of the calculated ahc as well as the current spin polarization and total magnetic moment with the measured ones , one could have a comprehensive assessment of whether or not the co@xmath0fex compounds are strongly correlated systems that would require the gga+@xmath8 approach .    in nonmagnetic materials where the numbers of the spin - up and spin - down electrons are equal",
    ", the opposite transverse currents caused by the applied electric field would result in a pure spin current , and this is known as the intrinsic spin hall effect ( she).@xcite the pure spin current is dissipationless@xcite and is thus important for the development of low energy - consumption nanoscale spintronic devices@xcite .",
    "we note that high spin - polarization ( @xmath2 ) of the charge current ( @xmath11 ) from the electrode is essential for large giant magnetoresistance ( gmr)@xcite and tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr)@xcite .",
    "however , since the current - induced magnetization switching results from the transfer of spin angular momentum from the current carriers to the magnet@xcite , large spin current ( @xmath12 ) would be needed for the operation of the spin - torque switching - based nanodevices@xcite , i.e. , a large ratio of spin current to charge current [ @xmath13 , would be crucial . for ordinary charge currents",
    ", this ratio @xmath14 varies from 0.0 ( spin unpolarized current ) to 1.0 ( fully spin polarized current ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath14 can be larger than 1.0 for the hall currents and is @xmath15 for pure spin current .",
    "fascinatingly , spin - torque switching of ferromagnets driven by pure spin current from large she in tantalum has been recently reported@xcite .",
    "therefore , it might be advantageous to use the hall current from ferromagnets for magnetoelectronic devices , rather than the longitudinal current .",
    "another purpose of this work is therefore to investigate the nature and spin - polarization of the hall current in the co@xmath0fe - based heusler compounds for possible spintronic applications .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the theories of the intrinsic anomalous and spin hall conductivities as well as hall and longitudinal current spin polarizations .",
    "we will also introduce the full - potential relativistic band theoretical method used and give the computional details . in sec .",
    "iii , the calculated magnetic moments , intrinsic hall conductivities and current spin polarizations of all the studied co@xmath0fex compounds will be reported in subsections iii ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the theoretical results will be analyzed in terms of the underlying band structures and also compared with the available experimental ones . in subsection",
    "iii ( d ) , the results from the gga+@xmath8 calculations will be presented to examine the effect of including the semi - empirical on - site coulomb interaction on the calculated physical properties of the co@xmath0fex compounds .",
    "finally , conclusions drawn from this work will be given in sec .",
    "we first perform the self - consistent electronic structure calculations for the co@xmath0fex compounds within the density functional theory with the gga for the exchange correlation potential@xcite .",
    "since all the intrinsic hall effects are caused by the relativistic electron spin - orbit interaction , the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is included in the present _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we use the highly accurate full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method , as implemented in the wien2k code@xcite .",
    "the wave function , charge density , and potential were expanded in terms of the spherical harmonics inside the muffin - tin spheres and the cutoff angular moment ( @xmath16 ) used is 10 , 6 and 6 , respectively . the wave function outside the muffin - tin spheres is expanded in terms of the augmented plane waves ( apws ) and a large number of apws ( about 70 apws per atom , i. e. , the maximum size of the crystal momentum @xmath17 ) were included in the present calculations . the improved tetrahedron method is used for the brillouin - zone integration@xcite . to obtain accurate ground state charge density as well as spin and orbital magnetic moments , a fine 27@xmath1827@xmath1827 grid with 1470 @xmath19-points in the irreducible brillouin zone wedge ( ibzw ) is used .",
    "the self - consistent cycles were terminated when the integrated charge density variation became less than @xmath20 e.    we consider the co@xmath0fex heusler compounds in the fully ordered cubic l2@xmath1 structure .",
    "the available experimental lattice constants@xcite are used for all the considered co@xmath0fex ( x = al , ga , in , si , ge , sn ) heusler alloys except co@xmath0feal@xmath3si@xmath3 , co@xmath0fein and co@xmath0fesn , as listed in table i. since the experimental lattice constant for co@xmath0fein is not available , we determine the lattice constant for co@xmath0fein theoretically , also by using the flapw method , as described in the preceding paragraph .",
    "we also study the l2@xmath1 co@xmath0feal@xmath3si@xmath3 alloy and model it by the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) , i.e. , the al / si site is occupied by a virtual atom with the atom number @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the al and si atomic numbers , respectively .",
    "the lattice constant of 5.689  , which is the average of the experimental lattice constants of co@xmath0feal ( 5.737  ) and co@xmath0fesi ( 5.640  ) , is used for co@xmath0feal@xmath3si@xmath3 because the lattice constant of the co@xmath0feal@xmath24si@xmath25 alloy was reported to depend linearly on the al concentration ( @xmath26)@xcite . note that in fact we have determined the lattice constants theoretically also for the co@xmath0fex ( x = al , ga , si , ge ) compounds .",
    "the theoretical lattice constants for these compounds differ from the experimental values by less than 1 % . as a result ,",
    "the physical properties of these compounds calculated using the experimental and theoretical lattice constants differ only slightly .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we present only the physical properties of these compounds calculated using the experimental lattice constants in the next section .",
    "however , the theoretical lattice constant ( 6.013  ) of co@xmath0fesn is 2.4 % larger than the experimental one ( 5.87 )@xcite perhaps because the prepared co@xmath0fesn films contained only a low degree of l2@xmath1 order .",
    "therefore , the theoretical lattice constant is used for co@xmath0fesn ( table i ) .",
    "the intrinsic anomalous and spin hall conductivities of a solid can be evaluated by using the kubo formalism.@xcite here we first calculate the imaginary part of the off - diagonal elements of the optical conductivity .",
    "then we obtain the real part of the off - diagonal elements from the imaginary part by a kramers - kronig transformation .",
    "the intrinsic ahc ( @xmath27 ) is the static limit of the off - diagonal element of the optical conductivity @xmath28 .",
    "if we now replace the charge current operator @xmath29 with the spin current operator @xmath30 and repeat the calculation@xcite , we will obtain the intrinsic spin hall conductivity ( shc ) ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we note in passing that alternatively , one could also calculate @xmath27 ( @xmath31 ) by an integration of the ( spin ) berry curvature over the brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the two methods were found to be numerically equivalent@xcite .",
    "a dense @xmath19 point mesh would be needed for obtaining accurate ahc and shc@xcite .",
    "therefore , we use several fine @xmath19-point meshes with the finest @xmath19-point mesh being 58@xmath1858@xmath1858 which has 8125 @xmath19-points in the ibzw . we calculate the ahc and shc as a function of the number ( @xmath32 ) of @xmath19-points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the calculated ahc ( @xmath27 ) and shc ( @xmath31 ) versus the inverse of the @xmath32 are then plotted and fitted to a polynomial to get the converged theoretical @xmath27 and @xmath31 ( i.e. , the extrapolated value at @xmath33 ) ( see refs . and ) .",
    "furthermore , to ensure that the @xmath28 via the kramers - kronig transformation is accurate , the energy bands up to 5.5 ry are included in the calculation of @xmath34 .      the spin polarization of a magnetic material is usually described in terms of the spin - decomposed densities of states ( doss ) at the fermi level ( @xmath35 ) as follows @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the spin - up and spin - down doss at the @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "this static spin polarization @xmath39 would then vary from -1.0 to 1.0 only .",
    "for the half - metallic materials , @xmath39 equals to either -1.0 or 1.0 .",
    "as mentioned above , the spin polarization @xmath5 defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) is not necessarily the spin polarization of the transport currents measured in experiments .",
    "indeed , the spin - polarizations measured by using different experimental techniques could differ significantly@xcite . from the viewpoint of spintronic applications , only the current spin polarization instead of the @xmath5 , counts .",
    "therefore , in this work , we further calculate the spin polarization of both the longitudinal and hall currents , as described below . here , we calculate the longitudinal electric conductivities ( @xmath40 ) for spin - up and spin - down electrons divided by the corresponding drude relaxation times ( @xmath41 ) ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) within the semi - classical boltzmann transport theory , as implemented in boltztrap code@xcite . in the present calculations , the relaxation time is assumed to be independent of energy , @xmath19-point and spin direction ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "consequently , we can obtain the longitudinal current spin polarization @xmath2 from @xmath44 the underlying scalar - relativistic band structures are calculated by using a fine 36@xmath1836@xmath1836 mesh with 3349 @xmath19-points in the ibzw .    the spin polarization @xmath45 of the hall current may be written as@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the spin - up and spin - down hall conductivities , respectively .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath49 can be obtained from the calculated ahc and shc via the relations@xcite @xmath50 @xmath51 note that , the absolute value of @xmath45 can be greater than 1.0 because the spin - decomposed hall currents can go either right ( positive ) or left ( negative ) . in the nonmagnetic materials , the charge hall current is zero , and hence , @xmath47",
    "@xmath52 @xmath53 results in @xmath45@xmath54 .",
    "clearly , in the case of hall currents , the ratio of the spin current to charge current @xmath55 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to examine the effect of on - site coulomb interaction , we further perform the calculations in the gga+@xmath8 scheme@xcite .",
    "the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath8(exchange interaction @xmath56 ) used are 2.82 ( 0.9 ) and 2.6 ( 0.8 ) ev for co and fe , respectively , which are widely used for co@xmath0-based heusler compounds.@xcite the results from these gga+@xmath8 calculations are compared with those of the gga calculations in table iii .",
    "we notice that the total spin magnetic moments ( @xmath9 ) from the gga and gga+@xmath8 calculations are almost identical in all the heusler compounds except co@xmath0fesi and co@xmath0fege .",
    "this may be expected since the gga @xmath9 is already nearly saturated in these compounds . including the on - site coulomb interaction increases the @xmath9 in co@xmath0fesi and co@xmath0fege to the saturation values .",
    "note that the measured magnetic moments should be compared with the calculated total magnetic moments ( @xmath10 ) instead of total spin magnetic moments ( @xmath9 ) in tables i and iii .",
    "the @xmath10 contains both the @xmath9 and the total orbital magnetic moment which can not be neglected in the heusler compounds studied here because the orbital magnetic moments on the fe and co atoms are rather significant ( table i ) .",
    "tables i and iii together show that including the on - site coulomb interaction actually increases the small discrepancies between the experiments and the gga calculations found in all the heusler compounds except co@xmath0fesi where the difference of 0.3 @xmath7/f.u . is reduced slightly to 0.2 @xmath7 per formula unit .",
    "table iii shows that the on - site coulomb interaction has a pronounced effect on the spin polarization .",
    "first , the current spin polarization ( @xmath2 ) for all the studied compounds is now 100 % from the gga+@xmath8 calculations .",
    "second , the static spin polarization ( @xmath5 ) approaches to 100% for all the compounds except co@xmath0fega .",
    "therefore , these heusler compounds become half - metals in terms of both the band structure and current spin polarization .",
    "this may be expected because the main effect of the on - site coulomb interaction is to raise the spin - down fe and co @xmath57-dominant conduction bands .",
    "consequently , if sufficiently large @xmath8 values are used , the spin - down fe and co @xmath57-dominant conduction bands will move to above @xmath35 .",
    "this will open a gap in the spin - down channel and thus give rise to zero spin - down dos at @xmath35 ( table iii ) .",
    "however , the spin - down gga+@xmath8 band gap is as large as 0.9 ev in co@xmath0fesi , for example , being nearly 100 times larger than the measured one@xcite . interestingly , including coulomb @xmath8 changes the spin polarization @xmath5 in co@xmath0fesi and co@xmath0fege from negative to positive ( table iii ) .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the mechanism of the spin polarization sign change here is very different from the sign difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath2 in the gga calculations .",
    "nevertheless , whether the @xmath5 is positive or negative can be tested by spin - polarized angle - resolved photoemission experiments which , unfortunately , have not been reported on any heusler compound studied here .",
    "table iii also indicates that including the on - site coulomb @xmath8 changes the calculated ahc and shc substantially .",
    "in particular , the @xmath27 gets reduced significantly for all the studied compounds except co@xmath0feal ( table iii ) .",
    "for example , the theoretical @xmath27 for co@xmath0fege is 119 s / cm from the gga calculation but is reduced to 14 s / cm when the on - site coulomb @xmath8 is included .",
    "this suggests that by comparing the calculated @xmath27 with the measured one , one could assess whether or not including on - site coulomb @xmath8 is needed to properly describe the electronic properties of a co@xmath0fe - based heusler compound .",
    "the measured @xmath27 of co@xmath0fesi@xcite is @xmath4160 s / cm , being in good agreement with the gga result ( table ii ) .",
    "however , it is two times larger than the result of the gga+@xmath8 calculation ( about 70 s / cm ) .",
    "this indicates that co@xmath0fe - based heusler compounds are not strongly correlated systems and there may be no need to include the on - site coulomb @xmath8 for these compounds .",
    "we have carried out a systematic _ ab initio _ study of the anomalous hall effect and current spin polarization as well as the magnetic properties of the co@xmath0fex ( x = al , ga , in , si , ge , sn ) heusler compounds in the cubic l2@xmath1 structure by using the highly accurate all - electron flapw method .",
    "first , we find that the spin - polarization of the longitudinal current ( @xmath2 ) in co@xmath0fex ( x = al , ga and al@xmath3si@xmath3 ) is @xmath4100 % even though the static spin polarization ( @xmath5 ) is not . furthermore , the other compounds also have a high current spin polarization with @xmath6 % .",
    "this indicates that all the co@xmath0fex compounds are promising for spintronic devices .",
    "interestingly , @xmath5 is negative in co@xmath0fex ( x = si , ge and sn ) , differing in sign from the @xmath2 as well as from that from the transport experiments .",
    "second , the calculated ahcs are moderate , being within 200 s / cm , and agree well with the available experiments on highly l2@xmath1 ordered co@xmath0fesi specimen although they differ significantly from the reported experiments on other compounds where the b2 antisite disorders were present .",
    "surprisingly , the ahc in co@xmath0fesi decreases and then changes from the negative to positive when si is replaced by ge and finally by sn .",
    "third , the calculated total magnetic moments are in good agreement with the experiments in all the studied compounds except co@xmath0fesi where a difference of 0.3 @xmath7/f.u . exists .",
    "we have also performed the gga+@xmath8 calculations in order to examine the effects of the on - site couloumb repulsion .",
    "we find that including the @xmath8 changes the calculated total magnetic moment , spin polarization and ahc significantly . in most cases , unfortunately , this results in a worse agreement with the available experimental results .",
    "these interesting findings are analyzed in terms of the underlying band structures .",

    "<S> co - based heusler compounds are ferromagnetic with a high curie temperature and a large magnetization density , and thus are promising for spintronic applications . in this paper , we perform a systematic _ ab initio _ study of two principal spin - related phenomena , namely , anomalous hall effect and current spin polarization , in co@xmath0fe - based heusler compounds co@xmath0fex ( x = al , ga , in , si , ge , sn ) in the cubic l2@xmath1 structure within the density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) . the accurate all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method is used . </S>",
    "<S> first , we find that the spin - polarization of the longitudinal current ( @xmath2 ) in co@xmath0fex ( x = al , ga , in , al@xmath3si@xmath3 and sn ) is @xmath4100 % even though that of the electronic states at the fermi level ( @xmath5 ) is not . further , the other compounds also have a high current spin polarization with @xmath6 % . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that all the co@xmath0fex compounds considered are promising for spin - transport devices . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath5 is negative in co@xmath0fex ( x = si , ge and sn ) , differing in sign from the @xmath2 as well as that from the transport experiments . </S>",
    "<S> second , the calculated anomalous hall conductivities ( ahcs ) are moderate , being within 200 s / cm , and agree well with the available experiments on highly l2@xmath1 ordered co@xmath0fesi specimen although they differ significantly from the reported experiments on other compounds where the b2 antisite disorders were present . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the ahc in co@xmath0fesi decreases and then changes sign when si is replaced by ge and finally by sn . </S>",
    "<S> third , the calculated total magnetic moments agree well with the corresponding experimental ones in all the studied compounds except co@xmath0fesi where a difference of 0.3 @xmath7/f.u </S>",
    "<S> . exists . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform the gga plus on - site coulomb interaction @xmath8 calculations in the gga+@xmath8 scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we find that including the @xmath8 affects the calculated total magnetic moment , spin polarization and ahc significantly , and in most cases , unfortunately , results in a disagreement with the available experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> all these interesting findings are discussed in terms of the underlying band structures . </S>"
