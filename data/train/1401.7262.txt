    "the capacity ( [ eq : awgneq ] ) is achieved by a sinc pulse and the spectral efficiency is @xmath4    mazo @xcite introduced faster - than - nyquist ( ftn ) signaling for sinc pulses where the pulses are modulated faster than the nyquist rate . the resulting intersymbol interference ( isi ) can be interpreted as a type of coding @xcite and is the same as correlative or partial response signaling @xcite such as the duobinary technique .",
    "mazo showed that increasing the modulation rate by up to @xmath5 does not affect the minimum euclidean distance between the closest two signals when using binary antipodal modulation .",
    "thus , the coding induced by ftn signaling increases the spectral efficiency at high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "non - orthogonal transmission schemes such as ftn @xcite , @xcite are receiving renewed attention for their potential to increase capacity .",
    "ftn may also be interesting for applications that need low cost transmitters and flexible rate adaptation .    in practice , it is difficult to approximate sinc pulses .",
    "one instead often analyzes square root raised cosine ( rrc ) pulses that decay more quickly than sinc pulses and can be approximated more accurately .",
    "rusek , anderson and wall show in @xcite and @xcite that ftn signaling achieves a substantially higher spectral efficiency than ( [ eq : spec_awgn ] ) if the comparison is based on the 3-db power bandwidth of rrc pulses with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "the calculations are performed for a single channel , i.e. , there is no interference or spectral sharing .",
    "we revisit this comparison by viewing bandwidth as a shared resource where the spectral efficiency @xmath6 is computed by normalizing the sum rate of @xmath7 users ( or systems ) by an overall bandwidth of approximately @xmath8 hz , where @xmath9 is the bandwidth assigned to each user .",
    "for example , for shannon s sinc pulse , every user receives @xmath10 hz of non - overlapping bandwidth and the spectral efficiency is given by ( [ eq : spec_awgn ] ) .",
    "one may try to improve @xmath6 by using non - orthogonal signaling such as ftn .",
    "of course , now the users experience interference .",
    "our main goal is to explore the spectral efficiency of ftn signaling from the shared resource perspective .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] analyzes the capacity of ftn signaling for a single user , section [ sec3 ] defines and analyzes spectral efficiency for a multiaccess channel with spectrum sharing , and section [ sec4 ] discusses the results further for low and high snr .",
    "the nyquist _ rate _ usually refers to twice the bandwidth of a bandlimited signal .",
    "the nyquist intersymbol interference ( isi ) _ criterion _ refers to the requirement that sampling at regular intervals incurs no isi @xcite . for sinc pulses ,",
    "nyquist - rate sampling satisfies the nyquist isi criterion , so that ftn refers to sampling faster than both the nyquist rate _ and _ a nyquist isi criterion rate .",
