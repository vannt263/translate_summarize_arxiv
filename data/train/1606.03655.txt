    "massive stars love company , and it seems that more than 90% of massive stars are formed in binaries ( sana et al .",
    "2014 ) , with a majority of them interacting during their lives ( sana et al .",
    "these interactions could take the form of mergers , roche lobe overflow and accretion , or wind interactions through wind - wind collisions ( wwcs ) when both stars are evolved and have strong winds .",
    "wwcs are best known in wolf - rayet@xmath2o binaries , which occur quite frequently and with dramatic effects . in such systems ,",
    "we observe hot , dense stellar winds , high terminal wind speeds , and phase - dependent shock cones through studies of spectral line excesses , x - ray light curves and spectroscopy , non - thermal radio emission , and dust production in some cases ( e.g. moffat 1998 ) .",
    "one classical example of these colliding - wind wr@xmath2o binaries is the wc7pd@xmath2o5.5fc system wr 140 ( fahed et al . 2011 ; monnier et al . 2011 ) , with an orbital period of 7.94 yr and a high eccentricity of 0.88 .",
    "the denser wr wind pushes back the o star wind to form a shock cone with a half opening angle @xmath3 , which wraps around the system in successive orbits .",
    "wwcs are occasionally observed in o@xmath2o binaries , but with correspondingly lower excess emission fluxes .",
    "@xmath0  car is a massive , evolved binary residing in the nearby ( @xmath4  kpc ; smith 2006 ) carina nebula and star - forming region .",
    "it has been well - studied , being the subject of a hubble treasury program for spatially resolved spectroscopy , while also being observed with ground - based telescopes .",
    "recent studies have allowed state - of - the - art observations and theory to meet , providing constraints on the orbital , stellar , and wind parameters of the system , and our understanding of massive star wwcs .",
    "the secondary star has eluded observers since the discovery of the binary nature of the system and the 5.54-yr periodicities ( damineli et al .",
    "1997 , 2008 ) .",
    "the wwc is dramatic because of the lower terminal wind speed , @xmath5 ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath7 ; hillier et al .",
    "2001 ) and higher mass - loss rate of the primary ( @xmath8  @xmath9  yr@xmath7 ; groh et al .",
    "2012a ) compared to typical wr@xmath2o systems .",
    "the secondary star has wind parameters indicative of either a wr or extreme o star , with the strongest constraints coming from the x - ray analysis ( pittard & corcoran 2002 ; parkin et al .",
    "2009 ) , which points to @xmath10  @xmath9  yr@xmath7 and @xmath11  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "@xmath0  carhas a high eccentricity ( @xmath12 ) and an orbital period of 5.54 yr , and many observational phenomena are modulated on this time - scale , such as the x - ray emission ( corcoran 2005 , corcoran et al .",

    "( _ hst _ ) and space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "the more recent 2009 periastron passage was observed in the optical only with ground - based facilities due to a failure of the stis that was repaired during servicing mission 4 , after the 2009 periastron passage .",
    "however , this event brought about one of the most intense ground - based spectroscopic data - sets compiled , both for the he  ii emission ( teodoro et al .",
    "2012 ) , and the optical spectrum and wind transitions ( richardson et al .",
    "2015 ) , including the strong h@xmath13 profile ( richardson et al .",
    "2010 ) that is often saturated in ground - based observations .",
    "the intense time - series collected will allow for many future theoretical studies about the detailed system parameters .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations of @xmath0  car s binary colliding winds have provided crucial insights on the time - dependent geometry and ionization state of the wwcs , helping constrain the binary orientation , wind parameters , and locations where various observed emission and absorption features arise ( okazaki et al .",

    "( 2009 ) using x - ray data .",
    "more importantly , madura et al . (",
    "2012 ) broke the degeneracy inherent to models based solely on x - rays or other spatially - unresolved data and constrained the 3d orientation of the @xmath0  carbinary .",
    "they found that the binary has an argument of periapsis @xmath14 , with the orbital axis closely aligned with the homunculus nebula s polar symmetry axis at an inclination @xmath15 and position angle on the sky @xmath16 , implying that the binary companion star at apastron is on the observer s side of the system and that the companion orbits clockwise on the sky .",

    "groh et al .",
    "( 2010 ) observed the he  i lines of @xmath0 car as it approached its 2009.0 periastron passage , concentrating on the nir transition of he  i @xmath110830 .",
    "a high - velocity absorption component at velocities of @xmath18  km  s@xmath7 or lower was observed between phases 0.976 and 1.023 , which was postulated to originate in the shocked gas from the wwc zone as the trailing arm of the shock cone passes through our line - of - sight . from the spatial scale of these absorption variations and a comparison to 3d models of the colliding winds",
    ", these observations pointed to a wwc at scales of 1545  au from the central binary .",
    "other optical he  i lines examined from the _ hst _ treasury program during the 2003 spectroscopic event ( nielsen et al . 2007 ;",
    "groh et al .",
    "2010 ) show a noticeable high - velocity absorption in the two triplet line profiles of he  i @xmath13888 and @xmath15876 extending to @xmath19  km  s@xmath7 at phase 0.995 .",
    "singlet lines such as he  i @xmath16680 show weaker absorption up to @xmath20  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "however , no visible - wavelength he  i lines showed obvious highly - blueshifted absorptions ( @xmath21 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "this is explainable by the difference in lower levels of the transitions .",
    "the he  i @xmath110830 absorptions originate from the metastable 2s@xmath22 level , but the visible lines are absorbed from levels readily depopulated by permitted transitions .",
    "the interpretation of he i emission in @xmath0  caris still somewhat debated in the literature .",
    "some of the he i emission and absorption can certainly be accounted for by the primary wind ( e.g.  hillier et al .",
    "2001 , groh et al .",
    "this is supported by the presence of extremely similar he  i profiles in the lbv hde 316285 ( hillier et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) , which has no known binary companion .",
    "the spectral modeling of both @xmath0  car and hde 316285 ( hillier et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) can reproduce both stars and show similar properties .",
    "many authors have argued that the he i is related to , but not necessarily coming from , the companion ( see e.g. mehner et al .  2012 , 2015 ) .",
    "this would allow for several variations we observe to be accounted for in the @xmath0  car system .",
    "for example , richardson et al .  (",
    "2015 ) developed a simple cartoon model for the variability of the he  i lines that allows for some fraction of the emission to be formed in an ionised hemisphere of the primary wind facing the secondary star . when coupled with the expected radial velocity variations of the primary",
    ", the model does fairly well at explaining the variations , but future 3d sph models with simplexmight better account for the variability .",
    "the recent 2014.6 spectroscopic event provided observers a fresh look at the variations related to the periastron passage of the system , despite an unfortunate timing for ground - based observatories .",
    "davidson et al .  ( 2015 ) reported a potential cycle - to - cycle change in the he  ii @xmath14686 emission based upon _",
    "hst_/stis measurements , but teodoro et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have compiled a large , extensive dataset with spatial mappings from _",
    "hst_/stis used to correct for differences between ground - based and space - based observations .",
    "the dataset of teodoro et al .",
    "( 2016 ) shows very few changes in the global behaviour of he  ii when compared to the previous four periastron passages observed , but some minor variability is present .",
    "davidson et al .  also point out the appearance of n  ii absorptions in the blue spectrum , but did not discuss these changes in detail .",
    "spatial mappings are being analysed by gull et al .",
    "( in prep . ) and show a distinctive changing ionisation balance when comparing the forbidden [ fe  iii ] and [ fe  ii ] emission during the periastron passage .",
    "mehner et al .  (",
    "2015 ) have further analysed several ground- and space - based observations of @xmath0  car across its 2014 event , including important observations of the reflected polar spectrum , which show fewer changes in the broad wind emission lines than those seen in direct line - of - sight .    further complicating the story of @xmath0  car s 2014 spectroscopic event are _ swift _ x - ray monitoring observations of the x - ray minimum ( corcoran et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "comparison of the recent _ swift _ measurements to _ rxte _ observations of @xmath0  car s 1998.0 , 2003.5 , and 2009.0 events shows that the start of the x - ray minimum is remarkably reproducible , to within one day over the last @xmath23  years , helping define the 2023  day period ( corcoran et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "however , the recovery from the x - ray minimum is not as well behaved , with the 2009.0 recovery occurring @xmath24  days earlier compared to the 1998.0 and 2003.5 recoveries , and the 2014.6 recovery time being intermediate to those of the short 2009.0 recovery time compared to the longer 1998.0 and 2003.5 recoveries ( corcoran et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "in an attempt to understand better @xmath0  car s spectroscopic events , we obtained frequent ground - based , optical , high - resolution ( @xmath25 ) spectroscopy of the system as the periastron passage approached in 2014 ( section 2 ) , allowing for comparisons to the previous 2009 periastron passage . among the many resulting observations",
    ", we noticed a strong , additional absorption on the he  i lines as the system approached the x - ray minimum and higher energy forbidden and permitted lines reached a minimum , all of which happened just prior to the recent periastron passage . we discuss this result in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss how the absorptions are related to the binary orbit and their repeatability .",
    "section 5 presents a very detailed account of the formation of these spectral features and comparisons with our expectations from hydrodynamical simulations at different orbital epochs through the periastron passage .",
    "we conclude the study in section 6 where we highlight our main findings of this study .",
    "during the 2009 periastron passage of @xmath0 carinae , we began monitoring the system with the fiber - fed echelle spectrograph ( richardson et al .",
    "2010 ) on the ctio 1.5 m telescope operated by the smarts consortium . in 2011 , this spectrograph was decommissioned in favor of a new , high - efficiency spectrograph , chiron ( tokovinin et al .",
    "2013 ) that covers the optical from @xmath26   to @xmath27  .",
    "both of these spectrographs were fed starlight through a multi - mode fibre that has a size of 2.7on the sky .",
    "we began monitoring the system with the `` slit '' mode that has a resolving power of @xmath28 in early 2012 , which we continued whenever possible leading up to the current 2014 spectroscopic event and recovery .",
    "in total we collected 207 spectra between the calendar dates 2012 march 03 and 2015 july 27 .",
    "some spectra were obtained with chiron in the `` slicer '' mode , which delivers spectra with a resolving power of @xmath29 .",
    "all spectra were corrected for bias and flat field effects and wavelength calibrated through the chiron pipeline .",
    "this leaves a very strong blaze function present on each order which is difficult to remove in the presence of strong emission lines with widths similar to the echelle order range in some cases .",
    "therefore , we observed hr 4468 ( b9.5vn ) and @xmath30 col ( o9.5v ) to fit the continuum blaze function empirically on orders without spectral lines .",
    "the remaining orders ( primarily around h@xmath13 and h@xmath31 ) were interpolated to match adjacent orders .",
    "the resulting spectra were then normalized and combined into standard one - dimensional spectra , and the resulting order - overlaps in the blue showed us that the blaze removal was accurate to @xmath32 .",
    "a global normalization was then applied to obtain a unit continuum , which we adjusted in the regions adjacent to our spectral lines of interest for analysis .            in order to compare our observations to the binary clock",
