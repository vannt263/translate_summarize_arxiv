    ", we propose to use the exchange field created by an adatom to switch the magnetic configuration of an ad - cluster from one magnetic state to another one .",
    "recently , there has been increasing interest in investigating non - collinear nanostructures on ferromagnetic@xcite or non - magnetic surfaces@xcite . here",
    ", we choose as a substrate a ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath1-ni surface which provides a magnetic coupling between the adatoms and the substrate atoms .",
    "the ni(111 ) surface was chosen , in which the surface geometry is triangular , meaning , in terms of magnetic coupling@xcite , that a compact trimer with antiferromagnetic interactions sitting on the surface suffer necessarily magnetic frustration .",
    "this leads to the well - known non - collinear neel states being characterized by 120@xmath2 angles between the moments .",
    "hence , we face in such a system an interplay between the non - collinear coupling tendencies arizing from the interaction among the adatoms in the cluster and the collinear tendencies arizing from the additional coupling to the substrate atoms : this is very different to the ni(001 ) surface where the frustration arizes from the competition between the coupling in the cluster and with the substrate@xcite .",
    "our calculations are based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) of density functional theory with the parametrization of vosko _",
    "et al._@xcite . the full",
    "non - spherical potential was used , taking into account the correct description of the wigner ",
    "seitz atomic cells.@xcite angular momenta up to @xmath3 were included in the expansion of the green functions and up to @xmath4 in the charge density expansion .",
    "relativistic effects were described in the scalar relativistic approximation .",
    "first , the surface green functions are determined by the screened kkr method@xcite for the ( 111 ) surface of ni which serves as the reference system .",
    "the lsda equilibrium lattice parameter of ni was used ( 6.46  a.u . @xmath5  3.42   ) and the magnetic moment at the surface is 0.63 @xmath6 . to describe the cr and mn adatoms on the surface we consider a cluster of perturbed potentials with a size of 48 perturbed sites for all kind of ad - clusters considered .",
    "we consider the adatoms at the unrelaxed hollow position in the first vacuum layer .",
    "we allow for the relaxation of the magnetic moment directions with respect to the direction of the substrate magnetization@xcite .",
    "since the collinear magnetic state represents a self - consistent solution of the kohn - sham equations , total energy calculations are necessary to check whether the non - collinear solution represents a true energy minimum or only a local minimum , with the collinear state representing the total minimum .",
    "this proved to be important , e.g. , for cr dimers on ni(001 )  @xcite , where the collinear solution was found to have a lower total energy .",
    "the driving mechanism for non - collinear magnetism in small transition metal clusters is a competition of antiferromagnetic ( or antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ) interactions . in other cases , such as @xmath7-element systems@xcite or ad - layers and chains@xcite ,",
    "the spin - orbit interaction can also be of significance but in transition metals usually frustration is the dominating effect . in the case of magnetically non - collinear transition metal clusters",
    "adsorbed on ferromagnetic surfaces , it is helpful for the interpretation of the results to distinguish between three factors contributing to the solution : ( i ) the magnetic interaction of the cluster adatoms with the substrate , ( ii ) the magnetic pair interaction among the atoms in the cluster , and ( iii ) the geometry of the cluster .",
    "this separation is meaningful because the first - neighbours exchange interaction is energetically dominant compared to second , third , etc .",
    "neighbours , and because in different cluster sizes or shapes the type of pair interaction ( ferro- or antiferromagnetic ) does not change qualitatively .",
    "quantitatively , however , this is only an approximation , and effects beyond this are included in the self - consistent solution . in view of the above",
    ", we proceed by first presenting results for the single adatoms , then the dimers , and then trimers and tetramers of various shapes .",
    "we expect that cr and mn clusters are candidates for non - collinear magnetism , because the cr - cr and mn - mn first - neighbors pair interactions are antiferromagnetic .",
    "investigating the magnetism of ad - clusters starts by understanding the magnetism of adatoms and ad - dimers .    _",
    "single adatoms . _",
    "our calculations show that the single cr adatom is af coupled to the surface with an increase of the magnetic moments ( @xmath8 = 3.77 @xmath6 and @xmath9 = 3.70 @xmath6 ) compared to the results obtained for ni(001)@xcite ( @xmath8 = 3.48 @xmath6 and @xmath9 = 3.35 @xmath6 ) .",
    "this increase arizes from the weaker hybridization of the @xmath10 wavefunctions with the substrate ",
    "the adatom has three neighbours on the ( 111 ) surface and four on the ( 001 ) .",
    "the calculated energy difference between the fm and af configurations is high so that the af configuration is stable at room temperature ( @xmath11  mev , corresponding to 1085  k ) .",
    "also our results for the mn adatom on ni(111 ) are similar to what we found on ni(001 ) .",
    "the single mn adatom prefers to couple ferromagnetically to the substrate .",
    "the energy difference between the two possible magnetic configurations is @xmath12  mev .",
    "for the ( 001 ) surfaces the energy differences are both for cr and mn larger , since they roughly scale with the coordination number ( @xmath13  mev , @xmath14  mev ) .",
    "the magnetic moments of mn are high and reach a value of 4.17 @xmath6 for the fm configuration and 4.25 @xmath6 for the af configuration .",
    "the moments are higher than for the mn adatoms on ni(001 ) ( @xmath8 = 4.09 @xmath6 and @xmath9 = 3.92 @xmath6 ) , again due to the lower coordination and hybridization of the @xmath10 levels .",
    "this type of coupling to the substrate ( af for cr and fm for mn ) can be understood in terms of the @xmath0-@xmath0 hybridization of the adatom wavefunctions with the ones of the substrate , and is described , e.g. , in ref .  .    _",
    "_ for the compact dimers , three collinear configurations are possible : ferromagnetic ( fm ) ( see fig .",
    "[ dimer - ni111](a ) ) , with the moments of both atoms parallel to the substrate moments ( fig .",
    "[ dimer - ni111](b ) ) , antiferromagnetic ( af ) , with the moments of both atoms antiparallel to the substrate moments , and ferrimagnetic ( ferri ) ( see fig .",
    "[ dimer - ni111](c ) ) , where the magnetic moment of one of the dimer atoms is parallel to the moments of the substrate , while the other one is antiparallel .",
    "since the direct exchange in a cr pair ( or a mn pair ) is antiferromagnetic  ( for an explanation in terms of the alexander - anderson model  @xcite see @xcite ) , and stronger than the adatom - substrate interaction , the ferri solution is expected to prevail . indeed , cr dimers on ni(111 ) as on ni(001 ) are characterized by a collinear ferri coupling as a ground state .",
    "the difference is , however , that no non - collinear solution was found on ni(111 ) , as opposed to ni(001 )  @xcite .",
    "this is understandable , because the non - collinear state in the dimer on ni(001 ) arises from the competition between the intra - dimer cr - cr antiferromagnetic interaction and the cr - ni antiferromagnetic interaction . on the ni(111 ) surface , the coordination to the ni substrate is lower , therefore the interaction with the substrate is insufficient to overcome the cr - cr interaction .",
    "in fact the ferri total energy is 317.32 mev / adatom lower than the af one and 352.54 mev / adatom lower than the fm one .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the next step is to move the additional adatom c and increase its distance with respect to a in order to reshape the trimer into an isosceles triangle ( what we call `` corner trimer '' in fig .",

    ", the trimer loses the frustration and is characterized , thus , by a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state : the moments of adatoms a and c are af oriented to the substrate ( following the af ni - cr exchange ) , while the moment of the central adatom b is fm oriented to the substrate , following the af cr - cr coupling to its two neighbors .",
    "the magnetic moments do not change much compared to the compact trimer .",
    "the central adatom b carries a moment of 2.94 @xmath6 while the two others have a slightly more sizeable moment of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the total magnetic moment ( @xmath16 ) increases to a value close to the one obtained for non - interacting dimer - adatom system .",
    "while the non - collinear state is lost for the corner cr trimer , it is present for the corner mn trimer as a local minimum with a tiny energy difference of 4.82 mev / adatom higher than the ferri ground state .",
    "this value is equivalent to a temperature of @xmath17 56  k , meaning that at room temperature both configurations co - exist . here",
    "ferri means that the central adatom b is af oriented to the substrate with a magnetic moment of 3.71 @xmath6 , forced by its two fm companions a and c ( moment of 3.83 @xmath6 ) which have only one first neighboring adatom and are less constrained .",
    "the total moment of the adcluster is also high ( @xmath18 ) compared to the compact trimer value , reaching the value of the non - interacting system ( with the third atom of the trimer far away from the other two ) .",

    "it is important to point out that the af coupling between these two latter adatoms is lost by increasing the distance between them .",

    "concerning the mn case for a chain , a non - collinear configuration was obtained as a local minimum with a small energy difference compared to the ground state which is the collinear ferri solution ( 8.50 mev / adatom @xmath17 98.64 k ) .",
    "the magnetic moments do not change a lot compared to the values obtained for the corner trimer .",
    "the central adatom b carries a moment of @xmath22 while the a and c have a higher moment of 3.84 @xmath6 . in the non - collinear solution , the central mn adatom with a moment of 3.76 @xmath6 , as seen previously",

    "the total moment is high for both magnetic configurations . for the ferri solution , it reaches 3.90 @xmath6 , while for the non - collinear solution the total moment value is smaller ( 3.84 @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the total energies of the three trimers we investigated .",
    "the compact trimer has more first neighboring bonds and is expected to be the most stable trimer .",
    "the energy differences confirm this statement . indeed",
    "the total energy of the cr compact trimer is 119 mev / adatom lower than the total energy of the corner trimer and 198.16 mev / adatom lower than the total energy of the linear trimer .",
    "similarly , the mn compact trimer has a lower energy of 53 mev / adatom compared to the corner trimer and a lower energy of 100 mev / adatom than the linear trimer .    by summarizing the results for the total moments of the adatoms , we see that the non - interacting cluster consisting of a single adatom and an adatom dimer has a high moment .",
    "this large total moment also survives for linear and corner trimers .",

    "this gives a magnetic configuration with a low total magnetic moments of @xmath23 for cr tetramer and 0.34 @xmath6 for mn tetramer .",
    "the cr tetramer , in particular , shows also a non - collinear configuration ( fig .",

    "as a summary , we have investigated the complex magnetism of small cr and mn ad - clusters on ni(111 ) .",
    "this is a prototype system where two types of magnetic frustration occur : ( i ) frustration within the ad - cluster and ( ii ) frustration arizing from antiferromagnetic coupling between the adatoms in the cluster and competing magnetic interaction between the adclusters and the surface atoms .",
    "while the resulting collinear and non - collinear structures are very complex , a unifying feature is that all compact structures ( dimers , trimers and tetramers ) have very small total moments , as a result of the strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the cluster atoms leading to a nearly complete compensation of the local moments , while the more open structures , like the corner and linear trimers and the tetramer b , have rather large total moments of about 4 @xmath6 .",
    "since the transtion between a compact and an open structure requires to move one adatom by just one atomic step , we might consider this motion as a magnetic switch , which via the local magnetic exchange field of the single adatom allows to switch the total moment on and off , and which therefore might be of interest for magnetic storage .",
