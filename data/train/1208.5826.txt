    "the study of @xmath0 surfaces with non - symplectic symmetry has arisen as an application of the torelli theorem , and by now , it has been recognized as closely related to classical geometry and special arithmetic quotients .",
    "they were first studied systematically in the involution case by nikulin @xcite , who classified their topological types using the lattices of @xmath2-cycles ( anti-)invariant under the involutions .",
    "the anti - invariant lattices also provide the period domains , which are hermitian symmetric of type iv and whose quotients by the orthogonal groups give the moduli spaces .",
    "what comes next to the involution case is the case of automorphisms of order @xmath1 .",
    "kond , dolgachev , and van geemen @xcite , @xcite studied two moduli spaces of @xmath0 surfaces with such symmetry , in connection with genus @xmath3 curves and cubic surfaces .",
    "subsequently , artebani - sarti @xcite and the third - named author @xcite gave a topological classification of such automorphisms .",

    "let @xmath7 be the lattice of @xmath8-invariant cycles , and @xmath9 be its orthogonal complement .",
    "these lattices have 3-elementary discriminant groups , analogous to the 2-elementary property in the involution case .",
    "what is more crucial is that @xmath10 is endowed with the structure of an eisenstein lattice , namely a hermitian form over the ring of eisenstein integers .",
    "then a result of @xcite and @xcite says that the topological types of such pairs @xmath11 are , by associating @xmath10 , in one - to - one correspondence with certain eisenstein lattices embeddable in the @xmath0 lattice . in view of this",
    ", we shall call such a pair @xmath11 an _ eisenstein @xmath0 surface_. according to @xcite , @xcite , @xmath10 is in turn encoded in the pair @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the rank of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the length of its discriminant group , and there are exactly twenty - four such @xmath12 .    for each @xmath12 ,",
    "the period domain for eisenstein @xmath0 surfaces @xmath11 of that type is the complex ball associated to @xmath10 .",
    "one obtains the moduli space @xmath16 of those eisenstein @xmath0 surfaces as the quotient of the ball by the unitary group of @xmath10 , with a heegner divisor removed .",
    "this story is similar to the involution case , but note that the types of period domains are different .    in this article",
    "we study the birational types of @xmath16 .",
    "the spaces @xmath17 and @xmath18 , studied in @xcite and @xcite , @xcite respectively , have been known to be rational by the corresponding results for the moduli of genus @xmath3 curves ( @xcite ) and of cubic surfaces ( classical ) .",

    "[ main ] the moduli space @xmath16 of eisenstein @xmath0 surfaces of type @xmath12 is rational , possibly except for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    a similar rationality result is known in the involution case ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to expect analogous results for other non - symplectic symmetry , and the present article goes into the eisenstein case .",
    "in fact , it appears that automorphisms of order @xmath2 and @xmath1 cover a wide range of non - symplectic automorphisms : as the order grows , there seem to be only a few number of moduli spaces , of rather small dimension ( though the classification is not yet completed )",
    ". we will prove theorem [ main ] case - by - case .",
    "a basic strategy is to first find a _ canonical _",
    "triple cover construction of general members of @xmath16 using @xmath21-curves on a hirzebruch surface @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , we consider an explicit locus @xmath24 parametrizing curves with prescribed type of singularities and irreducible decomposition .",
    "we obtain a period map @xmath25 by taking the resolutions of cyclic triple covers of @xmath26 branched over @xmath27 .",
    "we can calculate the degree of such maps @xmath28 in a systematic manner ( see  [ ssec : recipe ] ) .",
    "if we could find those @xmath29 with @xmath30 , the problem is reduced to the rationality of @xmath31 which we prove by studying the @xmath32-action .",
    "this strategy is analogous to the one in the involution case @xcite , but hidden behind the similarity are some subtle features in the present case .",
    "the first is the existence of isolated fixed points of @xmath33 , which appear over the singular points of @xmath34 . by the above construction",
    ", we keep away from such fixed points , in a sense .",
    "secondly , asking the triple cover to have canonical singularities is a strong demand , so that the singularities of @xmath34 are quite limited ( at worst ramphoid cusps ) .",
    "finally , smooth rational surfaces @xmath35 with @xmath36 are rare : they are only @xmath26 .    the above easy construction offers period maps of degree @xmath37 for as many as seventeen @xmath16 , but does not cover all cases . to analyze the remaining five ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , we develop a theory of branch _ curves _ that deals with isolated fixed points more substantially .",
    "this is the notion of _ mixed branch_. it contains and is more flexible than @xmath21-curves , and using it we can work with fixed curves and isolated fixed points quite satisfactorily .",
    "those five @xmath16 are provided with birational period maps using mixed branch .",
    "the rationality problem is open for @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ". they are unirational by the constructions in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for those two we failed to find a canonical and effective construction as above , due to which we could not approach them .",
