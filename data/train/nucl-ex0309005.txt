    "several experimental studies have been made in the recent years to understand the reaction mechanism of fragment emission in light heavy ion collisions @xcite at low bombarding energies ( @xmath8 10 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "the fragments ( mostly binary in nature at these energies ) are emitted with different degree of dissipation of the entrance channel kinetic energy between the two colliding ions - ranging from quasi elastic to deep inelastic ( di ) to the fully relaxed fusion - fission ( ff ) processes .",
    "thus the fragments carry the signatures of nuclear dissipation , which , if deciphered , may bring out valuable informations on the nature of nuclear dissipation .",
    "in addition to kinetic energy dissipation , dissipative heavy ion collision processes also result in significant dissipation of relative angular momentum in the entrance channel .",
    "phenomenologically , the kinetic energy dissipation originates from friction ( radial and tangential ) between the surfaces of the rotating dinuclear system ; on the other hand , angular momentum dissipation is decided solely by the tangential component of the friction , and the magnitude of dissipation is expected to lie between two limits ( rolling and sticking ) .",
    "however , very large dissipation of relative angular momentum in excess of the sticking limit predictions has also been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "this anomaly , as pointed out by several authors @xcite , is due to the ambiguity in the determination of the magnitude of angular momentum dissipation ( and vis - a - vis the rotational contribution to the fragment kinetic energy ) .",
    "estimation of the angular momentum in the exit channel is strongly dependent on another poorly known factor , i.e. , the scission configuration of the rotating dinuclear system .",
    "this apparently hinted at the incompleteness of our understanding of the dynamics of nuclear dissipation process , which prompted us to make a systematic study of angular momentum dissipation in light nuclear systems where coulomb and rotational contributions to the fragment kinetic energies are comparable .",
    "it is clear from the above that an independent estimation of the scission configuration is necessary to make a proper estimate of the angular momentum transfer .",
    "generally , it is estimated from the total kinetic energy of the rotating dinuclear system , @xmath9 , which is given by ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the contribution from coulomb and nuclear forces at dinuclear separation distance @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the reduced mass of the dinuclear configuration , @xmath14 is the relative angular momentum in the entrance channel and @xmath15 is the numerical factor denoting the fraction of the angular mometum transferred depending on the type of frictional force . since it is not possible to determine both @xmath15 and @xmath12 by solving eq .",
    "[ eq : ef ] , in the earlier works , one of them was estimated phenomenologically ( usually for @xmath15 , its value corresponding to sticking limit was taken ) and the other was estimated from the experimental fragment kinetic energy data using eq .",
    "[ eq : ef ] .",
    "it is however well known ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) that , apart from dissipative collision process , fusion - fission process also contributes significantly in the fragment emission scenario .",
    "thus , it is required to estimate and separate out the ff part of the fragment energy spectra in order to extract the kinetic energy distribution of the di part of the rotating dinuclear system . in the present work ,",
    "we have studied fragment emission from @xmath1o ( 116 mev ) + @xmath2al , @xmath3si , @xmath4ne ( 145 mev ) + @xmath2al , @xmath5co and report on how angular momentum dissipation can be estimated from the ff and di components extracted by nonlinear optimisation procedure using multiple gaussians @xcite .",
    "some parts of the @xmath1o ( 116 mev ) + @xmath2al data have already been published in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that the ff component is quite competitive , in agreement with the previous work @xcite .",

    "self - supporting targets of 420 @xmath13g/@xmath20 @xmath2al , @xmath211 mg/@xmath20 @xmath3si and @xmath212 mg/@xmath20 @xmath5co were used in the experiment .",
    "the fragments were detected using three solid state ( si(sb ) ) telescopes ( @xmath21 12@xmath22 @xmath23e , 300@xmath22 e ) mounted on one arm of the 91.5 cm scattering chamber .",

    "the telescopes were calibrated using elastically scattered @xmath1o and @xmath4ne ions from au target and @xmath24-particles from ( @xmath25th-@xmath24 ) source .",
    "energy losses of the incoming beam as well as the outgoing fragments in the target have been properly taken care of .",

    "the ff contributions have been obtained by fitting the energy distributions with a gaussian having centroid at the energies obtained from viola systematics @xcite , adapted for light nuclear systems @xcite , of total kinetic energies(tke ) of mass - symmetric fission fragments duly corrected for asymmetric factor @xcite .",
    "the width of the gaussian was obtained by fitting the lower energy tail of the spectra .",
    "the ff component of the energy spectrum thus obtained was then substracted from the full energy spectrum . in the next step , the di component was obtained by fitting the substracted energy spectra with a second gaussian .",

    "the centre of mass ( c.m . ) angular distributions of the ff components , as expected , are found to be symmetric ( @xmath33 ) , whereas those of the di components are falling off more rapidly indicating shorter lifetime of the dinuclear composite ( fig .",

    "the values of @xmath34 for be and b are found to be nearly constant as a function of angle , whereas those for c and n are found to decrease at forward angles ( @xmath35 ) and then the two gradually tend to become constant ; these imply that , beyond this point , the kinetic energy damping is complete and dynamic equilibrium has been established before the scission of the dinuclear composite takes place . in the following ,",
    "we try to explore these completely damped collisions further to extract the magnitude of angular mometum damping .",
    "as mentioned earlier , magnitude of angular momentum damping may be estimated from eq .",
    "[ eq : ef ] only if scission configuration can be estimated independently . assuming the friction to be at its limit ( sticking limit )",
    ", the extracted scission configuration for @xmath4ne ( 120 mev ) + @xmath2al was found to be @xmath2111 fm @xcite , which is much larger than the sum of nuclear radii . however , experimental study of di collision in the reaction @xmath4ne ( 151 mev ) + @xmath2al @xcite indicated that scission configuration of the fully damped component ( at larger angles ) may be quite compact , whereas that for the partially damped component ( at smaller angles ) may be quite elongated having neck length @xmath213.7 fm .",
    "this may be intuitively justified as follows .",
    "deep inelastic collisions are believed to occur within the angular momentum window between the critical angular momentum for fusion , @xmath29 and the grazing angular momentum , @xmath30 .",
    "the partially damped part of it ( at forward angles ) originate in near peripheral collisions ( @xmath36 ) , which correspond to small overlap and thus a fairly elongated dinuclear configuration ; on the other hand , fully damped components ( at larger angles ) correspond to more compact collisions near @xmath37 .",
    "interestingly , fusion - fission yield is also most predominant in the vicinity of @xmath37 .",
    "it is , therefore , likely that the exit channel configurations of both the processes are similar and it appears to be fairly reasonable to assume a compact scission shape for the fully damped component of the data . in the present work , we estimated the scission configuration from the extracted fusion - fission component of the measured fragment energy spectra .",
    "the separation distance @xmath12 between the the two fragments at the scission point is calculated from the energy centroid of the ff energy spectra which obeyed viola systematics @xcite corrected for asymmetric mass splitting @xcite .",
    "the mean values of @xmath12 thus estimated are ; @xmath38 fm for @xmath1o + @xmath2al , @xmath39 fm for @xmath1o + @xmath3si , @xmath40 fm for @xmath4ne + @xmath2al and @xmath41 fm for @xmath4ne + @xmath5co . assuming these scission configurations corresponding to each mass splitting to be frozen , eq .",
    "[ eq : ef ] may then be used to extract the mean angular momentum dissipation factor , @xmath15 , in the case of di collisions .",
    "the values of @xmath15 extracted for different systems are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( filled circles ) alongwith the rolling and sticking limit predictions ( dotted and solid curves , respectively ) for the same . for the purpose of evaluation of @xmath15 ,",
    "the value of initial angular momentum @xmath14 was taken to be equal to the critical angular momentum for fusion , @xmath29 .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that for all the reactions considered , there is discrepancy between the experimental and empirical estimates of angular momentum dissipation . in all cases ,",
    "the experimental estimates of the mean angular momentum dissipation are more than their limiting values predicted by the sticking condition ( for @xmath4ne + @xmath5co reaction , however , the experimental estimates of @xmath15 and the corresponding sticking limit predictions are within the ranges of experimental uncertainties ) . the discrepancy is more for lighter fragments , and gradually decreases for heavier fragments .",
    "this may be intuitively understood as follows ; it is known from the study of dissipative dynamics of fission ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) that , strong frictional forces in the exit channel cause considerable retardation of the scissioning process leading to increase in scission time scale . as the exit channel configurations of the fully damped di process",
    "are taken to be similar to those for ff process ( except that the dinuclear system , in case of di collision , is formed beyond the conditional saddle point directly ) , the dynamics of di process may also experience stronger frictional forces .",
    "microscopically , friction is generated due to stochastic exchange of nucleons between the reacting partners through the window formed by the overlap of the density distributions of the two .",
    "stronger friction , in this scenario , essentially means larger degree of density overlap and more nucleon exchange .",
    "consequently , lighter di fragments ( corresponding to more net nucleon transfer ) originate from deeper collisions , for which interaction times are larger .",
    "therefore , angular momentum dissipation too , originating due to stochastic nucleon exchange , may be more which , at least qualitatively , explains the observed trend .",
    "moreover , it is also seen that the difference between the experimental estimates and the corresponding sticking limit predictions is more for lighter systems ( @xmath1o + @xmath2al , @xmath3si , @xmath4ne + @xmath2al ) , and less for the heavier system ( @xmath4ne + @xmath5co ) .",
    "qualitatively , this may be due to entrance channel effect @xcite ; as the formation time ( of shape equilibrated fused composite ) is smaller for the lighter system at lower spin , the two time scales ( of fusion and di processes ) are closer",
    ". this may give rise to larger angular momentum dissipation for lighter systems as observed in the present work .",
    "in summary , we have studied fragment emission from @xmath1o ( 116 mev ) + @xmath2al , @xmath3si , @xmath4ne ( 145 mev ) + @xmath2al , @xmath5co reactions and extracted the contributions of fusion - fission and deep inelastic components . assuming a compact exit channel configuration for the fully damped part of the di reactions , the exit channel configuration has been estimated from the extracted ff part of the spectra . the angular momentum dissipation for the fully damped di reactions has then been extracted using these scission shapes .",
    "the angular momentum dissipations have been found to be more than the corresponding sticking limit predictions in all the cases except for the case of @xmath4ne + @xmath5co , where , the mean values of the experimental estimate of angular momentum dissipation are systematically less than the corresponding sticking limit values , though they are within the range of experimental uncertainty .",
    "this may be due to stronger friction in the exit channel which may cause longer overlap of the dinuclear system and consequently more nucleon exchange and dissipation of angular momentum due to stochastic nature of nucleon exchange .",
    "the effect is more for lighter systems , as in this case there is more overlap in the time scales of ff and di processes .",
    "however , further systematic studies for each system at different bombarding energies are needed for a better understanding on the dissipation mechanism in light nuclear systems . the inclusive yields for some fragments may have additional contribution from other reaction mechanisms like projectile breakup process ( e.g. , @xmath24-breakup in the case of ne projectile ) , which should be properly taken care of .",
    "the inclusive data presented in this paper may also be useful for future exclusive experiments for which light charged particles are detected in coincidence with either fully damped deep - inelastic or fusion - fission fragments .",
