    "information theoretic security has received a significant attention recently .",
    "one mainstream direction has been on the wireless transmission of confidential messages from a source to a destination , in the presence of internal and/or external eavesdroppers . toward achieving that goal",
    ", the communicating pair exploits the stochasticity and the asymmetry of wireless channels between the communicating pair and the eavesdroppers .",
    "a stochastic encoder at the transmitter makes use of the available channel state information ( csi ) in a way for the mutual information leaked to the adversaries remain arbitrarily small .",
    "it is designed in a way that , even when the adversaries have access to the full csi of the main channel , i.e. , between the transmitter and the receiver as well as the eavesdropper channel , i.e. , between the transmitter and itself , it still will obtain an arbitrarily low rate of information on the message .",
    "likewise , the adversary relies on csi to make decisions .",
    "for instance , a half - duplex hybrid adversary , capable of jamming or eavesdropping at a given time ( but not both simultaneously ) decides between jamming vs. eavesdropping , based on the available csi .",
    "the assumption that the adversaries have full csi of all channels is typical in the literature  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "while this assumption leads to robust systems in terms of providing security as it makes no assumptions on the adversaries , it can be too conservative in some cases .",
    "for example , to obtain main csi , an adversary relies on the same resource as the transmitter : feedback from the legitimate receiver .",
    "hence , from the perspective of the receiver , there is a tradeoff between revealing csi and keeping it secret : if the legitimate receiver chooses not to reveal csi , it will sacrifice some achievable rate of reliable communication , but the adversary will have to make decisions under a higher uncertainty . in this paper , we study the tradeoffs involving obtaining csi .",
    "we ask the questions , should a legitimate pair obtain csi and if so , what should be their strategy ?    to that end , we focus on the system depicted in figure  [ fig : sysmdl ] .",
    "we assume all three channels to be block fading . in each block ,",
    "based on the available csi , the half - duplex adversary can choose to do jamming at a fixed transmission power or eavesdropping , but not both . our objective is to maximize the rate of reliable communication over the main channel , subject to full equivocation  @xcite ( weak secrecy ) at the adversary .",
    "the adversary can follow an arbitrary strategy in its choice of jamming vs. eavesdropping at any given block . in the case in which the receiver feeds back main csi , it may do so in two ways : directly by sending back the exact state of the channel or by sending reverse pilots , trying to exploit channel reciprocity ( similar to  @xcite ) .",
    "while the former method completely reveals the main csi , it eliminates the possibility of the adversary to learn the jammer csi . on the other hand , while the pilot feedback successfully hides the main csi , it enables the adversary to estimate the jammer csi . in terms of the secrecy encoding strategies ,",
    "we address the possibilities under two general scenarios : the ergodic and the delay - limited . in the former case ,",
    "one message is encoded across infinitely many blocks and in the latter case , a separate message is encoded over each block , to be decoded immediately . thus , in the delay - limited scenario , we also impose an additional probabilistic constraint on the decoding and secrecy outage events .    in the delay limited scenario ,",
    "we show that by revealing the main csi , the receiver achieves a higher secrecy rate under the outage constraint , compared to transmission with no csi .",
    "furthermore , we show that main csi is more valuable for the adversary than the jamming csi in both delay - limited and ergodic scenarios . in the ergodic scenario",
    ", we observe that the transmitter may not need the csi to achieve higher secrecy rates .",
    "there is a recent research interest on hybrid adversaris . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors formulate the mimo wiretap channel as a two player zero - sum game in which the payoff function is an achievable ergodic secrecy rate .",
    "the strategy of the transmitter is to send the message in a full power or to utilize some of the available power to produce artificial noise .",
    "the conditions under which pure nash equilibrium exists are studied . in  @xcite , the authors consider fast fading main and eavesdropper channels and static jammer channel . under this channel configuration",
    ", they propose a novel encoding scheme which is called block - markov wyner secrey encoding . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors introduce a pilot contamination attack in which the adversary jams during the reverse training phase to prevent the transmitter from estimating the main csi correctly . as a result , the transmitter incorrectly designs precoder which will increase the signal strength at the adversary that eavesdrops the main channel during the data transmission phase .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ chap :",
    "system ] , we first describe the system model .",
    "we then explain the channel model and csi feedback models . at the end of the section",
    ", we explain the problem formulations . in section  [ chap : result ] , we present the results for both delay limited and ergodic scenarios . in section  [ chap : numeric ] , we present our numerical results and conclude the paper in section  [ chap : conc ] .",
    "in this paper , we focus on a block fading channel model .",
    "time is divided into discrete blocks and there are @xmath0 channel uses in each block .",
    "channel state is assumed to be constant within a block and varies randomly from one block to the next .",
    "we assume all parties are half - duplex , thus the adversary can not jam and eavesdrop simultaneously .",
    "the observed signals at the legitimate receiver and the adversary in @xmath1-th block are as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the transmitted signal , @xmath4 is the transmission power , @xmath5 is the signal received by the legitimate receiver , @xmath6 is the signal received by the adversary , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are noise vectors distributed as complex gaussian , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively , and @xmath13 is the jamming power .",
    "indicator function @xmath14 , if the adversary is in a jamming state in the @xmath1-th block ; otherwise @xmath15",
    ". channel gains , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are defined to be the independent complex gains of transmitter - to - receiver channel , transmitter - to - adversary channel , and adversary - to - receiver channel , respectively ( as illustrated in figure  [ fig : sysmdl ] ) .",
    "associated power gains are denoted with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that channel reciprocity principle is valid for all channels , i.e. , reverse channels and forward channels have identical gains .",
    "we also assume that joint probability density function of instantaneous power gains , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 $ ] , is well defined and known by all entities .",
    "the legitimate pair may choose to obtain main csi or communicate without it .",
    "we call the latter strategy the _ no csi case_. if they choose to obtain main csi , at the beginning of each time block , the transmitter sends training symbols to the legitimate receiver . in this paper",
    ", we ignore the overhead associated with this training process .",
    "we assume that , using the training symbols sent at the beginning of block @xmath1 , the legitimate receiver obtains perfect knowledge of @xmath16 and the adversary obtains perfect knowledge of @xmath17 .    once the receiver observes main csi , it uses two possible methods for feeding back this information .",
    "the first one is directly feeding back the observed channel state : the value of @xmath16 is encoded at the receiver and sent to the transmitter in a feedback packet .",
    "thus , we call this feedback method the _ packet feedback_. we assume that the legitimate receiver and the adversary both decode this packet successfully and learn @xmath16 .",
    "the second method is using pilot based csi feedback in which the receiver sends training symbols to the transmitter .",
    "we call this second method the _ pilot feedback_. we assume that by using these reverse training symbols , the legitimate transmitter obtains perfect knowledge of @xmath16 and the adversary obtains the perfect knowledge of @xmath18 . thus , in the first method , the adversary obtains the knowledge of @xmath16 , but not @xmath18 , whereas the reverse is true in the second method .",
    "the goal of the adversary is to minimize the achieved secrecy rate .",
    "the strategy space of the adversary in each block is binary : jamming or eavesdropping .",
    "the transmitter does not observe the strategy of the adversary in any given block , whereas we assume that the adversary knows the strategy of the transmitter a priori .    from one block to the next , the adversary chooses its strategy based on the transmitter s strategy and the obtained channel power gains , i.e. , @xmath24 for the no csi case , @xmath24 , @xmath25 for the packet feedback case , and @xmath24 , @xmath26 for the pilot feedback case .",
    "we denote the vector of channel power gains observed by the adversary at the beginning of the @xmath1th block with @xmath27 .",
    "the secrecy level of a transmitted message is measured by the equivocation rate at the adversary .",
    "the equivocation rate at the adversary is defined as the entropy of the transmitted message conditioned on the channel output and the available csi at the adversary .",
    "if the equivocation rate is equal to the secrecy rate , the message is said to be transmitted with _",
    "perfect secrecy_.      in our system , we consider two levels of encoding . at the higher level",
    ", secrecy is realized wyner code introduced in  @xcite .",
    "there , @xmath28 represents a wyner code of size @xmath29 that bears a confidential message set @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the codeword length in number of bits . a message , @xmath32 is mapped to @xmath33 bits by a secrecy encoder  @xcite and these @xmath33 bits",
    "are then mapped to channel encoded bits at the lower level of encoding using a sequence of codes , @xmath34 , one for each block @xmath35 . here , the code rate , @xmath36 , is chosen based on the main csi , obtained at the transmitter .",
    "the sequence of codewords is denoted with @xmath37 , and the decoder , @xmath38 maps the received sequence , @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the average error probability of the sequence of codes @xmath41 is denoted with the associated sequence @xmath42 . in this paper , we focus on two scenarios as to how secrecy encoding and channel encoding are applied : delay limited and ergodic .      in the delay - limited scenario ,",
    "the transmitter encodes a separate secret message , @xmath43 in each block @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , we use a separate secrecy encoder @xmath44 for each block , where @xmath45 is chosen to be identical to @xmath36 to meet the channel rate .",
    "the channel encoder merely maps these @xmath46 bits to @xmath0 gaussian random variables , @xmath47 , forming a gaussian codebook @xmath48 . for the delay - limited scenario ,",
    "we define the secrecy outage and connection outage events  @xcite as : @xmath49 respectively , where @xmath50      in the ergodic scenario , the transmitter has one secret message @xmath51 and encodes it over @xmath52 blocks using the @xmath53 encoder . in the ergodic scenario ,",
    "secrecy rate @xmath54 is said to be achievable if , for any @xmath55 , there exists sequence of channel codes @xmath41 for which the following are satisfied : @xmath56 for sufficiently large n and m and for any @xmath57 such that @xmath58=1 $ ] . here , we consider two possible channel encoding strategies :    * 1 .",
    "encoding across blocks : * we use this strategy in the no main csi case .",
    "in this strategy , the @xmath33 bits at the output of the secrecy encoder is channel encoded via a single @xmath59 gaussian codebook and the @xmath31 symbols are transmitted over the channel over @xmath52 blocks .",
    "block - by - block encoding : * we use this strategy when the main csi is available . to utilize the main channel knowledge",
    ", the transmitter chooses some @xmath60 and encodes the information using a gaussian codebook with the rate @xmath61 over block @xmath1 . with this choice , the transmitted codeword",
    "will not be decoded successfully if the adversary is in the jamming state and @xmath62 . to handle this possibility",
    ", we use a plain arq strategy in each block ( similar to  @xcite ) .",
    "transmissions that receive a negative acknowledgement ( nak ) are retransmitted until they are decoded successfully .",
    "one can notice that , in both the delay - limited and the ergodic scenarios , we use a constant secrecy rate @xmath54 .",
    "the goal of the transmitter is to maximize the secrecy rate , @xmath54 over the strategy space of secrecy encoding and channel encoding rates . to that end , we consider the worst case scenario , in which the adversary perfectly tracks the strategy of the transmitter in each block .",
    "furthermore , since the transmitter does not know the real state of the adversary , the strategy pair of the transmitter should satisfy the constraint for any arbitrary strategy of the adversary .",
    "thus , we choose the secrecy rate using : @xmath63 for all @xmath1 in both the delay - limited and the ergodic scenarios , subject to the following outage constraint in the delay - limited scenario only : @xmath64 with probability 1 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are indicator functions that take on a value @xmath67 in case of a connection and a secrecy outage , respectively . we evaluate @xmath68 under the no csi , packet feedback , and pilot feedback cases .",
    "note that the constraint enforces that the fraction of packets that are not in the both secrecy outage and the connection outage should be larger than a threshold as the number of blocks , @xmath52 , goes to infinity .",
    "note that , the reason why we focus on the specific encoding strategies specified under delay limited and ergodic scenarios in section  [ subsec : encoding ] is that , the solution , @xmath69 , of the maximin problem stated in ( [ problem ] ) is unknown  @xcite .",
    "the outage constraint in  ( [ threshold ] ) is formulated as @xmath70 note that in ( [ constraint2 ] ) , the secrecy outage event is represented with @xmath71 and the connection outage events are given as @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    for the delay limited scenario ,",
    "the solution of ( [ problem ] ) , subject to constraint  ( [ constraint2 ] ) leads to the following ordering of the achievable rate with respect to the type of feedback : @xmath74 [ thm : main ]    the above theorem implies that main csi , which is obtained with packet feedback is more valuable for the adversary than the jammer csi , which is obtained with pilot feedback .",
    "we now give an outline for the proof .",
    "the details of the proof can be found in section  [ chap : proof ] .",
    "the basic idea is to compare the feasible set of the problem ( [ problem ] ) for three cases .",

    "we observe that the solution to ( [ problem ] ) is directly related to the size of the feasible set .",
    "the strategy pair @xmath80 is the element of the feasible set , @xmath81 if @xmath82",

    "then , we observe @xmath89 which shows @xmath90 and this concludes the proof .",
    "we first present a secrecy rate that is achievable under the no csi case .",

    "next , we present an upper bound for the secrecy rates achieved with the block - by - block encoding strategy .",
    "[ upperbound ] under the block - by - block encoding strategy , the achievable secrecy rate is upper bounded by @xmath92^+ \\\\",
    "\\times p[h_z \\leq h_z^ * ] \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    to find this upper bound , we employ the following strategy .",
    "when the transmitter receives a nak signal , the transmitter sends an independent group of bits on the next block instead of retransmitting the previous packet  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors use this scheme for the secret key sharing .",
    "the crucial observation is that an upper bound for the achievable secret key rate is also an upper bound for the achievable secrecy rates .",
    "the details of the proof can be found at section  [ chap : upperbound ] .",
    "note that with the plain arq strategy described in section  [ chap : ergodicformulation ] , the achievable rate is identical to the expression provided in ( [ eq : block_upper_bnd ] ) , with @xmath93 $ ] replaced with @xmath94)^2 $ ] , and @xmath95 in the expectation term replaced with @xmath60 as shown in  @xcite . by comparing the upper bound given in theorem  [ upperbound ] ,",
    "we gain understanding on the performance of no csi case . in particular , whenever the achievable rate with the no csi case exceeds this bound , we know for sure that encoding across blocks ( no csi ) is preferable over block - by - block encoding with csi .",
    "the main difference between block - by - block encoding and encoding across blocks is that , in the former , the unsuccessfully received packets are discarded , whereas in the no csi case , all the information received by the receiver is used to decode the message .",
    "the set of parameters for which this is the case is illustrated in section  [ chap : numeric ] in an example .",
    "one can also write a general relationship between the performance with packet feedback and pilot feedback :    [ comparison ] any secrecy rate achievable with packet feedback strategy is also achievable with pilot feedback strategy .",
    "theorem  [ comparison ] , shows that main csi is more valuable for the adversary than the jamming csi in the ergodic scenario , as was the case in the delay limited scenario .",
    "the proof can be found at section  [ chap : comparison ]",
    "we first analyze the delay - limited case .",
    "we assume that both main and eavesdropper channels are characterized by block rayleigh fading , where the main channel and eavesdropper channel power gains follow an exponential distribution with a mean 10 and 1 , respectively .",
    "we also assume the jamming channel does not experience fading , where power gain is equal to 1 .",
    "the transmission power , @xmath4 , and the jamming power , @xmath13 are identical and chosen to be @xmath96 . in figure",

    "the achievable rates in figure  [ fig : ergodic ] follow the same ordering as given in theorem  ( [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "next , we simulate the ergodic scenario and compare the two strategies , encoding across blocks without csi and block - by - block encoding with packet csi feedback .",
    "we used the same power parameters as in the simulations for the delay - limited case .",
    "all three channels are assumed to be block rayleigh - fading wtih @xmath98 = 1 $ ] we select the encoding parameter , @xmath60 such that @xmath99 = 0.75 $ ] .    in figure  [",
    "fig : ergodic ] , we illustrate the region where the encoding across blocks outperforms the block - by - block encoding on the @xmath100,e[h_m]\\right)$ ] space .",
    "the region to the left of the border , given in the plot contains the set of @xmath100,e[h_m]\\right)$ ] for which the encoding across blocks results in a higher secrecy rate .",
    "the intuition behind this observation is that , when @xmath101 $ ] is much larger than @xmath102 $ ] , the positive operator inside the upper bound , @xmath103 loses its significance .",
    "we consider the wiretap channel model under the presence of half duplex adversary that is capable of either jamming or eavesdropping at a given time .",
    "we analyzed the achievable rates under a variety of scenarios involving different methods for obtaining transmitter csi .",
    "in particular , we considered no csi , csi with packet based feedback , and csi with pilot based feedback .",
    "each method provides a different grade of information not only to the transmitter on the main channel , but also to the adversary on all channels .",
    "we show for the delay limited scenario that , the highest secrecy rate is achieved with the pilot based feedback .",
    "similarly , in the ergodic case , we prove that the pilot - based csi feedback outperforms the packet - based csi feedback , however interestingly , in certain cases no csi may lead to a higher achievable secrecy rates than with csi .",
    "feasible set for the problem ( [ problem ] ) is defined to be @xmath104 where @xmath76 is the set of channel power gains such that the adversary is in the jamming state if @xmath78 .",

    "the equivalent form of ( [ problem ] ) is as follows : @xmath106 as seen from ( [ equivalent ] ) , @xmath68 does not depend on strategy of the adversary .",
    "however , the size of feasible set directly depends on the csi feedback scheme . from ( [ equivalent ] )",
