    "the chalker - coddington network model ( c - c model ) has been accepted as one of the simplest models @xcite to explain and analyze the quantum hall effect @xcite . in the c - c model ,",
    "the equipotential lines of the long - ranged disordered potential are regarded as the links of a network , while the saddle points of these equipotential lines are regarded as the nodes of this network .",
    "quantum tunneling at the nodes of the network is described by a @xmath0 scattering matrix * * s**@xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are reflection and transmission amplitude , respectively .",
    "they are real numbers and satisfy @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the asymmetric chalker - coddington network model .",
    "this is obtained from the standard c - c model by adding an extra channel in such a way that the number of incoming fluxes on one side of the system differs from that on the other side ( see fig . [ novelmodel ] ) .",
    "this leads to the creation of a single perfectly transmitting channel .",
    "we analyze the conductance distribution for the square geometry ( 2d ) , and the size dependence of the average conductance in both 2d and quasi - one dimensional ( quasi-1d ) geometries .",
    "the results are interpreted using random matrix theory and the repulsion of transmission eigenvalues from the perfectly transmitting channel .",
    "we emphasize that the asymmetry due to the addition of single channel dramatically changes the transport properties .",
    "this asymmetry can be realized in parallel hall bars where the contact does not touch one edge of a bar .",
    "another possibility is the transport in graphene , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) left ( right ) going and @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) right ( left ) going channels are realized near @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) point . for long ranged impurities , scattering between states near @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "is supressed , resulting in the asymmetic number of left and right going channels @xcite .",
    "from * * s**@xmath1 , we define a 2 by 2 transfer matrix * * t**@xmath1 that relates the currents in the left side of the node to those in the right , @xmath10 and then construct the full transfer matrix * t*. it consists of two types of transfer matrices .",
    "one is the transfer matrix ( see the left most column of nodes in fig .",
    "[ novelmodel ] ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a @xmath13 zero matrix , and the other is ( see the next column in fig . [ novelmodel ] ) @xmath14 here the new parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 describe scattering due to the addition of a new link . between the nodes , we assume that the electron wavefunctions acquire random phases @xmath17 , with @xmath18 uniform random numbers on @xmath19 . when the number of links in a layer is @xmath6",
    ", we need a set of @xmath6 independent random number @xmath20 .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath21 that relates current fluxes in the left side to that in the right side is @xmath22 where @xmath23 indicates @xmath23th layer , and @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the transfer matrix is then related to the reflection and transmission matrices @xcite .    to focus on the quantum hall critical point",
    ", we set @xmath25 . unless explicitly stated , we assume @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    before reporting our numerical results we describe the structure of the scattering matrix * s*. this matrix relates the incoming and outgoing particle flux amplitudes @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the incoming ( outgoing ) current flux amplitude in the left ( right ) side of the system .",
    "the @xmath30-matrix and @xmath31-matrix are @xmath32 and @xmath33 square matrices , respectively , while @xmath34 is @xmath35 and @xmath36 is @xmath37 . as a result ,",
    "both @xmath38 and @xmath21 have odd dimensions @xmath39 .",
    "the asymmetric c - c model is a type of quantum railroad @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless conductances @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 describe current from left to right and right to left , respectively . using the relationships obtained from the unitarity of the scattering matrix , @xmath43 and performing a singular value decomposition of @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are unitary matrices and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . taking its hermitian conjugate ,",
    "@xmath49 we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 note that the transmission eigenvalues are the same except for a single extra unit eigenvalue that appears in @xmath52 . as a result , the difference between @xmath41 and @xmath40 is always unity , @xmath53 we might expect that the conductance distribution simply shifts by unity but , as we show below , this expectation is too naive .    in the following ,",
    "we calculate the transmission matrix @xmath54 via the transfer matrix technique .",
    "the system width @xmath55 corresponds to the number of nodes in a column , while the system length @xmath56 to that in a row .",
    "the distribution of the conductance @xmath57 in 2d at the critical point is shown in fig .",
    "[ distribution ] .",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 samples have been realized .",
    "the conductance is always greater than unity as expected .",
    "the distribution has a kink at unity , and decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath57 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the unit eigenvalue repels the other eigenvalues .",
    "this behavior is profoundly different from that of the standard c - c model , where a broad distribution is found @xcite .      the averaged conductances @xmath60 for 2d and quasi-1d geometries are shown in figs .",
    "[ averagedcon ] and [ averagedcon2 ] . in the limit @xmath61",
    ", the conductance converges to a finite value of , approximately , @xmath62 for the 2d geometry ( fig .",
    "[ averagedcon ] ) and to unity for the quasi-1d geometry ( fig .",
    "[ averagedcon2 ] ) .",
    "we see that the asymmetric c - c model exhibits metallic behavior even for a long wire .",
    "this is again very different to the standard c - c model where the conductance converges to zero .",
    "also , the convergence to the limiting value is faster than that for the standard c - c model .",
    "this is consistent with predictions based on random matrix theory of an increase of the lyapunov exponents associated with localised channels due to the repulsion with the unit eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have proposed an asymmetric c - c model and analyzed its transport properties .",
    "we find that , even for a long wire , the conductance remains finite and the system is metallic .",
    "transmission eigenvalues are repelled by the unit eigenvalue resulting in an unusual form for the conductance distribution .",
    "we have also varied the coupling to the additional link , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "preliminary results suggest that conductance in sufficiently large systems is not sensitive to the choice of coupling , indicating that the observed transport phenomena are of bulk origin .",
