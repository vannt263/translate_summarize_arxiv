    "ground - state cooling of nano - mechanical resonators ( mrs ) has attracted great interests , as it is crucial in the improvement of detection precision of mrs  @xcite , observation of quantum behaviors of macroscopic mrs  @xcite , and quantum information processing based on mrs  @xcite . over the years",
    ", methods to optimize the cooling of mrs in optomechanical systems  @xcite ( or in electromechanical systems  @xcite ) have been studied extensively . in these cooling schemes ,",
    "the mr is coupled to a driven cavity through the optical radiation pressure and is cooled via the passive backaction cooling ( also called self - cooling )   @xcite without a feedback loop .",
    "more significantly , the backaction ground - state cooling of mr  @xcite , where the mean thermal occupation number of phonons @xmath0 is less than @xmath1 , can be achieved when the resolved sideband condition is satisfied .",
    "several experiments have reported progress in the backaction cooling of mr in optomechanical systems  @xcite , in particular those approaching ground states of mrs .",
    "recent research shows that mrs can be cooled to states with a mean thermal occupation number @xmath2 in an optical cavity  @xcite , and @xmath3 in a superconducting transmission line resonator  @xcite .",
    "most existing models for ground - state cooling of mr in optomechanical systems use resolved sideband cooling .",
    "the thermal phonon number of the mr is reduced by the interaction between the mr and high - frequency auxiliary systems until the whole system eventually reaches equilibrium . here",
    "we propose an alternative but efficient cooling method for mr in a three - mirror cavity ( 3mc ) optomechanical system  @xcite .",
    "we notice that the mr and its auxiliary system , e.g. , optical cavities , can be treated separately by the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "the mr therefore behaves as a single - mode harmonic oscillator whose effective frequency is determined by the external optical driving fields . by controlling the amplitude of optical driving fields , we can quickly reduce the frequency of the bare mr , e.g. , initially in a thermal equilibrium state , to a smaller effective frequency , but retaining the populations . in other words ,",
    "the mr is cooled in a shorter time by doing work on the external system .",
    "remarkably , by combining such a fast cooling scheme with another process , we find that it is feasible to achieve the _ ground - state cooling _ of the mr with final effective frequency that is the same as the bare one .",
    "our ground - state cooling mechanism is distinctly different from that of the conventional sideband cooling in optomechanical systems : ( i ) realization of sideband cooling requires a long time until a steady state is reached . here",
    "the mr may be cooled down to a non - steady state at a short time and may later become hotter again because of interactions with environment .",
    "( ii ) the optical driving field is time - independent in the sideband cooling , while the present scheme needs a time - dependent and much stronger optical power .",
    "( iii ) the sideband cooling of mr happens when the optical detuning @xmath4 approaches the bare frequency of mr @xmath5 , the cooling condition here is far detuned from the cavity ( @xmath6 ) , which greatly simplifies the requirement for experimental control of the optical detuning .",
    "( iv ) the decay rate of cavities in our scheme can be larger than the frequency of mr , while it is not allowed in resolved sideband cooling .",
    "unlike the conventional two - mirror cavity ( 2mc ) optomechanical system , we consider here an optomechanical system of 3mc configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "the mirror of mr with two perfectly reflecting surfaces is placed inside a cavity and the two other fixed mirrors are transmissive and subject to external optical drives .",
    "this setup is different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the mr is transmissive .",
    "the hamiltonian of 3mc system can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian for a mr with effective mass @xmath9 and bare eigenfrequency @xmath5 , and @xmath10 describes the optomechanical coupling between single - mode optical driven cavities a and b ( with the eigenfrequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ) and the mr . here",
    "@xmath13 are the amplitudes of external optical driving fields to the cavities with the corresponding drive frequencies @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding optomechanical coupling strengths via the radiation pressure , and @xmath17 are the lengths of the cavities @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "similar to the case for electrons and nuclei in a molecule , the eigenfrequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 of two cavities are much higher than the frequency @xmath5 of the mr such that the bo approximation can be employed to separate the degrees of freedom of mr from those of two cavities . for simplicity , but without loss of generality , we set @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the cavity hamiltonian can now be written as @xmath25 in a rotating frame with respect to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the optical detuning at the absence of the motion of the mr .",
    "we define operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , such that the hamiltonian  ( [ h - c ] ) can be expressed as @xmath32where @xmath33is @xmath34 dependent .",
    "note that we have used the condition @xmath35 and ignored the effects from the decay rates ( @xmath36 @xmath37 ) of cavity fields based on the fact that @xmath38 is much less than the detuning @xmath4 .",
    "when the cavity fields are fixed for the state @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the effective hamiltonian of the mr is @xmath43where the effective frequency is given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a constant shift .",
    "we have assumed that the induced gauge potential @xmath46 if @xmath47 is a real function",
    ". then the mr behaves as a harmonic oscillator with the effective frequency determined by @xmath48 ( equivalently the amplitudes of the optical driving fields ) , which is similar to the discussion according to the conventional optical springs  @xcite .",
    "the 3mc configuration distinguishes itself from the 2mc configuration because the high symmetry of the three - mirror cavity allows to significantly improve the trap stiffness and to partially remove the bistability as addressed in ref .",
    "the mr displacement in the effective hamiltonian  ( [ h - r - eff ] ) is zero , while the corresponding mr displacement is finite in the 2mc configuration , making the dynamics of the 2mc more complicated .",
    "although the effective hamiltonian  ( [ h - r - eff ] ) is obtained by using the time - independent bo approximation for the time - independent @xmath49 , the similar result also holds for a time - dependent parameter @xmath50 when the factor @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) varies very slowly in comparison with the detuning @xmath53 i.e. , @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", the schrdinger equation @xmath55 can be simplified by a similar bo approximation with a highly non - trivial consideration of time dependency , as discussed in ref .",
    "the bo approximation implies @xmath56 such that @xmath57 here @xmath58 is an instantaneous eigen wave - function of the mr with the effective hamiltonian @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the corresponding instantaneous eigenvalues and now is time dependent , @xmath61 .    based on the adiabatic theorem with conditions @xmath54 and the wave function @xmath39 being real , we obtain @xmath62 . the effective schrdinger equation for the mr is then given by @xmath63\\langle \\widetilde{0}|\\psi \\rangle = i\\hbar \\partial _ { t}\\langle \\widetilde{0}|\\psi",
    "\\rangle .\\]]therefore , the mr can be described as a time - dependent harmonic oscillator with the effective hamiltonian @xmath64here the corresponding time - dependent eigen - frequency @xmath65with @xmath66 , is controlled by the external optical field via the dimensionless function @xmath51 .",
    "the dynamics of a time - dependent harmonic oscillator is analytically solvable using lewis - reisenfeld invariants  @xcite .",
    "here we are only interested in the specific trajectories @xmath67 wherein the instantaneous populations at the initial time are the same as those at the final time , but the eigenfrequency and the corresponding average energy at the final time decreases .",
    "that means the harmonic oscillator has the same entropy at the initial and final times and is cooled by doing work on the external field , instead of having heat flowing out of it .",
    "such a cooling trajectory does not depend on the initial state . the simplest way to realize",
    "the cooling trajectory is the adiabatic process where the populations remain the same all the time .",
    "the disadvantage is that the adiabatic process needs a long time , during which the relaxation of the harmonic oscillator may bring negative effects .",
    "alternatively , an optimal bang - bang process has been proposed to achieve a cooling trajectory in a shorter time @xcite .",
    "the effective frequency is real and stepwise function of time in this process , where the final instantaneous populations of the mr remain the same as the initial ones in terms of controlling the step values and durations of the effective frequency . recently",
    "a fast optimal frictionless process  @xcite was proposed to achieve atom cooling by choosing a certain trajectory of effective frequency , wherein the instantaneous effective frequency is allowed to be imaginary \" .    employing these methods ,",
    "one is able to cool the mr in time - controllable optomechanical systems , as done in atom cooling  @xcite .",
    "let us estimate the feasibility of cooling a mr with reasonable empirical parameters : the bare eigenfrequency of mr @xmath68 khz , the effective mass @xmath69 pg  @xcite , the eigenfrequency of the optical cavity @xmath70 hz , the optical detuning @xmath71 hz , and the length of the optical cavity @xmath72 mm .",
    "the optical driving fields are controllable and can have the time - dependent form @xmath73 with @xmath74 hz and @xmath75 . with these parameters ,",
    "we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "the effective frequency @xmath77 can be much smaller than the bare frequency @xmath5 of the mr , or even be imaginary \" by tuning @xmath51 .",
    "specifically , consider a mr in the thermal state with the mean phonon occupation number @xmath78 $ ] @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) at the initial time @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "one can design a trajectory between @xmath83 and the much lower effective frequency @xmath84 at the final time ( where @xmath84@xmath85 with @xmath86 and the corresponding @xmath87 ) such that the final mean occupation number @xmath88 .",
    "the energy of the mr is decreased by a factor @xmath89 after doing work on the external field , and the final effective temperature is reduced to @xmath90 .",
    "we have proposed a fast cooling mechanism for the mr as a time - dependent effective harmonic oscillator in a 3mc optomechanical system , where the final effective frequency of the mr is different from the initial one .",
    "however , the approach will not lead to the ground - state cooling since the final mean population number of the effective harmonic oscillator is the same as the original one which is usually much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "in the preceding section , we obtain a fast cooling of mr wherein the final effective frequency of the mr is different from the initial one .",
    "people may be mostly interested in the cooling of the mr with the final effective frequency of the mr being ( nearly ) equal to the original bare one , such as the sideband cooling of mr . in this section",
    ", we design a different cooling approach for the same 3mc optomechanical system to cool the mr close to its ground state in a short time , with the final effective frequency of the mr being equal to the original bare one .",
    "we consider that the mr is originally ( at @xmath91 ) in a thermal equilibrium state @xmath92 in a bath at a refrigeration temperature @xmath93 mk  @xcite in the absence of the optical driving fields .",
    "the corresponding mean occupation number of thermal phonons is @xmath94 @xmath95\\gg 1 $ ] .",
    "the mr is then subject to the optical radiation pressure of the driven cavities , described by the effective hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ bo2 ] ) .",
    "we use the same preceding typical parameters , except with the optical detuning @xmath96 hz and with the maximum value of optical driving fields @xmath97 hz , and obtain @xmath98 . at time",
    "@xmath99 the mr evolves to a new thermal state @xmath100 with the mean thermal occupation number @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "we take @xmath102 such that @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "the intermediate trajectory between @xmath106 and @xmath81 may be arbitrary , on the condition that the mr is in the thermal state at time @xmath81 .",
    "we need to design a special trajectory of the effective frequency @xmath107 from @xmath99 to the final time @xmath108 such that @xmath109 equals to the original bare frequency @xmath5 and the corresponding state @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the final mean thermal occupation number @xmath111 , which indicates that the mr is cooled near its ground state .",
    "we now focus on designing such a trajectory of @xmath67 in terms of the lewis - riesenfeld invariant of motion  @xcite .",
    "the invariant of motion for our mr harmonic oscillator is @xmath112+[b(t)p - m\\dot{b}(t)x]^{2}/2 $ ] , where @xmath113 .",
    "the dimensional real function @xmath114 satisfies the condition @xmath115",
    "@xcite , which is used in ref .",
    "@xcite for cold atoms .",
    "we show that the simplest polynomial choice of @xmath116  @xcite will lead to an above - required cooling trajectory , which can be realized by controlling the parameters @xmath51 , as shown by the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "in addition , the cooling process could even be faster if _ imaginary _ frequencies @xmath67 could be allowed as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the imaginary frequencies cooling scheme were first proposed .",
    "the single optical mode hamiltonian  ( [ h - c2 ] ) fails to provide such imaginary values of @xmath107 since @xmath117 is positive for the fixed parameters above . for that purpose",
    ", we could adopt two optical modes in each cavity for the similar symmetric 3mc configuration . a self - adjoint _ hamiltonian _  @xcite for the model with two optical modes in each cavity in a rotating frame should be @xmath118,\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) denote the annihilation operators for the two modes in cavity @xmath18 ( cavity @xmath19 ) with the frequencies @xmath121 .",

    "the optical detunings are @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "following the preceding discussion , the effective time - dependent hamiltonian for the mr becomes @xmath131where the time - dependent eigenfrequency is given by @xmath132   \\label{frequency - eff - prime}\\]]with two coefficients @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we now have more effective control over the time - dependent eigenfrequency @xmath135 through two independent parameters @xmath136 ( proportional to the external input optical powers ) and will use the same typical parameters for both modes as before , except for the optical frequencies @xmath137 hz , @xmath138 hz , the maximum amplitude of optical driving fields @xmath139 hz , @xmath140 hz , and the detunings @xmath141 hz and @xmath142 hz . therefore , the coefficients @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "thus , the effective frequency could be imaginary in the process when @xmath145 is much larger than @xmath146 and the cooling can be achieved even faster ( see the blue dotted and dashed - dotted lines in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we wish to mention that our ground - state cooling scheme requires a strong input optical power to obtain a strong modulation for the effective frequency .",
    "the maximum value of the optical input power is @xmath147 w for the maximum @xmath148 hz , where the decay rate of the optical modes of the cavities is assumed as @xmath149 hz .",
    "the corresponding high finesse cavities with @xmath150 , are required .",
    "we remark that the adiabatic condition for the time - dependent bo approximation , @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) of mr from @xmath153 to @xmath154 for different durations : @xmath155 ( blue dotted line ) ; @xmath156 ( black solid line ) ; @xmath157 ( red dashed line ) . here , the bare frequency of mr is @xmath158 khz .",
    "the negative value is due to an imaginary @xmath159 which appears for the case of short evolution time @xmath160 .",

    "even if the coupling between the mr and the optical cavity is removed by shutting off the optical driving fields , the mr will remain in the same ground state for a longer time after @xmath160 , until it approaches to a new thermal equilibrium with its bath . during this period of time",
    ", one can perform quantum operations , such as quantum information processing , on the mr .",
    "note that the controlled trajectory between @xmath165 and @xmath166 is preformed in a short time of a fraction of @xmath167 , such that the relaxation process of the mr with a high q factor ( e.g. , @xmath168 ) can be ignored .",
