    "an overview of applications of the cgl equation is provided in the review article by cross and hohenberg @xcite .",
    "the importance of the cgl equation stems from the fact that it provides a generic description of the slow modulation of oscillations in a spatially - extended system near a hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the cgl equation exhibits a rich range of dynamical behavior with variation of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the `` phase diagram '' has been investigated ( mostly numerically ) by various authors @xcite . in a large range of parameter space ,",
    "the emergence and interaction of spiral ( and antispiral ) defects plays an important role in determining the morphology .",
    "our present work focuses on characterizing pattern formation in the cgl equation using spiral - defect structures .",
    "we have analytically and numerically studied nonequilibrium dynamics in the cgl equation with @xmath8 .",
    "typically , we consider the evolution morphology resulting from a small - amplitude random initial condition . there has been intense research interest in such problems in the context of far - from - equilibrium statistical physics  for reviews , see @xcite .",
    "the simplest problem in this class considers a homogeneous two - phase mixture , which has been rendered thermodynamically unstable by a rapid quench below the critical co - existence temperature .",
    "an example of such a system is a 2-state ferromagnet ( in zero magnetic field ) at high temperatures , which consists of a homogeneous mixture of `` up '' and `` down '' spins .",
    "however , below the critical temperature , the system prefers to be in a spontaneously - magnetized state .",
    "the evolution of the system from the unstable initial state is a complex nonlinear process . in appropriate dimensionless units ,",
    "this evolution is described by the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation , i.e. , eq .",

    "the domain growth law is @xmath11 , which is referred to as the lifshitz - cahn - allen ( lca ) law @xcite .",

    "the present two - stage exposition focuses on phase ordering dynamics in the cgl equation with @xmath8 . furthermore , the analytical and numerical results presented here are for the @xmath20-dimensional case , where spirals are point defects .",
    "however , the analytical results obtained by us can be easily extended to the case with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as the underlying paradigm remains the same , i.e. , spiral defects still determine the morphology in large regions of parameter space and for higher dimensionality .    following the work of hagan @xcite , aranson _",

    "details of our simulation techniques and comprehensive numerical results will be provided in paper @xmath1 .",
    "figure 1 is shown here only to motivate our subsequent discussion .",
    "we would like to quantitatively characterize the evolution morphology shown in figure @xmath36 .",

    "( the momentum - space structure factor is obtained as the fourier transform of the real - space correlation function . ) at the simplest level of approximation , the morphology in the frames of figure @xmath36 can be interpreted as consisting of disjoint spirals , each of size @xmath35 .",
    "( of course , this overlooks modulations of the order - parameter field at spiral - spiral boundaries , but we will discuss that later . ) therefore , it is obviously of relevance to compute the correlation function for a single - spiral solution",
    ".    the cgl equation with @xmath8 has been studied by hagan @xcite , who found that there is a family of spiral solutions with the following functional form ( in @xmath23 ) : @xmath37 , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 ; @xmath39 is a constant which is determined uniquely as a function of @xmath7 ; and @xmath40 is the number of arms in the spiral . the cases with @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to a spiral and antispiral , respectively .",
    "the limiting forms of the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are @xmath45 where the constant @xmath46 is determined by finiteness conditions .",

    "we recover scaling only in the limit @xmath52 ( @xmath24 ) , which corresponds to the case of a vortex .",

    "however , there is now a sequence of sub - dominant singularities proportional to @xmath141 , @xmath142 , etc . , and these become increasingly important as the length scale @xmath35 increases .",
    "these sub - dominant terms in @xmath143 are reminiscent of the leading - order singularities in models with @xmath14 symmetry , where @xmath100 is even @xcite . of course",
    ", in the context of @xmath14 models , these singularities only arise for @xmath16 as there are no topological defects unless this condition is satisfied . in the present context ,",
    "all these terms are already present for @xmath23 .",
    "the implication for the structure - factor tail is a sequence of power - law decays with @xmath144 , where @xmath48 , etc .",
    "thus , though the true asymptotic behavior in @xmath23 is still the generalized porod tail , @xmath145 , it may be difficult to disentangle this from other power - law decays .",
    "the results presented in this section are of relevance in determining the small - distance behavior of the correlation function , or the large - wavevector behavior of the structure factor .",
    "this is because small length - scales only probe individual defects",
    ". nevertheless , as our numerical results in paper ii will demonstrate , the single - spiral correlation function agrees with the correlation function for multi - spiral morphologies ( obtained numerically ) over a considerable range of distances . for even larger length - scales",
    ", we have to explicitly account for the modulation of the order parameter at defect - defect boundaries .",
    "we address this problem in the next section of this paper .",
    "the evolution in figure 1 is characterized by a morphology with multiple spirals and anti - spirals .",
    "initially , spirals and anti - spirals are attracted to each other and annihilate , thereby decreasing the defect density and increasing the inter - defect distance ( or characteristic length scale ) .",
    "when the defect density is large , the spiral sizes are small and spirals are similar to vortices .",
    "therefore , we expect an initial coarsening regime which is analogous to that for the xy model  both in terms of the domain growth law , @xmath146 @xcite ; and the morphology , as characterized by the correlation function @xcite .",
    "this is in accordance with our numerical simulations , as we discuss in paper ii .",
    "distinctive effects of spirals are seen for length scales @xmath147 , where @xmath148  clearly , @xmath149 as @xmath150 ( or @xmath151 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a repulsive spiral - antispiral potential beyond a certain distance , which prevents the annealing of all defects @xcite .",
    "thus , the evolving system `` freezes '' ( in a statistical sense ) into a multi - spiral morphology .",
    "this should be contrasted with the case of the dynamical xy model ( @xmath152 in eq .",
    "( [ cgl ] ) ) , where we expect the zero - temperature system to continue coarsening as @xmath153 .",
    "a common theme in the characterization of dynamical evolution with a nonconserved order parameter is the introduction of a gaussian auxiliary field ( gaf ) @xcite .",
    "essentially , the gaf ansatz takes the form @xmath154 $ ] , where the function @xmath155 $ ] is determined from the defect structure , and the complex field @xmath40 ( which measures the location relative to the defect core ) is assumed to obey a gaussian distribution .",
    "the zero - crossings of the field @xmath40 correspond to the location of defect cores .",
    "the gaf ansatz enables a straightforward computation of the correlation function for the field @xmath3 .",
    "however , the analytical justification for the gaf ansatz is meagre and its primary virtue appears to be that it works rather well in some situations @xcite .    let us examine the utility of the gaf ansatz in the present context .",
    "the appropriate form of the ansatz for the cgl equation in the regime where the spiral structures are well - developed is ( using hagan s solution for the spiral defect ) @xmath156 ; and we take @xmath157 near the defect core ( @xmath158 ) , in accordance with hagan s solution .",
    "the field @xmath159 is assumed to obey a gaussian distribution with @xmath160 where @xmath161 ; and the fields @xmath162 and @xmath163 are taken to be statistically independent of each other .",
    "our numerical results show that the gaf ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ gaf ] ) is reasonable in the vicinity of defects .",
    "however , it is inappropriate for defect - defect boundaries , where the order - parameter amplitude @xmath164 is often larger than @xmath165",
    ". this is demonstrated in figure 4 , which replots figure 1 with defect locations marked by asterisks ; and regions where @xmath166 marked in black . as discussed before , for early times ( e.g. , @xmath167 ) ,",
    "the system evolution is governed by the interaction of vortices .",
    "thus , the appropriate gaf ansatz should have max(@xmath168 , as in the case of the xy model . for late times",
    "( e.g. , @xmath169 ) , the system has well - developed spirals . nevertheless , the gaf ansatz for the order - parameter field is obviously inappropriate for large regions of space at these parameter values . for other values of @xmath7 ,",
    "the same general arguments apply though there are changes in the crossover time to spiral - mediated growth ; and the fraction of spatial region where the gaf ansatz is unreasonable .",
    "let us examine the validity of the gaf ansatz in regions where @xmath170 .",
    "we can simplify the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ gaf ] ) by defining the variable @xmath171 , where @xmath172 .",

    "( [ gf ] ) .",
    "the data collapses onto a single master curve , which is reasonably approximated by the gaussian form @xmath196 , denoted as a solid line in figure 5(b ) .",
    "figure 5 has been obtained by focusing only on regions where @xmath170 , which is essentially equivalent to considering disjoint spirals , for which the correlation function has already been obtained in section ii .",

    "we have also studied some other possible ways of rectifying the gaf ansatz .",
    "we find that these ad - hoc approaches invariably result in non - gaussian distributions for the auxiliary field .",
    "perhaps a more honest approach should be based on the order - parameter field for spiral - spiral pairs @xcite as a function of two independent auxiliary fields  referring to distances from the centers of the two spirals .",
    "we are presently studying the utility of such an approach for characterizing the multi - spiral morphology .",
    "let us conclude this paper with a brief summary and discussion of our results .",
    "we have undertaken a detailed analytical and numerical investigation of nonequilibrium dynamics in a special case of the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation .",
    "our results are described in a two - stage exposition .",
    "this paper ( referred to as @xmath0 ) constitutes the first stage of this exposition , and describes analytical results for the time - dependent correlation function .",
    "our analytical arguments rely on the significance of spiral - defect structures in determining the morphology and evolution of the cgl equation from a random initial condition .    in this paper",
    ", we describe results for the exact correlation function @xmath108 of a single spiral defect of size @xmath35 , and undertake its asymptotic analysis in the limit @xmath200 but @xmath201 , where @xmath84 is the size of the defect core .",
    "we find that there is a sequence of singularities in this limit , which are reminiscent of singularities for defects with @xmath14 symmetry , where @xmath100 is even .",
    "however , the dominant singularity as @xmath200 corresponds to the case of vortex defects , as expected .",
    "the implications for the large - wavevector tail of the structure factor are also discussed .",
    "we also investigate the validity of the gaussian auxiliary field ( gaf ) ansatz in the context of multi - spiral morphologies .",
    "for early times ( @xmath202 ) , domain growth in the cgl equation is analogous to that for the xy model , whose domain growth law and correlation function are well understood @xcite . for later times , we find that the simple gaf ansatz is not reasonable , as it is unable to account for order - parameter modulations in the defect - defect boundaries .",
    "we have attempted ad - hoc improvements of the gaf ansatz but these invariably result in non - gaussian distributions for the corresponding auxiliary field .",
    "we are presently investigating the possibility of formulating a generalized gaf ansatz in terms of the order - parameter field for a spiral - spiral pair .",
    "more generally , the utility of the gaf ansatz arises from the summation over phases from many defects , which results in a near - gaussian distribution for the auxiliary field .",
    "however , in the present context , the shocks between spirals effectively isolate one spiral region from the influence of other regions . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the waves from other spirals decay exponentially through the shock and the phase of a point is always dominated by the nearest spiral .",
    "therefore , we expect that the correlation function will be dominated by the single - spiral result  in accordance with our numerical results",
    ".    the next paper in this exposition ( referred to as @xmath1 ) will present detailed numerical results for phase ordering dynamics in the cgl equation .",
    "in particular , we will focus upon the crossover from vortex - mediated dynamics ( at early times ) to spiral - mediated dynamics ( at late times ) .",
    "furthermore , we will compare our numerical results for the correlation function of the order - parameter field with the analytic form for a single - spiral defect presented in this paper .    before we conclude this paper , it is worth stressing that the results presented are easily adaptable to the general case of the cgl equation with @xmath203 .",
    "again , the evolving morphology in a large region of parameter space is characterized by the presence and annihilation of spirals and anti - spirals @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper apply directly in that case also , with minor modifications in the functional forms of the spiral solution in section @xmath1 .",
