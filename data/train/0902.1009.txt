    "while trying to explain an unexpected increase of thermal resistance in the intermediate state of type - i superconductors , in 1964 andreev @xcite discovered that there must be an additional scattering at interfaces between normal and superconducting domains .",
    "its microscopic process was precisely derived by solving the boundary condition problem using bogoliubov - de gennes equations .",
    "the hidden scattering is retroreflection of an electron as a hole as it approaches an n / s interface from the n side .",
    "this particle - hole conversion process , called andreev reflection , is essentially a scattering off a superconducting pair potential , during which energy , momentum and spin are conserved .",
    "the missing electronic charge is transferred as a cooper pair into the superconductor , doubling the conductance within the energy gap , @xmath17 .",
    "a schematic of this process is depicted in figure  [ fig : ar ] . if the normal metal is replaced with a ferromagnet , ar is suppressed since the dos for the opposite spin band is severely reduced ( see figure  [ fig : ar](b ) with unbalanced spin bands in n ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been extensively utilized to measure the spin polarization of ferromagnetic materials @xcite .",

    "( a ) a real space picture .",
    "n and s denote a normal - metal and superconducting electrode , respectively .",
    "( b ) a picture in the e ( energy ) vs. dos space when the s is biased positively .",
    "the dashed line indicates the fermi level .",
    "an electron incoming from the n side , impinging on the n / s interface , is retroreflected as a hole and get paired with another electron with opposite spin and momentum , transferring as a cooper pair into the superconductor over a region @xmath18 ( superconducting coherence length ) near the interface .",
    "note that energy , momentum , spin and charge ( including a cooper pair ) are conserved in this process . ]    at about the same time as andreev formulated the occurrence of ar , de gennes and saint - james @xcite considered a similar boundary condition problem in an n / s bilayer system and discovered that the quasiparticle dos is modified by the induced bound states .",
    "although such ar - related effects had been known for a long time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ar was not considered as a direct measure of the superconducting energy gap until a theory came out in 1982 . while studying the charge transport properties of n / s and s",
    "/ n / s junctions , blonder , tinkham and klapwijk ( btk ) came up with an elegant theoretical formulation to explain various characteristics in a unified model @xcite .",
    "they considered a boundary condition problem with a delta - function potential barrier at an n / s interface , @xmath19 , and the quasiparticle energy in the superconductor determined by the bogoliubov - de gennes equations .",
    "for an incoming electron impinging on the n / s interface from the n side , there are four possible trajectories : normal reflection , ar as a hole , transmission into the same branch and transmission with a branch crossing . in the btk theory ,",
    "the differential conductance across an n / s interface is given by the following formula .",

    "a remarkable aspect of this model is that it can reproduce characteristic conductance features from ar to tunneling as a function of single parameter , @xmath28 , the dimensionless barrier strength .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : sbtk ] for an @xmath29-wave superconductor as calculated by ( [ eq : btk ] ) . for a purely metallic junction ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "the subgap conductance is doubled with respect to the normal state value , which is due to 100% probability of ar for @xmath31 . with increasing @xmath32 ,",
    "a double - peak structure develops and the conductance at zero bias decreases , both features due to the energy dependence of ar probability . for a large @xmath32 value , say , @xmath33 , ar is almost suppressed and the conductance shape is dominated by single particle tunneling . in this limit ,",
    "the tunneling conductance maps out the quasiparticle dos which , in the strong coupling case , may contain information on the bosonic modes mediating the cooper pairing @xcite .",
    "since ar is a scattering off a pair potential , it is sensitive to the phase coherency of the cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "thus , ar measurements on unconventional superconductors may give different information than tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "this is an important issue that has been debated actively in the case of high-@xmath14 cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "( a ) current vs. voltage and ( b ) normalized di / dv vs. voltage characteristics calculated by the btk formula for a normal - metal / s - wave superconductor junction at @xmath13=0 .",

    "@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the normal state resistance of a purely metallic junction . in the ar regime , an excess current",
    "is observed , which is the intercept obtained when the high - bias part of an i - v curve is extrapolated to the y - axis .",
    "note that the btk theory reproduces the transitional behaviour from ar to tunneling with a single parameter , @xmath32 , the dimensionless barrier strength . ]    in an effort to analyze the conductance data obtained from nb / cu point - contact junctions , blonder and tinkham introduced a second term into the barrier strength parameter as follows @xcite .",

    "they observed that the fitting parameter @xmath40 ranged @xmath41 and interpreted that the minimum value of 0.3 is consistent with the @xmath40 value calculated by ( [ eq : barrierz ] ) using @xmath42 for nb / cu and assuming no insulating barrier ( @xmath32=0 ) .",
    "our experimental data on dozens of nb / au ( @xmath43 @xcite ) point - contact junctions over a range of sample - tip pressures have shown that @xmath44 .",
    "this indicates that it may not be justified to extract the fermi velocity mismatch contribution from the obtained @xmath40 values , contrary to their interpretation and to the claim by deutscher and nozires @xcite that one can determine the mass enhancement factor by comparing velocities obtained from pcs with known values .",
    "regarding this issue , lukic considered generalized boundary conditions in the btk problem and argued that the effective mass is just a parameterization of the unknown microscopic parameters @xcite .    in heavy - fermion materials ,",
    "the electronic mass is highly enhanced ( by an order of @xmath45 ) with a correspondingly reduced fermi velocity . according to ( [ eq : barrierz ] ) , a junction with a heavy fermion as one electrode and a conventional metal as",
    "the other is inherently in the tunneling regime ( e.g. , @xmath46 for au / cecoin@xmath0 ) and thus ar can not occur .",
    "however , ar has been frequently observed in such junctions as we present our data below and as observed by others ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "deutscher and nozires addressed this discrepancy by proposing that the boundary conditions are not affected by the mass enhancement factor @xcite .",
    "these issues are further discussed in section 7 .",
    "detailed reviews on this topic have been published , e.g. , @xcite . here",
    "we only present fundamental concepts and elements of pcs .",
    "let us begin by considering electrical conduction across a metallic contact between two identical metal electrodes .",
    "assume the two metals are connected only through a constriction of radius @xmath47 and otherwise electrically isolated .",
    "if a bias voltage is applied across the junction , the resulting conductance will depend on how the electric field distributes in the contact region . here",
    ", the most relevant length scales are the electronic mean free paths , elastic ( @xmath48 ) and inelastic ( @xmath49 ) , in comparison to the contact radius @xmath47 . if @xmath50 , electrons gain or lose energy only when crossing the interface and their velocity change is proportional to the applied voltage .",
    "this gives rise to an ohmic current - voltage characteristic and the contact resistance is given by the following formula , known as sharvin resistance @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the resistivity of the metal .",
    "this limit ( @xmath50 ) is called ballistic or sharvin limit .",
    "note that the resistance depends only on the contact area since the product @xmath53 is constant in the simplest drude picture . in the opposite limit ,",
    "namely , if @xmath54 , the electron distribution would be that as in the bulk .",
    "then , the point - contact resistance is given by the formula for a bulk sample of length @xmath55 and diameter @xmath56 @xcite , except for a geometric factor : @xmath57 this limit ( @xmath54 ) is called the thermal or maxwell limit and a local joule heating can predominate the electrical transport process .    by solving boltzmann transport equations for a point - contact junction with an arbitrary value for @xmath58 , wexler derived a generalized formula for the point - contact resistance as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath59 , \\label{eq : wexler}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a smooth function of @xmath61 . the intermediate region between ballistic and thermal regimes",
    "is called the diffusive regime , where @xmath62 and electrons undergo multiple elastic scattering across the constriction . in the case of an n / s point - contact junction",
    ", this may reduce the ar signal . in figure",
    "[ fig : pcsregime ] , the three regimes are indicated in relation to the contact size and mean free paths .",
    "an extreme limit , not relevant to the pcs discussed in this paper , can occur if the contact size becomes comparable to the fermi wavelength , in which case quantum size effects dominate @xcite .",
    "this regime is reached in atomic size quantum point contacts @xcite .",
    "schematic of the pcs regimes .",
    "@xmath47 is the radius of a point contact and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the elastic ( inelastic ) mean free path of electrons in the electrodes .",
    "ballistic : @xmath50 .",
    "diffusive : @xmath62 .",
    "thermal : @xmath54 . ]",
    "if a point - contact junction is in the ballistic limit , energy - dependent quasiparticle scatterings appear as nonlinearities in the current - voltage characteristics , analysis of which gives spectroscopic information of the material under study .",
    "what makes this pcs possible is that the contact area remains cold due to a large mean free path compared with the contact size and any energy dissipation occurs away from the junction .",
    "in contrast , in the thermal regime , energy dissipation occurs within the contact volume , causing local heating .",
    "this pcs technique was first demonstrated by yanson in 1974 in his second harmonic measurements of micro - shorted thin film tunnel junctions @xcite , from which he obtained phonon spectrum in pb , similar to that obtained in the tunneling measurements by mcmillan and rowell @xcite .",
    "shortly after , jansen and coworkers developed a more controllable method to make point - contact junctions @xcite .",
    "this technique , called the ` spear - anvil ' method , has been adopted most widely for pcs because of its simplicity . during its early days",
    ", pcs was mostly utilized to investigate phonon spectra in metals and alloys @xcite .",
    "since the btk theory came out @xcite to explain the experimental data nicely @xcite , pcs has been frequently adopted as an alternative tool to planar tunneling or sts for the study of superconducting gap structures of many novel and unconventional superconductors owing to its versatility and technical simplicity @xcite . in the majority of pcs experiments on superconductors , the differential conductance vs. bias voltage data have been analyzed successfully using the btk model to determine their superconducting order parameters .",
    "there exist many reports in the literature where the pcs data may not necessarily be spectroscopic .",
    "as discussed above , for purely spectroscopic measurements , the junction must be in the ballistic regime .",
    "a first check of this is to estimate junction size using ( [ eq : wexler ] ) and compare with known values for the mean free paths .",
    "because in general point - contact junctions are made by bringing two metals into mechanical contact on the nanoscale , data can also be affected by factors other than the nominal contact size , such as contact pressure @xcite and geometry @xcite , meaning that the nominal contact size being in the ballistic limit alone can not guarantee the spectroscopic nature of the data .",
    "the most important diagnostic is the reproducibility and consistency of the conductance spectra point to point , sample to sample and along different crystallographic orientations , as we discuss in the next three sections .",
    "like for other class of superconductors , the spear - anvil method has been employed widely for the pcs investigation of heavy - fermion superconductors .",
    "their much lower @xmath14 s ( typically less than 1 - 2 k ) make its implementation complicated because of the inevitable involvement of a @xmath63he or dilution refrigerator . in these cases , a purely mechanical approach of the tip to the sample based on the differential screw mechanism , which is widely adopted for @xmath64he systems ,",
    "is not suitable . instead , a combination of mechanical and piezoelectric adjustments is more common , where a coarse approach is made by a fine - pitched screw and a fine adjustment is made by driving piezoelectric elements @xcite .",
    "although mechanically cut wires ( typically au or pt - ir ) have been used , electrochemically polished tips provide better control over the tip size and surface morphology .",
    "this is an important technical issue since it could affect the contact geometry and thus the conductance spectra .",
    "it is also crucial to prepare smooth and clean sample surfaces in order to obtain spectroscopic data .",
    "almost all materials investigated by pcs have surface layers that are not the same as in bulk .",
    "these layers could be precipitates from growth , surface reconstruction or due to oxide growth when exposed to air . in some cases",
    ", these layers can be penetrated by the metal tip during the tip approach , enabling one to probe bulk characteristics . otherwise , the surface layer can act as a potential barrier , proximity or degraded layer .",
    "if the surface layer is thin , the potential barrier case will still provide spectroscopic data which can be analyzed by the btk theory , but approaching , or in , the tunneling limit . in the other two cases , obtaining spectroscopic data",
    "is more difficult , particularly if the surface layer is thick on the order of the coherence length or longer .",
    "it is ideal if a superconductor under study can be prepared such that it has flat and smooth surfaces along all major crystallographic orientations .",
    "most unconventional superconductors are first produced in bulk ( poly- or single - crystalline ) forms .",
    "pcs on polycrystals can reveal some information on the gap values but the momentum direction is not identified or defined well , meaning that data analysis and interpretation might not provide crystallographic orientation - dependent information .",
    "in addition , because of a granular structure , measured data are vulnerable to artificial effects such as intergrain josephson coupling @xcite .",
    "thus , single crystalline samples are highly desirable .",
    "a drawback , particularly in anisotropic materials , is that crystals are often grown as platelets only along the preferred surface orientations .",
    "thin film samples can be grown along desired directions by adjusting growth conditions but heavy - fermion compounds are known to be extremely difficult to synthesize in thin film form . for pcs , we rely on the high - quality single crystals that have been grown and the preferred as - grown surface of a single crystal is first investigated . for measurements along the other directions ,",
    "broken edges are frequently used .",
    "preparation of surfaces by polishing is rarely adopted due to the possibility of surface degradation during the polishing process . however , this approach for sample preparation has been successful for the ar study of cecoin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the heavy - fermion compound cecoin@xmath0 has a tetragonal crystal structure with the ce atoms occupying the basal plane .",
    "many experimental reports have pointed to a @xmath15-wave symmetry of the cooper pairing state @xcite .",
    "considering its known fermi surfaces @xcite , the gap nodes are supposed to form lines along the @xmath65-axis , similarly to the case of cuprate superconductors . from the group theoretical point of view on the possible pairing state",
    ", there is a correspondence between real and momentum space regarding the gap node directions in @xmath15-wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to make pcs measurements into the @xmath66 plane to probe along nodal and antinodal directions .",
    "more specifically , measurements into ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces should be made to identify the location of nodes .",
    "the largest face ( typically ranges a few mm ) of an as - grown cecoin@xmath0 crystal is perpendicular to the @xmath65-axis .",
    "thus , this surface is naturally chosen for pcs along the @xmath65-axis .",
    "since the thickness of single crystals ranges only a few hundred @xmath67 s , it is necessary to devise a method to hold a sample securely such that its in - plane direction is aligned with the tip axis .",
    "this can be achieved by embedding a crystal into a mold made of low - temperature epoxy and cutting and polishing it @xcite .",
    "cecoin@xmath0 crystals are grown by the flux method using excess indium flux @xcite .",
    "because of the nature of this method , samples can contain indium precipitates , which may affect the pcs measurements . to eliminate this possibility , one slightly etches crystals using hydrochloric acid , noting that cecoin@xmath0 is also dissolved although at much slower rate than indium .",
    "microscopically rough surfaces can therefore be produced , causing spurious effects .",
    "again , to ensure the spectroscopic nature of the conductance spectra , reproducibility is the most important diagnostic . in particular , data should be compared along all major crystallographic orientations .",
    "in general , considering the extreme cleanness of cecoin@xmath0 ( the electronic mean free path ranges several @xmath68 s at low temperature @xcite ) , it is highly feasible to perform pcs measurements in the ballistic regime .",
    "three independent groups have reported results of pcs on cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "et al_. @xcite first reported two different types of conductance spectra obtained from point contacts along the @xmath65-axis : one with double - peak and zero - bias dip structure , and the other with a zero - bias peak and surrounding dips .",
    "the latter feature was interpreted as hinting at an unconventional symmetry ( @xmath15-wave was implied ) .",
    "et al_. @xcite also reported two different types of spectra from nominally @xmath65-axis contacts : one with a zero - bias peak and hump structure , and the other with a double hump structure .",
    "these authors claimed both @xmath15-wave symmetry and multiple order parameter components .",
    "the validity of the claim for @xmath15-wave symmetry based simply on the observation of a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) has been questioned @xcite because many other origins for a zbcp are also known .",
    "figure  [ fig : dbtk ] shows normalized di / dv curves calculated for a normal - metal/@xmath15-wave superconductor junction using the kernel developed by tanaka and kashiwaya _ et al . _ @xcite as a function of @xmath40 , the effective barrier strength in ( [ eq : barrierz ] ) .",
    "here , it is assumed that the injected electrons have a momentum distribution over the whole range of angle ( 90 @xmath69 ) around the junction normal . in practice , in the tunneling limit ,",
    "tunneling electrons may have a much narrower momentum distribution , known as tunneling cone effect @xcite . in the limit of a 90 degree tunneling cone ,",
    "there is no difference between the @xmath65-axis , nodal or antinodal directions as there is an integration over the full half space of momentum , as shown in figures  [ fig : dbtk ] . for an antinodal or @xmath65-axis junction , the cusp - like feature and linear slope near zero bias for purely metallic ( @xmath70 ) and tunnel junctions ( @xmath71 ) , respectively , exhibit the characteristic dos of a @xmath15-wave superconductor",
    "this is just a qualitative difference from the @xmath29-wave case , where a flat conductance shape is seen due to a fully isotropic opening of the gap . as @xmath40",
    "is increased from zero , a double - peak and zero - bias dip structure develops , which is also similar to the @xmath29-wave case ( see figure  [ fig : sbtk](b ) ) .",
    "an interesting case is the nodal direction with a finite @xmath40 .",
    "the conductance shape varies in a strikingly different way , as displayed in figure  [ fig : dbtk](b ) .",
    "beginning with the same shape for @xmath70 as for the antinodal junction , the conductance curve becomes narrower and sharper with increasing @xmath40 , forming a zbcp instead of a dip .",
    "this zbcp originates from andreev bound states ( abs ) formed on the nodal surface due to a sign change of the @xmath15-wave order parameter around the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the zbcp in tunnel junctions on hole - doped cuprate superconductors , well known to be @xmath15-wave , has been frequently observed @xcite and well understood theoretically @xcite .",
    "the abs occurs due to the constructive interference between an incoming electron and an andreev - reflected hole and can be formed at zero energy on a nodal surface of a @xmath15-wave superconductor because of the additional phase shift of @xmath72 @xcite .",

    "normalized di / dv vs. voltage characteristics calculated by the extended btk formula for a normal - metal/@xmath15-wave superconductor junction at @xmath13=0 .",
    "( a ) the junction normal is along the antinodal direction .",
    "the conductance behaviour is qualitatively similar to the @xmath29-wave case except for the cusp - like ( ar ) and v - shape ( tunneling ) features near zero bias , which are due to a @xmath15-wave superconducting dos . ( b ) the junction normal is along the nodal direction .",
    "completely different behaviours are observed due to the surface andreev bound states . ]",
    "it has been frequently claimed that a zbcp observed from pcs is a signature of abs , thus , evidence for a sign change of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "however , as pointed out by us @xcite , and sheet and raychaudhuri @xcite , just an observation of a zbcp does not corroborate such claims .",
    "a zbcp can also arise from other physical mechanisms without requiring a sign change such as local heating @xcite , intergrain josephson coupling @xcite , etc .",
    "therefore , it is essential to perform diagnostic measurements and analyses in order to prove that a zbcp is a real signature of abs . in the high-@xmath14 cuprate tunnel junctions , it is well established that abs - originated zbcps are split either spontaneously or by applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "one of the broadly accepted explanations is the doppler shift of the bound state energy due to coupling to the superfluid momentum @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of an abs - originated zbcp is predicted to follow 1/@xmath13 dependence , in contrast with the ln@xmath13 behaviour of kondo scattering effect in tunnel junctions . in the case of metallic junctions as in pcs",

    "although our qualitative analysis of the point - contact conductance spectra using the @xmath15-wave btk model gives spectroscopic evidence for the superconducting order parameter symmetry in cecoin@xmath0 , it does not give us precise information on the gap amplitude . as discussed previously ,",
    "existing models taking the fermi surface mismatch and possible breakdown of andreev approximation in heavy fermions into consideration do not quantitatively account for our data .",

    "also , there is a systematic evolution of this background conductance peak position as shown in figure  [ fig : asymmvst](b ) : it moves from the far - negative bias side towards zero bias with decreasing temperature .",

    "the conductance asymmetry can not be explained by the models proposed in the literature .",
    "certainly the asymmetry indicates it is easier to remove electrons from than to add to the heavy - fermion electrode cecoin@xmath0 .",

    "however , this model does nt agree with our experimental data on 1 - 1 - 5 heavy fermions @xcite .",
    "a simple counter argument to this scenario is why the asymmetry persists in the superconducting state as seen in figure  [ fig : pcs001](a ) , where the seebeck effect disappears @xcite and , thus , the asymmetry should , too .",
    "anders and gloos proposed that both the conductance asymmetry and reduced ar in heavy - fermion superconductors could be caused by the strongly energy - dependent quasiparticle scattering and dos of heavy fermions @xcite .",
    "this theory does account for our observed conductance features but , since the calculations are done in a green s function formalism , the microscopic physical mechanism is not obvious .",
    "nowack and klug @xcite used boltzmann transport equations to deal with electronic scattering by an energy - dependent dos of heavy fermions . in this model ,",

    "in essence , it is a manifestation of an interference effect between waves that have passed through two different paths containing discrete and continuum states , respectively .",

    "first , how is it possible to observe a fano resonance from point - contact ( not tunneling ) measurements and from the kondo lattice systems ? regarding this issue , we note that there is an example @xcite where continuous evolution of the fano resonance across a tunneling - metallic junction boundary is observed from stm measurements on single adatoms .",
    "this implies that it may also be possible in pcs .",
    "however , one should note a configurational difference between the kondo lattice and single adatoms since in the latter the fano ( kondo ) resonance is widely known to be sensitive to the environment around the impurity atom .",
    "second , what is the origin of the interference ? in the two - fluid picture of heavy fermions @xcite , there are two components in the electronic spectra in cecoin@xmath0 : one is the heavy electron liquid and the other is conduction electrons that do not participate in the hybridization .",
    "then , one can imagine that the interference occurs between these two channels @xcite . according to the theoretical derivation by madhavan _",
    "@xcite , the fano parameter @xmath93 is given by the ratio of two matrix elements : @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the coupling to a local orbital either direct or indirect via hybridization and @xmath112 is the coupling to the conduction electron continuum .",
    "it is to be investigated further which of the two terms for @xmath111 is dominant in pcs of the kondo lattice system .",
    "as seen in the above fit , there exists a large background term , @xmath102 , which might indicate that there exists substantial contribution from the channel into the conduction band without causing the interference .",
    "the fano line shape in our data persists over a wide temperature range including both normal and superconducting states , implying that the interference must be persistent over a wide temperature range .",
    "third , how can we combine a fano resonance with ar or tunneling in heavy - fermion superconductors ? as seen in figure  [ fig : pcs001 ] , the background conductance asymmetry affects the shape of the ar conductance .",
    "thus , a successful microscopic theory should also explain this connection .",
    "in regards to this issue , we note that flint _",
    "recently proposed a theory on the ar into a composite paired superconductor @xcite .",
    "they claimed that it is possible for electrons to cotunnel into the kondo lattice and this would provide an enhanced contribution to ar with a fano resonant structure .",
    "it is interesting to look into the similarities and differences between their fano resonant structure and the asymmetric conductance shape in our model .",
    "_ boundary conditions in the btk problem .",
    "_ although the theory by deutscher and nozires @xcite explains how ar is possible in heavy fermions , what role is played by the fermi velocity mismatch is not clear .",
    "related to this topic , arajo and sacramento @xcite reported recently that the argument by deutscher and nozires can be proved explicitly by solving this problem for a normal - metal / heavy - fermion - superconductor interface .",
    "quantitative measure of the fermi velocity mismatch effect in pcs might be achieved by measuring ar conductance from a ballistic junction involving a pair with well - matched fermi velocities , e.g. , au / nb , but without any oxide layer formed at the interface .    _ tunneling cone effect . _ in order to detect abs unambiguously , making measurements in the tunneling limit will provide more flexible diagnostics .",
    "thin film growth of cecoin@xmath0 has been attempted but the quality is not yet good enough for all - thin - film based tunnel junctions . as an alternative , it is worthwhile trying to deposit an artificial tunnel barrier onto single crystals .    _ ar in heavy - fermion - metal / conventional superconductor . _ despite some success reported in cecoin@xmath0/nb point contacts , the magnitude of ar signal in such junctions is not well determined due to the intervening oxide layer on the nb tip @xcite .",
    "further measurements on such junctions but without oxide interface layers will provide important clues to many issues on ar in heavy fermions .",
    "a related experiment will be exploring whether proximity effect exists in such junctions @xcite .",
    "the fact that ar is frequently observed in heavy fermions implies that proximity effect should exist because it is well known that ar is at the heart of this phenomenon @xcite .    _ fano effect in kondo lattice systems . _",

    "<S> we review the current status of andreev reflection spectroscopy on the heavy fermions , mostly focusing on the case of cecoin@xmath0 , a heavy - fermion superconductor with a critical temperature of 2.3 k. this is a well - established technique to investigate superconducting order parameters via measurements of the differential conductance from nanoscale metallic junctions . </S>",
    "<S> andreev reflection is clearly observed in cecoin@xmath0 as in other heavy - fermion superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> considering the large mismatch in fermi velocities , this observation seemingly appears to disagree with the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> the measured andreev signal is highly reduced to the order of maximum @xmath1 13% compared to the theoretically predicted value ( 100% ) . </S>",
    "<S> the background conductance exhibits a systematic evolution in its asymmetry over a wide temperature range from above the heavy fermion coherence temperature down to well below the superconducting transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the conductance spectra using the extended btk model provides a qualitative measure for the superconducting order parameter symmetry , which is determined to be @xmath2-wave in cecoin@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that existing models do not quantitatively account for the data , which we attribute to the intrinsic properties of the heavy fermions . a substantial body of experimental data and extensive theoretical analysis point to the existence of two fluid components in cecoin@xmath0 and other heavy - fermion compounds . </S>",
    "<S> a phenomenological model is proposed employing a fano interference effect between two conductance channels in order to explain both the conductance asymmetry and the reduced andreev signal . </S>",
    "<S> this model appears plausible not only because it provides good fits to the data but also because it is highly likely that the electrical conduction occurs via two channels , one into the heavy electron liquid and the other into the conduction electron continuum . </S>",
    "<S> further experimental and theoretical investigations will shed new light on the mechanism of how the coherent heavy - electron liquid emerges out of the kondo lattice , a prototypical strongly correlated electron system . </S>",
    "<S> unresolved issues and future directions are also discussed . </S>"
