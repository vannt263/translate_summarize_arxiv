    "quantum process tomography @xcite is _ the _ standard for the verification and characterization of quantum operations on well - controlled quantum systems . among others , recent experimental demonstrations of quantum simulators of multi - partite quantum systems",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that , by now , the number of well controllable qubits is in a regime for which conventional tomography techniques fail as the required experimental and numerical post - processing resources scale exponentially with the number of qubits .",
    "while there has been a considerable effort to introduce scalable techniques that allow for an efficient reconstruction @xcite and verification @xcite of quantum states , quantum process tomography still leaves much to be desired .",
    "$ ] ( with pairwise entanglement indicated by vertical lines ) , the channel @xmath0 is applied on the system , and products of pauli observables are measured on all blocks of @xmath1 consecutive sites ( exemplified for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , which serves as input to reconstruct the resulting state @xmath4 and thus the channel  @xmath0 . _ bottom row : _ equivalently , these expectation values may be obtained without the ancillary system .",
    "the initial states have eigenstates of pauli matrices ( here , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , so those of @xmath7 ) on those sites where a pauli matrix would have been measured on the ancilla .",
    "after application of the channel , the system part of the ancilla + system measurement is carried out ( here , that of @xmath8 ) . ]    the most straightforward approach to process tomography is based on the idea of probing the quantum channel with an informationally complete set of states . after sending each of these input states through the channel ,",
    "the process underlying the dynamics is characterized by performing full state tomography on all of the output states .",
    "the so - obtained map fully characterizes the channel @xcite .",
    "this strategy is referred to as _ standard quantum process tomography _ ( sqpt ) and works well as long as the underlying system is of low dimension .",
    "considering multi - partite quantum systems , however , reveals the disadvantages of this technique : not only the number of states to be sent through the channel and to be indentified grows exponentially with the number of subsystems @xmath9 , but also the number of parameters that need to be determined for each of the output states .",
    "there is , however , a strategy to overcome the exponential scaling of the number of input and output states : _ ancilla - assisted process tomography _ ( aapt ) @xcite .",
    "aapt requires an ancillary system of the same size @xmath9 as the system itself , the preparation of a maximally entangled input state @xmath10 on the combined system , and full tomography of the resulting state after application of the channel , @xmath11 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : measurement - scheme ] .",
    "this method is based on the correspondence between quantum states and quantum processes known as the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of an ancillary system considerably reduces the complexity of the preparation stage ( as opposed to exponentially many input states in sqpt , only one state has to be prepared and only one output state has to be characterized ) but comes at the cost of needing access to an independent ancilla system of the same size as the system that is to be analyzed .",
    "still , for a complete characterization of the output state @xmath4 , a number of measurements exponentially large in @xmath9 is required @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we combine recent results from efficient and scalable state tomography @xcite with the idea of aapt and discuss how to avoid the need for an ancilla system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : measurement - scheme ] .",
    "this allows us to formulate a scalable process tomography scheme where the number of input and output states , together with the experimental measurement settings to characterize the latter , grows only linearly with the number of qubits .",
    "we restrict our attention to unitary processes and demonstrate our scalable process tomography technique with numerical simulations of quantum circuits and of time evolution under local one - dimensional hamiltonians . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics - circuits ] , we consider a circuit which prepares a greenberg - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state and the quantum fourier transform .",
    "note that the ghz circuit is a limited - depth circuit ( as defined below , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which implies that it has an efficient matrix product operator ( mpo ) representation in the sense that the bond dimension scales at most polynomially with the number of qubits .",
    "this is exactly the class of processes for which one would expect methods based on refs .",
    "@xcite to work . in turn , the quantum fourier transform is a circuit of polynomial depth , but one that admits an approximate efficient simulation with a classical computer  @xcite . for the @xmath12 qubits considered here , an mpo representation that approximates the circuit exists and our reconstruction scheme works well .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : numerics - hamiltonians ] we simulate process tomography for time evolutions of one - dimensional local hamiltonians @xmath13 and show how to extract the hamiltonians from the reconstructed processes .",
    "the reconstruction of a hamiltonian on @xmath9 qubits will require one process reconstruction at time @xmath14 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics - hamiltonians - essentials ] ) or two process reconstructions at times @xmath15 , @xmath16 separated by no more than @xmath17 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics - hamiltonians - twotimes ] ) . in the latter case",
    ", the only restriction on @xmath15 and @xmath16 is that the process admits reconstruction at those times . in both cases ,",
    "the reconstruction of a hamiltonian will require roughly @xmath18 measurements of each of the @xmath19 observables .",
    "the quality of the reconstructed processes may be quantified using the same experimental resources that are also required to obtain the reconstruction : for unitary processes , @xmath4 is guaranteed to be pure such that certifiability of the reconstruction of @xmath0 is inherited by the certifiablity of @xmath4 @xcite ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for an analogous mixed - state certificate .",
    "let us first consider the aapt scheme and restrict , without loss of generality , to qubits .",

    "[ fig : measurement - scheme ] with odd sites representing the ancilla and even sites denoting the system itself . in this enumeration",

    "the system ( i.e. , the even sites ) is sent through the channel and state tomography has to be performed on the resulting state @xmath23 . without any prior knowledge about the underlying quantum channel , full state tomography is inevitable and one seemingly faces the notorious curse of dimensionality .",
    "a large class of quantum states , however , may be reconstructed from a number of measurements and with post - processing resources that both scale only polynomially in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "post - processing with polynomial resources requires an efficient representation of the state , which , in one dimension , is provided by matrix product state ( mps ) or operator ( mpo ) representations @xcite , compare also tree tensor networks @xcite and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz @xcite .",
    "there are many examples of physical states that admit an efficient matrix product representation , e.g. ground states of gapped local hamiltonians @xcite , thermal states of local hamiltonians @xcite and entangled states like the ghz state , the w state and cluster states .",
    "if the output state @xmath23 happens to be close to this class of states with an efficient matrix product representation , scalable reconstruction of the channel may be achieved .",
    "the input to the scalable state tomography schemes @xcite are given by the measurement data of the following observables ( or , alternatively , any other local operator basis ) : @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and a fixed @xmath1 independent of the size of the system . here ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the pauli matrices for qubit @xmath30 .",
    "there are @xmath31 such operators , i.e. , the number of observables that are required for these reconstruction schemes scales linearly in @xmath9 .",
    "note that the restriction to local information is not mandatory , any output state that is uniquely characterized by a number of measurements that scales moderately with @xmath9 can be reconstructed by these techniques @xcite and , hence , belongs to the class of states for which our process tomography procedure is applicable .",
    "interestingly , the necessary information may also be obtained without the need of an ancilla ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , yet then increasing the demand at the preparation stage : by virtue of the identity @xmath32=\\frac{\\text{tr}[\\mathcal e(\\hat{a}^t)\\hat{s}]}{2^{n } } , \\;\\;\\;\\hat{a}^t=\\sum_{i , j}\\langle j|\\hat{a}|i\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j|,\\ ] ] which holds for any operator @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) acting on the system ( ancilla ) , and the fact that each @xmath35 is of the form @xmath36 ( @xmath37 : ancilla , @xmath38 : system ) , one may obtain the necessary expectation values by preparing the eigenstates of the pauli matrices in @xmath39 on the system , sending them through the channel and measuring @xmath40 on the resulting state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : measurement - scheme ] and appendix[appendix : equivalence_details ] for details )  a scheme that requires no ancilla , the preparation of linearly many states and the measurement of linearly many observables .",
    "while the preparation and measurement strategy we just outlined may be favourable from an experimental perspective , we will present our scheme in the framework of aapt as certain intuitions are particularly transparent in this setting . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we discuss how unitary operators and the hamiltonians governing time evolution can be constructed from @xmath41 . in principle , the scheme is applicable to non - unitary channels as well , as long as the corresponding state @xmath42 permits reconstruction .",
    "we aim at reconstructing unitary channels , so channels of the form @xmath43 . for those",
    ", it is guaranteed that the resulting state is pure , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "the unitary may then be obtained from the identity @xmath45 . the output of the state reconstruction algorithms of refs .",
    "@xcite provide us with a pure estimate @xmath46 of @xmath4 given in the form of a matrix product state ( mps ) @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 and summation is over all @xmath50 ; @xmath51 .",

    "[ fig : measurement - scheme ] ) , the process @xmath57 having an efficient mpo representation will imply that the exact state @xmath58 has an efficient mps representation , and successful reconstruction may be possible .",
    "we now show that circuits with an at most logarithmic depth have an efficient mpo representation .",
    "our condition is equivalent to the condition given in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we give a tighter bound on the bond dimension .",
    "let a circuit @xmath57 be composed of @xmath59 two - qubit gates , @xmath60 we define the depth of the circuit at the bipartition @xmath61 by @xmath62 and denote the maximal depth by @xmath63 .",
    "this definition is motivated by the fact that an mpo representation of @xmath57 with bond dimension at most @xmath64 is easily obtained from the mpo representations of the @xmath65 : the @xmath65 have bond dimension @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 everywhere else , and the bond dimension of the product @xmath57 is given , in the worst case , by @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "if the depth @xmath70 grows at most logarithmically with  @xmath9 , we obtain an mpo representation of the circuit that is efficient in the sense that it has a number of parameters at most polynomial in @xmath9 .",
    "assume that the quantum process is in fact the time evolution under a local one - dimensional hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , where @xmath73 only acts on a fixed number of neighbouring sites ( we will consider nearest - neighbour hamiltonians throughout ) and where @xmath74 for a constant @xmath75 . with the tools to reconstruct unitary processes at hand , it remains to address the question of how to find a valid estimate of the hamiltonian @xmath76 governing the time evolution . to obtain @xmath76 from this unitary , we will use the identity @xmath77 together with the power series @xmath78 which converges for @xmath79 .",
    "the basic idea is that from @xmath80 , we know that @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and eq.([eq : trigon - sin - cos - arccos ] ) holds up to times limited by @xmath83 . while this appears to limit the accessible time interval for hamiltonian reconstruction , sec .",

    "this approach has two advantages over using a power series expansion of the logarithm : it is valid for larger values of @xmath87 and the series converges much faster .",
    "note that even if the reconstruction of @xmath88 is perfect , @xmath53 may differ from @xmath54 by a global phase @xmath89 , such that @xmath90 and eq .",
    "imposes @xmath91 . to remedy this problem",
    ", we use @xmath92 as our actual estimate .",
    "the initial state @xmath20 is an mps of low bond dimension and , as under local hamiltonians quantum correlations build up in a light - cone - like picture , @xmath93 will still have a small bond dimension for small times @xcite .",

    "we carry out numerical simulations as follows : for several exemplary channels @xmath0 , we numerically obtain @xmath58 as detailed below and simulate measurements of the local observables @xmath35 by drawing @xmath97 times per observable according to @xmath58 . in this way",
    ", we take statistical errors into account , with statistical errors for measurements without ancilla being very similar @xcite . the resulting empirical mean values ( i.e. , the simulated estimates of the weights @xmath98 of all eigenprojectors @xmath99 , @xmath100 , of @xmath101 )",

    "in other words , the operator norm distance defines a timescale on which two hamiltonians may be considered equivalent .    for all results below",
    ", we repeat the whole procedure of sampling from the simulated state , reconstructing it , and assessing the quality of the reconstruction several times .",
    "all results shown are mean values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 over a small number of runs , with deviations that are , for the number of measurements per observable considered , smaller than the size of the markers .",

    ".  [ fig : hamiltonian - reconstruction ] shows results for an isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian on @xmath95 qubits .",
    "we have also studied the critical ising model and a hamiltonian with random nearest - neighbour interaction , which show very similar behaviour and the corresponding results may be found in appendix  [ appendix : other hamiltonians ] .",
    "we use @xmath146 as a time unit and recall that the local terms of the hamiltonian are bounded by a constant , @xmath74 .",
    "this gives us @xmath147 and @xmath148 if we additionally assume that the local terms all have similar norm .",
    "the distance @xmath149 between the reconstructed and the exact hamiltonian shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hamiltonian - reconstruction ] displays the following features : first , the reconstruction is expected to fail for @xmath150 ( see eq .  ) and , indeed , @xmath149 is large in this area ( indicated by the grey background ) .",

    "[ fig : hamiltonian - reconstruction ] ) .",
    "thirdly , we observe that for infinitely many measurements per observable , @xmath153 , and fixed @xmath154 , the distance @xmath149 decreases with system size , a behaviour inherited from the quality of the reconstruction @xmath155 ( see left of fig .",
    "[ fig : hamiltonian - reconstruction ] ) : the fidelity @xmath112 is limited by the amount of block entanglement in @xmath88 . at a fixed time @xmath156 , an area law @xcite holds for this entanglement such that it is bounded even for arbitrarily large systems @xcite . for sufficiently large systems , we hence expect @xmath112 at fixed @xmath156 to be independent of the system size @xmath9 .",

    "[ fig : hamiltonian - reconstruction ] on the number @xmath97 of measurements per observable .",
    "first of all , with a finite number of measurements no reconstruction will be possible at small times , because the signal of the hamiltonian in @xmath159 will be smaller than the noise .",
    "furthermore , the data suggests that , for times before @xmath160 , @xmath161 this is the behaviour one would expect if one assumes that the relative error @xmath149 is proportional to the ratio @xmath162 of a noise amplitude @xmath163 and the strength of the signal @xmath164 , in which @xmath165 is motivated by the fact that we have measured @xmath166 observables , each of which has been estimated to within a standard deviation given , for sufficiently large @xmath97 , by @xmath167 .",
    "the explanation of the scaling properties together with the fact that all properties described are the same in the other hamiltonians investigated ( see appendix  [ appendix : other hamiltonians ] ) suggest that that the scaling laws apply for many local hamiltonians on a linear chain , for a large range of system sizes and any sufficiently large ( as indicated by the examples ) number of measurements .",
    "to summarize , measuring at larger times gives a larger signal and a smaller error , but we are limited by the condition @xmath168 imposed by eq .  .",
    "solving eq .",
    "for the number of measurements per observable , we obtain @xmath169 : a constant relative error @xmath170 at a fixed @xmath171 requires @xmath172 measurements per observable , resulting in a total number of measurements proportional to @xmath173 .          in its present formulation ,",
    "the reconstruction scheme is limited to @xmath174 , a restriction that may be overcome by measuring at two different times @xmath156 , @xmath175 : the times up to which the fidelity @xmath112 is sufficiently high is only limited by @xmath1 ",
    "increasing @xmath1 will increase the time up to which full information about @xmath54 may be obtained by measuring on @xmath1 consecutive qubits . in fact , as can be seen on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : hamiltonian - reconstruction ] , for @xmath176 and the relatively small @xmath2 , the fidelity @xmath112 is still quite high at @xmath177 while the reconstruction of @xmath76 fails for these times .",
    "measuring at @xmath156 , @xmath175 and obtaining @xmath178 , @xmath179 by reconstruction , we are only limited by @xmath180 when reconstructing @xmath76 from @xmath181 .",
    "[ fig : hamiltonian - reconstruction - twotimes ] shows results of this reconstruction scheme with @xmath182 and @xmath183 .    reconstructing the hamiltonian from @xmath184 , the time difference @xmath185 clearly assumes the role of the time @xmath156 when reconstructing the hamiltonian from @xmath57 at time @xmath156 alone .",

    "we simulated measurements on blocks of @xmath187 consecutive sites to satisfy this requirement .    for exact measurements , @xmath153 , the relative error @xmath188 does not approach zero for @xmath189 .",
    "the reason is that the error in @xmath190 remains non - zero as @xmath191 because @xmath192 has a fixed non - zero error at fixed @xmath156 .",
    "this non - zero error may also become larger than the signal amplitude @xmath193 , explaining the increasing error as @xmath189 for some of the hamiltonians .",
    "note that , from @xmath194 , we can also reconstruct hamiltonians that are time - dependent for times before @xmath156 and nearly constant between @xmath156 and @xmath195 . in this way , stroboscopic reconstructions of a time - dependent hamiltonian may be obtained after large propagation times .",
    "furthermore , @xmath196 becomes more restrictive as @xmath9 increases , thus the usefulness of taking measurements at two times increases for larger systems .      of course , making use of additional information can only improve the scheme . as an example , suppose that we know that the hamiltonian is nearest - neighbour only .",
    "one may then project the reconstructed @xmath197 onto a nearest - neighbour hamiltonian .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hamiltonian - reconstruction - twotimes ] , this reduces the error dramatically .",

    "we have discussed and numerically demonstrated how the restriction of these small evolution times may be relaxed by taking measurements at two different times .",
    "this enables the reconstruction and verification of a quantum device at arbitrarily large times for as long as the conditions for efficient state tomography are met , even if , intermittently , the device has passed through highly entangled states .",

    "<S> based on recently introduced efficient quantum state tomography schemes , we propose a scalable method for the tomography of unitary processes and the reconstruction of one - dimensional local hamiltonians . as opposed to the exponential scaling with the number of subsystems of standard quantum process tomography , the method relies only on measurements of linearly many local observables and either ( a ) the ability to prepare eigenstates of locally informationally complete operators or ( b ) access to an ancilla of the same size as the to - be - characterized system and the ability to prepare a maximally entangled state on the combined system . as such , the method requires at most linearly many states to be prepared and linearly many observables to be measured . </S>",
