    "transport properties of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have been a subject of extensive studies for a few years .",
    "@xcite in particular , very recently there has been a growing interest in the shot noise measurements of cnts .",
    "@xcite the shot noise provides useful information , not necessarily contained in the current , about the electronic structure , couplings to external leads , and indicates the role of correlations and different types of processes driving the current .",
    "@xcite in addition , recent experiments on cnts coupled to ferromagnetic leads have also shown that nanotubes exhibit a considerable tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect .",
    "@xcite the tmr provides information about the spin accumulation on the nanotube and charge states taking part in transport .",
    "@xcite    if the nanotube is weakly coupled to external leads , the current flows through the system due to consecutive tunneling processes .",
    "the first - order ( sequential ) tunneling processes dominate above a certain threshold voltage and are suppressed below this voltage due to the single - electron charging energy and/or finite level separation . on the other hand , current in the blockade regions",
    "is mainly mediated by second - order processes ( cotunneling ) .",
    "@xcite theoretical considerations of spin - dependent transport properties of single - wall metallic cnts in the perturbative regime have been so far mainly restricted to the sequential tunneling processes .",
    "@xcite however , because transport in the coulomb blockade regime is dominated by cotunneling processes , the sequential tunneling approximation may lead to wrong results .",
    "therefore , to get reliable information on the transport properties in the full range of bias and gate voltages , which could be compared with that observed experimentally , one should go beyond the first - order theory .",
    "this is the main objective of the present paper .",
    "the considerations are based on the real - time diagrammatic technique , which allows us to take into account the sequential tunneling , cotunneling and cotunneling - assisted sequential tunneling processes in a fully systematic way .",
    "assuming realistic parameters of the system , @xcite we calculate the current , differential conductance , tmr , and the shot noise of cnts .",
    "in addition , we also analyze the effect of different shell filling sequences , which can be realized in the single - wall cnts exhibiting four - electron periodicity , @xcite on transport characteristics . generally , one can distinguish two different shell filling schemes  in the first scheme the following sequence of the ground states is realized : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the spin of the nanotube , while in the second scheme it is : @xmath2 .",
    "we show that the effect of different shell filling scenarios is the most visible in the tmr , while the current and shot noise are only slightly affected .",
    "this is due to the fact that the tmr directly reflects the magnetic properties of the system and it is thus very sensitive to whether the ground state of the nanotube is a singlet or a triplet . as concerns the shot noise , we show that the corresponding fano factor @xmath3 in the coulomb blockade regions is enhanced above the schottky value , @xmath4 , due to bunching of inelastic cotunneling processes .",
    "however , this enhancement is significantly lower than that obtained within the first - order approximation .",
    "@xcite contrary , in the transport regions where the sequential contribution to the current is dominant , the shot noise is sub - poissonian with @xmath3 slightly above 1/2 and is only weakly modified by the cotunneling processes .",
    "our results for the shot noise are in qualitative agreement with recent experimental data on carbon nanotubes , @xcite and quantum dots .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the model of the nanotube and in section 3 we briefly present the real - time diagrammatic technique used in calculations . numerical results and their discussion",
    "is given in section 4 , where we first present the results on cnts coupled to nonmagnetic leads and then we discuss the effects of spin - dependent tunneling on transport properties .",
    "in addition , we also present results for two different shell filling scenarios . finally , we give the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we consider a single wall metallic cnt weakly coupled to the two electrodes which can be either nonmagnetic or ferromagnetic . in the latter case",
    "the magnetizations of the leads are assumed to be collinear and form either parallel or antiparallel magnetic configuration .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath5 of the system takes the general form @xmath6 .",
    "the first two terms describe noninteracting itinerant electrons in the leads , @xmath7 for the left ( @xmath8 ) and right ( @xmath9 ) lead , with @xmath10 being the energy of an electron with the wave vector @xmath11 and spin @xmath12 in the lead @xmath13 .",
    "the third term of @xmath5 describes the single - wall cnt and is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the occupation operator for spin @xmath12 and @xmath17th level in the subband @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the energy @xmath20 of the @xmath17th discrete level in the subband @xmath18 is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mean level spacing and @xmath23 is the energy mismatch between the two subbands of the nanotube .",
    "the charging energy of cnt is described by @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the charge on the nanotube induced by gate voltages .",
    "the additional on - level coulomb energy between two electrons occupying the same orbital level is denoted by @xmath26 , whereas @xmath27 describes the exchange energy between the spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "the exchange effects described by @xmath27 play an important role for small diameter nanotubes @xcite ( up to 2 nm or so ) , as considered in this paper , whereas for nanotubes of larger diameters these effects become negligible .",
    "finally , the last term of @xmath5 , @xmath28 , takes into account tunneling processes between the nanotube and electrodes , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the tunnel matrix elements between the lead @xmath13 and the @xmath17th level ( assumed to be spin - independent also for ferromagnetic leads ) .",
    "coupling of the @xmath17th level to external leads is described by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the density of states in the lead @xmath13 for spin @xmath12 .",
    "the role of ferromagnetic leads is taken into account just _ via _ the spin - dependent density of states @xmath32 .",
    "the coupling parameters can also be expressed as @xmath33 , for the spin - majority ( spin - minority ) electron bands , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 being the spin polarization of the lead @xmath13 , @xmath36 . for nonmagnetic leads , @xmath37 .",
    "in the following we assume @xmath38 for all values of @xmath17 and @xmath13 .",
    "in order to calculate the transport through a single - wall metallic carbon nanotube in the sequential and cotunneling regimes , we employ the real - time diagrammatic technique .",
    "@xcite it consists in a systematic expansion of the nanotube ( reduced ) density matrix and the operators of interest with respect to the coupling strength @xmath39 .",
    "the time evolution of the reduced density matrix can be visualized as a sequence of irreducible self - energy blocks , @xmath40 , on the keldysh contour .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath41 of @xmath40 describe transitions between the many - body states @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the cnt .",
    "@xcite then , the dyson equation constitutes the full propagation of the reduced density matrix , which leads to a kinetic equation for the nanotube occupation probabilities , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the vector containing probabilities and the matrix @xmath46 is given by @xmath40 with one arbitrary row @xmath47 replaced by @xmath48 due to the normalization condition @xmath49 . the current flowing through the system can be found from @xmath50 , whereas the zero - frequency current noise , @xmath51 , is given by @xcite @xmath52 \\mathbf{p}^{\\rm st}\\right\\}$ ] .",
    "the matrix @xmath53 is the self - energy matrix with one _ internal _ vertex ( two internal vertices ) , resulting from the expansion of the tunneling hamiltonian , replaced by the current operator , while the matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are partial derivatives of @xmath40 and @xmath56 with respect to the convergence factor of the laplace transform .",
    "@xcite the object @xmath57 is calculated from : @xmath58 , with @xmath59 being the unit vector with row @xmath47 set to zero , and @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite in order to calculate the transport properties order by order in tunneling processes , we expand the self - energy matrices , @xmath61 , the dot occupations , @xmath62 , and , @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the self - energies can be calculated using the corresponding diagrammatic rules .",
    "the shell filling structure of single - wall carbon nanotubes exhibits the four - electron periodicity , which is a consequence of the two spin - degenerate subbands of the nanotube .",
    "furthermore , depending on the intrinsic parameters of the nanotube , its shell filling can generally have two different scenarios .",
    "@xcite the first one is associated with the following sequence of the ground states : @xmath0 , which is realized when @xmath64 . on the other hand , in the second scenario the spin state of the nanotube changes as @xmath2 , which happens for @xmath65 .",
    "the difference between these two cases appears in the transport regime where the nanotube is doubly occupied . in the case of first sequence ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath64 , one orbital level of one of the subbands is fully occupied and the nearest orbital level of the other subband is empty - this is a singlet state .",
    "whereas for @xmath65 , there is a single electron on each level of the two subbands which , due to the exchange interaction @xmath27 , lead to the formation of a triplet state . in the following ,",
    "we analyze the behavior of the tunnel magnetoresistance and the shot noise in the linear and nonlinear response regimes depending on two different shell filling schemes .",
    "( color online ) differential conductance ( a ) and fano factor ( b ) as a function of bias and gate voltages .",
    "the parameters are : @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 mev . ]    when @xmath64 , the shell filling of the nanotube is realized in this way that the next orbital levels are being occupied only after the lower lying levels are full , which leads to the sequence of doublet and singlet ground states , @xmath0 . to model the nanotube in this transport regime , we have taken the experimental parameters derived by w. liang _",
    "@xcite furthermore , to clearly elucidate the effect of cotunneling on transport properties , we first present and discuss the behavior of the differential conductance and the fano factor in the case of cnt coupled to nonmagnetic leads . in this case , for comparison we also show the results obtained when taking into account only the first - order tunneling .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the density plots of the differential conductance ( a ) and the fano factor ( b ) as a function of the bias and gate voltages . since the noise in the small bias regime ( @xmath76 ) , is dominated by thermal nquist - johnson noise , we excluded this part from considerations and marked it by the black thick line around @xmath77 ( the corresponding fano factor diverges as @xmath78 ) . the black diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) correspond to blockade regions , where sequential transport is exponentially suppressed and current is dominated by the second order processes .",
    "furthermore , the four - electron periodicity is clearly visible in the linear conductance , while the additional lines in the differential conductance for voltages larger then the threshold for sequential tunneling are due to excited states participating in transport .",

    "[ fig:1 ] . additionally , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we also show the corresponding quantities calculated in the first order ( dashed lines ) .",
    "it is evident that the cotunneling processes modify the current mainly in the blockade regime and also close to resonance ( blockade threshold ) , leading to renormalization of the nanotube levels .",
    "this makes the conductance peak shifted towards smaller voltages .",
    "as regards the shot noise , cotunneling processes have a significant impact on the fano factor , particularly in the blockade regions corresponding to even occupations , where the shot noise is super - poissonian .",
    "the corresponding fano factor is then larger than unity , but significantly reduced in comparison to that calculated in the first order approximation .",
    "consider first the limit of sequential ( first order ) tunneling processes .",
    "the sequential tunneling starts when the bias approaches the threshold voltage .",
    "owing to the fermi distribution , sequential processes start before the zero - temperature threshold is reached .",
    "when the highest populated level is doubly occupied , tunneling from the source to the drain electrode may leave the nanotube either in the initial or in an excited state .",
    "when the cnt is left in the initial state , the next tunneling process goes with the same probability as the first one .",
    "when , however , the cnt is left in an excited state , the thermal ( dynamical ) blockade is lifted and the subsequent tunneling processes are faster .",
    "this leads to bunching of fast tunneling processes , which leads to the super - poissonian noise . @xcite",
    "the cotunneling processes , both single - barrier and two - barrier ones , are not blocked .",
    "generally , there are elastic and inelastic ones , which occur with different probabilities .",
    "however , the asymmetry between the fast and slow ones is reduced in comparison with the first order , which leads to a smaller fano factor when the second order processes are included . apart from this",
    ", the inelastic cotunneling processes also lift the dynamical blockade of the sequential processes .",
    "( color online ) tunnel magnetoresistance ( a ) and fano factor in the parallel ( b ) and antiparallel ( c ) configuration as a function of bias and gate voltages .",
    "the parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] with @xmath81 . ]",
    "it is easy to note , that the above scenario does not hold when the highest level is singly occupied .",
    "in such a case first order tunneling processes are of comparable velocity and therefore the fano factor is only slightly above unity .",
    "this applies also to cotunneling processes .",
    "thus , depending on the ground state of the nanotube which can be changed by the gate voltage , we either find a considerable enhancement of the fano factor ( super - poissonian shot noise ) or the fano factor is approximately equal unity ( poissonian shot noise ) .",
    "this observation is in agreement with recent experiments carried out by e. onac _ et al . _",
    "@xcite finally , it is noteworthy that outside the blockade regions the shot noise becomes sub - poissonian and the corrections due to cotunneling processes are much smaller than in the blockade regime , although still noticeable .",

    "the general features of the fano factors are similar to those in the limit of nonmagnetic leads , except for the fact that now there is an additional contribution to the shot noise coming from the difference between the two spin channels for transport .",
    "because the resultant coupling of the nanotube to ferromagnetic leads in the parallel configuration is larger than in the antiparallel one , the fluctuations of the current are enhanced in the parallel configuration as compared to the antiparallel one .",

    "all the quantities are calculated taking into account both the sequential and cotunneling processes , and we do not distinguish between the first and second order contributions . as in the case of nonmagnetic leads , the second order processes significantly modify the tmr and fano factor in the blockade regions , and only slightly outside these regions .",
    "an interesting feature is a drop of the tmr at the onset for sequential tunneling , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) and ( g ) , which is present when the ground state of the nanotube is a singlet .",
    "this is due to the interplay of the inelastic cotunneling processes which flip the spin of electrons occupying the nanotube and the sequential tunneling which is generally incoherent . on the other hand ,",
    "when the ground state of the nanotube is a doublet , the tmr does not drop with approaching the threshold , see fig .  [",
    "fig:3](a ) , which is due to a nonequilibrium spin accumulation induced in the nanotube .",

    "this is associated with the nonequilibrium spin accumulation in triplet states , which tends to enhance the difference between the two magnetic configurations of the system .",
    "furthermore , it is also due to a finite exchange interaction @xmath27 , because of which only particular components of triplet take part in transport .",
    "in this way , the exchange interaction plays a role similar to an external magnetic field .",
    "as already shown in the case of quantum dots , the tmr may be enhanced above the julliere s value when only particular spin states of the dot participate in transport .",
