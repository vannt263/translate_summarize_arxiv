    "ferromagnetic nanowires possess interesting properties that might be exploited in spintronic devices and more specifically in non - volatile memory ( mram ) and magnetic logic devices  @xcite .",
    "the mermin - wagner  @xcite theorem forbids ( heisenberg - type ) magnetism in systems of dimension ( @xmath1 ) with short - range interactions .",
    "hence , ferromagnetic nanowires being a quasi - one dimensional system displaying magnetic properties represent an interesting system from the fundamental point of view .",
    "in addition to their interest in fundamental magnetism , they have many applications in microwave devices such as circulators , superconducting single - photon ghz detectors and counters  @xcite , mass information storage ( perpendicular recording ) as read - write recording heads , magneto - electronics ( wire bending angle dependent gmr ) as well as in quantum computing and telecommunication .",
    "they are simpler than nanotubes since their physical properties do not depend on chirality and they can be grown with a variety of methods : molecular beam epitaxy , electrochemical methods ( template synthesis , anodic alumina filters ) , chemical solution techniques ( self - assembly , sol - gel , emulsions ... ) etc ...    ordered nanowire arrays may be of paramount importance in areas such as extremely high - density information recording of patterned media such as the quantum magnetic disk  @xcite and in novel high - frequency communication or signal - processing devices based on the exploitation of spin - waves ( magnonic devices )  @xcite to transfer and process information of spin - currents with no disspative joule effect .    in this work ,",
    "fmr measurements are performed to detect the uniform resonance mode and extract the effective anisotropy field @xmath2 versus angle from arrays of ni nanowires with diameters ranging from 15 nm to 100 nm using conventional angular - dependent ferromagnetic resonance fmr in the x - band ( 9.4 ghz ) as a function of temperature ranging from liquid helium ( 4.2 k ) to room temperature .",
    "we find that magneto - elastic effects play an important role in those systems that might be exploited in novel storage concepts .",
    "this work is organised as follows : in section 2 , fmr measurements are presented and later analysed in section 3 .",
    "we conclude the work in section 4 and appendix a details the fmr angular fitting procedure while appendix b covers dipolar effects .",
    "individual ni wires inside the array are aligned parallel to each other within a deviation of a few degrees .",
    "they have a length of 6 @xmath3 m and are characterized by a cylindrical shape with a typical variation in diameter of less than 5% and with a low - surface roughness .    ,",
    "applied field @xmath4 and corresponding angles @xmath5 they make with the nanowire axis that can be considered as an ellipsoid - shaped single domain with characteristic lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "when the aspect ratio @xmath8 is large enough the ellipsoid becomes an infinite cylinder.,width=240 ]    previous experiments on magnetization reversal mechanisms in ni arrays using alternating gradient - force magnetometry and superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometry reveal that at room temperature the magnetic anisotropy is dominated by the shape anisotropy .",
    "fmr experiments are performed with the microwave pumping field @xmath9 has a frequency of 9.4 ghz with a dc bias field @xmath10 oriented arbitrarily making an angle @xmath11 with the nanowire axis .    despite the fact",
    "several studies have considered reversal modes by domain nucleation and propagation ( see for instance henry _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for an extensive discussion of the statistical determination of reversal processes and distribution functions of domain nucleation and propagation fields ; see also ferr _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and hertel  @xcite who showed the existence of domains with micromagnetic simulations ) , we do not consider domain nucleation and propagation in this work and rather concentrate on the single domain case that might be expected due to the smallness of ni magnetocristalline with respect to shape anisotropy .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath0 in the uniform mode is obtained by considering an ellipsoid with an effective uniaxial anisotropy , despite the fact ni has cubic anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "this description is sufficient to describe the fmr spectra we find ( see de la torre medina _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a description fully based on a cubic anisotropy approach ) .",

[ fit ] ) .    from this angular variation , we infer that 15 nm samples behave differently from larger diameter samples with a transition observed about 50 nm in agreement with the hysteresis loop vsm measurements ( as displayed in fig .",

    "@xcite estimate is recovered . nevertheless in our case ,",

    "the agreement as a function of temperature for both nanowire diameters and both orientations ( @xmath31@xmath32and @xmath33@xmath32 ) of the field is a strong indication of the presence of magneto - elastic effects .",
    "we have performed angular and temperature dependent fmr on ni nanowire arrays with variable diameter and shown with fmr that the easy axis orientation for the 15 nm diameter sample is perpendicular to the wire axis in sharp contrast with the 50 nm , 80 nm and 100 nm samples .",
    "note that we expect ( from bulk ni ) the easy axis along the wire axis by comparing the value of shape energy with respect to anisotropy energy .",
    "results obtained from the angular behavior of @xmath0 versus @xmath46 show that @xmath0 is minimum at 90@xmath32for the 15 nm sample whereas it is minimum at 0@xmath32for the larger diameter samples agree with hysteresis loops obtained from vsm measurements and confirm presence of the transition of easy axis direction from perpendicular at 15 nm to parallel to nanowire axis at 50 nm diameter .",
    "the transition observed at 50 nm is interesting because of several potential applications in race - track mram devices .",

    "@xcite predicted that in permalloy nanowires of 50 nm and less , moving zero - mass domain walls may attain a velocity of several 100 m / s beating walker limit obeyed in permalloy strips with same lateral size .",
    "hence , nanowire cylindrical geometry in contrast to prismatic geometry of stripes bears important consequences on current injection in nanowires and its effects on domain wall motion with reduced ohmic losses  @xcite .    at low temperature ,",
    "we find that @xmath2 increases when temperature is decreased .",
    "this may be attributed to the increase of @xmath47 , as temperature is decreased , affecting all anisotropy fields ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) that depend on @xmath47 .    separating the various contributions to anisotropy by using thermal , frequency , diameter and angular variations",
    "we have been able to pinpoint the main contribution to anisotropy at low temperature as stemming from magneto - elastic effects between the nanowire array and the dm supporting it .",
    "magneto - elastic effects affect directly the thermal variation of @xmath2 that increase at low temperature due to the increasing difference between the thermal expansion of the metallic nanowire and the dm .",
    "thermal effects must be analyzed properly for building extremely high density storage devices .",
    "ordered arrays of nanowires are good candidates for patterned media and may also be used in plasmonic applications such as nanoantenna arrays or nanophotonic waveguides in integrated optics  @xcite .",
    "recently , heat assisted magnetic perpendicular recording using plasmonic aperture or nano - antenna has been tested on patterned media in order to process large storage densities starting at 1 tbits / in@xmath51 and scalable up to 100 tbits / in@xmath51 .    in thermally - assisted perpendicular magnetic recording",
    ", a waveguide delivers light to a plasmonic nanoantenna placed just above the disk platter surface creating an intense optical pattern in the near - field region .",
    "however , this heats the disk on the nanometer scale ( around 25 nm ) and consequently temperature dependent magneto - elastic effects analysed in this work might affect the physics of high - density information writing in these systems .",
