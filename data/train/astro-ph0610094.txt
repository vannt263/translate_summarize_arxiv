    "to interpret existing and future observations of the high redshift universe , we need to understand the morphology of the hii regions during reionization . observations of high redshift quasars , gamma ray bursts , and ly@xmath6 emitters are currently probing redshifts at which the universe may have been significantly neutral @xcite .",
    "patchy reionization will leave its signature in the spectra of quasars and gamma ray bursts @xcite and in the correlation and luminosity functions of ly@xmath6 emitters @xcite . starting in 2007 , the atacama cosmology telescope and",
    "the south pole telescope will dissect the high-@xmath7 cmb anisotropies .",
    "the size distribution of hii regions during reionization affects the spectrum of these anisotropies @xcite .",
    "finally , 21 cm maps of the reionizing universe may soon be available .",
    "the gmrt , lofar , and mwa arrays will begin observing high redshift 21 cm emission within the next few years .",
    "the 21 cm signal will be an excellent probe of the structure of reionization @xcite .    a proper interpretation of these observations requires an understanding of how properties of the ionizing sources , how gas clumping , and how source suppression from thermal feedback impact the size distribution of hii regions .",
    "it is computationally demanding to simulate reionization in large enough volumes to capture the large - scale bubble morphology , and many previous numerical studies simulated only a limited number of reionization scenarios , making it difficult to isolate the impact of each of the numerous uncertain parameters .",
    "we do not know which objects reionized the universe , although it is most likely that stellar sources produced the bulk of the ionizing photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this case , it is unclear whether the ionizing photons were produced by the more numerous galaxies with halo masses @xmath8 or mainly by rarer , more massive galaxies .",
    "locally , the rate at which dwarf galaxies convert gas into stars scales as galaxy mass to the two - thirds power @xcite .",
    "if the same is true in the high redshift universe , then the more massive galaxies could dominate the production of ionizing photons .",
    "however , it might be easier for ionizing photons to escape into the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) from smaller galaxies @xcite .",
    "analytic models predict larger hii regions in scenarios in which the most massive galaxies produce more of the ionizing photons @xcite . in spite of our ignorance regarding",
    "which sources reionized the universe , numerical studies have yet to examine how reionization depends on the properties of ionizing sources .",
    "further , we have little observational handle on the amount of small - scale structure , or ` gas clumping ' , in the high redshift igm , and researchers have not reached a consensus regarding its impact on the morphology of reionization .",
    "many previous large - scale reionization simulations have either entirely ignored structure on scales smaller than the simulation grid cell or , despite inadequate resolution , have incorporated it via a subgrid clumping factor calculated from their large volume simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been some effort to calibrate subgrid clumping factors from an ensemble of small - box simulations @xcite .",
    "however , even these efforts are very simplified .",
    "no study has tried to isolate the effect that gas clumping has on the size distribution and morphology of hii regions .",
    "if the morphology is very sensitive to this clumping , it would be hard to trust the results from simulations .",
    "another relevant piece of physics is thermal feedback from photo - heating the igm , which can suppress star formation and potentially alter the morphology of reionization .",
    "however , the extent to which the structure of reionization is affected by such feedback has yet to be adequately addressed .",
    "@xcite , utilizing an analytic model for reionization that includes feedback ( albeit , on halos that cool via molecular line emission ) , found that it can have a dramatic impact on bubble sizes , in some cases creating a bimodal bubble size distribution .",
    "similar claims may also hold for thermal feedback on galaxies that cool via atomic transitions  the more likely culprit to ionize the universe . @xcite",
    "found using radiative transfer simulations that thermal feedback plays a key role during reionization , marginalizing the contribution from halos with masses below @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the presence of minihalos and the rate at which the gas from these halos is photo - evaporated may shape reionization .",
    "@xcite show that a significant fraction of the ionizing photons will be consumed by minihalos and claim that the effect of minihalos on the morphology of reionization is similar to changing the efficiency of the sources . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "argue analytically that minihalos can create a well defined peak in the bubble size distribution that is set by the mean free path for an ionizing photon to be absorbed by a minihalo .",
    "the effect of minihalos on the characteristics of the hii bubbles has not been investigated in simulations .    in this paper , we present a suite of parameterized models , using large volume radiative transfer simulations , to understand the impact of each of these uncertain quantities on the morphology of reionization . realistic simulations of reionization require extremely large volumes with high mass resolution .",
    "previous estimates suggest that , in order to capture a representative sample of the universe during reionization , one needs a simulation box with a side length of approximately @xmath10 comoving @xcite . to resolve halos at the atomic hydrogen cooling mass ( @xmath11 at @xmath12 ) in a simulation of this volume",
    ", one needs about @xmath13 billion particles ",
    "larger than any n - body simulation to date . in order to get around this computational difficulty ,",
    "we employ a hybrid scheme that combines a @xmath0 particle , @xmath14 n - body simulation with a press - schechter merger history tree .",
    "the merger tree allows us to incorporate halos that are unresolved in our n - body simulation .",
    "additional effects such as thermal feedback and minihalo evaporation are incorporated in our simulations with analytic prescriptions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ simulations ]",
    "we outline the n - body and radiative transfer codes used in this study .",
    "the radiative transfer code is discussed in more detail in  [ code ] .",
    "[ mergertree ] describes our method for including unresolved low - mass halos . in  [ sources ] we investigate the effect of different source prescriptions on reionization , and in  [ feedback ] we discuss the effect of source suppression owing to photo - heating .",
    "section  [ recombinations ] considers the role of quasi - linear gas clumping and minihalos in shaping the morphology of reionization .",
    "section  [ redshift ] discusses the dependence of the morphology on the redshift of reionization .",
    "the relevance of the previous results to observations of ly@xmath6 emitters and of high redshift 21 cm emission are discussed in  [ observations ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we use a @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "all distances in this paper are in comoving units .",
    "more recent measurements suggest that @xmath22 may , in fact , be lower than the value assumed in this work @xcite .",
    "the best fit wmap value is @xmath23 and when combined with other cmb experiments , the 2df galaxy survey and the ly@xmath6 forest becomes @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "a lower @xmath22 reduces the number of ionizing sources during reionization .",
    "however , according to analytic models for the halo distribution , the sources in a @xmath25 universe are equivalent to those in a @xmath26 universe at a slightly earlier time .",
    "specifically , structure formation in a @xmath25 universe at redshift @xmath27 should be identical to that in a @xmath26 universe at @xmath28 .",
    "this occurs because halo abundances depend on @xmath22 through the combination @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the high redshift growth factor .",
    "analytic models for reionization based on the excursion set formalism also depend on @xmath22 only through the same combination @xmath29 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath22 is lower , this is equivalent to a simple re - mapping of redshifts .",
    "furthermore , in  [ redshift ] we demonstrate that the bubble structure ( at fixed ionized fraction ) is relatively independent of redshift and hence @xmath22 .",
    "this paper focuses on predicting the large - scale morphology of reionization , rather than precisely _ when _ reionization happens .",
    "furthermore , we do not focus on understanding the morphology at times when the global ionized fraction is near zero or near unity  in both limits , detailed modeling of the complex radiative , thermal and chemical feedback processes is essential and challenging . instead , we focus on intermediate ionization fractions . in addition , we do not discuss the evolution of the ionizing background or the part in @xmath31 neutral fraction within the bubbles .",
    "we leave such discussion to future work .",
    "we run a @xmath0 n - body simulation in a box of size @xmath32 with the treepm code l - gadget2 @xcite to model the density field .",
    "outputs are stored on @xmath33 million year intervals between the redshifts of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . a friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length of @xmath36 times",
    "the mean inter - particle spacing is used to identify virialized halos .",
    "the simulated halo mass function matches the @xcite mass function for groups with at least 64 particles @xcite .",
    "however , the measured abundance of @xmath37 particle halos is below the true value , but at an acceptable level .",
    "thirty - two particle groups correspond to a halo mass of @xmath38 .",
    "ideally , we would like to resolve halos down to the atomic hydrogen cooling mass , @xmath39 , which corresponds to the minimum mass galaxy that can form stars .",
    "we add unresolved halos into the radiative transfer simulation using the prescription described in  [ mergertree ] .",
    "to generate the density grids , we use nearest grid point gridding of the n - body particles . nearest grid point is problematic if poisson fluctuations in the number of particles are important at the cell scale .",
    "however , a typical cell in our fiducial runs has @xmath40 dark matter particles , such that poisson fluctuations are much smaller than the order - unity cosmological ones at the cell scale .",
    "nearest grid point affords us a higher level of gas clumping ( and a more accurate level of recombinations ) than other gridding procedures , which smooth the n - body density field more severely .",
    "we use an improved version of the @xcite radiative transfer code , which is discussed in detail in  [ code ] .",
    "this code is optimized to simulate reionization , making several justified simplifications to drastically speed up the computation compared to other reionization codes .",
    "the code inputs the particle locations from the n - body simulation as well as a list of the ionizing sources , and it casts rays from each source to compute the ionization field .",
    "we assume that the sources have a soft uv spectrum that scales as @xmath41 ( consistent with a popii initial mass function ( imf ) ) .",
    "the parameters we choose for the source luminosities , subgrid clumping , and feedback are varied throughout this paper and are discussed in subsequent sections .",
    "the radiative transfer code assumes perfectly sharp hii fronts , tracking the front position at subgrid scales . ) .",
    "] this is an excellent approximation for sources with a soft spectrum , in which the mean free path for ionizing photons is kiloparsecs , substantially smaller than the cell size in our radiative transfer simulations .",
    "the radiative transfer simulations in this paper typically take two days on a @xmath42 ghz amd opteron processor to reach an ionized fraction of @xmath43 .",
    "we do not discuss ionization fractions larger than @xmath43 in this work because our simulation box becomes too small to provide a representative picture at larger @xmath2 . in some models for reionization ,",
    "our box is too small even at smaller @xmath2 than @xmath44 to adequately sample the bubble scale and generate clean power spectra .",
    "we typically choose source parameters so that reionization ends near @xmath45 .",
    "while overlap  the final stage of reionization in which the bubbles merge and fill all space  may have occurred at higher redshifts , upcoming observations of 21 cm emission , qsos , and ly@xmath6 emitters are most sensitive to low redshifts reionization scenarios .",
    "the most recent wmap @xmath46 is consistent at the 1@xmath47 level with all the ionization histories in this paper @xcite .",
    "other papers have attempted to match the source properties to observations at lower redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the escaping uv luminosity of observed galaxies is very uncertain , and current observations do not resolve low luminosity galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "significant extrapolation is hence required to connect the properties of observed galaxies at lower redshifts to the properties of the galaxies that reionize the universe .",
    "we expect that the source prescriptions adopted in this paper are consistent with all current observational constraints .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists the parameters for the reionization simulations discussed in this paper .",
    "a typical luminosity for a halo of mass @xmath48 in the simulations is @xmath49 ionizing photons @xmath50 . a salpeter imf yields approximately @xmath51 ionizing photons @xmath50 yr @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "for an escape fraction of @xmath53 , for a salpeter imf , and for a typical @xmath54 in our simulations , the star formation rate in a halo is @xmath55 .",
    "our n - body simulation does not resolve halos with masses less than @xmath56 .",
    "we use an analytic prescription to include smaller mass halos that are sufficiently massive for gas to cool by atomic processes and form stars .",
    "it is unrealistic to ignore the effect of the halos with @xmath57 , as many previous studies have done , since these halos contain more than half of the mass in cooled gas at all relevant redshifts ( modulo feedback from photo - heating ) .",
    "in addition , halos smaller than the cooling mass can still affect the clumpiness of the igm and , thus , are important to incorporate in our simulations .",
    "we outline two methods for adding unresolved halos to our simulation in this section and discuss the merits of each method .",
    "_ method 1 _ : we add unresolved halos into each cell on the simulation mesh according to the mean abundance predicted by press - schechter theory . in this text , we use this method to include the minihalos . in a cell of mass @xmath58 and linear overdensity today",

    "halos cluster differently in eulerian space , and , to account for this , we relate the linear overdensity @xmath67 to the eulerian space overdensity @xmath68 with the fitting formula calibrated from spherical collapse @xcite : @xmath69 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\frac{\\delta_c(z)}{1.68647}. \\label{eqn : lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the radiative transfer code inputs the eulerian overdensity @xmath70 for all cells from the n - body simulation . to get the linear theory overdensity",
    "@xmath71 we use equation ( [ eqn : lag ] ) and @xmath70 . in each cell of mass @xmath58 and linear overdensity @xmath71 , we place the average number of halos expected from press - schechter theory using equation ( [ eq : psmf ] ) . when including the lower mass halos with this method , we need to choose a coarse cell that contains more mass than the mass of our largest unresolved halo or @xmath56 . we also need a scheme to distribute the halos among the cells on the finer grid on which we perform the radiative transfer .",
    "we discuss this scheme in  [ minihalos ] .",
    "the disadvantage of method 1 is that it involves putting the average of the expected number of halos in each coarse cell and , hence , ignores poisson fluctuations in the halo abundance .",
    "even the smallest galaxies at these high redshifts are rare and so poisson fluctuations in their abundance can be important .",
    "_ method 2 _ : we account for poisson fluctuations by using the @xcite merger tree algorithm to generate the unresolved halos .",
    "this algorithm partitions a cell with mass @xmath58 into halos and , for a white noise power spectrum , produces the correct average abundance of halos , @xmath72 , as well as the correct statistical fluctuations around this mean .",
    "the algorithm is guaranteed to work only for a white noise power spectrum , but @xcite show that it works well at reproducing @xmath73 and other relevant statistics for more general power spectra .",
    "this algorithm allows us to generate a spatially and temporally consistent merger history tree .",
    "we find , for the small mass halos of interest , that the algorithm generally produces more halos than the press - schechter prediction . to compensate , we lower @xmath22 slightly in the merger history computation to achieve the best agreement with the press - schechter mass function for our fiducial cosmology .",
    "figure [ fig : mf ] shows the halo mass function measured from our simulations at @xmath74 ( _ circles _ ) , @xmath75 ( _ x s _ ) and @xmath76 ( _ asterisks _ ) .",
    "the merger history tree generates halos below @xmath77 , whereas the other , more massive halos are resolved in the simulation .",
    "the solid curves are press - schechter and the dashed curves are sheth - tormen mass functions for these redshifts .",
    "the mass function from the merger tree agrees best with press - schechter and fairly well with sheth - tormen , particularly at the lower two redshifts  the most relevant redshifts for this study .",
    "note that the abundance of resolved halos in our simulation is closer to the sheth - tormen mass function than to the press - schechter .",
    "the merger history tree algorithm generates the halos in lagrangian space , requiring us to then map them to eulerian space .",
    "the progenitor halos  the halos at the lowest redshift bin such that they sit on the top of a merger history tree  are generated within each coarse cell on a @xmath78 grid in lagrangian space , and they are then randomly associated with one of the fine cells within its respective coarse cell ( typically there are @xmath79 fine cells ) .",
    "this randomization is justified by the fact that poisson fluctuations dominate over cosmological fluctuations at the scale of the coarse cell . to map our halos to eulerian space in a self - consistent manner",
    ", we associate each progenitor halo with a particle whose initial ( lagrangian ) position is the center of the same fine cell as the lagrangian position of the halo .",
    "we then displace the particle at each redshift according to second order lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite . at higher redshifts",
    ", we split the progenitor halo into its daughter halos , and all daughter halos are associated with the same particle as their parent .",
    "this method for adding unresolved halos is similar to the pt halo algorithm , an algorithm to quickly generate mock galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel in figure [ fig : mtps ] plots the mass - weighted halo power spectrum @xmath80 at @xmath81 from a @xmath0 , @xmath82 mpc box simulation that resolves halos down to the cooling mass ( _ dotted curve _ ) .",

    "mpc box is missing modes larger than the size of the box , we expect that it underestimates the true spectrum of cosmological fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a larger box with the same mass resolution would result in better agreement between the solid and dotted curves . ]",
    "the level of agreement between the dotted and solid curves demonstrates that the merger tree method reliably incorporates the small mass halos in our simulations .",
    "the thin solid curve is an analytic prediction for the halo power spectrum given by @xmath86 , in which @xmath87 is calculated using the peacock and dodds fitting formula for the density power spectrum , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the press - schechter bias for a halo of mass @xmath48 [ at @xmath81 , @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "this analytic estimate for @xmath80 ignores poisson fluctuations , and a comparison with the other curves indicates that poisson fluctuations are important on scales of @xmath91 .",
    "the top panel in figure [ fig : mtps ] shows the mass - weighted power spectrum of halos above the cooling threshold from the merger history tree method ( _ solid curves _ ) and of the halos that are well resolved in our box with @xmath92 ( _ dashed curves _ ) at @xmath93 ( _ thin curves _ ) and @xmath94 ( _ thick curves _ ) .",
    "the different spectrum of fluctuations between the solid and dashed curves suggests that incorporating the unresolved halos may lead to a different hii morphology . as the source halos become rarer , their spatial fluctuations increase and",
    "the poisson component of the fluctuations becomes more important .",

    "halo mass resolution is extended beyond @xmath38 with a merger tree . here , ` yes ' means the source halo resolution is supplemented with the merger tree down to @xmath96 .",
    "now that we have a method for incorporating small mass halos into our simulations , we examine several prescriptions for populating the dark matter halos with ionizing sources .",
    "we consider models where popii - like sources are responsible for the vast majority of the ionizing photons .",

    ", we normalized the photon production in the s2 , s3 and s4 runs so that the same number of photons are outputted in each time step as in s1 . in reality , as rarer sources dominate the ionizing budget , the rate at which the universe is ionized quickens because the number of high mass halos is growing exponentially .",
    "here we are interested in the structure of reionization , which is not significantly affected by the duration of this epoch .",
    "the luminosity of our sources only depends on the halo mass .",
    "this parametrization is most reasonable if , once the gas has cooled within a halo , the timescale for its conversion into stars is at least comparable to the duration of reionization ( or a few hundred million years ) .",
    "@xcite measure a gas - to - star conversion timescale of over a gigayear in simulations of high redshift galaxies . however , many works in the literature parameterize star formation as proportional to the time derivative of the collapse fraction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the effects of alternative parameterizations of star formation on reionization are discussed at the end of this section .",
    "the source prescriptions in s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 are all still reasonable in principle .",
    "the least massive systems could dominate the budget of ionizing photons because it may be easier for ionizing photons to escape from the smallest mass halos .",

    "we find that the morphology of reionization is very similar between this parameterization and that of the constant mass - to - light model .",
    "the reason for this similarity is that the collapse fraction in a given region is changing nearly exponentially with time and so the rate of halo mass growth is proportional to the halo mass .",

    "since photo - heating can suppress subsequent accretion onto these objects , eventually this reservoir will run dry and all the gas will have been converted to stars .",
    "the timescale over which this reservoir will be depleted is uncertain ( see discussion in  [ sources ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass threshold at which sources will be suppressed by photo - heating is fairly unconstrained .",
    "often the suppression mass scale is taken to be the linear theory jeans mass @xmath148 .",

    "the effect of feedback in our simulations is even less significant .",
    "if the highest mass sources are more efficient at producing ionizing photons , reionization will be extended by a smaller amount by feedback than we find , whereas if the low mass sources are more efficient , feedback will extend reionization by a larger amount . the conclusion",
    "that the structure of reionization is only modestly affected by feedback holds even if the sources near @xmath142 are more efficient at producing ionizing photons then we have assumed : we found in  [ sources ] that as we made the low mass sources more efficient , the properties of the hii regions are essentially unchanged ( compare the panels from s1 and s2 in fig .

    "these parameterizations will be essential for modeling the end of reionization , a time when the rate of evaporation of the lyman - limit systems plays a key role in determining the structure of reionization .",
    "also , such parameterizations are necessary to extend our calculations to model accurately the part in @xmath31 neutral fraction fluctuations that characterize the high redshift ly@xmath6 forest .",
    "an accurate interpretation of future observations of reionization , while certainly challenging , does not appear impossible .",
    "the characteristics of hii regions during reionization might have depended on a huge number of poorly constrained parameters , making it impossible to interpret observations of this epoch .",
    "we find that this is not the case .",
    "the morphology of the hii regions at fixed @xmath2 boils down primarily to the properties of the sources and of the minihalos / lyman - limit systems .",
    "we thank mark dijkstra for helpful conversations regarding thermal feedback and ly@xmath6 emitters , volker springel for providing his lean gadget2 code , roman scoccimarro for providing his 2lpt code , and steven furlanetto for useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "mm would like to thank the nsf graduate student fellowship .",
    "the authors are also supported by the david and lucile packard foundation , the alfred p. sloan foundation , and nasa grants ast-0506556 and nng05gj40 g .",
    "for the simulations in this paper , we employ the @xcite cosmological radiative transfer code , but with several significant changes that are discussed below .",
    "this algorithm inputs grids of the density field as well as a list of sources and then casts rays from every source , randomizing the order of the sources within this loop .",
    "radiative feedback on the density field is ignored .",
    "rays are split adaptively using the healpix algorithm @xcite such that , at a minimum , @xmath340 rays from a source intersect every cell face ( for this paper , we set @xmath341 ) . this algorithm does not iterate the ray casting within each time step to converge to",
    "the correct ionized fraction in each cell . instead",
    ", once a cell has been ionized by a source within a time step , rays from other sources will pass through it .",
    "this simplification allows for the algorithm to process more sources and larger volumes than other codes . in the limit of few sources and few time steps",
    ", this simplification can lead to artificial structure in the hii regions .",
    "however , with the vast number of sources in the simulations in this paper , even with relatively coarse time steps we choose , this artificial structure is minimized ( as we will demonstrate later in this section ) .",
    "the temperature history of the gas is not tracked by this code .",
    "instead , the code assumes that ionized regions are at @xmath342 kelvin .",
    "the temperature affects the number of recombinations in the simulation because @xmath343 , as well as the detailed photo - ionization state of the gas within the hii regions .",
    "the analysis we have done in this paper does not depend on the photo - ionization state of the gas .",
    "in addition , the value for the subgrid clumping factor , which determines the number of recombinations with in a cell , is highly uncertain , such that we would not gain any precision from including a full calculation of the igm temperature .",
    "what follows is a list of the important modifications that we have made to the original @xcite algorithm :    * previously , cells were either ionized or neutral .",
    "cells can now be fractionally ionized .",
    "we assume that the ionizing front is paper thin such that each cell can be broken up into a neutral part and an ionized part . *",
    "each ray holds a number of photons . in the original @xcite algorithm , the first ray that hit a cell from a particular source carried all the information that the cell needed about the source .",
    "subsequent rays from the same source did not affect the cell .",
    "the advantage to having each ray contain a specific number of photons is that it is trivial to conserve photons as well as to include photon sinks .",
    "the disadvantage is that the ionization front has a numerical width that is wider than in the previous algorithm .",
    "we find that the width of the front in the new algorithm is approximately @xmath344 cells for a single source .",
    "the thickness of the front is smaller than @xmath344 cells in the limit relevant to this paper of many faint sources . * the orientation of the healpix ray casting scheme",
    "is randomly rotated between each time step , and the order with which the rays are initially cast is also randomized .",
    "when rays split adaptively , the order is again randomized over the daughter rays .",
    "all of this randomization is done to minimize artifacts owing to the order in which operations are performed .",
    "* once a ray has traveled a distance equal to @xmath345^{1/3}$ ] , it can no longer split into daughter rays , where @xmath346 is the ionizing luminosity from the source and @xmath347 is the total luminosity of all the sources in the box .",
    "we set @xmath348 for this paper . until this distance ,",
    "rays split adaptively such that a set number of rays intersect every cell face .",
    "this simplification is justified by the large numbers of sources in an hii region ( typically more than @xmath323 sources ) , making it unnecessary to have rays from one side of an hii region cover the entire front on the other side .",
    "our approximation results in the correct fluxes in the cells in the limit of many sources . we have investigated quantitatively whether this simplification makes a difference in the ionization maps .",
    "the middle panel in figure [ fig : convergence ] plots the cross correlation coefficient at two times between a simulation with no ray termination and a simulation with the prescription for ray termination used in this paper ( see the caption in fig . [",
    "fig : convergence ] for the definition of the cross correlation coefficient ) .",
    "there is essentially no difference between the maps .",
    "this simplification results in the algorithm running over a factor of @xmath349 faster at high ionized fractions . *",
    "the previous algorithm reset the density in each cell after a time step to the density field in the next snapshot , but did not change the ionized fraction in the cell to account for the dynamics of the ionization field .",
    "for example , a cell that becomes fully ionized would remain fully ionized in subsequent time steps ( neglecting recombinations ) , even if it gained neutral material from a neighboring cell during these time steps .",
    "this resulted in the total number of ionized atoms not being conserved by the previous algorithm between time steps . to remedy this issue in the current algorithm , we account for a dynamic density field by assigning some ionization fraction to each particle in the n - body simulation and then re - gridding the ionization map between time steps to account for the particle dynamics .",
    "we suspect that other cosmological radiative transfer algorithms performed on top of a static density grid ignore the dynamics of the ionization field in their computations .",
    "* n - body particles that are associated with halos are not included in the density field used by the radiative transfer algorithm .",
    "otherwise , cells with sources would have substantial overdensities , and ionizing photons from within the cell would have to ionize these cells prior to escaping into the igm .",
    "these absorptions are already counted in the escape fraction .",
    "removing the halo particles from the gridded density field is also appropriate for rays incident on this cell .",
    "the gas in the massive source halos has cooled to form a small disk that is much smaller than the cross section of the cell .",
    "therefore , the vast majority of photons coming from exterior to the cell do not intersect this disk .",
    "the gas within galaxies during reionization absorbs a negligible amount of external photons because the mean free path of these photons to intersect a galaxy is large ( larger than the @xmath1 mpc box size employed in this paper ) .",
    "we subjected the radiative transfer algorithm to several tests .",
    "as a simple test , we put one source with @xmath350 in a @xmath351 mpc / h box with @xmath79 cells , with each cell at the mean density of the @xmath352 universe , and set the clumping factor @xmath353 in each cell to @xmath354 or @xmath355 . in figure",
    "[ fig : recomb_test ] , we compare the fraction of the box that is ionized in this test to the fraction that is predicted by theory ( using coarse time steps of @xmath356 years ) .",
    "even with such coarse time steps , this algorithm matches the theory curves well .    because the algorithm does not iterate to find the ionized fraction , this might lead to artificial structure if the time step is too coarse . in the limit of an infinitely small time step , this algorithm gives us the exact solution . in this paper",
    "we use a time step of @xmath33 million years . to test convergence ,",
    "we run two cosmological simulations on the @xmath79 grid ( which we label simulation 1 and 2 ) , using the halos with @xmath357 as our sources .",
    "each simulation uses a different set of random numbers to establish the order of the sources for ray casting .",
    "if the 50 million year time step is too coarse , the ionization maps from these two simulations would differ substantially , whereas the time step is sufficiently small if the ionization maps differ insignificantly . the bottom panel of figure [ fig : convergence ] plots the cross correlation coefficient @xmath358 between these two runs for ionization fractions of @xmath359 ( _ solid curves _ ) and @xmath174 ( _ dashed curves _ ) .",
    "the cross correlation coefficient is close to unity at most scales , dropping to @xmath44 at the cell scale .",
    "note that the cross correlation coefficient is a stringent test .",
    "we have also looked at the power spectrum of these runs .",
    "the power spectrum of the ionized fraction differs negligibly between these two runs , differing by about @xmath360 at @xmath361 and @xmath362 at @xmath363 .",
    "we have also investigated whether the ionization structure seen in our fiducial runs has converged to the true structure by either increasing the number of rays that are cast or by increasing the mesh size to @xmath196 .",
    "first , we ran with a simulation that casts a much larger number of rays per source than the fiducial number of rays ( @xmath364 more initially and with the criteria that a minimum of @xmath365 rather than @xmath366 rays intersect every cell ) .",
    "we find that the fiducial number of rays is enough to capture the structure of the hii region ( _ top panel _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] ) .",
    "second , we have run a resolution test , comparing a higher resolution @xmath196 radiative transfer simulation without recombinations to a @xmath79 run without recombinations .",
    "we re - grid the @xmath196 snapshots to @xmath79 resolution for comparison .",
    "we find that for all @xmath2 the power spectra have converged to within @xmath175 at scales with @xmath367 .",
    "the agreement is even better then this for @xmath368 .",
    "the computation speed of this code scales in a time step as @xmath369 where @xmath370 is the number of rays through each cell , @xmath371 is the characteristic bubble size , @xmath372 is the number of sources .",
    "when the bubbles are large , the code slows down considerably .",
    "we are working on ways to ameliorate this issue with the code .",
    "most simulations in this paper took less than two days to reach @xmath43 on a single @xmath42 ghz amd opteron processor .",
    "@xcite provide fitting formula for the evaporation of minihalos by popii stars .",
    "these simulations do full radiative hydrodynamics on minihalos , which are modeled prior to front crossing as truncated isothermal spheres ( tis ) with self similar infall .",
    "they provide the formula for the evaporation timescale @xmath373   ~ { \\rm myr } , \\label{eqn : teviliev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath374 is the flux ( which is time - independent in their simulations ) . to apply these formula to simulation m2",
    ", we use for @xmath374 the time averaged flux incident on a cell , with averaging starting after the cell becomes ionized .    in figure 29 in @xcite ,",
    "the effective cross section of a halo for absorbing an ionizing photon as a function of time is plotted for a @xmath375 halo .",
    "@xcite does not provide parameterized fits to the effective cross section , which we need in our calculations .",
    "to proceed , we fit by eye the curve for the effective cross section in @xcite .",
    "we find the function @xmath376 where @xmath377^{1/3 } \\ , 10/(1 + z)$ ] is the scale radius for the tis profile . by construction in the simulations of @xcite , @xmath378 at @xmath379 .",
    "however , on a timescale of order a million years the outskirts of the halo are evaporated , consuming a meager amount of photons .",
    "the denser inner regions take a significantly longer time to evaporate .",
    "we set @xmath378 for the first @xmath349 million years , and subsequently use equation ( [ eqn : shapcross ] ) in run m2 .",
    "of course , the function we use for @xmath234 likely does not scale correctly with redshift or halo mass .",
    "we anticipate that it over - predicts the cross section for halos with @xmath380 , since the gas in the outskirts of these smaller halos will be easier to evaporate .",
    "if all of the gas in the igm is cold before reionization and subsequently jumps to @xmath31 k at @xmath381 , the filtering mass is @xcite @xmath382\\right)^{3/2}. \\label{eq : fm}\\ ] ] this mass scale can be much smaller than the jeans mass for @xmath31 k gas @xmath148 and is typically time dependent .",
    "since @xmath189 typically corresponds to non - linear scales where linear theory is a poor approximation , it is unclear how well equation ( [ eq : fm ] ) represents the smallest mass at which the baryons clump .",
    "however , @xcite smooth n - body simulations by including a pressure force that becomes important at the filtering scale .",
    "they conclude that this procedure reproduces well the small - scale gas power spectrum seen in hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "furthermore , @xcite finds that the filtering mass provides a good fit to the minimum formation mass for a gas - rich halo ."
