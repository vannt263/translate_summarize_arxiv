    "the spontaneous reversal of the direction of the toroidal rotation in tokamak has been observed as a change accompanying the l to h transition or a slow variation of a plasma parameter , like the current or the magnetic field @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "spontaneous reversal has also been observed in tcv beyond a threshold in the density @xcite .",
    "a review of these experimental facts can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are several properties of the state of the system that seem to be correlated with the transition consisting of the flow reversal .",
    "there is a strong radial gradient of temperature which is sustained by external input of energy into plasma . in general fluid configurations placed under strong thermal stress [ for example in the classical rayleigh - benard ( rb ) system ] the purely conductive state is replaced by a convective regime through generation of cells of convection @xcite .",
    "the transport of heat and of momentum and angular momentum ( via the reynolds stress ) become much more efficient compared with the diffusive regime .",
    "the onset of the convection structure takes place on short time scale compared with conduction or flow time scales .",
    "the event leading to formation of a regular convection pattern starts with the generation of isolated hot and cold streamers ( also called  `` plumes '' or  `` thermals '' ) that advance into the fluid environment @xcite .",
    "the head of the streamer is deformed through interaction with the static fluid leading to  `` mushroom '' shapes also known from rayleigh - taylor experiments .",
    "the streamer breaks down leaving vortices of two signs .",
    "these vortices are merging eventually creating the large scale flow , a mechanism which is universally associated to relaxation kraichnanmontg , @xcite . under strong temperature gradient",
    "the whole process is very fast .",
    "the presence and/or the possible generation of closed , quasi - coherent convective flows in the meridional cross section of the tokamak plasma is a well investigated subject .",
    "the particular case of the zonal flows is included as a subset in this wide class of organized flows ( for reviews see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "various mechanisms have been identified to be able to transfer energy  from the drift wave turbulence to the flow in a convective structure extending over a substantial part of the plasma cross section .",
    "modulational instability , wave - kinetic dynamical transfers in the spectral space , multi - scale interactions leading to negative viscosity are usually invoked shuklaphysreva , @xcite , @xcite , shukla - eur .",
    "a unifying and universal principle is the inverse cascade of energy in the two - dimensional turbulence @xcite , shapiro1 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "vortical structures consisting of robust and coherent flow have been identified in regimes governed by the hasegawa - mima and hasegawa - wakatani equations horton1 . due to the essential role of the vectorial nonlinearity",
    "the space scales of the these structures is initially at the level of the ion larmor radius . the processes or merging lead further to creation of large scale structure .",
    "another mechanism that has been studied is the tilting instability of eddies with creation , via reynolds stress , of flows over large spatial regions @xcite .",
    "the structure is usually assumed with alternate sense of rotation , for several reasons .",
    "one of them is the conservation of the angular momentum integrated over the space occupied by the cells of convection .",
    "this conditions is however imposed to closed systems , and even for them is not quite stringent @xcite .",
    "a different reason comes from assuming the flow as a perturbation , expanding in fourier series and retaining the lowest order which by its nature is periodic and leads to vortices with alternating sense of rotation @xcite .",
    "it also provides compatible flows at the common boundaries of the neighbor cells .",
    "the latter argument should not be seen as a strong restriction if the distance between the rolls of convection is sufficiently large .",
    "finally we mention a condition related with the space - time invariances of the equations , which appears to underlay this choice of the pattern of flow . taking as a propotype the hasegawa - mima equation one notes the invariance to reversal of the sign of the vorticity , which implicitely imposes the presence in the solution of vortices of both signs .",
    "however it has been shown that besides the vectorial nonlinearity the _ scalar _ or korteweg - devries nonlinearity , of the type @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the streamfunction and @xmath2 the poloidal coordinate , is likely to be present in the equation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although it does not influence the smaller scales where the instabilities are developing , it controls the large scales due to the lower differential degree .",
    "this breaks the invariance and allows solutions consisting of a set of rolls with unique sense of rotation .",
    "we argue that rolls of convection having the same direction of rotating flow are not excluded by any characteristic of the differential equations governing the quasi - two - dimensional tokamak plasma and are even more efficient for the transport of angular momentum in the meridional section . this pattern of flow has been derived @xcite and it arises in many similar situations . in the science of atmosphere it is known that a distribution of azimuthal velocity in a vortex can be affected by perturbations leading to secondary vortices that move around the core of the parent system schubert .",
    "the geometry of the flow takes the form of a polygonal eye - wall , which means that a set of smaller vortices are placed symmetrically , with their centers placed on a circle around the eye - wall axis kossinschubert .",
    "they all have the same sign of vorticity .",
    "other examples are accretion disks @xcite and the ranque - hilsch vortex tube colgate .    in tokamak",
    "there is a poloidal rotation at equilibrium , due to the _ neoclassical _ processes .",
    "the poloidal flow is sheared since part of the plasma cross section is in plateau - banana and part is in pfirsch - schluter regime @xcite .",
    "this just constitutes a _ seed _ which may favor a choice of the direction of rotation of the rolls that are going to be created .",
    "a source of flow that appears to be less investigated is the baroclinic term arising in the momentum equation of the ion component when it is transformed by a rotational operator into the equation for toroidally projected vorticity .",
    "it is well suited to exhibit local velocity shear that may accelerate plasma flow , leading for example to generation of streamers .",
    "as shown below , the streamers constitute a basic agent for building up larger scale flows .",
    "it is well known that the rb transition from purely conductive to a convective regime takes place at a threshold , where the buoyancy force overcomes the viscosity @xcite . in the present case",
    "the threshold has a different nature .",
    "the drive force in the early stage is the baroclinic term , dependent on the main gradients of the density and temperature , which are supported by the external input .",
    "convective cells are likely to be created , as shown by numerous investigations ( analytical , numerical , observations )",
    ". the pattern should obey the symmetries required by the basic neoclassical rotation which favors formation of rolls all rotating in the same sense , equivalently , with the same sign of toroidally - directed vorticity .",
    "there is no restriction upon this choice coming from the conservation of the angular momentum in the meridional plane since momentum is carried away to the boundary ( the system is open ) .",
    "now , the peripheric velocities of the chain of large scale vortical cells constitues an effective poloidal rotation .",
    "the magnetic pumping opposes the poloidal rotation via the parallel viscosity which acts on a time scale determined by the ion - ion collision frequency @xcite .",
    "this leads us to formulate a threshold condition : the gradients of density and temperature should be sufficiently high such as the baroclinic term to sustain the rolls and their induced poloidal flow against the parallel viscosity damping .",
    "the detailed examination of this threshold condition requires more quantitative analysis and will not be of the present concern .",
    "we develop a model based on the following phenomenology :    \\(1 ) the increase of the gradient of the pressure triggers formation of cells of convection .",
    "the process is similar to the transition from purely conductive to convective regime in rayleigh - benard fluid but the rolls of convection have a single sign of vorticity ; the baroclinic term drives a fast onset of this pattern of flow ;    \\(2 ) the peripheric velocities of the convection cells ( with unique sense of rotation ) coalesce into an envelope which is equivalent to a poloidal rotation ; in usual circumstances the poloidal rotation is damped by the parallel viscosity ( magnetic pumping ) but this is now overcomed by the reynolds stress in the regular pattern which is directly sustained by the gradients of density and temperature .",
    "these are , in turn , sustained by the external input .",
    "\\(3 ) the fast increase of poloidal flow induces a high time derivative of the radial electric field @xmath3 .",
    "the radial momentum balance would allow to divide the effect of an increase of the @xmath4 term to the two other terms , containing the diamagnetic and respectively the toroidal velocities . however",
    "the reaction of the diamagnetic velocity is slower since it depends on the change of the density profile and the change of the toroidal flow velocity is mediated by a neoclassical effect .",
    "\\(4 ) the neoclassical polarization induced by the variation of the radial electric field creates a series of parallel accelerations ( kick on every bounce ) of the trapped ions , leading to an increase of the toroidal precession or to its reversal ; the source of energy is the work done by the fast transient growth of @xmath3 supported in turn by the pressure gradient through the convection .",
    "\\(5 ) the diffusion transfers on resistive scale the toroidal momentum from the trapped ions to the untrapped ones , inducing the reversal of direction .",
    "the point ( 4 ) roughly describes this situation : on half of the banana ( say in the same direction as the magnetic field @xmath5 ) the trapped ion feels a certain radial electric field and when it returns on the other half of the banana orbit ( opposite to @xmath5 ) it already is acted upon by a different radial electric field .",
    "the key is that the change of the radial electric field and the ion bounce on banana take place on comparable time scales .",
    "this is possible due to the fast onset of convection and can be the explanation of the fast transitions observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "our model is similar to an  inverse ranque - hilsch  effect . in the ranque - hilsch vortex ( not fully understood at this time ) a strong rotation of a gas leads to temperature separation @xcite and it is supposed that coherent vortical structures that breaks the azimuthal symmetry of the flow are responsible for the creation of the gradient of temperature @xcite . in our case",
    "we dispose of the strong temperature gradient across the plasma section and the onset of cells of convection ( which break the azimuthal symmetry ) would create the other element , _ i.e. _ the poloidal flow .",
    "the process is sustained by the heat and density input which is converted into mechanical stress ( radial variation of poloidal rotation ) by the cells of convection .",
    "it is transitory with a fast phase ( when the reversal occurs ) followed by a slower variation which keeps the time derivative of the radial electric field at the level required for balancing the parallel viscosity damping .",
    "we focus in the present work on the logical consistency of the argument , examining the contributing physical processes under certain simplifications .",
    "the overall result confirms the validity of the model and justifies further study .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we explain the role of the baroclinic term in sustaining the perturbations consisting of hot streamers advancing along the minor radius .",
    "the estimations shows that the time scale of the convection is very fast .",
    "separately we provide an argument for the poloidal flow of the density toward the place of origin of the streamer , preventing a local depression of density and suppression or breaking up of the hot streamer .",
    "this argument is based on another manifestation of the baroclinic effect , which in this case reveals the possiblity of the instability called chaplygin gas , or anomalous polytropic .",
    "the next section is devoted to demonstrate that the peripheric velocity of the rolls of convection leads to an effective poloidal flow .",
    "the argument is here geometric and on this basis one can easily superpose physical processes like reynolds stress and collisional diffusion of the momentum in the vecinity of the rolls of convection .",
    "the last part consists of simply adapting the arguments of hinton and robertson @xcite to show that the neoclassical polarization induces an acceleration of the toroidal motion of the bananas .",
    "we consider a perturbation in the two - dimensional section of a tokamak plasma , consisting of the radial displacement of an element of plasma from the radius @xmath6 to higher radii , _",
    "i.e. _ to toward the edge . for fast motion",
    "the element preserves its temperature and advances as a stream of hot plasma to higher @xmath7 .",
    "the figure 1 shows the geometry of the perturbation fixing also the system of reference @xmath8 .",
    "the smooth surface represents the equilibrium pressure profile on which it is superposed the perturbation related to the advancing hot streamer .",
    "the curved arrow shows the effect of the baroclinic term .",
    "the two arrows at the right of the perturbations have the following meaning : the one directed against the perturbation represents the @xmath9 of the hot stream relative to the environment .",
    "the one poining approximately in the inverse @xmath10 direction is the gradient of the equilibrium density ( or mass ) , @xmath11 .    the density at the radius where the streamer begins its motion",
    "is @xmath12 and the temperature at the same location is @xmath13 .",
    "the displacement of the hot plasma element along the radius is @xmath14 which is positive in our system . on this distance the equilibrium ( background ) pressure",
    "has varied and has the value@xmath15where @xmath16 on an usual equilibrium pressure profile .",
    "this @xmath17 is the pressure in the environment plasma at a distance @xmath18 from the point of initialization of the thermal streamer . assuming that there is no loss of heat via diffusion the hot stream will have at the same position the pressure @xmath19 .",
    "the gradient due to this contrast between the hot streamer and the environment is directed ( along poloidal direction at @xmath7 ) from the boundary of the thermal streamer to its axis .",
    "we will choose to look at the left side of the hot streamer which means that the gradient of the pressure is directed along the positive @xmath2 axis , @xmath20 .",
    "the width of the hot stream is of the order of the radius of the roll , @xmath21 and the gradient of pressure transversal on the axis of the streamer is@xmath22 in order to keep a realistic set of assumptions we must consider the loss of heat from the streamer via conduction to the environment plasma . an elementary option is to introduce an arbitrary nondimensional small factor @xmath23 and consider from now on the fraction @xmath24 of the perturbation of the pressure . now",
    ", the gradient of the perturbed pressure interacts with the equilibrium gradient of the density @xmath25 to give the baroclinic term@xmath26and using eq.([eq101 ] ) we have @xmath27the two quantities : the depth of penetration of the streamer @xmath18 and the radius of the cell of convection @xmath21 produced by the roll - up of the streamer have similar magnitudes and we approximate@xmath28the baroclinic term is directed along the negative @xmath29 ( toroidal ) axis and enhances the local gradients of the velocity of the streamer : the velocity on the axis of the hot streamer is accelerated . with this specification of the direction of the enhancement of the velocity by the time - derivative of the local vorticity , we will only take from now on its absolute value @xmath30here @xmath31 is the speed of the hot streamer , along its axis .",
    "the interval of time @xmath32 will later be taken a characteristic turn - over of the convection roll .",
    "the gradient length of the equilibrium pressure is@xmath33with both terms having the same sign , negative along the increasing minor radius direction . from eqs.([eq105 ] ) and ( [ eq106 ] ) we have the estimation @xmath34now , if we assume that the gradient length of the density is much larger than @xmath35 , we will retain only the second term in the paranthesis@xmath36taking@xmath37we obtain@xmath38the gradient of the equilibrium temperature at the position and on the spatial extension of the convection roll must be a fraction of the gross estimation @xmath39 and we introduce an arbitrary nondimansional small parameter @xmath40 @xmath41it results@xmath42except for the two small parameters @xmath24 and @xmath40 this formula shows that the speed of rotation at the periphery of the roll is very high , comparable with the ion thermal velocity . including a rough estimation for the conductive loss ( similar to the rayleigh - benard case ) by the factor @xmath43 and the variation of the equilibrium temperature over the cell s extension , by the factor @xmath44 , we still get a high value @xmath45 .",
    "the perturbation is initiated at a radius @xmath6 , which means that the density in a small region around the circle @xmath6 will flow toward the point ( say @xmath46 ) where the streamer originates . there",
    "the poloidal aflux is converted into radial flow of the hot streamer .",
    "this radial flow is accelerated by the baroclinic effect and from the eq.([eq112 ] ) we see that the speed can reach high values .",
    "a local depression of density can occur if the rate of filling with density the foot of the streamer takes place at a rate which is slower than that with which it is removed by the streamer .",
    "this is an important aspect which we examine in the following .",
    "the continuity equation with only the velocity along the streamer is@xmath47or@xmath48the radial velocity @xmath49 is zero for radii smaller than @xmath6 and rises to an almost constant value on a small radial distance @xmath50 .",
    "the equation of continuity becomes@xmath51where @xmath52 .",
    "the solution is@xmath53",
    "= \\ln n\\left [ r\\left ( t_{0}\\right ) % \\right ] -\\int_{t_{0}}^{t}dt^{\\prime } v_{r}\\delta \\left [ r\\left ( t\\right ) -r_{0}\\right ]   \\label{eq116}\\]]where the integral along the trajectory is the inverse of the lagrangian derivation @xmath54 .",
    "the expression shows that the density is simply carried along the streamer , with a discontinuity in the small region at the foot of the streamer .",
    "this leads to a depression of density if the neighbor regions are not providing aflux of particles .",
    "we will show that there is an instability consisting of strong modulation of the density on the poloidal circle @xmath6 which can lead to accumulation of density in periodic poloidal positions .",
    "although this instability and the formation of the streamer are independent , they can act concurrently , avoiding suppression of the streamer or its breaking up with further propagation as blob .",
    "this is the reason for which we examine now the poloidal modulation of the density when a conjunctural factor ( the streamer ) imposes a flow along @xmath55 .",
    "assuming incompressibility @xmath56 in the small region around the streamer s foot we have @xmath57 with comparable variation scales @xmath58 .",
    "the two velocities , @xmath4 and @xmath59 are therefore related @xmath60 .",
    "accordingly , the acceleration of the streamer velocity @xmath61 along the radius induces an accelaration of the flow @xmath4 on the poloidal circle.@xmath62which simply means that the time variation of the velocity in the streamer is also the time variation of the poloidal dynamics .    from now on our considerations will be refering to the poloidal direction only , more precisely to a narrow region around the circle of radius @xmath6 where the hot streamer is born .",
    "as said before the acceleration on the radial direction of the flow in the hot streamer induces an acceleration of the aflux of particles , along the poloidal circle , @xmath63 , toward the foot of the streamer . in this region the dynamics along the hot streamer , essentially radial , is coupled to the dynamics along the poloidal circle .",
    "if the main characteristic of the hot streamer is the contrast of temperature relative to the environment in which it advances , the dynamics along the poloidal region regards essentially the density .",
    "this is because the temperature on the circle is constant while the particles must flow toward the streamer s foot to sustain the streamer flux and this generates density perturbation .",
    "we introduce the density @xmath64 on the circle and we have that in the region of perturbation induced by the streamer , @xmath65 .",
    "the problem becomes one - dimensional , along the circle @xmath6 , with the coordinate @xmath66 and we take the origin of @xmath2 at the axis of the streamer , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath67 at @xmath46 . for uniformity",
    ", we change the notation , @xmath68 .",
    "a new manifestation of the baroclinic effect takes place along the poloidal direction .",
    "we first remind the case of the streamer , where the baroclinic force arises from the contrast of temperature between the hot streamer and the environment , in combination with the gradient of the background density .",
    "now the baroclinic effect arises from the perturbation of density along the poloidal direction , in combination with the gradient of the equilibrium pressure , @xmath69 , in which the gradient of the equilibrium temperature @xmath70 is active .",
    "assume that due to the flux of particles towards the foot of the streamer @xmath67 there is a perturbation in the form of a lump of density at this point , .",
    "we have , focusing our considerations on the left side of the hot streamer , @xmath71 , @xmath72the effect of this baroclinic force is to enhance the flow along @xmath2 toward @xmath73 . taking a distance on @xmath2 of perturbation of @xmath74 of the scale as the radius of the rolls of convection , @xmath21 , we have an estimation of the effect on velocity coming from the left to @xmath67 , the axis of the streamer . there is acceleration@xmath75 = r\\frac{1}{\\rho } \\frac{% \\partial \\rho } { \\partial y}\\left\\vert \\frac{\\partial \\left ( t_{0}/m_{i}\\right ) } { \\partial r}\\right\\vert   \\label{eq119}\\]]and the balance of forces along @xmath2 is@xmath76we set@xmath77with dimensions of squared velocity .    we will express the term in the right hand side as a derivation to @xmath2 , such as to exhibit the structure of the force resulting from the gradient of a scalar _ pressure _ , which we will have to identify .",
    "this means to find a function @xmath78 such as @xmath79we obtain@xmath80and this allows us to characterize the term arising from the _ baroclinic _ effect as a force produced by the @xmath2-gradient of a pressure@xmath81where the equivalent pressure , as a scalar function whose gradient is the force , is identified as@xmath82and is _",
    "negative_. the equations of motion for an element of plasma situated on the poloidal circle at radius @xmath6 consists of the deformation displacements in the poloidal direction due to the force generated from the gradient of the scalar pressure@xmath83and the continuity equation@xmath84    the same problem has been treated by ott @xcite where the temperature is _ negative_. the pressure in the present case is _ negative _ with _ linear _ dependence on the perturbation of the density .",
    "this is the typical @xmath85 case of the general treatment of trubnikov and zhdanov trubnikov .    in the appendix",
    "a we show , following trubnikov and zhdanov @xcite , how this system is solved .",
    "the solution has the following characteristic : the density on the poloidal circle has regions of broad , quasi - uniform magnitude separated by very high ( spiky ) accumulations . in the actual physical process",
    "the strong accumulations coincide with the initialization of the hot streamers and effectively support the flow of density they represent .",
    "we comment on the applicability of the results obtained from the model of anomalous polytropic gas to the physical problem of breaking of the azimuthal symmetry of the density and flow in tokamak with generation of radial streamers and further of rolls of convection .",
    "we have two distinct processes : ( 1 ) a hot stream of plasma leaving the region at radius @xmath6 and advancing in the colder environment at higher @xmath86 , sustained by a baroclinic force .",
    "the baroclinic force is generated by the combined effect of the contrast of temperature between the streamer and the environment and the gradient of equilibrium density profile .",
    "it is a fast process and a density depletion around @xmath6 can appear .",
    "( 2 ) an instability of the density profile along the poloidal direction at @xmath6 , again sustained by a baroclinic effect .",
    "this is determined by the combination between the gradient of the perturbed density along @xmath55 and the gradient of the equilibrium pressure .",
    "the effect is generation of high accumulation of density at periodic positions along the poloidal direction .",
    "these two processes are interacting : the tendency of accumulation of density at certain location on the poloidal circle supports the flow in the streamers .",
    "the decrease of the density at @xmath6 by the streamer flow is compensated by the aflux of density associated to the ( chaplygin gas - type ) instability of the density on @xmath55 .",
    "observations and numerical simulations suggest that the streamers ( `` plumes '' or  `` thermals '' ) of hot fluid inhibit the instability on the transversal direction by the high rate of radial flow which sometimes lead to breaking - up of streamer from its original region and separation as a blob .",
    "the system of equations describing the instability in the early phase can be reduced to an @xmath87 model of a gas with anomalous polytropic ( the pressure is negative and @xmath88 ) .",
    "the solution consists of regions of broad and smooth variation of the variables @xmath89 and very localised , spiky regions of high concentration of density .",
    "the instability of chaplygin gas is fast : the streamers ( which appear in the model as concentrations of density ) are formed on a time scale given by the equation@xmath90which results from the eigenmodes determined in the linearized system ( the dispersion relation already shows this characteristic scales ) . here",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are typical wavelength and time scales of the chaplygin instability on @xmath2 .",
    "let us take @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "then@xmath98now we estimate the distance between the centres of two neighbor rolls , taking the pattern consisting of @xmath99 convective rolls with their centres at @xmath100 , for a minor radius @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "then the time scale is@xmath103which is very fast .",
    "moreover , this time scale is compatible with the time scale determined independently from the flow of the hot streamer , since from eq.([eq109 ] ) we also obtain @xmath104 .",
    "the peripheric velocity of the convection rolls is transferred to plasma at larger @xmath7 both by reynolds stress and by collisional drag . on the other hand even the geometry of the flow around closed rolls leads to a continuous ( but wavy ) streamlines which can represent a continuous poloidal flow .",
    "we want to show how to obtain the envelope representing the connected poloidal flow arising from separated rolls having rotations in the same direction .",
    "therefore we will restrict the treatment to the pure geometric properties of the ideal flow .",
    "the reynolds stress and collisions will enhance the efficiency of producing a directed poloidal flow .",
    "the treatment is based on complex formalism @xcite for the plane flow .",
    "we consider the _ fluid _ in the complex @xmath29 plane with a set of vortices placed at different positions .",
    "we need the _ complex potential _ of the flow in the @xmath29 plane , @xmath105 .",
    "the problem is not solved directly in the physical plane of the flow but in a plane @xmath106 connected with @xmath29 by a _",
    "conformal transformation_. the idea is to take in the @xmath107-plane a structure which is standard ( _ canonical _ ) .",
    "it consists of ( 1 ) the circle with the center in @xmath108 and unit radius @xmath109 and ( 2 ) a set of @xmath110 circles with centres @xmath111 and radii @xmath112 placed inside the circle @xmath113 .    by the _ conformal map _ @xmath114",
    "this corresponds to @xmath115 fixed circular obstacles in the @xmath29 plane of the physical flow .",
    "our rolls of convection are patches of rotating fluid for which it is only specified the _ circulation _ of the fluid around ( _ i.e. _ the integral of the tangential velocity on the closed contour ) @xmath116 .",
    "the fluid moves in the @xmath29 plane with the condition of keeping the given value @xmath117 of the circulation at every circle @xmath118 .",
    "this does not uniquely specify the flow .",
    "one needs the condition at infinity , far from the regions where the circular vortices are given .    after defining the geometry it is possible to construct the _ complex potential _ in the @xmath106 plane .",

    "the circulation around each vortex roll is @xmath130 .    in the plane @xmath106",

    "this _ complex potential _ is in @xmath106 plane and from here it must be carried back onto the physical ( @xmath29 ) plane , by a _ conformal transformation _ which requires numerical calculation .",
    "the resulting flow have streamlines that show formation of poloidal rotation as we depart progressively from the line where the centers of the vortices are located @xcite .",
    "since this is a gemetrical property it means that the poloidal flow occurs simultaneously with the onset of convection rolls , _",
    "i.e. _ on a very fast time scale .",
    "the high density and temperature gradients ( or both ) , supported by external sources , lead to formation of large scale cells of convection . due to the background neoclassical rotation the rolls have all the same direction of rotation .",
    "the baroclinic term induces high peripheric velocities in the rolls and the envelope of these peripheric flows is a poloidal rotation .",
    "the rise of the poloidal velocity takes place on the same time scale as the onset of the convection rolls and this is governed by the baroclinic term acting on the initial hot stream .",
    "it is a fast process , similar to the onset of convection in the classical rayleigh - benard system .",
    "one important aspect should be underlined : the flow in the convection rolls ( hence the poloidal rotation ) is sustained by the gradients of the equilibrium temperature and/or the equilibrium density , which in turn are sustained by external sources .",
    "therefore the flow in the rolls of convection ( implicitely the induced poloidal velocity ) is sustained by external sources .",
    "this completely changes the usual picture on the poloidal rotation , the damping due to the magnetic pumping is now balanced and overcommed by the external sources .",
    "this also suggests the existence of a threshold , which will be examined in a separate work .",
    "the dynamics in the radial direction consists of charge separation and has weak effect on the force balance along this direction .",
    "we consider the approximate radial equilibrium of forces@xmath150as valid over the interval of time increase of @xmath4 . in appendix c",
    "we argue that the fast change of @xmath4 is mainly reflected in a change of the radial electric field @xmath3 , on the same time scale , leading to the approximative balance@xmath151 since we have@xmath152it results that the time change of the radial electric field will modify the motion of the bananas .",
    "we are in the regime described by hinton and robertson @xcite where during the motion of the particle on the banana orbit there is effective change of the radial electric field which acts on the particle . in the ref.@xcite",
    "the effect is found to be manifested in two ways .",
    "first , there is a steady radial motion of the bananas .",
    "second , in each bounce period , there is an acceleration of the motion in the toroidal direction .",
    "the effects are due to the fact that ( schematically ) the particle feels a certain radial electric field on half of its orbit and a different radial electric field when it returns along the second half of the orbit .",
    "the main assumption that has led us to this estimation is that@xmath153_i.e . _",
    "the baroclinic term acts all around the circular path of the rolled up flow in the cell and accelerates the rotation .",
    "the time scale is given by the time of rotation in the cell.@xmath154    the time variation of the poloidal velocity is the time of acceleration@xmath155and the time derivative of the radial electric field is@xmath156    at every bounce the banana gets a toroidal acceleration hintonrobertson@xmath157where@xmath158@xmath159this kick of acceleration , leading to the change of the toroidal velocity of the trapped particle @xmath160 is due to the variation of the radial electric field during the time interval the trapped ion makes a complete bounce .",
    "the number of bounces that a trapped particle makes in an interval of time @xmath161 is@xmath162during the time interval @xmath161 the total change of the toroidal velocity of a trapped particle is@xmath163this change is substantial . on a time interval of one millisecond @xmath164 , with @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and taking as before @xmath168 , @xmath44 the change of the toroidal velocity of a single trapped particle is of the order of the thermal velocity . when the initial toroidal flow is opposite to this acceleration",
    "there is reversal of rotation .",
    "the energy requested for this change is provided , in our model , by the equilibrium gradients of temperature and density .",
    "there are other mechanisms that can sustain or modify the spontaneous toroidal rotation .",
    "the drift wave turbulence creates a statistical ensemble of fluctuating velocities and the coupling of the radial and poloidal components can have a non - zero correlation ( reynolds stress ) with spatial dependence .",
    "the divergence of this correlation is a driving force for the rotation . due to the long correlation length in the toroidal direction ,",
    "the reynolds stress is efficient in the poloidal plane and in particular is able to induce zonal flows .",
    "if it overcomes the magnetic damping it can induce poloidal rotation and so generate a non - vanishing @xmath169 and the subsequent neoclassical polarization .",
    "the latter modifies the toroidal precession , _",
    "i.e. _ the plasma toroidal rotation",
    ". a detailed analysis of this connection should be made , with focus on transitory processes , as observed in alcator c - mode @xcite .",
    "however few aspects can be discussed qualitatively . since it is based on a statistical ensemblethe reynolds stress",
    "needs a strong poloidal - symmetry breaking mechanism otherwise the average is zero .",
    "indeed the symmetry breaking can exist , analogous to the flows arising in the rayleigh - benard experiments after higher order bifurcations ( flows are called  `` winds '' ) .",
    "however their manifestation is slower that all the other time scales : conduction , convection .",
    "it is difficult to see how the onset of a poloidal flow via only reynolds stress can take place on time scales less than milliseconds , if the background consists of random drift waves .",
    "on the other hand it is well established that large scale convective flows have much higher reynolds stress than the @xmath170 quasi - isotropic turbulence .",
    "this is partly the reason for the present investigation , where we precede any effect of change of the rotation by the onset of a chain of convection cells .",
    "we further note one aspect that results from the combined effect of convective cells and the stringer drive and compare it with the reynolds stress .",
    "a chain of convective cells ( with either unidirectional or alternating vorticity direction ) induces a periodic modulation of the local rate of transport .",
    "the neoclassical stringer effect converts this modulation into an effective poloidal torque , possibly higher than the damping due to magnetic pumping . in a similar case but in the absence of convection cells",
    "mccarthyhassam * * , * * the ratio of the magnitude of the reynolds stress over the stringer drive was found small .",
    "the presence of convective cells enhances both the reynolds stress and the stringer drive .",
    "further study is necessary for a correct comparison of magnitudes .",
    "we have proposed a phenomenological model for the reversal of the toroidal rotation in tokamak .",
    "the model assembles effects that separately are known to appear in tokamak plasma and have been studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the generation of convection structures with flows that are quasi - coherent on large scales in the meridional section is in general admitted as a particularly effective way of transport of angular momentum and of energy across the magnetic field .",
    "we consider the situation of cells of convection with the same sense of rotation flow , disposed around the magnetic axis in the region extending from the core plasma to the confining zone , a structure that is compatible with the basic neoclassical flow .",
    "it is also inspired by atmospheric and protoplanetary flows where such distribution occurs in hydrodynamic regimes very similar to the one in tokamak .",
    "the convection is sustained by equilibrium gradients of density and temperature ( which in turn are fed by external sources ) and this drives the poloidal velocity which is generated by the combined , unidirectional , peripheric flows of the cells .",
    "then the decay due to parallel viscosity ( magnetic pumping ) can be overcomed .",
    "the time scales are short due to the baroclinic term which accounts for the generation of vorticity .",
    "the fast increase of the poloidal velocity induces a fast variation of the radial electric field , on a time scale that is comparable with the bounce time .",
    "on part of the banana trajectory the ions see a magnitude of the radial electric field and on rest of the trajectory they see a different magnitude .",
    "this produces both radial motion and the change of velocity in toroidal direction .",
    "the collisions will spread this drive to the rest of the ion population .",
    "the principal merits of this theoretical explanation is that it provides a connection between poloidal and toroidal rotation .",
    "usually the direction of influence is reversed and based of instabilities : the sheared parallel flow induces instabilities whose turbulent reynolds stress acts to generate and sustain the poloidal rotation against the magnetic pumping decay donghorton , @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is active in situation where the turbulence is known to induce poloidal flows acting as internal transport barriers , while the basic flow is observed to be toroidal .",
    "it can interfere with the generation of convective structures , for example in formation of goertler vortices @xcite , etc . in the present case",
    "the poloidal flow is a geometric consequence of the flow in the convection structures .",
    "the driving effect of the poloidal flow on the toroidal flow has a fast transient phase which is decissive since it involves neoclassical polarization on the time scale of the bounce on bananas .",
    "the different components of this phenomenology appear to be compatible and to combine in a structure which is logically coherent .",

    "the problem consists of calculation of the radial polarization current when the poloidal velocity is strongly forced .",
