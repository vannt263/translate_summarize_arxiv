    "non - magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period binaries in which a late - type , roche - lobe - filling main - sequence dwarf transfers gas onto a rotating , accretion - heated white dwarf ( wd ) . in a non - magnetic system",
    ", the white dwarf does not have a magnetic field strong enough to prevent the formation of an accretion disk .",
    "hence , the gas carrying angular momentum is expected to accrete preferentially onto the equatorial latitudes of the white dwarf and spread rapidly with latitude @xcite . for accretion rates below a critical threshold when the accretion flow would be so high ( hot ) that the accretion disk would become fully ionized @xcite .",
    "this critical threshold @xcite is given by    mcrit@xmath10 g / s .",
    "for a dwarf nova , a thermal - viscous instability in the disk leads to repetitive ( limit cycle - like ) disk accretion events in which gravitational energy is released ( the dwarf nova outburst ) in a few days followed by weeks to months of lower level accretion ( dwarf nova quiescence ) before the disk builds up to trigger the next outburst .",
    "if a cataclysmic variable white dwarf accretes enough envelope mass , then every few thousand years to tens of thousands of years ( depending upon the white dwarf mass and average accretion rate ) , a thermonuclear explosion occurs in the white dwarf s accreted envelope which is identified as the classical nova outburst .",
    "however , there is a subclass of cvs , known as the nova - like variables , in which the mass - transfer rate tends to be higher and the light of the system is typically dominated by a very bright accretion disk ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the spectra of nova - like variables generally resemble those of classical novae ( cne ) that have settled back to quiescence . yet",
    "the nova - like variables have never had a recorded cn outburst , dwarf nova outburst or any outburst .",
    "hence their evolutionary status is still unclear",
    ". they could be close to having their next cn explosion , or they may have had an unrecorded explosion , in the recent past .",
    "their distribution of orbital periods covers a broad range above the upper boundary of the cv period gap . within the cv period gap between orbital periods of two and three hours , very few cvs",
    "are found .",
    "the nova - like variables comprise a number of subgroups with differing photometric and spectroscopic behavior .",
    "the various subclasses of nova - like variables are defined in @xcite .",
    "some nova - likes ( classified as the vy sculptoris systems ) exhibit the behavior of being in a high optical brightness state for most of the time , but unpredictably plummet into a deep low optical brightness state with little or no ongoing accretion .",
    "then , just as unpredictably , their optical brightness returns to the high state ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these precipitous drops in brightness are possibly related to the cessation of mass transfer from the k - m dwarf secondary star either by starspots that drift into position under the inner lagrangian point , l1 @xcite or irradiation feedback in which an inflated outer disk can modulate the mass transfer from the secondary by blocking its irradiation by the hot inner accretion disk region @xcite .",
    "other nova - like systems , the ux uma subclass , do not appear to exhibit low states but remain in a state of high accretion , sometimes referred to as dwarf novae stuck in permanent outburst ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "it is widely assumed that the absence of dwarf novae outbursts in nova - likes is explained by their mass transfer rates being above the critical threshold where accretion rates are so high that the accretion disk is largely ionized , thus suppressing the viscous - thermal instability ( the disk instability mechanism or dim ) which drives dwarf nova limit cycles @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years , a number of authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) have presented evidence questioning the validity of the disk instability mechanism .",
    "still another nova - like subclass , this one spectroscopically - defined , is the sw sextantis stars , which display a multitude of observational characteristics : orbital periods between 3 and 4 hours , one third of the systems non - eclipsing and two - thirds showing deep eclipses of the wd by the secondary , single - peaked emission lines despite the high inclination , and high excitation spectral features including he ii ( 4686 ) emission and strong balmer emission on a blue continuum , high velocity emission s - waves with maximum blueshift near phase @xmath11 , delay of emission line radial velocities relative to the motion of the wd , and central absorption dips in the emission lines around phase @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the white dwarfs in many , if not all , of these systems are suspected of being magnetic @xcite . since these objects are found near the upper boundary of the period gap , their study is of critical importance to understanding cv evolution as they enter the period gap @xcite .",
    "the time - averaged accretion rates of all subtypes of nova - like variables must be known in order to understand their secular evolution and to compare their accretion rates with each other and with the various classes of dwarf novae .",
    "these will in turn shed light on the evolutionary properties , including the possible relation to supersoft sources and type ia supernovae . in this paper , we use synthetic spectra of accretion disks and white dwarf photospheres to carry out analyses of the previously unmodeled far ultraviolet spectra of seven nova - like variables with a special focus on determining their accretion rates .",
    "two of the best - observed nova - likes , kr aur and rw tri , each have relatively good quality fuv coverage .",
    "rw tri in particular also has an accurate trigonometric parallax .",
    "these two objects together with v825 her , v795 her , bp lyn , v425 cas and hl aqr represent three different subclasses of nova - like systems .",
    "four of the systems , bp lyn , v795 her , hl aqr and rw tri , are also classified as sw sextantis systems , while hl aqr and rw tri are also classified as ux uma systems .",
    "two of the nova - like systems , kr aur and v425 cas , are classified as vy sculptoris systems .",
    "we briefly describe their presently known overall properties .",
    "this nova - like system is classified as a vy scl subtype with high states at magnitude 12.7 and the deepest low state being 17.9 ( @xcite , edition 7.12 ) .",
    "the system underwent a deep minimum during 1994 - 95 when optical spectra revealed emission lines possibly indicative of a disk still being present @xcite .",
    "the minimum lasted eight months .",
    "however , usually the system brightness is magnitude 12 to 14 with 13.5 being the most typical brightness .",
    "kr aur is one of six out of 23 vy scl nova - likes which have negative superhumps .",
    "negative superhumps may arise when a disk becomes tilted due to intense radiation from a very hot white dwarf and thus could be an indirect indicator of nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "the other systems with negative superhumps are v442 oph , dw uma , tt ari and v751 cyg .",
    "the orbital inclination is low with an upper limit of 38 degrees and a lower limit of 10 degrees @xcite .",
    "the orbital period is 0.1628 days .",
    "the white dwarf masss has been estimated to be in the range of 0.59 to 0.17 m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this very bright eclipsing nova - like variable ( @xmath13 ) is classified as both an sw sex star and a ux uma system since it never been observed to go into a low brightness state .",
    "it has an accurate hubble fgs trigonometric parallax of @xmath14 $ ] pc @xcite , and a moderately high orbital inclination of @xmath15 degrees @xcite .",
    "the component masses given in ( @xcite ; update 7.12 ) are m@xmath16 m@xmath1 and a secondary mass of @xmath17 m@xmath1 while poole et al.(2003 ) found m@xmath18 m@xmath1 and m@xmath19 m@xmath1 .",
    "this thick disk object , discovered as pg 1717 + 413 , is a luminous , nova - like cv classified as a ux uma - type nova - like variable @xcite , as though it were a dwarf nova stuck in outburst continuously .",
    "there is no evidence of coherent optical pulsations expected for a magnetic accretor and only very weak he ii , whereas he ii is typically strong in magnetic cvs .",
    "no physical parameters were previously determined for v825 her @xcite .",
    "its white dwarf mass , orbital inclination and accretion rate are unknown . @xcite reported no spectroscopic trace of the secondary star in their optical spectra thus suggesting relatively high luminosity and mass transfer rate .",
    "v795 her is an sw sex - subtype nova - like variable @xcite which has an uncertain classification as an intermediate polar ( it shows a coherent x - ray period which could be from a non - synchronously spinning , magnetized white dwarf and is a strong x - ray source ) .",
    "it exhibits a highly variable line spectrum with a periodicity seen in iue spectra ( 4.8 hours ) that was mistakenly identified with its orbital period and a continuum steeply rising toward short wavelengths .",
    "the correct orbital period appears to be 2.6 hours .",
    "@xcite found the 2.6 hour orbital signature in the uv lines detected on hst fos time series spectra . nevertheless , there is still some uncertainty associated with the origin of both detected periodicities .",
    "no eclipses have been observed .",
    "there is possibly a p cygni profile at c iv .",
    "bp lyn ( pg0859 + 4150 ) is a low inclination sw sex - type nova - like variable where the white dwarf primary is not eclipsed by the secondary star ( hoard & szkody 1996 ) .",
    "there is a shallow v - shaped eclipse suggesting an eclipse of a hot spot in the system around 0.9 phase .",
    "there are high excitation emission lines and the high balmer lines have broad absorption wings , characteristic of an optically thick accretion disk .",
    "the h - alpha emission line radial velocity lags the expected position for the location of the accretion disk at phase 0.4 - 0.5 .",
    "most of the radiation appears to emanate from the opposite side of the disk from the hot spot location .",
    "@xcite invoke an enhanced thickness line absorption region at the edge of the disk at phases 0.6 to 0.9 .",
    "v425 cas is a vy scl - type nova - like variable viewed at low inclination @xcite .",
    "its fuv flux level and absence of p cygni profiles indicate that v425 cas was in an intermediate brightness state when it was observed with the iue telescope @xcite .",
    "the iue fes optical magnitude at the time of the iue observation ( see below ) was @xmath20 while in its deepest low state v425 cas has @xmath21 , thus confirming the intermediate state .",
    "kato ( 2001 ) discovered large amplitude oscillations with a 2.65 day period which they attribute to suppression of a disk instability by irradiation .",
    "if the variation were really due to a dwarf nova type instability , then this object could be transitional between a vy scl system and an ultra - short outburst period dwarf nova .",
    "if that were the case , this would be the shortest recurrence time for dwarf nova outbursts ever seen in an h - rich cv citephunger85 .",
    "hl aqr ( phl227 ) is a ux uma - type nova - like variable @xcite with a highly variable optical spectrum and is also classified as a sw sextantis member .",
    "it has a reddening value @xmath22 , but the white dwarf mass and accretion rate are unknown .",
    "@xcite estimate that hl aqr has an orbital inclination in the range @xmath23 , which is much lower than that of the emission - dominated , non - eclipsing sw sex stars ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility of many low - inclination nova - likes actually being sw sex stars , but with a very different spectroscopic appearance as they show significant absorption rather than being emission line - dominated @xcite .",
    "hl aqr is a virtual spectroscopic twin of v3885 sgr ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it shows pronounced irregular variations and coherent rapid oscillations with a period of 19.6 s.    in order to constrain the synthetic spectral fitting and try to reduce the number of free parameters , we carried out a thorough search of the published literature for the most accurately known system parameters .",
    "this included the compilations in @xcite and the goettingen cv cat website as well as publications documented in the astrophysics data service .",
    "the most critical parameter for the model fitting , the distance , is one of the least known .",
    "unlike dwarf novae which reveal a correlation between their absolute magnitude at maximum and their orbital period , there is no such relation for the nova - likes .",
    "however , a new method @xcite utilizing 2mass jhk photometry and the observed properties of cv donor stars has proven useful for constraining nova - like distances . at present , this is the only reliable handle one has on nova - like distances although caution should be exercised because for some nova - like systems ( e.g. tt ari ) , the method appears to break down . for each system",

    "( 2007 ) who applied a multi - parametric optimization fitting method to kr aur .",
    "they explored a range of white dwarf masses 0.4 to 0.8 m@xmath1 , inclinations @xmath84 and an adopted patterson ( 1984 ) distance of @xmath85 pc .",
    "they found an accretion rate m@xmath86 m@xmath1/yr which is atypically low for a vy scl nova - like variable in its high state .",
    "moreover , puebla et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that kr aur should have a significant flux contribution of a hot white dwarf in addition to an accretion disk .",
    "our results are not inconsistent with their reported analysis .",
    "further , the distance implied by our best - fitting model solution is similar to the patterson ( 1984 ) distance used by @xcite .",
    "thus , kr aur represents a second case ( tt ari being the other ) of a a nova - like variable whose distance using knigge s method yields a large disagreement with existing distance estimates from other methods . taking the temperature of the white dwarf indicated by our solution at face value , then the white dwarf temperature ( 29,000k ) would be cooler than other white dwarfs of known temperature in vy scl systems .",
    "for example , the white dwarf in tt ari has t@xmath87k , in mv lyra 47,000k and in dw uma , 49,000k .",
    "it is unfortunate that a fuse spectrum of kr aur was not obtained since this would provided a definitive check on the white dwarf temperature .",
    "our analysis of seven archival iue spectra of the sw sex - type nova - like rw tri using its parallax distance consistently yields a low mass ( @xmath88m@xmath1 ) white dwarf and an average accretion rate , m@xmath89 m@xmath1/yr . on the other hand , @xcite , using their statistical fitting solution , constrained the white dwarf mass to be in the range 0.4 to 0.8 m@xmath1 , and the inclination angle between 60 and 80 degrees for the fixed distance of 340 pc .",
    "our modeling strongly favors a low mass white dwarf ( m@xmath90 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "our low white dwarf mass also favors the low end of the most likely mass range ( 0.4 to 0.7 m@xmath1 ) estimated by @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our accretion rate with other derived accretion rates for rw tri reveals it is lower than the value @xmath67m@xmath1/yr determined by @xcite but agrees with the accretion rate of @xmath91m@xmath1/yr derived independently by @xcite .",
    "however , our accretion rate is a factor of two larger than the accretion rate published by @xcite from eclipse mapping and a factor of ten smaller than the accretion rate of @xcite , also derived from eclipse mapping .",
    "our model analysis of the ux uma system v825 her reveals an accretion rate of @xmath64m@xmath1/yr with a low inclination angle ( 18 degrees ) and a low white dwarf mass ( m@xmath92 m@xmath1 ) . for ux uma systems which are stuck in permanent outburst ,",
    "this high accretion rate is not unreasonable . likewise for hl",
    "aqr , another ux uma systems , our best fit model indicates a low mass white dwarf , a low inclination angle but with an accretion rate @xmath93m@xmath1/yr , a factor of 3 lower than v825 her .",
    "since hl aqr is considered a spectroscopic twin of v3885 sgr , we note that a likely fuse + hst stis detection of the hot accreting white dwarf with t@xmath94k in the ux uma system , v3885 sgr , by @xcite raises the possibility of an object with similar surface temperature being present in the ux uma system hl aqr .    for bp lyn",
    "we find a high accretion m@xmath8m@xmath1/yr .",
    "@xcite commented that the continuum slope is consistent with that of an accretion disk - only although no detailed accretion disk model with vertical structure was applied to the data .",
    "it is clear from @xcite that bp lyn is a bona fide sw sex member and appears to be a low inclination analog of rw tri @xcite .    finally , for v425 cas , based upon a single iue spectrum of this vy scl system taken during an intermediate brightness state , we find that an accretion disk dominates its far uv spectrum but with a non - negligible contribution from a hot white dwarf",
    ". our derived accretion rate of m@xmath95m@xmath1/yr is lower than typical accretion rates of nova - likes during high brightness states which appears consistent with v425 cas being in an intermediate brightness state .",
    "szkody ( 1990 ) using @xcite models found m@xmath96m@xmath1/yr while the @xcite p@xmath72 versus m relation yields @xmath97m@xmath1/yr . using the h@xmath74 equivalent widths and patterson s relation , m@xmath75 m@xmath1/yr ,",
    "this is in agreement with our fuv - derived value .",
    "@xcite applied multi - component modeling to the archival fuv spectra of nova - like variables that are members of the sw sextantis subclass and those which are not classified as members .",
    "they found no difference between the average derived accretion rates of sw sex members and non - sw sex members .",
    "the present study adds the modeling of seven nova - like systems to the sample of 15 nova - like systems analyzed by @xcite , 23 nova - likes analyzed by @xcite , and three nova - likes analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the nova - like systems in the present study represent a mix of different subclasses ( ux uma - type , vy scl - type and sw sex - type ) whose archival fuv spectra have been compared , typically for the first time , with reasonably realistic models of accretion disks and photospheres .",
    "all but one had fuv spectra taken in their high brightness states .",
    "the accretion rates we have derived in this paper are only as good as the distances we have adopted .",
    "the method of @xcite represents the best handle we presently have on the distances to nova - like variables .",
    "since any derived accretion rates depend very sensitively upon distance , precision trigonometric parallaxes from the ground and from space ( e.g. gaia ) are required to determine the most accurate accretion rates for the different subtypes of nova - like variables . in the meantime ,",
    "more nova - like parallaxes are needed from the ground and with the fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) on hst .",
