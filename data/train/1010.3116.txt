    "the framework developed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to deal with quantum field theories defined on manifolds with boundary arise naturally from a much more physical point of view .",
    "we will go further than this by applying a similar line of reasoning ( technically more involved ) to the analysis of sine - gordon kink quantum fluctuations up to the one - loop level , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite to find different descriptions of this phenomenon but both akin to the framework of this paper .",
    "it is convenient to point out that in this later kind of problems ( kink fluctuations ) normal ordering is not enough to achieve ultraviolet renormalization but mass renormalization graphs must be taken into account . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will not address this issue in this paper .",
    "we have chosen this theme to celebrate m. gadella 60th birthday because manolo became a master in the study of this type of systems , see @xcite-@xcite , in his long quest for understanding the very subtle nature of quantum resonances .",
    "the fluctuations of 1d free scalar fields on static classical backgrounds are governed by the following quadratic lagrangian in the fields : @xmath2    we assume classical backgrounds as given by the function ( or generalized function ) @xmath3 that tend to zero at the two boundary points @xmath4 of the spatial line enclosing a finite area   could also be interpreted as a variable square mass of the free quanta . ] .",
    "the fourier components of the field @xmath5 satisfy the sch@xmath1dinger equation : @xmath6 such that the fluctuating normal modes are the solutions of the spectral problem ( [ scfluc ] ) .",
    "in general there will be scattering solutions as well as bound states in this problem . assuming that @xmath7 is definite positive -@xmath8 modes",
    "do not contribute and @xmath9 modes are tachyonic- the uncertainty principle dictates that the contribution of these quantum fluctuations to the energy of the vacuum is of the form : @xmath10 \\qquad , \\label{vacen}\\ ] ] the sum of the bound state energies plus the integral due to the continuous part of the spectrum .",
    "we shall use throughout the paper the natural system of units where the planck constant is equal to @xmath11 and the speed of light is one : @xmath12 .    even if the infrared divergences were tamed by choosing a very long normalization length @xmath13",
    ", ultraviolet divergences enter the game due to the infinite number of fluctuating modes .",
    "we subtract the contribution of the modes in absence of the background encoded in the spectral density of the problem ( [ scfluc ] ) when the potential is zero , @xmath14 , in order to cope with very energetic modes that do not feel the background .",
    "thus , the spectral density measured with respect to the spectral density of the zero background case is given in terms of the derivative of the phase shifts with respect to the momentum : @xmath15   \\ , \\ , .\\ ] ]      it has been suggested in the literature @xcite-@xcite-@xcite that the casimir effect between perfect conducting plates can be explained in this framework by considering a background given by two dirac @xmath0 functions . in the interesting paper @xcite by bordag and collaborators , for instance ,",
    "the quantum vacuum interaction between two identical delta walls is studied for the cases of scalar and spinor fluctuations .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath17 mimics two homogeneous plates located at the points @xmath18 with different penetrability related to the different wall strengths @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in order to use non - dimensional coordinates and coupling constants we perform the re - scalings : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an small mass and @xmath23 works as an infrared cutoff . note that the lagrangian density scales as @xmath24 .",
    "the spectral problem that comes out from the dimensionless lagrangian density @xmath25\\phi_\\omega(x)=\\omega^2\\phi_\\omega(x ) \\label{delta}\\ ] ] and it is expressed in terms of non - dimensional fields , coordinates , coupling constants and @xmath0 functions will be solved in the next section .",
    "another physical phenomenon related to 1d scattering processes is the surge of quantum fluctuations over classical kinks , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on the sine - gordon model where the dynamics is determined by the lagrangian density @xmath26 following @xcite we re - define fields , coordinates , and parameters to deal with non - dimensional quantities : @xmath27 ; @xmath28 ; @xmath29 . the lagrangian density scales as @xmath30 , where the non dimensional counterpart is @xmath31 and the static configuration @xmath32 is the famous stable kink solution of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "the shift from the kink field @xmath33 shows the lagrangian for the higgs \" boson field @xmath34 in the solitonic background : @xmath35 the small kink fluctuations , however , are ruled by a lagrangian quadratic in the field , i.e. , by keeping only the @xmath36 term in the expansions above : @xmath37 the fourier modes satisfy now the schr@xmath1dinger equation @xmath38\\phi_\\omega(x)=\\omega^2\\phi_\\omega(x ) \\label{spt}\\ ] ] although the energy of the kink fluctuations is given by one formula like the formula of the vacuum energy only at the one - loop level .",
    "moreover , because there are many vertices in the lagrangian it will be necessary normal ordering the hamiltonian to control all the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we shall also add two @xmath0-walls to take into account the effect of both one external -the two @xmath39- and one solitonic background -the p@xmath1sch - teller potential- mixed together .",
    "therefore , a new , interesting , scattering problem will be studied .",
    "we finish this section by showing the meson green function in the kink background calculated according to standard techniques in qft @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the first - order jacobi polynomial in @xmath42 .",
    "we start this section by stating the following caveat : even though the one - particle scattering over attractive @xmath0 s is a well defined quantum mechanical problem , the associated @xmath43-dimensional quantum field theory suffer from pathologies .",
    "the qft model is non unitary when the quantum fluctuation operator is non positive , i. e. , when bound states of negative energy appear in the spectrum of the one - particle hamiltonian operator .",
    "nevertheless , absorbent plates and/or creation / anihilation of particles can be modeled by @xmath0 wells and , thus , we shall not completely rule out attractive @xmath0 potentials .",
    "we choose the potential in the form : @xmath44 . to build scattering wave functions we divide the real line in three zones :    @xmath45    the `` diestro '' ( righthanded ) - particles incoming from the left- scattering wave functions are of the form : @xmath46 clearly , the functions above are eigen - functions of the schr@xmath1dinger operator in each zone . in order to become solutions in the whole real line , they must be sewed by demanding continuity of the wave function @xmath47 and setting the finite step discontinuity of @xmath48 at the points @xmath18 : @xmath49 these four equations are sufficient to fix the transmission and reflection amplitudes ( `` diestras '' ) , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , as well as the amplitudes of the wave functions @xmath52 , @xmath53 between the walls / wells : @xmath54    for particles coming from the right the zurdo \" ( lefthanded ) scattering wave functions have the form : @xmath55 arguing exactly in the same way as in the diestro scattering we find the transmission and reflection amplitudes ( zurdas  ) as well as the intertwining amplitudes : @xmath56    from these data we obtain the 2 @xmath0 scattering matrix : @xmath57=\\left ( \\begin{array}{cc }   \\sigma _ r & \\rho _ l \\\\   \\rho _ r & \\sigma _",
    "l \\end{array } \\right)$ ] .",
    "the phase shifts , the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix , and the spectral density are consequently defined in the form : @xmath58 note that , due to the invariance of the schr@xmath59dinger equation under time inversion , @xmath60 , whereas @xmath61 only for @xmath62 invariant ( even ) potentials .",
    "we now consider the double @xmath63 and @xmath64 limit",
    ". for arbitrary values of the momentum only the reflection amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath65 are non zero because the @xmath0-barriers become completely opaque .",
    "there are , however , values of @xmath66 such that @xmath61 is singular and @xmath67 , @xmath68 are non null but finite .",
    "these momenta arise in a situation where the zones ii and iii are completely disconnected between them and from the zone i. this is no one scattering scenario , rather , the waves remain confined in the finite interval @xmath69 $ ] subjected to some boundary conditions to be specified .",
    "when @xmath66 takes the special values mentioned above , the quantum mechanical system that arises in zone i is a consistent system in the sense of @xcite . in this case",
    "the laplace - beltrami operator restricted to zone i is self - adjoint , and the hamiltonian unitary . because in this limit the hamiltonian is definite positive , a unitary quantum field theory can be constructed in the zone i bounded region @xcite .",
    "necessary conditions for having consistent quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical systems in zone i are encoded in the boundary behaviour of the wave functions .    in order to do that",
    ", we denote @xmath70 @xmath71 is , up to a phase and a factor of 2 , the spectral function for dirichlet boundary conditions derived in @xcite within the framework of the @xcite formalism to construct unitary quantum field theories in manifolds with boundary ( see also the references @xcite where this point of view is further developed ) .",
    "in fact , the zeroes of @xmath72 @xmath73 are the only values of the momentum for which the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 amplitudes do not go to zero in the @xmath76 limit but they become : @xmath77 for these allowed momentum values the zone i wave functions take the form @xmath78 in the ultra - strong limit , collapsing the diestro `` and zurdo '' solutions in a single solution that we denote as @xmath79 .",
    "there are two possibilities :    * if n is even , the wave function is : @xmath80 because @xmath81 only the even positive integers , @xmath82 , provide linearly independent wave functions .",

    "the scattering solutions are build in the same form as in the previous section but one must replace plane waves by plane waves times first - order jacobi polynomials ( solutions of the p@xmath1sch - teller spectral problem ) in the zone i : @xmath101 identical continuity / discontinuity conditions at @xmath18 as before provide the ( diestras  ) transmission and reflection amplitudes as well as the amplitudes of the wave functions @xmath52 , @xmath53 in zone i : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and we have used the abbreviations : @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
