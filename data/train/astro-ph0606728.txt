    "m33 , the triangulum galaxy ( @xmath8 ) , is the third brightest local group galaxy , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath9 .",
    "it is a late - type spiral , sc ii - iii , with two open spiral arms and no clear evidence of any bulge component ( @xcite ) .",
    "the overwhelming majority of light in m33 is distributed in an exponential disk component ( @xcite ) , and the optical disk is tilted at nearly @xmath10 to the strongly warped hi envelope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of its nucleus is small ( @xmath11 ) , ruling out the presence of a supermassive black hole ( @xcite ) like that implied to exist in the milky way ( mw ; @xcite ) and m31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite analyse the kinematics of stars clusters in m33 , and find two distinct kinematic populations , which they argue represent a disk and halo population , although individual stars belonging to a halo component in m33 had not been directly observed . in a companion paper by a. ferguson et al .",
    "_ in preparation _",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we present our wide field photometry of this galaxy taken with the isaac newton telescope wide field camera ( int  wfc ) , and show that a low level stellar component dominates the radial profile of m33 at large radius , implying the presence of an extended stellar halo in m33 . unlike its massive neighbor , m31 , there is no evidence of substructure in m33 to a surface brightness threshold of @xmath12magssq.arcsec .    in this _ letter _ , we present first results from a spectroscopic survey of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars in m33 using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ) on keck  ii ( @xcite ) .",
    "section  2 describes our observations .",
    "section 3 analyzes the radial velocity distributions in our fields .",
    "section 4 analyzes the metallicities of our target stars , and section 5 discusses our results and concludes .",
    "we assume a distance to m33 of @xmath13kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "since 2002 , our group has been conducting a spectroscopic survey of m31 using deimos on keck  ii ( @xcite ) . in september ",
    "october 2005 , we extended the scope of this survey to m33 .",
    "the two fields analyzed here were taken at the end of the night at high airmass , during imperfect weather conditions .",
    "their location relative to the disk of m33 can be seen in figure  [ rotcurve ] , and are positioned @xmath14 ( 9kpc ) along the southern major axis to study the kinematics of stars at the edge of the m33 disk . in the same way as our m31 study , we used the ` mini - slitlet ' deimos setup for these fields , which significantly increases the multipexing capabilites of this instrument ( @xcite ) .",
    "targets were selected from the int survey using a color  magnitude box defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "other targets brighter than @xmath17 were automatically chosen to fill in the available space of the spectrograph detector .",
    "the contours in figure  [ rotcurve ] show the expected mean stellar heliocentric radial velocities for a kinematic model of m33 , based upon the hi rotation curve of m33 derived by @xcite and shown in her figure  5 .",
    "we assume a stellar distribution in m33 described by @xmath18 , with @xmath19 ( 1.4kpc ; @xcite ) and @xmath20kpc .",
    "changing @xmath21 within the range @xmath22$]kpc makes no significant difference to any of our results .",
    "stars occupy circular orbits with @xmath23 and @xmath24 defined by interpolation of the hi rotation curve , linearly extrapolated beyond @xmath25 ( 18kpc ) where necessary .",
    "the model is then corrected for the position angle ( @xmath26 ) and inclination ( @xmath27 ) of the stellar disk of m33 .",
    "the mean velocity along any sight - line through the disk is calculated as @xmath28 , and corrected to the heliocentric frame .",
    "@xmath29 is a unit vector pointing along the direction of our line of sight .",
    "the data were processed and reduced in the same way as the main m31 survey ( @xcite ) . due to the generally poor observing conditions , the data analyzed here consist of @xmath30stars with a cross correlation coefficient @xmath31 , a signal - to - noise ( @xmath32 ) in the continuum @xmath33 , a tonry - davis coefficient ( @xcite ) @xmath33 , and a velocity error @xmath34kms@xmath1 ( @xmath35kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ 3fields ] shows the heliocentric radial velocity ( @xmath36 ) distributions in our two fields .",
    "the dashed lines indicate @xmath37 , and the dot - dashed lines indicate the systemic velocity of m33 , @xmath38kms@xmath1 .",
    "the dot - dashed histograms show the expected heliocentric velocity distributions of the mw stars that lie in each field using the mw model of @xcite , and which satisfy our selection criteria for m33 rgb stars .",
    "the histograms have been scaled to match the area of the deimos fields .",
    "they show that any contribution from mw foreground stars at @xmath39kms@xmath1 is small for the purposes of this _ letter _ , and so this velocity cut is adopted in the following kinematic analysis .",
    "stars with @xmath40kms@xmath1 are predominantly mw foreground , and the small numbers we observe further suggest that the contamination at more negative velocity will be negligible .",
    "the third panel of figure  [ 3fields ] shows the velocity distributions of fields 157 and 158 added together to boost statistics .",
    "we expect the main stellar components in m33 will be well fit by individual gaussians , and any stellar halo component in m33 will have a velocity distribution centered on @xmath41kms@xmath1 . since m33 is @xmath7times less massive than m31 , we expect that the m33 halo velocity dispersion will be @xmath42 that of m31 ( @xmath43kms@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the broad gaussian overlaid in the third panel of figure  [ 3fields ] represents a m33 halo component with a dispersion of @xmath44kms@xmath1 , scaled to match the approximate number of stars observed .",
    "we also expect that the prominent peak of stars in these fields is due to the dominant disk of m33 .",
    "therefore , we have subtracted the halo gaussian from the @xmath36 distribution in the third panel and fitted a gaussian to this peak , centered at @xmath45kms@xmath1 with an uncorrected dispersion @xmath46kms@xmath1 ( corrected dispersion of @xmath47kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "the residuals of this fit show a prominent grouping of stars at @xmath48kms@xmath1 . we fit a third gaussian to this feature , with a peak @xmath49kms@xmath1 and a dispersion @xmath50kms@xmath1 .",
    "the latter quantity is more poorly constrained than given by the formal error , however , as its dispersion is covariant with the dispersion of the disk and halo , which have been fitted independently .",
    "all 3 gaussians and their summed total are overlaid in the third panel of figure  [ 3fields ] .",
    "the fourth panel of figure  [ 3fields ] shows the expected distribution of stars at the positions of fields 157 and 158 , for the model of m33 shown in figure  [ rotcurve ] , combined with a halo model with a radial velocity dispersion of @xmath51kms@xmath1 .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion of the disk is set to @xmath52kms@xmath1 , to mimic our observations .",
    "the normalization of both components is chosen to approximately match the corresponding peaks in the data .",
    "a comparison between model and data shows ( 1 ) the peak at @xmath53kms@xmath1 does not naturally arise as a result of our line - of - sight through the main m33 disk sampling stars at different circular velocities , ( 2 ) the stellar disk is offset in @xmath36 from the hi disk by @xmath54kms@xmath1 , implying a deprojected offset of @xmath55kms@xmath1 . for comparison ,",
    "the asymmetric drift between the stars and hi in the mw and m31 is of order @xmath56kms@xmath1 .",
    "scaling for mass , the expected asymmetric drift in m33 is not likely to be more than @xmath7kms@xmath1 .",
    "we believe that the velocity offset between the two disks is due to differential warping , specifically that the hi disk is warping into our line - of - sight at large radius from m33 .",
    "this has been implied , quite spectacularly , by @xcite ( see their figure  14 ) , and is consistent with the magnitude of the velocity offset .",
    "figure  [ cmd ] shows the color  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the spectroscopically observed m33 rgb stars in fields 157 and 158 , divided by the radial velocity cuts indicated so as to kinematically separate the three candidate components as best as possible .",
    "regina isochrones from @xcite , with @xmath57 color  @xmath58 relations as described by @xcite , corresponding to a 13 gyr stellar population with metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are also overlaid .",
    "the differences between the cmds in figure  [ cmd ] are striking , and appear to validate our kinematic deconvolution . the candidate m33 halo stars are predominantly bluer and have a smaller color dispersion than the candidate disk stars , indicating a difference in the age and/or metallicity properties of the populations . assuming both populations are @xmath61gyrs old implies a median photometric metallicity for the halo of [ fe / h ] @xmath62 , with a dispersion of @xmath63 } } = 0.21 $ ] .",
    "given the small number of stars which contribute to this measurement , this is consistent with the ferguson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) metallicity measurement for the halo , of [ fe / h ] @xmath64 .",
    "the disk has an implied photometric metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath65 and a broader dispersion of @xmath66 } } = 0.35 $ ] .",
    "the median color ( metallicity ) of the ` third component ' is similar to the disk , although its color dispersion is remarkably narrow ( @xmath63 } } = 0.15 $ ] ) .",
    "this population is difficult to isolate kinematically , and our sample could be contaminated by both of the other two components .",
    "however , the locus of its stars on the cmd does not clearly associate it with either the candidate disk or halo population , and is reminiscent of a cmd for a single stellar population .",
    "if this population was due to mw foreground contamination , we would not expect its stars to occupy so well defined a locus in this diagram .",
    "the most probable explanation is that these stars belong to a stellar stream .",
    "these stars do not , however , define a spatially obvious structure , but given our limited field size and that our choice of slitlet position will affect the spatial distribution , this test is inconclusive at best .",
    "we calculate the spectroscopic metallicity of the halo stars by measuring the equivalent width of the cat from stacked spectra , using an identical method to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that [ fe / h ] @xmath67 , in good agreement with the photometric measurement .",
    "the large uncertainty reflects the relatively low signal - to - noise of the stacked spectrum .",
    "we are unable to measure the metallicities of the other two components in this way , since their velocities cause the cat to lie on top of strong sky lines which prevents accurate equivalent width measurements .",
    "m33 is considered an example of the quintessential disk galaxy , with no evidence for any bulge or spheroid component . however , the radial profile for m33 presented in ferguson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , based upon our int - wfc observations , reveals for the first time the presence of a spatially extended , low density component . using keck / deimos ,",
    "we have identified a population of rgb stars which have velocities centered on the systemic velocity of m33 and which appear to have a large dispersion ( @xmath68kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "these stars are bluer than other rgb stars in m33 , with a small color dispersion .",
    "their average metallicity is [ fe / h ] @xmath69 , and we attribute them to the newly discovered halo component of m33 .",
    "the haloes of the mw and m31 have similar metallicities to this ( @xcite ) , even although both these galaxies are @xmath7times more massive than m33 .",
    "it is important to emphasise that there is no evidence of a trend linking halo metallicity to galaxy mass or luminosity for the local group galaxies , as has been suggested from recent hubble space telescope studies of galaxies within @xmath7mpc ( @xcite ) . instead",
    ", all the large local group spiral galaxies appear to have very similar halo metallicities .",
    "we also observe stars in the disk of m33 .",
    "their @xmath36 distribution is well described by a gaussian with an uncorrected dispersion of @xmath70kms@xmath1 , corresponding to a corrected dispersion of @xmath71kms@xmath1 .",
    "these stars are redder and have a broader color dispersion than the halo stars .",
    "the stellar disk is offset in @xmath36 from the hi disk in our simple model by @xmath72kms@xmath1 , which is fully consistent with the extreme warping of the hi disk implied by @xcite .",
    "finally , we present evidence for a third kinematic feature in m33 , revealed by the @xmath36 distribution of the southern fields .",
    "the velocity dispersion of this component is not well constrained by our data .",
    "a comparison to our simple model of the disk of m33 shows that this feature does not arise as a result of our line - of - sight through m33 sampling stars at different circular velocities in the main disk .",
    "the locus of these stars in the cmd has a remarkably small color dispersion , reminiscent of a single stellar population and inconsistent with belonging to a foreground population .",
    "we believe the most likely explanation for this feature is that it is a stellar stream .",
    "however , more spectroscopic observations of fields at different locations around the disk of m33 are required before the true nature of this intriguing feature is revealed .",
