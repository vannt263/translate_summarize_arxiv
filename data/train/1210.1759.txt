    ".standard model contributions to the muon @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,>,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we emphasize , however , that the smallness of the gauge violations due to the omission of @xmath1 and @xmath2 can not be taken as an indication that these terms will not contribute much to the physical , transverse part of the photon four - point functions . as already mentioned above , our previous calculation of these contributions in ref .",
    "@xcite is presumably not correct and needs to be thoroughly reinvestigated .",
    "this will be done in future work .",
    "in this work we investigated in detail key similarities and differences between the enjl and dse approaches . whereas the enjl model features a contact interaction giving rise to a trivial quark wave - function renormalisation and a constant quark mass function , in the dse approach these are both momentum dependent .",
    "the same is true for the gauge part of the vertex , that is determined by a ward - takahashi identity .",
    "whereas in the enjl model this part is trivial , the corresponding ball - chiu terms in the dse approach are nontrivial and momentum dependent . in both approaches there are transverse parts in the vertex which are dominated by the vector meson poles leading to a characteristic behavior also in the space - like momentum region .",
    "when assessing the influence of the different momentum dependent dressing functions of the dse approach as compared to enjl we found partial cancellations .",
    "dressing effects due to the non - trivial wave - function on the level of @xmath3 are cancelled by opposite effects due to the dressing of the gauge part of the vertex . an important effect that is not cancelled",
    "is the one of the dynamical mass function .",
    "we found that this function is not tested predominantly at its large infrared plateau of @xmath4  gev but rather at smaller values at intermediate momenta commensurate with @xmath5  gev .",
    "this gives rise to a larger contribution than expected from constituent quark - loop calculations .",
    "our finding may serve to explain the surprisingly small ( constituent ) quark masses needed in chiral models to obtain sensible results @xcite .",
    "our most interesting result , however , is related to the transverse part of the vertex .",
    "these are of high interest because they dynamically include the phenomenology of vector meson dominance and are expected to reduce the overall light - by - light contribution . as in the enjl model the corresponding behavior of the transverse part of the vertex in the dse - approach is generated dynamically .",
    "a key difference is , however , that in the dse case the dependence on the relative momentum of the quarks is taken into account . on the level of mesons ( as e.g. the @xmath6-meson that is the vital ingredient in vmd )",
    "this takes the distribution of quarks inside the bound state into account , which is not the case in the enjl model @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of this effect , either in the full dse calculation or by a suitable modification of the vmd - term in the enjl model has important consequences : the reduction of the quark - loop contribution to @xmath7 due to vmd effects , observed in previous calculations @xcite , is drastically reduced .",
    "thus we can pinpoint the differences between the dse and enjl calculations to be down to the contact interaction limiting the momentum dependence of dressing functions .",
    "we believe that ignoring the relative quark momentum in the quark - photon vertex overestimates the suppression that the transverse part of the vertex provides and thus lowers significantly it s numerical contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .    our present best result for the quark - loop contribution has been discussed in section [ best ] . combined with our result for the pseudoscalar meson exchange diagram from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath8 , we arrive at the estimate @xmath9 for the total lbl contribution .",
    "again , the error is purely statistical due to our numerics . since at present",
    "any guess of the systematic error of this number is clearly subjective ( due to the omission of terms in the quark - photon vertex ) , we do not attempt such an estimate .",
    "it has to be emphasized , however , that our determination of the quark loop contribution to light - by - light , eq .  ( [ final ] ) is by far not complete since several terms in the vertex dressing are still missing .",
    "the study if the influence of these terms is an important task for the future .",
    "nevertheless we hope that the systematics of the present work serves to give the reader a better understanding of the technical and physical mechanisms at work in the complicated light - by - light scattering contribution .",
    "furthermore we have shown that our best results at present are stable under variations of the photon gauge parameter and therefore serve as an important intermediary step towards a full calculation to come .     + we are grateful to fred jegerlehner and andreas nyffeler for discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the helmholtz international center for fair within the loewe program of the state of hesse , the helmholtz young investigator group under contract vh - ng-332 and dfg under contract fi 970/8 - 1 , and the austrian science fund fwf under project m1333-n16 .",
    "in this appendix we give the explicit basis for the quark - photon vertex .",
    "it was taken from ref .",

    "the photon is not a dynamical field in our formalism .",
    "the photon self - energy that we calculate is performed using quark and quark - photon vertex equations that do not take into account the photon as a dynamical object , but rather as an external background field .",
    "internally all objects just include dynamical quarks and model gluons .",
    "this is why the application of further derivatives on the photon dse is consistent within our approximation .",
    "furthermore this operation leaves the internal consistency of the truncation intact .",
    "in particular the consistency with chiral symmetry and electro - magnetic current - conservation in form of wti s is not destroyed .",
    "this technique is also referred to as gauging @xcite . for a detailed description of this procedure in particular in rainbow - ladder truncation see @xcite .",
    "+ an object that will be needed on several occasions is the quark anti - quark photon - photon vertex . within rainbow - ladder approximation",
    "this object can be exactly written in terms of quark - photon vertices and the t - matrix @xcite @xmath28{2quark2photonvertexdef } ,    }    \\label{eqn : defof2quark2photonvertex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor of two is not a symmetry factor but rather a convenient way to denote that the two possible photon permutations are included .",

    "the derivative has to be applied to the quark - photon vertex and the two dressed quarks of the photon self energy .",
    "since there are two quarks in the loop the second diagram comes again with two permutations that correspond to one diagram with straight photon legs and one with crossed ones .",
    "this is signaled by the factor @xmath30 .",
    "now the application of the relation shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : defof2quark2photonvertex ] ) results in @xmath29{3photonvertex2}.    } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next we take into account the relation between the t - matrix and the g - matrix @xmath31 which says nothing but that the t - matrix is the amputated connected part of the g - matrix . in eq .",

    "the factor @xmath30 can also be interpreted as representing the two possible orientations of the quark loop .",
    "+ now the four - point function is obtained by taking a further derivative with respect to the external photon field .",
    "again the derivative can act on quark - photon vertices and the quark propagators .",
    "the result is      where the additional factor three is caused by the three possible vertices and three propagators respectively . using again relation ( [ eqn : defof2quark2photonvertex ] )",
    "we arrive at @xmath29{4photonvertex2}.    } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to this point no approximations on top of rainbow - ladder truncation of qcd have been made .",

    "<S> we present a refined calculation of the quark - loop contribution to hadronic light - by - light scattering that focuses upon the impact of the transverse components of the quark - photon vertex . </S>",
    "<S> these structures are compared and contrasted with those found within the extended njl - models . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss similarities and differences between the two approaches and further clarify the important role of momentum dependent dressing functions . </S>",
    "<S> as expected we find that the transverse structures of the quark - photon vertex lead to a suppression of the quark - loop contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find evidence that this suppression is overestimated within models with simple approximations for the quark - photon interaction . </S>"
