    "the discovery of the new family of layered iron - based sc materials has attracted much attention since their discovery .",
    "@xcite the parent compounds of iron pnictides are bad metal at low temperatures and exhibit a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order . upon doping either electrons or holes into the system , sdw will be suppressed and superconductivity emerges .",
    "disorder thus can not be avoided in the crystal growth procedure with intentional doping . by substituting the iron ions with transition - metal ( tm ) elements",
    "co or ni ,  @xcite superconductivity can be realized and the dopant ions act as impurities at the same time .",
    "anderson s theorem tells us that the @xmath2-wave superconductivity is insensitive to small sp impurity . while in cuprates ,",
    "impurity effect on the local density of states has been used as a prominent feature of @xmath3-wave superconductor .",
    "@xcite for iron - based superconductors , impurity scattering effect has been theoretically studied intensively  @xcite , but mainly by considering a single impurity .    in tm doped cases ,",
    "doping density is expected to be equal to impurity concentration .",
    "x - ray absorption experiment  @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment  @xcite show that tm substitution effect as well as multi - impurity effect are rich in physics .",
    "experiments have measured the variation of superfluid density as function of temperature in crystal of @xmath4 and in film @xmath4 .",
    "the single crystal  @xcite shows a bcs - like behavior , while the epitaxial film  @xcite has a wide range of linear dependance over temperature .",
    "the difference between the crystal and film samples is usually considered that films are dirtier with large disorder .",
    "impurity effects are sensitive to sc order symmetry .",
    "one commonly believed idea is that the sc order is formed via spin fluctuation , leading to @xmath5-wave  @xcite pairing symmetry in iron pnictide . in this paper",
    "we address the robustness of @xmath5-wave superconductors against multi - impurity and only concern electron doped cases .    by employing a phenomenological model based on bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations ,",
    "we study systematically the multi - impurity effect in iron pnictides .",
    "the impurity hamiltonian is described by an on - site point - like @xmath1-function potential , with sp strength @xmath6 ranging from weak to strong .",
    "multiple impurities have interference effect that can smear out the effect of single impurity .",
    "although order parameters may be suppressed or enhanced on and around impurities , average values of order parameters decrease as @xmath0 increases . and as a whole lattice they obey a statistical distribution function",
    ". we will study the probability distribution functions of normalized order parameters for different @xmath0 , different @xmath1 and different @xmath6 . with increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the height of the peak of distribution functions falls down at the beginning and then goes up for more larger @xmath0 corresponding to the vanished order .",
    "for weak sp , average values of the order parameters do not have qualitative change from that of the impurity - free case even when @xmath0 is very large , suggesting that the system is very robust against weak multi - impurity .",
    "for moderate sp , sc order has finite values at @xmath7 , however , the stripe - like magnetic structure is destroyed .",
