    "be stars are rapidly rotating , non - supergiant b - type stars that exhibit , or have exhibited in the past , emission in their hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "the observed properties of be stars are consistent with the coexistence of a dense circumstellar disk ( flattened in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis ) and a variable stellar wind ( struve 1931 ; doazan 1982 ; slettebak 1988 ; prinja 1989 ; porter & rivinius 2003 ) .",
    "the gas in the so - called `` decretion disk '' is traditionally believed to be ejected from the star and not accreted from an external source ( see , however , harmanec et al .",
    "2002 ; abt 2004 ) .",
    "although there is increasing evidence that the disk gas is in keplerian orbit ( e.g. , hanuschik 1996 ; hummel & vrancken 2000 ) , there is a great deal of evidence that be - star photospheres are rotating too _ slowly _ to propel any atmospheric material into orbit .",
    "typical observationally determined values of the ratio of equatorial rotation speed to the critical rotation speed @xmath1 ( at which gravity is balanced by outward centrifugal forces ) range between 0.5 and 0.8 ( slettebak 1982 ; porter 1996 ; yudin 2001 ) . if this is the case , then any theoretical model for the origin of be - star disks would require a substantial increase in angular momentum between the photosphere and the inner edge of the disk .",
    "recently , the idea that be stars are rotating with significantly subcritical rotation speeds has been called into question .",
    "the primary observational diagnostic of hot - star rotation is the doppler broadening of photospheric absorption lines , first elucidated by abney ( 1877 ) .",
    "rotational broadening provides a surface - weighted measure of the product of the equatorial rotation speed @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the inclination angle to the observer .",
    "traditional means of determining @xmath5 from line profiles ( e.g. , tassoul 1978 ; gray 1992 ) often assume that the star is spherical .",
    "however , rapidly rotating o and b stars tend to become centrifugally distorted into oblate shapes and thus undergo `` gravity darkening '' ( i.e. , a redistribution of radiative flux in proportion to the centrifugally modified gravity ; von zeipel 1924 ) .",
    "the equators of such distorted stars become dimmer and cooler than their poles , and thus the most rapidly rotating regions of the stellar surface are weighted less strongly in the resulting star - averaged absorption profiles .",
    "this tendency for gravity - darkened stars to exhibit narrower profiles than would be the case for spherical stars  and thus lower computed values of @xmath5has been known for more than a half century ( e.g. , slettebak 1949 ; stoeckley 1968 ; hardorp & strittmatter 1968 ; walker et al .   1979 ; collins & truax 1995 ) and has been recently highlighted as a potential bias in statistical samples of be star rotation rates ( zorec et al .",
    "2003 ; townsend et al .   2004 ; cohen et al .   2005 ; frmat et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "a physical understanding of the be phenomenon hinges on how close the stars are rotating to their critical speeds .",
    "if @xmath2 is within one or two sound speeds of @xmath1 ( which would imply @xmath6 ) , there are many possible weak processes that could easily propel gas into orbit ( see , e.g. , owocki 2005 ) .",
    "when the above ratio falls below @xmath70.9 , though , the increased amount of energy and angular momentum addition that would be needed to spin up material into a keplerian disk is large enough to greatly restrict the number and type of potential sources .",
    "townsend et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that gravity darkening effects could be strong enough to make a distribution of nearly critical rotation speeds _",
    "appear _ to be shifted down to values of 0.5@xmath8 if the line profiles were interpreted as if the stars were spherical .",
    "the inclusion of gravity darkening , however , tends to complicate the analysis to the extent that a unique determination of @xmath5 from a single measured line width ( for any individual star ) does not seem to be possible .",
    "this paper attempts to disentangle the above effects by using monte carlo forward modeling to produce a large number of trial probability distributions of @xmath2 .",
    "each distribution is processed , assuming random inclination angles ( and with inclination - dependent line narrowing due to gravity darkening ) , to simulate an observed statistical sample of line widths .",
    "the most likely intrinsic distribution of be - star rotation speeds is thus determined by searching for the models with the minimum @xmath9 differences between the simulated and observed line width distributions .",
    "the derived distributions of @xmath2 , as a function of spectral type , yield important empirical constraints on the _ threshold rotation speeds _ for the occurrence of the be phenomenon .",
    "this forward - modeling method is less ambiguous than the more common inverse technique of using simple geometric transformations to convert an observed distribution of @xmath5 values into either a distribution of intrinsic rotation speeds or a mean value for @xmath2 .",
    "although this kind of analysis has a long history ( e.g. , chandrasekhar & mnch 1950 ; stoeckley 1968 ; lucy 1974 ; balona 1975 ; porter 1996 ; clark & steele 2000 ; chauville et al .",
    "2001 ) , the present work contains several novel features that help to increase the overall level of confidence in the results .",
    "first , the number of observed stars  from the published database of yudin ( 2001)is now large enough to be able to use the detailed _ shapes _ of the number distributions as constraints rather than just their low - order moments .",
    "second , the effects of gravity darkening are included in the most `` conservative '' manner possible , thus taking into account the heterogeneous origins of the @xmath5 entries in the database ( i.e. , gravity darkening was considered in the calculation of some @xmath5 values , but not others ) .",
    "the resulting subcritical values of @xmath2 are thus designed to be safe upper limits , and the actual rotation speeds may be even _ lower _ if the modeled gravity darkening effects were overestimated .",
    "third , the derived rotation speeds are used as inputs to an independent statistical simulation of visible polarization measurements of be - star disks .",
    "the good agreement between the shapes of the observed and simulated distributions of polarization is a useful validation of the derived range of @xmath2 values .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "  2 presents a summary of the yudin ( 2001 ) be - star database and a description of the adopted fundamental stellar parameters that were used to compute @xmath1 and other physical quantities .",
    "  3 describes the monte carlo forward modeling procedure that was used to simulate statistical distributions of be stars , and also gives the resulting best - fit ranges of equatorial rotation speed . the possibility that nonstandard gravity darkening exponents may apply to be stars",
    "is investigated in   4 , and a simulation of linear polarization values for the derived distribution of rotation speeds is presented in   5 .",
    "additional pieces of evidence in favor of the results derived in   3 ( essentially that @xmath10 for early - type be stars ) are laid out in ",
    "a summary of the major results of this paper , together with a discussion of the implications for theories of the be phenomenon , is given in ",
    "the yudin ( 2001 ) database of early - type emission - line stars contains 627 objects with mk spectral types between o7.5e and b9/a0e and luminosity classes between ii / iii and v. care was taken to exclude of , b[e ] , and herbig ae / be stars from this database , thus making it the largest sample of `` classical '' be stars yet assembled .",
    "there are 462 stars in the cataloga/368/912 ) appears to contain only 462 nonzero values of @xmath0 .",
    "this discrepancy is unimportant for any of the statistical results of yudin ( 2001 ) or this paper . ] with nonzero values for the projected rotation speed @xmath0 , and this subsample contains the primary observational data to be compared with the monte carlo model predictions in   3 .",
    "( the lower - case @xmath11 is used here only in combination with @xmath3 to denote the convolved quantity derived empirically from line widths .",
    "the nomenclature @xmath5 is used below only for the product of two known quantities . )    in order to remove potential biases arising from the substantial variation of stellar parameters from the late - o to early - a spectral ranges , the observed values of @xmath0 for each star should be normalized by the star s critical rotation speed .",
    "fundamental parameters ( e.g. , mass @xmath12 and polar radius @xmath13 ) for each star are needed to compute the critical rotation speed , which is defined for a rigidly rotating roche - model star as @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the newtonian gravitation constant ( see , e.g. , jeans 1928 ; collins 1963 ; tassoul 1978 ) .",
    "the above expression is consistent with the existence of continuum radiation pressure as long as von zeipel ( 1924 ) gravity darkening applies and the continuum eddington factor @xmath16 is less than @xmath70.5 ( glatzel 1998 ; maeder & meynet 2000a ) . for completeness ,",
    "the eddington factor is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath19 is the thomson scattering opacity , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the sun s mass and bolometric luminosity . the numerical factor above was computed from a standard solar abundance mixture ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) . for b - type stars , @xmath16 is typically much smaller than 1 , thus justifying the choice of solution branch to the radial force balance equation ( at the surface of the critically rotating star ) that is implied by equation  ( [ eq : vcrit ] ) .",
    "the largest value of @xmath16 in yudin s ( 2001 ) database is 0.23 ( for the o7.5 iii star 68 cyg ) , and there are only 3 other stars out of 627 that have @xmath24 .",
    "the spectral types and luminosity classes listed in yudin s ( 2001 ) catalog were used to compute bolometric luminosities @xmath25 and mean effective temperatures @xmath26 by using the statistical relations of de jager & nieuwenhuijzen ( 1987 ) . their mean",
    "tabulated values were derived from a set of 199 high - precision determinations of @xmath25 and 268 high - precision determinations of @xmath26 across the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram .",
    "for uncertain spectral types and luminosity classes that were listed by yudin ( 2001 ) using two possible values ( e.g. , `` b9/a0 '' or `` iii / iv '' ) , the luminosities and temperatures were computed for each value then averaged logarithmically .",
    "stars without a listed luminosity class were assumed to be main sequence ( class v ) objects .",
    "although more recent calibrations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 exist for the earliest - type stars ( see , e.g. , garcia & bianchi 2004 ; crowther 2005 ) , the de jager & nieuwenhuijzen ( 1987 ) tables remain the most complete and cohesive set of correspondences that is separated by luminosity class .",
    "once @xmath25 and @xmath26 were determined for each star , the stellar mass @xmath12 was computed by interpolating between the evolutionary tracks published by claret ( 2004 ) .",
    "first , the abscissa in the h - r diagram was transformed from @xmath26 to the scaled variable @xmath27 , which skews the main sequence to be roughly vertical .",
    "each of the 30 evolutionary tracks ( spanning initial masses between 0.8 and 126 @xmath20 ) was searched for the point where @xmath28 matched that of the star in question .",
    "the luminosities and masses at these points were saved into one - dimensional arrays , thus effectively giving a tabulation of @xmath12 as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "the actual stellar mass was then computed by linear interpolation using the empirically determined value of @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting mass - luminosity relationships for luminosity classes iii , iv , and v were fit with simple quadratic functions ( in logarithm space ) and are given here for comparison to other calibrations : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "these fits apply only to the late - o to late - b range represented in yudin s ( 2001 ) database ( i.e. , masses between 2.5 and 38 @xmath20 ) and the fits are accurate to within 5% in the mass over this range .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectral type dependence of @xmath1 as computed from equation ( [ eq : vcrit ] ) for luminosity classes iii , iv , and v. corresponding values of the critical rotation speed given by porter ( 1996 ) and yudin ( 2001 ) are also shown . for main sequence stars , the values computed for this paper are in good agreement both with these other plotted values and with the often - cited tables of schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) , underhill ( 1982 ) , harmanec ( 1988 ) , and andersen ( 1991 ) . for luminosity classes iii and iv ,",
    "the computed @xmath1 values are systematically larger than those of yudin ( 2001 ) .",
    "this is the result of the trend that the luminosities of de jager & nieuwenhuijzen ( 1987 ) tend to be on the low side when compared with other calibrations for giants and subgiants . for constant @xmath26 ,",
    "the stellar radius computed with a lower luminosity would be smaller , and thus @xmath1 would be larger .",
    "figure 1 also displays the @xmath1 values computed by chauville et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for each of the 116 be stars in their published database .",
    "these values are plotted with the same symbols for all luminosity classes , and it can be seen clearly that they are about 20% lower than the values derived in this work and on average they are even slightly lower than yudin s ( 2001 ) values .",
    "the reasons for this systematic discrepancy are not clear , although it seems to be at the root of the significant difference between the derived values of the mean ratio @xmath34 of yudin ( 2001 ) and chauville et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; see below .",
    "there are two main pieces of evidence that support the comparatively large values for @xmath1 derived in this paper :    1 .",
    "recent model atmosphere based determinations of b - star fundamental parameters ( fitzpatrick & massa 2005 ) give critical rotation speeds that agree well with the curves shown in figure 1 . for the 5 luminosity class iii stars ( ranging from b3 to a0 ) in the fitzpatrick & massa ( 2005 ) database , the computed values of @xmath1 were all slightly _ larger _ than the values given in figure 1 .",
    "for the 20 ( 17 ) stars of class iv ( v ) , the computed @xmath1 values fell roughly equally above and below the respective curves in figure 1 .",
    "when modeling the properties of be stars above the main sequence ( i.e. , luminosity classes iii and iv ) , it is probably safest to choose the set of critical rotation speeds that cleaves _ closest _ to the main sequence values .",
    "it has been known for some time that rapid rotation and gravity darkening can make a main sequence star appear to be up to a full magnitude brighter than than its surface - averaged luminosity would indicate ( e.g. , maeder & peytremann 1970 ; collins & sonneborn 1977 ; collins et al .",
    "1991 ) . despite some evidence that the be phenomenon occurs only during relatively late evolutionary phases , it is possible that the true distribution of be stars on the h - r diagram remains closer to the main sequence than is implied by the inferred fractions of luminosity class iii and iv stars ( see also fabregat & torrejn 2000 )",
    "therefore , it may err on the side of caution to use the present calibration , which yields relatively high values of @xmath1 for be stars classified as iii and iv .",
    "more work needs to be done to more accurately pin down the fundamental parameters of be stars . by default , the statistical models presented below mainly use the high - end @xmath1 values derived for this paper ( sometimes denoted as `` cranmer '' ) , but a parallel analysis is also done using the low - end chauville et al .",
    "( 2001 ) values .",
    "the 462 stars with measured projected rotation speeds were normalized by dividing yudin s ( 2001 ) tabulated @xmath0 by the computed values of @xmath1 for each star .",
    "the mean value of the ratio @xmath34 was found to be 0.485 , which is slightly smaller than the value of 0.50 found by yudin ( 2001 ) using lower critical rotation speeds .",
    "also , the latter value was computed as the ratio of the mean @xmath0 to the mean @xmath1 , not as the mean value of the set of ratios . the dimensionless standard deviation , skewness , and kurtosis of the distribution of ratios ( as defined by press et al .",
    "1992 ) were found to be 0.167 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the significantly negative kurtosis denotes a flat - topped plateau - like distribution that seems to occur because the full sample of stars is made up of subpopulations with a range of mean values that sweep across the central peak of the full distribution ( see below ) .",
    "this result highlights the usefulness of using the ratio @xmath34 rather than just @xmath0 itself , because yudin ( 2001 ) found that the observed distribution of @xmath0 values was well - represented by a normal distribution .",
    "thus the `` normality '' of the @xmath0 distribution could be related more to the large spread in @xmath1 across the b - type spectral range than to the true distribution of relative rotation rates .    to facilitate the study of the onset of the be phenomenon as a function of spectral type ,",
    "the 462 stars in the database were divided into five subpopulations , two containing 93 stars and three containing 92 stars .",
    "table 1 contains a summary of the properties of these subsamples , which were generated by binning stars of similar @xmath26 . from hot to cool effective temperatures ,",
    "the groups are labeled very early ( ve ) , early ( e ) , medium ( m ) , late ( l ) , and very late ( vl ) .",
    "the exact values of @xmath26 used for the dividing lines between the groups were chosen in order to give all five subpopulations a roughly equal number of stars .",
    "table 1 also lists the mean , standard deviation , skewness , and kurtosis of the @xmath34 distributions for each subpopulation .",
    "for further statistical analysis as a function of spectral type and luminosity class , see yudin ( 2001 ) .",
    "figure 2 displays the number distribution of @xmath37 for all 462 be stars , as well as the distributions for the five subpopulations defined in table 1 , each normalized to an integral of unity ( i.e. , expressed as binned probability densities ) . as noted by yudin ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the mean values of @xmath34 have a systematic dependence on @xmath26 , increasing monotonically from @xmath70.4 for the hottest ( ve ) stars to @xmath70.6 for the coolest ( vl ) stars .",
    "there is no clear spectral type dependence on the standard deviations ( or higher moments ) of the subpopulation distributions .",
    "the distributions are plotted by dividing the region between @xmath38 and 1 into 11 equally spaced bins ; this provides a good balance between resolution and statistics .",
    "note that the smallest and largest computed values of @xmath34 for the full database are 0.035 and 0.912 .",
    "( the fact that there are _ no _ stars with measured @xmath0 that exceed @xmath1 tends to support the conclusion reached below that be stars are not all rotating critically ; see also   4 ) .    as an alternate derivation of the normalized projected rotation speeds ,",
    "the 462 @xmath0 values were also divided by the _ lower _",
    "@xmath1 values indicated by chauville et al .",
    "a least - squares power - law fit was found for the spectral type dependence of the critical rotation speeds from that paper : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a continuous variable that straightforwardly denotes the spectral subtype ( for o5 , b0 , and b9 , @xmath41 , 1.0 , and 1.9 , respectively ) .",
    "this fit does not reflect the spread in values from the range of luminosity classes ( see figure 1 ) but it accurately models the trend for the chauville et al .",
    "critical speeds to be lower than those derived by others .",
    "table 1 gives the mean , standard deviation , skewness , and kurtosis of the @xmath34 distributions for each subpopulation using this alternate calibration for @xmath1 .",
    "for the earliest spectral bin , ve , the mean ratio of 0.49 is only slightly higher than the value of 0.41 that corresponds to the @xmath1 calibration derived above .",
    "the differences between the two calibrations grow steadily larger for the cooler spectral bins , leading to mean ratios of either 0.90 ( chauville et al . ) or 0.59 ( cranmer ) for the vl subpopulation , depending on @xmath1 . for the entire database , the mean ratio using the chauville et al .",
    "calibration for @xmath1 is 0.627 ; this is very close to the value of 0.65 given by chauville et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for their sample of 116 be stars .",
    "this value is almost 30% higher than the mean ratio of 0.485 that was computed above , and the difference is due solely to the differences in stellar mass and radius that go into the calculation of the critical rotation speed .",
    "in this section the procedure for simulating theoretical distributions of @xmath34 for a random sample of be stars is described .",
    "the simulation of @xmath0 measurements for individual gravity darkened stars is outlined in   3.1 ( see also collins 1974 ; collins & truax 1995 ; townsend et al .",
    "the construction of theoretical probability distributions for a large number of stars , together with the comparison with the observed distributions , is described in   3.2 .",
    "for a given set of fundamental stellar parameters ( mass , luminosity , and polar radius ) , an equatorial rotation rate ( @xmath2 ) , and an observational inclination angle ( @xmath4 ) , it is possible to compute unique absorption line profile shapes that can be used as direct measures of the quantity @xmath34 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the effect of oblateness and von zeipel ( 1924 ) gravity darkening on the absorption line shape for a representative late - b main sequence star ( see also cohen et al .",
    "as expected , gravity darkening preferentially weights the more slowly rotating polar regions and thus produces a narrower line profile than that computed without gravity darkening .",
    "to produce the images and profiles in figure 3 , the computer code from cranmer & owocki ( 1995 ) was used to generate high - resolution models of both a spherical star and an oblate roche - model star with the same polar radius and equatorial rotation velocity .",
    "the stars are observed from a large distance ( 1000 @xmath13 ) at a given inclination angle , and the same limb darkening law is applied in both cases ( see below ) .",
    "each pixel of the image has a projected linear dimension of 0.008 @xmath13 in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight that crosses through the center of the star .",
    "the rotationally broadened profiles , here assumed to be the commonly used @xmath424471 absorption lines , were simulated for the two cases shown in figure 3 by the following procedure .",
    "the residual flux is defined as the ratio of the flux in the spectral line to that of the surrounding continuum , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are spatial coordinates that specify a grid of rays parallel to the observer s line of sight . for the subset of these rays that intercept the stellar surface ,",
    "cranmer & owocki ( 1995 ) and cranmer ( 1996 ) described how to convert these coordinates into star - centered spherical coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( ignoring the azimuthal longitude @xmath48 because the stars are assumed to be axially symmetric ) .",
    "the colatitude @xmath47 determines the local magnitude of the centrifugally modified effective gravity , and also  for the oblate gravity - darkened case  the local effective temperature .    for simplicity ,",
    "the specific intensity of the continuum is modeled as the product of a planck function at the local effective temperature and a linear limb darkening function , i.e. , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the continuum limb darkening constant and @xmath51 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the stellar surface .",
    "below , we adopt @xmath52 from both a classical treatment of limb darkening for a gray temperature distribution at a continuum wavelength of 4471  ( see eq .  10 - 20 of mihalas 1978 ) and a numerical study of limb darkening for rapidly rotating b stars ( table 4 of collins & truax 1995 ) . the specific intensity in the spectral line @xmath53",
    "is modeled as the product of @xmath54 and a residual intensity @xmath55 that is computed from milne - eddington theory for a pure absorption line , with @xmath56 ( mihalas 1978 ; collins 1989 ) .",
    "the dimensionless line absorption coefficient @xmath57 is modeled as a voigt profile that is thermally broadened and doppler shifted by the stellar rotation , @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the standard voigt function , @xmath61 is the rest - frame frequency of the line transition , @xmath62 is the projected component of the rotation velocity along the line of sight for this ray , and @xmath63 is the thermal speed of helium atoms corresponding to the local effective temperature .",
    "the dimensionless strength of the voigt wings is assumed here to be given by a constant value of @xmath64 based on standard stark broadening for the @xmath424471 line at a mean b - star temperature of @xmath65 k ( e.g. , griem et al .   1962 ; barnard et al .   1969 ; leckrone 1971 ) .",

    "is certainly more simplistic and approximate than performing full model atmosphere calculations of the relevant line profiles ( as was done by , e.g. , townsend et al .",
    ". however , the relative ease of computing reasonably accurate profile shapes by the above method allows _ very fine grids _ of wavelengths , inclination angles , and rotation speeds to be computed without prohibitive computational expense .",
    "these grids make possible the detailed statistical studies described below .",
    "spectral lines were computed for representative main sequence stars of spectral types b0 , b2 , b3 , b5 , and b9 ; i.e. , for stars roughly at the centers of the five subpopulation bins defined in   2 . for each spectral type ,",
    "line profiles for the spherical and the oblate gravity darkened cases were computed on a fine grid of 200 wavelength points , and for 100 inclinations ( @xmath4 between 0 and 90 ) and 100 equatorial rotation speeds ( @xmath72 between 0 and 1 ) .",
    "a single measure of the line width was determined from the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the numerically computed profiles .",
    "the key parameter to be used below is the dimensionless ratio @xmath73 , which is defined as the fwhm line width for a model star computed with oblateness and gravity darkening divided by the corresponding fwhm for the spherical model .",

    "( 2004 ) , and figure 7 of frmat et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but for different spectral types .",
    "these other figures have tended to plot the computed line widths as functions of _ projected _ rotation speeds , which highlights the ambiguity involved with attempting to determine the product @xmath5 from from an `` observed '' @xmath0 .",
    "the forward modeling procedure outlined in this paper is essentially free of such ambiguity .",

    "there are noticeable differences between the shapes of the contours in the b0 and b9 cases shown in figure 4 . the intermediate ( b2 , b3 , b5 ) spectral types have contours in @xmath73 that change in shape gradually between the two plotted extreme cases .",
    "these differences arise because the @xmath424471 equivalent widths , as interpolated from the modeled spectra of gonzlez delgado & leitherer ( 1999 ) , depend on latitude differently for different ranges of effective gravity and temperature .",

    "the `` mean uncertainty level '' @xmath84 is kept constant for any given sample of model stars , though the effects of varying this parameter between 0 and 0.3 are explored below ( see also balona 1975 ) .",

    "two such assumptions regarding the use of @xmath73 in equation  ( [ eq : vsinimeas ] ) are adopted here :    1 .   despite the variations of @xmath73 as a function of spectral type , in the statistical models below we apply the grid of @xmath73 values computed for the b9 case to _ all _ of the spectral - type subpopulations .",
    "this is done because the b9 case shows the strongest line - narrowing effect due to gravity darkening ( i.e. , the lowest values of @xmath73 for rapid rotation and edge - on inclination ) .",

    "when compared with observed values of @xmath34 , then , the resulting _ derived _ @xmath2 would end up being an overestimate .",
    "the fact that @xmath73 is included at all in the equation above implies that the reported measurements of @xmath34 have _ not _ taken gravity darkening into account . however , several of the sources of observational @xmath0 data used by yudin ( 2001 ) certainly did their best to account for gravity darkening , and thus they reported processed estimates of @xmath5 rather than raw measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "if this is the case for a substantial fraction of the observations , then the use of equation  ( [ eq : vsinimeas ] ) would lead to a systematic underestimation of @xmath34 .",
    "this effect works in the same sense as the overestimation of the strength of line narrowing from using the b9 models for all spectral types .",

    "this is understandable because the simulated distributions @xmath88 are modeled essentially as a convolution between two distributions : the intrinsic distribution of @xmath2 values and the normally distributed spread of uncertainties ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "if all of these distributions were gaussian in shape , a specified width of @xmath107 could be obtained for an infinite number of choices for @xmath106 and @xmath83 , as long as the root - mean - squared sum of their widths equaled the desired width of @xmath107 . any future attempts to simulate these kinds of number distributions",
    "must be sure to model the observational uncertainties as accurately as possible .",
    "it is also worth noting that the choice of trapezoidal parameterization for @xmath89 ( eq .  [ [ eq : psidef ] ] ) was somewhat limiting because even the `` best fitting '' choices of the parameters did not yield perfect fits to the observed distributions @xmath88 .",
    "for example , the strongly nonmonotonic behavior in the observed e subsample , for @xmath1430.7 , limited the best - fit values of the probability @xmath134 to be never larger than 50% .",

    "the remaining basic stellar parameters ( @xmath13 , @xmath12 , and @xmath25 ) were interpolated from the relationships derived in   2 , assuming that all stars are on the main sequence ( luminosity class v ) .",
    "the equatorial values of the stellar radius @xmath175 and effective temperature @xmath176 were computed assuming roche oblateness and ideal von zeipel gravity darkening ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "the disk temperature ( @xmath177 ) was assumed to be constant and equal to 0.75 times @xmath176 ( mcdavid 2001 ) .",
    "the disk itself was modeled as occupying a spherical sector around the equatorial plane with an opening half - angle @xmath178 .",
    "the disk extends from its inner edge ( assumed to be coincident with the star s equatorial radius @xmath175 ) to infinity with a power - law dependence of electron density with radius , @xmath179 following mcdavid ( 2001 ) , the constant value of @xmath180 is adopted for all stars . in an attempt to account for the large variation of fundamental parameters across the b - type spectral range ,",
    "the inner disk density @xmath181 was assumed to depend on @xmath26 as @xmath182 this relation was derived from a linear fit ( in @xmath183 versus @xmath184 ) to a total of 23 measured inner disk densities for be stars with spectral types ranging between b0.5 and b8 ( waters et al .",
    "1987 ; mcdavid 2001 ) .",
    "figure 10 shows the @xmath26 dependence of these values and compares the measurements to the above fit .",
    "the estimated mass densities @xmath185 were computed under the assumption of complete hydrogen ionization ; thus @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the mass of a hydrogen atom .    to gauge the approximate validity of the derived inner disk densities , figure 10 also plots two other densities that are expected to bracket these values from above and below .",
    "the photospheric mass densities are computed from the criterion that , in the stellar photosphere , the rosseland mean optical depth should have a value of approximately one : @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the photospheric scale height ( proportional to @xmath190 ) and @xmath191 is the rosseland mean opacity ( in @xmath192 g@xmath193 ) interpolated from the extensive tabulation of kurucz ( 1992 ) .",
    "the resulting photospheric densities were compared with densities from detailed model atmospheres and were found to agree to within about @xmath19420% ( r.   l.   kurucz 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "figure 10 also shows an upper limit for the mass density at the sonic point of the equatorial outflow ( i.e. , the radius at which the radial flow speed equals the sound speed @xmath195 ) , i.e. , @xmath196 where the mass loss rate @xmath197 was computed from the stellar wind parameterization of vink et al .",
    "the use of these values presumes that the disk mass fluxes are of the same order of magnitude as the polar wind mass fluxes ( see   5.1 of bjorkman 2000a ) . the radius @xmath46 is set to @xmath175 , though it should be noted that in a slowly expanding viscous decretion disk , the sonic radius may be much larger ( e.g. , okazaki 2001 ) and thus the sonic density may be smaller .",
    "the sound speed @xmath195 is assumed to be constant inside the disk , @xmath198 where the adiabatic exponent @xmath199 is 5/3 , @xmath200 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath51 is the mean molecular weight of the gas ( we assume @xmath201 ) .",
    "the fact that the inner disk density falls between the photospheric density and the sonic density indicates that the base of the disk is most likely highly subsonic ( i.e. , close to the stellar surface ) , but is also sitting several scale heights _ above _ the photosphere .",
    "the opening half - angle @xmath178 of the equatorial envelope was computed from the basic theory of keplerian accretion disks , with @xmath202 ( see , e.g. , pringle 1981 ) . in the above equation , @xmath203 is the keplerian azimuthal velocity at distance @xmath46 , here computed at a fiducial distance of @xmath204 .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath205 is an order - unity correction factor that is adjusted to produce an overall level of polarization similar to what is observed .",
    "the _ shape _ of the resulting distribution of @xmath172 versus @xmath0 does not depend strongly on the value chosen for @xmath205 , as long as the same value is used for all stars in the simulated sample . in the models presented below , @xmath206 , which yielded a realistic range of @xmath178 angles between 3 and 10 .",
    "the polarization from an axisymmetric disk is proportional to @xmath207 , and for the small angles assumed here this is approximately a linearly increasing function of @xmath178 .",
    "the above properties are the necessary inputs to the single - scattering formulae of mcdavid ( 2001 ) . the straightforward @xmath208 inclination dependence of that model , though , has been replaced by a more accurate relation that takes account of stellar occultation by a thin disk ( i.e. , eqs .",
    "[ 17 ] and [ 19 ] of fox & brown 1991 ) . the mcdavid ( 2001 )",
    "model was also simplified in two ways : ( 1 ) the relatively weak non - lte effects for hydrogen were ignored , and ( 2 ) the polarization was computed only at the center of the @xmath209 filter band ( 5500  ) instead of using the full bandpass function .",
    "the simulated values of @xmath210 for each star were computed by using equation  ( [ eq : vsinimeas ] ) with @xmath135 .    in figure 11 ,",
    "the observed and simulated distributions of @xmath172 are compared with one another for statistical samples of 335 stars each .",
    "the dotted triangular limits are shown only as a rough envelope of the @xmath0 dependent spread of values , and are the same in both plots . despite minor differences , the shapes of the observed and modeled distributions are similar .",
    "the rising upper envelope at low values of @xmath0 can be understood from the approximate @xmath208 dependence of the polarization , since the lowest projected rotation speeds correspond to the lowest inclination angles ( see also mclean & brown 1978 ) .",
    "the decrease in the upper envelope for the largest values of @xmath0 , however , is not so easy to interpret .",
    "yudin ( 2001 ) suggested three possible explanations for this decrease in @xmath172 spread for the fastest rotators .",
    "two of these effects ( depolarization from the oblate gravity - darkened star itself , and lower intrinsic polarization for disks around the later - type stars that also have the highest values of @xmath2 ) were not thought to be strong enough to produce the observed decreases .",
    "the third proposed effect was that the opening angle @xmath178 may be inversely proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "whereas something like this may have been true for the wind - compressed disk model of bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) , the thickness of a true viscous decretion disk seems most likely to become relatively uncoupled from the rotational properties of the central object ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : akep ] ] ) .",
    "the simulated distribution of @xmath172 values shown in figure 11b does seem to match the observed strong decrease in spread at the largest values of @xmath0 in figure 11a .",
    "this was found to occur because the models were computed using the gravity darkened equatorial temperature @xmath176 as the argument of equation  ( [ eq : ne0 ] ) .",
    "the most rapidly rotating stars with the lowest values of @xmath176 were thus given the lowest disk densities .",
    "a contributing factor was that these stars tended to be late - type be stars with the lowest effective temperatures and the smallest radii .",
    "the stellar radius comes into play because the electron - scattering emissivity depends on the total number of electrons in the emitting volume ( i.e. , on the product @xmath211 ) .",
    "it remains to be shown whether the be stars undergoing the most rapid rotation indeed have lower - density disks as predicted above .",
    "this seems somewhat counterintuitive , since whatever mechanisms that produce the disks are likely to grow in strength as the stellar rotation increases above the disk formation threshold ( presumably at @xmath93 ) .",
    "however , for some combinations of stellar properties and rotation rate , the mass loss from the disk may come to dominate the angular momentum transport that feeds the disk , and lower densities may occur because of greater leakage to an equatorial wind . more work needs to be done to compare the derived disk properties of stars with similar spectral types but different rotation rates .",
    "the results obtained above imply that early - type be stars can be rotating at significantly subcritical rates ( down to roughly half of their critical rotation speed ) .",
    "this conclusion seems at odds with the recent statistical arguments of townsend et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that suggest nearly all be stars could be rotating nearly critically .",
    "there are several additional pieces of evidence that can be brought to bear on this disagreement , and these ideas also imply subcritical rotation for at least some be stars .",
    "recent interferometric observations have put constraints on the inclination angles of some bright be stars . specifically , both quirrenbach et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and tycner et al .",
    "( 2004 ) measured an extreme axial ratio for the circumstellar envelope of @xmath83  tau that implies @xmath212 .",

    "( 2005 ) estimated that @xmath72 for this star is no more than @xmath70.52 . using the range of @xmath1 values computed in this paper for @xmath83  tau and similarly dividing @xmath79 by @xmath214 yields a slightly wider range of ratios : 0.48 to 0.56 . assuming that gravity darkening was not taken into account in the derivation of @xmath0 , the strongest possible correction would be to divide the above ratios by the _ smallest _ allowable value of @xmath73 ( i.e. , 0.68 for a b9 star ) , thus giving a range of @xmath72 for this star of 0.700.82 .",
    "given that the minimum value of @xmath73 that corresponds to a b1 type star would be higher ( @xmath70.80 ) , the subcritical nature of this star s rotation appears definite .",
    "future interferometric measurements are expected to bring about similar examples of firm subcritical rotation . between 0.7 and 0.9 , but applying the maximum possible correction for gravity darkening brings these stars to nearly critical rotation .",
    "the case of @xmath215  tau , for which tycner et al .",
    "give a ratio of 0.53 , seems to be anomalous because a main - sequence @xmath1 was used for this giant star ; using the even the high - end value computed in this paper results in a ratio @xmath72 of 0.80 .",
    "this star is thus in the same category as the five others discussed by tycner et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , excluding @xmath83  tau , and more detailed analysis must be performed to determine the star - specific corrections for gravity darkening . ]    in addition to rotationally broadened spectral lines , another potentially useful measure of near - critical rotation may be the large - scale shape of a star s spectral energy distribution ( i.e. , rotational `` color effects '' ) .",
    "it has been known for some time ( e.g. , collins 1965 ; kodaira & hoekstra 1979 ) that gravity darkening can lead to more pronounced color variations in the ultraviolet than in the visible , though it is unclear how tightly these variations can be calibrated to provide a direct measurement of the rotation rate or the inclination .",
    "stalio et al .   (",
    "1987 ) examined far - ultraviolet flux distributions of several be stars and was able to rule out extreme gravity darkening signatures .",
    "stalio et al .   made the preliminary conclusion that @xmath216 for the observed stars .",
    "collins & sonneborn ( 1977 ) argued that critical rotation is unlikely for all be stars because of the large predicted photometric shift above the main sequence .",
    "b - type stars rotating at 90% of their critical angular velocity ( i.e. , @xmath217 ) showed roughly a 1 magnitude increase in @xmath209-band absolute magnitude , while critical rotators showed more than a 2 magnitude increase .",
    "the presence of many be stars at only @xmath71 magnitude above the main sequence seemed to collins & sonneborn ( 1977 ) to be evidence against critical rotation .",
    "note , though , that more recent calculations of photometric shifts due to rapid rotation have predicted a substantially weaker enhancement ( see figure 3 of townsend et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "mennickent et al .   (",
    "1994 ) studied the detailed statistics of h@xmath178 spectral line shapes as a function of @xmath0 . from the observed spread of the measurements",
    ", they concluded that there is `` ... evidence for a considerable range of the true rotation velocities of be stars : definitely there are intrinsically slow rotators among them . ''    finally",
    ", the observed _ variability _ of be - star circumstellar envelopes may be related to the division found in this paper between subcritical rotation ( for early - type be stars ) and nearly critical rotation ( for late - type be stars ) .",
    "early - type be stars are often observed to undergo strong outburst phases with an inferred rapid evacuation and refilling of the circumstellar disk region ( see , e.g. , rivinius et al .   1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "late - type be stars are found to be comparatively quiescent , with the transitions between be and normal - b phases being more gradual .",
    "if the rotation rates of the early - type be stars are far below their respective @xmath1 limits , they may require an impulsive mechanism of disk formation .",
    "models of isotropic ejection from a point on the star  with some material being propelled forward into orbit and some propelled backward to fall back onto the star  may be needed to explain the disks around the hottest be stars ( kroll & hanuschik 1997 ; owocki & cranmer 2002 ) . if , on the other hand , the coolest be stars have nearly critical rotation rates , rapid outbursts as described above may not be needed for material to leak outwards into a viscous decretion disk ( see also clark et al .   2003 ; owocki 2005 ) .",
    "this paper contains a statistical analysis of the equatorial rotation rates of be stars in yudin s ( 2001 ) database . a new monte carlo forward modeling procedure was developed to simulate number distributions of @xmath0 for samples of strongly gravity - darkened hot stars .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath2 distributions that best fit the observations were determined by a rigorous search of parameter space and a minimization of the appropriate @xmath91 statistic .",
    "although there were some variations in the resulting parameters depending on the assumed calibration of @xmath1 , the overall results seem robust .",
    "early - type ( o7e  b2e ) be stars were found to exhibit a spread of equatorial rotation speed between a lower limit of 0.40.6 @xmath1 and an upper limit of critical rotation .",
    "late - type ( b3e  a0e ) be stars exhibit progressively narrower ranges of rotation speed as @xmath26 decreases ; the lower limit rises gradually to 100% of critical rotation and the upper limit remains near the critical level . uncertainties in @xmath1 make it impossible to rule out critical rotation for be stars later than about @xmath7b3 , but the result of substantially _ subcritical _ rotation for b0e  b2e stars appears to be firm .",
    "this paper ( see figure 8) thus seems to imply the existence of a rough dividing line in effective temperature between two qualitatively different types of be phenomenon :    1 .",
    "for @xmath218 the threshold ratio @xmath219 above which a disk can form is well below unity .",
    "this seems to correspond to the regime of early - type be stars that undergo violent ( possibly pulsation - driven ) outbursts that feed the circumstellar disk .",
    "2 .   for @xmath220",
    "the threshold ratio @xmath219 ratio grows to unity as @xmath26 decreases to the end of the b spectral range .",
    "the late - type be stars at these temperatures are seen to be more quiescent than their early - type counterparts , and this may be due to the relative ease of generating a keplerian disk for their closer proximity to critical rotation .    the above results for early - type be stars are in disagreement with other recent suggestions that the be phenomenon is closely linked to critical or near - critical rotation ( see , e.g. , maeder & meynet 2000b ) . pushing the @xmath93 threshold down to significantly subcritical",
    "rotation speeds makes it more difficult to explain the existence of keplerian decretion disks around be stars .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper can be improved in several ways to increase confidence in the results .",
    "the observational determination of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and possibly also the inclination angle @xmath4 itself can be done more rigorously for an individual star when more than just one line profile is available ( stoeckley & buscombe 1987 ; reiners 2003 ; frmat et al .",
    "2005 ) . for large @xmath0 databases like that of yudin ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the tabulated observational uncertainties should be utilized to a greater degree in producing comparable simulated samples .",
    "the assumption used in this paper of normally distributed uncertainties normalized by a single value of @xmath84 may have contributed to systematic biases that a more observationally guided procedure could correct .",
    "the various analyses performed here should also be done for catalogs of normal b - type stars that do not exhibit emission lines ( see , e.g. , gbocki & stawikowski 2000 ; abt et al .   2002 ) .",
    "it is still unclear if exceeding the minimum threshold rotation speed determined in this paper is both necessary and sufficient for the onset of the be phenomenon ; there may be many non - be stars with @xmath171 .",
    "it is also not clear what sets the observed fraction of be - star incidence as a function of the larger population of early - type stars ( see , e.g. , zorec & briot 1997 ; penny et al .   2004 ) .",
    "firmer constraints on the rotation distributions of each population would be helpful .",
    "the definition of a truly `` normal '' b star is problematic , though , because a be star can spend many years in a phase without a circumstellar disk and thus would have exhibited no balmer emission over the entire time period of observations .",
    "there may be many early - type stars that will eventually become be stars but are still classified as normal b stars .",
    "our understanding of the rotation threshold for the onset of the be phenomenon can be aided by incorporating other kinds of observations that were not studied in this paper .",
    "better interferometric measurements that can constrain tightly both the stellar oblateness and the circumstellar disk geometry ( mcalister et al .   2005 ;",
    "tycner et al .",
    "2005 ) are becoming more widely available . in the long term ,",
    "space - based missions like the proposed _ stellar imager _",
    "may provide direct images of the oblate and gravity darkened stellar surfaces as well as firm constraints on differential rotation and macroturbulence ( carpenter et al .",
    "measuring the widths of lines that are formed in the narrow `` boundary layer '' above the subcritical photosphere , but below the inner edge of the keplerian disk ( e.g. , chen et al .",
