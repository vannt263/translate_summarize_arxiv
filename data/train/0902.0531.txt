    "these spatially inhomogeneous reversals proceed as a traveling `` front '' between regions in the crystal with opposing magnetization and have been described as magnetic deflagration in analogy with chemical deflagration @xcite .    in general",
    ", the speed of a deflagration front is governed by two parameters : the thermal diffusivity , @xmath14 , which specifies the rate at which heat diffuses through the medium , and the reaction rate of the constituents , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the `` flame temperature '' produced by the reactants near the front .",
    "combining these parameters gives an approximate expression for the speed , @xmath17 @xcite . in the case of magnetic deflagration ,",

    "@xcite , the avalanche progresses through the crystal in a similar fashion to that of a domain wall in a ferromagnet @xcite .",

    "the speeds of the avalanches increase as the field is increased .",
    "this is expected since increasing the field both lowers the barrier and increases @xmath75 .",
    "there are local maxima at fields corresponding to the tunneling resonances , which are denoted with vertical dotted lines .",
    "this tunneling enhancement of the avalanche speed is consistent with previously reported results @xcite .",
    "it is also an indication that the flame temperatures are low enough to preserve the effective hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] , and the rigid spin ( @xmath1 ) approximation .",
    "figure [ fixedu ] shows the speed for class ii avalanches triggered at fixed values of the external field .",
    "in particular , data are shown for @xmath76 t and @xmath77 t. by keeping the field fixed and varying the initial magnetization , only @xmath75 varies while @xmath11 remains approximately fixed .",
    "as @xmath49 decreases , so does the speed .",
    "figure [ fixede ] shows the speed for class iii avalanches triggered at various external fields .",
    "the initial magnetizations were also varied such that @xmath75 remained approximately constant .",
    "presumably , the flame temperature is also nearly constant for all avalanches so prepared .",
    "therefore , the variation in avalanche speeds should be due to variation in the field - dependent barrier @xmath11 .",
    "again , the vertical dotted lines drawn on fig . [ fixede ] denote the location of the resonant fields for mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "figure [ four crystals ] compares the class ii avalanche speeds for all four crystals .",
    "the speed of the avalanche varies considerably from sample to sample ; however , any dependence on the sample dimensions is not immediately obvious .",
    "garanin and chudnovsky @xcite developed a comprehensive theory of magnetic deflagration describing the ignition and propagation of the deflagration front .",
    "for a planar front , the avalanche speed is given over a broad range of parameters by the simple approximate expression @xcite :    @xmath78    where @xmath16 is the temperature at the front ( flame temperature ) , @xmath14 is the thermal diffusivity , @xmath79 is the field - dependent barrier in units of kelvin , and @xmath80 is the relaxation rate of the metastable spins ( eq . [ arrhenius ] ) .    ref .",
    "@xcite established the importance of the dipolar fields in mn@xmath0-ac , as a fully magnetized sample adds ( or subtracts ) @xmath81 mt to the applied external field , @xmath82 .",
    "we account for the initial magnetization , @xmath42 , when calculating the various field dependent quantities using @xmath54 , where @xmath83 mt @xmath84 mt ( see fig . [ mvsh ] ) .",
    "the barrier @xmath85 is calculated from the effective spin hamiltonian ( eq . [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the average magnetic energy released by the relaxing spins ( eq . [ e ] ) leads to an increase in the temperature near the front . assuming no heat loss , the maximum possible temperature , @xmath73 , can be calculated using the experimental heat capacity reported in ref .",
    "the heat capacity of mn@xmath0-ac depends on the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we subtract the calculated zero - field spin ( schottky ) contribution from the measured zero - field heat capacity from the data reported in ref . @xcite . to this",
    "we add the calculated spin contribution at a specified field , @xmath3 , for the total field dependent heat capacity @xmath86 . by equating the integral of this heat capacity to the average energy released per molecule , @xmath57 , we can calculate @xmath73 , @xmath87 we assume the initial ( ignition ) temperature is much less than @xmath73 .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation , as the ignition temperatures for avalanches triggered above @xmath88 t are below @xmath88 k ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) compared with values calculated for @xmath73 between 7 and 18 k ( depending on @xmath57 ) .",
    "@xmath73 ( for @xmath89 t ) is shown as a function of @xmath57 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ speedsvswf ] ( a ) .",
    "we now proceed to compare our data with the theory of garanin and chudnovsky @xcite as given by eq .",
    "if we assume that the thermal diffusivity @xmath14 is a constant ( or a weak function of temperature ) , then the speeds for all avalanches should lie on a single curve when plotted as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ speedsvswf ] shows avalanche speeds for crystal a for the three different experimental protocols shown in figs .",
    "[ fixedm ] , [ fixedu ] , and [ fixede ] plotted as a function of @xmath90 . although the overall behavior for the three types of avalanches is similar , the data do not lie on one curve .",
    "the deviations could arise from several factors .",
    "( 1 ) we have used an arrhenius form for the magnetic relaxation ; departures from arrhenius law behavior are unlikely to be responsible for the deviations as it has been found experimentally to hold reasonably well in the range of temperature of our experiment @xcite . ( 2 ) the thermal diffusivity is known to depend on temperature , while we have assumed it to be constant . ( 3 ) the flame temperature may be lower than the value calculated from the specific heat , as some of the energy may escape the sample , or be distributed ahead of the front . ( 4 ) the barrier @xmath11 may be reduced by the transverse component of the inhomogeneous field , @xmath62 , established at the traveling front by the reversing spins ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ scopedata ] ) .",
    "the effects of @xmath62 can be included in the calculation of @xmath11 by including an additional zeeman term @xmath91 in eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath62 provides a symmetry - breaking term that increases the tunneling rate @xcite .",
    "we note that the deviations shown in fig .",
    "[ speedsvswf ] are especially pronounced at high values of @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , the class i avalanches with @xmath92 ( shown as filled diamonds ) have the highest speeds .",
    "this suggests that reduction of the potential barrier @xmath11 for large @xmath49 plays an important role .",
    "it is unclear how to incorporate the effects of a spatially inhomogeneous transverse field component into the analytical theory of magnetic deflagration ( eq .",
    "[ eom ] ) .",
    "instead , we include the effects of @xmath62 on the relaxation rate by introducing an effective barrier : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is determined empirically @xcite .",
    "although the scaling factor @xmath95 explicitly contains @xmath42 ( thus appearing to be used twice ) , it is used here only to account for the size of @xmath62 .",
    "this is justified by our experiment , since the maximum value of @xmath62measured by the hall sensors during an avalanche is found to be proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ fits ] ( a ) demonstrates that a collapse onto a single curve is obtained for @xmath96",
    ". however , the collapsed curve does not agree with the theory , shown by the dashed curve .",
    "an additional step can bring them into line , as described below .    as pointed out earlier , due to possible heat loss through the edges of the crystal and/or heat diffusion ahead of the front , the flame temperature @xmath16",
    "may well be less than @xmath73 . assuming that @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath73 , the constant of proportionality is deduced from fitting the data in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fits ] ( a ) with eq .",
    "the diffusivity , still assumed to be temperature - independent , is also treated as a fitting parameter . as shown in the main part of fig .",
    "[ fits ] ( a ) , agreement with theory is obtained for crystal a for @xmath97 and @xmath98 m@xmath24/s . using this analysis ,",
    "all crystals show similar dependence on the barrier @xmath99 and the flame temperature @xmath16 and yield @xmath100 .",
    "however , we find that the thermal diffusivity ranges from 1.2 @xmath101 to 8.7 @xmath101 m@xmath24/s from crystal to crystal .",
    "the fact that @xmath16 is the same fraction , @xmath102 , for all crystals is a puzzle .",
    "the rate at which heat escapes the crystal during an avalanche must affect @xmath16 .",
    "the rate of heat loss is controlled primarily by the crystal cross section , surface roughness , and the thermal mounting conditions .",
    "variations in the mounting conditions inevitably occur ( e.g. , thickness of insulating grease ) , although every effort was made to use similar conditions from crystal to crystal .",
    "there were no obvious visible differences in surface quality of the crystals .",
    "the cross sections , however , were deliberately varied from @xmath103 to @xmath104 mm@xmath24 .",
    "one expects that the crystals with smaller cross sections should lose more heat through the boundaries and should consequently have lower flame temperatures and , according to eq .",
    "[ eom ] , smaller speeds .",
    "figure [ four crystals ] shows that the maximum speeds vary by approximately a factor of 2.5 from crystal to crystal , but without the expected dependence on cross section .",
    "this implies that the widely different avalanche speeds in the four crystals ( see fig . 6 ) are unlikely to be due primarily to heat loss .",
    "instead , we suggest that the variation of the avalanche speeds are attributable to variations of @xmath14 . the thermal diffusivity of dielectric crystals ( like mn@xmath0-ac ) at low temperatures is known to be strongly dependent on the defects , surface roughness , and dislocations in the crystal @xcite .",
    "an additional puzzle is the large amount by which the potential barrier needs to be reduced to obtain a fit by the above analysis . from our data ,",
    "we deduce a barrier @xmath99 that is 87% of the classically calculated barrier , @xmath11 .",
    "a straightforward calculation implies that a transverse field of @xmath105 t is required to reduce the barrier by that amount .",
    "the largest @xmath62 field recorded by the hall sensors during an avalanche is only @xmath106 t , an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "although it may contribute to it , the measured transverse field can not by itself account for the large reduction of the barrier .    in the analysis",
    "presented above , the thermal diffusivity was assumed to be independent of temperature .",
    "we now relax this condition .",
    "we assume that the barrier @xmath99 is reduced by a much smaller amount corresponding to the measured transverse field , we set @xmath107 , and we allow @xmath14 to assume a temperature dependence that yields the best fit . the result of this alternate fitting procedure , shown in fig .",
    "[ fits ] ( b ) , yields a collapse that is acceptable within the experimental uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "remarkably , the latter method of analysis yields a thermal diffusivity that @xmath108 with increasing temperature approximately as @xmath109 .",
    "this form seems quite unphysical , as the thermal diffusivity normally decreases as the temperature is raised .",
    "we suggest that this unexpected behavior may be associated with a spin - phonon bottleneck .",
    "a number of experiments have provided evidence that a spin - phonon bottleneck strongly affects the spin dynamics and energy relaxation at low temperatures in molecular magnets such as v@xmath110 @xcite , fe@xmath111 @xcite and ni@xmath112 @xcite . in this process ,",
    "the zeeman energy generated by the reversing spins does not find a sufficient number of phonon modes at low temperatures to allow direct energy relaxation and equilibration , so that thermal equilibrium is established slowly while the energy is `` bottlenecked '' in the spin system .",
    "this bottleneck is lifted as the temperature increases , so that the number of available phonon modes increases and the energy is able to relax by direct spin - phonon processes .",
    "the effect of the bottleneck can find expression within our analysis as either a departure from arrhenius law behavior ( which we have assumed to be valid ) , or as an anomalous temperature dependence of the thermal diffusivity . within this scenario",
    ", @xmath14 would not display the same temperature dependence when obtained by the standard method of measurement where one determines the time of propagation of a heat pulse , since in this case the energy is deposited into the phonon system directly .",
    "we have presented the results of a thorough investigation in mn@xmath0-ac of the behavior of magnetic avalanches - the rapid reversal of magnetization that spreads through the crystal at subsonic speeds as a narrow interface between regions of opposite spin .",
    "a controlled set of measurements in which some parameters were held fixed while others were varied provided systematic information , enabling a rigorous comparison with the theory .",
    "two different methods were applied to fit data to the theory of magnetic deflagration of garanin and chudnovsky @xcite . in the first , we suggest that the internal transverse field produced by the avalanche front affects the speed of the front itself .",
    "we model this effect with a reduced barrier , @xmath99 , that varies with the size of the transverse field , @xmath62 , produced by the avalanche front . assuming a constant , temperature - independent thermal diffusivity , a reduced barrier @xmath99 allows a collapse of all the data onto a single curve . however , the transverse field measured at the front is not sufficiently strong to account for the large barrier reduction needed to obtain a good fit . a barrier reduction of this magnitude , if correct , defies a simple classical analysis and may be a signal that quantum effects are important in the deflagration process for all values of @xmath82 , not just those associated with the tunneling resonances @xcite .",
    "an alternative method of analysis that assumes a smaller barrier reduction commensurate with the measured values of transverse field yields a temperature dependent @xmath109 .",
    "we speculate that this rather surprising temperature dependence may be real and due to a phonon bottleneck that becomes less effective as the temperature is raised .",
    "to summarize , we find overall agreement between our measurements and the theory of magnetic deflagration of garanin and chudnovsky @xcite .",
    "however , detailed comparison yields either ( a ) a stronger reduction of the potential barrier than can be justified by the measured transverse fields ; or ( b ) a thermal diffusivity that unexpectedly increases with increasing temperature , perhaps due to a phonon bottleneck ; or ( c ) a combination of these ( and possibly other ) factors . further confirmation of the theory and a better understanding of the avalanche process , would be provided by a detailed theoretical analysis of bottleneck effects , and independent measurements of various parameters such as the flame temperature and the thermal diffusivity .",
