    "from recent observations , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are considered a favorite candidate for cold dark matter  @xcite . from the viewpoint of minimum supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ,",
    "the most well - motivated candidate for wimps in the universe is the lightest supersymmetric neutral particle ( lsp )  @xcite .",
    "one candidate for the lsp which is theoretically well - studied is the neutralino ( @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "the neutralino is a linear combination of supersymmetric particles that mix after electroweak - symmetry breaking .",
    "taking into account constraints from accelerator experiments and astronomical observations , the neutralino mass is expected to be in the range from several tens of gev to 10 tev , depending on the model assumed for susy breaking and on the susy parameters  @xcite .",
    "one method of searching for a wimp dark matter signal is an indirect search where decay or annihilation products from wimps are observed as originating from the center of a gravitational potential well such as a celestial body . wimps have a small but finite probability of elastic scattering with a nucleus . as matter is concentrated in deep gravitational potential wells ,",
    "this scattering is more likely to occur near the centers of such wells ; if their final velocities after the scattering are less than the escape velocity , they are trapped gravitationally and eventually accumulated in the center of the gravitational potential .",
    "there are two types of scattering : spin - dependent ( sd ) and spin - independent ( si ) scattering . in the former , wimps couple to the spin of the target nucleus , and in the latter wimps coherently scatter on the nucleus with probability scaling as the square of the mass of the target nucleus .",
    "wimps , being majorana particles , can annihilate in pairs , and produce primarily @xmath7 leptons , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks , gauge bosons , and higgs bosons depending upon their masses and compositions . at the final step , the decay of the wimp annihilation products may produce many kinds of particles such as neutrinos , positrons , antiprotons , antideuterons , etc .    in the sun , wimps are most likely to scatter on the dominant component , hydrogen , either via sd or si coupling .",
    "direct detection searches on earth turn out to have a sensitivity advantage , generally , for si interactions , while indirect searches apply to both  @xcite .",
    "wimp annihilation products in the form of muon - neutrinos are an excellent instrument for indirect searches since they can pass through the matter of the sun , and interact in the earth ; the resulting detected muon will be correlated with its parent neutrino direction , providing an unmistakable signal . in the past ,",
    "several neutrino telescopes such as super - kamiokande , amanda , and icecube have reported the results of indirect searches for wimps in the sun  @xcite . here",
    "we investigate upward - going muons ( upmus ) which are generated from high energy neutrinos come from the wimp annihilations using the super - kamiokande ( super - k , sk ) .",
    "we search in the direction of the sun , and an excess of neutrino flux above the atmospheric neutrino background is sought in the upmu events .",
    "although recent new detectors such as icecube have larger acceptances for higher mass wimps , sk is better equipped for the search of lower mass wimps ( @xmath11100 gev ) due to its lower energy threshold for neutrino signals .",
    "a previous wimp search in sk was done in 2004 using a dataset of 1679.6 days of through - going upmu events  @xcite . in this paper , we have nearly doubled the size of the dataset ( 3109.6 days ) . in addition , we have divided the upmu events into three categories , taking into account their neutrino energy dependence of detector response in order to improve the limit on the wimp - induced upmu flux and sd cross section , especially for lower mass wimps .",
    "this analysis also now uses wimpsim  @xcite and the darksusy  @xcite simulator in the calculation in order to simulate the wimp - induced neutrino fluxes and propagation .",
    "the sk detector is a 50-kton water cherenkov detector located at the kamioka mine in japan . since sk started operation in 1996 ,",
    "there have been four experimental phases : sk - i ( 1996 april2001 july ) , sk - ii ( 2002 october2005 october ) , sk - iii ( 2006 july2008 august ) , and sk - iv ( 2008 september ) .",
    "we use the datasets from sk - i to sk - iii ( 3109.6 days ) for this analysis .",
    "upmu events , which are categorized as the most energetic events in sk , are used for the analysis .",
    "muon neutrinos interact in the rock surrounding the detector to produce muons via charged current interactions .",
    "if the energy of the incoming neutrino is high enough , the muon produced by the neutrino will enter the detector and emit cherenkov light . to separate neutrino - induced muons from cosmic ray muons , we select only upmus , since the background from downward - going cosmic ray muons overwhelms any neutrino - induced muons from above . both the neutrino cross section and the range of the produced muon are proportional to the neutrino energy .",
    "thus , the effective target volume is very much increased if we use the upmu events for high energy neutrino searches .",
    "upmu events are divided into three categories : stopping , non - showering through - going , and showering through - going .",
    "if upmus stop in the detector , they are categorized as `` stopping . '' stopping upmus are the lowest energy portion of the upmu sample .",
    "upmus which fully traverse the detector are classified as `` through - going .",
    "'' the category of through - going is then further subdivided into `` showering '' ( if the event has accompanying radiation due to radiative energy loss ) and `` non - showering '' ( otherwise ) .",
    "the details of the showering versus non - showering classification scheme are described in  @xcite . showering through - going events",
    "make up the highest energy events in the upmu sample .",
    "the detector angular resolution is 1@xmath12 for stopping and non - showering through - going , and 1@xmath12.4 for showering through - going muons , as estimated by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "this analysis is based on a total of 4351 upmus : 919 stopping , 2901 non - showering through - going , and 531 showering through - going .",
    "the main background source for this analysis is upmu events produced by atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "these were simulated by the neut neutrino simulation package  @xcite and a geant - based detector simulator .",
    "we use the neutrino flux calculated by (  @xcite ; @xmath1310 tev ) and (  @xcite ; @xmath1410 tev ) for this simulation .",
    "the main uncertainty in the absolute number of upmus comes from the uncertainty in the cosmic ray flux ( @xmath15 ) . in this analysis ,",
    "this uncertainty is irrelevant since we normalize the absolute number of simulated atmospheric neutrino events by the number of upmu data events in each category .",
    "the effect of neutrino oscillation is also taken into account in the simulation .",
    "we consider @xmath16 oscillations with @xmath17 and @xmath18 independently obtained from the previous analyses  @xcite .",
    "the event distribution ( ski - iii:3109.6 days ) as a function of @xmath19 for each category of upmu is shown in figure  [ fig : coss ] . here , @xmath20 is the angle between the reconstructed upmu direction and the direction of the sun .",
    "this @xmath20 is called the `` cone half - angle . '' in figure  [ fig : coss ] , @xmath21 is defined as the direction of the sun . to compare data with the mc events , each mc event was assigned a time sampled from the observed upmu arrival time in order to match the livetime distribution and the detector acceptance of the observed events .",
    "the number of mc events is normalized to the total number of data events for each category . here",
    "the normalization was done for the entire @xmath19 region for simplicity . without signal regions",
    "the difference of normalization is less than 1% .",
    "we search for an excess from the direction of the sun in each of the three upmu categories : stopping ( a ) , non - showering ( b ) , and showering ( c ) .",
    "the fraction of each upmu category as a function of parent neutrino energy ( @xmath22 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : fraa ] . for typical energies of 10 , 100 , and 1000  gev ,",
    "they are : a : b : c = 0.73:0.20:0.07 , 0.10:0.62:0.28 , and 0.02:0.50:0.48 , respectively .",
    "these fractions were obtained from the atmospheric neutrino mc simulation .",
    "the fraction depends only on parent neutrino energy ; its source is irrelevant .",
    "we can roughly deduce the wimp mass from the event category where an excess is observed .",
    "since the spectrum of the atmospheric neutrino background is proportional to @xmath23 , while the signal spectrum from wimps gives a bump structure , this energy - dependent approach is good for reducing the atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "we separately analyze the three upmu samples , then combine the results by taking into account each fraction assuming a wimp mass .    since the directional correlation between neutrinos and their produced leptons depends on neutrino energy",
    ", it also depends on the wimp mass and its decay mode .",
    "therefore we look for a possible correlation of upmu direction to the sun by searching for an excess of events in various cone half - angles up to @xmath24 . using darksusy",
    ", we checked the neutrino - muon angular correlation for the neutrino spectrum generated by wimp annihilation in the sun for various susy parameters and found that the angle between the two is smaller than @xmath24 for most cases .",
    "the number of events observed in each cone half - angle toward the sun is shown in figure  [ fig : coseha ] .",
    "zero degrees corresponds to the direction of the sun .",
    "crosses indicate the data from ski - iii ( 3109.6 days ) and the histogram indicates atmospheric neutrino mc with same normalization as in figure  [ fig : coss ] .",
    "we calculate the upper limit of upmu flux from the direction of the sun with respect to the wimp mass . here",
    "we estimate the cone half - angles which contain more than 90% of the total number of upmus expected from wimp annihilations in the sun .",
    "we use the wimpsim package  @xcite , which simulates wimp annihilations , propagation of neutrinos from those annihilations , and the propagation of muons after neutrino interactions in the rock . in order to derive the expected neutrino spectrum from the wimp annihilation , we consider two cases : annihilation into @xmath25  ( soft channel ) , and annihilation into @xmath26  ( hard channel ) .",
    "these give the softest and hardest neutrino spectra , respectively .",
    "the cone half - angles obtained from these spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : shcone ] .",
    "the cone half - angle for the soft channel is generally wider at the same wimp mass since many neutrinos from annihilation via the soft channel are expected to have lower energy .",
    "the other smearing effects for angular correlation are muon propagation in the surrounding rocks , distribution of wimps in the sun , and angular resolution of upmu reconstruction .",
    "the smearing due to coulomb multiple scattering in the surrounding rocks is 2@xmath12 ",
    "3@xmath12 for muons with energy above 1 gev .",
    "the angular size of the sun at the earth is 0@xmath12.5 , which is negligible  @xcite .",
    "these two smearing effects were taken into account by wimpsim .",
    "the detector angular resolution of 1@xmath12 ( stopping and non - showering ) and 1@xmath12.4 ( showering ) are smaller than the smallest cone half angle and thus were not taken into account .",
    "we show the cone half - angle for several wimp masses in tables  [ tab : flim_sof ] and [ tab : flim_har ] .",
    "table  [ tab : flim_har ] begins at 80.3 gev since wimps with mass lower than 80.3 gev can not annihilate into @xmath26 .",
    "we followed the darksusy for the treatment of masses of standard model particles  @xcite .",
    "for each cone half - angle , which corresponds to a certain wimp mass in each annihilation channel , we calculated the upper poissonian limit of the upmu flux :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the detector cross - sectional area in the direction of the expected signal averaged over sun directions .",
    "for each position of the sun , this area is calculated using a minimal track length of 7 m in the inner detector as a criterion to select viable upmu trajectories .",
    "it varies from @xmath29 to @xmath30 with the position of the sun .",
    "@xmath31 is the experimental livetime and @xmath32 is the detection efficiency . for upmu samples ,",
    "the inefficiency of detection is negligible  @xcite .",
    "the average exposure @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the upper poissonian limit on the number of upmu events at 90% c.l .",
    ", given the number of observed events of each category ( @xmath36 ) , expected background of each category ( @xmath37 ) and fraction of each category ( @xmath38 ) where index @xmath39 corresponds three types of upmu category .",
    "this fraction is estimated from the neutrino spectrum of the given wimp mass for each annihilation channel and the fraction of the upmu categories as a function of the parent neutrino energy as shown in figure  [ fig : fraa ] .",
    "the neutrino spectra were simulated by wimpsim .",
    "figure  [ fig : sofspec ] shows the simulated neutrino spectra for the soft and hard annihilation channels , assuming a neutralino mass of 100 gev .",
    "@xmath35 was calculated combining all categories of upmu for a certain mass based on bayes theorem  @xcite .",
    "the poisson - based likelihood function for the expected signal is as follows :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the expected real signal . using the likelihood function in equation (  [ n90eq1 ] ) , the upper confidence level is written as    @xmath42    applying 90% as the c.l . in equation",
    "(  [ n90eq2 ] ) , the upper poissonian limit ( @xmath35 ) is obtained .",
    "the summaries of the numbers of upmu events and the estimated backgrounds for the cone half - angles which correspond to each wimp mass , @xmath35 , and the calculated flux limits are shown in tables [ tab : flim_sof ] and [ tab : flim_har ] .",
    "the 90% confidence level flux limits as a function of wimp mass are shown in figures  [ fig : flim_sof ] and [ fig : flim_har ] .",
    "results from other experiments , amanda  @xcite and icecube  @xcite , are also shown in these figures .",
    "the previous super - k result  @xcite is also shown in figure  [ fig : flim_sof ] , but please note that it was calculated assuming an annihilation branching ratio .",
    "that result assumed that 80% of the annihilation products were @xmath25 , 10% were @xmath43 , and 10% are @xmath44 , as a typical branching ratio .",
    "we can not regard this as a pure soft annihilation , but it is shown for reference .      from the upmu flux limits shown in figures  [ fig : flim_sof ] and [ fig : flim_har ] , we also calculate the upper limit on the sd scattering cross section of wimps .",
    "if we assume that the capture rate of wimps and the wimp annihilation rate are in equilibrium in the sun , the neutrino flux from annihilation depends only on the capture rate . since the age of the sun is much longer than the timescale of the annihilation , it is a safe assumption that they are in equilibrium .",
    "we can relate the upmu flux , @xmath45 , to the sd cross section , @xmath46 , on the assumption that only one annihilation channel is dominant and the si cross section is zero .",
    "the sd cross section , @xmath46 , can be written as  @xcite    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the conversion factor between the sd cross section and the muon flux .",
    "this value depends on the wimp mass , @xmath49 .",
    "we use the factor introduced in figure 3 of @xcite , which was calculated using darksusy .",
    "the calculated upper limit is shown in figure  [ fig : cross ] .",
    "also shown are results from direct detection experiments : dama / libra allowed region  @xcite , kims  @xcite , and picasso  @xcite ; and from neutrino telescopes : amanda  @xcite and icecube  @xcite .",
    "all of the limits from the neutrino telescopes ( including our limit ) are calculated by the same method described in @xcite . the previous limit from super - k",
    "is also shown for reference .",
    "note that the gaps at wimp masses of @xmath50 80  gev and 174  gev in this previous result are due to the thresholds of the @xmath26 and @xmath44 annihilation channels .",
    "these do not appear in the new result because we assume only one annihilation channel .",
    "our limit is improved at low wimp mass ( below 100 gev ) , which is stronger than limits from other indirect - detection experiments .",
    "our limit is also stronger than direct - detection experiments .",
    "we have performed an updated indirect search for wimps using the super - kamiokande data of ski - iii ( 3109.6 days ) .",
    "a wimp - induced neutrino signal was searched for in the direction of the sun .      to calculate the upmu flux limit",
    ", we used a new method involving wimpsim and the darksusy simulator .",
    "cone half - angles which contained more than 90% upmu signal for each wimp mass were extracted from simulation .",
    "upper upmu flux limits as a function of wimp mass for the soft and the hard annihilation channels were obtained .",
    "our limit extends into the region of expected upmu flux estimated by some susy models .",
    "an upper limit on the sd scattering cross section was also obtained .",
    "we used a wimp mass - dependent conversion factor as described in @xcite . at low wimp mass",
    "( below 100  gev ) our limit on the wimp - proton sd cross section is better than other experiments for both direct - detection and indirect - detection experiments .",
