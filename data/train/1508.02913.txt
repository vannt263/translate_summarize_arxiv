    "one of the major eukaryotic dna - protein binding motifs are those related to zinc fingers ( zf ) , the key protein family for the chromatin condensation as well as the gene regulation .",
    "there are around one thousand zf encoding genes @xcite and ten thousands highly conserved putative zf binding sites along the human genome @xcite .",
    "the majority of zf proteins assist transcription factors , acting as repressors , activators and regulators @xcite .",
    "they are responsible for the genome spacial structure in the dna loops too , exposing or hiding the genes , and work as an insulator , avoiding the spread of heterochromatin @xcite .",

    "however , the exact relation between the long - ranged correlation in genomic scale nucleotide sequences ( @xmath120 thousand bp ) and the chromosomal three - dimensional organization is still not clear @xcite and subject to intense research .",
    "furthermore , since transcription factors spot specific sequences without the opening of the double helix , we expect some biological mechanism for probing nucleotide based on local properties @xcite",
    ". to understand this there are two basic approaches : a polymeric description and by electric charges .",
    "the most common polymeric description considers dna as a single one - dimensional strand , explaining the dna denaturation semi - analytically @xcite .",
    "the literature also report the mechanical properties of chromosomal fibers and the long - range nucleotide interaction due to dna loops , histones and zinc finger proteins , using monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "since electrons play a crucial role in the dna - protein interaction , we must consider the dna from the electric charge distribution too .",
    "the electronic nature of dna is still in debate , but the literature point us some cues about their organization .",
    "the double helices behave as isolants or conductor under silver deposition @xcite , material contaminants @xcite and others environmental conditions @xcite . however , when the conductivity is measures in atmosphere , low vacuum or tris - hcl buffers , dna has semiconductor features with the typical gap between the valence and conductor band in the electronic density of states ( dos ) @xcite . in order to describe this behavior , ionization models ( also known as ballistic , polaron or wire - like charge transport )",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the parameters in ionization models are easily measured , since one just needs to evaluate the loss of energy when we takes one electron in a neutral molecule .",
    "the lost electron is usually in the highest occupied molecular orbital valence band ( homo ) and it may easily jump to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in the conductor band ( lumo ) .",
    "but , the literature also suggests electronic affinity models , where the energy is described by the gain of electrons in neutral molecule @xcite .",
    "these theoretical results usually combine density functional theory and molecular dynamic simulation .    in 2007",
    "zhu et al . joined both molecular ionization and affinity approaches @xcite .",
    "this adaptation of the peyra - bishop dna melting model @xcite describes the nucleotide sequence from their semi - conductor features , avoiding the heavy computational cost of _ ab initio _ molecular dynamical simulations .",
    "their work allowed to spot electronic local density of states ( ldos ) in one viral p5 promoter sequence , connecting ldos with one specific biological function @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they did not observe in their model the gap between homo and lumo in @xmath2 as one expects from the experimental data @xcite . in our work",
    "we fix the problem of homo - lumo gap , introducing the extended ladder in the model as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we also analyze systematically the dna - protein binding sites for two transcription factor proteins : the human specificity protein transcription factor 1 ( sp1 ) @xcite and early grown response factor ( egr1 , aka zif268 ) @xcite both localized in the promoter of a great variety of genes and characterized by a molecular structure called cys@xmath3his@xmath3 zinc finger ( zf ) .",

    "bomo clouds are over the first ( 5-ggg-3 ) and third triplets ( 5-ggg-3 ) of the consensus sequence , light green in table 2 .",

    "the second triplet is the binding site of the second zf of the early grown response protein 1 .",
    "the second electron is after the second triplet and is dispersed between the nucleotide position 7 to 15 , covering the third triplet .",

    "the homo and lumo electronic cloud is over the second electron .",
    "all @xmath52 in table 2 value @xmath53ev and the homo related electronic clouds have a length of 1 or 2 base pair .",
    "the lumo energies fluctuate with an average value of @xmath54ev .",
    "the lumo electronic cloud sizes vary from 1 to 6bp and they are in the position from 10 to 20 .    considering the homo and lumo distributions , we believe that they may play some role in sp1 and egr1 binding .",
    "these proteins bind dna , embracing the major grove of the double helix as guide . in the case of sp1 ,",
    "the head may interact with nucleotides between position -11 to -1 .",
    "the behavior for egr1 is more elusive because homo and lumo are completely disperse over the nucleotides 5 to 20 . despite the description emphasizing the similarity between the zf and nucleotide interaction in the literature over the consensus",
    "nucleotides @xcite , the mechanisms of protein attachment in egr 1 and sp1 are not the same @xcite .",
    "the homo and lumo electronic clouds are frequently overlapped , and the main reason for electrons of homo and lumo are always in adenine and thymine rich sequences is as follows .",
    "the electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital in the valence band should move to the nearby lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in the conductor band , when the system is disturbed . and",
    "the easiest way for this movement is placing the electron in regions with higher excitability , i.e. at rich domains .",
    "we may conjecture that this jump of the electron in the homo to the lumo has a unknown role in the transcriptor factor sp1 and egr1 .",
    "on the other hand , the less mobile electrons are those in the cg rich domain , since they are at the bottom of the dos .",
    "so , we expect to spot bomos in cg rich - sequences instead of at rich - regions as we see for @xmath38 with one @xmath55 in the position 32 , described in the previously . furthermore , these bomos are degenerated , i.e. all electrons present the same energy level .",
    "thus , these cytosine and guanine rich - regions , typical in promoters , are ideal landmarks for sp1 and egr1 binding sites .",
    "the absence o excitation in the lowest states is vital for zf transcription factors , because nucleotides with mobile electrons may change the position of the beginning of the gene reading , altering the gene expression .",
    "we are aware about the those eigenvalues between bomo and homo , but we still do not find any obvious pattern associated with sp1 and egr1 .",
    "we never observe overposition between the probabilities of bomos and the overlapped lumo - homo electronic clouds using the criteria of a minimum 10% of the localization probability of one particular electron at the samples in table 2 .",
    "the electronic probabilities @xmath41 of individual electrons , discussed in the previous section , are strand independent .",
    "however , the collective electronic probabilities @xmath44 and the field displacement @xmath16 depend of the strand .    when we have @xmath36 electrons , we fill only the valence band and usually observe in all analyzed sequences , table 2 , 100% of probability of electronic presence in purine ( adenine or guanine ) and the absence of an electron ( hole ) in pyrimidines ( thymine or cytosine ) in agreement with the dft analysis @xcite",
    "[ moabegr](i , j ) are the probabilities @xmath44 associated with finding one electron in one nucleotide for the maob sp1d and egr1 binding site sequences .",

    "they construct a dna walk using purine and pyrimidine as criteria for steps",
    ". then they report self - affine fractality in the walk , showing long - ranged correlation in the purine and pyrimidine distribution .",
    "when we look to figs .",
    "[ moabegr](i , j ) , purines and pyrimidines reflect the electronic distribution along the dna chain .",
    "this electronic distribution is related to bomo , homo and lumo distributions , which work as zf binding sites , for example .",
    "it is important to stress that they report a self - affine fractal , but not a self - similar fractal .",
    "the self - similarity is related to the palindromic sequences , connected with dna - loop structures as trna and rrna @xcite , while self - affinity is related to introns @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the evidence of polynomial long - ranged nucleotide interaction is also supported by @xcite . in this work",
    "the long contiguous sequences are represented by a sequence of 0 and 1 for noncoding and coding nucleotides , where noncoding nucleotides are intergenic regions and introns and coding nucleotides are genes and regions for metabolic controls .",
    "we made an auto - correlation analysis over the binary sequence and report correlation between two coding nucleotides at least 20 thousand bp distance apart .",
    "the existence of long - ranged correlations has another consequence in the model . the second term in eq . [ morse01 ]",

    "the stacking interaction will be relevant only if we consider @xmath62 , but such high experimental values for @xmath22 is unlike .",
    "this short - ranged element of the model comes from the dna melting problem , where the interstrands binding of the double helix may open @xcite . in this case , the short - ranged element is important , since it is easier to open the ddna when the neighbor bp is already open .",

    "but , we change the concept of @xmath16 to the @xmath0-orbital of the nucleotide .",
    "so , the short - ranged part in eq . [ morse01 ] is not longer relevant . in order to simplify the model ,",
    "one may suggest to eliminate the harmonic oscillator too in eq .",
    "[ morse01 ] . however , the harmonic oscillator is important for describing the stacking interaction in the langevin equation , eq.[selfconsist01 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the bending and the torsion of the double chain have influence over the dna chain @xcite , but this behavior can not be explained by eq .",
