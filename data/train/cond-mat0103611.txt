    "the dynamics of a quantum particle in a periodic potential in the presence of a uniform static magnetic field has revealed many beautiful effects and has been the subject of ongoing researches for several decades . the competition between the two characteristic length scales involved , namely the lattice period and the magnetic length produces a very complex pattern of energy levels . in two dimensions ,",
    "this leads to fractal structures in the spectrum anticipated by azbel@xcite , and further studied by hofstadter@xcite , claro and wannier@xcite , rammal@xcite , and many others .",
    "some striking experimental manifestations of these effects have been found in macroscopic properties of two - dimensional superconducting wire networks , such as the variation of the critical temperature with respect to the external magnetic field , the magnetization or the critical current .",
    "the connection between the linearized ginzburg - landau equations used to describe these wire networks close to the superconducting transition , and the tight - binding spectrum of electrons had been established slightly before these experiments by de gennes@xcite and alexander@xcite .",
    "more recently , a surprising effect has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in a two - dimensional lattice with hexagonal symmetry , the so - called @xmath0 lattice displayed in fig .",
    "[ star3lattice ] . for some values of the magnetic field corresponding to half a flux quantum per elementary tile ,",
    "the energy spectrum of a tight - binding model with nearest neighbor hopping collapses into three highly degenerate levels .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that it is possible to build energy eigenstates where the probability to find an electron is non vanishing only in a finite size cluster which we have called an aharonov - bohm cage .",
    "this corresponds to a localization mechanism due to quantum interferences of aharonov - bohm type between paths enclosing a half - integer number of flux quanta .",
    "for instance , if an electron is initially located on a given site of the lattice , it will never propagate beyond the boundary of the cage associated to this site , provided the magnetic field is chosen properly , as discussed above .    since this theoretical observation",
    ", several experiments have searched for manifestations of these cages on real systems .",
    "a serie of investigations on superconducting wire networks has been completed by abilio _",
    "et al._@xcite and by serret _",
    "et al._@xcite providing a good agreement between predictions and measurements of the critical temperature and the critical current .",
    "in addition , the unusual nature of the mixed state for half a flux quantum per elementary tile has been clearly indicated by a strong reduction of the critical current , and by magnetic decoration experiments which shows a very highly disordered vortex pattern@xcite .",
    "a slightly more direct probe of this localization effect has been provided by transport measurements in mesoscopic lattices carved in a two - dimensional electron gas at the interface of gaas / gaalas heterostructures@xcite . in theses",
    "systems , the number of tranverse conduction channels in the wires can be very small ( a few units ) , and the mean free path much larger than the distance between two nearest neighbor nodes . at intermediate magnetic fields ,",
    "naud _ et al .",
    "_ have clearly observed a periodic modulation of the magnetoconductance with a period of one flux quantum per plaquette ( @xmath1 ) . in the same experimental conditions",
    ", a square lattice does not show these oscillations .",
    "it seems more than plausible that these @xmath1-periodic oscillations seen on @xmath2 lattice could be attributed to the aharonov - bohm cages .",
    "indeed , this localization mechanism establishes a strong difference in the tranport properties between integer and half integer fluxes , which is expected to survive in the presence of a weak enough disorder as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these experiments clearly motivate us to address the question of the robustness of these cages in the presence of  real life \" perturbations such as disorder , finite size effects and electron - electron interactions .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to attempt to bridge the gap between the very idealized tight - binding model initially studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the experimental systems mentioned above . as a general trend",
    ", we will show that if the cages are in themselves very fragile , their existence in the ideal system induces a few remarkable features for the perturbed ones .",
    "the underlying reason for this is that these perturbations act on a very degenerate system , and as often in physics , degenerate perturbations are expected to induce some very interesting phenomena .",
    "one of the most famous example is , of course , the fractional quantum hall effect where the degeneracy of the kinetic energy at fractional filling factors opens the way to the formation of strongly correlated many - body exotic states such as the laughlin liquid@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ model ] presents a detailed discussion of the butterfly - like energy spectrum for a tight - binding model on the @xmath2 lattice .",
    "section [ cages ] focusses on half integer fluxes for which the cages appears .",
    "several viewpoints are given to provide a simple physical intuition of what happens in the system .",
    "this enables us to show other examples of lattices for which aharonov - bohm cages exist .",
    "section [ disorder ] discusses disorder effects still within the tight - binding framework .",
    "so , it is complementary to the previous study presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where the continuous wire model was analyzed , in connection to the experiments on two - dimensional gases . here",
    ", we investigate some properties of one particle eigenstates such as the inverse participation ratio as a function of the disorder strength and the magnetic field .",
    "section [ edges ] is devoted to edge states .",
    "these states are found to be confined in a finite width strip along the boundaries of the sample .",
    "we outline the subtleties involved in the translation from the tight - binding model properties to those of the continuous one - dimensional wire networks .",
    "finally , section [ interactions ] adresses interactions effects in the context of the hubbard model .",
    "most of the results deal with the two electron case . in agreement with a previous study for the chain of loops@xcite , we find that interactions are able to create some extended and dispersive two particle eigenstates .",
    "this can be viewed as a kind of interaction induced delocalization phenomenon , similar to the one discussed by shepelyansky for disordered systems@xcite .",
    "the presence of the cages in the non interacting case is reflected by the fact that these extended states involve a close binding of the two particles in real space , even if the local interaction is repulsive .",
    "we also give some ground state configurations for a finite density of particles and we show that the energy per particle has a singular behaviour when the number of electrons per site becomes larger than 1/3 . in the last section ,",
    "we conclude and discuss the experimental relevance of our work . technical details for the two interacting particles problem",
    "can be found in the appendix [ diago ] .",
    "we consider the @xmath2 lattice displayed in fig .",

    "when @xmath9 , the hopping term @xmath10 if @xmath8 and @xmath11 are nearest neighbors and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "in the presence of a magnetic field@xcite , @xmath13 is multiplied by a phase factor @xmath14 involving the vector potential @xmath15  : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the flux quantum . in the following , we focus on the case of a uniform magnetic field",
    "@xmath18 which can be obtained , for example , with the landau gauge @xmath19 , and we denote by @xmath20 the magnetic flux through an elementary rhombus .",
    "let us first briefly analyze the zero field case @xmath9 . in this case",

    "[ star3lattice ] ) , @xmath24 , and where @xmath25 is a wave vector lying in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the associated eigenstates are standard bloch waves . in addition",
    ", there is a non dispersive band at @xmath26 resulting from the bipartite character of the structure , and whose degeneracy is given by the difference between the number of 3-fold and 6-fold coordinated sites . since its origin is purely topological , this energy will always be an eigenvalue for any @xmath27 , with the same degeneracy . the density of states , originally computed by sutherland@xcite ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ dost3 ] .    for @xmath28 ,",
    "the spectrum is of course much more complex since there remains only one translational invariance along the @xmath29 direction due to the gauge choice , so that the eigenfunctions can be written as  : @xmath30 \\mbox{.}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the secular equations read  : @xmath32 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\psi_c(x - a)+\\psi_c\\left(x+{a\\over2}\\right)2\\cos\\left[{\\gamma\\over a } \\left(x+{a\\over4}\\right)+\\kappa\\right ] \\\\",

    "note that with the origin @xmath35 chosen in fig .",
    "[ star3lattice ] , @xmath36 only takes integer or half - integer values .",
    "if one looks for solutions @xmath37 of the secular system , one can substitute ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) in ( [ eq1 ] ) to obtain an effective one - dimensional equation that only involves six - fold coordinated sites  : @xmath38\\psi_{m+1}\\right .",

    "[ star3lattice ] , the six - fold coordinated sites form a triangular lattice so that eq .",
    "( [ spectre1d ] ) has to be compared to those derived by claro and wannier for the triangular lattice@xcite  : @xmath41 \\psi _ { m+1 } + 2\\cos \\left [ \\gamma _ { t}\\left (   m-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right ) + \\kappa \\right ] \\psi _ { m-1 } + 2\\cos ( 2\\gamma _ { t}m+2\\kappa ) \\psi _ { m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with similar notations .",
    "so , the @xmath2 lattice spectrum can be simply obtained from the triangular lattice spectrum by setting @xmath42 , since one has  : @xmath43 since the tiling is bipartite , the spectrum is symmetric ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "moreover , eq . ( @xmath45 ) displays a translation symmetry @xmath46 and a reflection invariance about half - integer values of @xmath47 .",
    "we thus limit our analysis to @xmath48 . for rational values of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 mutually prime ) ,",
    "the system ( @xmath45 ) becomes closed after a translation by @xmath51 periods and the spectrum is made up of @xmath52 bands .",
    "note that , when @xmath53 @xmath54 , this period is actually reduced by a factor @xmath55 and the spectrum has only @xmath56 bands . in particular , for @xmath57 , one can exactly compute the dispersion relation  : @xmath58 where @xmath59 \\times [ 0,\\pi]$ ] .",
    "for this flux , the spectrum spreads from @xmath60 to @xmath61 and is gapless .",
    "figure [ butterfly ] shows the @xmath2 lattice spectrum support versus the reduced flux @xmath47 .",
    "the most spectacular and unusual feature is that , for @xmath62 , the spectrum collapses into three eigenvalues @xmath63 and @xmath64 as it can be readily seen from eq .",
    "( [ homo ] ) .",
    "this is all the more curious that usually , for an infinite periodic structure and for rational values of @xmath47 , the spectrum is absolutely continuous ( band - like ) . here",
    ", it behaves as a _ super - atom _ with three infinitely degenerate levels with equal spectral weights @xmath65 .",
    "the existence of these non dispersive bands suggests the possibility to build wannier - type localized eigenstates .",
    "this remarkable fact is , for any electron density , susceptible to induce original physical properties reminiscent of those of a localized system .",
    "in this section , we shall analyze these properties from the quantum dynamics point of view by characterizing the spreading of a wave packet in the @xmath2 lattice , at @xmath62 . to achieve this ,",
    "it is worth focusing on the spectral charateristics at a local level .",
    "the magnetic field being uniform , the whole spectrum is indeed recovered from the local density of states ( ldos ) on the two different types of sites . at this point , it is more convenient to shift from the above landau gauge to a cylindrical ( symmetric ) gauge defined by @xmath66 that respects the discrete rotational symmetry existing locally .",
    "we proceed to an analytic lanczos tridiagonalization using the recursion method@xcite .",
    "the principle of this algorithm is to generate an semi - infinite chain according to the recursive relation  : @xmath67 which allows to evaluate the ldos on the initial orbital @xmath68 .",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal terms ( @xmath69,@xmath70 ) are obtained by requiring the normalization of the orbitals @xmath71 .",
    "note that in our case , all the diagonal elements @xmath69 vanish because  : ( _ i _ ) the structure is bipartite , ( _ ii _ ) @xmath72 is purely off - diagonal .",
    "let us first compute the recursion chain associated to a six - fold coordinated site and choose , as initial orbital , @xmath73 ( see fig  .[recursion6 ] ) .",
    "one has  : @xmath74 the first recursion orbital @xmath75 is a linear symmetric combination of the first shell sites ( three - fold coordinated grey sites ) . at the next step ,",
    "one obtains  : @xmath76    for @xmath62 , @xmath77 so that the ldos is reduced to two values @xmath78 with an equal spectral weight @xmath79 .",
    "this effect can be simply understood in terms of aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "indeed , the amplitude of probability @xmath80 to go for example ,  in two steps \" , from 0 to 9 _ via _ 2 , is exactly the opposite of @xmath81 , so that the resulting amplitude is zero .",
    "then , any wave packet initially localized on a six - fold coordinated site ( @xmath82 ) is completely trapped inside what we have called an aharonov - bohm cage@xcite whose precise definition is given below",
    ". one can easily determine its time evolution that is periodic and given by  : @xmath83 in particular , the autocorrelation function @xmath84 for @xmath62 , whereas for @xmath85  : @xmath86 ( @xmath87 stands for first brillouin zone ) and behaves at large @xmath88 as  : @xmath89 ^2 \\mbox { . } \\ ] ] we emphasize that for a generic rational @xmath90 , the hamiltonian is periodic and one expects @xmath91 .",
    "_ a contrario _",
    ", when @xmath47 is irrationnal , the hamiltonian is quasiperiodic and one expects , as for the square lattice @xcite , @xmath92 with @xmath93 since the spectrum should be singular continuous .",
    "the same type of recursion calculation can be made for the three - fold coordinated sites . in this case ,",
    "one easily obtains  : @xmath94 ^ 2 \\over 4 \\cos^2(\\pi f ) + 3 } \\mbox { , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath95 for @xmath62 , and the ldos on this type of site reduces to the @xmath26 ( spectral weight 1/2 ) , and @xmath96 ( spectral weight 1/4 ) .",
    "the quantum evolution of a wave packet initially localized on such a site is therefore , as previously , confined in a cage displayed in fig .",
    "[ recur3 ] that is larger than the one obtained for the 6-fold coordinated sites .",
    "finally , since the @xmath2 lattice is only made up of 6-fold and 3-fold coordinated sites , any wave packet ( with a finite initial extension ) will be confined inside a bound aharonov - bohm cage at @xmath62 .",
    "we emphasize that this localization phenomenon must be understood from the quantum dynamics point of view . indeed ,",
    "contrary to the anderson localization , the eigenstates of the system are not exponentially localized , and not even localized at all since the high degeneracy allows one to build any type of eigenstates ( possibly extended ) .",
    "+ to proceed further , it is necessary to give a precise definition of these aharonov - bohm cages . for a given wave packet @xmath97 submitted to a magnetic field characterized by a reduced flux @xmath47 , we define the aharonov - bohm cage @xmath98 as the set of sites visited by this initial wave packet during its evolution . in general",
    ", @xmath99 is infinite , but as shown previously , it can , for specific values of the magnetic field ( @xmath62 for the @xmath2 lattice ) , be bound . to analyze the cage structures for any independent electron model ,",
    "it is sufficient to characterize the cages of all inequivalent sites .",
    "indeed , the superposition principle implies that if @xmath100 , one has the following property  : @xmath101    with this definition , several cases can be encountered  :    * all cages are unbound for any @xmath47 ( ex  : square lattice , triangular lattice , honeycomb )  ; * some cages are bound for particular values of @xmath47 ( ex  : the penrose tiling and the octagonal tiling displayed in fig .",
    "[ penocto ] )  ; * all the cages are bound for the same values of @xmath47 ( ex  : @xmath0 lattice ) .",
    "this latter case , that we will call fully confined structure , can be met for other tilings . as an example",
    ", we have displayed in fig .",
    "[ star4lattice ] , the so - called @xmath102 lattice which can be obtained by deforming an approximant with @xmath103 sites per unit cell of the octagonal tiling .",
    "this structure has exactly the same physical properties as the @xmath0 lattice at @xmath62 ( @xmath47 refers here to the reduced flux measured in the smallest tile ) .",
    "thereafter , we shall consider a _",
    "light _ version of this tiling obtained by eliminating the sites @xmath104 and their related bonds ( see fig .  [ star4lattice ] ) .",
    "the resulting structure is simply a set of connected 8-fold symmetric stars with two different lengths whose ratio is equal to @xmath105 .",
    "we thus allow for two different hopping terms @xmath106 and @xmath107 for long and short edges respectively . for @xmath62",
    ", it is always possible to choose a gauge such that all the @xmath13 s are real .",
    "a possible choice is represented in fig .",
    "[ star4gauge ] .    note that this gauge has the same periodicity as the structure .",
    "this is quite surprising since it is not the generic case ( see next section for the @xmath2 lattice ) .",
    "it is then easy to diagonalize @xmath72 and to obtain the thirteen following eigenvalues  : 0 ( three - fold degenerate ) , @xmath108 ( two - fold degenerate ) , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . for any hopping terms @xmath111 these eigenvalues do not depend on any wave vector and thus form the exact analogous of the non dispersive bands obtained in the @xmath2 lattice .",
    "we would like to point out that fully confined systems can also be obtained in one dimension .",
    "we have shown in fig .  [ chap ] a quasi - one - dimensional structure that clearly displays bound aharonov - bohm cages at @xmath62 .",
    "its eigenspectrum is , as for the @xmath2 lattice , made up of three non dispersive bands with energies @xmath112 .",
    "after this detailed description of this magnetic field induced localization , it is natural to wonder if this phenomenon is robust to various type of  perturbations \" .",
    "for example , a non uniform magnetic field has been shown to drastically change the energy spectrum and the localization properties of the system providing a complete destruction of the cages@xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we study the effect of different kind of disorder and we show that , the destructive interference that leads to the aharonov - bohm cages are partially destroyed .",
    "a first natural way to introduce disorder in a system is to directly modify its structure by incorporating defects . in the case of the @xmath2 lattice ,",
    "such defects can be simply generated by a local _ elementary flip _ of three tiles as shown in fig .",
    "[ flip ] .    for @xmath62 ,",
    "it is clear that a finite number of flips does not modify the bound nature of the cages since , sooner or later , a given wave packet will be embedded in the  pure \" @xmath2 lattice geometry which is responsible of the confinement .",
    "nevertheless , one can wonder if this feature still holds for a finite density of such defects .",
    "indeed , if we consider a large number of flips in order to get closer and closer to a random tiling configuration@xcite , we expect the destructive aharonov - bohm interferences to completely disappear .",
    "it would be , in this case , interesting to determine the critical density below which all the cages remains bound .",
    "this could be achieved by considering an extended initial state and by computing its time evolution for different realizations of the disorder and for different flip densities .",
    "note that this value should be easily understood in terms of cages percolation threshold .",
    "+ another possible way to introduce disorder is to randomly modulate either off - diagonal or diagonal terms in the hamiltonian . in this study",
    ", we mainly focus on the latter case and consider the following hamiltonian  : @xmath113 where the @xmath13 are defined as in ( [ hamil ] ) , and where the on - site energies @xmath114 are mutually independent gaussian random variable with variance @xmath115 .    as the strength of disorder increases , the strongly localized cage eigenstates begin to spread over larger distances .",
    "in some sense , a weak disorder increases the one - particle localization typical length  ! however , since the system is two - dimensional , we expect the overall localization length to be finite for any value of @xmath116 and for any energy . for a given reduced flux @xmath47 , as @xmath117",
    "is increased from zero , the one - particle eigenstates first get mixed within the energy bands of the pure model .",
    "this regime corresponds to the standard anderson localization .",
    "this lasts until @xmath117 becomes of the order of some energy gaps allowing then for interband mixing .    for @xmath62 ,",
    "the remarkable structure of the spectrum at zero disorder is responsible for the absence of the first disorder induced localization regime .",
    "therefore , we expect , in this case , that most observables will depend only weakly on @xmath117 , as long as @xmath117 remains smaller than the gaps . to analyze this problem , it is interesting to construct an effective model in the lowest energy subspace of @xmath72 , expressed in the localized cage basis ( see fig .",
    "[ cagebasis ] in the next section ) . denoting the normalized cage eigenstates associated to @xmath118 centered around the six - fold coordinated sites @xmath119 by @xmath120",
    ", this effective hamiltonian has the form  : @xmath121 where @xmath122 stands for the sum over nearest neighbors in the triangular lattice generated by the the six - fold coordinated sites .",

    ", we use the indexation of fig .",
    "[ recursion6 ] so that  : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a gauge dependent phase factor",
    ". the general patterns for @xmath124 and @xmath123 can be easily inferred from these examples .",
    "we observe that @xmath128 involves both diagonal and off - diagonal disorder with comparable magnitude since  : @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "it is interesting to note that non vanishing tunneling amplitude from one cage to a neighboring one are induced by an asymmetry between the two diagonal energies of the intermediate 3-fold coordinated sites connecting the cage centers .",
    "according to this effective model , the statistical properties of the eigenstates and the energy levels are independent of @xmath117 , provided the eigenenergies are rescaled @xmath131 .",

    "finally , the strong disorder regime ( @xmath144 ) , where the localization length becomes comparable to the lattice spacing , is found not to depend sensitively of @xmath47 which sounds quite reasonable .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn by looking at the density of states .",
    "plots of this quantity at @xmath62 for various values of @xmath117 are shown in fig .",

    "it is therefore possible to perform the same decimation of the three fold - coordinated sites as for the tight - binding problem to obtain the same equation as eq .",
    "( [ spectre1d ] ) by setting @xmath165 .",
    "this simple correspondence between both problems also holds in the presence of a uniform magnetic field . in zero field , since @xmath166 runs from @xmath167 to @xmath168 , @xmath161 runs from @xmath169 to @xmath170 and therefore @xmath171 from @xmath164 $ ] .",
    "so , there is no gap in the free electron spectrum on the network .",
    "as soon as the magnetic field is present , @xmath171 has to be chosen from @xmath172 \\cup [ + \\delta / a,\\pi / a-\\delta / a]$ ] where @xmath173 , @xmath174 denoting the largest eigenvalue of @xmath72 at reduced flux @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the free electron spectrum exhibits an infinite number of non overlapping bands , for generic @xmath47 .",
    "gaps in the spectrum have two different origins.most of them corresponds to change the internal motion of the particle along a single link , which amounts to turn @xmath175 into @xmath176 .",
    "other gaps are induced by the magnetic field , and already appears as gaps in the set of allowed @xmath161 values ( @xmath161 spectrum ) .",
    "for the special value @xmath62 , the cage effect is manifested by the presence of a pure point - spectrum at energies @xmath177 , with @xmath178 .",
    "each of these levels is highly degenerate , reflecting all the possible cage states in the network .",
    "since some experiments have been performed on superconducting wire networks , it is worth recalling briefly the connection between the @xmath161 spectrum and the estimate of the superconducting critical temperature as a function of the external flux @xmath47 . at the transition ,",
    "the order parameter builds up from the propagating modes of the linear ginzburg - landau equation ( written here in zero field for simplicity ) along each wire@xcite  : @xmath179 the critical temperature is obtained from the largest value of @xmath180 denoted by @xmath181 , for which eigenvalues exist .",
    "@xmath181 is known as the ginzburg - landau macroscopic coherence length and we have @xmath182 . to determine @xmath181 , we follow the same procedure as for the free particle spectrum .",

    "this mapping has led to accurate comparisons between this simple model and the experimental data@xcite .",
    "however , for free boundaries system , such a simple correspondence no longer holds , since the coordination number can be different from 3 and 6 on the edges . for these reasons",
    ", our discussion of edge states will be given mostly in term of the linear problem ( [ lameq ] ) rather than in the tight - binding language .",
    "the main striking result is the appearance of very sharp edge states at @xmath62 .",
    "for those states , the amplitudes @xmath188 s are vanishing on most of the sites except on a finite width strip concentrated near the boundaries ( see in fig .  [ edgesfig ] ) .    for any shape of the boundary ,",
    "these edge states are always dispersive ( along the edges ) .",
    "note that in the tight - binding version , non dispersive edge states can also appear depending on the boundary shape .",
    "another qualitative difference is that , in the tight - binding problem , the energy of these states always appears inside the main gaps of the infinite lattice spectrum whereas in the wire network , the @xmath161 spectrum exhibits edge states with energy outside the bulk spectrum .",
    "we have displayed in fig .",
    "[ pap2 ] the spectrum of the finite lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ edgesfig ] and the infinite lattice spectrum .",
    "the dispersive edge states are clearly visible .",
    "these have important consequences for superconducting networks since they offer the possibility to nucleate superconductivity on the edges of the sample , at temperatures slightly above the bulk @xmath187@xcite .",
    "notice that for specific boundaries , the dispersive edge states can run all around the sample as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ edgesfig ] , providing possibly an interesting example of a non chiral ( quasi ) one - dimensional conductor .",

    ", we give an analytical expression for edge states ( @xmath161 spectrum ) coresponding to the semi - infinite @xmath2 network displayed in fig .",
    "[ semit3 ] . for these specific edges ,",
    "the only non vanishing amplitudes are @xmath189 and @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) .",

    "as previously discussed , these states are thus more favourable than the bulk states for the nucleation of superconducting regions in a wire network upon cooling from high temperature .",
    "we have also investigated how these very narrow edge states evolve as some perturbations away from the pure system at @xmath62 are gradually introduced . on fig .  [ away ]",

    "however , we observe a rather smooth evolution of these states as the strength of the perturbation is increased .    up to now",
    ", we have always consider that the electrons were independent . in the last section",
    ", we shall try to analyze the importance of the interactions between particles , in the @xmath0 lattice .",
    "note that for simpler systems , the two interacting particle problem under magnetic field has already revealed some unusual interesting features@xcite .",
    "of course , the many - body problem is certainly one of the most difficult to tackle . here",
    ", our goal is to study , in a simple approach , the effect of the electron - electron interactions on the aharonov - bohm cages .",
    "we underline that this type of system provides a good starting point to understand the competition between localization and interaction even if the nature of the confinement is due to the magnetic field and not to disorder . in our case ,",
    "the main departure from a realistic disordered model is indeed the preservation of the translation invariance in a localized system . in the following , we first focus on the two electron problem that already displays very interesting features , and we fix the reduced flux to its  critical value \" @xmath62 .",
    "the system is described by the following hubbard hamiltonian  : @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 denotes the creation and annihilation operator of a fermion with spin @xmath117 respectively , @xmath201 the density of spin @xmath117 fermion on site @xmath8 , and @xmath202 stands for nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "note that , since the particles considered here are fermions , the interaction term @xmath203 is only efficient in the singlet sector where the orbital part of the wave function is symmetric . for simplicity",
    ", we completely neglect the coupling between the magnetic field and the electron spin .    here",
    ", we shall mainly discuss the case of the @xmath2 lattice but we must mention the work presented in ref.@xcite on the chain of loops displayed in fig .",
    "[ chap ] . for this system",
    ", we have shown that a hubbard - like interaction term leads to a delocalization which is directly related to the emergence of dispersive bands in the two - particle spectrum .",
    "of course , such a study is much more complex in the @xmath2 lattice , but , as we shall see , it is however possible to show that the same effect is present in this two - dimensional structure .",
    "first , let us remark that if , at a given time , both electrons are far from each other , the local particle density is non vanishing in a cage that is simply the superposition of each individual cages .",
    "the interesting case thus arises when the electrons get close .",
    "we consider , for instance , an initial state where both electrons @xmath204 and @xmath205 are located on the same six - fold coordinated site , and compute the coefficients of the recursion chain for this two - particle wave function .",
    "with the site numbering given in fig .",
    "[ recursion6 ] , we denote this initial state by @xmath206 .",
    "more generally , a ket @xmath207 represents a state where the particle with spin @xmath204 is located on site @xmath8 and the particle with spin @xmath205 is located on site @xmath11 .",
    "note that we must , in principle , work with the symmetrized ket but , as shown below , since our initial ket @xmath208 is already symmetric , it will automatically generate symmetrized kets . applying the recursion algorithm in the gauge displayed in fig .",
    "[ recursion2e ] , one obtains  : @xmath209 since @xmath210 has a non vanishing amplitude on the second shell sites ( @xmath211 ) the two - particle wave packet can spread , so that the aharonov - bohm cages associated to @xmath212 seems to be unbound or , at least , larger than the one obtained for @xmath213 at @xmath214 . actually , we have checked numerically that the @xmath215 s are non vanishing so that the cage is really unbound .    as for the chain of loops , the propagation is made possible by the existence of two - body bound states in the spectrum . the same analysis as in ref.@xcite",
    "could be done in the @xmath2 lattice but the two - dimensional character of this later structure makes it more difficult . nevertheless , if one focuses on the small interaction case ( @xmath216 ) it is possible to show the emergence of dispersive bands near the ground state energy .",
    "indeed , one can , in this case , treat @xmath203 as a perturbation on the infinitely degenerate level @xmath217 without considering the higher energy levels .    to solve this problem",
    ", we shall use the periodic gauge displayed in fig .",
    "[ star3gauge ] that provides real hopping terms .",
    "remark that the periodicity of the structure has doubled and we must now distinguish two different types of 6-fold coordinated sites denoted by @xmath218 and @xmath219 . if one restricts the two - body problem analysis to the subspace corresponding to @xmath220 ( for @xmath214 ) , it is convenient to build the two - particle state basis as the tensor product of the one - particle orthogonal  cage \" basis displayed in fig .",
    "[ cagebasis ] .",
    "since the problem is invariant under a translation of the center of mass of the two particles , the basis of the singlet states sensitive to @xmath203 can be expressed in terms of the following bloch waves  : @xmath221 where the origin @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 are represented in fig .",
    "[ star3gauge ]  ; @xmath226 is the lattice generated by @xmath223 and @xmath227 with periodic boundary conditions and containing @xmath136 sites  ; @xmath228 is a wave vector lying in the first brillouin zone associated to @xmath226 .",
    "note that the orthogonal basis used here to define the different vectors is different than the basis used in section  [ cages ] . from now on ,",
    "the ket @xmath229 represents the normalized space symmetric state in which one electron is in a cage state ( eigenstate of the one - particle non interacting problem ) localized around a six - fold coordinated site located in @xmath119 and the other electron is in a cage state localized around a six - fold coordinated site located in @xmath230 . because of the pauli principle , these kets corresponds to antisymmetric spin wave functions and therefore to singlet states .",
    "note that @xmath231 is automatically symmetric so that we have omit the index @xmath232 for this state .",
    "naturally , if @xmath233 , the electrons do not interact so that one may only to consider the 8 two - particle states defined above .",
    "thus , in each irreducible representation indexed by @xmath234 , one just has to diagonalize @xmath235 in the subspace generated by these vectors .",
    "furthermore , as shown in the appendix  [ diago ] , @xmath235 can be block diagonalized into two isospectral matrices .",
    "after shifting the energies so that for @xmath214 the eigenenergies are equal to zero ( and not to @xmath220 ) , the eigenvalues ( in @xmath203 units ) are given by the roots of the following characteristic polynomial  : @xmath236 \\mbox{. } \\label{polynom}\\ ] ] @xmath237 + \\cos[{\\bf k}.{\\bf ( 2u - v } ) ]   + \\cos[{\\bf k}.{\\bf ( 2v - u } ) ] \\mbox{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] reminding that @xmath238 , one can easily check that @xmath239 is unchanged by the tranformation @xmath240 , as it obviously should .",
    "it is readily seen in eq.([polynom ] ) that @xmath241 is always an eigenvalue for all @xmath228 .",
    "the associated eigenvectors have a vanishing amplitude on the kets @xmath242 and @xmath243 that corresponds to states where both electrons are in the same cage .",
    "the absence of dispersion for this family of states suggests that they may be generated by a set localized two particle singlets .",
    "as in the one particle problem ( see section [ cages ] ) , it is even possible to exhibit such states where the center of mass is confined in a finite area .",
    "a possible choice is  : @xmath244 the presence of these localized singlet bound states at zero energy seems to be a particular feature of this lattice .",
    "apart from this non dispersive band , a close inspection of the polynomial @xmath239 allows one to show that when @xmath234 runs over an elementary cell of the reciprocal lattice , the roots of @xmath239 describe two separate dispersive bands spreading from 0 to 1/12 for the lower one and from 1/4 to 3/8 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are linear combinations of the 8 vectors introduced above and are actually extended bloch waves .",
    "these two - body bound states are delocalized and thus allow for a propagation of two - particle wave functions as we have already noticed using the recursion analysis ( see in fig .",
    "[ recursion2e ] ) .",
    "the same perturbative approach in the degenerate ground state can be achieved for the chain of loops@xcite . in this latter case , the spectrum , for @xmath245 consists in two non dispersive bands with eigenenergies 0 and 1/16 , and one dispersive band spreading also from @xmath246 to @xmath247 . here",
    "again these energies are measured in @xmath203 units and shifted such that , for @xmath214 , the two - body ground state corresponds to a zero energy .",
    "we have displayed in fig .",
    "[ spectrum2e ] these two spectra .",
    "two important differences arise between these two structures .",
    "first , there is no non dispersive singlet bound state at zero energy for the chain of loops , except the trivial ones involving two remote localized electron states .",
    "non dispersive singlet bound states do exist but their energy is strictly positive and depends on @xmath203 .",
    "second , there is a gap between the @xmath214 ground state and the first dispersive band ( bound state ) , by contrast to the @xmath2 lattice .",
    "the fact that all eigenenergies of the projected hamiltonian are positive is a simple consequence of the same property for the interacting part @xmath248 . denoting by @xmath249 the projector on the lowest energy level of @xmath72 , the lowest order degenerate perturbation theory proposed above amounts to diagonalize @xmath250 .",
    "for any two - particle eigenstate @xmath97 , we have @xmath251 to be positive ( or vanishing ) . from this consideration ,",
    "the appearance of non trivial ( degenerate ) zero energy bound states in the singlet sector is quite remarkable .    of course",
    ", it would be very interesting to characterize the properties of the system in the presence of a finite density of particles . in the following discussion",
    ", we shall always assume @xmath245 , so that we will only pay attention to the projected hamiltonian @xmath250 which is , as discussed above , a positive operator .",
    "denoting by @xmath252 the total number of electrons and by @xmath136 the total number of sites , we introduce the density @xmath253 that ranges from 0 to 2 because of the spin degeneracy . in the non interacting case , for @xmath254 , it is possible to put all the electrons , in the ground state of @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we will restrict our analysis to this interval .    for @xmath255 ,",
    "a possible choice for the ground state is to put each electron in a localized cage state ( around 6-fold coordinated sites ) . in this case , the energy per particle is simply @xmath256 . at low density , if all occupied cages are further isolated from each other ( no overlap ) , the interaction term @xmath248 does not affect these configurations which are therefore ground states of @xmath257 .",
    "these configurations have a huge spin degeneracy ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "one can also build ground state configurations containing some connected clusters of singly occupied cage states , provided these clusters are fully spin polarized .",
    "obviously , the total spins of these clusters may be chosen independently from each other without any energy cost .",
    "note that additional configurations with the same energy may also be obtained using the zero energy two particle localized singlet bound states discussed above .",
    "an interesting issue would be to determine whether this class of ground states exhausts all the possible ones , for @xmath255 . note that if the density @xmath259 lies beyond @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the site percolation density of the triangular lattice which is formed by the 6-fold coordinated sites , we have an infinite percolating cluster which leads to an infinite magnetization .    as @xmath259 approaches @xmath65",
    ", the ground state thus becomes more and more polarized .",
    "if @xmath136 denotes the total number of sites , the problem of finding the ground state of the projected hamiltonian becomes more interesting if @xmath262 .",
    "a simple class of eigenstates of @xmath263 is obtained if the magnetization is maximal .",
    "it corresponds to a total spin @xmath264 . indeed ,",
    "because of the spin rotation invariance , such states can be built from states with @xmath265 and @xmath266 after performing a global spin rotation .",
    "here , @xmath267 and @xmath268 denotes the total number of electrons with up and down spins respectively .",
    "the condition @xmath265 means that all the single particle ground states of @xmath72 are fully occupied by @xmath204 spin electrons . for these states ,",
    "the @xmath205 spin electrons behave as completely localized free fermions with an individual excitation energy equal to @xmath203 . to show this , we denote by @xmath269 the amplitude at site @xmath8 of the state @xmath270 which is the single particle cage eigenstates of @xmath72 localized around the six - fold coordinated site located at site @xmath119 , and we write  : @xmath271 with  : @xmath272 in expression ( [ hubbardbis ] ) ,",
    "the fermions operator @xmath273 and @xmath274 create and destroy an electron with spin @xmath117 in a state @xmath275 . on a state where all the single particle ground states of @xmath72 are fully occupied by up spins electrons , @xmath276 acts as @xmath277 times the identity operator .",
    "it is then easy to check that  : @xmath278 . as a consequence , for any state @xmath279 such that @xmath265",
    ", we have @xmath280 . at this stage ,",
    "it not clear whether the ground state of the projected hamiltonian has the maximal value @xmath281 of the total spin for @xmath262 .",
    "nevertheless , since this is true for @xmath282 according to the previous paragraph , this generalization is plausible .",
    "the main question to be adressed is whether a @xmath205 spin may form a bound state with one or several  magnons \" . by magnon",
    ", we refer here to particle - hole like excitations which destroy one @xmath204 spin electron and create one @xmath205 spin electron .",
    "we leave this interesting but more complex problem for future investigations .    to conclude this section",
    ", we may say that in spite of the presence of very low lying dispersive bound states for two particles , it is not so easy to turn the finite density system into a good conductor . however , we emphasize that some qualitative changes may arise for finite values of @xmath203 , since a sizeable virtual occupancy of excited levels of @xmath72 becomes then possible .",
    "in this paper , we have studied three types of perturbations which affect the physical properties of a two - dimensional lattice embedded in a magnetic field that presents aharonov - bohm cages .",
    "two of them , namely a weak anderson - like disorder and the finite size effects do not drastically modify the main features of the ideal model .",
    "in particular , if the disorder is not too important , the single particle energy eigenstates remain strongly localized for half - integer fluxes per elementary tile , and this independently of the disorder strength .",
    "this lasts until the disorder does not introduce a strong mixing between distinct degenerate levels of the unperturbed tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "by contrast , for generic values of the magnetic field , the amount of disorder - induced localization is very sensitive to the disorder strength .",
    "a more delicate situation is obtained in the presence of electron - electron interactions for the many - body system .",
    "we have shown how they partially destroy the single particle localization by the generation of extended two particle eigenstates . however , it is not clear at the present stage whether this mechanism is sufficient to induce a metallic behavior for finite electron densities and half a flux quantum per tile .",
    "this important question clearly deserves further investigations for the hubbard model ( studied here ) and also for more realistic model of continuous narrow wires ( few conducting channels ) , in connection to the experiments on two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "we expect to find partially spin polarized ground states in a finite interval of electron density , and a fully polarized state when the number of electron per site equals @xmath65 . for slightly larger densities",
    ", an important question is to understand if the system create some spin textures resembling to skyrmions in quantum hall effect for filling fractions close to odd integers .    in this context",
    ", it would be very interesting to study interacting hard core bosons on this lattice , which would require numerical diagonalization on finite size clusters .",
    "indeed , this model is closely related to the physics of josephson junction arrays . in the limit of small capacitance islands quantum fluctuations of the order parameter phase",
    "are strong and the corresponding trend to localize cooper pairs could be enhanced by the cage effect . in the other limit where the josephson coupling dominates ,",
    "it is not clear that the system at half - integer fluxes will develop a finite stiffness for spatial gradients of the order parameter phase . in this semi - classical regime",
    ", we expect a rather large ground state degeneracy as suggested by vortex decoration experiments on superconducting networks .",
