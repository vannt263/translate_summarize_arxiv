    "comprehensive wide angle surveys of the extragalactic hi sky became possible with the advent of multifeed front ",
    "end systems at l  band .",
    "the first such system with spectroscopic capability was installed on the 64  m parkes telescope in australia , and has produced the excellent results of the hipass survey ( barnes  2001 ) .",
    "the 1990s upgrade of the arecibo telescope , which replaced its line feeds with a gregorian subreflector system , made it possible for that telescope to host feed arrays , as proposed by kildal  ( 1993 ) .",
    "eventually a 7-beam radio `` camera '' , named alfa ( arecibo l  band feed array ) , became operational at arecibo , enabling large  scale mapping projects with the great sensitivity of the 305m telescope . a diverse set of mapping projects are now underway at that observatory , ranging from extragalactic hi line , to galactic line and continuum , to pulsar searches .",
    "alfalfa , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey , aims to map the peri and extragalactic hi emission over 7074  of the high galactic latitude sky .",
    "this will require a total of 4130 hours of telescope time . exploiting the large collecting area of the arecibo antenna and its relatively small beam size ( @xmath3 )",
    ", alfalfa will be eight times more sensitive than hipass with @xmath4four times better angular resolution .",
    "the combination of sensitivity and angular resolution allows dramatically improved ability in determining the position of hi sources , a detail of paramount importance in the identification of source counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , its spectral backend provides 3 times better spectral resolution ( 5.3  at @xmath5 ) and over 1.4 times more bandwidth .",
    "these advantages , in combination with a simple observing technique designed to yield excellent baseline characteristics , flux calibration and hi signal verification , offer new opportunities to explore the extragalactic hi sky .",
    "a comparison of alfalfa and other past and current hi surveys is given in table 1 .",
    "data taking for alfalfa was initiated in february 2005 , and , in the practical context of time allocation at a widely used , multidisciplinary national facility like arecibo , completion of the full survey is projected to require 6 years .    * the main science goals * to be addressed by alfalfa are :    * the determination and environmental variance of the hi mass function , especially at its faint end and its impact on the abundance of low mass halos * the global properties of hi selected galaxy samples * the large  scale structure characteristics of hi sources , their impact on the `` void problem '' and metallicity issues * provide a blind survey for hi tidal remnants and `` cold accretion '' * a direct characterization of the hi diameter function * investigate the low hi column density environment of disks * map and help elucidate the nature of hvcs around the milky way ( and beyond ? ) * the alfalfa survey area includes @xmath6 continuum sources with fluxes sufficiently large to make useful measurements of hi optical depth for dla absorbers at low z * alfalfa will double the number of known oh megamasers at intermediate redshifts    * the choice of survey parameters * for alfalfa is summarily justified by the following consideration . the minimum integration time per beam in seconds",
    "@xmath7 necessary for alfa to detect an hi source of hi mass @xmath8 , width @xmath9 , at a distance @xmath10 is @xmath11 where the exponent @xmath12 for @xmath13 and increases to @xmath14 for sources of larger width .",
    "this means that the depth of the survey , i.e. the maximum distance at which a given hi mass can be detected , increases only as @xmath15 : longer integrations than strictly necessary to achieve scientific goals lead to rapidly diminishing returns .",
    "a corollary of this scaling law is the fact that , once @xmath8 is detectable at an astrophysically satisfactory distance , it is more advantageous to maximize the survey solid angle than to increase the depth of the survey through longer dwell times . in passing ,",
    "we note that the @xmath7 required to detect a given @xmath8 at a given distance decreases as the 4th power of the telescope diameter : arecibo offers a tremendous advantage because of its huge primary reflector .",
    "a drift survey has many important advantages , especially at a telescope with properties which vary across the ( az , za ) space , such as the arecibo dish .",
    "a double  drift survey offers all  important additional advantages in terms of rfi excision .",
    "the effective integration time per beam area of a double  drift survey with alfa is of order of 40 sec .",
    "this translates to a minimum detectable hi mass of @xmath16 @xmath1 at the distance of the virgo cluster and in a catalog of sources with a median @xmath17 .    *",
    "the sky coverage of alfalfa * includes the region from 0@xmath18 to + 36@xmath18 in declination and from @xmath19r.a.@xmath20 ( the `` fall sky '' ) and @xmath21r.a.@xmath22 ( the `` spring sky '' ) , as illustrated in figure [ skycov ] .",
    "observations are carried out in drift mode , and each region of the sky is visited at two different epochs , separated by a few months of earth s orbital phase .",
    "no `` tracking l.o . '' is applied to data taking .",
    "this fixed azimuth , `` minimum intrusion '' observing technique delivers high data quality and extremely high observing efficiency .",
    "because of its wide areal coverage and photometric accuracy , alfalfa is providing a legacy dataset for the astronomical community at large , serving as the basis for numerous studies of the local extragalactic universe .",
    "as of mid2007 , 44% of the survey solid angle has been fully mapped .",
    "further details on the design and progress of the survey can be seen in giovanelli ( 2005a ) , the presentation by martin  in these proceedings and at the url _",
    "http://egg.astro.cornell.edu / alfalfa_.    * alfalfa is an open collaboration*. anybody with a legitimate scientific interest and willing to participate in the development of the survey can join .",
    "as of mid 2007 , 68 individuals are participating in the alfalfa observations , processing or follow  up activities .",
    "up activities include : hi synthesis and single dish high sensitivity observations ; radio observations at other wavelength bands than hi ; optical imaging in broad band and h@xmath23 and for distance determination ; optical spectroscopy for redshift confirmation , h@xmath23 rotation curve mapping and metallicity determination ; infrared and uv imaging .",

    "two catalogs of hi sources extracted from 3-d spectral data cubes have been submitted for publication in the first half of 2007 , the first ( giovanelli  2007 ) for the spring sky , the second ( saintonge  2007 ) for the fall sky . in the first catalog ,",

    "the quality of the alfalfa signal extraction is apparent : the s / n of detections exhibits no significant bias with respect to velocity width .",
    "spectroscopic hi surveys are not single flux limited .",
    "the flux limit is expected to rise as @xmath47 for low velocity widths , changing to a linear rise for the wider line profiles .",
    "such a transition is observed near @xmath48 .",
    "the alfalfa flux limit is @xmath49 jy  for narrow lines , rising near 1 jy  for the broadest ones .",
    "the positional accuracy of hi sources is a very important survey parameter , especially in the identification of hi sources with sources at other wavelengths , as stressed by disney ( these proceedings ) .",
    "the quality of the positional centroiding of a source depends roughly linearly on source",
    "s / n and inversely on the telescope beam angular size .",
    "consider , for example , a source barely detected by hipass at s / n@xmath50 .",
    "the error box of its positioning will have a radius of approximately 2.5. the same source can be detected by alfalfa with @xmath51 ; as the arecibo beam is about 4 times smaller than that of parkes , the positional error box for the alfalfa observation is @xmath52 , making an optical identification , for example , far more reliable .",
    "positional accuracy of alfalfa sources averages 24  ( 20  median ) for all sources with s / n @xmath36 6.5 and is @xmath417  ( 14  median ) for signals s / n @xmath36 12 .",
    "what should we refer to as a `` dark galaxy '' ( perhaps a misnomer ) ? within the framework of this symposium , a dark galaxy would be a starless halo , yet detectable at other than optical wavelengths , possibly in hi or through lensing experiments .",
    "such objects are likely to exist , but hard to find . within the cdm galaxy formation paradigm",
    ", such objects would have relatively low mass , were unable to form stars before re  ionization and either lost their baryons or were prevented from cooling them thereafter , by the ig ionizing flux ( see presentations by hoeft and by yepes , these proceedings ) .",
    "yet we know of low mass galaxies in the local group which not only made stars early on , presumably before re  ionization , but they were also capable of retaining cold gas and make stars at later cosmic times .",
    "why then should we not expect the existence of low mass systems that were unable to form stars but have retained baryons and have been able to cool them , as the ig ionizing flux rarefies ?",
    "we have extremely little observational evidence for the existence of such systems . in my view , the best `` historical '' example for a `` dark galaxy '' is the sw component of the system hi1225 + 01 discovered by giovanelli & haynes ( 1989 ) .",
    "[ hi1225 ] is a zero - th moment vla hi map of the system , by chengalur , giovanelli & haynes ( 1995 ) .",
    "the ne component has an optical counterpart near its center .",
    "the sw component , however , does not : it exhibits evidence of rotation @xmath53 , a total mass near @xmath54 m@xmath55 within a 3 ( @xmath56 kpc ) radius and @xmath57 .",
    "however , it is not an isolated object and it can not be excluded that it originated from a high speed tidal encounter of the ne component with a now remote passer  by , as the system lies in the outskirts of the virgo cluster .",
    "the burden on observers is that of finding isolated systems resembling hi1225 + 01sw .",
    "see kent s presentation ( these proceedings ) for possible candidates .",
    "the bottom line is that , with the exception of systems found in the periphery of the virgo cluster , alfalfa has not unambiguously discovered any such system , so far .",
    "a candidate `` dark galaxy '' was discovered and dubbed `` virgohi21 '' ( minchin  2007 and refs therein and these proceedings ) .",
    "the discovery at jodrell bank was corroborated by arecibo and wsrt observations .",
    "virgohi21 lies some 100 kpc n of ngc4254 , in the nw periphery of the virgo cluster , projected @xmath58 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "alfalfa also detects it , but the alfalfa data strongly suggests a different interpretation for the nature of virgohi21 . fig .",
    "[ n4254 ] ( left ) displays contours of hi flux of alfalfa data , superimposed on an optical image , showing a gas streamer extending some 250 kpc n of ngc 4254 .",
    "the velocity field of the stream , which matches the velocity of ngc4254 to the s , is shown on the right hand side panel of the figure .",
    "virgohi21 is the bright section of the hi stream extending from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "the hi mass in the disk of the galaxy is @xmath61 m@xmath55 and that associated with the stream is @xmath62 m@xmath55 .",
    "one of the driving arguments for minchin s interpretation of virgohi21 as an isolated disk galaxy is the gradient seen in the velocity field ; alfalfa data shows that gradient to be just a part of the varying , large  scale velocity field along the stream .",
    "ngc 4254 is a system well known for its prominent @xmath63 southern spiral arm .",
    "it is reasonable to postulate that this special feature is related with the existence of the stream .",
    "note the following :    * ngc 4254 moves at a large velocity with respect to the cluster ( @xmath64 ) and lies at a projected distance of @xmath4 1 mpc from m87 . *",
    "the prominent m=1 arm is visible in the gas and in the disk stellar population : gravity , rather than hydro phenomena such as ram pressure , is at work . *",
    "the hi mass in the stream is only @xmath65% of that in the ngc 4254 disk : the disturbance of ngc 4254 is relatively mild ( it would not , in fact be classified as an hi deficient galaxy ) . *",
    "the velocity field of the stream shows the coupling of the tidal force and the rotation of ngc 4254 , which suggests an iinteresting timing argument : 1 .",
    "the stream exhibits memory of a full rotational cycle of the ngc 4254 disk ; 2 .   from the ngc 4254 vla map of phookum , vogel and mundy ( 1993 )",
    ", we can get the present outer radius of the hi disk ( 18.5 kpc ) and the rotational velocity at that radius ( 150 ) ; from those we compute a rotation period of @xmath66 myr .",
    "* hence we estimate that the tidal encounter which gave rise to the stream initiated some 800 myr ago , a time comparable with the cluster crossing time .",
    "we conclude that the most reasonable interpretation of the system is that of a relatively mild episode of harassment , resulting from the high speed passage of ngc 4254 through the cluster periphery .",
    "these results are discussed in greater detail in haynes , giovanelli and kent ( 2007 ) .    in these proceedings ,",
    "duc ( see also duc & bournaud 2007 ) presents the results of a simulation of a high speed encounter of ngc 4254 with another peripheral cluster galaxy .",
    "the simulation matches extremely well both the morphology and the velocity field of the stream .",
    "the culprit responsible for the harassment of ngc 4254 could now be located some 400 kpc to nw of ngc 4254 .",
    "duc & bournaud speculate that , given its location and velocity , the culprit could be m 98 = ngc 4192 .",
    "alfalfa finds an extended hi appendage apparently emanating from that galaxy , as is briefly discussed in the next section .",
    "the overall evidence for virgohi21 to be part of the phenomenology associated with a tidal episode of harassment , rather than an isolated `` dark galaxy '' is thus quite strong .",
    "as shown in the presentation by kent , these proceedings , alfalfa finds a number of hi features lacking an obvious optical counterpart .",
    "one important characteristic is in common with such systems found by alfalfa : they appear to preponderantly be found in the virgo cluster region . in addition ,",
    "several of the systems share similarities with the ngc 4254 system : hi streams associated with disturbed galaxies , extending a few to several hundred kpc , suggesting that their origin is possibly related to high speed encounters . in this section , a brief report is given on two additional such systems .    * the ngc 4532/ddo 137 pair * is located in the southern part of the virgo cluster . using arecibo ,",
    "hoffman  ( 1993 ) first discovered evidence that significant amounts of hi is present outside the galaxies disks .",
    "this result was confirmed by vla observations of the system ( hoffman  1999 ) , showing numerous shreds of intergalactic hi spread over tens of kpc from the optical galaxies .",
    "r. koopmann ( these proceedings ) has recently discovered a complex hi stream system extending from the galaxy pair to the s , over more than @xmath67 ( @xmath68 kpc ) , with numerous knots which are potential sites for the formation of tidal dwarfs .    *",
    "ngc 4192 = m 98 * is a galaxy located in the nw periphery of the virgo cluster , with a negative heliocentric velocity ( -142 ) indicative of large relative motion with respect to the cluster itself .",
    "a number of hi clouds with velocities between 60 and 100  are found in its vicinity , spectrally well separated from milky way emission .",
    "they would typically be cataloged as high ( or intermediate ) velocity clouds , perigalactic ( or local group ) dwellers , and most of them may very well be just that .",
    "some of the clouds , however , appear to stream out of m 98 , stretching over more than @xmath69 , well matched both spatially and kinematically to the disk of m 98 .",
    "the characteristics of this system are under close scrutiny .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that  as mentioned in the preceding section  , duc & bournaud suggest that m 98 may be the culprit responsible for the harassment of ngc 4254 , observed in the form of the stream virgohi21 is a part of .",
    "alfalfa , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey , is well underway . designed to map @xmath70 sq . deg . of high galactic latitude sky in the hi line , observations for alfalfa are 44% complete as of mid2007 .",
    "the first source catalog has been released and others are in preparation .",
    "survey products are being placed in the public domain and accessible through nvo compatible software tools .",
    "the fully processed data are delivering an average detection rate of @xmath71 sources deg@xmath72 , with peaks 1020 times higher in high density regions such as group and cluster peripheries .",
    "the positional accuracy of the alfalfa hi sources is quite high , allowing unambiguous identification of @xmath73% of them with optical counterparts .",
    "the median @xmath74 is 7800 , yielding sampling of a fair cosmic volume .",
    "very few hi sources are not associated with optical counterparts .",
    "those which are not generally appear as parts of tidal streams or otherwise generated appendages of known optical galaxies .",
    "the most dramatic examples of such objects in the sets of alfalfa data examined so far are found in the vicinity of the virgo cluster .",
    "of particularly current interest is the stream connected to ngc 4254 , which icludes virgohi21 .",
    "alfalfa data strongly favor the interpretation that virgohi21 is part of a tidal feature that resulted from a high speed encounter , rather than a _ bona fide _ dark galaxy .",
