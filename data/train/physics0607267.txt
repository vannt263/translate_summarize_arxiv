    "the polymer becomes more stretched and aligned with the force , decreasing the effect of the bend . for a classical elastic rod where thermal fluctuations are a weak perturbation",
    "the characteristic propagation length of elastic deformations is @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , as the force increases , the region of the chain experiencing a significant deflection due to the bend drops . by this argument , one might expect that the largest change in extension due to the bend will occur for the lowest values of the applied force .",

    "this mathematical description of a bend is suitable both for a bend with a single angle and for bends with a distribution of different bend angles .",
    "we demonstrate that the change in polymer end - to - end extension induced by the bend can be a significant fraction of the polymer persistence length : @xmath120 for bend angles of 90 - 180@xmath121 , or @xmath122 nm for dsdna , which has persistence length of approximately 50 nm .",
    "the change in extension due to the bend is predicted to show a maximum for applied force around 0.1 pn ; for larger force the polymer conformation becomes highly extended and the influence of the bend decreases , while for low force the polymer extension approaches zero , independent of the presence of the bend .",
    "the alterations in polymer extension induced by the bend should be detectable in high - resolution single - molecule experiments . since recent work in single - molecule optical trapping with",
