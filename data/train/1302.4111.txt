    "<S> these conformational changes have been suggested to follow an induced - fit mechanism in which the molecules first bind in the open conformation in those cases where binding in the closed conformation appears to be sterically obstructed such as for the hiv-1 protease . in this article , we present a general model for the catalysis and inhibition of enzymes with induced - fit binding mechanism . </S>",

    "<S> based on these expressions , we analyze the effect of mutations that mainly shift the conformational equilibrium on catalysis and inhibition . </S>",
    "<S> if the overall catalytic rate is limited by product unbinding , we find that mutations that destabilize the closed conformation relative to the open conformation increase the catalytic rate in the presence of inhibitors by a factor @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mutation - induced shift of the free - energy difference between the conformations . </S>",
    "<S> this increase in the catalytic rate due to changes in the conformational equilibrium is independent of the inhibitor molecule and , thus , may help to understand how non - active - site mutations can contribute to the multi - drug - resistance that has been observed for the hiv-1 protease . </S>",
