    "for many years , adaptive estimation procedures have stimulated the statistical interest .",
    "such estimates achieve minimax convergence rates relying on very little prior knowledge about the properties of the curves to be estimated .",
    "oracle inequalities fit into this framework , but give much more precise information about the performance of an estimate .",
    "they compare the risk of an adaptive candidate not to the minimax , but to the best possible risk .",
    "oracle inequalities have been proposed for a variety of problems and estimator , kneip ( 1994 ) and donoho , johnstone ( 1994 ) presumably being the first papers to state some .",
    "more recent examples are hall , kerkyacharian , picard ( 1999 ) , cavalier , tsybakov ( 2001 ) , cay ( 2003 ) , efromovich ( 2004 ) .    in the following",
    "we will consider oracle inequalities in density estimation , and it was wavelet estimators that have received the main attention in this context . during the 90 s , authors like donoho ,",
    "johnstone , hall , kerkyacharian and picard developed various estimation techniques that satisfied more and more refined oracle inequalities .",
    "efromovich also examined fourier series estimates .",
    "of course , even the case of data controlled bandwidth selection investigated in the 80 s , can be regarded as kind of an oracle problem .",
    "but the only source for a more general oracle inequality for a kernel density estimator is rigollet ( 2004 ) .",
    "remarkably , unlike the other oracle inequalities on density estimators , rigollet s is an exact one .",
    "our contribution gives another exact oracle inequality for kernel density estimation , but the two do not cover one another in neither direction .",
    "rigollet s application of stein s blockwise estimator to non - parametric density estimation is a sharp minimax - adaptive kernel selection rule .",
    "the procedure approximates the so - called _ monotone oracle _ by the use of kernel functions with piecewise constant fourier transform .",
    "the monotone oracle is a pseudo - estimator , which minimizes the quadratic risk ( mise ) over the class of all kernel functions , whose fourier transform is real , symmetric and decreases monotonously on @xmath0    when considering the concept of curve smoothing from the viewpoint of signal recognition , a monotone fourier transform appears to be a natural assumption to a kernel .",
    "given that the unknown density is square - integrable , it is equivalent with respect to mise either to estimate the density itself or to reconstruct it from an estimate of its fourier transform .",
    "on the other hand it is known that with increasing frequency , random influences overbalance the true value in the empirical fourier transform . for this reason ,",
    "the fourier series projection estimator omits empirical fourier coefficients beyond a critical frequency . in the famous pinsker - filter ,",
    "the rigid cut - off is weakened to a monotone shrinkage of the unreliable coefficients by the pinsker - wheights .",
    "the focus on kernels with monotonously decreasing , but otherwise arbitrary fourier transform is just a further generalization of the this notion .",
    "the objective of the present work is to propose a purely data dependent estimator that approximates the monotone oracle in an exact oracle inequality . in comparison to rigollet ( 2004 )",
    ", we abandon the assumption of the kernel s piecewise constant fourier transform , our kernels only being band - limited to @xmath1 $ ] and having a monotone fourier transform .",
    "asymptotic exact mise - efficiency is shown to hold over the set of all bounded , @xmath2-integrable densities , which are not infinitely differenciable .",
    "sharp asymptotic minimax - adaptivity on the whole scale of sobolev spaces with smoothness index greater than 1/2 follows automatically .",
    "there are essentially two quantities to determine the statement of an oracle inequality : the set of estimators disposable to the minimization of risk ; and the set of true parameters , over which the oracle inequality is supposed to hold .",
    "evidently , the larger these sets , the stronger the oracle inequality . in a non - parametric",
    "setting , regularity conditions are the natural way to specify the space of parameters",
    ". classes of estimators considered have been quite diverse and cover many familiar non - parametric estimation methods .",
    "however , all the classes , for which oracle inequalities were proven so far , share an important property  whether fixed or growing with the number of observations ,",
    "their dimension is finite .",
    "this is natural , when dealing with wavelet or fourier coefficients .",
    "in ordered linear smoothers and blockwise stein s method , the assumptions `` ordered '' and `` blockwise '' , respectively , assure the finite dimensionality . for penalized least squars estimators , the dimension is always explicitly determined .",
    "note that oracle inequalities rely on special concentration inequalities , because it is necessary to approximate the maximum of an empirical process indexed by a class of functions ; functional limit theorems are imperative . with finite dimension",
    "we have access to the uniform entropy of the estimator class and chaining arguments provide us with a suitable bound for the process .",
    "yet these approximations unavoidably contain the factor dimension in one way or another .",
    "estimators indexed by kernels with monotone fourier transform is a class that has obviously not finite dimension .",
    "but it is known that the set of monotone functions also allows for an approximation of its uniform covering number .",
    "unfortunately , the approximations do not carry over from the fourier to the space domain . and so the chaining approach is obstructed to us .    instead",
    ", we pursue an alternative way to approximate our empirical process , namely an additive decomposition .",
    "the process , indexed by the class of kernels , is decomposed into a linear combination of countably many basis processes .",
    "separate arguments as regards the basis processes ( exponential inequalities ) and the size of the non - random coefficients are combined .",
    "the resulting threshold is equivalent to those in finite dimensional model classes , except that the factor containing the dimension is replaced by @xmath3 .    for an outline of the exact procedure , see section 4 , appendix a1 and a2 .",
    "the theorem along with the hypothesis is formulated in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains the proof of the theorem relying on the proposition that the empirical process can be bounded to an appropriate magnitude .",
    "some practical considerations will be found in section 5 .",

    "this splitting was already observed in stone ( 1984 ) , where the class of kernels consists but of one rescaled kernel function : @xmath78 .",
