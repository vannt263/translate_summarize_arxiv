    "the electromagnetic properties of spin-1 particles ( @xmath3 ) can help us to understand the symmetry structure and interactions of the fundamental particles .",
    "for example , considering @xmath3 as a stable state , the electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 gauge boson are predicted by the symmetry structure of the standard model , while for the @xmath1 meson several predictions exist , based on effective models of the strong interaction binding the quarks @xcite , and from lattice - qcd @xcite .",
    "however , they are not stable states . therefore , in order to draw definite conclusions , a complete study of the _ additional _ effects due to their instability is mandatory .    the proper theoretical description of such states requires to incorporate their unstable features ( parameterized by their finite decay width , @xmath4 ) in an electromagnetic gauge invariant way . to do so ,",
    "several schemes have been developed , we can mention , for example , the so called fermion loop scheme @xcite and the boson loop scheme @xcite ( suitable for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons respectively ) , which consider that @xmath4 is naturally included in the calculations by taking into account the absortive contributions in the electromagnetic vertex and in the propagator . under these schemes ,",
    "the electromagnetic vertex @xmath5 is modified respect to the tree level form in a non - trivial way .",
    "this implies that the electromagnetic structure itself suffers modifications .    in the present work we analyze the most general results for the electromagnetic vertices obtained in the loop schemes , which include the mass of the particles in the loops , and extract the expressions for the modified form factors .",
    "in order to exhibit the size of the corrections due to the unstable nature of the particles , we compare our results for the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) and electric quadrupole moments of the @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 mesons with others computed in the literature for contributions from different nature .",
    "the gauge invariance requirement , along with the modification in the propagator inherent to the schemes , allows to identify the proper complex renormalization factor of the vector field , which keep the electric charge free of radiative correction contributions .",
    "the schemes developed in @xcite for the introduction of the finite width effects , while keeping electromagnetic gauge invariance , are based in two main observations : in quantum field theory the width is naturally included in the imaginary part of the self - energy of the particles and , the ward identity is respected at all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "these facts are exploited in those schemes by including the resummation of the fermion / boson loops in the propagator and the corrections in the electromagnetic vertices .",
    "then , the imaginary part of the fermion / boson loops introduces the tree level width in the gauge boson propagator and , the gauge invariance is not violated since the fermion / boson loops obey the ward identity order by order .    at tree level",
    ", the propagator for a vector boson of mass @xmath7 can be set as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are the transversal and longitudinal projectors , respectively .",
    "the vertex for the process @xmath11 is defined from the electromagnetic current @xmath12 at tree level , the vertex can be set as that given by the standard model for the @xmath0 boson : @xmath13 these expressions satisfy the ward identity @xmath14 ^{-1 } - \\left [ \\imath d_0^{\\nu \\lambda } ( q_2 ) \\right ] ^{-1 } ; \\label{wardide}\\ ] ]    upon the inclusion of the finite width of the boson , by considering the loop contributions , the propagator is modified in a generic form as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are the transverse and longitudinal part of the absortive contribution of the self - energy induced by the particles in the loop . similarly , the vertex becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 contains the loop corrections .",
    "the ward identity relates the loop contributions by requiring to satisfy @xmath20    for a boson like the @xmath0 , the scheme consider that such loops are produced by fermions , while for vector mesons , like the @xmath1 , bosons are the natural particles in the loop .    in general ,",
    "the cp conserving electromagnetic vertex can be decomposed into the following lorentz structure @xmath21    where the electromagnetic form factors can be identified as : @xmath22 is the electric charge form factor ( in @xmath23 units ) , @xmath24 is the magnetic dipole moment form factor ( in @xmath25 units ) and the electric quadrupole form factor is @xmath26 ( in @xmath27 units ) . the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are of common use in the literature to refer to the electromagnetic multipoles @xcite .",
    "the static electromagnetic properties of a particle are defined for the case when the particle is on - shell and in the limit of @xmath30 . at tree level ,",
    "for example , the standard model predicts for the @xmath0 to have @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , corresponding to @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "deviations from these values are generically called anomalous and are produced by the inclusion of higher order contributions @xcite . in the present case such contributions are exclusively those required to maintain the electromagnetic gauge invariance , upon the introduction of the finite decay width .",
    "let us identify the modification to the @xmath0 boson form factors introduced by the correction to the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "for that purpouse we consider the explicit expression of the vertex obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the mass of the emitting particles in the loop ( @xmath39 ) and its weak partner ( @xmath40 ) have been considered .",
    "the lorentz structure , transversality and on - shell condition of the boson along with the proper limit for @xmath41 leads to the following expressions for the form factors , defined in equation ( [ vercompletomul ] ) :    * electric charge    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the electric charge of the radiating particle in the loop , @xmath46 is the partial decay width for the modes corresponding to the particles in the loop , @xmath47 denotes the coupling and @xmath48 . a sum over all the allowed flavors and color degeneracies",
    "is explicitly included .",
    "since the schemes consider the particles in the loop to be on - shell , the flavors include all the leptons and the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 quarks .",
    "* magnetic dipole moment    @xmath53    * electric quadrupole moment    @xmath54    * * isospin limit * let us show , just for illustration , the above expressions in the case of @xmath55 .",
    "they become @xmath56 + @xmath57 + @xmath58    where @xmath59 .      proceeding along the same lines of the @xmath0 gauge boson",
    ", we obtain the modifications to the @xmath1 meson form factors , taking the complete expressions for the modified vertex computed in @xcite :    * electric charge    @xmath60    where , @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the effective @xmath63 coupling constant , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    *",
    "magnetic dipole moment    @xmath66    * electric quadrupole moment    @xmath67    * * isospin limit * the neutral and charged pions are almost degenerated . taking the isospin limit",
    "the form factors become @xmath68 + @xmath69 + @xmath70    where @xmath71 .",
    "the corrections for the @xmath72 meson follows from the results for the @xmath1 meson by including the two possible channels for the loop contributions : @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the corresponding masses and partial decay widths .",
    "the chiral limit correction to the vertex is known to be proportional to the tree level , in both the fermion and boson loops corrections @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this limit we can write the modification to the form factors in a generic form as follows : @xmath75",
    "the correction to the vertex seems to induce a modification to the the electric charge .",
    "however , since the ward identity is fulfilled , the modification to the vertex is followed by a modification to the propagator , which produces an exact cancelation of the correction to the electric charge .",
    "let us illustrate this point in more detail , for the sake of clarity we consider the expression in the chiral limit : the modified propagator can be set as @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , ( @xmath78 ) , i.e. , it can be seen as a renormalization of the vector field by the inclusion of the finite width @xmath79 where @xmath80 . then , the electromagnetic current becomes @xmath81 therefore , gauge invariance requires that @xmath82 , which is indeed the case , and the electric charge does not receive any correction .",
    "note that the modification to the vertex given by equation [ chiral ] implies that none of the multipoles receive corrections in the chiral limit .",
    "an analysis for unstable spin-1/2 particles has also been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , pointing out to complex renormalization factors as a requirement for properly defined physical quantities .",
    "further considerations on the renormalizability of the wave function can be seen in ref .",
    "+ the proper values of the modifications to the form factors are then found by the expressions given in the previous section divided by @xmath83 . in table",
    "[ multi ] , we present the corresponding results for the @xmath0 gauge boson and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons . recall that the particles in the loops are restricted to be on - shell . for the @xmath0 we have included all the leptons and the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 quarks , and the numerical values are similar to those obtained in the chiral limit (",
    "the largest @xmath84 mass ratio is only @xmath85 ) . as a reference of the magnitude of the modification",
    ", we recall several results obtained for contributions of different nature : ref .",
    "@xcite finds a correction to the mdm induced by the higgs of @xmath86 , reference @xcite finds a correction from quarks , leptons and higgs loops in the sm of @xmath87 , i.e. the width induced corrections is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than other standard contributions .",
    "note that , due to the renormalization condition , the argument that the finite width correction to the vertex is of order @xmath88 ( @xmath890.03 , 0.19 and 0.06 for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively ) does not extend to the electromagnetic multipoles .    for the @xmath1 meson ,",
    "pions are the only on - shell particles allowed in the loops . in this case",
    "the @xmath90 mass ratio ( @xmath91 ) is not as small as the corresponding for the @xmath84 , and therefore a significant effect from the mass of the particles in the loop is expected .",
    "we can compare our results as shown in table [ multi ] with those shown in table [ tabref ] as obtained from several approaches to qcd : light - front framework with constituent quarks @xcite and covariant formulations based on the dyson - schwinger equations of qcd @xcite . in general these last are about the same or one order of magnitude larger than the finite width induced corrections computed in this work .",
    "recently , lattice calculations of the form factors have become available @xcite and , in particular , the dependence on the pion mass they are able to reproduce has been exhibited . in figure",
    "[ dipoloplot ] , we compare our result for the mdm with lattice calculations as a function of the pion mass @xcite , we also include predictions from the models at the physical mass of the pion .",
    "we observe that the pion mass dependence of our results are mostly flat with a slightly tendency to rise for very large masses .",
    "lattice results are also flat with a tendency to increase for low masses .    the corrections for the @xmath72 meson is dominated by the @xmath92 mass ratio ( @xmath93 ) which is very large thus , although the width to mass ratio of the @xmath2 is only @xmath94 , the correction to the multipoles are important . compared with the predictions listed in table [ tabref ] , they can be about the same or one order of magnitude smaller .    .@xmath0 gauge boson , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons multipoles including the correction due to its finite width .
