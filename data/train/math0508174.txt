    "an integer solution @xmath7 to @xmath8 is called _ primitive _ if @xmath9 . the main goal of this paper is to prove :    [ goal ] the primitive integer solutions to @xmath0 are the @xmath10 triples @xmath11      we temporarily return to the discussion of @xmath12 for a fixed general triple @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 .",
    "there is a nave heuristic that for each triple of integers @xmath7 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the probability that @xmath12 is @xmath18 : this leads to the guesses that the set of primitive integer solutions is finite when @xmath19 and infinite when @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , these statements are theorems , proved by darmon and granville  @xcite and beukers  @xcite , respectively . where @xmath21 are nonzero integer constants .",
    "]    the method of _ descent _ , in one form or another , is the key ingredient used in the proofs of these theorems .",
    "descent relates the primitive integer solutions to the rational points ( possibly over some number field ) on one or more auxiliary curves , whose euler characteristic @xmath22 is a positive integer multiple of @xmath23 .",
    "this connection is made clear in  @xcite , for example . in section  [ s :",
    "descent theory ] , we will explain it in detail in the context of the special case @xmath24 .",
    "suppose @xmath20 . then @xmath25 , so @xmath26 .",
    "thus the auxiliary curves that have rational points are isomorphic to @xmath27 .",
    "the conclusion is that the primitive integer solutions fall into a finite number of parametrized families .",
    "these parametrizations have been found explicitly for every @xmath13 with @xmath20 , as we now indicate .",
    "the case where some exponent is @xmath28 is trivial , and the case where the multiset @xmath29 equals @xmath30 for some @xmath31 is elementary .",
    "the only remaining possibilities are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; these were completed by mordell , zagier , and edwards , respectively . see  @xcite for details .    if @xmath35 , then @xmath36 , so @xmath37 .",
    "there are only the cases @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the auxiliary curves turn out to be elliptic curves @xmath41 over @xmath42 , and descent proves that @xmath43 is finite in each case .",
    "( the finiteness should not be surprising , since these elliptic curves have very low conductor . )",
    "one then easily finds that the only nontrivial primitive solution , up to permutations and sign changes , is @xmath44 .",
    "many , if not all , of these cases are classical : fermat invented the method of descent to do @xmath45 , and euler did @xmath46 .    if @xmath19 , then @xmath47 .",
    "each auxiliary curve has finitely many rational points , by  @xcite , and hence we get the darmon - granville result that for each @xmath13 there are at most finitely many nontrivial primitive solutions . for many @xmath13 these solutions",
    "have been determined explicitly .",
    "these are summarized in table  [ table : pqr ] .    .",
    "we list exponent triples @xmath13 such that @xmath19 and the primitive integer solutions to @xmath8 have been determined .",
    "the notation @xmath29 means that the solutions have been determined for every permutation of @xmath13 : this makes a difference only if at least two of @xmath48 are even .",
    "solutions are listed only up to sign changes and permutations .",
    "solutions of the form @xmath49 are omitted .",
    "heuristics suggest that probably there are no more solutions for @xmath13 with @xmath19 : in fact a cash prize awaits anyone who finds a new solution  @xcite .",

    "then the component group @xmath55 of @xmath56 is obtained as follows .",
