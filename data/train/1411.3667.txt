    "diffusion - limited aggregation ( in short , dla ) is a statistical mechanics growth model that has been introduced in 1981 by sander and witten @xcite .",
    "it is defined as follows . a first particle  a site of @xmath0",
    " is fixed .",
    "then , a particle is released `` at infinity '' and performs a symmetric random walk .",
    "as soon as it touches the first particle , it stops and sticks to it .",
    "then , we release another particle , which will also stick to the cluster ( the set of the particles of the aggregate ) , and so on   after a large number of iterations , one obtains a fractal - looking cluster .",
    "dla does not just model sticking particles , but also hele - shaw flow @xcite , dendritic growth @xcite and dielectric breakdown @xcite .",
    "figure  [ todd ] illustrates the viscous fingering phenomenon , which appears in hele - shaw flow .",
    "this phenomenon can be observed by injecting quickly a large quantity of oil into water .",
    "this model is extremely hard to study ; only two non - trivial results are rigorously known about dla : an upper bound on the speed of growth @xcite and the fact that the infinite cluster has almost surely infinitely many holes , i.e.  that the complement of the cluster has infinitely many finite components @xcite .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that the dynamics is neither monotone nor local , and that it roughens the cluster .",
    "the _ non - locality _ is quite clear : if big arms surround @xmath1 , even if they are far from it , @xmath1 will never be added to the cluster .    by _ non - monotonicity _ ( which is a more serious issue ) , we mean that there is no coupling between a dla starting from a cluster @xmath2 and another from a cluster @xmath3 such that , at each step , the inclusion of the clusters remains valid almost surely . to understand why ,",
    "throw the same particles for both dynamics , i.e.  use the nave coupling .",
    "the big cluster will catch the particles sooner than the small one : when a particle is stopped in the @xmath2-dynamics - cluster is still bigger than the @xmath4-one  ] , it may go on moving for the @xmath4-dynamics and stick somewhere that is not in the @xmath2-cluster , which would break the monotonicity .",
    "in fact , this is even a proof of the non - existence of _ any _ monotonic coupling , under the assumption that there exists @xmath5 such that if @xmath6 , @xmath7 can be connected to infinity by a @xmath0-path avoiding @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the fact that the dynamics _ roughens _ the cluster instead of smoothing it is what makes the difference between the usual ( external ) dla and the internal dla of @xcite , for which a shape theorem exists @xcite . even though this roughening is not mathematically established , simulations such as the one of figure  [ dla ] suggest it by the fractal nature of the picture they provide .    the rigorous study of dla seeming , for the moment , out of reach , several toy models have been studied .",
    "these models are usually easier to study for one of the following reasons :    * either the particles are not added according to the harmonic measure of the cluster ( i.e.  launched at infinity ) but `` according to some nicer measure '' ; * or the dynamics does not occur in the plane or @xcite for results on long - range dla on @xmath9 . ] .    in this paper , we prove some results on directed diffusion - limited aggregation ( ddla ) , which is a variant where the particles follow downward directed random walks .",
    "a large cluster is presented in figure  [ ddla ] .",
    "directed versions of dla have already been considered by physicists but , to our knowledge , they have been rigorously studied only in the case of the binary tree ( or bethe lattice ) .",
    "the present model is defined in the plane .",
    "simulations strongly suggest that the ddla - cluster converges after suitable rescaling to some deterministic convex compact , delimited from below by two segments .",
    "ddla can be seen either as a ballistic deposition model where the falling particles fluctuate randomly or as a stretch version of dla .",
    "see respectively @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a study of the hastings - levitov version of ddla ; @xcite and the present paper have been written independently .",
    "section  [ defddla ] is devoted to several equivalent definitions of dla . in section  [ infvol ]",
    ", we define the dynamics in infinite volume . in section  [ info ] ,",
    "we obtain a bound on the speed of propagation of the information for a ddla starting from a ( sufficiently ) horizontal interface . in section  [ kestin ] , we adapt kesten s argument ( see @xcite ) to obtain bounds on the speed of horizontal growth and vertical growth .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : last ] explores the geometry of the infinite cluster .",
    "we use `` a.s.e . '' as an abbreviation for `` almost surely , eventually '' , which means either `` almost surely , there exists @xmath10 such that for all @xmath11 '' or `` almost surely , there exists @xmath12 such that for all @xmath13 '' .",
    "i thank vincent beffara for proposing this topic of research to me , as well as for his advice and availability .",
    "i am indebted to vincent beffara and jessica todd for allowing me to use in this paper some of their pictures .",
    "in this paper , when dealing with ddla , we will think of @xmath14 as rotated by an angle of @xmath15 ( so that the particles we will throw move downward ) .",
    "the vertices of @xmath14 will often be referred to as sites .",
    "let @xmath16 be the set of the ( directed ) edges ; it endows @xmath14 with a structure of directed graph .",
    "we will denote by @xmath17 the graph - distance on @xmath18 , i.e.  the @xmath19-distance . if @xmath20 is an edge , we call @xmath1 the upper vertex of @xmath21 and @xmath22 its lower vertex . they are referred to as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a downward directed symmetric random walk is a markov chain with transition probabilities @xmath25 an upward directed symmetric random walk is obtained with transition probabilities @xmath26 when the starting point of a directed random walk is not specified , it is tacitly taken to be @xmath27 .",
    "the height of @xmath28 , denoted by @xmath29 , is @xmath30 .",
    "its horizontal deviation ( relative to @xmath31 ) is @xmath32 .",
    "the height ( resp .",

    "finally , if one fixes a subset @xmath2 of @xmath0 , the activity of a site @xmath43 relative to @xmath2 is @xmath44\\cdot|\\{e\\in\\textbf{e}~:~ \\textbf{l}(e)\\in c~\\&~ \\textbf{u}(e)=p\\}|,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is an upward directed symmetric random walk and @xmath46 stands for the cardinality operator . in what follows",
    ", we will consider a growing subset of @xmath0 , called cluster .",
    "the current activity ( or activity ) of a site @xmath1 will then be relative to the cluster at the considered time .",
    "the activity of the cluster will be the sum over all sites of their activity .      at time @xmath31",
    ", the cluster is @xmath47 .",
    "assume that the cluster has been built up to time @xmath37 , and that @xmath48 . to build @xmath49 , choose any line @xmath50 above @xmath51 .",
    "then , independently of all the choices made so far , choose uniformly a point in @xmath50 , and send a downward symmetric random walk @xmath52 from this point .",
    "if the walk intersects @xmath51 , then there must be a first time @xmath53 when the walker is on a point of the cluster : let @xmath54 if the random walk fails to hit the cluster , we iterate the procedure @xmath55choice of a starting point @xmath56 launching of a random walk@xmath57 independently and with the same @xmath58 , until a random walk hits the cluster , which will happen almost surely .",
    "this is obviously the same as conditioning the procedure to succeed .",
    "the dynamics does not depend on the choices of @xmath58 : indeed , choosing uniformly a point in @xmath59 and taking a step downward give the same measure to all the points of @xmath50 ( and if a walker goes outside @xmath60 , it will never hit the cluster ) .",
    "the dynamics is thus well - defined .",
    "we call this process directed diffusion - limited aggregation ( or ddla )",
    ".    since the process does not depend on the choices of @xmath58 , we can take it as large as we want so that we may ( informally at least ) think of the particles as falling from infinity .",
    "here is another process , which is the same ( in distribution ) as ddla .",
    "we set @xmath61 assume that we have built @xmath51 , a random set of cardinality @xmath62 .",
    "we condition the following procedure to succeed :    we choose , uniformly and independently of all the choices made so far , an edge @xmath21 such that @xmath63 .",
    "we launch an upward directed symmetric random walk from @xmath23 .",
    "we say that the procedure succeeds if the random walk does not touch @xmath51 .",
    "the particle added to the cluster is the upper vertex of the edge that has been chosen . iterating the process",
    ", we obtain a well - defined dynamics .",
    "it is the same as the first dynamics : this is easily proved by matching downward paths with the corresponding upward ones .",
    "we now define ddla in continuous time : this is the natural continuous time version of the second definition of ddla .",
    "let @xmath64 be a family of independent poisson processes of intensity 1 indexed by the set of the directed edges .",
    "the cluster @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66 and we set @xmath67 .",
    "assume that for some ( almost surely well - defined ) stopping time @xmath68 , the cluster @xmath69 contains exactly @xmath37 particles .",
    "then , wait for an edge whose lower vertex is in @xmath69 to ring ( such edges will be called growth - edges ) .",
    "when the clock on a growth - edge @xmath21 rings , send an independent upward directed random walk from its upper vertex .",
    "if it does not intersect @xmath69 , add a particle at @xmath23 and define @xmath70 to be the current time .",
    "otherwise , wait for another growth - edge to ring , and iterate the procedure .",
    "this dynamics is almost surely well - defined for all times is almost surely infinite ] because it is stochastically dominated by first - passage percolation @xcite .",
    "markov chain theory guarantees that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are identical in distribution .",
    "this definition in continuous time consists in adding sites at a rate equal to their current activity .      before going any further",
    ", it may be useful to know what is the theorem we are looking for and how the results presented in this paper may play a part in its proof . in this subsection",
    ", we present _ highly informal heuristics that have not been made mathematically rigorous in any way yet_. they constitute a strategy for proving a shape theorem for ddla .",
    "there is some convex compact @xmath4 of non - empty interior such that @xmath73 converges almost surely to @xmath4 for the hausdorff metric . besides , the boundary of @xmath4 consists in two segments and the @xmath74-rotated graph of a concave function .    to prove such a result ,",
    "the step 0 may be to prove that the width and height of the cluster both grow linearly in time , so that we would know that we use the right scaling .",
    "this would result from a stronger form of fact  [ kestt ] .",
    "provided this , one may use compactness arguments to prove that if there exists a unique `` invariant non - empty compact set '' @xmath4 , then we have the desired convergence ( to @xmath4 ) . by invariance ,",
    "we informally mean the following : if @xmath75 is large enough and if we launch a ddla at time @xmath75 from @xmath76 , then @xmath77 `` remains close '' to @xmath4 .",
    "this existence and uniqueness may be proved by finding a ( maybe non - explicit ) ordinary differential equation satisfied by the upper interface of @xmath4 .",
    "to do so , we would proceed in two steps .",
    "first of all , one needs to check that the upper interface is typically `` more or less '' the @xmath74-rotated graph of a differentiable function . to do so",
    ", one would need to control fjords .",
    "roughly speaking , we call fjord the area delimited by two long and close arms of the cluster .",
    "fjords are the enemies of both regularity and `` being the graph of a function '' .    here",
    "are some heuristics about fjords : in figure  [ ddla ] , we observe that there are mesoscopic fjords far from the vertical axis and no such fjord close to it .",
    "we try to account for this .",
    "we say that a site @xmath1 shades a second one if it can catch particles that would go to the second site if @xmath1 was vacant .",
    "assume that we have a behaviour as suggested by figure  [ ddla ] .",
    "if we are close to the vertical axis , the local slope is close to @xmath31 .",
    "we will assume that , at any time , none of the two top - points of the arms delineating the considered fjord shades the other : they will thus survive ( i.e.  keep moving ) , following more or less upward directed random walks . by recurrence of the 2-dimensional random walk , we obtain that the two top - points will collide at some time , closing the fjord . to avoid the shading phenomenon , one needs a still unknown proper and _ tractable _ definition of top - point .",
    "however , it seems quite reasonable to expect this phenomenon `` not to occur '' if the slope is close to @xmath31 because there is no initial shading .    when the slope gets higher , the shading phenomenon appears .",
    "if the slope is not too high , the `` lower top - point '' manages to survive but it is hard for it to catch up with the upper one : this creates a fjord .",
    "if the slope is too high , the `` lower top - point '' stops catching particles : we are in the lower interface .",
    "now , we need to find an ode satisfied by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the angular parametrization of the upper interface of @xmath4 and is defined on @xmath80 .",
    "we assume that @xmath81 corresponds to what we think of as the vertical .",
    "assume that one can launch a ddla from an infinite line of slope @xmath82 ( which is made possible by section  [ infvol ] ) and define a deterministic speed of vertical growth @xmath83 .",
    "the set @xmath4 being invariant , @xmath84 must be proportional to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 stands for the local slope of @xmath4 at the neighborhood of the point defined by @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    more exactly",
    ", we have @xmath89 the knowledge of @xmath90 due to the previous step allows us to find @xmath91 .",
    "simulations suggest that @xmath92 ; corollary  [ coro : truc ] is a weak result in this direction .",
    "the last point that has to be checked is that the lower interface consists of two segments .",
    "assume that the points of the lower interface are of bounded local slope . from this and large deviation theory , one can deduce that it costs typically exponentially much for a particle to stick to the lower interface at large distance from the upper interface .",
    "from the upper interface is lower than @xmath93 , for some constant @xmath94 . ]",
    "this might allow us to compare ddla with ballistic deposition , for which the upper interface converges to the graph of a concave function @xcite and the lower interface converges to the union of two segments ( use the kesten - hammersley lemma @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we define directed diffusion - limited aggregation starting from a suitable infinite set . notice that we make the trivial adjustment that the process now lives in @xmath0 instead of @xmath95 .",
    "here is a very informal description of the construction .",
    "each edge has a poisson clock and infinitely many upward directed symmetric random walks attached to it , everything being chosen independently .",
    "when a clock rings at some edge for the @xmath96 time , if its upper extremity is vacant and its lower one occupied , the @xmath96 random walk is sent and we see if it hits the current cluster or not : we add a particle if and only if the walk does not hit the cluster .    in finite volume",
    ", this is not problematic because we can ( almost surely ) define the first ( or next ) ringing time : since we only need to know the state of the cluster just before we send the walk , the construction is done . in the case of an infinite initial cluster , in any non - trivial time interval , there are almost surely infinitely many ringing times to consider . to define the dynamics ,",
    "a solution is to show that , for all @xmath97 , what happens at @xmath98 before time @xmath99 just depends on some random finite set of edges . indeed , in this case",
    ", we can apply the construction in finite volume .",
    "this is the idea behind harris - like constructions .",
