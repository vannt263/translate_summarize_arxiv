    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) incorporates electroweak gauge symmetry breaking via the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "the resulting higgs boson of the theory has yet to be observed experimentally .",
    "the higgs mass is not predicted by the theory but can be constrained due to its predicted couplings to other particles .",
    "global fits to precision electroweak data have been updated to incorporate the new world average of the @xmath4 boson mass , @xmath5 gev/@xmath3 , and the top quark mass , @xmath6 gev/@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the fit favors a light higgs boson with mass @xmath7  gev/@xmath3 , which translates into an upper limit of 154 gev/@xmath3 at 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "results from direct searches at the lep experiments exclude higgs mass values lower than 114.4 gev/@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this motivates searches for a higgs boson just above the limits set by lep .",
    "both tevatron experiments , cdf and d0 , recognize the search for the sm higgs boson as one of their highest priorities .    for high higgs boson masses , with @xmath8  140 gev/@xmath3 , the decay @xmath9 dominates . for low higgs boson masses with @xmath2  140 gev/@xmath3 , the decay @xmath10 dominates , with a branching ratio ( br ) of 73 % at @xmath11  gev/@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "even though higgs production through gluon fusion @xmath12 has the largest cross section times br  @xcite , the data sample with bottom quark jets is dominated by non - resonant qcd multi - jet background . as a result , searches for production of a higgs boson in association with a @xmath4 or a @xmath13 boson yield the most sensitive results because the background rate is reduced by demanding the presence of a reconstructed @xmath4 or @xmath13 boson .",
    "efficient @xmath14 quark identification with high purity is a key element when searching for @xmath10 signatures .",
    "jets originating from @xmath14 quarks can be `` tagged '' by reconstructing the @xmath14 decay vertex , displaced from the primary interaction vertex due to the relatively long @xmath14 lifetime .",
    "cdf employs secondary vertex and jet lifetime tagging algorithms to select @xmath14 jets .",
    "the purity is improved in a second step using a neural network jet - flavor separator .",
    "d0 uses a neural network @xmath14 tagging algorithm based on secondary vertex and jet lifetime tagging information to select candidate jets at specific operating points of the neural network output . using this tool ,",
    "@xmath14 tagging efficiencies have been improved by 33% while keeping the rate of falsely identified light flavor jets ( mistags ) low .",
    "the efficiencies range between 40 - 70% for @xmath14 jets at a low mistag rates between 0.5 - 3% for light flavor jets .",
    "almost all higgs searches at the tevatron employ advanced analysis techniques like artificial neural networks ( nn ) , boosted decision trees ( bdt ) or matrix element techniques ( me ) to combine kinematic characteristics of signal and background events into a single discriminant .",
    "these techniques improve the separation of signal to background over the invariant higgs boson mass distribution which is the most important single variable .",
    "careful validation of all input variables is mandatory for robust results .",
    "the experimental signature in this search channel is an energetic lepton ( @xmath16 ) , large missing transverse energy ( ) from the neutrino and two energetic jets of which one or two are @xmath14 tagged .",
    "the dominant background arise from @xmath17 and top production .",
    "several improvements have advanced the sensitivity in this channel .",
    "increased acceptance is obtained by extending the muon coverage , use of track - only leptons , looser @xmath14 tagging and jet flavor purification .",
    "about 3 - 4 higgs candidate events are expected per fb@xmath0 for @xmath18 115 gev/@xmath3 .",

    "is obtained in that channel .",
    "the @xmath24 channel features a pair of energetic leptons and a pair        of energetic @xmath14 jets which allows to select a sample with very little non-@xmath13 background .",
    "one higgs event is expected per fb@xmath0 for @xmath18 115 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "highlights in this analysis have been the development of looser lepton identification to increase the acceptance by making use of complementary @xmath13 boson triggers .",
    "the di - jet system is corrected with a neural network which assigns  to the jets according to their  projections and event topology .",
    "the cdf analysis uses a two dimensional neural network discriminant based on nine kinematic variables in order to maximize discrimination of the signal from @xmath13+jets and top background .",
    "another cdf analysis uses a matrix element technique to search for a @xmath25 signal .",
    "the d0 analysis uses ten kinematic variables combined into a nn to separate signal from background in the di - electron channel and a bdt technique in the di - muon channel .",
    "figure [ zhplots ] shows discriminant distributions from cdf and d0 .",
    "the observed ( expected ) limits are : cdf 2d nn : 11.6 ( 11.8 ) @xmath22 sm , d0 nn / bdt : 11.0 ( 12.3 ) @xmath22 sm for @xmath18 115 gev/@xmath3 and cdf me : 14.2 ( 15.0 ) @xmath22 sm at @xmath18 120 gev/@xmath3 .",

    "events from @xmath15 are also accepted when the electron or muon escapes detection .",
    "next to two jet events , also three jet events are accepted and capture cases where a tau or a hard gluon radiation is reconstructed as an additional jet .",
    "highlights in this analysis have been the implementation of looser jet selection , extended @xmath14 tagging and improved di - jet mass resolution due to track - based jet energy corrections .",
    "about 3 - 4 higgs candidate events are expected per fb@xmath0 for @xmath18 115 gev/@xmath3 . both , cdf and d0 employ a  + 2 jets trigger to select candidate events .",
    "the dominant background arises from qcd multi - jet production where mismeasured jets lead to fake .",

    "both experiments have made progress in exploring the prospects of higgs search channels which , by themselves , are not discovery channels but add sensitivity in combination . in the sm ,",
    "the @xmath28 br is        only 0.22% for a higgs boson mass of 130 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "however , in some fermiophobic models beyond the sm this br can be significantly enhanced .",
