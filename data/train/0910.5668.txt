    "chromium condensates were first experimentally realized in 2005 @xcite . in contrast to condensates of alkali atoms ,",
    "@xmath0cr condensates present an additional , non - negligible interaction , the dipolar interaction .",
    "it is non - local , anisotropic and long - range and these features introduce novel aspects in the physics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "the atom - atom interaction is then determined by the balance of the @xmath1-wave contact interaction and the dipolar interaction , allowing thus to investigate the effects of their interplay . although alkali atoms also possess some magnetic dipole moment , it is thirty - six times weaker than in chromium , which makes the latter a suitable system to experimentally study dipolar condensates of atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the evidence of the superfluid character of becs comes mainly from the appearance of singly - quantized vortices above a critical rotation frequency as a means to convey angular momentum to the system .",
    "vortices have not been experimentally realized in dipolar becs yet , but they are a most appealing phenomenon and there is intensive theoretical research on them @xcite .    the critical frequency for vortex nucleation in dipolar condensates has been predicted theoretically in different papers @xcite .",
    "this critical frequency is based on a thermodynamical consideration that takes into account the energy of the vortex at the center of the trap @xcite . however , in the present understanding of vortex formation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , the nucleation process takes place at the surface of the condensate and then the vortex enters it .",
    "therefore , the theoretical prediction provides a lower bound to the experimental critical frequency @xcite .",
    "this difference can be understood in terms of an energy barrier the system needs to overcome to bring the vortex from the surface to the center of the condensate @xcite .",
    "that is , the nucleation of a vortex is associated with the existence of an energy barrier in the configuration space between the initial vortex - free state and the final centered vortex state .",
    "the formation energy of a vortex can be estimated by calculating the energy of a single off - center vortex as a function of the vortex core position .",
    "the aim of this work is to quantify this extra energy that should be given to dipolar condensates to nucleate a vortex .",
    "since we are interested mainly on the effects of the dipolar interaction , we will consider a very small @xmath1-wave scattering length . in the numerical calculation , we solve the three - dimensional ( 3d ) gross - pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame using the imaginary - time evolution method .",
    "we obtain the vortex states , the vortex formation energy and hence the nucleation barrier .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we describe the theoretical framework and the system under study . in sec .",
    "[ tf ] the analytic expressions for the energy barrier in the thomas - fermi regime are given in 2d and 3d . in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] we present the numerical calculation of the nucleation barrier and compare it both to the thomas - fermi results for purely @xmath1-wave condensates and to a pseudo - analytical model which is shown to reproduce very well the numerical results .",
    "finally , a summary and concluding remarks are offered in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "weakly interacting dipolar condensates are well described in the mean - field regime by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which includes a new term taking into account the dipole - dipole interaction . in this framework",
    "it is possible to numerically study vortex states by working in the rotating frame @xcite , that is a reference frame that rotates at a frequency @xmath2 around the @xmath3 axis .",
    "the gp equation then reads @xmath4 \\psi(\\mathbf{r } ) \\nonumber \\\\ % & & + \\left .",
    "\\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu^2}{4 \\pi } \\int d\\mathbf{r ' } \\ , % \\frac{1 - 3 \\cos^2 \\theta}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|^3 } \\,|\\psi(\\mathbf{r'})|^2 & &    \\qquad\\qquad= \\tilde{\\mu } \\ ,",

    "the terms in the left - hand side of the equation are , respectively , the kinetic energy , the trapping potential , the @xmath1-wave contact interaction , the dipolar potential and the rotating potential .",
    "when the dipolar bec is at rest , the vortex - free state is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) by setting @xmath9 .",
    "the trapping potential is assumed to be harmonic and with axial symmetry , being @xmath3 the symmetry axis @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the radial and axial angular trap frequencies , respectively .",
    "the contact interaction potential is characterized by the coupling constant @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the @xmath1-wave scattering length . using the physics of feshbach resonances ,",
    "the value of @xmath15 can be tuned to very small values by changing the magnitude of an external magnetic field @xcite . if this tuning is performed far enough from the actual resonance , the condensate is not destroyed and experiments can be indeed carried out @xcite .    the mean - field dipolar interaction @xmath16 is given by the integral @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dipole - dipole potential . in this equation @xmath19 is the magnetic dipole moment of the atoms , @xmath20 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath21 is the distance between the dipoles , and @xmath22 is the angle between the vector @xmath21 and the dipole axis , which we also take to be @xmath3 .",
    "note that dipolar interactions are anisotropic , being attractive when the dipoles are head - to - tail and repulsive when they are side - by - side .",
    "therefore , in our symmetry configuration , the dipolar interaction will be attractive along @xmath3 and repulsive in @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions .",
    "since we are dealing with pancake - like condensates , the overall interaction will be mainly repulsive , although the small attractive part is what can bring instability and collapse to the condensate @xcite .",
    "when the rotation frequency @xmath2 exceeds a critical frequency @xmath25 , the centered - vortex state becomes energetically favorable and eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) converges to such a solution , irrespective of the initial conditions . however , an off - axis vortex is not a stable state of the system and therefore can not be found as a solution of gp equation as it appears in ( [ gp ] ) .",
    "one thus needs to impose some constraint during the minimization process to fix the vorticity along a line @xmath26 . in this work",
    "this is achieved as follows .",
    "first , we generalize the feynmann - onsager ansatz for a centered - vortex state to the case of an off - axis vortex @xcite , @xmath27 and use it as the initial wave function . here",
    "@xmath28 is the ground state vortex - free wave function obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) with @xmath9 .",
    "this expression fixes a unit of vorticity along the line @xmath29 and corresponds to a straight vortex line .",
    "to maintain such a vorticity during the imaginary - time minimization we impose the conditions @xcite @xmath30&= 0\\quad\\forall y , z \\\\",

    "these relations are the equivalent of considering the vortex line as the intersection of two flat nodal surfaces , instead of allowing them to have some curvature . with this method",
    ", the quantization of the circulation is ensured in all cases , but the solutions are restricted to the case of straight vortex lines .    in order to compute the energy of the condensate",
    "we evaluate the energy density functional in the rotating frame , which has the standard gp form but with a new term , @xmath31 , which is the interaction energy due to the dipole - dipole potential , @xmath32   & & = e_{\\text{kin } } + e_{\\text{trap } } + e_{\\text{int } } + e_{\\text{dip } } + e_l= \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.8cm}= \\int\\frac { \\hbar^2 } { 2 m }   |\\nabla \\psi |^2 d { \\bf r } + \\int v_{\\text{trap}}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\,|\\psi|^2 d { \\bf r } + \\int\\frac{g}{2 } \\ , |\\psi|^4 d { \\bf r } +    \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.8 cm } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int v_{\\text{dip}}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\ ,    \\label{ed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this work we will consider a @xmath0cr bec of @xmath33 atoms in a trap with frequencies @xmath34 s@xmath35 and @xmath36 s@xmath35 , with a magnetic dipole moment of @xmath37 and a scattering length @xmath38 .",
    "the oscillator length in the plane , @xmath39 , gives an order of magnitude of the size of the condensate , and in our case takes the value @xmath40 . by evolving the gp equation ( [ gp ] ) in imaginary - time until convergence is reached ,",
    "we find its solution .",
    "this is equivalent to a minimization of the energy density functional ( [ ed ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] we show the density profiles of the ground state and the singly - quantized vortex state of such a condensate in the three situations : when only @xmath1-wave interactions are considered , when @xmath1-wave plus dipolar interactions are considered , and when only dipolar interactions are considered .",
    "we see there that the dipolar interactions make the condensate more repulsive , hence increasing its size in @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions . for more detailed discussions of condensate deformation due to",
    "anisotropic dipolar interactions see refs.@xcite and references therein .",
    "in purely @xmath1-wave condensates , when the number of particles is large and the repulsive contact interaction is strong , surface effects at the boundary of the condensate become negligible . under these conditions",
    "one can neglect the kinetic energy term in eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) and show that the density has a parabolic profile .",
    "this allows to find analytical solutions for the bec .",
    "this approximation is known as thomas - fermi approximation ( tf ) and can be applied whenever the condition @xmath41 is verified @xcite .    for dipolar gases there",
    "also exists a tf approximation @xcite , and it is possible to obtain semi - analytical expressions , which come in terms of a complicated transcendental relation . in this case",
    "the condition @xmath41 does not define the tf regime , since it does not take the dipolar interaction into account .",
    "however , a qualitative characterization of the tf limit in dipolar condensates relies on the parabolic density profile of the ground state @xcite .    for the sake of clarity",
    ", we will specify when we are considering tf results only applicable to @xmath1-wave condensates ( swtf ) , or when we are using a more general approach which only relies on the parabolic profile of the condensate and whose results can be applied both to @xmath1-wave and dipolar cases ( tf ) .",
    "the energy barrier @xmath42 that has to be overcome to nucleate a vortex is given by the vortex energy in the rotating frame as a function of the vortex distance @xmath43 from the symmetry axis .",
    "it can be calculated from the energy in the laboratory frame @xmath44 using @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the expectation value of the angular momentum operator @xmath7 . to simplify the notation , we consider @xmath42 and @xmath44 to be the energies referred to the ground state of the system .",
    "note that the energy barrier depends on the actual value of @xmath2 but the energy in the laboratory frame does not . for @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "we have @xmath49 since under this conditions the energy of a centered vortex is exactly the rotation energy , which comes directly from the definition of critical frequency @xcite . for a vortex near the boundary of the condensate @xmath50 @xcite , whence @xmath51 . between these two limits ,",
    "the energy barrier reaches a maximum value @xmath52 at the position @xmath53 , corresponding to the extra energy the system needs in order to carry the vortex from the surface to the center of the condensate .    in the tf limit it is possible to obtain analytic expressions for the energy barrier for vortex nucleation .",
    "although we are dealing with 3d systems , since the trap anisotropy parameter is large , @xmath54 , it is worth considering the 2d limit .",
    "we will derive an analytical expression for 2d systems and briefly discuss the results for 3d condensates @xcite .      in the tf limit",
    "the vortex core can be considered to be much smaller than the radius of the condensate , i.e. @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the healing length .",
    "then , a good approximation is to consider the energy of the vortex to be proportional to the energy of the centered - vortex configuration @xcite@xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are , respectively , the ground state densities at positions @xmath60 and @xmath48 .",
    "then the energy barrier takes the form @xmath61 to obtain an expression of the barrier , one substitutes @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eqbar ] ) by their tf expressions @xcite , which assume a parabolic profile of the density of the vortex - free state . this procedure yields @xmath63- \\omega\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{d}{r_{tf}}\\right)^2\\right]^2\\ .",

    "( [ eqbartf2d ] ) , one can find the position of the barrier height @xmath64 and its value @xmath65 where the tf radius in the radial direction @xmath66 is related to its root - mean - square ( @xmath67 ) analogue @xmath68 by @xmath69 . in the swtf limit",
    ", one can find an analytical expression for the critical frequency @xcite @xmath70 which takes the value @xmath71 for our parameters . to obtain eq .",
    "( [ omega2d ] ) an explicit expression for @xmath56 is used which can only be applied to @xmath1-wave condensates .      in 3d",
    ", the procedure to obtain an expression for the energy barrier differs from the 2d case .",
    "it has been reported elsewhere @xcite , and here we only summarize the main results .",
    "the nucleation energy barrier has the expression @xmath72^{3/2 } - \\omega\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{d}{r_{tf}}\\right)^2\\right]^{5/2}\\label{eqbartf3d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the maximum at the position @xmath73 and a barrier height @xmath74 as in the 2d case , the relation @xmath69 also holds .",
    "note that expression ( [ eqbartf3d ] ) has been found only using that the density profile is parabolic , and makes no specific assumption of purely @xmath1-wave interacting becs .",
    "therefore , it also applies when dipolar interactions are considered , provided the density profile is parabolic , as in 2d , eq .",
    "( [ eqbartf2d ] ) .",
    "again , in the swtf limit one can find an analytic expression for the critical frequency @xcite @xmath75 which takes the value @xmath76 in the present work .",
    "in this section we use the numerical procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ theory ] to solve the gp equation for different vortex distances @xmath60 from the symmetry axis .",
    "an estimate of the formation energy of the vortex is then obtained from the energy in the rotating frame given by the energy functional eq .",
    "( [ ed ] ) relative to the ground state energy .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ barrier - critica ] the vortex formation energy as a function of the vortex displacement from the center , for the same cases as shown in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] and for @xmath47 .",
    "the critical rotation frequency is calculated from thermodynamical arguments @xcite , giving @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the energies of the centered vortex state and the ground state in the laboratory frame , respectively .",
    "we see in the figure that the centered - vortex state and the vortex - free state have the same energy in the rotating frame but they are indeed separated by an energy barrier .",
    "the critical frequencies are different in each case , namely : @xmath80 for a purely @xmath1-wave condensate , and @xmath81 for a condensate with both interactions and for a purely dipolar condensate .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ barrier - critica ] corresponds to the purely contact interaction bec , the dash - dotted line to a condensate with contact plus dipolar interactions , and the solid line corresponds to a purely dipolar bec .",
    "the effect of the strength of the overall interaction is to decrease the barrier height : it is higher for an @xmath1-wave condensate because it is the weakest interacting case ( see fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ) and smaller for a condensate with dipolar plus @xmath1-wave interactions , since here the effective repulsion is the strongest . besides , when dipolar interactions are considered the radial extent of the condensate is larger and thus the barrier height is displaced towards the surface , as compared to the purely @xmath1-wave case .",
    "to get rid of the effect of the different sizes due to the different strengths of the repulsive interactions , we plot the energy barriers in fig .  [ barrier - critica_norm ] as a function of the vortex displacement normalized to the transversal @xmath67-radius of the corresponding ground state , @xmath82 .",
    "it is interesting to note that even though @xmath83 is different for each curve , the three critical barriers have the same qualitative behavior when expressed in units of @xmath68 .    in fig .",
    "[ barrier - critica_norm ] we compare the numerical barriers to those obtained from the swtf results , which correspond to eqs .",
    "( [ eqbartf2d ] ) and ( [ eqbartf3d ] ) using the critical frequencies eqs .",
    "( [ omega2d ] ) and ( [ omega3d ] ) , respectively .",
    "the disagreement between the swtf prediction and the numerical calculations can be understood recalling that the parameters used in the present work lead to @xmath84 , which is not much larger than 1 and therefore we are not in the full range of validity of the swtf approximation . nonetheless , to obtain an order of magnitude for the energy barriers , it is possible to combine the tf results ( [ eqbartf2d ] ) and ( [ eqbartf3d ] ) with the numerical values of @xmath25 and @xmath68 obtained from the gp equation .",
    "this pseudo - analytical method avoids thus the calculation of the complete energy barrier .",
    "table  [ table ] shows the main parameters of the barriers using these approximations at the critical frequency .",
    ".comparison of the energy barrier maximum and its position obtained in the numerical simulation ( sim . ) and the 2d and 3d pseudo - analytical results . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see from table  [ table ] that the 3d approximation is in good agreement with the characteristics of the barriers found in the numerical simulation , whereas the 2d approximation shows some deviation .",
    "this means that in spite of the large anisotropy of the trapping potential , the 3d nature of the condensate is important to characterize the vortex energetics .",
    "in addition , the energy of the maximum is better reproduced for condensates with dipolar or both interactions .",
    "this happens because the corresponding density profiles ( see fig .  [ profiles ] ) are closer to the tf inverted parabola profile than those of the purely @xmath1-wave condensate .",
    "in this work we have studied the energy barriers for vortex nucleation in the case of dipolar condensates .",
    "we have considered the regime of small scattering lengths , which in our case means that dipolar effects are enhanced , and have obtained the vortex formation energies as a function of the vortex displacement from the symmetry axis .",
    "we have compared the results obtained when @xmath1-wave plus dipolar interactions are considered with those obtained in the cases of condensates interacting only via @xmath1-wave interactions and condensates with only dipolar interactions .",
    "completely analytic expressions can be found in the @xmath1-wave thomas - fermi regime for the energy barriers in 2d and 3d . from these expressions",
    "the position of the barrier maximum and its value can be obtained .",
    "since they mainly hold for @xmath41 , their predictions are not in much agreement with our numerical results .",
    "however , a pseudo - analytical approach can be used which is based on the equations from tf theory , but taking the critical frequency and radius of the condensate from the numerical results .",
    "this procedure only assumes parabolic density profiles for the ground state densities , thus being applicable to both @xmath1-wave and dipolar condensates , provided they satisfy the above condition .    for condensates with dipolar interaction ,",
    "this pseudo - analytical method has been shown to provide close quantitative results for the nucleation energy barrier when the 3d thomas - fermi expression is used .",
    "since the density profiles for the dipolar and @xmath1-wave plus dipolar condensates are approximately parabolic , the thomas - fermi expression for the energy barrier holds and its predictions are in accordance with the numerical results .",
    "this method can be a useful tool to estimate the energy barrier for vortex nucleation , avoiding thus the calculation of the complete energy barrier .",
