    "the use of effective hadronic models based on chiral symmetry has been quite successful in describing nuclear matter , finite nuclei and neutron stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while most of the approaches are based on variations of the linear sigma model or its non - linear realization , work on an alternative ansatz starting from the parity - doublet model ( @xcite ) has been quite limited . in this approach",
    ", the scalar sigma meson serves to split the nucleon and its parity partner , while in the chirally restored phase both baryonic states become degenerate but not massless .",
    "this situation is quite analogous to sigma models with hidden gauge symmetry @xcite where the masses of vector and axial vector mesons are split in a similar way to attain degenerate ( but non - zero ) masses in the chirally restored phase similar to the pion and sigma mesons .",
    "it has only quite recently been shown @xcite that with this approach one can obtain saturated nuclear matter with relatively high nuclear compressibilities with a simple potential for the scalar field and a cross - over transition to chiral restoration at large densities . in our investigation",
    "we calculate symmetric nuclear matter and neutron star properties within this framework . in order to get a better understanding of the parameters involved and not just to fix an arbitrary fine - tuned parameter set we vary the parameters over a broad range of values and calculate nuclear matter properties and star masses .",
    "the parameter scan shows that for quite a wide range of values a satisfactory reproduction of nuclear matter binding energy and saturation density is possible .",
    "further demanding that the nuclear matter compressibility lies within a range of reasonable values ( assumed to be between 100 and 400 @xmath0 in the following ) , restricts the parameter space significantly but still allows for a range of values that yield a quantitatively good description of nuclear matter ground state properties in contrast to the results in @xcite . in order to study isospin asymmetric nuclear matter",
    "the rho meson is included in the lagrangian .",
    "its coupling to the nucleons is fixed by the phenomenological value for the asymmetry energy of about 32 mev . by further requiring that the maximum mass of the neutron star , determined by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations , should have a mass around @xmath1 @xmath2",
    ", we find additional restrictions for the allowed model parameters .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "the parity doublet model is briefly introduced in the following section .",
    "we then apply the equations to symmetric nuclear matter and to isospin - asymmetric matter as it is present in neutron stars .",
    "the properties of the model are first tested to fit saturation quantities and then to reproduce observational properties such as the maximum mass of the neutron star .",
    "finally , we discuss the results of this investigation and add some remarks on further work to be done .",

    "the nuclear matter compressibility increases very fast beyond any acceptable value .      in order to study neutron star properties we calculate the equation of state ( eos ) of charge neutral matter including leptons . due to the different densities of neutrons and protons ,",

    "[ kvsm0 ] and reduced repulsion at high densities and consequently lower star masses .",
    "thus , demanding the compressibility to be in a reasonable range , especially not to be too big and in addition , to demand to have a maximum star mass above a phenomenologically acceptable value of at least 1.4 to 1.6 solar masses , restricts the value of @xmath9 to be somewhere between 900 and 870 mev .",
    "thus the initially broad band of possible parameter sets is strongly narrowed by these additional observables .",
    "note , that these values of @xmath9 are quite large , which means that the mass generation is very much different from a standard linear @xmath16 model , where the mass is more or less exclusively generated by the dynamical symmetry breaking , while now most of the mass is generated by the parity - mixing mass term .",
    "the results for neutron stars show that keeping a high mass for the chiral partners and a small coupling constant of the fourth order self interactions of the vectorial fields produce more massive stars , being in agreement with phenomenology .",

    "besides that , if we take into account phenomenological values of compressibility ( allowing for a somewhat wider range @xmath92 ) we find that the mixing parameter @xmath9 has to be @xmath93 so that the two different couplings of the nucleon to the scalar field cancel each other to a large degree .    in a second step the asymmetry between protons and neutrons has been included demanding a charge neutral state ( including the electron ) and the @xmath19 meson coupling constant is determined to reproduce the phenomenological value for the asymmetry energy at saturation .",
