    "in recent years , computational methods based on the lattice - boltzmann equation ( lbe ) have attracted much attention .",
    "they are based on the paradigm of simulating complex emergent physical phenomena by employing minimal discrete kinetic models that represent the interactions and spatial and temporal evolution of quasi - particles on a lattice  @xcite .",
    "originally developed to overcome certain drawbacks such as the presence of statistical noise and the lack of galilean invariance of lattice - gas automaton ( lga )  @xcite , the lattice - boltzmann equation ( lbe )  @xcite has undergone a number of further refinements .",
    "they include enhanced representation of collisions of particle populations through a relaxation process  @xcite which was further simplified by employing the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) approximation  @xcite later  @xcite .",
    "also , its formal connection to the boltzmann equation , developed in the framework of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , was established  @xcite .",
    "the lbe has the beneficial feature that by incorporating physics at scales smaller than macroscopic scales , complex fluid flows such as multiphase flows can be simulated  @xcite .",
    "in particular , phase segregation and interfacial fluid dynamics can be simulated by incorporating inter - particle potentials  @xcite , concepts based on free energy  @xcite or the kinetic theory of dense fluids  @xcite .",
    "the inter - particle potential approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , is an earlier lbe approach for multiphase flows and is based on non - local pseudo - potentials between particle populations . on the other hand ,",
    "free - energy based methods are derived from thermodynamic principles that naturally provide interfacial multiphase flow physics  @xcite .",
    "the lbe approaches based on kinetic theory of dense fluids represent physics based on mean - field interaction forces and exclusion volume effects  @xcite .",
    "more recently , lbe models have also been developed to handle high density ratio problems , which also overcome some of the other limitations of earlier approaches  @xcite . in general , the approaches above employed the bgk approximation to represent the collision process in the lbe and some of their applications in 3d are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the bgk model , a single - relaxation time model , often results in numerical instability when fluids with relatively low viscosities are simulated  @xcite .",
    "the instability problems may be compounded in three - dimensional ( 3d ) flows when physics may not be adequately resolved owing to computational constraints . to address this limitation with the standard lb models ,",
    "several approaches have been proposed . in one approach , known as the entropic lattice boltzmann method(elbe ) , the equilibrium distribution function is defined in such a way that it minimizes a certain convex function , a lyapunov functional designated as the @xmath0function , under the constraint of local conservation laws  @xcite . as a result , it ensures the positivity of the distribution function of particle populations and thus improves the numerical stability .",
    "while this approach is endowed with elegant and desirable physical features , its numerical accuracy is not established and it would incur relatively heavy computational overhead  @xcite .",
    "alternatives to the bgk model have been proposed to improve numerical stability . in the multi - relaxation time ( mrt ) method  @xcite , by choosing different and carefully separated time scales to represent changes in the various physical processes due to collisions , the stability of the lbe can be significantly improved  @xcite .",
    "another interesting approach is the fractional time step method  @xcite . in this approach , stability",
    "is improved by considering fractional propagation of particle populations by reducing time step , which increases computational time . while this approach was employed for the bgk model , the underlying idea is not limited to a particular collision model .",
    "indeed such an approach could be employed in conjunction with the mrt model to further improve stability .",
    "yet another possibility for improving stability is based on the so - called two - relaxation time ( trt ) models ( e.g. ref .",
    "these are variants of the mrt models and can be considered as limiting cases of the more general mrt models .",
    "in addition to the computational advantage of significantly improved stability , the mrt models also have physical advantages in that they are flexible enough to incorporate additional physics that can not be naturally represented by the models based on the bgk approximation .",
    "in contrast to the bgk models , mrt models deal with the moments of the distribution functions , such as momentum and viscous stresses directly .",
    "this moment representation provides a natural and convenient way to express various relaxation processes due to collisions , which often occur at different time scales .",
    "since the bgk model can represent only a single relaxation time for all processes , it can not naturally represent physics in certain complex fluids .",
    "for example , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , bgk models can not represent all the essential physics in viscoelastic flows in 3d .",
    "moreover , mrt models make it possible to incorporate appropriate acoustic and thermal properties through adjustable prandtl numbers for simulating thermo - hydrodynamics by employing a hybrid lbe / finite - difference model  @xcite .",
    "bgk - based models are not able to do so naturally . also , in a more recent work , mrt models have been shown to be capable of handling more general forms of diffusional transport than possible with the bgk model  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the capability of dealing with genuinely anisotropic diffusion problems , their mrt formulation is able to suppress directional artifacts arising due to discrete lattice effects even in isotropic problems .",
    "such features are possible with mrt models because they lend themselves readily to constructing and controlling various models to evolve at rates consistent with the dynamics of physical phenomena of interest .",
    "indeed , approaches based on the mrt representation are inspired by the moment method developed in the seminal work of maxwell  @xcite which was further developed by grad  @xcite .",
    "while prior works have demonstrated the computational advantages of the mrt models for single - phase flows in 2d by lallemand and luo  @xcite and in 3d by dhumires _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and for turbulence modeling  @xcite , it has not been shown for multiphase flows in 3d in previous works .",
    "multiphase flows involve additional physical complexity as a result of interfacial physics involved - i.e. , phase segregation and surface tension effects . in this case",
    ", the accuracy of the numerical discretization of the source terms representing interfacial physics becomes an important consideration and needs to be incorporated carefully into the framework of the mrt model .",
    "these terms should be modeled in a way that , when we establish their relation with the various moments , the dynamical equations in the asymptotic limit should correspond to the desired macroscopic behavior for multiphase flow .",
    "these elements were not considered in single - phase mrt models .",
    "we introduce a second - order discretization of these source terms and avoid implicitness through a transformation which , to our best knowledge , is applied to mrt models for multiphase flows in 3d for the first time in this work .",
    "recently , a mrt model for 2d multiphase problems was developed  @xcite .",
    "there are significant differences in the development and implementation of 2d and 3d mrt models .",
    "these will be discussed below .",
    "furthermore , realistic multiphase flows are 3d in nature and in this work , we develop a 3d mrt model for such problems by employing a model for interfacial physics based on the kinetic theory of dense fluids  @xcite",
    ".    the specific contributions of this work will now be stated .",
    "we develop a 3d mrt model incorporating phase segregation and surface tension effects through source terms discretized by using trapezoidal rule integration and simplified through a transformation to achieve an effectively explicit 3d mrt model for multiphase flows . since the underlying lattice structure for 2d and 3d models are different , the moment basis for the corresponding mrt models are different , and is more complicated in 3d .",
    "we present the theoretical developments based on the 3d moment basis for multiphase flow which , to our best knowledge , has not been considered in prior work .",
    "we derive the continuum equations for multiphase flow from the 3d mrt model through a chapman - enskog analysis  @xcite , provide the dynamical relations between the various moments and forcing terms representing interfacial physics including surface tension forces , develop the relationships between the gradients of momentum fields in terms of the non - equilibrium parts of certain moments and their corresponding relaxation times , and explicitly derive the relationship between the transport coefficients for the fluid flow and appropriate relaxation times . to improve the stability of the approach , the model is then transformed in such a way that compressibility effects are reduced .",
    "furthermore , we evaluate the accuracy and gains in stability of the mrt model for some canonical multiphase problems in 3d .",
    "as the mrt models are endowed with greater computational stability and potential to incorporate additional physics , there is considerable interest in their applications to multiphase problems : the 2d mrt model developed by mccracken and abraham  @xcite extended for axisymmetric problems using the axisymmetric lb model  @xcite has been employed to study the physics of break up of liquid jets  @xcite .",
    "this axisymmetric mrt model and the 3d mrt model developed in this work have also been employed to study the physics of head - on as well as off - center binary drop collisions , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the physically inspired mrt approach developed in this paper also provides a natural framework for incorporating additional physics such as viscoelastic or thermal effects in multiphase flows through an lb model , which are subjects of future work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ mrt3model ] , the 3d mrt lbe multiphase models are developed . in section  [ mrt3macrod ] , the macroscopic dynamical equations of these models are derived by using a chapman - enskog multiscale analysis .",
    "section  [ mrt3modelc ] transforms the model to simulate multiphase flow with reduced compressibility effects . in section  [ mrt3benchmarks ] ,",
    "the model is applied to benchmark problems to evaluate its accuracy and gains in stability .",
    "finally , the paper closes with summary and conclusions in section  [ summary ] .",
    "we develop a mrt model for multiphase flows in which the underlying interfacial physics is based on the kinetic theory of dense fluids . in particular , we consider that the particle populations representing the dense fluids experience mean - field interaction forces and respect enskog effects for dense non - ideal fluids  @xcite .",
    "the effect of collisions of particle populations is represented though a generalized relaxation process in which the distribution functions for discrete velocity directions approach their corresponding local equilibrium values at characteristic time scales given in terms of a generalized collision or scattering matrix .    in the following , we consider subscripts with greek symbols for particle velocity directions and latin symbols for cartesian components of spatial directions .",
    "we assume summation convention for repeated indices for the components of spatial directions .",
    "in addition , unless otherwise stated , we follow the convention that vectors corresponding to three - dimensional position space are represented by non - capitalized symbols with arrowheads ; the vectors with a particle velocity basis are denoted by non - capitalized boldface symbols ; the square matrices constructed from the particle velocity basis are represented by non - boldface capitalized symbols .",
