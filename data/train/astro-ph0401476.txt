    "abrupt changes ( `` glitches '' ) in the spin frequency of rotating neutron stars have been observed to date in radio pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these events appear as sudden increases in the observed pulse frequency , superimposed on more - or - less steady spin - down arising from magneto - dipole braking , and are attributed to a sudden transfer of angular momentum between the superfluid of the interior and the crust @xcite . between glitches the interior superfluid and the crust are relatively loosely coupled , and the braking torque acts primarily on the crust , so that just prior to a glitch the crust is spinning slower than the interior superfluid .    to date",
    "there have been no reports of glitches in accreting pulsars .",
    "here we present the results of a pulse timing analysis of data obtained from _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) observations of the accreting pulsar ks  1947 + 300 , from which we derive orbital parameters as well as the intrinsic spin frequency history of the neutron star .",
    "the latter includes a short time interval during which the pulse frequency increased at an unusually high rate , that may be the first evidence for a frequency glitch similar to those observed in radio pulsars and axps .",
    "the cosmic x - ray source ks  1947 + 300  ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) was first detected on 1989 june 8 with the ttm coded mask imaging spectrometer mounted on _",
    "mir s _ kvant module @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart is a @xmath11 b0ve star with moderate reddening that indicates the distance to the system is @xmath12  kpc @xcite . in 1994",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ detected 18.7  s pulsations from an x - ray source within a few degrees of ks  1947 + 300 . from the batse data , @xcite found that the apparent pulse period of gro  j1948 + 32 , as the pulsating source was designated , varied systematically over the 33  d outburst , indicating that the source was in a binary system with an orbital period between 35 and 44 days . in 2000",
    "november , weak emission from ks  1947 + 300 was detected with the all - sky monitor ( asm ) aboard _",
    "rxte_. a search for periodicities in the @xmath13 yr ensemble of asm measurements of ks  1947 + 300 accumulated up until that time yielded evidence of a @xmath14  day periodicity @xcite .",
    "soon afterwards , pulsations with a period of 18.7  s were found in follow - up observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on _ rxte _ , which showed that ks  1947 + 300  and gro  j1948 + 32 are one and the same @xcite .",
    "a series of _ rxte _ target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations were then conducted which , together with the measurements by the asm , gave excellent coverage over a long and strong outburst .",
    "we made observations of ks  1947 + 300  with all three instruments aboard _",

    "the data from each ssc are analyzed to obtain estimates of the intensities of all the sources listed in the asm analysis catalog within the field of view .",
    "the intensities are expressed as the count rate expected from a source at the center of the field of view of ssc 1 in 1996 march source ( 1.5 - 12 kev ) and has a corresponding energy flux in that energy band of @xmath16 . ]",
    "the asm 1.512  kev intensity measurements of ks  1947 + 300  from 2000 july through 2002 april are shown in fig .",
    "[ asmlc ] .",
    "the source became active in 2000 october and rose to an intensity of approximately 1  @xmath17 around 2000 november 7 ( mjd  51855 ) . following this initial peak",
    "the intensity declined somewhat before beginning a second , more substantial increase which peaked around mjd  51950 at @xmath18 ( approximately 120  mcrab ) . following the outburst maximum , the source declined to @xmath19 , but subsequently exhibited a number of small outbursts peaking at 13  @xmath17 and lasting for 1050  d. the source was not detected by the asm prior to mjd 51800 ; the intensity was @xmath20 .",
    "relatively few measurements were taken around mjd 51960 , and again around mjd 52290 , when the sun was relatively near its closest angular distance of @xmath21 from the source .",
    "in addition , the measurements taken close to those times were more strongly affected by systematic problems than measurements at other times .    in 2000 november ,",
    "shortly after the outburst was noticed in the asm data , a series of observations with the pca and hexte aboard _",
    "rxte_was initiated .",
    "the pca consists of 5 proportional counter units ( pcus ) sensitive to x - ray photons in the range 2.590  kev , each with a collecting area of @xmath22 and a @xmath23 field of view @xcite .",
    "photon arrival times are measured to @xmath24 .",
    "spectra are accumulated in up to 256 energy channels .",
    "the number of pcus operating during the observations varied between 2 and 5 .",
    "the hexte comprises two clusters , each of which contains 4 scintillation detectors sensitive to photons in the range 15250  kev , collimated to view a common @xmath23 field @xcite .",
    "the detectors in the two clusters provide a total collecting area of @xmath25 .    the first pca / hexte observation of ks  1947 + 300  was performed on 2000 november 21 ( mjd 51869 ) .",
    "subsequently , 16  ks long pca / hexte observations were made every 12 days until the end of the main outburst around 2001 june 18 ( mjd 52078 ) .",
    "near the peak of the main outburst two long observations were made ( for proposal i d 50068 , pi : w. heindl ) that yielded 51 and 98  ks of exposure , respectively . in order to obtain a longer baseline for determination of the orbital period ,",
    "an additional series of observations began on 2002 march 29 ( mjd  52362 ) and continued until 2002 may 17 ( mjd  52411 ) . in all",
    ", 132 observations were made with a total observing time of 371  ks .",
    "spectral analysis of the pca and hexte data was undertaken using lheasoft release 5.1 ( 2001 june 26 ) .",
    "the data were first screened to ensure that the center of the fields of view were within @xmath26 of the direction of ks  1947 + 300 and that the limb of the earth was more than @xmath27 from the source direction .",
    "mean energy , i.e. , pulse height , spectra were extracted for each observation from standard observing modes ( `` standard-2 '' , with 129 channels between 260  kev for pca , and `` archive '' , with 64 channels between 15250  kev for hexte ) .",
    "pca spectra were accumulated separately for each pcu .",
    "instrument response matrices were generated for each pcu and each observation using pcarsp .",
    "we estimated background count rates in the pca using either faint or bright source models ( depending upon whether the count rate exceeded @xmath28 ) developed for gain epoch 5 ( from 2000 may 13 onwards ) with pcabackest version 2.1e .",
    "we measured fluxes by integrating model fits to pca and hexte spectra ( see  [ specprof ] ) .",
    "pulse timing analyses were performed using software written by the _ rxte _",
    "team at mit . for timing analysis , the 3 - 12 kev energy range was found to provide nearly optimal signal - to - noise ratios during the faintest observations in which we could detect pulsations .",
    "thus we selected , from `` goodxenon '' mode data , only those events within the energy range 3 - 12 kev detected in the top layer of any pcu , adjusted the times of the events according to the projected distance of the spacecraft from the solar system barycenter , and binned the selected events into 0.25 s time bins .",
    "we fitted various continuum models to pca spectra in the range 225  kev and hexte spectra in the range 1580  kev using xspec version 11.0 . above a flux of @xmath29 ( 260  kev )",
    "the best fit was obtained with a combination of comptonization ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  comptt  in xspec ) and blackbody components , along with a gaussian representing fluorescent fe k@xmath30 emission centered around 6.5  kev .",
    "other models typically used for pulsar spectra , including cutoff or broken power laws , or a power law with a blackbody component , generally gave worse fits . at high count rates ,",
    "systematic errors in the pca response are known to contribute to deviations from the model ; for example , the reduced-@xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for the comptonization model fit to the highest flux spectrum was 3.41 ( i.e. @xmath33 for 150 degrees of freedom ) . adopting a systematic error of 1.7% ( 2% is often used for the pca ) was sufficient to reduce the fit statistic to 1.01 . for comparison ,",
    "a fit with this assumed systematic error and the same gaussian component combined with a power law with a high - energy exponential cutoff gave @xmath34 , while a combination of blackbody and powerlaw components gave 5.29 .",
    "the pca spectrum was significantly softer near the peak of the outburst compared to spectra obtained during the rise and decay ( fig .",
    "[ twospec ] ) .",
    "this was primarily due to a decreased contribution from the @xmath354  kev blackbody component at higher fluxes , rather than a systematic variation in @xmath36 ( for example ) .",
    "while @xmath36 is unusually high for a neutron star , examination of the unfolded spectra suggests that the requirement for the additional component may be due to intrinsic curvature of the approximately power law part of the comptonized spectra .",
    "a similarly good fit was obtained with a very broad ( @xmath37  kev ) gaussian component in place of the blackbody , and we note that the integrated flux is not sensitive to the nature of the additional component .",
    "regardless of whether a blackbody or gaussian component is used , the additional component is strongly required for the best fit .",
    "the fitted column densities of neutral ( unionized ) matter measured over the outburst were consistent with the line - of - sight value estimated from hi / dust surveys , i.e. , @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "thus , to obtain flux estimates we fixed @xmath39 at this value and integrated the best - fit spectral models comprising comptonization and blackbody components over the 2 - 60 kev band .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ asmlc ] . at the peak of the outburst in 2001",
    "february the 260  kev flux was @xmath40 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity was therefore @xmath41 for a source distance of 10  kpc .",
    "to measure the long term frequency evolution of the pulsar we grouped together those _ rxte _ observations    = 8.5 cm    that began within 8  hr of each other and would form a combined data set spanning less than 24  hr . the frequency was then estimated for each set of observations by fitting the 0.25-s time series with the function @xmath42 over a grid of trial frequencies where the coefficients @xmath43 were chosen to obtain the best fit for each frequency @xmath44 .",
    "the accuracy of each frequency measurement was estimated by the range of frequencies where @xmath45 ( equivalent to @xmath46 ) , where @xmath47 was the value of the goodness of fit statistic for the best fit .",
    "we also used pulse frequencies determined from observations performed in 1994 with the batse instrument on the _ compton gamma ray observatory_. the frequencies were obtained in the same way as those reported by @xcite except for being determined from 1-day rather than 2-day data sets .",
    "data for the photon energy range 2060 kev were used in this analysis .",
    "the measured frequencies are shown in fig .",
    "[ period ] . in the @xmath48 year interval between the 1994 and 2000 outbursts the neutron star rotational frequency decreased from 53.47 to 53.30  mhz , corresponding to a mean spin - down rate @xmath49 . during the 20002001 outburst",
    ", there was a substantial overall increase in pulse frequency likely caused by accretion torques on the neutron star .",
    "an approximately sinusoidal periodic    = 8.5 cm    variation is superposed on this increase ; we naturally attribute it to doppler shifts from orbital motion in a binary system .",
    "we fit the frequency measurements with a simple model comprising the effects of neutron star spin including the spin - up due to accretion torques and the apparent changes due to orbital doppler shifts : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the time - dependent stellar spin frequency , @xmath52 is an initial spin frequency for each of the three observation epochs ( batse , _ rxte _ 2000 - 01 , and _ rxte _ 2002 ) denoted symbolically by @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the projected orbital semimajor axis in units of light travel time , and @xmath55 is the orbital period .",
    "the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 are to be interpreted as functions of the eccentricity @xmath58 and the longitude of periastron @xmath44 .",
    "finally , @xmath59 is the mean longitude , with @xmath60 the epoch at which the mean longitude @xmath61 . for a circular orbit",
    ", @xmath60 is the epoch of superior conjunction of the neutron star . the right - most term in parentheses of eqn .",
    "2 represents the orbital doppler shifts to first order in @xmath58 ; given the magnitudes of the uncertainties of our measurements , this should be an adequate approximation as long as @xmath62",
    ".    the neutron star spin frequency may be affected by several physical mechanisms . among these ,",
    "accretion torques are likely to be most important . as a first approximation",
    ", we take the accretion torque to be proportional to a power of the observed x - ray flux , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "this prescription is a limited generalization of models like those of @xcite in which the torque is expected to be proportional to the accretion rate and , in turn , the flux raised to the power @xmath64 .    to obtain a simple model of the x - ray flux @xmath65 , we fitted a composite light curve consisting of daily averages of pca / hexte 2 - 60 kev fluxes and asm 1.5 - 12 kev intensities ( renormalized to 2 - 60 kev fluxes ) with the sum of a set of gaussian components .",
    "the 20002001 outburst was modelled by the sum of 5 components , while the time interval of the 2002 observations was modelled by a single component .",
    "the parameter values defining the model are listed in table [ gaussflux ] .",
    "the individual components that describe the 20002001 outburst , as well as the total model , are plotted with the measured flux values in fig .",
    "[ asmlc ] , lower panel . over the 20002001 outburst , the root - mean - square difference between the measured fluxes and the model comprising five gaussian components ( nos . 2 - 6 of table 1 ) was @xmath66 .",
    "we also adopted an additional gaussian component to represent the flux evolution during the 1994 batse observations .",
    "for that outburst , which lasted around 30  d , the source reached a maximum pulsed 2060  kev flux of around @xmath67 on mjd  49465 @xcite .",
    "broadband pca / hexte spectra from the 20002001 outburst indicate that this likely corresponds to a 260  kev flux of around @xmath68 for a pulse fraction of 50% ( see  [ ptime ] ) .",
    "thus , we included a gaussian component centered on mjd  49465 with a @xmath69 width of 10  d and peak flux of @xmath68 .",
    "we first tried to fit the measured frequencies with a simple model based on eqn . 2 in which the time integral of @xmath70 gives the change in intrinsic spin frequency .",
    "the best fit was poor ( @xmath71 for 101 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "there are a number of possible reasons for this , including ( 1 ) the spacing of the observations does not allow us to construct a flux model that reliably follows flux variations on short time scales ( @xmath7 days ) , ( 2 ) the accretion rate may not be precisely proportional to the x - ray flux , and ( 3 ) the accretion torque in this simple model vanishes when @xmath72 .",
    "the latter property contradicts the observation of a net spin down during the @xmath73 years between the batse and _ rxte _ observations while the source was in quiescence , i.e. while @xmath74 . in order to allow the net model torque to be negative when @xmath72 , we have augmented the spin model with terms linear in time separately for each of the three epochs .",
    "the revised model of the intrinsic spin frequency is thus : @xmath75 where @xmath52 and @xmath76 are the frequency and time , respectively , of the first frequency measurement for epoch @xmath53 and @xmath77 is the 2 - 60 kev flux in units of @xmath78 .",
    "the adjustable parameters @xmath52 and @xmath79 are set independently for each epoch while the power law index @xmath30 and torque coefficient @xmath80 , along with the orbital parameters , are adjustable parameters that apply globally to all three epochs",
    ". further analysis ( see  [ ptime ] ) indicated that there was a rapid change in the intrinsic pulse    = 8.5 cm    frequency around @xmath81 .",
    "we therefore included the term @xmath82 which was assigned a value of zero for all measurements made prior to @xmath83 and a constant value of @xmath84hz for all measurements made afterwards .",
    "the magnitude of this frequency change was determined through a pulse arrival time analysis which is described below , and so was not a free parameter in the frequency model .",
    "the model can be formulated so that it depends linearly on all the adjustable parameters except for @xmath30 and @xmath55 . thus , we searched a grid of points in @xmath30-@xmath55 space to determine the best - fitting parameter combination .",
    "when obtaining the best fit for each @xmath30-@xmath55 pair of values , all other parameters were allowed to vary in a linear @xmath31 fitting process .",
    "the values of the parameters for the best - fit model are listed in table [ orbit ] .",
    "the model fits the data much better than our original simple model described above , although there are still significant residuals ( fig .",
    "[ period ] ) .",
    "this is reflected in the reduced @xmath31 value of @xmath85 .",
    "the fit results unambiguously yield the number of orbital cycles from the epoch of the batse observations to that of the _ rxte _ observations , and thus an accurate orbital period of 40.415  d. we also note that the values of the coefficients @xmath79 , i.e. , the coefficients of the terms representing the values of @xmath86 at zero flux for each epoch , are negative as expected from the spin down inferred during quiescence .",
    "we first estimate the uncertainty in each fitted parameter of the frequency model from the range of values of that parameter that occur within the region defined by @xmath87 that we obtain when all parameters , except @xmath30 , are allowed to vary . here",
    "@xmath88 is the value of @xmath31 per degree of freedom for the best fit .",
    "this @xmath31 contour is that which yields @xmath69 errors when the uncertainties in the individual frequency measurements are scaled to give @xmath89 , assuming correlations in the errors of different measurements are negligible .",
    "these estimates are given in column 4 of table 2 .",
    "these uncertainties do not reflect errors that could occur because ( 1 ) there could be correlations in the errors in the frequency measurements , ( 2 ) the flux model may not be precise , or ( 3 ) the model may not be formulated properly .",
    "we have attempted to crudely estimate the effects of the second possibility and the issue of possible systematic errors in general by varying the parameters describing the flux model one at a time while fixing all other flux model parameters at the values given in table 1 and then redoing the fit for each new set of values . in this exercise",
    "we did not limit the range of values of the modified parameter to those values that give a good fit to the flux data .",
    "the magnitudes of the variation of each derived frequency model parameter in this exercise are given in column 5 of table 2 .",
    "the fitted eccentricity of 0.033 indicates that the orbit is almost circular .",
    "even so , a circular orbit fit ( @xmath90 ) results in a significantly poorer fit ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the formal probability that the fit would yield @xmath92 when the true orbit is perfectly circular is @xmath93 ; this is equivalent to a detection of non - zero @xmath58 with @xmath94 confidence ( cf .",
    "lucy & sweeney 1971 ) .",
    "however , we note that the systematic uncertainty estimated in the exercise described above suggests that the significance of the measured eccentricity is closer to @xmath95 .",
    "the pulse frequency fit takes advantage of the long baseline spanned by the observations , and yields an accurate determination of @xmath55 .",
    "however , that analysis did not take advantage of the relative phases of the pulsations from observation to observation .",
    "we therefore undertook a pulse arrival time analysis of the pca data obtained in the first epoch of _ rxte _  observations .",
    "we first constructed a pulse profile for each observation by folding data in 0.25-s time bins using the pulse period predicted by a preliminary but reasonably accurate frequency model that included both intrinsic frequency changes and orbital doppler shifts .",
    "profiles for selected observations are shown in fig .",
    "the pulse shape evolved as the flux increased and decreased .",
    "at lowest flux the profile exhibited a single peak , with a narrow dip spanning 0.2 in phase forming the primary minimum .",
    "as the flux increased , a shallower secondary dip around 0.25 later in phase developed , so that the profile exhibited one narrow and one broad peak .",
    "the primary minimum also became progressively broader and asymmetric , with a more gradual ingress and egress .",
    "as the flux decreased following the peak , the same systematic variation in pulse profile was retraced in the opposite direction .",
    "for the determination of pulse arrival times , we folded data from 512-s segments .",
    "we defined the pulse arrival time as the epoch of maximum flux , which was determined by fitting a sinusoid to the pulse profile .",
    "the errors in the arrival times were estimated by varying the epoch of maximum flux in the fit over a grid to determine the interval in which @xmath96 .    to make effective use of these arrival times",
    ", one must determine the number of pulsation cycles between each measured pulse arrival time .",
    "thus , we used the preliminary frequency model noted above to estimate cycle counts .",
    "when observations were separated by longer than @xmath97  d it was not possible to unambiguously determine the cycle count using the frequency data alone .",
    "instead , we performed a joint fit of both the frequency and arrival time data . for each long data gap , we fitted both frequencies and arrival times before and after the gap for times as far forward and backward as possible without introducing additional cycle - count ambiguities . using this approach , we were able to determine the cycle counts from mjd  51914 to mjd  52062 .",
    "when the expression on the right in eqn .",
    "3 is substituted into eqn .",
    "[ orbeq ] and integrated , one obtains an expresssion for the pulse phase .",
    "pulse arrival times may then be taken to be the times when the phase is an integer number of cycles .",
    "a constant of integration appears in going from frequency to phase ; it may be taken as the arrival time of a given pulse .",
    "we then fit the arrival times within the range over which we can unambiguously phase - connect the observations , as well as the frequency data before and after .",
    "the best - fit model did not fit the data well , as indicated by the large value of reduced @xmath31 .",
    "one major reason for the lack of agreement between the model and the measured arrival times was an instance , around mjd  51956.4 , where the pulse frequency changed rather rapidly ( see fig .",
    "[ glitchfig ] ) .",
    "the event is apparent in both the frequency measurements and in the arrival time ( or , equivalently , pulse phase ) residuals from a fit calculated using only pulse arrival times prior to the event .",
    "examination of pulse profiles revealed no significant pulse shape change around the time of the event .",
    "the residuals were consistent with a stepwise change of frequency of @xmath98@xmath99hz  occurring around mjd  51956.41  ( such a change is included in the frequency fit ; see  [ fmodel ] ) . in order to obtain limits on the magnitude and duration of this event",
    ", we fit a model to the arrival time data that included a step in frequency @xmath100 that occurred via a constant frequency derivative over a time interval @xmath101 centered at time @xmath83 .",
    "these parameters , as well as low - order polynomial terms in time , were allowed to vary in the fitting process while the orbital parameters and the torque coefficient were fixed at the values determined from the best - fit frequency model .",
    "when this fit was performed on the arrival time data from the 7.8 day time interval mjd 51952.03 through 51959.83 , we obtain @xmath102hz , @xmath103 mjd @xmath104 , and @xmath105 days , where the errors have been scaled by the square root of @xmath106 .",
    "when this fit was performed on the arrival time data from a shorter time interval , i.e. , mjd  51955.6 through mjd 51959.1 , the best fit is obtained for @xmath107hz , @xmath103 mjd @xmath108 , and @xmath109 days , again where the errors have been scaled by the square root of @xmath110 .",
    "the best - fit values of the parameters which describe the glitch    = 8.5 cm    do not appear to depend , within limits , on the length of the data set .",
    "the full sets of model parameters of both fits may be found in table 3 .",
    "we note that the parameters listed in table 3 are consistent with an instantaneous change in frequency .",
    "we measured the flux and pulse frequency evolution of the x - ray pulsar ks  1947 + 300  through a large outburst in 200001 , as well as in a smaller outburst in 2002 .",
    "we fitted the measured pulse frequencies and arrival times to derive orbital parameters , and to determine the temporal variation of the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star .",
    "we found that the pulsar revolves in a nearly circular orbit ( @xmath111 ) with orbital period @xmath1  d , and projected semi - major axis @xmath112  lt - sec .",
    "this orbital period is significantly shorter than that derived from analysis of the pre - outburst asm light curve , @xmath113 days @xcite .",
    "although it is clear that the value based on pulse timing is correct , the basis of the discrepancy is not clear .",
    "we note that the x - ray light curves of other be - star / neutron star binaries sometimes do contain quasiperiodic variations that are asynchronous with the orbits ( e.g. , gs  0834@xmath114430 , wilson et al . 1997 ; xte  j1946 + 274 , wilson et al .",

    "we do not find eclipses in either the asm or the pca light curves , and can confidently conclude that the system is not eclipsing , thus ruling out inclinations @xmath120 .",
    "companion masses @xmath121 5 , 10 , or 20 @xmath118 , imply inclinations of @xmath122 , @xmath123 , or @xmath124 respectively .",
    "this range of masses and inclinations is compatible with the b0ve spectral type of the optical counterpart @xcite .    the wide orbital separation and low eccentricity place ks  1947 + 300  within the small class of neutron stars with high - mass binary companions which almost certainly did not receive large `` kicks '' during the supernovae which led to their formation @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart appears to be a be star that is not highly evolved .",

    "furthermore , the wide separation and relatively small size of the companion suggest that it is unlikely that tidal effects have circularized the orbit since the supernova event wherein the neutron star was formed .",
    "if the pre - supernova orbit was circular , the measured eccentricity @xmath126 suggests that the mass ejected in the supernova must have been rather small , i.e. , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 , the post - supernova system mass , could be as large as @xmath129 .",

    "an outburst of ks  1947 + 300  was seen with batse in 1994 , and no other outburst was reported until that of 20002001 .",
    "batse operated continuously until 2000 may , while the _ rxte _  asm has operated more or less continuously since early 1996 .",
    "batse would most likely have detected any pulsed flux greater than @xmath130  mcrab in the 3075 kev band ( equivalent to a flux @xmath131 ) that was present for more than a few days .",
    "the asm would most likely have detected any outburst longer than @xmath132  d that reached a strength of @xmath133  asm  count  s@xmath5 ( equivalent to @xmath134  mcrab or to a 2 - 12 kev band flux @xmath135 ) .",
    "thus , as was also discussed by @xcite , we can rule out the occurrence of a moderate to strong outburst in the intervening time , although it is possible that weak outbursts could have been missed .    from the end of the outburst in 1994 to the beginning of the outburst in late 2000 ,",
    "the pulsar frequency decreased from 53.47 to 53.30  mhz .",
    "the average frequency derivative during this interval was @xmath136 hz s@xmath5 .",
    "spin - down in quiescence likely arises from the dominance of magnetic torques contributed by field lines which thread the accretion disk outside the corotation radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively",
    ", negative torques may arise from the `` propeller effect '' @xcite .",
    "we note that the magnitude of the quiescent spin - down was comparable to that measured for at least one other pulsar , a  0535 + 26 , of @xmath137 @xcite . while the values of @xmath79 for each epoch ( see table 2 ) are comparable to , or significantly larger than the quiescent spin - down , we caution that it is not correct to interpret these parameters independently from the torque model .",
    "the @xmath79 are coefficients of terms we used to augment the accretion torque integral in equation [ torqeq ] , so as to more accurately model the intrinsic spin changes of the neutron star .",
    "the integral alone would give zero torque only at zero flux , whereas the various negative fitted values of the @xmath79 indicate that zero torque corresponds to non - zero flux at a different level for each epoch .",
    "the 260  kev flux of ks  1947 + 300  peaked at @xmath138 in 2001 february .",
    "this flux implies an x - ray luminosity of @xmath139 for a source distance of 10  kpc .",
    "given this accretion luminosity , a neutron star of mass @xmath140 , radius @xmath141  km , magnetic moment @xmath142 g @xmath143 ( equivalent to an equatorial surface magnetic field strength of @xmath144  g ) , and moment of inertia @xmath145 g @xmath146 , a standard theoretical treatment ( eqn . 15 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicts @xmath147 hz s@xmath5 whereas the intrinsic frequency derivative around the time of maximum flux obtained from our pulse timing results is @xmath148 hz s@xmath5 .",
    "these values are consistent given the simple nature of the theoretical estimate , the possibility of deviations from the assumed neutron star parameters , and the uncertainty in the distance to the system .",
    "we found evidence for a particularly rapid variation of the pulse frequency around mjd  51956.41 .",
    "the phase residuals around this episode were minimized by including a change in frequency of @xmath149@xmath99hz  that occurred at a uniform rate over a time interval @xmath150  hr .",
    "the frequency change corresponds to a fractional change @xmath151  @xmath8 .",
    "if the frequency change occurred at a constant rate over a 10 hr interval , then the intrinsic neutron star pulse frequency derivative must have reached at least @xmath152 , more than twice as large as the maximum inferred from the torque model , @xmath153 .",
    "we note that this event occurred close to the time of peak flux and , therefore , when the accretion torque was near its maximum value .",
    "while it is possible that the abrupt increase in frequency arose from a brief episode of enhanced accretion , we found no evidence for the increase in flux which might be expected as an immediate consequence ( see fig .",
    "[ glitchfig ] ) .",
    "a transient flux increase could have been missed during the @xmath154  hr gap ( mjd  51956.39 to 51956.56 ) between the observations closest to the estimated time of the glitch .",
    "however , the increase in x - ray luminosity required to explain the magnitude of the glitch would be a factor of @xmath155 , sufficient to exceed the eddingon limit for a canonical neutron star at 10  kpc distance .",
    "furthermore , four asm dwells at mjd  51956.51 indicate a flux of @xmath156 , consistent with the level before and after the gap .",
    "this event may have arisen from a sudden change in the spin frequency of the neutron star , analogous to the `` glitches '' observed in other types of neutron stars . however , there are also some significant differences between the glitch in ks  1947 + 300  and those in radio pulsars and axps .",
    "first , in contrast to radio pulsar glitches , which frequently exhibit a change in the spin - down rate @xmath86 following a glitch , we measured consistent values of @xmath86 before and after mjd  51956.41 .",
    "second , the fractional change in frequency of @xmath8  in the ks  1947 + 300  glitch is around an order of magnitude larger than the typical value for `` giant '' glitches in radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "finally , what is more puzzling is that the frequency change in ks  1947 + 300  was in the same sense as the mean spin - up around that time , i.e. the glitch resulted in a brief _ acceleration _ of the spin - up rate by at least a factor of 2 to 3 .",
    "since the neutron star was spinning up at the time of the glitch , one might expect that the core would be rotating more slowly than the crust , so that a glitch would cause a sudden decrease in the pulse frequency .",
    "however , a long history of spin up and spin down episodes may have left the core spinning faster than the crust at the time of the glitch .",
    "the batse observations indeed show that the pulse frequency in 1994 was higher than the pulse frequency at the time of the glitch .",
    "this is the first reported glitch in an accretion - powered pulsar .",
    "if such events occur in other accreting neutron stars , why have they not been detected previously ?",
    "the main reason may be that such events are simply difficult to detect ; indeed , there are a number of conditions which are required for the detection of glitches in either accreting or rotation - powered neutron stars .",
    "the pulsars must be monitored over a period of days , with observations being done at least several times per day .",
    "this is often more difficult to accomplish from space - based x - ray satellites than from ground - based radio observatories .",
    "also , the extraction of pulse frequencies from previous x - ray observations of pulsars have sometimes been done using 1 day or longer integration time intervals , which makes it difficult to detect @xmath157hz frequency changes occurring on time scales of hours or less .",
    "sudden frequency changes could be lost among the other frequency changes from torque variations which typically take place on longer time scales .",
    "we can estimate the sensitivity for the detection of a sudden frequency change from a set of observations .",
    "for this purpose we assume that two estimates of the pulse frequency are made , one before and one after the time of a possible sudden change . for simplicity",
    ", we further assume that each frequency estimate is made from a set of @xmath158 equally - spaced observations made over an interval of length @xmath159 , that each observation yields a phase estimate with @xmath160 uncertainty @xmath161 , and that there are no pulse counting ambiguities left unresolved . in this case",
    "the @xmath160 uncertainty in the difference of the two frequency estimates is given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a factor of order unity .",
    "the length of the time interval @xmath159 over which the frequency estimates are to be made is limited by the frequency changes generally ascribed to accretion torque variability .",
    "equation [ uncert ] indicates that the detection of a @xmath164hz glitch requires , for example , @xmath165 observations over the course of a few days with each observation yielding a modest accuracy phase measurement .",
    "the batse instrument on the compton gamma - ray observatory monitored many accretion - powered pulsars over the course of 9 years with a sensitivity of @xmath166hz per day in favorable cases ( bildsten et al .",
    "frequencies were reported for every day or every few days that pulsations were detected ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997a , finger et al .",
    "1999 , koh et al .",
    "1997 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "though the batse results have not led to the report of any glitch , it is possible that some of the monitored pulsars did exhibit glitches that were not easily noticed because of the large frequency variations on time scales of days and weeks .",
    "a second possibility is that such events may also be quite rare . in this regard",
    ", we note that ks  1947 + 300  was accreting near the eddington limit when this glitch occurred .",
    "if glitches in accretion - powered pulsars only occur under such circumstances , then the opportunities for their detection would be quite limited , since the times when galactic pulsars are observed to be accreting near the eddington limit are relatively infrequent .",
    "clearly , new analyses of archival data and additional observations are called for in order to find other examples of glitches and to determine how often such events occur in accreting neutron stars .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
