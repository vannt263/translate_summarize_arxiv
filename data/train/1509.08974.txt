    "when an electron moves through a metal , it interacts with the phonons of the host lattice .",
    "such electron - phonon interactions were first described by frhlich who introduced a model where the electron emits and reabsorbs phonons @xcite .",
    "when a single electron is considered as a mobile impurity in the crystal , as noted by landau and pekar @xcite , it becomes dressed by a cloud of phonons which it carries along .",
    "the resulting quasiparticle is called a polaron , and compared to the bare electron it has an enhanced mass .",
    "such polaronic mass enhancement is not limited to electrons in solids but is now understood as a generic effect that can be observed in much broader classes of systems , including magnets @xcite or ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "polarons are mostly considered in one out of two physical regimes . for weak couplings the mobile impurity retains",
    "is character and its mass is slightly increased because of the dressing with virtual phonons . for strong couplings , on the other hand ,",
    "the impurity becomes self - trapped inside a sizable potential created by the phonons making up the polaron cloud .",
    "such strong - coupling polarons are extremely heavy and loose their character as mobile impurities almost entirely .",
    "the most interesting physics takes place at intermediate couplings , however , where the impurity acts as an exchange particle mediating interactions between phonons . as a result",
    "the phonons become correlated in this regime and a non - trivial polaronic state is expected @xcite . in this article",
    "we introduce a theoretical method , valid for arbitrary couplings , to describe such correlations quantitatively .    in both regimes of weak and strong coupling efficient theories",
    "exist for describing polarons , see refs.@xcite for reviews . at strong couplings landau and pekar",
    "@xcite used the adiabatic principle and assumed that phonons can follow the impurity instantly . at weak couplings , on the other hand , simple perturbation theory or the more advanced mean - field ( mf )",
    "approach developed by lee , low and pines @xcite can be used . although the theory of polarons is now more than eighty years old , the regime of intermediate couplings is still poorly understood and efficient methods for describing polarons at such couplings are lacking .",
    "the most accurate method is the diagrammatic monte carlo approach @xcite but it only provides limited physical insights .",
    "the most successful semi - analytical all - coupling theory in cases where optical phonons are involved @xcite was developed by feynman @xcite .",
    "he introduced a variational theory , formulated in terms of path integrals , allowing to extrapolate between the weak and strong coupling limits where the lee - low - pines and landau - pekar theories are asymptotically recovered , respectively . due to its restriction to a set of only two variational parameters it is unable to capture all the quantum correlations between phonons which are present at intermediate couplings however .",
    "this was demonstrated by recent diagrammatic monte carlo calculations of the energy of an impurity atom inside an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , where large discrepancies were found to predictions by feynman s variational method @xcite .",
    "recently a new theoretical method was introduced , based on the use of renormalization group ( rg ) techniques , to include phonon - phonon correlations in the description of the polaron cloud @xcite .",
    "it was employed to explain the discrepancies between feynman path integral calculations and numerically exact diagrammatic monte carlo results @xcite by predicting the existence of a peculiar logarithmic divergence of the bec - polaron energy with the ultra - violet ( uv ) momentum cut - off .",
    "it was shown that feynman s method as well as the celebrated strong - coupling theory of landau and pekar are unable to capture the effects of quantum fluctuations in the uv which lead to the log - divergence @xcite . the rg technique developed in ref.@xcite not only yields analytical insights to the polaron problem but it also provides an accurate quantitative description of the ground state from weak to intermediate couplings .",
    "we have identified two main short - comings of the perturbative rg described in ref.@xcite , which will be overcome by the extended rg approach introduced in this article .",
    "first , for strong couplings @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the dimensionless coupling constant ) the ground state energies obtained from the perturbative rg compare poorly with diagrammatic monte carlo results , see fig.[fig : extendedrgenergies ] .",
    "second , in the regime of light impurities at strong couplings , where quantum fluctuations are dominant , the perturbative rg predicts an unphysical divergence of the effective polaron mass , similar to the prediction of a simple perturbation theory in the impurity - phonon coupling . in this article",
    "we show that both these problems originate from the insufficiency of using only perturbation theory in the derivation of the rg flow .",
    "we extended the rg by going beyond perturbation theory _ in every rg step _ , each time effectively summing up an infinite number of diagrams . as a result",
    "we obtain an efficient semi - analytical theory for the polaron which provides an accurate quantitative description of the ground state for arbitrary coupling strengths , see fig.[fig : extendedrgenergies ] .",
    "the key insight is to expand the renormalized hamiltonian around its new mf ground state after every rg step .",
    "this approach is not restricted to frhlich hamiltonians , but may be applied to much broader classes of systems to obtain a quantitative description of correlated ground states from the renormalization group approach in general .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the bogoliubov - frhlich model describing polarons in a weakly interacting bec which we will use to construct the extended rg approach . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methodoverview ] we provide an overview of our method and introduce the coupling constants flowing in the rg protocol . in sec.[sec : results ] we discuss our results for impurity atoms inside a bec and compare them to quantum monte carlo calculations and results obtained using feynman s variational method .",
    "we calculate the phase diagram of the bogoliubov - frhlich model for all values of the two dimensionless coupling constants in two spatial dimensions .",
    "its qualitative shape in the regime where the impurity is much lighter than host bosons is explained in sec.[sec : smallimptmass ] . in sec.[sec : extrg ] we present the detailed derivation of the extended rg method .",
    "we close with a summary and by giving an outlook in sec.[sec : summaryoutlook ] .",
    "traditionally the polaron problem was investigated in the context of solid state physics , however recently impurity atoms immersed in ultracold quantum gases have become an increasingly important model system for studying polaronic effects @xcite .",
    "these ultra clean systems are ideally suited for an investigation of polaron physics because of the powerful experimental tools available and the tunability of many model parameters over a wide range .",
    "the impurity phonon interactions can be controlled using feshbach resonances @xcite and the effective impurity mass can be tuned almost at will by coupling to light fields @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to study a model relevant to ultracold atoms in the following , although our method can be applied to more general classes of systems .",

    "the bogoliubov dispersion is given by @xmath16 .",

    ", in any spatial dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the healing length @xmath13 defines the natural length scale of the bogoliubov - frhlich hamiltonian and @xmath20 the characteristic energy scale .",
    "this leaves only two independent dimensionless coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath21 which fully characterize the model for a given uv cut - off @xmath8 .",
    "in this section we provide a brief overview of our theoretical treatment of the bose polaron problem .",
    "we start from the general frhlich hamiltonian and apply the unitary lee - low - pines transformation @xcite @xmath22 where the total phonon momentum is given by @xmath23 .",
    "we thus switch into the polaron frame where the impurity is localized in the origin . in the new basis the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath24 , which becomes a @xmath25-number and corresponds to the total momentum @xmath26 of the polaron .",
    "it is conserved because of the translational invariance of the system . for more details , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "then , as in the perturbative rg @xcite , we expand around the mf saddle - point solution of the resulting hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "the mf solution corresponds to a wavefunction where the phonons are in coherent states @xmath28 .",
    "the mf amplitude is given by @xcite @xmath29 where the phonon dispersion in the new frame is @xmath30 denotes the mf phonon momentum .",

    "the key idea is to distinguish between fast phonons with momenta @xmath38 form a thin momentum shell @xmath39 , and slow phonons with momenta @xmath40 .",
    "the typical frequency @xmath41 of fast phonons sets the largest energy scale , and the goal is to decouple fast and slow degrees of freedom perturbatively in @xmath42 .",
    "this generates an rg flow of the hamiltonian .    in practice",
    "the decoupling can be performed by applying a series of unitary transformations @xmath43 at each momentum shell .",
    "this was done already in the perturbative rg of ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was found that additional terms are generated in the hamiltonian which are of the type @xmath44 with some function @xmath45 . as a consequence the interactions between phonons , described by the last term in eq .",
    ", no longer involve small fluctuations around the mf saddle point solution of the new hamiltonian .",
    "instead they involve phonons @xmath6 which are subject to the displacement @xmath45 growing during the rg flow .    to ensure that the perturbative decoupling of fast and slow phonons involves the smallest possible fluctuations",
    ", we apply a second unitary transformation @xmath46 after every rg step , by which we change into the basis of fluctuations around the saddle point .",
    "this is done by properly choosing @xmath47 .",
    "hence we displace the slow phonons by an amount @xmath47 which effectively renormalizes the mf amplitude in very rg step .",
    "this is how the extended rg differs from its purely perturbative cousin .      as a result of the extended rg",
    ", the universal hamiltonian takes a simpler form than in the perturbative case @xcite .",
    "below in sec.[sec : extrg ] we will derive rg flow equations for the coupling constants of the following universal hamiltonian at uv cut - off @xmath48 , @xmath49 here @xmath50 denote spatial coordinates which are summed over using einstein convention .",

    "furthermore we defined the following integrals , @xmath66    for the ground state energy we derive the following rg flow equation , @xmath67 this expression was used to calculate the polaron energies shown in fig.[fig : extendedrgenergies ] .",

    "it is defined by expanding the ground state energy @xmath69 with respect to the polaron moment , @xmath70 . in ref.@xcite",
    "we showed using ehrenfest s theorem that the polaron mass can be related to the total phonon momentum in the ground state @xmath71 , @xmath72    the total polaron momentum @xmath73 can be partitioned into a part @xmath74 carried by the impurity and a part @xmath75 carried by the phonon cloud , @xmath76 .",
    "intuitively one expects that both contributions are positive , @xmath77 , which leads to a positive polaron mass @xmath78 . indeed ,",
    "within the fully self - consistent mf theory one can proof that this is always the case , see e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "however in the perturbative rg of ref .",
    "@xcite the phonon momentum @xmath75 is calculated non self - consistently .",
    "we found that small systematic errors @xmath79 lead to slightly negative impurity momenta @xmath80 for light impurities in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "these , in turn , may have the dramatic effect of predicting a large but negative mass for what should be a very heavy polaron but with a positive mass .",
    "in the extended rg approach , on the other hand , the phonon momentum is treated self - consistently because in every rg step the mf amplitude is readjusted , see eq . .",
    "the rg flow equation for the phonon momentum can be derived using the techniques introduced in ref.@xcite . using the self - consistent rg scheme we obtain @xmath81 this differential equation",
    "can readily be solved by noting the close relation to the rg flow equation .",
    "the solution is @xmath82 . from the last result we can now derive for the polaron mass , @xmath83 notably , from this expression",
    "it follows analytically that the polaron mass is always positive . to see this , note that both @xmath73 and @xmath84 are always positive . @xmath85 , on the other hand , starts out negative .",
    "it stays negative during the entire rg flow , because for @xmath86 we obtain @xmath87 and thus there is no rg flow which could make @xmath85 become positive , see eq ..",

    "we compare ground state energies obtained by the rg to recent diagrammatic quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : extendedrgenergies ] .",
    "the extended rg is in excellent agreement with numerically exact monte carlo predictions , where deviations are within the errorbars .",
    "this is the case for all values of the coupling constant ranging well into the strong coupling regime . for comparison ,",
    "feynman s variational approach predicts a transition from weak to strong coupling around @xmath88 for the parameters used in the figure , see ref.@xcite . around this point",
    "we also start to observe deviations of the perturbative rg scheme @xcite from the extended rg .    in fig.[fig : extendedrgpolaronmass ] we show the effective polaron mass as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that the extended rg scheme reproduces correctly the polaron mass at large couplings , where landau and pekar s strong - coupling approach becomes accurate @xcite .",
    "this is remarkable because the rg is constructed as an expansion around the weak coupling solution , where correspondingly the mf prediction is asymptotically approached .",
    "the perturbative rg @xcite , on the other hand , failed to reproduce the polaron mass correctly at large couplings . unlike in the extended rg",
    "the flow of the phonon momentum was treated perturbatively , leading to a divergence of the polaron mass for light impurities . for heavy impurities",
    "the perturbative rg did however capture correctly the qualitative dependence of @xmath89 on @xmath1 , see ref.@xcite .    unlike feynman s variational method , which predicts a sharp transition from weak to strong couplings ( note the double - logarithmic scale in fig.[fig : extendedrgpolaronmass ] )",
    ", we find a smooth cross - over with an extended regime of intermediate couplings .",
    "the same behavior was predicted by the perturbative rg in ref.@xcite . both for weak and strong couplings",

    "<S> the frhlich model describes the interaction of a mobile impurity with a surrounding bath of phonons which leads to the formation of a quasiparticle , the polaron . in this article </S>",
    "<S> an efficient renormalization group approach is presented which provides a description of frhlich polarons in all regimes ranging from weak- to strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the method to the bose polaron problem of an ultracold impurity atom interacting with a background gas that is bose - condensed . </S>",
    "<S> the extended renormalization group approach introduced here is capable to predict ground state properties for arbitrarily small impurity masses . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to obtain the full phase diagram of the corresponding bogoliubov - frhlich hamiltonian , characterized by two dimensionless coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> our method is benchmarked by comparison of the ground state energy to recent diagrammatic quantum monte carlo calculations . </S>"
