    "leland @xcite suggests a simple method for pricing standard european options in markets with proportional transaction costs .",
    "he argues that transaction costs can be accounted for in the option price by increasing the volatility parameter in the classical black - scholes model @xcite .",
    "leland then claims , without giving a mathematically rigorous proof , that the replicating portfolio of the corresponding discrete delta strategy converges to the option payoff as the number of revisions @xmath0 goes to infinity , if the transaction cost rate is a constant independent of @xmath0 , or decreases to zero at the rate @xmath1 .",
    "the latter statement is proved by lott in his phd thesis @xcite .",
    "in fact , this property still holds if the transaction cost coefficient converges to zero at any power rate @xcite .",
    "however , a careful analysis shows that the replicating portfolio does not converge to the option payoff when the cost rate is a constant independent of @xmath0 .",
    "kabanov and safarian @xcite find an explicit limit for the hedging error , which is negative , showing that the replication problem is not completely solved in leland s framework .",
    "pergamenshchikov @xcite obtains a weak convergence for the normalized hedging error and points out that , for the case of constant transaction cost , the rate of convergence in kabanov - safarian s result is @xmath2 .",
    "this limit theorem is of practical importance because it provides the asymptotic distribution of the hedging error .",
    "note that the rate of convergence can be improved using non - uniform revisions @xcite . in these papers , lpinette and his co",
    "- authors suggest a modification to leland s strategy to solve the discrepancy identified by kabanov and safarian . for a recent account of the theory ,",
    "we refer the reader to section [ sec : rev ] and @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we examine the problem of approximate hedging of european style options in stochastic volatility ( sv ) markets with constant transaction costs ( the reader is referred to e.g. @xcite and the references therein for motivations and detailed discussions related to sv models ) . in particular , we establish a weak convergence for the normalized hedging error of leland s strategy using a simple volatility adjustment , in a general sv setting .",
    "the results obtained not only generalize the existing results , but also provide a method for improving the rate of convergence .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that superhedging can be attained by controlling a model parameter .",
    "let us emphasize that the classic form for _ adjusted volatility _ proposed in @xcite and applied in @xcite may not be applicable in sv models .",
    "the reason is that option pricing and hedging are intrinsically different in sv markets than in the classical black - scholes framework . in particular",
    ", the option price now depends on future realizations of the volatility process . in general",
    ", this information may not be statistically available for all investors . to treat this issue",
    ", we suggest a new specification for adjusted volatility in leland s algorithm .",
    "although we employ an artificially modified volatility , simpler than the well - known version used in the previous literature , the same asymptotic results are obtained for sv contexts .",
    "in addition , the rate of convergence can be improved by controlling a model parameter .",
    "note that , in the above - mentioned papers , approximation procedures are mainly based on moment estimates .",
    "this essential technique no longer works in general sv models , unless some intrinsic conditions are imposed on the model parameters @xcite .",
    "it is useful to remember that our goal is to establish a weak convergence for the normalized replicating error which only requires convergence in probability of the approximation terms .",
    "thus , in the approximation procedure , the integrability issue can be avoided in order to keep our model setting as general as possible .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the option price ( inclusive of transaction costs ) in leland s algorithm may be high ( it , in fact , approaches the buy - and - hold price ) , even for small values of the revision number .",
    "another practical advantage of our method is that the option price can be reduced as long as the option seller is willing to take a risk in option replication .",
    "this approach is inspired by the theory of quantile hedging @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : rev ] , we give a brief review of leland s approach .",
    "section [ mar ] is devoted to formulating the problem and presenting our main results .",
    "section [ sec : ap ] presents some direct applications to pricing and hedging .",
    "section [ exa ] discusses common sv models that fulfill our condition on the volatility function . a numerical result for hull - white s model",
    "is also provided for illustration .",
    "section [ hfm ] connects our results to high - frequency markets with proportional transaction costs .",
    "the proofs of our main results are reported in section [ proofs ] .",
    "auxiliary lemmas can be found in the appendix .",
    "in a complete no - arbitrage model ( i.e. , there exists a unique equivalent martingale measure under which the stock price is a martingale ) , options can be completely replicated by a self - financing trading strategy .",
    "the option price , defined as the replication cost , is the initial capital that the investor must invest to obtain a complete hedge .",
    "in fact , the option price can be computed as the expectation of the discounted claim under the unique equivalent martingale measure .",
    "this principle plays a central role in the well - known black - scholes model . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a continuous time model of a two - asset financial market on the time interval @xmath3 $ ] , where the bond price is equal to 1 at all times .",
    "the stock price dynamics follow the stochastic differential equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive constants and @xmath7 is a standard wiener process . as usual , let @xmath8 .",
    "we recall that a financial strategy @xmath9 is an _ admissible self - financing strategy _ if it is bounded from below , @xmath10 - adapted with @xmath11 a.s . , and the portfolio value satisfies @xmath12.\\ ] ] the classic hedging problem is to find an admissible self - financing strategy @xmath13 whose terminal portfolio value exceeds the payoff @xmath14 , or @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the strike price .",
    "the standard pricing principle shows that the option price @xmath17 is given by the well - known formula @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the standard normal distribution function . in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the @xmath22 density : @xmath23 .",
    "one can check directly that @xmath24 by assuming that continuous portfolio adjustments are possible with zero transaction costs , black and scholes @xcite argue that the option payoff can be dynamically replicated using the delta strategy ( i.e. , the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the stock price ) .",
    "it is clear that the assumption of continuous portfolio revision is not realistic .",
    "moreover , continuous trading would be ruinously expensive in the case of nonzero constant proportional transaction costs because the delta strategy has infinite variation .",
    "this simple intuition contradicts the argument of black and scholes that , if trading takes places reasonably frequently , then hedging errors are relatively small .",
    "therefore , option pricing and replication with nonzero trading costs are intrinsically different from those in the black - scholes setting .",
    "note that it may be very costly to assure a given degree of accuracy in replication with transaction costs . in what follow ,",
    "we show that leland s increasing volatility principle @xcite is practically helpful in such contexts .",
    "leland s approach @xcite provides an efficient technique to deal with transaction costs .",
    "this method is simply based on the intuition that transaction costs can be accounted for in the option price as a reasonable extra fee , necessary for the option seller to cover the option return .",
    "it means that in the presence of transaction costs , the option becomes more expensive than in the classic black - scholes framework .",
    "this is intuitively equivalent to an increase in the volatility parameter in the black - scholes formula .",
    "let us shortly describe leland s approach @xcite .",
    "suppose that for each trading activity , the investor has to pay a fee directly proportional to the trading volume , measured in dollar value .",
    "assume that the transaction cost rate is given by the law @xmath25 , where @xmath0 is the number of revisions .",
    "here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are two fixed parameters .",
    "the basic idea of leland s method is to replace the true volatility parameter in the black - scholes model by @xmath28 , artificially modified as @xmath29 in this case , the option price is given by @xmath30 , the black - scholes s formula .",
    "for the problem of option replication , leland suggests the following discrete strategy , known as leland s strategy , @xmath31}{(t_{{\\mathchoice{i-1}{i-1}{\\lower.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstylei-1 $ } } { \\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstylei-1$}}}},t_{{\\mathchoice{i}{i}{\\lower.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstylei$ } } { \\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstylei$}}}}]}{\\lower.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle(t_{{\\mathchoice{i-1}{i-1}{\\lower.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstylei-1 $ } } { \\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstylei-1$}}}},t_{{\\mathchoice{i}{i}{\\lower.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstylei$ } } { \\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstylei$}}}}]$ } } { \\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle(t_{{\\mathchoice{i-1}{i-1}{\\lower.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstylei-1 $ } } { \\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstylei-1$}}}},t_{{\\mathchoice{i}{i}{\\lower.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstylei$ } } { \\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstylei$}}}}]$ } } } } ( t ) , \\quad t_{{\\mathchoice{i}{i}{\\lower.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstylei$ } } { \\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstylei$}}}}=\\frac{i}{n},\\ i\\in\\{1,2, .. ,n\\}.\\ ] ] here , the number of shares held in the interval @xmath32 $ ] is the delta strategy calculated at the left bound of this interval .",
    "then , the replicating portfolio value takes the form @xmath33 where the total trading volume is @xmath34 ( measured in dollar value ) .",
    "recall that the option price @xmath35 is the solution of the black - scholes pde with the adjusted volatility @xmath28 @xmath36 using it s formula , we can represent the tracking error , @xmath37 , as @xmath38    [ re.sec:rev.1-0 ] the specific form results from the following intuition : the lebesgue integral in is clearly well approximated by the riemann sum of the terms @xmath39 , while @xmath40 can be replaced by @xmath41 because @xmath42 .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to expect that the modified volatility defined in will give an appropriate approximation to compensate transaction costs .",
