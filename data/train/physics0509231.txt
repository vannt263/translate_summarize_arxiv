    "the theoretical description of multiphase flows is essentially based on analyzing the reponse of a cloud of dispersed particles of different size ranges in a fluid .",
    "these particles constitute dynamic phases and hence a multiphase flow .",
    "a widely used multiphase system is a bubble column which is a reactor where a discontinuous gas phase in the form of bubbles , moves relative to a continuous phase .",
    "bubble columns have a wide range of applications in chemical industries , biotechnology or in nuclear reactors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , nucreac .",
    "the transient behavior is important at the start - up of these systems and its analysis is essential in order to characterize the dynamic performance of the columns . among the phenomena that occur in these systems",
    "void wave propagation mechanisms are of great importance since many transient and steady states are controlled by the propagation of these waves and , in this sense among others , the dynamic characterization of multiphase flows is essential for the prevention of instabilities .",
    "the ( in)stability of bubbly flows which are characterized by almost uniformly sized bubbles , is usually described in terms of the propagation properties of void fraction and pressure disturbances caused by natural or imposed fluctuations of the rate of air supply @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "bubble size , rise velocity , size distribution and liquid and bubble velocity profile have a direct bearing on the performance of bubble columns . however , most of the time the dispersion devices deliver a dispersed phase with a given size distribution .",
    "the importance of the size distributions is only scarcely evaluated , most of the time by direct empirical trials and its influence on the global behavior has still to be studied . actually , to our knowledge and from the theoretical point of view",
    ", it has not been yet well established whether the stability of the motion of a swarm of bubbles is different for monodispersed or polydispersed bubble flows .",
    "the main objective of this work is to investigate the effects that size polydispersity might produce on the stability of a bubble column .",
    "we shall introduce the effect of polidispersity through the drag force in the hydrodynamic equations , using a method based on statistical concepts and on a point - force approximation @xcite . as we shall see below",
    ", the corrections on the drag force factor , @xmath1 , due to polydispersity depend only on the first three moments of a given particle size distribution and they also have an effect on several properties of kinematic waves . in particular , we found that size polydispersity enhances the stability of void waves by a factor which varies between @xmath2 as a function of frequency and for a particular type of bubble column . in this way our model  predicts effects that might be verified experimentally but this",

    "end the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review a hydrodynamical model for bubbly fluids introduced by biesheuvel and gorissen @xcite .",
    "next , in section 3 we consider a dispersion of spherical air bubbles of different radi in water and we calculate the effect of size polidispersity on the gain factor , mean bubble velocity , kinematic wave velocities as a function of void fraction , for different wave frequencies .",
    "in this section we summarize the main ideas and steps behind the hydrodynamical model for bubbly fluids introduced in ref .",

    "however , this remains to be assessed .",
    "some other important effects remain to be considered as well , like the bubble - bubble interaction mechanisms.nevertheless the approach followed here by including the influence of the distribution through the drag effects , considering a mean field approach , is an attempt to set a first framework for the bubble size distribution incorporation to further studies .",
