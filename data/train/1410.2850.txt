    "optical bright emission lines have been used for many years as the main source of information to derive physical properties and chemical abundances both in nearby and distant galaxies .",
    "these optical emission - lines are excited by the uv radiation emitted by young massive stars in the gas clouds surrounding on - going star - formation complexes in galaxies .",
    "the total metallicity ( @xmath2 ) of the gas - phase is one of the most relevant pieces of information that can be extracted . in particular",
    ", the regime of low metallicity is particularly important in the context of unevolved / young objects resembling the first protogalaxies and or star - formation in the high redshift universe .",
    "the most accurate method to derive @xmath2 using the bright collisionally excited emission - lines is the determination of the total oxygen abundance assuming , e.g. , that the different metals are present in solar proportion .",
    "in addition , the nebular oxygen abundance inferred from emission lines is not the total o since part of the o may be depleted into dust grains .",
    "however , this depletion is negligible small in our galaxies as discussed at the end of section  [ sec : physical_porperties ] .",

    "@xmath3 can be derived from the ratio of lines with different excitation potential ; the most widely used is the ratio of oxygen lines , [ oiii]@xmath44363/([oiii]@xmath5 [ oiii]@xmath6 ) .",
    "then , the ionic abundances of the most abundant oxygen ions is obtained from the ratio of their brightest emission - lines to a hydrogen balmer line , i.e. , [ oii]@xmath43727/h@xmath7 for o@xmath8 and [ oiii]@xmath45007/h@xmath7 for o@xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    unfortunately , the @xmath3 method is often useless at large redshifts due to the faintness of the weak auroral lines and/or because the wavelength coverage does not include the emission - lines required to derive of the observation electron temperature or ionic abundances . in those cases , other methods based only on the brightest available",
    "emission - lines are used instead .",
    "one of the most popular ones is based on the ratio between [ nii]@xmath46584 and h@xmath10 , the so - called n2 parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this parameter involves emission lines close in wavelength so it is almost independent of reddening or flux calibration uncertainties .",
    "n2 presents a linear relation with log(o / h ) , within a range of metallicity including extremely metal poor ( xmp ) galaxies ; see , e.g. , . ] .",
    "moreover , n2 allows measuring o / h in high redshift objects , because the required [ nii ] emission - line appears in many high - z surveys focused on the detection of h@xmath10 in near - ir bands .",
    "other methods widely used to derive o / h based on strong collisional emission lines have revealed to be quite inefficient in the range of xmps .",
    "for instance , the r23 parameter @xcite has a bi - valuated behaviour with o / h in high redshift objects , and o3n2 can not be used for oxygen abundance 12+log(o / h)@xmath118 .",
    "this paper is focused on the empirical o / h estimate using the n2 index in metal - poor galaxies .",
    "we wanted to take advantage of the comprehensive sample of metal - poor galaxies compiled by @xcite to improve the significance of the calibrations o / h versus n2 obtained so far . to our surprise",
    ", we found that the scatter of the relationship o / h versus n2 increases when improving the statistics , and reveals that the ratio [ nii]@xmath46583 to h@xmath10 seems to be independent of metallicity at low oxygen abundance ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath117.6 , which corresponds to a metallicity @xmath12 ) .",
    "this result casts doubts on the metallicities of high - redshift metal - poor objects based on n2 , but indicates that n2 can be used to set an upper limit to the true metallicity of the targets .",
    "this paper describes the problem , the solution , and explains how the behaviour of n2 can be understood using photoionization models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe the sample of 46 xmp galaxies ( section  [ sec : sample ] ) used to calibrate the n2-based empirical metallicity estimate .",
    "the @xmath3 method we use to determine physical properties and chemical abundances is presented in section  [ sec : physical_porperties ] .",
    "the @xmath3 method is employed to determine the chemical abundances of the sample of xmps in section  [ sec : metallicity ] . in order to identify the sources of scatter in the n2 calibration at low metallicities ,",
    "photoionization models are analyzed in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "the sources of the observed scatter are identified in section  [ sec : results_empiric ] .",
    "a summary with conclusions and follow - up work is provided in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in order to calibrate the index n2 in the very low - z range , we need a large sample of low - z targets with their o / h homogeneously determined via the direct method .",
    "we start off from the metal - poor galaxy sample compiled by @xcite , which included all galaxies with metallicity one tenth or less of the solar value found to the date of publication .",
    "the total sample includes 140 xmps . among them , 79 have spectra in sdss / dr7 , which is the spectral database used in the calibration .",
    "nearby galaxies with spectra in sdss ( objects with @xmath13 ) have [ oii]@xmath43727 out of the observed spectral range , thus the determination of the @xmath14 by the direct method , i.e. , using [ oii]@xmath43727 , is not possible .",
    "a slight modification of the direct method allows to calculate the value of @xmath14 from the intensities of the auroral lines [ oii]@xmath157320,7330 @xcite and was explored .",
    "it is important , however , to bear in mind that the application of the auroral line method is restricted to spectra with sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio @xcite . because of this , we select galaxies with s / n @xmath16 3 in [ oii]@xmath47320",
    ". only 31 of the 79 metal - poor galaxies with sdss spectra fulfill the required s / n criterion .",
    "we added 15 galaxies to the sample taking into account the similarity between n and o ionization structures . with",
    "n / o obtained using the n2s2 index @xcite and @xmath17 inferred through the functional form by @xcite , it is possible to estimate @xmath14 when [ oii ] lines are unavailable . in summary",
    ", we have 46 xmp galaxies with their metallicities determined in a homogeneous and consistent way , which is the main sample employed in this paper .",
    "in order to put our work into context , we also randomly select and analyze a control sample of 65 starburst galaxies , having intermediate metallicities ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we first select those emission line galaxies in sdss / dr7 which were not classified as metal - poor galaxies by @xcite .",
    "then , we discarded agns using the bpt diagram @xcite .",
    "finally , we divided the range of n2 roughly corresponding to @xmath18 in 65 equal intervals , and then one galaxy was randomly selected per interval .",
    "the emission - line fluxes of the spectra of the 46 xmps and the 65 galaxies in the control sample are measured using our own idl procedure to better control the errors and their propagation .",
    "basically , the procedure works as the task splot in iraf . in the case of an isolated line or two blended unresolved lines",
    ", they are measured integrating between two points given by the position of the local continuum identified by eye . if two lines are blended , but they can be resolved , we use a multiple gaussian fit to estimate individual fluxes .",
    "the statistical error associated with the observed emission lines is calculated using the expression @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] @xcite , where @xmath20 is the error in the observed line flux , @xmath21 corresponds to the noise in the continuum near the measured emission line , @xmath22 is the number of pixels used in the measurement of the line flux , @xmath23 is the line equivalent width , and @xmath24 is the wavelength dispersion .    all line fluxes were corrected for reddening using the same procedures as in @xcite .",
    "the reddening coefficient in h@xmath25 , @xmath26 , was calculated assuming the extinction law of @xcite for the galaxy and performing a least - squares fit to the difference between the theoretical and observed balmer decrement .",
