    "the most basic features of neutron stars ( ns ) are their radii and masses which so far have not been well determined simultaneously for a single object . in some cases",
    "masses are precisely measured like in the case of binary systems but radii are quite uncertain . in the other hand , for isolated ns",
    "some radius and mass measurements exist but lack the necessary precision to inquire into their interiors .",
    "in fact , it has been conjectured that there exists a unique relationship for all ns between the sequence of mass and radius relations on the one hand and their equation of state ( eos ) on the other that determines their internal composition @xcite .",
    "for this reason , accurate observations of masses and radii are crucial to study cold dense nuclear matter as it exists in ns .",
    "however , the present observable data allow to make only probabilistic estimations of the internal structure of the star which can be performed using bayesian analysis ( ba ) and modeling of relativistic configurations of ns . in comparison to previous work in this direction",
    "@xcite we choose disjunct mass - radius constraints in this work which reveals that probabilistic estimations of the superdense stellar matter eos have a much more preliminary character at present than obtained previously .",
    "moreover , we focus in this analysis on investigating the possibility of a quark matter inner core in massive ns with @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) , separated from the outer core of hadronic matter by a strong first order phase transition .",
    "the microscopical properties of compact stars are modeled in the framework of general relativity , where the einstein equations are solved for a static ( non - rotating ) , spherical star resulting in the tolman  oppenheimer ",
    "volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite , see also @xcite    @xmath1    as well as the equation for the baryon mass profile @xmath2 of the star @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the atomic mass unit and the constants are defined as @xmath5    these equations are integrated from the center of the star towards its surface , with the radius of the star @xmath6 defined by the condition @xmath7 while the gravitational mass is @xmath8 . in a similar manner , the baryon mass is given by @xmath9 .",
    "in order to solve the tov equations the eos is required .",
    "it is given by the relation @xmath10 which carries information about the microscopic state of dense nuclear matter .",
    "thus , the above equations have to be solved simultaneously using as a boundary condition the energy density at the star centre @xmath11 .    in this way , for a given value of @xmath12 the solution of the tov equations are the @xmath13 and @xmath14 profiles and with them the relation @xmath15 in the parametric form @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for this study we follow the ahp scheme  @xcite for defining the hybrid eos in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pressure of a pure hadronic eos and @xmath20 represents the high density eos assumed here as quark matter with @xmath21 , its squared speed of sound , as parametrized by haensel et al .",
    "@xcite which describes pretty well the superconducting njl model derived in  @xcite . for the hadronic eos",
    "we take the well known model of apr  @xcite that is in agreement with experimental data of densities about nuclear saturation . for this hadronic branch",
    "all the relevant thermodynamical variables : energy density @xmath22 , pressure @xmath23 , baryon density @xmath24 and chemical potential @xmath25 are well defined and taken as input for determination of the hybrid ( hadronic + quark matter ) eos . as a starting point in the derivation of the high density eos",
    "we introduce the pressure as function of energy density in the quark matter phase @xmath26 with @xmath27 playing the role of a bag constant . to determine the remaining thermodynamical quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the quark matter phase we use the following relations @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the quark matter energy density right after the phase transition following the jump @xmath32 as density increases .",
    "therefore one arrives at the following formula @xmath33 obtained by enforcing conditions of equal pressure and chemical potential at the transition ( gibbs conditions ) : @xmath34 where upper case subscripts stand for the values of the thermodynamic functions at the phase transition : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc .",
    "@xmath39{aph_scheme_2models.pdf}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=7cm]{aph_scheme_2models_2.pdf } \\end{array}$ ]    the free parametes of the model are the transition density @xmath40 , the energy density jump @xmath41 and @xmath21 , the quark matter speed of sound squared .",
    "the resulting eos in the plane pressure versus density is depicted in fig .",
    "[ aph_scheme ] for a given set of input parameters .",
    "we define the vector of free parameters @xmath42 , which define the eos with phase transition from nuclear to quark matter .",
    "the nuclear equation of state can be taken to be  apr  @xcite .",
    "these parameters were sampled as @xmath43 where @xmath44 with @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , here @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 number of parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "using the eos one can calculate the neutron star structure by solving the tov equations .",
    "then it is possible to use different neutron star observations to check the probability for this eos .",
    "we use here three observations as constraints : a mass constraint  @xcite , a radius constraint  @xcite and a constraint for the gravitational binding energy ( relation between gravtitational mass and baryon mass )  @xcite .",
    "the goal is to find the set of the most probable @xmath56 based on the given constraints using bayesian analysis ( ba ) . for initializing the ba",
    "we propose that _ a priori _ each vector of parameters @xmath56 has a probability equal to one , @xmath57 , for all @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that error of the mass measurement for the high - mass pulsar psr  j0348 + 0432  @xcite is normal distributed with @xmath59 , where the mean value is @xmath60 and the variance is @xmath61 .",
    "using this assumption we can calculate the conditional probability of the event @xmath62 that the mass of a neutron star corresponds to measurement : @xmath63 where @xmath64 - maximal mass constructed by @xmath56 and @xmath65 is the cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution @xmath66.\\ ] ]      in the ba by steiner et al .",
    "@xcite the luminosity radius extracted for burst sources has been used to constrain a combined mass - radius relationship .",
    "this method is problematic , in particular because of the unknown stellar atmosphere composition , uncertainties in the distance to the source , the bias of the parabolic m - r constraint with the shape of stellar sequences in the m - r diagram for typical eos and last not least due to unknown details of the burst mechanism .",
    "a very promising technique to measure radii of neutron stars is based on the analysis of pulsar timing residuals since it does not rely on knowledge of the luminosity of thermal radiation .",
    "such a radius measurement gives @xmath67 and @xmath68 for psr  j0437 - 4715  @xcite .",
    "a similar range of radius values has recently been obtained for rxj 1856 by hambaryan et al .",
    "now it is possible to calculate the conditional probability of the event @xmath69 that the radius of neutron star corresponds to the given measurement @xmath70      this constraint corresponds to a region in the @xmath71@xmath72 plane .",
    "we need to estimate the probability that a point @xmath73 is close to the point @xmath74 .",
    "the mean values @xmath75 , @xmath76 and standard deviations @xmath77 , @xmath78 are given in @xcite .",
    "the needed probability can be calculated by the formula @xmath79 \\left [ \\phi\\left(\\xi_b\\right ) - \\phi\\left(-\\xi_b\\right ) \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the absolute values of the components of the vector @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 is given in @xcite and @xmath87 is the solution of the tov equations using the @xmath88 vector of eos parameters @xmath56 .",
    "note that formula ( [ p_kitaura ] ) does not correspond to a multivariate normal distribution .",
    "note , that these measurements are independent of each other .",
    "this means that we can calculate the complete conditional probability of an event @xmath89 given @xmath56 corresponds to the product of the conditional probabilities of all measurements , in our case resulting from the three constraints @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 now , we can calculate the probability of @xmath56 using bayes theorem : @xmath94    @xmath95{mvsr_apr_cat_10x10x10.pdf}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{mvsr_apr_cat_1000.pdf } \\\\",

    "we apply the scheme of ba for the probabilistic estimation of the eos given by the vector parameter @xmath96 . varying the parameters in the intervals",

    "the mass - radius relation is shown in the upper panel and the pressure as a function of the energy density is in the lower one .",
    "the results are shown for different sets of neutron star configurations corresponding to different sets of eos parameters .",
    "the thickness of the lines is chosen to be proportional to the probability value for the parameter vector @xmath96 .",
    "we  show that the chosen constraints are not sufficient to distinguish two cases : the one with the existence of a third family of twin stars ( two stars with same masses but different radii due to different internal composition ) from the case where only neutron star family is possible .",
    "this result can also be obtained from the lower panel of fig",
    ".  [ results ] where the eos are plotted with different line thickness corresponding to the probability value for the parameter vector @xmath96 .",
    "it is apparent that the two types of eos , with and without the phase transition to quark matter , have approximately the same probability .",
    "nevertheless , when the phase transition to quark matter is possible then our constraint requires that the phase transition should occur for energy densities exceeding @xmath101 with a jump in energy density up to @xmath102 .",
    "we conclude that the current state of knowledge of observables for masses and radii of compact stars does not yet allow to extract with certainty a statement about the possible existence of a quark matter inner core with a strong first order phase transition to the outer core .",
