    "density matrices have found an interesting new application in recent years . in the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )",
    "method @xcite a quantum system is built from smaller parts and the idea is to work with basis functions in these parts which are optimal for the combined system .",
    "these are the eigenfunctions of the reduced density matrices which have the largest eigenvalues @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , the procedure will work well if the eigenvalue spectrum drops rapidly , such that a small number of functions practically exhausts the sum rule @xmath1 .",
    "for quantum chains this is indeed the case .",
    "the numerical calculations show a roughly exponential decrease of the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "of course , this raises the question whether such spectra can be obtained explicitely for some solvable models . for non - critical systems",
    "this is possible by using the relation @xcite between the density matrices of quantum chains and the corner transfer matrices ( ctm s ) @xcite of the corresponding two - dimensional classical problems . in this way",
    ", the spectra for the transverse ising chain @xcite , the xxz heisenberg chain @xcite and a chain of coupled oscillators @xcite could be determined in the thermodynamic limit and compared with dmrg calculations . in all these cases , one finds simple analytic expressions and , apart from degeneracies , a strictly exponential behaviour .",
    "this does not hold for the chiral three - state potts chain @xcite or for non - integrable models @xcite , but qualitatively the spectra are similar .    given the importance of fermionic systems in general and also for dmrg applications , one would of course like to have results for this case , too",
    ". the transverse ising chain can be viewed as a fermionic model , but the ctm approach does not make use of this and is limited to large non - critical systems . therefore an alternative approach is necessary by which one can treat solvable fermion systems of arbitrary size . in the present communication",
    "we show how this can be done .",
    "the systems which we consider are non - interacting , such that the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation . using an explicit form of the state in question ( usually the ground state ) ,",
    "we show that arbitrary reduced density matrices can be calculated exactly and have the general form @xmath2 .",
    "the operator @xmath3 describes a collection of new , non - interacting fermions with single - particle eigenvalues @xmath4 .",
    "apart from the different statistics , this is the same situation as for coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 , which determine the properties of the spectrum , follow from the eigenvalues of an @xmath5 matrix , where @xmath6 is the number of sites in the chosen subsystem .",
    "in general , they have to be calculated numerically .",
    "one should stress that the dimensionality of the system plays no essential role .    in the following section [ sec : two ] we sketch the general method of computation which uses coherent fermionic states for calculating the necessary partial traces . in section [ sec :",
    "three ] , we apply it to the transverse ising chain and discuss the resulting spectra for a number of situations , including the critical case , the first excited state and related row transfer matrices .",
    "section [ sec : four ] deals briefly with another one - dimensional problem , namely the spin one - half xy - chain in a field .",
    "this is interesting because it has a disorder point where the spectrum collapses . in section [ sec : five ] we turn to the physically most important case of a tight - binding model which we dicuss in two dimensions .",
    "we present spectra for systems of various sizes and shapes , as well as truncation errors showing the difficulties in this case .",
    "section [ sec : six ] , finally , contains a summary and some additional remarks .",
    "some technical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "we consider hamiltonians which are quadratic in fermi operators and thus have the general form @xmath7         \\label{eqn : ham}\\ ] ] where the @xmath8 s and @xmath9 s are fermi annihilation and creation operators . because of the hermiticity of @xmath10 , the matrix @xmath11 is hermitian and @xmath12 is antisymmetric . in the following we consider only real matrices .",
    "one can diagonalize @xmath10 through the canonical transformation@xcite @xmath13 which leads to @xmath14 the quantities @xmath15 are the eigenvalues of the matrices ( @xmath16)(@xmath17 ) and ( @xmath17)(@xmath16 ) , the corresponding eigenvectors being @xmath18 and @xmath19,respectively .",
    "consider now the ground state @xmath20 of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : ham ] ) for an even number of sites @xmath21 .",
    "due to the structure of @xmath10 , it is a superposition of configurations with either an even or an odd number of fermions .",
    "this suggests to write it ( for the even case ) in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vacuum of the @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath24 such an exponential form is known from superconductivity , where the bcs wave function ( in momentum space ) can be written in this way @xcite .",
    "one obtains @xmath25 by applying the fermi operators @xmath26 to the ground state @xmath27 which leads to ( see appendix ) @xmath28 thus @xmath29 relates the two matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the transformation ( [ eqn : bogoliubov ] ) . using ( [ eqn : gsconf ] ) , one obtains the total density matrix @xmath32 explicitly in an exponential form @xmath33    one now divides the total system in two parts ( system and environment in the dmrg terminology ) and looks for the reduced density matrix in part 1 .",
    "this is obtained by taking the trace over part 2 .",
    "@xmath34 in order to calculate @xmath35 , one uses the fermionic coherent states defined by @xcite @xmath36 such states can be built from the vacuum with operators @xmath8 and grassmann variables @xmath37 @xmath38 using this , one can write the trace of an operator @xmath39 as @xmath40    after forming a general matrix element of @xmath41 with such states and taking the trace over the environment with ( [ eqn : trace ] ) , one obtains , if part 1 consists of @xmath6 sites @xmath42 inserting ( [ eqn : rho0 ] ) leads to an integrand which contains only quadratic forms of grassmann variables in the exponents .",
    "the integration can then be carried out by rotating and displacing the variables as for a gaussian integral with complex numbers .",
    "this gives @xmath43 the @xmath44 matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 appearing here are defined as follows .",
    "one divides @xmath29 into four submatrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 , according to whether the sites @xmath49 belong to part 1 or part 2 . in terms of these @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denotes its transpose .",
    "as shown in the appendix one can reconstruct the operator form of @xmath35 from the matrix elements ( [ eqn : gve ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath53 finally , since the fermi operators appear quadratic in the exponents , @xmath35 can be diagonalized with a bogoliubov transformation as in ( [ eqn : bogoliubov ] ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath54 with new fermi operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the single - particle eigenvalues @xmath4 follow from the matrices @xmath57 according to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : eigen ] ) of the appendix .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath58 is fixed by the sum rule @xmath59 . in this way",
    ", one can calculate the density - matrix spectra numerically for an arbitary part of a finite system with hamiltonian ( [ eqn : ham ] ) .",
    "as a first example , we consider in this section the transverse ising chain with open boundaries described by h = -_i=1^l^z_i-_i=1^l-1 ^x_i ^x_i+1 [ eqn : transi ] where the @xmath60 are pauli spin matrices and the transverse field has been set equal to one . in the thermodynamic limit , this system has a quantum critical point at @xmath61 and long - range order in @xmath62 for @xmath63 . in terms of spinless fermions",
    "h reads h = -2_i=1^l ( c_i^c_i-1/2)- _ i=1^l-1 ( c_i^-c_i)(c_i+1^+c_i+1 ) [ eqn : ftim ] and thus has the form ( [ eqn : ham ] ) . in the following",
    "we discuss the reduced density matrix @xmath35 for one half of the chain , i.e. @xmath64 .",
    "we first consider the ground state . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the single - particle eigenvalues @xmath4 are plotted for @xmath65 and different coupling constants @xmath66 . for @xmath67 they all lie on a straight line , which corresponds to the situation one finds in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is what one expects since the correlation length is much less than @xmath21 and hence boundary effects should be small .",
    "one can also check that the values are exactly those obtained analytically via corner transfer matrices @xcite .",
    "it seems to be difficult , however , to derive these results directly from our equations . for larger coupling , @xmath68 , only the first @xmath4 follow a linear law ,",
    "then the curve bends upwards .",
    "this is similar to the behaviour one finds for finite - size corner transfer matrices @xcite , although the geometry there is different . at the same time , the initial slope decreases .",
    "finally , at the critical point , the whole graph is curved . in the ordered region (",
    "not shown ) , a linear regime develops again .    from the @xmath4 one obtains the actual eigenvalues @xmath0 of @xmath35 by specifying the occupation numbers @xmath69 in ( [ eqn : rho1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure [ fig2 ] in a semi - logarithmic plot .",
    "note that not all @xmath0 are shown , however they are correctly normalized to one . similar results , but for a smaller number of @xmath0 , were obtained in @xcite via dmrg calculations . due to the relatively large values of the @xmath4",
    "there is a rather rapid decay ( note the vertical scale ) so that the system can be treated very well by dmrg @xcite .",
    "this holds even at the critical point , where the decay is slowest .",
    "the situation there is presented in more detail in the next figures .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath70-spectra for various sizes of the system . as @xmath21 increases , the number of @xmath70 increases , the curves become flatter , but the curvature remains .",
    "there is no sign of a linear region related to conformal invariance on this scale ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra are plotted in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "because of the form of the @xmath70 , there are few degeneracies and the curves have the typical , relatively smooth shape found also for other critical systems @xcite .",
    "the finite - size effects show up essentially in the tails .",
    "so far , we have treated the ground state , but one can also determine the density matrices for the first excited state @xmath71 .",
    "this state contains an odd number of fermions . to apply the formalism here",
    ", one can perform a particle - hole transformation at one site , e.g. @xmath72",
    ". then @xmath71 appears in the even subspace and can be written in the form ( [ eqn : gsconf ] ) . with the help of the relations @xmath73",
    "one can then derive the corresponding equation for the matrix @xmath25 . in this way",
    ", the single - particle eigenvalues @xmath4 shown in figure [ fig5 ] were obtained .",
    "in contrast to the case of the ground state , the first eigenvalue is zero here .",
    "this reflects the fact that , in the original representation , the fermion number is odd , while the number of sites is even .",
    "the other eigenvalues are very similar to those for the ground state .",
    "in particular , one has a linear spectrum away from @xmath74 and a curved one at the critical point . the vanishing @xmath75 causes all eigenvalues @xmath0 of @xmath35 to be at least doubly degenerate .",
    "finally , the closely related problem of the row - to - row transfer matrices for the two - dimensional ising model can be studied in the same way . for a square lattice with couplings @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) in the vertical ( horizontal ) direction",
    "one can consider two symmetrized versions , namely v = v_2 ^ 1/2 v_1 v_2 ^ 1/2 ; w = v_1 ^ 1/2 v_2 v_1 ^ 1/2 where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) contain the vertical ( horizontal ) bonds .",
    "both represent fermionic quantum chains and can be diagonalized also for open boundaries @xcite .",
    "for the thermodynamics , one needs the eigenvector with maximal eigenvalue .",
    "dmrg calculations using the operator @xmath80 have already been done @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath4 in the isotropic case @xmath81 is very similar to that found above in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this also holds for the magnitude of the @xmath4 and the problem can therefore be treated equally well by dmrg .",
    "for @xmath82 the @xmath70-spectrum is strictly linear at the lower end and described by a formula containing elliptic integrals as in @xcite , while for @xmath80 the values are somewhat smaller and there is a deviation from linearity for the first @xmath4 .",
    "this reflects the difference in the representation of @xmath35 via ctm s in the two cases .",
    "in this section we consider briefly the spin one - half quantum chain described by the hamiltonian h = -j/2 _ i=1^l-1 [ ( 1+)_i^x_i+1^x + ( 1- ) _",
    "i^y_i+1^y+ h(_i^z+ _",
    "i+1^z ) ] [ equ : hxy ] which reads in terms of fermions h = -j _ i=1^l-1 [ ( c_i^c_i+1 + c_i^c_i+1^ + h.c . ) + h ( c_i^c_i+c_i+1^c_i+1 - 1 ) ] although similar to the transverse ising chain , this system has a special feature . for ^2 + h^2 = 1 [ equ : disorder ]",
    "the ground state simplifies and also becomes two - fold degenerate . in the spin language ,",
    "one has two simple product states @xcite .",
    "moreover , the behaviour of correlation functions changes from monotonic to oscillatory @xcite and thus ( [ equ : disorder ] ) represents a `` disorder line '' @xcite . on this line",
    ", @xmath10 describes also a stochastic reaction - diffusion model @xcite equivalent to glauber s kinetic spin model .",
    "the appearance of a simple ground state can be observed in the density - matrix spectrum and has already been seen in dmrg calculations for certain other models ( see section 3.1 in @xcite ) . for the @xmath83-chain",
    ", it can be investigated very well in the fermionic approach .    in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the lowest @xmath4-values as a function of the parameter @xmath31 for fixed @xmath84 .",
    "the disorder point according to ( [ equ : disorder ] ) is then at @xmath85 .",
    "one can see that , coming from larger values of @xmath31 , all @xmath4 except the lowest one diverge as one approaches @xmath86 .",
    "for @xmath87 they become finite again . in this region",
    ", however , one has to work in another subspace since at @xmath86 the lowest fermionic eigenvalue @xmath88 in @xmath10 crosses zero , which leads to the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "this can be done as for the excited state in section [ sec : three ] .",
    "then one finds the curves in the figure . as a check we also performed direct dmrg calculations and found complete agreement ( dots ) .",
    "such crossings appear repeatedly as one reduces @xmath31 further .",
    "the next one ( for the chosen @xmath21 ) takes place at @xmath89 .",
    "however , as seen from the figure , the higher @xmath4 show no effects at this point , indicating that the ground state of @xmath10 does not simplify there . at @xmath86 , the divergence of the @xmath4 for @xmath90 together with the value @xmath91",
    "lead to the density - matrix eigenvalues @xmath92 , while all other @xmath0 are zero , i.e. the spectrum collapses at this point .",
    "this effect could be a tool in the search for simple ground states by dmrg .",
    "as the last , but most important example we consider a tight - binding model with open boundaries described by h=-_<*i , j * > ( c_*i*^ c_*j * + c_*j*^ c_*i * ) [ eqn : tb ] where the brackets @xmath93 denote nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "this model is critical and solvable in all dimensions .",
    "we treat it here for the case of a square lattice and we assume that the system also has the shape of a square with @xmath94 sites where @xmath95 is even . this problem has has served as a dmrg test case some time ago @xcite .",
    "the ground state here is different from that in the previous sections . because @xmath10 only contains hopping , @xmath96 in equ.([eqn : ham ] )",
    ", the fermion number is fixed and @xmath97 does not have the form ( [ eqn : gsconf ] ) .",
    "however , one can perform a particle - hole transformation on @xmath98 sites , for example on every second one , by which the hamiltonian acquires pair creation and annihilation terms ( @xmath99 )",
    ". then @xmath20 , which originally contains @xmath98 particles , becomes a superposition of terms with particle numbers ranging from @xmath100 to @xmath21 and can again be written in the form ( [ eqn : gsconf ] ) . in the same way",
    ", an arbitrary @xmath101-particle eigenstate of h could be handled by exchanging particles and holes at @xmath101 sites .",
    "the density - matrix spectrum is not affected by such local transformations .",
    "to carry out the calculation , one makes the problem formally one - dimensional by numbering the sites from 1 to @xmath21 in such a way that the desired partition into two parts arises naturally .",
    "for example , a meander - like numbering as in @xcite permits a division of the square into two halves .    in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , the single - particle eigenvalues @xmath4 for such a half - system and three different sizes are shown .",
    "one notices two features which are in contrast to the one - dimensional results : a `` foot '' of low - lying @xmath4 and a much smaller slope of the curves ( note the scales ) .",
    "both are strongly size - dependent .",
    "the number of @xmath4 in the foot is equal to @xmath95 , which indicates that these states are closely connected with the interface between system and environment .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the first 2000 eigenvalues @xmath0 which result . due to the small @xmath4",
    ", they decrease very slowly and the situation worsens as the system is enlarged .",
    "the tails of the curves can be described qualitatively by @xmath102 as in @xcite .",
    "the effect of these tails shows up even more in the truncation error @xmath103 , which is defined as the sum of all @xmath104 s beyond @xmath101 .",
    "this quantity is given in the inset of the figure .",
    "with @xmath105 it is approximately @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "thus the situation is not only much worse than for one - dimensional systems , but also worse than for the two - dimensional system with a gap discussed in @xcite .",
    "standard dmrg calculations using , say , 2000 states would be limited to sizes below @xmath109 , and even then the accuracy would be much less than one is used to in quantum chains",
    ".    one can also calculate the density - matrix spectra for other shapes of the selected subsystem . as an illustration",
    ", we show in figure [ fig9 ] results for one quarter of a quadratic system ( for example the upper right one ) .",
    "note that the sizes indicated there refer to the whole system .",
    "one sees again some small eigenvalues , but fewer than for the half - system , while there are further higher - lying plateaus and additional short steps .",
    "obviously this reflects the particular interface with a corner . for the @xmath110 system , for example",
    ", the two lowest plateaus contain 9 states which is just the number of sites along the interface .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath0 are plotted in the inset of the figure .",
    "they are similar to those for the half - system but some more steps persist for small @xmath101 . in the same way , one can investigate cases where one cuts the square diagonally at various positions .",
    "such partitions appear in a recent new dmrg algorithm @xcite .",
    "the general features of the spectra , however , do not change .    finally , let us mention that one can also include spin in @xmath10 and thereby treat the hubbard model in the @xmath111 limit .",
    "then the operators @xmath112 , @xmath113 in @xmath35 acquire a spin label , too , and all single - particle levels become doubly degenerate .",
    "this makes the tails of the @xmath0-curves even flatter than in the spinless case .",
    "however , the curves are also pulled down by smaller normalization factors which leads to a faster initial decay . for a @xmath114 lattice ,",
    "the spectrum of the first @xmath115 states is , on the whole , rather close to that shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "we have studied the reduced density matrices for non - interacting fermions on a lattice . the key ingredient for",
    "the calculation was a simple representation of the ( ground ) state .",
    "this led rather directly to the exponential boltzmann - like form of the density matrices .",
    "the only really numerical step involved was the calculation of the single - fermion eigenvalues appearing in the exponent . with these , we discussed a number of cases in one and two dimensions with characteristic differences .",
    "we focused on the eigenvalues , but one can also investigate the single- fermion eigenfunctions .",
    "one then sees that they are concentrated near the interface between the two parts of the system .",
    "this explains the decisive role of the connectivity for the spectra .",
    "one should mention that fermionic density matrices have been studied before , e.g. in quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the systems are continuous and the hilbert space is infinite",
    ". then already the single - particle density matrices have inifinitely many eigenstates @xcite .",
    "our systems are discrete , but we are interested in density matrices for arbitrarily large subsystems",
    ". these are non - trivial even for non - interacting fermions . from the experience with other models",
    ", one can expect that the results are roughly representative also for more complicated systems .",
    "for this reason , the two - dimensional case is particularly important . with our formulae",
    ", we could treat the tight - binding model for arbitrary partitions of the system .",
    "this allows to make much more detailed statements than a previous , purely numerical investigation of this system @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can see the very slow decay of the spectra and of the truncation errors directly .",
    "basically , it is connected with the existence of long boundaries between the two parts of the system . in the current dmrg procedures , these appear necessarily at some point of the calculation .",
    "therefore it is not yet clear whether a recent new algorithm @xcite can really overcome this problem .",
    "we are indebted to h. grabert who drew our attention to fermionic coherent states .",
    "thanks c.t.chan for discussions and the deutscher akademischer austauschdienst ( daad ) for financial support .",
    "here we list some details concerning the steps in section ( [ sec : two ] )    \\(a ) to derive ( [ eqn : gsrelation ] ) , one writes the eqn .",
