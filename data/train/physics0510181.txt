    "an experiment at the @xmath4 future linear collider with 0.5 - 1  tev center - of - mass energy range must be capable to perform high precision measurements in order to exploit the physics potential of the machine .",
    "this fact sets strict requirements on performance of vertex , tracking and calorimetric detectors .",
    "the calice collaboration  @xcite has been formed to conduct the research and development effort needed to bring initial conceptual designs for the calorimetry to a final proposal suitable for an experiment at the future linear collider .",
    "the main proposal is that both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters should be highly granular to allow very efficient pattern recognition for excellent shower separation and particle identification within jets and subsequently to provide excellent jet reconstruction efficiency @xcite .",
    "this concept , also known as `` particle flow paradigm '' , to be successful requires optimal interplay between hardware , _",
    "i.e. _ granularity , and software , _ i.e. _ reconstruction algorithms .",
    "calice plans include studies of both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter prototypes .",
    "the electromagnetic prototype is a sampling calorimeter with w absorber and si pads as sensitive material .",
    "there are two main different hadronic prototype concepts under study both based on steel absorber .",
    "one has scintillator tiles and conventional analogue readout scheme , while the other is envisaged to be equipped with resistive plate chambers or gems and have digital readout @xcite .    combined and individual testbeam studies are planned that will allow us to debug technology / detector concept(s ) , to perform detector characterisation , to test the `` particle flow paradigm '' and the interplay between hardware and software , and also to test - validate - improve available simulation codes and shower packages @xcite .    the si / w ecal prototype and first testbeam results are discussed here .",
    "the si / w electromagnetic prototype is a sampling calorimeter with high granularity , in both transverse and longitudinal direction .",
    "the full detector is longitudinally segmented into 30 layers of w interleaved with 0.5  mm thick si pads as sensitive material .",
    "the w layers have varying thickness , the first 10 layers are 1.4  mm thick each , 2.8  mm in the next 10 and 4.2  mm in the final 10 . the total depth of the detector is about 24  @xmath2 at normal incidence , and has an active face with an area of 18  @xmath0  18  @xmath1 .",
    "it is read out in 1  @xmath0  1  @xmath1 cells and in total there are 9720 channels arranged in 270 wafers each consisting of a 6  @xmath0  6 cell matrix .",
    "a schematic of the full prototype is given in figure  [ fig : ecalproto ] which illustrates more clearly the actual construction .",
    "the layers are arranged in slabs with their supporting structure consisting of h - shaped w sheet wrapped with a carbon fiber layer . on each side of the w sheet of the slabs pcb s",
    "are put on which the si wafers are glued .",
    "then each slab is shielded with aluminum foil .",
    "this construction introduces odd / even layer asymmetry , which contributes to difference in layer response at a few percent level , since showering particles pass through alternately different material budget before its signal is sampled , namely w - al - si - pcb for the odd layers and w - pcb - si - al for the even layers .",
    "a structure of 10 layers with in total 60 wafers and 2160 channels was calibrated in a cosmic testbench at ecole polytechnique in paris , france .",
    "about @xmath5 cosmic triggers were recorded during december 2004 .",
    "these data allowed the calibration constants of these channels to be determined to 1% level of accuracy which is sufficient for the current phase of studies .",
    "a typical channel is shown in figure  [ fig : cosmicscalibration](a ) , the pedestal and the mip signal are clearly separated and have gaussian and landau shape , respectively , as expected . a signal over noise ratio of about 8.5 was observed with a variation among the channels of about 6% , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : cosmicscalibration](b ) . figure  [ fig : cosmicscalibration](c ) shows the distribution of the mip peak for the channels .",
    "one should note how narrow the distribution is , with a spread , as expressed by the sigma / mean , of 3% .",
    "this intercalibration spread is coming from the variation of the wafer thickness which is 3% as given by the wafer suppliers .",
    "construction and material inhomogeneity contribute to the constant term of energy resolution and is a common source of performance degradation . to be able to determine and",
    "to correct for these inhomogeneities effects due to production tolerance is one of the key advantages of si being used for calorimetric detectors .",
    "since si show relatively stable properties along time and with respect to temperature variation less frequent monitoring and calibration dedicated effort will be required for a si based calorimeter .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     similar studies are under way for general debugging and understanding of the system before the next testbeam phase .",
    "we discussed the calice si / w ecal prototype and some first results from a recent testbeam .",
    "a prototype with 14 layers and depth of 7.2  @xmath2 at normal incidence , having in total 3024 channels of 1  @xmath0  1  @xmath1 si pads , was tested at desy with @xmath3 beam .",
    "the testbeam progressed very smoothly and a lot of data were collected that will allow us to perform a thorough debugging of the system .",
    "analysis studies are in progress in order to understand the detector before the next round of testbeams .",
    "the next testbeam is planned for summer 2005 with the prototype structure equipped with more layers and channels ."
