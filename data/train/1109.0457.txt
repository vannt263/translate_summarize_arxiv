    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , namely , accreting massive black holes ( bhs ) residing at the center of some galaxies , often exhibit a phenomenon called  soft excess \" ( e.g. , arnaud et al . 1985 ,",
    "turner and pounds 1989 ) , which appears in their soft x - ray spectra as a steep flux upturn towards lower energies . for years",
    ", this structure has remained unaccounted , and a number of explanations have been proposed .",
    "the simplest way to interpret it is a direct black body emission from the accretion disk around the central black hole .",
    "however , this interpretation was not considered reasonable , since this would require an accretion disk with a temperature of @xmath4  k , which would be too high for bhs of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the solar mass ( gierlinsk and done 2004 ) .",
    "other interpretations of the soft excess phenomenon include ; flux leakage through a patchy absorber ( e.g. , weaver et al .",
    "1995 ) , continuum modification due to warm absorbers ( e.g. , schurch & done 2008 ; oneil et al . 2007 ) , and reflection from a photoionized accretion disk emitting relativistically blurred fe - l lines ( ross , fabian , and ballantyne 2002 ; crummy et al . 2006 ; zoghbi et al . 2009 ; nardini et al . 2010 ) . as often argued ( e.g ,",
    "sobolewska & done 2007 ) , these alternative models degenerate , and are difficult to observationally distinguish",
    ". we do not even know whether the soft excess is a homogeneous phenomenon , or a mixture of effects from different origins .",
    "one of the causes of the above degeneracy is the lack of sufficient understanding of the primary continuum emission from these agns . due mainly to limitations in broad - band sensitivity of the available data , x - ray continua in these agns",
    "have usually been approximated by a single power - law ( pl ) model , against which a soft excess is defined .",
    "however , recent suzaku observations of the leading black - hole binary ( bhb ) , cyg x-1 , have revealed that its continuum in the low / hard state is considerably more convex than a single pl shape , requiring at least two thermal comptonized components with different @xmath7 parameters .",
    "then , agn may also exhibit such  multi - zone comptonization \" ( mzc ) effects , because agns and bhbs are generally believed to exhibit common accretion phenomena .",
    "such intrinsic curvature in the x - ray continuum , if found in agns , is expected to significantly renew our understanding of their soft excess issue .    because of its genuine broad - band sensitivity , suzaku ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2007 ) obviously provides the best available mean to search agn spectra for the expected mzc effects .",
    "given these , we studied the archival suzaku data of the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 , and successfully detected a hard x - ray component that varies independently of the dominant pl continuum ( noda et al .",
    "this new component can be interpreted as a thermal compton emission with a relatively high optical depth .",
    "these recent achievements urge us to examine x - ray continua of other seyfert galaxies for further mzc effects : the soft excess phenomenon itself is an obvious candidate . at least in some cases , the soft excess could represent an intrinsic continuum curvature due to an mzc effect .",
    "actually , prior to the suzaku studies , marshall et al .",
    "( 2003 ) had already applied a similar view to a narrow - line seyfert i galaxy , and porquet et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to pg quasars .    to examine the soft excess phenomena for such an mzc interpretation",
    ", we selected the type i seyfert galaxy markarian 509 ( hereafter mrk 509 ) and observed it with suzaku for 2010 novermber 2123 .",
    "this object is suited to our purpose , because it is x - ray bright ( 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 ) , with a low galactic hydrogen column density of @xmath11 @xmath9 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "this agn has an estimated bh mass of @xmath12 ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , and a mass accretion rate of @xmath13 times the eddington rate as estimated from the optical ( 510 nm ) luminosity in peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) after applying a bolometric correction by a factor of 9 ( kaspi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we hence regard the object as in a state analogous to the low / hard state of bhbs .",
    "( although this accretion rate could be a little too high for this analogy to hold , state transitions of agns are much less understood than those of bhbs . ) to be as model independent as possible , we conducted combined time - domain and spectrum - domain analysis . as a result ,",
    "we have detected , over 0.53.0 kev of the spectrum , a stable soft x - ray excess component , and successfully interpreted it in terms of the mzc view .",
    "prior to the present observation , mrk 509 had been observed with suzaku on 4 occasions in 2006 ; namely , on april 25 , october 14 , november 15 , and november 21 , for a typical exposure of 25 ks each .",
    "the obtained data were already utilized by ponti et al .",
    "although these observations have relatively short exposures , and hence not suited to the study of intra - observation variations , they provide important insight into long - term spectral changes .",
    "we hence analyzed these archival data as well , and found that the soft excess component varied on longer time scales .",
    "( 80mm,80 mm ) figure1.eps    during the suzaku ao-5 cycle , we observed mrk 509 for and a net exposure of 102 ks .",

    "the source was placed at the xis nominal position .",
    "suzaku has four sets of x - ray telescopes ( serlemitsos et al .",
    "2007 ) , four x - ray ccd cameras called the xis ( x - ray imaging spectrometer : koyama et al . 2007 ) , and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd : takahashi et al . 2007 ; kokubun et al . 2007 ) . among the four xis sensors ,",
    "xis 0 , 2 , and 3 use front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds which have almost identical responses , while xis 1 employs a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",

    "the hxd covers a 1070 kev energy band with si pin photo - diodes ( hxd - pin ) , and a 50600 kev range with gso scintillation counters ( hxd - gso ) . in the present work",
    ", we utilized the xis and hxd - pin data , which were prepared via version 2.5 processing .",
    "the available net exposure is 102 ks for the xis , and 92 ks for the hxd .    on - source events of each ccd camera were extracted from a circular region of @xmath14 radius centered on the source .",
    "background events were taken from a surrounding annular region of the same camera with the inner and outer radii of @xmath15 and of @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the response matrices and ancillary response files were created by ` xisrmfgen ` and ` xissimarfgen ` ( ishisaki et al .",
    "2007 ) , respectively . in the present analysis ,",
    "the data of xis 0 and 3 were added and utilized as xis fi , while those of xis 1 or 2 were not .",
    "events of hxd - pin were processed in a similar way . since the hxd has no imaging capability , non x - ray background ( nxb ) in the data",
    "is estimated by analyzing a set of fake events which were created by a standard nxb model ( fukazawa et al .",
    "we analyzed the on - source events and the nxb events in the same manner , and subtracted the latter from the former .",
    "in addition , the on - source data includes the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ; bolt et al .",
    "1987 ) , so we need to estimate and subtract it as well .",
    "the cxb contribution was estimated using the hxd - pin response to diffuse sources , assuming the spectral cxb surface brightness model determined by heao 1 ( gruber et al .",
    "1999 ) : @xmath17 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 str @xmath10 kev@xmath10 , where @xmath18 is the photon energy .",
    "the estimated cxb count rate is 5% of the nxb signals .    in the same way as described above",
    ", we also processed the 2006 suzaku data of mrk 509 .",
    "the exposures obtained with the xis / hxd were 25/15 , 26/23 , 24/18 , and 33/29 ks , on april 25 , october 14 , november 15 , and november 27 , respectively .",
    "to look for time variations in different energies , light curves were extracted in three bands of the 2010 data ; 0.53.0 kev ( soft band ) , 3.010 kev ( middle band ) , and 18.045.0 kev ( hard band ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the derived three light curves with 10 ks binning .",
    "the count rates in the soft and middle bands thus varied by @xmath19% , in a good correlation .",
    "although the hxd - pin light curve ( hard band ) exhibits statistically significant variations with @xmath20/d.o.f.@xmath21 , we can not tell immediately whether its variation follows those of the other bands .",
    "( 120mm,120 mm ) figure2.eps    to study correlations among the three light curves , we utilize count - count plots ( ccps ) , in which abscissa is the count rate in the middle band , and ordinate is those in the soft or hard bands .",
    "as expected , the middle vs. soft ccp , shown in figure 2(a ) , reveals a strong correlation between these two bands .",
    "when abscissa and ordinate are represented by @xmath22 and @xmath7 , respectively , the data distribution in this ccp can be reproduced by a linear relation as , @xmath23 with @xmath24d.o.f.@xmath25 . here",
    ", a systematic error of 2% was added to each xis count , which comes from uncertainties in ccd contamination , varying because of the source motion on the detectors by attitude jittering .",
    "similarly , the middle vs. hard ccp , shown in figure 2(b ) , represents generally positive correlations , but the data scatter is too large for a linear fit .",
    "the scatter suggests the presence of a variable hard component independent of the dominant power - law , as reported in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( noda et al .",
    "this issue will be studied elsewhere .",
    "( 110mm,110 mm ) figure3.eps    the above fit to the middle vs. soft ccp shows a significant zero - point offset ( non - zero @xmath7-intercept ) . as already utilized by churazov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to extract a stable disk emission component in the soft state of cyg x-1 , this offset in figure 2(a ) suggests the presence of a stable emission in the soft band .",
    "then , to investigate detailed spectral dependence of this effect , we divided the 0.53.0 kev band into 6 finer energy bands , 0.50.8 kev , 0.81.0 kev , 1.01.2 kev , 1.21.4 kev , 1.42.0 kev , and 2.03.0 kev , and computed a ccp in each band against the 310 kev ( middle band ) count rate .",
    "the derived 6 ccps are presented in figure 3 . in every ccp ,",
    "the data distribute almost linearly with small scatter , so the correlation between each finer energy band and the fiducial 310 kev band is considered to be strong . as a result , every ccp can be reproduced by a linear relations as @xmath26 where @xmath22 is again the middle - band count rate , while @xmath7 is that in each softer band . in calculating the fit",

    "( 80mm,80 mm ) figure4.eps    since the values of @xmath31 in table 1 is all non - zero and positive , we divided them by corresponding band width , and plotted the results in figure 4 in purple superposed on the time - averaged xis 0 + 3 spectrum .",
    "thus , the 6-band ccp analysis suggests the presence of a non - varying , softer spectral component in energies below 3 kev . to examine",
    "if the purple data points in figure 4 are well defined , we carried out the same analysis , changing the fiducial energy range in figure 3 from 310 kev to 410 kev or 510 kev . as a result , the values of @xmath31 were confirmed to differ by no less than 5% among the three trials .",
    "therefore , the purple spectrum in figure 4 can be considered robust .      to examine properties of the `` stable soft component '' extracted in the previous subsection , we tried quantifying its spectrum ( purple in figure 4 ) using typical empirical models .",
    "when the absorption is fixed to @xmath46 @xmath9 ( the galactic line - of - sight column ) , it can be reproduced by a pl model with a photon index of @xmath47 ( @xmath48d.o.f.@xmath49 ) , or by an optically - thin thermal plasma emission model apec with a temperature of @xmath50 kev and an abundance fixed at 0.5 solar ( @xmath48d.o.f.@xmath51 ) , or a blackbody of temperature @xmath52 kev ( @xmath48d.o.f.@xmath53 ) .",
    "therefore , this component is too soft ( in terms of the pl modeling ) for any leak - through signals of the dominant @xmath54 pl . the blackbody temperature is too hot ( in terms of the black body modeling ) for emission from an optically - thick accretion disk , because a standard disk temperature can be calculated to be @xmath55 ev when the black hole mass is @xmath56 and the accretion rate is 0.1 times the eddington rate ( section 1 ) .",
    "the plasma emission model is not likely either , as we later find ( in subsection 4.1 ) , slow variations in this soft component .",
    "furthermore , the lack of particular spectral emission feature at 0.71.0 kev in figure 4 ( or similarly in figure 5 ) rules out the blurred fe - l emission in interpretation of this soft component .    as an alternative attempt , we adopted the mzc standpoint , and fitted the same soft excess spectrum ( purple in figure 4 ) by a thermal comptonization model , comptt in xspec .",
    "its seed photon temperature was fixed at 20 ev , while its coronal temperature and optical depth were left free . as a result",
    ", the soft spectrum was reproduced successfully ( @xmath57/d.o.f.@xmath58 ) , with a coronal temperature of @xmath59  kev , and an optical depth of @xmath60 . since these parameters are reasonable for a comptonizing corona around a bh ( cf .",
    "makishima et al . 2008 ) , the extracted soft component can be explained in an mzc viewpoint . in figure 4 , we superpose the best - fit comptt model in cyan .",
    "it is nearly identical to the best - fit pl model .",
    "( 140mm,140 mm ) figure5.eps    ( 90mm,90 mm ) figure6.eps    according to our ccp analysis conducted in subsection 3.1 , the 0.510 kev spectrum is likely to be decomposed into the stable soft component ( in figure 4 ) , and the variable one having a constant shape ( as evidenced by the tight linear correlations seen in figure 3 ) . however",
    ", this suggestion obviously needs reconfirmation through more standard analysis of wide - band spectra .",
    "below , we conduct such attempts , first in a model independent manner utilizing the time variations , and then through spectral model fits .",
    "the 0.510 kev variations by @xmath0% happened to be such that the intensity was intermediate in the first @xmath61 of the light curve ( figure 1 ) , followed by a low intensity period , and then the source brightened during the last 1/3 .",
    "therefore , we divided the entire observation into three periods , 060 ks , 60130 ks , and 130190 ks , and named them middle , low , and high phases , respectively .",
    "then , xis and hxd - pin spectra were extracted from the individual phases . the derived high - phase and low - phase spectra are shown in figure 5(a ) , in the form of ratios to a common power - law with a photon index of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the two spectra both exhibit a clear soft excess , as a flux increase towards the lower band relative to the @xmath62 pl .",
    "similarly , the hxd data in figure 5(a ) reveal a ",
    "hard - excess \" effect .",
    "a clear fe - k emission line is also seen .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows ratios of the high - phase to low - phase spectra .",
    "thus , the ratio decreases clearly to both ends of the suzaku band pass , of which the soft - band decrease is in agreement with the inference derived in section 3.1 .",
    "quantitatively , the high - to - low variation amplitude is @xmath63% at 310 kev , while it decreases to @xmath64% at energies below @xmath65 kev .",
    "this agrees with figure 3(a ) because its implication , i.e. , comparable constant ( y - intercept ) and variable signals , would halve the variation amplitude at @xmath66  kev compared to that in 310 kev .",
    "to quantify the spectral shape change from the low phase to high phase , we subtracted the latter spectrum from the former . as presented in figure 5(c ) , the derived difference spectrum is featureless and can be reproduced successfully , with @xmath67d.o.f.@xmath68 , by a @xmath69 pl model , modified with the galactic column density @xmath70  @xmath9 ( section 1 ) . unlike the other two panels in figure 5",
    ", this panel ( c ) is in the @xmath71 form , and a gradual bending below @xmath72  kev is due to the galactic - column absorption .",
    "this result , combined with figure 5(b ) , implies that the entire 0.545 kev variability can be attributed to intensity changes of this @xmath62 pl emission , and the soft and hard excess effects , seen in figure 5(a ) , are due to the presence therein of stable signals which disappeared in the process of subtraction .    according to canonical interpretations of agn spectra , the variable @xmath54 component found above",
    "can be identified naturally with the dominant pl - like continuum due presumably to comptonization , and the constant signals in the hard band its reflection by cold materials in the accretion disk .",
    "then , the non - varying signals in the softer band , which causes the ratio decrease towards soft energies in figure 5(b ) , can be naturally identified with the stable soft component revealed in subsections 3.1 and 3.2 .",
    "we further speculate that this spectral component is responsible for the soft excess seen in figure 5(a ) .    in order to examine",
    "whether the spectroscopic soft excess seen in figure 5(a ) can really be identified with the stable soft component in figure 4 found through the timing analysis , we simultaneously fitted the high- and low - phase spectra with a model of ` wabs * ( cutoffpl + pexrav + zgauss + comptt ) ` . here , comptt is meant to reproduce the soft excess , in terms a successful modeling of the purple spectrum in figure 4",
    ". in the fitting , only normalizations of ` cutoffpl ` and ` zgauss ` were left free and independent between the two phases , while the other parameters were set the same between them . the interstellar absorption , ` wabs ` , was again fixed at @xmath46 @xmath9 .",
    "we also fitted simultaneously the stable soft spectrum , by the ` comptt ` term consisting the overall model , with its parameters tied to those in the simultaneous fit between the high- and low - phase spectra .",
    "both @xmath73 and @xmath74 of ` comptt ` were left free ( and common among the 3 spectra ) , while the seed disk temperature was again fixed at 20 ev .",
    "however , the fit was not acceptable ( @xmath57/d.o.f.@xmath75 ) , mainly because of large negative residuals in @xmath76  kev , which are considered to be caused by ionized absorbers .",
    "then , we included an ionized absorber model , ` warmabs ` , and repeated the fitting with an improved model , ` wabs * ( cutoffpl + pexrav + zgauss + warmabs * comptt ) ` .",
    "as a result of this model improvement , the three sets of suzaku spectra acruired in 2010 have been reproduced successfully ( @xmath20/d.o.f.@xmath77 ) .",
    "the result of this fitting is shown in figure 6 and table 1 .",
    "the photon index of the pl component , @xmath78 , is consistent , within 90% errors , with that obtained in the fit to the difference spectrum .",

    "( 2009 ) using the suzaku data obtained in 2006 .",
    "most importantly , the soft excess in the two broad - band spectra , and the soft component constructed from the ccp analysis , have been explained simultaneously by a thermal comptonization component with a coronal temperature of @xmath81  kev , an optical depth of @xmath82 , and a @xmath7-parameter of @xmath83 .",

    "an important fact is that the warmabs * comptt components , found with these 2006 data sets , are very similar in shape and intensity to that found in the 2010 data ( table 2 ) , even though the ccp - derived soft component ( figure 4 ) was not incorporated in fitting the 2006 data sets . like in the 2010 data ( table 2 ) , the fe - k line was mostly narrow and centered at 6.4 kev ( i.e. , neutral fluorescence ) , except on 2006 november 27 when it was slightly ionized and broadened . within the rather large errors , the fe - k line equivalent width is consistent with being constant over the 5 data sets .",

    "in the present work , we analyzed the five suzaku datasets of mrk 509 in four steps .",
    "the first step was a kind of  dynamic \" analysis ( subsections 3.1 , 3.2 and part of subsection 3.3 ) , in which we applied the techniques of ccp ( figure 2 , figure 3 ) , and intensity - sorted spectroscopy ( figure 5b , figure 5c ) to the 2010 data , utilizing the @xmath110 continuum variation .",
    "then , the presence of a stable soft spectral component ( figure 4 ) and a variable @xmath158 pl component ( figure 5d ) was derived .",
    "the second step was a more ordinary  static \" one ( subsection 3.3 ) , wherein a clear soft excess was noticed in the 2010 spectra ( figure 5a ) above the pl continuum . combining these steps , we showed in the third step ( subsection 3.3 , figure 6 ) that the stable soft component derived in the 1st step can be identified with the soft excess found in the 2nd step . finally , in the 4th step , the analysis of the additional four suzaku data sets acquired in 2006 revealed that the stable soft component was in fact variable on longer time scales of weeks to months , without particular correlation to the intensity of the pl continuum .    through the above analysis procedures , the overall spectral and timing behavior of all the five suzaku data sets have been explained in a consistent way , by a linear combination of the following three spectral components :    * the ordinary @xmath158 pl , accompanied by a moderate cold reflection with a reflection fraction of @xmath159 .",
    "the pl intensity varied on a time scale of @xmath160 day keeping a nearly constant slope , while it was not much more variable on the longer time scales . * the soft component with a relatively constant shape , which is responsible for the soft excess .",
    "its intensity varied by a factor of @xmath72 on longer time scales , but did not change during the 2010 pointing .",
    "* the fe - k line , which is almost constant and narrow ( except on 2006 november 27 ) , produced via fluorescence by near neutral matter .",
    "the soft component in the above scenario has been reproduced successful by several alternative models , including a steep pl with @xmath161 , a blackbody of temperature 0.16 kev , and a thermal comptonizaion model based on the mzc viewpoint .",
    "this mzc interpretation is considered reasonable , because such a scenario has already been established in cyg x-1 ( e.g. , makishima et al . 2008 ) , and the derived value of @xmath162 is typical of thermal comptonization processes .",
    "in addition , the more gradual evolution of the soft component than the pl component agrees with the mzc properties observed with suzaku from cyg x-1 ( yamada et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "is it possible to interpret the soft component of mrk 509 in alternative ways , without invoking the mzc view ?",
    "as described in section 1 , major explanations so far proposed for the soft excess phenomenon in type i seyfert galaxies include ; ( i ) the hardest end of the accretion disk emission , ( ii ) flux leakage through a clumpy absorber , ( iii ) thermal emission from some hot plasmas , ( iv ) continuum modification due to ionized absorbers , and ( v ) disk reflection dominated by relativistically blurred fe - l lines .",
    "as already mentioned in subsection 3.2 , ( i ) can be excluded , because the equivalent blackbody temperature of the soft excess , 0.16 kev , is much higher than 20 ev , which is expected when a bh of @xmath163 is accreting at 10% of the eddington limit .",
    "we can also rule out ( ii ) , because the equivalent pl slope , @xmath164 , is too steep for any leakage of the @xmath62 pl .",
    "similarly , ( iii ) has been rejected by the long - term changes in the soft excess intensity ( section 4 ) .",
    "below , we therefore examine whether ( iv ) or ( v ) can explain the soft excess observed from mrk 509 .",
    "the interpretation ( iv ) assumes a scenario wherein absorption by some ionized absorber suppresses the continuum , in intermediate energy ranges which is above the involved inner - shell edge energies , while the effect diminishes toward softer energies because outer - shell electrons are absent due to ionization ( e.g. , schurch & done 2008 ; oneil et al .",
    "this could produce a sort of soft excess as seen in figure 5(a ) .",
    "in fact , we had to introduce the warmabs factor in our fitting to account for some soft x - ray structures . however , the difference spectrum shown in figure 5(c ) bears little evidence of such local soft x - ray features ; this is difficult to explain under the ionized absorber scenario , unless some extreme fine tuning is operating to control the absorber s column density and ionization degree in response to the continuum changes .",
    "furthermore , the simplest case , i.e. , no variations in the absorber , would predict @xmath165 in equation ( 1 ) and equation ( 2 ) . to explain the good linearity of these relations with positive values of @xmath31",
    ", we would need another ( probably independent ) fine tuning between the continuum and the absorber . from these considerations , we conclude that the observed soft excess of mrk 509 can not be explained in terms of ionized absorber .",
    "finally , there remains the explanation ( v ) , which attributes the soft excess to relativistically broadened fe - l features ( e.g. , zoghbi et al . 2009 ; nardini et al .",
    "however , this can not be applied to the present observation , either , for the following reasons .",
    "first of all , the relatively narrow fe - k line , and the moderate strength of disk reflection ( @xmath166 ) , argues against the presence of strong relativistic effects .",
    "next , on a time scale of @xmath167 ks in the 2010 observation , the reflection hump intensity ( not the fraction ) remained constant , as evidenced by the high - energy drop of the ratio in figure 5(b ) , and the lack of such a hump in figure 5(c ) .",
    "unless some fine tuning like the  light bending \" mechanism ( miniutti et al .",
    "2007 ) is working , this suggests that the reflection and the fluorescence lines are produced at a distance @xmath168 from the central bh , where @xmath169 is the gravitational radius and corresponds to @xmath160 ks for a bh of @xmath170 .",
    "lastly , as revealed by figure 7 and figure 8 , the soft excess in mrk 509 is an effect that spreads over a considerably wider energy range than is covered by the fe - l line / edge features .    as discussed for far ,",
    "none of the existing explanations , ( i)(v ) , succeed in consistently explaining the properties of the soft excess observed from mrk 509 .",
    "we hence conclude that our mzc interpretation provide the most reasonable explanation to the present observation .      through the present study ,",
    "it has become likely that the soft excess component seen in mrk 509 is produced by a comptonization process that has a @xmath7-parameter of @xmath162 .",
    "this result is consistent with an independent multi - wavelength study on mrk 509 from the optical to the soft x - ray band ( mehdipour et al .",
    "2011 ) , which also shows the existence of a thermal comptonized component from @xmath171 ev to @xmath64 kev .",
    "therefore , the comptonizing corona in this seyfert galaxy is inferred to be inhomogeneous , namely in a mzc condition , and is characterized by multiple values of @xmath7-parameter .",
    "developed to explain cyg x-1 ( makishima et al .",
    "2008 , yamada et al .",
    "2011 ) and narrow - line seyfert galaxies ( marshall et al .",
    "2003 ) , this mzc view has thus been applied to a type i seyfert , successfully . in particular , the soft excess component of mrk 509 , revealed in figure 8 , is very similar to the  soft compton \" component found in cyg x-1 ( makishima et al .",
    "since the central engine should not differ significantly among seyfert galaxies , we expect this view to be applicable to many other syeferts as well .",
    "the scenario developed here thus decomposed the 0.545 kev continuum ( excluding the hard bump and the fe - k line ) into the two comptonization component ( subsection 5.1 ) , the dominant pl and the soft excess , considered to have a larger and a smaller values of @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "it is , however , more natural to consider that the comptonizing corona in a seyfert galaxy ( and of a bhb as well ) has its @xmath7 distributed continuously over a certain range , which is represented in the present case by the two discrete values . actually , in some other objects , we may find an extra spectral component representing higher end of the @xmath7 distribution .",
    "possible examples include the  independent hard x - ray compoent \" found in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( noda et al .",
    "the present figure 2(b ) is suggestive of a similar effect taking place in mrk 509 .",
    "in addition to these arguments , yamada et al .",
    "( 2009 ) invoked correlated height vs. @xmath74 ( or @xmath7 ) variations in a comptonizing corona , to explain a suzaku detection of interesting spectral changes in the obscured low - luminosity agn , ngc 4258 .",
    "the present work is thought to have twofold implications .",
    "on one hand , it provides a novel interpretation of the long - standing puzzle of soft excess , based on a physical analogy to bhbs , and in terms of essential properties of the agn central engine rather than invoking secondary processes ( e.g. , absorption , reflection , or fluorescence ) . on the other hand",
    ", it shows that the agn continua can actually deviate significantly from a single pl , like those in bhbs .",
    "therefore , we need an extreme caution when trying to model spectral features ( e.g. , broad fe - k lines ) that couple strongly with the continuum ."
