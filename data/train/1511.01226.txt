    "specifically , plurirectangle here means a connected union of rectangles in @xmath7-dimensions with edges parallel to the axes .",
    "the above equation is important for various reasons @xcite .",
    "as well as describing many significant physical processes like the transport and diffusion of pollutants , representing the temperature of a fluid moving along a heated wall , or the concentration of electrons in models of semiconductor devices , it is also a fundamental subproblem for models of incompressible flow .",
    "the unsteady elliptic problem can be handled in two different ways such as `` rothe method '' and `` method of lines '' .",
    "for the `` rothe method '' , the time variable is discretized firstly by certain time differencing scheme to obtain a sequence of steady problems , and each of these problems is then solved by some spatial discretization method . for the `` method of lines '' ,",
    "the spatial variable is discretized firstly to obtain a system of ordinary - differential equations ( odes ) or differential - algebraic equations ( daes ) , and certain time differencing scheme is then applied to solve the above differential equations .    the waveform relaxation ( wr ) methods are powerful solvers for numerically computing the solution of odes or daes on sequential and parallel computers , which was first introduced by lelarasmee in @xcite for simulating the behavior of very large - scale electrical networks .",
    "later , there are lots of expansions and applications of his theory ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this class of iteration methods is to apply relaxation technique directly to the corresponding differential equations , which can be regarded as a natural extension of the classical relaxation methods for solving systems of linear equations with iterating space changing from @xmath8 to the time - dependent function or the waveform space .    in order to take advantage of the waveform relaxation methods for solving the unsteady elliptic problem ( [ uns - elliptic ] ) , we follow the first step of `` method of lines '' to discretize ( [ uns - elliptic ] ) spatially with spatial grid parameter @xmath9 to obtain the so - called unsteady discrete elliptic problem as follows , @xmath10 with @xmath11 being hermitian and @xmath12 being non - hermitian positive definite , the solution @xmath13 and the data @xmath14 are complex vector - valued functions .",
    "it can be proved that the linear differential operator @xmath15 is non - self - adjoint positive definite on lebesgue square - integrable function space under suitable conditions .",

    "similar to the hs splitting of matrix , we define the hs splitting of the non - self - adjoint positive definite linear differential operator @xmath15 , and design the waveform relaxation method based on the hs spitting of operator @xmath15 , i.e. , the wr - hss method , for solving the unsteady discrete elliptic problem ( [ nsa - pd - lde ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "it is started in section [ sec - hss ] by reviewing the basic idea of the wr method and the hss method , then the framework of the wr - hss method is described specifically . in section [ sec - wrhss - convergence ] , the convergence analysis of the wr - hss method is given .",
