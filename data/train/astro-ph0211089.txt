    "broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars show absorption from gas with blueshifted outflow velocities of typically 0.1@xmath3 . about 10% of quasars exhibit bal troughs ,",
    "usually attributed either to an orientation effect such that all quasars have bal outflows covering @xmath410% of the sky , or a phase of @xmath4100% covering lasting @xmath410% of the typical quasar lifetime .",
    "understanding bal outflows is necessary since the bal outflow mass loss rates seem comparable to the accretion rates required to power quasars .",
    "unusual bal quasars delineate the full range of physical conditions and parameter space spanned by bal outflows .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al . 2000 ; www.sdss.org ) has discovered populations of unusual low - ionization broad absorption line quasars ( ` lobals ' ) , many of them ` felobals ' with absorption from excited feii or feiii ( hall et al . 2002 ) .    one population of unusual bal quasars has unprecedented line ratios which are the reverse of those seen in previously known objects ; namely , lobals with stronger absorption in aliii than mgii and felobals with weak or no feii absorption but with feiii even stronger than mgii ( fig .",
    ". the cloudy modeling of de kool et al .",
    "2002 ( his figs . 6 - 7 ) shows that these ratios can be produced in a high density outflow ( log @xmath5@xmath610.5 @xmath1 for ionization parameter @xmath7 ) with column density @xmath8 in a narrow range ( @xmath40.2 dex ) such that a partially ionized zone of feii and mgii  typically present in agn broad emission line regions  does not exist in the bal outflow along our line of sight , but a feiii+aliii zone does .",
    "the high densities and narrow range in @xmath8 required to reproduce the observed line ratios explains why these objects are so rare .",
    "the sdss has recently found a quasar with a narrow feiii - dominant absorption system for which high - resolution spectra could test this explanation .",
    "unfortunately , the most luminous feiii - dominant bal quasar known , sdss 2215 - 0045 , can not test this model since a vlt+uves spectrum shows no narrow features .",
    "however , the uves spectrum does reveal that civ and siiv emission are as weak as aliii .",
    "this might be due in part to a weak absorption trough at @xmath44000kms@xmath2 in addition to the main trough at @xmath415000kms@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1b , blue arrows ) .",
    "the feiii uv48 @xmath92080  absorption in sdss 2215 - 0045 appears stronger than the uv34 @xmath91910  absorption , which is unphysical . in hall",
    "2002 this was attributed to a previously unknown resonance populating the lower term of uv48 , but we now believe it is due to a complicated underlying continuum . as seen in fig . 1a ,",
    "the unabsorbed continuum of 2215 - 0045 ( thin dotted red line ) can be estimated as a power law plus feii+feiii emission ( using the extreme fe emitter sdss 0923 + 5745 as a template ) , all reddened by @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12-@xmath13@xmath14=0.06 .",
    "due to the strong emission at 1800  and the lack of emission at 2000 , the observed spectrum ( heavy line ) appears consistent with saturated feiii uv48 and uv34 absorption with 35% partial covering .",
    "the lower - ionization mgii absorption has smaller partial covering , which is typical .",
    "the fe - emission template is not a perfect fit ( e.g. , 2215 - 0045 has weaker mgii and ciii ] emission than the template ) , but it shows the spectrum can be fit without invoking a new feiii resonance .",
    "traditionally , objects with troughs @xmath152000 km / s wide , or with absorption solely within 3000 km / s of the quasar redshift , have not been classified as bal quasars .",
    "however , numerous studies have shown that both ` mini - bals ' and many narrow associated systems also arise in the central regions of agn . thus in hall",
    "( 2002 ) we suggested an alternative to the traditional balnicity index which does not discriminate against narrow intrinsic absorbers .",
    "the physics of agn outflows are more easily studied with such objects , since in bals most doublet transitions are blended and can not be used to infer the physical conditions or other  parameters  of  the  outflow .  for  example ,  studies  of  numerous  intrinsic  agn outflows  have  shown  that  the  troughs  are  usually  saturated .  in  such  cases ,  the trough depth in high - resolution spectra yields that ion s covering factor as a function of velocity . then , knowing the relative strengths of the various transitions observed , interesting conclusions can be drawn by examining the spectra .",
    "an excellent example is the reddened , extreme - feii - emitting , mini - lobal quasar sdss 1453 + 0029 , which has @xmath16=1.2899@xmath170.0008 from an isaac near - ir spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) . broadly speaking",
    ", this object has  two hei absorption systems within a more extensive ( in velocity space ) set of mgii absorption systems .",
    "this hei absorption arises in an excited state populated by recombination ( heii + e@xmath18 @xmath19 hei + @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus this hei absorption traces the column density of heii , which yields a lower limit on @xmath8 since hydrogen is completely ionized in heii regions .",
    "component a in sdss 1453 + 0029 appears to have equally strong hei@xmath93188 and hei@xmath93889 absorption ( fig .",
    "since the latter transition is intrinsically much stronger , this means that hei@xmath93889 is saturated .",
    "the covering factor of the hei ( @xmath450% ) is less than that of mgii ( @xmath485% ) by inspection .",
    "component b has hei line ratios consistent with hei@xmath93889 being at most only slightly saturated , but its velocity - dependent covering factor reaches a maximum @xmath490% while that of mgii is only @xmath460% .",
    "thus , hei and mgii absorption can behave very differently , even over small velocity ranges , and even when the two components are very likely in physical proximity as indicated by their nearly identical velocities .    based on data from eso programs 267.a-5698 and 67.a-580 . funding for the sdss archive has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , nasa , the nsf , the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the japanese monbukagakusho , and the max planck society .",
    "the sdss is managed by the astrophysical research consortium , for the participating institutions : the university of chicago , fermilab , the institute for advanced study , the japan participation group , the johns hopkins university , los alamos national laboratory , the max - planck - institute for astronomy , the max - planck - institute for astrophysics , new mexico state university , university of pittsburg , princeton university , the usno and the university of washington ."
