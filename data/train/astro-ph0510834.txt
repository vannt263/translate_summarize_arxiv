    "the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) have been measured in more than twenty neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( ns lmxbs ) in their persistent emission with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , which offered unique insights into the physics of strong gravity and dense matter ( see van der klis 2000 , 2005 for reviews ) . in many cases",
    "the twin khz qpos appear simultaneously and the correlations between the pair frequencies have been investigated extensively ( e.g. , psaltis et al . 1998 , 1999b ;",
    "belloni et al . 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , their frequencies also follow rather tight correlations with other timing features of the x - ray emission ( ford & van der klis 1998 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1999a ; belloni et al . 2002 ) .",
    "there is currently no consensus as to the origin of these qpos , nor on what physical parameters determine their frequencies , which have been identified with various characteristic frequencies in the inner accretion flow ( see e.g. stella & vietri 1999 ; osherovich & titarchuk 1999 ; lamb & miller 2001 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "2003 ) .    with the discovery of the twin khz qpos in the accretion - powered millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4@xmath03658",
    ", it was found that the frequency separation @xmath1 is almost half the spin frequency ( wijnands et al .",
    "2003 ) . for other sources with detected spin frequencies @xmath2 from the burst oscillations , @xmath1 are shown to be close to either the spin frequencies or half of them ( van der klis 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "these findings seem to hint some underlying mechanisms relating @xmath2 to the upper and lower khz qpo frequencies ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , the more detailed measurements show that @xmath1 is generally inconsistent with a constant value of @xmath2 , but varying with @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( van der klis 2000 , 2005 and references therein ) , which cast doubts about the validity of the simple beat - frequency interpretation ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ; see lamb & miller 2001 for a modified version ) .",
    "osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) suggested the lower khz qpo frequency @xmath4 to be the keplerian frequency in the disk and the higher khz qpo frequency @xmath3 the hybrid between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "kluniak et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that the twin khz qpos can be explained by a nonlinear resonance in the epicyclic motion in the accretion disks , which can lead to the 3:2 ratio for the two main resonances ( see also abramowicz & kluniak 2001 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative interpretation for the origin of the twin khz qpos , by considering the interaction between the neutron star magnetic field and the surrounding accretion disk .",
    "we introduce the model in  2 , and present its applications to several ns lmxbs with the simultaneously detected khz qpos and known spin frequencies in  3 .",
    "the possible physical implications and conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "neutron stars in lmxbs generally accretes via an accretion disk . for most part of the disk ,",
    "the plasma rotates in a keplerian orbit .",
    "close to the ns surface , the stellar magnetic fields begin to truncate the disk and control the motion of the plasma , resulting in a non - keplerian boundary layer lying between the magnetosphere corotating with the star and the outer keplerian disk .",
    "we assume that the boundary layer is confined by the inner and outer radii , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . as conceivable , the plasma corotates with the magnetosphere at @xmath6 , and",
    "the plasma s motion begins to deviate from keplerian rotation and take its maximum value at @xmath7 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "as for the construction of the model , _ we identify the upper khz qpo frequency @xmath3 to be the rotational frequency at @xmath7 _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the keplerian rotation frequency at @xmath7 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 depends on the rotational frequency distribution inside the boundary layer .",
    "unfortunately , there is no analytic solution to the structure of the boundary layer , and the value of @xmath11 can be evaluated only through numerical calculations .",
    "however , based on the qualitative characteristics of the rotation rate in the boundary layer , campbell ( 1987 ) has suggested the following form for the disk rotation profile close to the magnetosphere @xmath12 , \\label{nur}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 . when @xmath14 , @xmath15 ; when @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( 2 ) gives a reasonable description of @xmath18 close to @xmath6 , but our interest here focuses on the rotational behavior around @xmath7 , at which eq .",
    "( 2 ) fails to be valid for a sufficiently wide range of @xmath19 .",
    "instead , we take a slightly modified version of eq .  ( 2 ) to account for disk rotation , @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{nur2}\\ ] ] as an illustration , fig .",
    "1 shows @xmath21 against @xmath22 for three selected values of @xmath23 , 0.5 and 0.8 in solid curves .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to keplerian rotation for comparison .",
    "although the hypothesized form ( 3 ) is phenomenological , it shares the main features with the numerically calculated results ( e.g. , ghosh & lamb 1979 ) , and the following analysis also indicates that its adequate for the disk rotation . from eq .",
    "( 3 ) we can determine the location of @xmath7 using the condition @xmath24 at @xmath7 , and obtain the values of @xmath25 for different values of the so - called fastness parameter @xmath26 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath11 as a function of @xmath27 . before discussing the origin of the lower khz qpos",
    ", we note that in solar physics the qpos of several minute periods in coronal loops have been detected and successfully interpreted as the standing kink modes of mhd waves ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1999 ; nakariakov et al .",
    "thus , following the similar ideas in treating the qpos in the coronal loops , we suppose that these mhd waves could also be excited at the inner edge of the accretion disks , where the poloidal field lines are dragged along the azimuthal direction due to shear motion between the star and the disk , and various types of mhd instabilities take place ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) .",
    "the reconnection of the azimuthal magnetic field lines could result in circular flux tubes ( loops ) in the boundary layer , where plasma is confined along a magnetic field line with some cross section .",
    "it is well known that the coronal loops may be set into oscillations with various modes leading to brightness oscillations ( roberts 2000 for a review ) . while the similar oscillations may also occur in the accretion disks , generated by mhd turbulence , here we focus on the fast kink mode of standing mhd waves .",
    "these fast waves arise as a free mode only for high density loops ( edwin & roberts 1982 ) , which may be appropriate in accretion disks in ns lmxbs .",
    "assume the loop length being the circumference of the magnetosphere , @xmath28 , the oscillation frequency is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the kink speed .",
    "the wave number @xmath31 .",
    "the integer @xmath32 stands for the node number of the vibration along the tube axis , with @xmath33 being the principal mode . at the inner edge of the accretion disk ,",
    "the sound speeds are much smaller than the azimuthal alfvn speeds @xmath34 , and the plasma inside a loop is much denser than its surroundings for the comparable magnetic field strengths , therefore we have the kink speed @xmath35 ( roberts 2000 ) , and in turn the frequency of a standing kink mode @xmath36    in the following , we estimate the azimuthal field strength at @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the stellar magnetic field lines are initially dipolar and penetrate the accretion disk .",
    "the differential rotation between the star and the disk generates the azimuthal field component @xmath37 from the vertical component @xmath38 ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) . according to wang ( 1995 ) , if the growth of @xmath37 is limited by the diffusive decay produced by the turbulent mixing within the disk , @xmath37 is given by ( wang 1995 ) . ]",
    "@xmath39 where the parameter @xmath40 ( aly 1984 ; uzdensky , k@xmath41nigl , & litwin 2002 ) .",
    "we assume that the magnitude of @xmath7 is close to that of the alfven radius where the magnetic energy density equals the total kinetic energy density ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ) , i.e. , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass density , and @xmath44 . combining eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) we get the azimuthal alfven speed at @xmath7 , @xmath45    furthermore , _ we suggest the lower khz qpos to be the principal fast kink mode of the standing mhd waves along the @xmath37 field lines at @xmath7_. inserting eq .",
    "( 8) into eq .",
    "( 5 ) we find the frequency to be @xmath46 combining eqs .  ( 1 ) and ( 9 ) we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 is taken as a free parameter that absorbs the uncertainties in determining @xmath7 and @xmath49 . since the @xmath50 relation is known from fig .",
    "2 , eq .  ( 10 ) suggests a unique relation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 for given values of @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , the mhd oscillations represent the continuum , i.e. , the oscillation frequency is a continuous function of a wave number .",
    "we ascribe the lower khz qpos to be the principal fast kink mode with the loop length of @xmath51 due to the following facts .",
    "firstly , the global modes with @xmath33 or 2 are easiest to excite in the loops ( roberts , edwin , & benz 1984 ) . secondly , for a standing wave the decay time of the mhd oscillations",
    "is @xmath52 ( roberts 2000 ) . apparently , the oscillations with the longer @xmath53 and smaller @xmath54 last the longer lifetime , and hence are more easily to be detected .",
    "thus , for the fast kink mode at @xmath7 , oscillations along @xmath37 have the maximum loop length and smallest wave number when @xmath51 and @xmath33 .",
    "there may exist the other oscillation modes ( e.g. the fast sausage mode of standing fast mhd waves , standing slow mhd waves , and propagating mhd waves ) in the accretion disks , and some of them could be also shown as some kinds of qpos . however , their oscillation frequencies are either too high or too low compared to those of the khz qpos in ns lmxbs .",
    "additionally it seems that the kink mode is most likely to be seen as a standing wave ( roberts 2000 ) .",
    "we have compared the predicted @xmath55 relation with the observations of khz qpos in four ns lmxbs ( 4u1608@xmath052 , 4u1636@xmath053 , 4u1728@xmath034 , and 4u1915@xmath005 ) , in which both the spin and twin khz qpo frequencies have been measured ( data were provided by t. belloni , m. mndez and d. psaltis ) . in fig .",
    "3 the crosses represent the measurements and the solid lines stand for the theoretical relations .",
    "the spin frequency and the adopted value of @xmath56 for each source are also displayed . in all cases",
    "the value of @xmath56 is of order of unity as expected .",
    "the theoretical predictions and the measured khz qpo data match quite well for 4u 1728@xmath034 and 4u 1915@xmath005 , albeit the approximated consistence is obtained for 4u 1608@xmath052 and 4u 1636@xmath053 , which may be caused by the fact that the real magnetic field structure in these sources may be more complicated than in the simplified model considered here .",
    "in this paper we have presented a plausible mechanism for the production of twin khz qpos in ns lmxbs , invoking the magnetic field - accretion disk interaction .",
    "although nss in lmxbs are thought to have weak magnetic fields ( @xmath57 g ) , their influence on the disk rotation has not been paid much attention in the existed works on this subject .",
    "titarchuk , lapdius , & muslimov ( 1998 ) has already suggested that a shock occurs in the transition layer where the keplerian disk adjust to sub - keplerian flow .",
    "the disk can undergo various types of oscillations under the influence of the gas , radiation , magnetic pressure and gravitational force .",
    "as to the origin of the oscillations , the boundary layer in our work is similar to but closer to the ns compared with the centrifugal barrier region in titarchuk et al .",
    "one of the twin khz qpo frequencies is usually interpreted as the keplerian rotation frequency at some preferred radii , most likely the inner edge of the disk ( e.g. , miller at al .",
    "1998 ; titarchuk & osherovich 1999 ) .",
    "we have followed this idea , but suggested that the real ( non - keplerian ) rotation at @xmath7 leads to the upper khz qpos .",
    "unfortunately , since there is no general analytic form for the rotational profile within the boundary layer , we have to use a phenomenological description for the rotation of disk plasma around the inner edge , that is , keplerian rotation at @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( 10 ) still fits the observational data fairly well . ] .",
    "although it seems to be adequate , its validity and accuracy should be testified more carefully in the future by both observational and theoretical investigations .",
    "moreover , we interpret the lower khz qpos to be the fast kink modes of mhd oscillations in loops along the @xmath37 field lines at @xmath7 , shared with the similar physical mechanism for coronal loop oscillations . since @xmath37 is generated by @xmath38 through shear motion between the ns and the disk , this naturally links the twin khz qpos with the stellar spin .",
    "but it is distinct from the traditional beat - frequency model by the fact that in our work the twin opos originate from different physical processes .",
    "we note that similar hypothesis was discussed by muslimov ( 1995 ) , who suggested that the qpos in lmxbs may be caused by the excitation of the so - called nonlinear global alfvn modes in the boundary layer plasma .",
    "it is interesting that these modes were observed in the studies of an ideal mhd spectrum of a toroidal plasma ( goedbloed 1975 ) .",
    "in addition , the detailed numerical investigation of these modes was performed by appert et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , and their existence was confirmed experimentally by behn et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and evans et al .",
    "( 1984 ) .",
    "recent analysis by barret , olive , & miller ( 2005 ) showed that the quality factor for the lower khz qpos in 4u 1636@xmath053 increases with frequency up to a factor of @xmath58 when @xmath59 hz , then drops at higher frequencies .",
    "a ceiling of the lower khz qpo frequency at 920 hz is also seen . in the frame of the present work ,",
    "we ascribe these features to the evolution of the twisted field lines .",
    "several theoretical studies of the star - disk interaction ( e.g. aly 1984 , 1985 ; uzdensky et al .",
    "2002 ) have shown that as a dipole field is twisted due to differential rotation , the field lines inflate and effectively open up when a critical twist angle is attained ( uzdensky et al .",
    "this limits the azimuthal pitch at @xmath7 , @xmath60 , to some critical value , say , @xmath61 , demonstrating that a steady state of configuration could be established only if the rotation shear @xmath62 is small enough .",
    "these arguments suggest that there may exist a maximum value of @xmath3 , beyond which the @xmath37 field becomes unstable , resulting in decreasing quality factor of the lower khz qpos at higher frequencies and a saturation frequency of @xmath4 when most of the field lines become open .",
    "we have presented a qualitative description of the khz qpo production mechanism and a crude quantitative expression of the khz qpo frequencies , to interpret the observed khz qpo phenomena . as a preliminary exploration ,",
    "many physical details have not been considered , such as in what condition and how much mhd wave energy is produced to account for the observed fourier power spectrum of khz qpos .",
    "these should be investigated more carefully in the future work .",
    "this work was supported by nsfc under grant number 10025314 and mstc under grant number nkbrsf g19990754 .",
    "we are grateful for t. belloni , m. mndez and d. psaltis for providing the qpo data , and t. p. li and p. f. chen for helpful discussions .",
