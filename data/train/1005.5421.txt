    "the standard assumption is that the idm interpretation of dama s signal can be confirmed or refuted by any experiment with a target nucleus heavy enough to cause the inelastic transition @xcite . for dama",
    ", the inelastic transition occurs through scattering off the @xmath31 nucleus in the nai(tl ) target .",
    "naively , any experiment with a target mass greater than @xmath31 could provide a sufficient test .",
    "two upcoming experiments fall into this category : xenon100 @xcite and cresst @xcite , which use @xmath32 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "xenon100 has currently released results from a calibration run of 11.2 live days during oct - nov 2009 .",
    "they report 161 kg - d effective exposure and have observed no events in their acceptance region between 4.5 - 40 kevnr .",
    "cresst , which consists of nine detectors of cawo@xmath33 and one detector of znwo@xmath33 , has shown preliminary results in the energy window from 10 - 40 kevnr obtained from summer 2009 until the present ; however , the exposure was not reported @xcite .",
    "cresst provides a unique experimental environment for testing idm because it has the heaviest target nucleus of all current direct detection experiments .",
    "@xmath20 is expected to be highly sensitive to inelastic scattering because its velocity threshold is a factor @xmath34 lower than iodine . as a result",
    ", a larger fraction of the halo can up - scatter off of @xmath20 and one would expect a larger scattering rate compared to lighter targets . however , an additional complication arises due to the large radius @xmath35 of a @xmath20 nucleus . in particular , when the momentum transfer is @xmath36 , the dark matter probes the size of the nucleus and the scattering is no longer coherent .",
    "therefore , the scattering rate is suppressed at recoil energies @xmath37 .",
    "this suppression occurs at lower recoil energies for @xmath20 , as compared to @xmath32 ( 55 kevnr versus 90 kevnr , respectively ) .",

    ", width=3 ]    the fact that the first zero of the @xmath20 form factor occurs at such a low recoil energy highlights an important challenge for cresst .",
    "the typical recoil energy an idm particle deposits on a @xmath20 nucleus is @xmath41 , where the signal is suppressed due to loss of coherence .",
    "the form factor suppression is evident in the recoil spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : recoilspectrum ] , which also illustrates the effects of three additional sources of uncertainties : dama s energy calibration , the dark matter interaction with the sm , and the velocity distribution profile . variations in any of these three sources can significantly alter idm s rate at cresst and ultimately affect the final exposure that will be required for cresst to exclude the dama idm hypothesis .",
    "dama only detects its nuclear recoil events with scintillation light .",
    "nuclear recoils typically deposit only a small fraction of their energy into scintillation .",
    "the quenching factor for @xmath31 , @xmath42 , relates the measured electron equivalent energy ( given in kevee ) to the nuclear recoil energy ( given in kevnr ) : @xmath43 where the energy dependence of the quenching factor is left explicit .",
    "most studies assume a constant quenching factor for iodine from @xmath44 kevnr , with the standard value taken to be @xmath38 . however , there are large experimental uncertainties in measurements of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the four primary ones @xcite give @xmath45 .",
    "the study in @xcite gives the smallest error , however its measurements are calibrated with 60 kev gamma rays , in contrast to the 3.2 kev electrons that dama uses @xcite .",
    "this difference reduces the central value of @xcite by roughly 10% and induces larger systematic effects .    lowering iodine s quenching factor effectively shifts dama s signal to higher nuclear recoil energies , favoring slightly larger values for the idm mass splitting ( @xmath46 kevnr for @xmath40 ) .",
    "consequently , the predicted signal at other experiments is also shifted to higher nuclear recoil energies .",
    "in addition , the spectral shape is broadened , because dama s reported rate is in units of cpd / kg / kevee .",

    "[ fig : quench ] shows the average annual rate for cresst s low and high energy range , assuming a shm profile .",
    "the shift of the idm signal to higher recoils translates into a significant reduction in cresst s average annual rate in the low recoil window of @xmath47 kevnr and a substantial enhancement in its rate in the high recoil range from @xmath48 kevnr .",
    "the effect of marginalizing over both the particle and halo parameters is substantial . as an illustration , if only the mass and cross section are marginalized over ( with fixed @xmath49 kev , @xmath50 km / s , @xmath51 km / s ) , then the average counts at cresst per 100 kg - d range from @xmath52 in the lower energy window and @xmath53 in the high energy window for @xmath54 . at xenon100 ,",

    "dama s spectrum peaks at @xmath71 while the tungsten spectrum at cresst peaks at @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast , interactions with @xmath73 predict substantially smaller rates at cresst : @xmath74 .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench ] for @xmath75 .",
    "there is little direct observational evidence for the dm density profile , and the velocity distribution is highly uncertain .",
    "while most studies assume a maxwell - boltzmann vdf ( [ shm ] ) , n - body simulations indicate that this ansatz does not adequately parameterize the vdf @xcite .",
    "the idm spectrum is particularly sensitive to changes in the tail of the velocity distribution profile , which can arise from velocity anisotropies or from dark matter substructure that has recently fallen into the galaxy @xcite .",
    "a vdf in which the high velocity tail is dominated by a stream of dark matter illustrates how changes in the local vdf alter idm predictions .",
    "this scenario can significantly lower the number of expected events ; other possibilities for the velocity profile will result in numbers of events between the shm and stream expectations .",
    "streams of dark matter are characterized by low velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "here , streams will be parameterized as dispersionless vdfs that have an arbitrary incident angle .",
    "the distribution profile is @xmath76 , with @xmath77 and @xmath78 given in the frame of the sun .",
    "the differential scattering rate is obtained after boosting to the earth s frame , and depends on the recoil energy through @xmath79 where @xmath10 is the earth s velocity in the frame of the solar system .",
    "the rate would be constant if not for the nuclear form factor that shapes the distribution and yields a highly peaked spectrum as illustrated for tungsten in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoilspectrum ] .",
    "the stream s velocity and incident angle relative to the earth are marginalized over and constraints on the phase and higher harmonics of the annual modulated rate are applied .",
    "these are set by the spectral decomposition of dama s modulated rate , which restricts the modulation to peak at may @xmath80 @xmath81 days and constrains the power spectrum at a frequency @xmath82 to be @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we apply these additional cuts on the models that survive the @xmath28 minimization .",

    "[ fig : quench ] shows the idm predictions for cresst when the tail of the vdf is dominated by a dispersionless dm stream .",
    "when the dark matter stream is nearly head - on in the summer , very few events are expected in the fall and winter months , which is consistent with the late - year running of the xenon100 calibration run .",
    "marginalizing over stream parameters shows that velocities @xmath84 400 km / s are favored , and that the dm incident angle with respect to the velocity of the earth on june 2 can be as large as @xmath85 , although 90% of the consistent models have incident angle @xmath86 and 75% have @xmath87 .",
    "[ fig : quench ] shows that the annual average rate at cresst for dark matter streams can deviate dramatically from the shm case and highlights the importance of marginalizing over parameters and considering different velocity profiles when making predictions for direct detection experiments .",
    "the previous section discussed how uncertainties in energy calibration , dark matter interactions , and vdfs significantly affect the range of predicted events at cresst . for @xmath88 kg - d ) exposures , the number of events in the low energy window can vary over an order of magnitude from @xmath89 , while the number in the high energy window ranges from @xmath90 .",
    "it is evident that having significant exposure over the full nuclear recoil band where the idm signal is expected to dominate ( 10 - 100 kevnr ) is essential for refuting or confirming a potential signal .",
    "the xenon100 experiment will accumulate large exposures @xmath91 kg - d ) in their current data run .",
    "compared to cresst , it has better coverage of the relevant nuclear recoil band because the @xmath32 target is not affected by form factor suppression at energies below @xmath92 kevnr .",
    "the dominant variation in predictions for spin - independent idm scattering rates in @xmath32 arises because dama s modulation fraction is not known and only constrained to be greater than 2% @xcite .",
    "larger modulation fractions at dama imply a proportionately smaller rate at xenon100 .    in their calibration run , xenon100 demonstrated the potential to be a  zero background \" experiment .",
    "the fact that no events were seen in their acceptance region implies a lower bound on the modulation fraction for idm of @xmath93 .",
    "their next data release , which will include summer data , will directly test the idm parameter space still allowed .",
    "[ fig : shmscan ] illustrates the average number of expected events for xenon100 ( per 1000 kg - d ) , including the uncertainties in @xmath42 , the dm form factor , and the vdf .",
    "again , there is an order of magnitude uncertainty , with the predictions ranging from 20 - 200 counts per 1000 kg - d . for the expected exposure of xenon100 s data release ,",
    "the minimum number of events predicted by idm is @xmath94 , which will be enough to confirm or refute the spin - independent idm scenario in a conclusive and model - independent manner .",
    "the process of testing the dama anomaly highlights many of the challenges inherent to direct detection experiments .",
    "in addition to determining the properties of the unknown dark matter particle , direct detection experiments must also consider the unknown flux of the incident dark matter , as well as uncertainties in converting a signal from one target nucleus to another .",
    "the predictions for both the cresst 2009 run and xenon100 2010 run show an order of magnitude uncertainty .",
    "the nuclear form factor for @xmath20 , when combined with additional theoretical and experimental uncertainties , will likely prevent cresst from refuting the idm hypothesis with an exposure of @xmath95 in a model - independent manner .",
    "xenon100 , on the other hand , will be able to make a definitive statement about a spin - independent , inelastically scattering dark matter candidate .",
    "still , the cresst 2009 data can potentially confirm idm for a large range of parameter space . in case of a positive signal ,",
    "the combined data from cresst and xenon100 will start probing the properties of the milky way dm profile and the interaction of the sm with the dark matter .",
