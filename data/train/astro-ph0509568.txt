    "the width of emission lines from the narrow line region ( nlr ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) has recently received a great deal of interest because it may provide a reasonably accurate , although not precise , estimate of the host galaxy spheroid velocity dispersion @xmath0 .",
    "the nlr @xmath3 fwhm/2.354 may therefore be a reasonable ` tertiary ' black hole mass @xmath4 estimator based on a series of empirical relations that originate with the @xmath5 relationship between the mass of a galaxy s central , supermassive black hole and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy s spheroid @xcite and the relation between @xmath0 and nlr line width from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and earlier work by whittle 1992b , c ) .",
    "subsequent measurements and analysis have found that the @xmath5 relationship has an intrinsic scatter of no more than 0.3 dex in @xmath6 and that this upper limit is due to present measurement uncertainties @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this relation and @xmath4 estimates from reverberation - mapping experiments to propose the use of @xmath7 measured from the [ ]  @xmath1 line to estimate the black hole mass .",
    "@xcite recently completed a direct comparison of @xmath0 and the gas velocity dispersion @xmath7 for approximately 2000 agns from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and showed that these widths are well correlated , although with considerable scatter .",
    "the empirical relation between @xmath7 and @xmath4 is important for a broad range of applications .",
    "these applications include estimates of @xmath4 for local agns , for agns at high redshift , and the cosmic evolution of supermassive black holes . for luminous agns with substantial continuum emission , or for agns at high redshift , the widths of the narrow emission lines may be the only method to determine @xmath0 . in conjunction with measurements of bolometric luminosity @xmath8 , estimates of @xmath4",
    "can also be used to calculate the accretion luminosity of agn in terms of the eddington ratio @xmath9 . at low - redshifts , black hole estimates from reverberation mapping have been shown to agree quite well with the slope of the slope of the @xmath5 relation @xcite and have been used to calibrate an additional secondary ( virial ) @xmath4 estimator based on the line width and luminosity of the broad , permitted lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used this virial relation to show that the [ ]  fwhm could be used to estimate @xmath4 to within a factor of five .",
    "the virial and @xmath7 estimates of @xmath4 have been used to explore the black hole masses and accretion rates in particular classes of agns , most notably the narrow line seyfert 1s @xcite , as well as to search for evolution in the @xmath5 relation @xcite .",
    "measurements of evolution in the @xmath5 relation , or skewness in the distribution of the scatter about this relation , could also provide valuable constraints on the formation history of supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "the utility of @xmath7 measurements as a proxy for @xmath4 in agns is largely limited by the substantial scatter in the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "the brightest line for @xmath7 measurements is the [ ]  @xmath10 line , although this line does suffer from substantial blue - side asymmetries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that dramatically affect the quality of the @xmath11 correlation .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath12 for the full profile of the [ ]  @xmath10 , while after removal of the blue - side asymmetry the result for the line core is @xmath13 .",
    "the other bright nlr lines , [ ]  @xmath14 and [ ]  @xmath2 , have lower ionization potentials and do not suffer from such substantial asymmetries .",
    "the scatter and quality of the @xmath11 relation for these lines is comparable to the core of the [ ]  line .",
    "while all of these correlations do strongly confirm the @xcite result that the kinematics of the nlr are dominated by gravity , the origin of the scatter is not clear .",
    "one potential origin of this scatter is a nonvirial contribution to the emission line widths .",
    "these contributions are clearly present in the blue - asymmetric [ ]  lines , but because these asymmetries are significantly stronger in high ionization lines like [ ] , compared to lower ionization lines like [ ]   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is good evidence that a range of spatial scales contribute to the observed nlr kinematics . beyond the gas kinematics that contribute to the [ ]  blue wings ,",
    "any nonvirial contribution to deviations from the @xmath11 correlation is evidently traced equally by the low ionization [ ]  lines and the core of the higher ionization [ ]  line , since these features show similar scatter .",
    "other potential origins for the scatter in the @xmath11 relation include the impact of compact radio jets and tidal distortions of the host galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that both of these quantities correlate with systematically larger @xmath7 at a given @xmath0 , although large - scale radio jets or tidal distortions are not present in most galaxies and therefore can not be responsible for the bulk of the scatter .",
    "small - scale radio jets may play a more significant role , however , as @xcite find approximately 60% of seyfert 1 galaxies qualify as radio loud when the nuclear radio and visible - wavelength flux is isolated from host galaxy emission .",
    "@xcite showed that the [ ]  lines are significantly broader in seyferts with linear radio morphology and high radio luminosity , which suggests radio jets can affect the nlr velocity field .",
    "the spatial distribution of the nlr gas within the bulge may also have a substantial impact on the observed value of @xmath7 . while the nlr gas must approximately trace the spheroid kinematics to produce this correlation ,",
    "spatially - resolved images indicate that the nlr is often approximately confined to a plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that rotation does contribute to the width of the [ ]  emission line , although it does not dominate .",
    "finally , @xcite investigated if host galaxy morphology , local environment , star formation rate , agn luminosity , and eddington ratio correlated with the observed scatter and only found evidence for systematically larger @xmath7 at higher eddington ratio . while all of these investigations have determined that tidal disturbances , the presence of a radio source , rotation , and eddington ratio contribute to the observed scatter , none of them dominate",
    ". it would be extremely valuable if the origin of the scatter in the @xmath11 correlation could be identified and substantially reduced , as then @xmath0 ( and @xmath4 ) could be estimated more precisely for agns .    further information on the origin of the scatter in the @xmath11 correlation , as well as a more general understanding of the nlr kinematics , may be gained from a high spatial resolution study .",
    "nearly all studies of nlr kinematics to date have employed ground - based , single - aperture measurements with aperture sizes on the order of a few arcseconds .",
    "such aperture sizes correspond to several hundred parsecs in projection and can include most of the nlr .",
    "there is good evidence , however , for the presence of stratification in the nlr , such as observations that higher - ionization and higher critical density lines tend to be broader @xcite , the presence of a blue , asymmetric wing on the higher - ionization [ ]  line and not on other , lower - ionization lines such as [ ] , and evidence for modest increases in electron density from recent _ hst _",
    "observations @xcite . the properties of [ ]  led @xcite to propose that asymmetries in the nlr are due to radial outflow and wind models of the nlr ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are supported by recent , spatially - resolved _ hst _  stis kinematics of ngc  4151 @xcite .",
    "these authors find evidence for both a rotational component and two , kinematically - distinct radial outflow components that appear to decelerate at larger scales .",
    "@xcite similarly studied the central 400 parsecs of ngc  1068 and found evidence for radial outflow driven by either wind or radiation pressure in the nuclear region , followed by deceleration on larger spatial scales .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze spatially - resolved spectroscopy of a large sample of nearby agn from archival stis observations and measure the nlr kinematics as a function of aperture size .",
    "we investigate the origin of the scatter in the @xmath11 correlation through a range of line width measurements at increasing aperture size , ranging from the limits of _ hst _  resolution to an aperture size typical of ground - based studies .",
    "we also study line asymmetries as a function of aperture size to investigate the spatial origin of line asymmetries .",
    "the sample properties and selection are described next in  [",
    "sec : sample ] and the nonstandard aspects of the data processing in ",
    "[ sec : datar ] .",
    "we describe the line width and asymmetry parameters in  [ sec : lineprof ] , along with the results of these measurements for different spatial scales in  [ sec : res ] .",
    "the implications of this work for the @xmath11 correlation and the kinematics of the nlr are then presented in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we summarize our results in the final section .",
    "we have adopted the sample of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter nw95 ) as the parent sample of this investigation of small - scale nlr kinematics because they have obtained high - quality ground - based measurements of many nlr emission features , as well as stellar velocity dispersions , for a wide range of galaxy types .",
    "their sample is largely drawn from the 140 seyfert galaxies discussed in @xcite , where their primary selection criteria was for strong mg _ b _",
    "( @xmath155175 ) and triplet ( @xmath158550 ) absorption features and weak emission ( which confuses mg _ b _ ) . with moderate spectral resolution ( 80230 km s@xmath16",
    "fwhm ) they measured the redshift , stellar kinematics ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , and a variety of characteristics for the [ ]  @xmath1 and [ ]  @xmath19 lines ( see  [ sec : lineprof ] ) .",
    "these high - quality ground - based data are a critical point of comparison for our study of the small - scale kinematics .",
    "we searched the _ hst _  archive and found 24 agns from the nw95 sample with moderate - resolution spectroscopy of either the [ ]  or [ ]  emission lines ( g430 m and g750 m gratings , respectively ) through either an @xmath20 or @xmath21 wide slit .",
    "the spectral resolution of the g750l and g430l gratings ( @xmath15500 km s@xmath16 ) is not high enough to resolve line width changes in nearly all of these sources , while in contrast the instrumental resolution is substantially higher for g430 m and g750 m .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 slit widths have a spectral resolution of @xmath22 pixels fwhm for point sources and the g430 m and g750 m gratings have dispersions of 0.28 and 0.56  / pixel .",
    "the instrumental velocity resolution fwhm is therefore 25 and 40 km s@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the resolution is approximately a factor of @xmath23 times larger for an unresolved source that uniformly fills the @xmath21 slit and a factor of @xmath24 times larger for the @xmath20 slit .",
    "the stis plate scale is @xmath25 per pixel and the slit length is @xmath26 .",
    "the details of our sample , including host galaxy properties , program i d , and observing mode , are provided in table  [ tbl : data ] . of the 24 galaxies ,",
    "only ngc  2110 has observations with both the g430 m and g750 m settings .",

    "our sample is drawn from many different stis observing programs and thus the objects were obtained with many different observing sequences .",
    "the reduction steps therefore vary from galaxy to galaxy depending upon the number of dithered exposures , the number of cr - split frames , and if the observations were obtained prior to the primary ( side 1 ) stis electronics failure on 2001 may 16 .",
    "we found that the reduced spectra taken directly out of the calstis pipeline are not of optimum quality for any of our galaxies . in this section",
    "we discuss our modifications to the calstis pipeline for the various observing sequences employed to obtain these archival data .",
    "twelve of our 24 galaxies ( those obtained for proposals 7361 , 8055 , and 9143 ) include multiple exposures of the nucleus and employed integer pixel dithering along the slit .",
    "these exposures had only one cr - split frame , and thus the calstis pipeline reduction did not include cosmic ray correction .",
    "to account for the cosmic rays , we broke out of the calstis pipeline after the dark - subtraction , bias - subtraction , and flat - fielding for each exposure ( using the _ flt.fits calibration file ) . after aligning the exposures",
    ", we used the laplacian cosmic ray identification iraf routine ( l.a .",
    "cosmic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to create a bad pixel map for each 2-d spectrum .",
    "the pixels flagged as cosmic rays by l.a .",
    "cosmic were then rejected when the multiple spectra were combined .",
    "cosmic occasionally mistook spectral features for cosmic rays , leaving emission lines blank in the final combined image . in these cases we replaced the empty pixels with the corresponding values from the original _ flt image .",
    "once the cosmic - ray cleaning was complete , we re - inserted this combined , cosmic ray - rejected file into the calstis pipeline for the final wavelength and flux calibrations .",
    "when multiple images were obtained at the same pointing , the exposures could be combined with the ocrreject step in the calstis pipeline to produce a cosmic ray corrected image .",
    "we have run the spectra from galaxies with multiple cr - splits listed in table  [ tbl : data ] up through this cosmic ray rejection step in the calstis pipeline .",
    "however , even with multiple cr - splits , the pipeline output most often is still peppered with cosmic rays .",
    "we thus used l.a .",
    "cosmic to zap the remaining rays in the ocrreject output ( _ crj.fits image ) before re - inserting the spectra into the pipeline for the wavelength and flux calibrations .",
    "the ten datasets for proposal 9143 were obtained after 2001 may 16 , when the side 1 stis electronics failed . the side 2 electronics do not have closed - loop temperature control of the ccd and this results in a dark rate that varies with temperature . thus the dark calibration image is a poor approximation to the real dark rates for hot pixels and the outputs of the calstis pipeline have many strongly negative pixels after the dark - subtraction step .",
    "unfortunately , even the dithering scheme employed for this proposal did not easily remove the negative holes created in the images .    to correct for these negative pixels , we roughly followed the method outlined by pogge et al .",
    "( 2005 , _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "from the combined , cosmic ray - rejected image for each galaxy ( see  [ sec : dither ] ) , we created a list of pixels that fell more than 3-@xmath27 below the background median , which we fed into a custom iraf script that replaced each negative pixel with the mean of its surrounding 3@xmath283-pixel box .",
    "we then re - inserted this corrected image into the calstis pipeline . for images obtained prior to the side 1 electronics failure , hot pixels that remained after the dark correction were eliminated as part of the cosmic ray cleaning step .",
    "once these steps were complete , we extracted 1-d spectra of different aperture sizes from the 2-d spectra using the calstis x1d routine , which performs a geometric rectification and background subtraction . for each galaxy we extracted spectra with apertures of integer pixel sizes from 250 centered on the nucleus , corresponding to angular sizes of @xmath29 .",
    "we chose to integrate progressively wider apertures , rather than attempt to measure the differential line profiles as a function of radius , because one of the main goals of our study is to characterize the transition between nlr profiles on very small scales and the ground - based apertures used in previous work .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] presents three 1-d spectra for each of the 24 galaxies in the sample .",
    "the leftmost column of panels plots each galaxy s spectrum summed over an @xmath21 aperture , which approximately represents the nuclear emission unresolved by stis .",
    "the middle column of panels plots the sum of a @xmath30 aperture centered on the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath30 aperture was chosen as a compromise between the resolution of previous ground - based studies and the angular extent over which emission lines are detectable in most of the stis spectra .",
    "finally , the rightmost column of panels shows the difference of the middle and leftmost panels .",
    "the difference spectra in these panels thus illustrate the line profiles _ outside _ of the nucleus and will be discussed below in the context of line widths and asymmetries outside of the nuclear region .",
    "we applied a scalar throughput correction to the flux - calibrated @xmath21 spectra ( 4-pixel extraction box height ) produced by x1d because the default throughput correction table ( referenced by the pctab keyword ) does not include an entry for a 4-pixel extraction box height .",
    "when a 4-pixel extraction box height is requested , the throughput value for a 3-pixel box height is employed instead by default , although the throughput is approximately 10% larger for a 4-pixel box compared to a 3-pixel box .",
    "the default behavior of x1d therefore overestimates the flux in a 4-pixel box when it assumes the lower throughput appropriate for a 3-pixel box . to properly correct the @xmath21 spectra",
    ", we interpolated the throughput values in the correction table to calculate the appropriate quantity for a 4-pixel box height for each instrument configuration and then applied this throughput correction to the x1d output .",
    "also , we note that while the throughput correction in the table was calculated from observations of a point source , the agn in this sample are dominated by unresolved nuclear emission and this correction table is a reasonable approximation .",
    "this throughput correction is only relevant to the @xmath31 and @xmath21 spectra shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] because the correction is negligible at @xmath30 .",
    "the correction also does not affect the width measurements because the spectra are only multipled by a constant .",
    "we have chosen to characterize the line profiles of the [ ]  and [ ]   emission lines as a function of aperture size through line widths measured at a range of heights , interpercentile velocity widths ( ipvs ) , and asymmetry measures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for these four bright galaxies , we had sufficient signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum to justify a power - law fit .",
    "the stis slit size is sufficiently narrow that no significant stellar features appear to contaminate the continuum .",
    "we have characterized the mean velocity structure in the [ ]   @xmath32 and [ ]  @xmath33 emission lines through measurement of fw20 , fwhm , and fw80 , which are the line widths at 20% , 50% , and 80% of the peak height , respectively .",
    "these parameters , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : def ] , yield the base widths , core widths , and top profile widths described in @xcite .",
    "we have linearly interpolated the flux between wavelength bins ( @xmath150.28   for the g750 m and g430 m gratings ) to measure the widths . the value fwhm/2.354 was used for comparison with the stellar velocity dispersion measurements measured by @xcite .",
    "several of the agns have sufficiently blended [ ]  lines such that the flux between the 6717 , 6731  doublet exceeds the 20 percent peak value for both lines . for the",
    "most severely blended of these , the fwhm value was undefined as well , and for ngc  1052 and ngc  2110 the fw80 value could not be measured .",

    "as noted in section  [ sec : sample ] , the fwhm velocity resolution of the g430 m and g750 m gratings are @xmath36 and 40 km s@xmath16 , respectively , for an unresolved point source and a factor of up to @xmath37 times higher for a source that fills the slit . the most commonly used method to correct for broadening due to the instrumental resolution is to subtract the width of the instrumental resolution in quadrature .",
    "this correction is can not be performed with great accuracy for these observations because there is a substantial difference in resolution between unresolved and resolved emission and both sources of emission likely contribute to the observed emission line profile .",
    "however , we can estimate the magnitude of this effect for the narrowest lines in our sample , which have fwhm @xmath38 km s@xmath16  ( see table  [ tbl : width ] ) , and represent the most affected measurements .",
    "if this emission were completely unresolved the correction would be less than 5% and if it uniformly filled the slit it would be less than 30% . because the two - dimensional spectra of these sources all indicate that the emission - line gas is centrally peaked , we estimate that the majority of the emission in the smallest aperture is still unresolved .",
    "we therefore conclude that instrumental resolution makes at most a small contribution to our reported line widths .",
    "for the majority of our sample , the line widths are sufficiently broad that this correction is less than 10% even with the most extreme assumption that the emission uniformly fills the aperture .",
    "we also note that the instrumental resolution correction is likely to be more important for the line core ( fw80 ) than at smaller fractions of the peak height ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in their study of 1749 agns spectra from the sdss",
    ", @xcite found that the moments of gaussian fits to the profiles provide more robust widths than direct measurements from the spectra .",
    "the sdss data are typically lower signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and width measurements can be more uncertain in the low snr regime . the stis spectra used for our sample generally have sufficient snr and resolution that we can confidently measure emission line widths without assuming any model for the line shape .",
    "also , because the majority of the line profiles have a blue or redshifted wing and/or a broad central component , measuring widths directly from the data allows us to avoid approximating single values of the moments from a combination of multiple gaussian components .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in direct measurement of the line widths is the continuum level because these lines have high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "as noted above in section  [ sec : continuum ] , we fit the continuum by either a constant or a power law .",
    "the line width measurement uncertainty depends on both the uncertainty in the continuum level and the line profile shape , as for example a given continuum uncertainty will produce a smaller width uncertainty in a broad line than a narrow line .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainties in our direct width measurements are less than 5% .",
    "the width measurements that required gaussian fits have a formal uncertainty of approximately 5% @xcite , although this is only a true estimate if the lines can be correctly represented by gaussians .",
    "those cases where the fitting routine varied between direct width measurements and gaussians ( the switch between black and gray symbols in figure  [ fig : width ] ) indicate that the uncertainties are at most 10% .",
    "the lack of substantial stellar continuum emission in the extremely narrow stis slit removes a potentially significant source of the uncertainty in width measurements based on ground - based observations , which may be particularly relevant for fainter emission lines such as [ ] .",
    "@xcite advocates the use of area measurements to define line width parameters , rather than simple cuts at varying heights , because they have an integral nature and are thus smoothly defined and less sensitive to the presence of noise or the effects of instrument resolution .",
    "his definitions of the interpercentile velocity widths ( ipv10 and ipv20 ) and asymmetries ( a10 and a20 ) are also illustrated in figure  2 .",
    "the median is the wavelength that denotes the center of area for the profile , and the lengths a , b , c , and d represent the separation between the median and the profile s 10% , 90% , 20% , and 80% area values , respectively .",
    "the ipv10 parameter characterizes the base and wings of the profile , much as did the fw20 width suggested by @xcite , while the ipv20 parameter and higher percentage areas characterize the line core .",
    "the a10 and a20 values serve to clearly quantify the profile s red or blue asymmetry .",
    "we have chosen to measure our area parameters from gaussian fits to the line profiles , rather than directly from the data as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this choice was driven by the [ ]  lines , which are mildly to severely blended in all of our sources . because these lines are blended",
    ", we could not measure the interpercentile markers in the same manner as @xcite for the more isolated [ ]  @xmath10 line .",
    "we experimented with taking the 10 and 20 percentile markers of the total [ ]  doublet area from the blue wing of the 6717  line , and the 80 and 90 percentile markers from the red wing of the 6731  line , and then scaling the widths a , b , c and d by the relative widths of the [ ]  lines , but the potentially variable line ratio of the [ ]  doublet made this approach uncertain . in the end",
    ", we found that the gaussian profiles provided more robust measurements of the area parameters , as we were able to isolate the separate contributions to the line profile from each of the [ ]  lines . also , the gaussian fits allowed us to avoid the subtleties in treating fractional wavelength increments discussed by @xcite .",
    "very few of these galaxies are well fit by a single gaussian .",
    "the [ ]  line often has an asymmetric blue wing in addition to a broad central component , and so we allow for up to three gaussian components in our fitting routines . with the exception of the sources with bright agn continua , we fit a constant continuum term .",
    "we fit the [ ]  @xmath39 and 5007 lines simultaneously with their wavelength separation and relative strengths fixed to the theoretical ratio of 3:1 determined by atomic physics .",
    "for the [ ]  doublet we also fit the two lines simultaneously and with a fixed separation , although we allow their relative line strengths to vary because the [ ]  @xmath406717/@xmath406731 ratio is sensitive to electron density . in principle",
    ", the line widths of the 6717  and 6731  lines may be different due to stratification in the nlr , so we initially allowed the widths of the two lines to vary in our fitting routine .",
    "however , we found that the widths of the two lines differed by less than 3% , which is within the error of the gaussian fit parameters described in the previous section .",
    "we therefore fixed the widths of these two lines in the fitting routine .",
    "the fitting routine employed here was adopted from @xcite .",
    "the first step is to fit a single gaussian to the profile , and then we allow a second central component centered between -5  and + 5  of the line peak ( although occasionally the component was best fit outside these limits ) .",
    "we keep this second component if the @xmath41 value for the fit improves by at least 20% . for [ ]  we experimented with a third , blue component that was generally centered between -20  and 0  of the central component .",
    "again we kept this component when @xmath41 improved by at least 20% .",
    "for the [ ]  lines we only allowed for one additional component between -10  and + 10  of the line peak .",
    "the best fits from our gaussian routine for each forbidden line profile are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] and the fit residuals are plotted below the spectrum in each panel .",

    "our measurements of the @xcite asymmetry parameters listed in table  [ tbl : asym ] confirm that asymmetries are more common in [ ]   and these values are illlustrated in figure  [ fig : asym ] . within the @xmath21 aperture we find that 6/7 galaxies with [ ]  observations have @xmath44 , while 9/18 galaxies with [ ]  observations have such asymmetries . while we observe asymmetries less frequently in [ ]  than [ ]",
    ", we still measure asymmetries in a substantially larger fraction of galaxies than typically observed in ground - based observations and we discuss this point further below .",
    "two particularly extreme cases of asymmetries are ngc  1667 [ ]  and ngc  5194 [ ] .",
    "the asymmetries are less pronounced in the larger @xmath30 aperture , where only 7/18 galaxies in the [ ]  sample and 5/7 in the [ ]  sample have such significant asymmetries .",
    "several of these galaxies exhibit rather unusual asymmetries .",
    "while most have blue asymmetries , several have significant red asymmetries .",
    "one peculiar case is mkn  573 , which is more asymmetric on larger scales _ and _ this larger - scale asymmetry is red : @xmath45 in the @xmath30 aperture .",
    "inspection of _ hst _  images of mkn  573 @xcite reveals that the strong red asymmetry outside of the nucleus is due to the chance intersection of the stis slit with an individual nlr cloud .",
    "mkn  270 [ ] , ngc  1667 [ ] , and ngc  5194 [ ]  also exhibit significant red asymmetries in the @xmath21 aperture spectra , although are less asymmetric on larger scales .",
    "the red - asymmetric component in these cases is broader than the core .",
    "blue asymmetries in [ ]  were suggested by @xcite to be due to a combination of radial outflow from the nuclear region and gas and dust that obscures the redshifted emission from the far side of the galaxy .",
    "the blue asymmetries confined to the nuclear region in ngc  4051 , ngc  5347 , and mkn  348 agree well with this interpretation .",
    "ngc  7682 and mkn  1066 have pronounced asymmetries on larger scales as well ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) . for these two galaxies",
    "@xmath30 corresponds to several hundred parsecs and would require a large obscuring medium .",
    "we have also investigated the scale - dependence of asymmetries with the spectra shown in the rightmost panels of figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "these spectra are the difference between the spectrum of each galaxy summed with a @xmath30 aperture and a @xmath21 aperture and therefore effectively isolate the emission - line component due to material outside of the nuclear region .",
    "the two vertical lines in each panel for a given galaxy correspond to the line peak of the emission lines in the @xmath30 aperture .",
    "the line profiles in the rightmost panels relative to these vertical lines therefore illustrate the extent to which emitting material outside of @xmath21 contributes to any asymmetries in the line profiles . to characterize the line asymmetry outside of the nuclear , @xmath21 aperture , we calculated the fraction of the total @xmath31 line flux on the blue side of the line centroid in the @xmath30 aperture .",
    "a fraction greater than 0.5 corresponds to a blue asymmetry , while less than 0.5 corresponds to a red asymmetry .",
    "these values are listed in the last column of table  [ tbl : asym ] .",
    "eight galaxies have strong blue asymmetries outside of @xmath21 ( fraction @xmath46 ) , two have strong red asymmetries ( fraction @xmath47 ) , and the remaining 14 are either relatively symmetric ( ten ) or have little flux outside of @xmath21 ( five ) in the stis aperture . the significant asymmetry in ngc  2110",
    "is only seen in [ ] .",
    "the changes in the nlr velocity field in the stis aperture have revealed pronounced differences between the unresolved , nuclear kinematics and the nlr on larger scales , yet these larger - scale kinematics still subtend only a fraction of the nlr for many galaxies because of the narrow stis slit . even the line characteristics measured from the integrated stis slit may therefore differ from ground - based flux measurements .",
    "we estimated the fraction of the nlr observed with these observations through a comparison of the total flux in the stis aperture and the value reported in the ground - based measurements from @xcite .",
    "this comparison demonstrated that the stis aperture includes between 25% and 90% of the [ ]  flux measured by @xcite for the seven galaxies with stis [ ]  measurements . the velocity field sampled by the stis apertures",
    "also may depend on the orientation of the spectroscopic slit relative to the major axis of the host galaxies , as there is evidence that rotation is partly responsible for the nlr widths @xcite , or the orientation relative to the nlr and radio jet axis , which are known to be unrelated to the host galaxy semimajor axis @xcite .",
    "however , the orientation for most of these observations were not specified in order to reduce scheduling constraints .",
    "one striking characteristic of figures  [ fig : width ] and [ fig : ipv ] is how poorly the line profile measurements agree with the ground - based values on even the largest scales ( see also figure  [ fig : bigcomp ] ) . of the 24 galaxies with measured fwhm in the @xmath30 aperture , the fwhm of only six ( ngc  1358 , ngc  3031 , ngc  3982 , ngc  4051 , ngc  4151 , and ngc  7674 ) are within 10% of the ground - based value ( see table  [ tbl : width ] ) , while 12 are discrepant by greater than 30%  comparable to the observed scatter in the @xmath11 correlation .",
    "surprisingly , one of these 12 measurements ( ngc  2110 [ ] ) is actually @xmath48% larger in the stis aperture than in the ground - based measurement .",
    "this broad , nuclear component is quite obvious in figure  [ fig : spectra ] . for ngc  3516 the difference between the stis and nw95 measurements can be attributed to the slit orientation as this galaxy is known to have a large , extended nlr @xcite , yet we detect little emission in our slit outside of the nuclear region .",
    "for the seven galaxies with [ ]  measurements , we examined the difference between the fwhm in our @xmath30 aperture and the ground - based value as a function of the fraction of the flux within the @xmath30 stis aperture .",
    "the stis flux measurement for ngc  7674 includes 90% of the ground - based value reported by @xcite and our measured fwhm is within 10% of his value .",
    "this confirms that when most of the ground - based flux falls within our much narrower aperture we measure the same kinematics . for the other six galaxies these data",
    "miss a larger fraction of the total flux and the line widths are quite different in some instances .",
    "the most notable is the stis measurement of mkn  348 , which includes 60% of the ground - based value and is 60% narrower .",
    "the stis measurements of the remaining five galaxies include only 30% of the flux in the @xcite aperture and the differences in width between the two aperture sizes range between none ( ngc  4151 ) and 150% ( ngc  5929 ) .",
    "the disagreement between widths measured in our @xmath30 aperture and the ground - based aperture is more striking for ipv20 ( see also table  [ tbl : ipv ] ) than for line widths as only two galaxies ( ngc  4051 and ngc  4151 ) have stis @xmath30 and nw95 measurements that agree within 10% . the majority ( 15/24 )",
    "have nw95 values @xmath48% larger than the stis measurements and 2/24 ( ngc  7682 and ngc  2110 [ ] ) are less than @xmath43% of the ground - based measurements",
    ". however , we note that most differences in ipv20 between the stis @xmath30 and nw95 are comparisons between stis [ ]  and nw95 [ ]   measurements and they may therefore partly reflect more pronounced wings in the [ ]  line relative to [ ] . for example , ngc  2110 has a @xmath30 ipv20 = 423 km s@xmath16  for [ ]  and ipv20 = 1105 km s@xmath16  for [ ] .",
    "nw95 measured 655 km s@xmath16  for [ ] .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : asym ] , there are also substantial differences between the fraction of agn with asymmetries in the low - excitation [ ]   line in these data and ground - based measurements .",
    "this change may be due to the dilution of nuclear asymmetries by larger - scale emission from host galaxy starlight or more symmetric emission from the nlr on larger scales .",
    "host galaxy dilution may in particular explain why we detect significant asymmetries in such a large fraction of the [ ]  profiles compared to expectations from ground - based programs @xcite .",
    "this result implies that the asymmetries are primarily due to nuclear line - emitting gas , rather than material more evenly distributed throughout the nlr on larger scales .",
    "this comparison of width and ipv values suggest that measurements within the stis aperture are generally smaller than the ground - based values .",
    "a quantitative comparison demonstrates that this is the case , relative to both ground - based nlr width measurements and @xmath0 ( see table  [ tbl : stats ] and figure  [ fig : bigcomp ] ) .",
    "comparison of the stis fwhm measurements in @xmath21 , @xmath30 , 100pc , and 200pc apertures ( divided by 2.354 to approximate a gaussian @xmath7 ) to @xmath0 show that the stis measurements systematically underestimate @xmath0 by 10  20% .",
    "the stis measurements similarly underestimate the ground - based nw95 fwhm measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : bigcomp ] does not show any significant evidence for differences between [ ]  and [ ] .",
    "the scatter between stis and @xmath0 measurements is slightly worse ( 30  40% ) than the scatter between stis and nw95 fwhm measurements ( 20  40% ) .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ fig : smallcomp ] indicates that stis measurements at @xmath21 and @xmath30 and 100pc and 200pc are significantly more similar in value and have substantially less scatter ( 10  20% , see also table  [ tbl : stats ] ) .",
    "the smaller measured widths in the stis slit is likely due to the collisional nature of gas , which will therefore tend to reside at least partially in a disk .",
    "a narrow slit at a random orientation will then sample a smaller fraction of the full radial velocity field than a larger aperture slit and therefore measure a smaller width .",

    "in addition to the quality of the correlations between line widths measured in various apertures and @xmath0 , we also searched for systematic trends between the residuals and the properties of the galaxies .",
    "we specifically investigated the residuals between the measurements in the @xmath30 aperture and @xmath0 as a function of distance , hubble type , fraction of the galaxy in a @xmath30 aperture , and radio power .",
    "significant residuals as a function of galaxy distance , hubble type , and fraction of the angular size of the galaxy subtended by the spectroscopic slit would indicate very useful information about the origin of the scatter in the @xmath11 relation and these quantities could potentially be used to empirically determine corrections to reduce scatter , as well as provide insight into its origin .",
    "for example , the nlr measured exactly within the host bulge s effective radius might prove to be the best tracer of @xmath0 .",
    "some evidence for such a relation might be revealed in the residuals plotted against these three parameters , however as shown in figure  [ fig : res ] there is no evidence that the residuals are correlated with any of these parameters .",
    "@xcite found evidence that seyfert galaxies with linear radio morphology and high luminosity tend to have broader lines .",

    "broader emission - line widths include @xmath55 @xcite and disturbed morphologies @xcite , however this sample does not contain a sufficient number of objects with either high accretion - rates or significantly - disturbed morphologies to investigate these quantities . @xcite",
    "also recently noted that strongly blueshifted [ ]  lines ( relative to the host galaxy ) were systematically broader than similar objects that were not blueshifted .",
    "these objects tended to be those with large @xmath55 .",
    "none of the seven galaxies in our [ ]  sample have substantial blueshifts .",
    "we have conducted a detailed analysis of spatially - resolved [ ]  and [ ]   nlr emission from 24 well - studied , nearby agn .",
    "these observations have detected considerable emission outside of the unresolved nucleus ( @xmath21 or 10  100pc ) and this emission often contributes significantly to the measured line profiles at larger scales .",
    "we have characterized the spatial dependence of this emission with a range of width , area , and asymmetry measurements and shown there are not only substantial changes from @xmath21 to @xmath30 ( typical of ground - based observations ) , but also from a @xmath30 long stis aperture ( with either a @xmath20 or @xmath21 width ) and the approximately @xmath56 or larger aperture used for ground - based measurements of these galaxies . in particular , the large variations in line profiles",
    "as a function of aperture size demonstrates that the profile of the nlr lines are set by the kinematics of the gas in the nlr itself , and not just radiatively - driven winds from the nucleus .",
    "the spatial scale(s ) responsible for the nlr emission lines has received substantial recent attention because the widths of the nlr lines may be used to estimate the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath0 , which in turn can be used as a proxy for the black hole mass @xmath4 .",
    "our analysis shows that even at the largest spatial scales observed with stis , the line widths are systematically smaller by 10  20% than ground - based width measurements ( as well as @xmath0 ) .",
    "as we estimate that the stis slit may include as little as 25% of the nlr flux , emission on larger scales or outside of the narrow stis slit width must broaden the line profiles .",
    "while the line profile measurements from the stis data are systematically less than the ground - based nlr and @xmath0 values , the scatter is comparable .",
    "the substantial scatter in the @xmath11 relation therefore appears to be due to a sufficiently complex set of parameters that it is effectively stochastic , at least to the extent that the scatter can not be reduced to the magnitude of the scatter in the @xmath57 relation .",
    "in addition to rotation , eddington ratio , and compact radio jets , the list of parameters that increase the scatter should include the clumpiness of the nlr , the orientation of the nlr with respect to the host galaxy semimajor axis , and the amount and distribution of dust in the nlr .",
    "if the nlr were as isotropic as the stellar distribution , the scatter would be comparable to the @xmath57 relation , yet because the gas is collisional , and also clumpy , it can not be as good a tracer of the bulge potential .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the substantial and diverse types of width variations observed in these spatially - resolved measurements .",
    "specifically , the most common types of line width variation are @xmath58% changes between the @xmath21 , @xmath30 , and nw95 apertures ( nine galaxies ) and relatively little width increase in the stis aperture , but a substantial increase ( @xmath48% ) between the @xmath30 stis and nw95 measurements ( also nine galaxies ) .",
    "the remaining types of variations observed are greater than 30% width changes on the stis scales only ( four ) and on all scales ( two ) .",
    "two of the four galaxies with only substantial profiles changes on the stis scale have substantially broader emission in the @xmath21 than in the @xmath30 aperture .",
    "these large nuclear velocities may be due to radiatively - driven winds that decelerate or simply do not extend to larger scales .",
    "however , neither of these nuclear line profiles exhibit substantial asymmetries , which suggests that if this emission is due to a uniform outflow , there is not substantial dust in the nuclear region .",
    "both red and blue asymmetries are observed in the [ ]  and [ ]  line profiles .",
    "these observations are unusual in two respects .",
    "first , asymmetries in [ ]  are reported far less frequently than in [ ] , yet we observe [ ]  asymmetries with nearly comparable frequency .",
    "the low frequency of observed [ ]  asymmetries in ground - based observations have been ascribed to the fact that [ ]  is a lower - ionization line .",
    "our observations suggest that asymmetries are commonly present in [ ] , but the weaker [ ]  emission is more easily diluted by host galaxy starlight and not as readily observed in the larger ground - based apertures . secondly",
    ", we observe several examples of galaxies with red asymmetries in either [ ]  or [ ] .",
    "for the cases in which the red asymmetries are largely confined to the unresolved nuclear spectrum , these observations do not agree well with outflow models that produce blue asymmetries through invocation of obscuration of the far side of the galaxy .",
    "these red asymmetries may be due to the patchy nature of the ism on very small scales , which may produce uneven illumination of nlr clouds and a patchy line - of - sight velocity distribution for the nlr clouds .",
    "such variations within the nlr may be responsible for the bulk of the scatter in the @xmath11 correlation .",
