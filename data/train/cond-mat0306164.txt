    "polyelectrolytes ( pes ) are polymers which have the ability to dissociate charges in polar solvents resulting in charged polymer chains ( macroions ) and small mobile counterions  @xcite . because of their great relevance in technical applications as well as in molecular biology",
    "they enjoy an increasing attention in the scientific community  @xcite . the combination of macromolecular properties and long - range electrostatic interactions results in an impressive variety of phenomena which makes these systems interesting from a fundamental point of view .",
    "in this paper we focus on the special case of polyelectrolytes under poor solvent conditions .",
    "the reason for this is that a large number of polymers are based on a hydrocarbon backbone for which water is a very poor solvent .",
    "the solubility in water is often only given due to their charged side groups .",
    "important examples are sulfonated poly - styrene ( pss ) , poly - methacrylic acid ( pma ) , dna and virtually all proteins .",
    "the poor solvent conditions give rise to a competition between the attractive interactions due to the poor solubility of the backbone and the electrostatic repulsion of the pe charges .",
    "this can lead to elongated strings of locally collapsed structures ( pearls ) , commonly called pearl - necklaces .",
    "such necklace conformations have been proposed on the basis of fluorescence studies  @xcite .",
    "they have also been predicted in terms of scaling arguments in refs .",
    "@xcite for a weakly charged single chain pe .",
    "later this has been extended to strongly charged chains and finite concentrations  @xcite .",
    "also other theoretical approaches support the existence of necklace conformations  @xcite . the scaling approach of ref .",
    "@xcite was supplemented with a monte carlo simulation of a single chain that shows a cascade from one to two to three globules with increasing strength of the electrostatic repulsion . in their study",
    "the polyelectrolyte was weakly charged and every monomer carried a fractional charge .",
    "the chain was studied in the infinite dilution limit , where counterions have not to be taken into account .",
    "the formation of the necklace structure is due to the rayleigh instability of a charged droplet which leads to a split once a critical charge is reached .",
    "the size of the pearls is determined by the balance between electrostatic repulsion and surface tension .",
    "the distance between two pearls is governed by the balance of the electrostatic pearl - pearl repulsion and the surface tension .",
    "some aspects of the theoretical pearl - necklace picture have been confirmed by simulations using the debye - hckel approximation  @xcite and with explicit counterions  @xcite . however , there is up to now no clear experimental proof for the existence of necklace chains .",
    "conformational chain properties have been observed which seem to be consistent with the necklace picture  @xcite .",
    "also the scaling of the peak position of the structure factor @xmath0 with the polymer density @xmath1 has been thoroughly investigated which however reveals only properties that occur in the semi - dilute regime of interacting chains . for good solvent chains in the semi",
    "dilute regime the exponent @xmath2 in the scaling relation @xmath3 was measured to be @xmath4 which is also the theoretically predicted value  @xcite whereas for poor solvent polyelectrolytes no single value for the exponent seems to exist .",
    "the experimental values vary between @xmath5 and @xmath4  @xcite and show a dependence on the charge fraction of monomers which is implicitly also responsible for the poor solvent parameter of the chain .",
    "the theoretical predictions show ( for fixed poor solvent and fixed charge fraction ) also a complicated transition from a @xmath6 regime via a @xmath7 into a crossover scaling  @xcite , whereas recent simulations measured a constant exponent @xmath7 for the whole concentration range from semi - dilute up into the dense regime  @xcite , so its fair to say that things are far from being well understood .",
    "however , even for the dilute concentration regime , the situation can be more complicated as envisioned in the scaling approach , since the entropy of the chain and of the counterions as well as the electrostatic interaction between counterions and the pe charges have to be taken into account . in our previous shorter communications",
    "we reported large conformational fluctuations  @xcite in the pearl - necklace structures and showed that they were responsible for the absence of strong signatures in the force extension relation and in the form factor .",
    "the aim of the present simulational study is a more detailed investigation of the structure of strongly charged polyelectrolytes in poor solvent in the dilute concentration regime where the chain - chain interaction is weak so that one deals effectively with single chain properties .",
    "our focus will be a thorough data analysis of the observed pearl - necklace conformations .",
    "to this end we had to develop a new cluster recognition algorithm that is capable to characterize these interesting conformations automatically from our simulated configurational data .",
    "moreover we look at the stability of the pearl - necklace conformations in the presence of condensed counterions , and perform a study of the coulomb induced collapse transition . we will compare our results with predictions from scaling theory and will discuss the validity range of the scaling approach for strongly charged chains at finite density .",
    "we then attempt to give a preliminary phase diagram for the systems studied .",
    "the last part will be devoted to some experimentally accessible observables , like characteristic chain size ratios and form factor .",
    "this should be helpful in supporting the evaluation of experimental data in terms of pearl - necklace signatures .",

    "we give a detailed overview of the simulated systems , including a list of parameters and results for selected basic observables .",
    "our model of a pe solution and our molecular dynamics approach has been described previously in detail in  @xcite .",
    "it consists of @xmath8 flexible bead - spring chains with @xmath9 monomers and @xmath10 counterions which are located in a cubic simulation box of length @xmath11 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a fraction @xmath12 of the monomers is monovalently charged ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus the total charge per chain is @xmath14 .",
    "the number of counterions which are also monovalently charged ( @xmath15 ) is chosen such that the overall system is electrically neutral .",
    "densities are given either as monomer density @xmath16 or charge density @xmath17 .",
    "all particles interact via a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath18 $ ] for distances @xmath19 and zero elsewhere .",
    "the constant @xmath20 is chosen such that the potential value is zero at the cutoff @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a measure of the solvent quality .",
    "monomers interact up to @xmath23 giving them a short range attraction which can be tuned by changing the value of @xmath22 .",
    "the counterions interact via a purely repulsive lj interaction with @xmath24 .",
    "the units of length , energy and time are @xmath25 , @xmath22 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the chain monomers are in addition connected along the chain by the finite extendible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) bond potential of the form @xmath27 $ ] which results in an average bond length @xmath28 .    charged particles with charges @xmath29 and @xmath30 at separation @xmath31 interact via the coulomb energy @xmath32 where the bjerrum length is defined as @xmath33 ( @xmath34 : unit charge , @xmath35 and @xmath36 : permittivity of the vacuum and of the solvent ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction was calculated with the p3m - algorithm  @xcite , tuned to force accuracies which are much higher than the thermal noise level .",
    "a velocity verlet algorithm with a standard langevin thermostat is used to integrate the equation of motion  @xcite ( friction coefficient @xmath37 , time step @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus the solvent is only implicitly present via its permittivity @xmath39 , the friction constant @xmath40 and the solvent quality parameter @xmath22 in the lj potential .",
    "the simulation time after equilibration for all systems was at least @xmath41 times the measured correlation time for the end - to - end distance @xmath42 and the chains centers of mass diffused at least several radii of gyration @xmath43 .",
    "the osmotic pressure @xmath44 was measured to be always positive and additional simulations over a large density range  @xcite showed that the @xmath45 diagram is convex at all densities , thus our simulations are stable , reach true thermal equilibrium , and reside in a one phase region .",
    "the volume density inside the pearls does not exceed @xmath46 which is below the glass transition .",
    "we therefore are certain that also the pearl formation and restructuring was observed in equilibrium .",
    "we have simulated our poor solvent polyelectrolytes mainly as a function of the parameters chain length @xmath9 , solvent quality @xmath47 , strength of the electrostatic interaction @xmath48 and the charge fraction @xmath12 .",
    "all simulations are performed in dilute solution such that the interaction between the chains is small . for the system with the longest chains ( @xmath49 )",
    "we have a chain extension @xmath50 and a chain - chain separation @xmath51 which was calculated for a random packing of spheres according to      the screened renormalized monopole interaction @xmath53 between two chains can be estimated for this case to be of the order @xmath54 . for our estimate",
    "we have used a crude approximation on the debye - hckel level . the effective chain charge @xmath55 is calculated by using the counterions within a shell of @xmath56 around the polyelectrolyte to renormalize the bare charge @xmath57 .",
    "the density of the free counterions @xmath58 leads a screening constant @xmath59 and as the interaction potential we take @xmath60 . for this estimate",
    "one has to keep in mind that both the used practical definition of the effective charge as well as the screening concept can not be founded on physical principles .",
    "details about the used parameters and measurements of some basic observables for all simulated systems can be found in appendix a. we have grouped the simulations into series depending on the investigated parameters .    the chain length dependence is studied in simulation series which differ in the line charge density @xmath12 . for series a1",
    "we use a charge fraction @xmath61 , and the chain length is varied over one decade in steps of @xmath62 from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "series a2 and a3 are performed at @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 at slightly different densities .    to study the dependence on the solvent quality we have varied the short range attraction by changing the lj parameter @xmath47 between @xmath69 and @xmath70 for medium sized chains of length @xmath71 ( series b ) .",
    "the @xmath72-point for this model was determined to be at @xmath73  @xcite . for most of the other simulations (",
    "series a1 , a2 , a3 , c1 , c2 and c3 ) we used @xmath74 which is thus deep in the poor solvent regime .",
    "this value is chosen for practical reason . in this regime",
    "we have found relatively large and stable pearl - necklace conformations which are more easy to investigate .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction is studied via changing the bjerrum length @xmath48 and the charge fraction @xmath12 .",
    "we simulated chains with length @xmath75 in three series c1 , c2 and c3 with charge fractions @xmath76 , @xmath68 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "they are performed at the same charge density @xmath77 but they contain different numbers of counterions @xmath78 corresponding to the number of charges on the pes .",
    "all three series start out at @xmath79 . in",
    "series c1 @xmath48 ranges up to @xmath80 , in series c2 and c3 up to @xmath81 .",
    "in addition there is a simulation set with shorter chains @xmath82 with @xmath61 and a different solvent parameter @xmath83 which we only use for the phase diagram ( series c4 ) .",
    "here we give a detailed overview over the parameters of the simulated systems and some basic observables , namely the chain length @xmath9 , the end - to - end distance @xmath42 , the hydrodynamic radius @xmath199 , the characteristic ratios @xmath320 and @xmath98 and the osmotic coefficient @xmath321 , where @xmath322 is the pressure and @xmath323 is the ideal gas pressure . if possible , also the number of pearls @xmath143 and the average number of monomers in a pearl @xmath149 is given . in the tables  [ seriea1_tab ]  to  [ seried_tab ] @xmath42 , @xmath199 and @xmath48 are given in @xmath25 , @xmath47 in @xmath54 .",
    "all other quantities in the tables are dimensionless numbers . the statistical error for the chain extensions @xmath42 and @xmath199 is smaller than @xmath324 .",
    "@xmath149 exhibits a systematic error of @xmath140 monomers . for @xmath325",
    "the number of pearls has an accuracy of @xmath326 . for smaller @xmath149 values",
    "this error becomes larger .",
    "the statistical error of the pressure calculation gives rise to an error of the osmotic coefficient of @xmath327 resulting in a large relative error for small values of @xmath328 .",
    "in this section we define our measured observables and explain in detail how we analyzed our simulated pe conformations .",
    "especially we present the cluster recognition algorithm which we used to automatically classify different pearl - necklace structures .",
    "we denote the position of monomer @xmath89 with @xmath90 and the distance between two particles @xmath89 and @xmath91 with @xmath31 .",
    "the center of mass for the chain is then @xmath92 and the center of mass coordinates are @xmath93 . for the chain extension",
    "we use the end - to - end distance                for a first structure classification we use two characteristic ratios between the different chain extension observables .",
    "the first characteristic ratio is defined as @xmath97 .",
    "the second characteristic ratio is @xmath98 which has the advantage of being experimentally accessible  @xcite .        to describe the counterion distribution around polyelectrolytes we use an integrated counterion distribution @xmath101 .",
    "the distance @xmath102 of a counterion @xmath89 from a chain is defined as the distance of the counterion from its closest monomer in space .",
    "we denote the set of counterions belonging to one chain with @xmath103 . from this",
    "we can calculate @xmath101 as        for an automated analysis of all types of pearl - necklace structures appearing in our configurational data we need a tool to determine for each monomer , to which pearl or string it belongs , and what is the total number of such substructures .",
    "first we should state that there is no sharp definition of a pearl or a string .",
    "so what we need is a practical approach to the problem .",
    "our guideline in the development of an automated tool for the identification of pearls and strings is that the result should be close to the result which would be obtained by looking at the conformation by eye .",
    "before we give a detailed explanation of the used cluster recognition algorithm we want to present some other methods that are based on observables which could be accessible with experimental methods . in this way",
    "one can also judge how easily theses structures can be observed by current experimental techniques .",
    "the local monomer concentration @xmath106 of a chain is given by @xmath107 .",
    "to distinguish the different substructures , pearls and strings , it is better to use a coarse grained local monomer concentration @xmath108 which is defined as      where @xmath110 is a spherical volume with radius @xmath111 around @xmath112 . this observable is larger in a pearl than in a string .",
    "one can calculate @xmath108 along the backbone as a function of the monomer positions @xmath113 .",
    "this is done for a chain with length @xmath114 from series a1 whose snapshot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ana_trials]a .",

    "c ) local distances @xmath117 for @xmath118 along the backbone .",
    "d ) analysis with the cluster recognition algorithm .",
    "monomers in pearls are grey and monomers in strings black .",
    "[ fig_ana_trials ] ]    a second approach uses local distances between the monomers which could be probed by nmr experiments  @xcite . the local distance between monomer @xmath91 and the monomer @xmath119 which is @xmath120 monomers apart on the backbone",
    "is defined as      from scaling arguments one expects that the local distances inside the compact pearls scale with @xmath122 for small @xmath120 whereas in the extended strings it scales with @xmath123 . the symbol @xmath124 is used to state a scaling relation which ignores numerical prefactors . for the conformation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ana_trials]a the local distances along the backbone are shown for @xmath118 in fig .",
    "[ fig_ana_trials]c .    in both cases",
    "one can see the position of the 4 pearls and 3 strings .",
    "the problem is that the variation of both @xmath108 and @xmath117 is of the same order as the difference between the mean values in pearls and strings .    since the two previous methods have several problems with the structure recognition of pearl - necklace conformations we have developed a more reliable algorithm based on a simple cluster recognition .",
    "the question whether a group of monomers forms a cluster is often connected to a distance criterion , e.g. monomers with a distance smaller than a critical value belong to the same cluster . for a polymer one",
    "has also to take into account the chain connectivity .",
    "this implies that a pure distance criterion is not sufficient .",
    "therefore we require in addition that there are a certain number of bonds between a pair of monomers along the chain contour .",
    "the resulting algorithm is iterative and contains the following steps :    1 .   at the beginning",
    "every monomer is a cluster of size 1 ( size = number of monomers belonging to a cluster ) .",
    "two clusters @xmath125 and @xmath126 are merged if they contain a pair of monomers @xmath127 with @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "in addition @xmath89 and @xmath91 are further apart than @xmath131 bonds along the chain contour : @xmath132 .",
    "step 2 is repeated between all clusters as long as one finds clusters that have to be merged .",
    "4 .   remove loops : a cluster @xmath125 where all monomers are inside ( along the chain contour ) of another cluster @xmath126 are merged .",
    "note that this step is only suitable for polyelectrolytes , but e.g. is not applicable for polyampholytes .",
    "5 .   practical definition of pearls : all clusters with a size larger than or equal @xmath133 are pearls . pearls which are connected directly along the chain contour are merged .",
    "practical definition of strings : all clusters with a size smaller than @xmath133 belong to strings . strings which are connected directly along the chain contour are merged .",
    "remove dangling ends and merge them to the end pearls .",
    "we do this because we have so far not seen dangling ends containing more than 3 monomers which could be seen as an extra string .",
    "thus the algorithm has in principle three free parameters : @xmath111 , @xmath131 and @xmath133 . but",
    "looking at the involved structures , one can establish relations between these parameters which can be used as a rough guide in choosing them . from scaling arguments",
    "we know that the distance of two monomers @xmath89 and @xmath91 with a distance @xmath134 along the chain contour scales as @xmath135 inside the pearls and with @xmath134 inside the strings .",
    "thus we can choose @xmath136 to distinguish the two cases .",
    "for a weakly charged chain one can determine a suitable value for @xmath133 with help of the pearl size defined in eq .",
    "[ gp_scaling ] .",
    "but this is not possible for our strongly charged systems with their subtle dependence on the counterion distribution .",
    "the whole data analysis in this paper is done with an empirical parameter set : @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 . beside extended visual checks we have tested that small changes of the three parameters do not have a significant effect on the final result .",
    "the derived sizes for the substructures contain a systematic error of @xmath140 monomers coming from the two outer monomers on each side of a substructure , for which one can not decide whether they belong to the next pearl or the next string . a typical result for a structure type with 4 pearls",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ana_trials ]  d. the four pearls and three strings contain the following numbers of monomers : 90 - 8 - 94 - 6 - 77 - 9 - 98 .",
    "we do not claim that this is the fastest or the best way to identify pearl - necklace structures , but it worked well when compared with visual checks and thus served our purpose . for an average pearl size larger than 30 monomers it yields a reliability well above 95% .",
    "one of our goals in this paper is to show to what extend scaling theories that are made for long chains at infinite dilution can be expected to work for dilute pe systems with finite length at finite density .",
    "the scaling theory predicts the dependencies of observables like the chain extension on various parameters , e.g. @xmath9 , @xmath48 , @xmath12 and the reduced temperature @xmath141 .",
    "here we give only a short overview of some results of the scaling theory for the pearl - necklace regime of polyelectrolytes .",
    "for the pearl - necklace regime one finds the following relations  @xcite : end - to - end distance @xmath42 @xmath142              note that @xmath147 is independent of the solvent quality , and that our solvent quality parameter @xmath47 is proportional to the second virial coefficient of the lj potential and hence also proportional to the reduced temperature @xmath141 .",
    "the linear scaling of @xmath42 with @xmath9 is caused by the electrostatic repulsion of the chain charge and is dominated by the string length @xmath145 . due to the finite length of our systems",
    "we have to correct the scaling relation given in eq .",
    "[ pn_scaling1 ] . for small chain length , @xmath153 ,",
    "the chain conformation consists of one pearl .",
    "the size of this pearl scales as @xmath154 .",

    "we find a similar result for the number of pearls @xmath143 in the pearl - necklace regime .",

    "[ np_ndep ] .",
    "the discreteness of the pearl number @xmath143 does not play a significant role for sufficiently long chains which give rise at least to a dumbbell .",
    "then our data is in accord with the scaling relations for the quantities pearl size , string length and pearl density , namely they are constant within the statistical error .",
    "we find for the systems of series a1 with @xmath158 : @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 . as we will show later , the discreteness of the number of pearls is smeared out due to fluctuations between different structure types in a way that the average quantities can maintain their optimal values , compare also section  [ sec_fluctuations ] .      in the simulation series",
    "b we have tested the behavior of polyelectrolyte chains upon changing the solvent quality via the lennard - jones parameter @xmath47 .",
    "since the practically usable range for this parameter is small , ranging from @xmath162 to @xmath163 , it is not possible to test the scaling predictions over a large parameter range .",
    "in addition the range of @xmath47 values for which we observed pearl - necklace structures is even smaller , namely from @xmath164 to @xmath163 . for values of @xmath165 one leaves the poor solvent regime and for values @xmath166 we encounter simulational problems , e.g. kinetically frozen states .          for both observables",

    "[ rhop_elj_dep ] shows a linear dependence on @xmath47 as predicted by eq .",
    "[ rhop_scaling ] .",
    "however , a more reliable conclusion may be drawn from the scaling relation for the pearl size @xmath147 , since @xmath147 should be independent of the solvent quality ( see eq .",

    "we therefore have calculated the pearl size as @xmath172 from our simulation data and plotted it versus @xmath47 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rp_elj_dep ] @xmath147 increases monotonically with @xmath47 , hence shows an unexpected dependency on @xmath47 .",
    "we are lead therefore to conclude that the scaling predictions for the dependency on the solvent quality do not work here .",
    "they fail for the most definite test case , the independence of the pearl radius @xmath147 of the solvent quality . nevertheless in a small regime for @xmath173",
    "they seem to work approximately for some observables due to a fortuitous error cancellation .    to elucidate the role of the finite counterion density around the chains we calculated the integrated ion distribution @xmath101 ( see eq .  [ iondis ] ) .",
    "[ iondis_eljdep ] @xmath101 is shown for different solvent qualities .",
    "the counterion distribution changes greatly close to the chain with @xmath47 . in the pearl - necklace regime between @xmath174 and @xmath175 which is the same regime where we find also the strongest change in the chain extension",
    "we observe that the counterion distribution is changing the most .",
    "the fraction of counterions being very close to the chain which hence can be called condensed is also varying strongly . only the top four curves show an inflection point which is a sign of counterion condensation  @xcite ( see also sec .  [ coexistance ] ) .",
    "scaling theory assumes usually that the counterion condensation depends only on the manning parameter @xmath176 and is hence supposed to be independent of the actual conformation of the chain . note that the total series b is performed at @xmath177 and is thus expected to show no counterion condensation at all according to the standard manning - oosawa  @xcite concept which requires @xmath178 .      as we demonstrated in the previous subsection  [ subseq : solvent ] , the interplay between counterions and chain conformation influences greatly the behavior of pes in poor solvent .",
    "therefore also a thorough investigation of the parameters determining the coulomb interactions is necessary .",
    "this section treats the simulation series c1 , c2 and c3 where we have investigated the @xmath48 dependence but using different charge fractions @xmath76(c1 ) , @xmath179(c2 ) and @xmath180(c3 ) .",
    "all simulations are performed at the same charge density @xmath157 .",
    "we remark that the valences of the charged particles is yet another important independent parameter .",
    "but since this is also not included in the scaling picture and would even further complicate the picture we will leave this for another study .",
    "we will also look at the behavior of these systems with regard to parameters combined of @xmath48 and @xmath12 , namely the manning parameter @xmath181 and the scaling variable @xmath182 .",
    "the manning parameter is important for the electrostatic field that counterions would experience around a long stretched chain and its value determines in a first approximation the onset of counterion condensation . in the framework of scaling theory simulations performed at the same value of @xmath182",
    "should be identical .",
    "nevertheless our simulations show a big difference between the three series .",

    "however , our data show that this is only true if the scaling variable @xmath183 is smaller than @xmath184 .",
    "this can be seen in the inset in the upper right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig.re_lbdep ] where we plotted the same data versus @xmath182 . upon a further increase of @xmath183 the values of the end - to - end distances diverge rapidly .",

    "even though the effect of @xmath12 on the charge charge correlations may be small it is enhanced strongly by the interplay between the chain conformation and the counterion distribution .",

    "this is the same mechanism which we have already seen for the dependence on @xmath47 in the previous section .",

    "this is also reflected in a large difference of the pearl sizes and the string lengths .",

    "we will come back to the collapse discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec_pase_space ] where we will also give an overview of the occurring conformations .",
    "the data analysis shows that pearl - necklace conformations are very soft objects which display large fluctuations on all length scales . we will measure in detail the extent of the various fluctuations , since this is important for the interpretation of experimental measurements on polyelectrolyte solutions ( see section  [ sec_formfac ] )",
    "in most of our simulated systems we find coexistence of pear - necklaces with different number of pearls which we call structure types .",
    "it is important to note that the observed coexistence is not caused by frozen meta - stable states .",
    "we have excluded this possibility by observing individual chains over a larger period of time each showing a large number of transitions between different structure types during the simulation time .",

    "the chain mainly fluctuates between structures with 4 and 5 pearls , but we also see a significant fraction of structures with 3 and 6 pearls . looking at @xmath43 one can see a certain correlation with the structure type which is reflected also in the mean value for different structure types : @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 . here and in the following the superscript denotes that a observable is measured only for conformations with a certain number of pearls @xmath143 .",

    "the end - to - end distance increases with increasing pearl number : @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , hence the shorter chains have a larger effective manning charge parameter , namely @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 .    since the pes in this regime are elongated structures and they carry a large effective line charge it might be worthwhile to compare the ion distribution with predictions from poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory .",
    "this is also supported by the functional form of the integrated counterion distributions in fig .",

    "a perfect quantitative agreement can however not be expected since our system is finite , and has as such a smaller electric field , and secondly the pearl - necklace structures do alter the near electrostatic field of the chain and lead to an inhomogeneous counterion distribution . as a word of caution",
    "we remark that the bare value for the manning parameter of the chain in fig .",
    "[ id_strucdep ] is 0.5 which would not lead to any counterion condensation at all in the simple manning picture , and the functional form of an infinite rod with that charge value would simply not show any inflection point .",
    "this again demonstrates that poor solvent chains , due to the short range attraction between monomers , feature a higher effective charge density .",
    "since the poisson - boltzmann cell model can at least qualitatively explain the change in the counterion distributions a more refined version of this model seems to be necessary .",
    "a possible starting point could be to combine the pb rod and sphere geometry as has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    when more counterions are near the chain we find in terms of a charge renormalization that the effective line charge density of the chain decreases .",
    "this allows the chain to contract further which itself induces a stronger counterion attraction . again",
    "a lower effective line charge density also increases the optimal pearl size .",
    "this results in shorter chains with fewer pearls .",
    "the opposite , longer chains with more pearls , holds when the counterions move away from the chain .",
    "this lowers the difference in the free energy between the different structure types , as was suggested above .    scaling theories",
    "have predicted a collapse of the pearl - necklace structure into a globule as soon as counterion condensation starts  @xcite due to an avalanche behavior of condensing counterions that contracts the chain . in the investigated parameter range where we observe stable pearl - necklace conformations in our simulation data",
    "we did not see such a collapse transition . in the light of a recent study  @xcite",
    "this is not surprising , since it can be shown that this collapse depends on how easily the counterions can enter the globule , the ion concentration , and the strength of the electrostatic interaction .",
    "also the necessary amount of condensed counterions to induce the collapse can be quite high .",
    "we also suggest that the fluctuations due to the presence of the counterions lower the energy barrier between the different structure types .",
    "to confirm this suggestion one would need to analyze the transition frequency between the different structure types for chains with explicit counterions and a corresponding debye - hckel chain with the same @xmath143 .",
    "this is however outside the scope of the present investigations .      in this section",
    "we discuss fluctuations of the chain conformation on a smaller length scale , namely the radius of the pearls @xmath147 and the pearl - pearl distance @xmath211 .",

    "the arrows mark the mean value of the corresponding probability distribution .",
    "[ ppd_dis ] ]      as we have already seen for the overall chain extension also the size of the substructures are influenced by the counterion distribution .",
    "the pearl size is decreasing with increasing number of pearls and increasing chain extension as one can see from the arrows in fig .",
    "[ ps_ppd_dis ] .",
    "still an explanation in terms of a charge renormalization is not sufficient for an understanding .",
    "this becomes more clear when we look at the number of counterions inside a shell around the chains .",
    "rounded to integers we find for a shell radius of @xmath56 on average @xmath230 counterions .",
    "averaged separately for the different structure types we find @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 counterions for structures with @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 pearls .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the difference in this number of counterions is roughly constant for shells with radii ranging from @xmath239 up to @xmath240 and is thus independent of the exact definition of counterions called `` condensed '' to the chains .",
    "thus we now use a practical definition of an effective charge using the counterions which are closer than @xmath56 to the next monomer . for the example this yields an effective pearl charge of @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 charges for structures with @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 pearls",
    "respectively . since the pearl size is only slowly varying one gets large differences in the electrostatic self energy of the pearls of different structure types .    in the scaling",
    "ansatz the distance between neighboring pearls @xmath211 is determined by the balance between the electrostatic repulsion between the chains and the energy one needs to pull monomers out of the pearls .",
    "the second term is related to the surface tension and is roughly constant .",
    "the term connected to electrostatics is more complex .",
    "we approximate it by the electrostatic energy of two point charges carrying the average pearl charge , separated by the average pearl - pearl distance .",
    "@xmath211 ranges from @xmath245 for @xmath235-pearl structures to @xmath246 for @xmath238-pearl structures . together with the above calculated effective pearl charges",
    "we can estimate the electrostatic repulsion between neighboring pearls to be @xmath247 for @xmath235-pearl structures and @xmath248 for @xmath238-pearl structures .",
    "note that we neglect the energetic contribution of the other pearls .",
    "this difference can also not be explained by a standard debye - hckel potential since the debye screening length , calculated from the bulk charge density @xmath249 in the system , is @xmath250 and is thus much larger than the values for @xmath211 . of course ,",
    "closer to the chain the counterion density is much larger than in the bulk which could be a hint to explain the observed differences .",
    "the counterion density is rapidly varying with the distance from the chain starting with @xmath251 at a distance of @xmath252 and dropping below the bulk density at a distance of @xmath253 .",
    "the electrostatic self energy of the pearls and the electrostatic pearl - pearl repulsion show explicitly the discrepancies between a mean field approach and our simulational results .",
    "it also clearly demonstrates that it is necessary to include the counterion distribution into the model .",
    "moreover correlations between the counterions and the chain charges seem to play an important role .",
    "for instance , it can be shown that the counterions preferentially accumulate between the pearls .",
    "since the structure of polyelectrolytes in poor solvent turns out to be extremely sensitive to the inhomogeneities of the counterion distribution it should be used as a test case for the development of theoretical approaches beyond the mean field level .",
    "a more detailed discussion of these inhomogeneities can be found in ref .",
    "in order to get an overview of the parameter regimes our different simulation series are scanning through we have depicted them in a phase plot for polyelectrolytes using the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath254 as it was done for example in ref .",

    "[ phase_space1 ] .",
    "close to the lines we have put some snapshots of the configurations to get a visual impression .",
    "looking at series c3 crossing the entire @xmath48-range we find , starting on the right side at the neutral case with @xmath255 , a neutral globule .",
    "the chain is collapsed due to the poor solvent . with increasing @xmath48 the chain is getting charged , the self - energy grows ,",
    "and we can observe the rayleigh instability at @xmath256 where the globule splits into a dumbbell . at this point",
    "we find already some counterions close to the chain , hence there are condensed counterions present .",
    "further increase of @xmath48 can lead to further rayleigh instabilities , depending on the parameters . then , after reaching its maximum extension at @xmath257 the chain slowly shrinks , since the enlarged coulomb repulsion gets overcompensated by condensing counterions .",
    "finally we reach a collapsed conformation at @xmath258 .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the chain extension is qualitatively the same as in the good solvent case and qualitatively well understood  @xcite ; however , the decrease is faster and more pronounced in the poor solvent case  @xcite .",
    "scaling theories have predicted that with the onset of condensation the pearl - necklace should collapse in a first - order transition  @xcite .",
    "however we find always a smooth distribution of counterions which looks like a distribution that can be calculated within pb theory  @xcite .",
    "the counterions get pulled closer to the macroion as the coulomb coupling is increased , and a rather high bjerrum length , or similarly , a large number of condensed counterions are needed to collapse the pe to a globule .",
    "also the osmotic pressure does not show any dramatic decrease with @xmath48 , so we believe that for an adequate description of the collapse we need a refined theory .",
    "a very interesting , and as we believe , new conformational regime opens up basically for those @xmath48 values between the maximal chain extension up to the collapsed state . here",
    "we find conformations that are reminiscent of a cigar - like shape  @xcite , but turn out to look more like a sausage for longer chains .",
    "since with increasing @xmath48 more counterions are attracted towards the chain the pearl pearl repulsion is getting screened such that the pearls slowly coalesce and the conformation is not stretched on longer length scales anymore . due to its shape",
    "we have termed it the sausage regime .",
    "note that the actual conformation depends also on @xmath12 where smaller values of @xmath12 lead to thicker sausages .",

    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ phase_space2 ] this opens up a completely new plane in the phase diagram of polyelectrolytes .",
    "the three simulation series c1 , c2 and c3 all scan the entire @xmath48-range and differ only in the charge fraction @xmath12 .",
    "in mean field theories for polyelectrolytes we find two important parameters .",
    "the first one is the manning parameter @xmath259 which plays a role in all attempts to renormalize the charge of highly charged polyelectrolytes  @xcite .",
    "the second one is a measure for the overall coulombic repulsion on a charged chain @xmath183 . as a first ansatz for a scaling theory for highly charged polyelectrolytes at finite density an effective charge fraction @xmath260",
    "is often used , trying to combine both parameters . in this framework",
    "the three simulation series should behave identically .",
    "in contrast to this we find e.g. that the maximal extension @xmath261 for the three series differs strongly .",
    "namely we find for c1 @xmath262 , for c2 @xmath263 and for c3 @xmath264 .",
    "it is also striking that only the series with larger @xmath12 has a regime where the chains are stretched and they behave as if they were in a good solvent .",
    "the rayleigh instability occurs at the same value @xmath265 for all three series as expected because the counterions do not play a dominant role here .",
    "increasing @xmath48 from this point on the three series behave very differently . whereas the series with @xmath68 and @xmath76 show a cascade of rayleigh instabilities budding more pearls until they reach stretched conformations the series with @xmath61 has a dumbbell conformation at the maximum extension .",
    "the maximum extension itself is reached at different values for @xmath48 ( see fig .  [ fig.re_lbdep ] ) . for series",
    "c1 the maximum extension is probably more restricted by the chain entropy than that is determined by the interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions .",
    "the chains then slowly shrink and enter the sausage regime . still at the same value of @xmath48 the chains with @xmath76 are much longer than the chains with @xmath68 or @xmath61 . finally the collapsed conformation is reached roughly at the same value of @xmath266 . in this regime",
    "we have almost a dense electrolyte solution with mobile ions inside the chains so we should be close to the critical behavior of a coulomb fluid .",
    "this suggest that the collapse should occur at roughly the same value of the coupling parameter @xmath267 which is the interaction energy of two oppositely charged ions at contact in units of @xmath208 .    in principle",
    "the phase space for polyelectrolytes has far more than the shown three dimensions . as we know from previous studies  @xcite",
    "also the density is a very relevant parameter and would have to be included into the phase diagram .",
    "further important parameters are the valency of the counterions , and added salt concentrations which we did not investigate at all here .",

    "the form of the shown curves for @xmath105 and @xmath200 clearly indicates that it is not possible to deduce the conformation type since at each value the chain could either be in a pearl - necklace conformation or , at higher @xmath48 in a sausage like conformation .    since for the pearl - necklace regime itself @xmath200 is a monotonic function of @xmath143 we have plotted the values of @xmath200 for all simulations in this paper that we assign to this regime in fig .",

    "the reason is that even in a dilute solution there is already a delicate interplay between the counterion distribution and the chain conformation for strongly charged chains .",
    "this became in particular evident in our investigations studying the dependence on the solvent quality and the coulomb parameters @xmath48 and @xmath12 .",
    "our results challenge approaches that apply manning - like charge renormalization and simple scaling concepts to strongly charged polyelectrolytes .",
    "since we found strong effects already for dilute solutions we expect an even more complicated counterion chain coupling for semi - dilute and dense polyelectrolyte solutions .",
    "we have discussed the different types of fluctuations present for pearl - necklace structures and quantified them for our data .",
    "we showed that the free energy differences between the structure types can be very small and that the size and position of the substructures exhibit large fluctuations .    in a preliminary classification of the phase space of pes in poor",
    "solvent we have shown that the phase space is multi - dimensional and that the region for pearl - necklace structures is rather small . in this context",
    "we have also investigated the coulomb induced collapse of poor solvent pes which appears to be a rather smooth transition . there",
    "we have shown that the strong screening in the vicinity of the charged chains leads to sausage like conformations instead of pearl - necklaces .",
    "our data suggest that the collapse is determined by the bjerrum length since it occurs at @xmath318 for all systems which lead us to suggest that in the collapsed state ion - ion correlations @xmath319 play the most prominent part .",
    "finally we computed some experimentally accessible observables like the form factor and characteristic size ratios .",
    "this should help to analyze the experimental data and to discover pearl - necklace signatures which , according to our understanding , are not very pronounced .",
