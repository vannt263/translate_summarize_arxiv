    "over the last decade , wavelet systems have grown as one of the most important tools in the analysis of cosmological and astrophysical data .",
    "a lot of proposals for wavelet systems on the sphere have been advanced in the mathematical literature , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , dahlke , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "some of these attempts have been explicitly motivated by astronomy and/or cosmology ( see for instance @xcite for a review ) .",
    "in particular in the area of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data analysis , wavelets have been used for a large number of applications ( see references in the next paragraph ) .",
    "the interest for wavelets in this area is very easily understood ; predictions from cmb theory are typically cast in the fourier domain , however exact fourier analysis can not be entertained because of the presence of foreground and masked regions .",
    "the double - localization properties of wavelet systems ( in real and harmonic domain ) hence turn out to be most valuable .",
    "moreover , addressing important issues such as the possible existence of features and asymmetries in cmb maps is nearly unfeasible without ideas which are broadly related to the wavelet literature .    among spherical wavelets ,",
    "particular attention has been recently devoted to so - called needlets , which were introduced into the functional analysis literature by @xcite ; their statistical properties were first considered by @xcite .",
    "needlets enjoy several properties that make them worth of attention for cosmological data analysis .",
    "in particular , they are computationally very simple , and naturally adapted to standard packages such as healpix @xcite ; they do not require any form of tangent plane approximation , but they are naturally embedded into the manifold structure of the sphere ; they are compactly supported in the harmonic domain , i.e. they depend only on a finite number of multipoles which are explicitly known and can be controlled by the data analysts ; they are quasi - exponentially localized in real space , i.e. their tails decay faster than any polynomial ; and finally , it has been shown in @xcite that random needlet coefficients enjoy a very useful uncorrelation property : namely , for any fixed angular distance , random needlets coefficients are asymptotically uncorrelated as the frequency parameter grows larger and larger . as well - known , uncorrelation entails independence in the gaussian case : as a consequence , from the above - mentioned property it follows that needlet coefficients from a cmb map can be seen as nearly independent at high frequencies , making thus possible the introduction of a variety of statistical procedures for testing non - gaussianity , estimating the angular power spectrum , testing for asymmetries , implementing bootstrap techniques , testing for cross - correlation among cmb  and large scale structure data , and many others , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recently , the needlet construction has also been extended to the case of spin / polarization data , see for instance @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to introduce a new kind of needlets to the field of cmb analysis following an approach which has been very recently advocated in mathematics by @xcite .",
    "this approach ( which we shall discuss in section 2 ) can be labeled mexican needlets .",
    "as we shall discuss below , a special case of the mexican needlets provides at high frequencies a close approximation to the widely used spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw , see for instance @xcite ) , with some advantages in terms of their numerical implementation and the investigation of their localization and statistical properties . as such , the investigation of their properties in this case will allow to understand the stochastic properties of smhw and compare them with standard needlets .",
    "mexican needlets depend on a parameter @xmath0 , and we shall show how this parameter can be tuned to improve the localization properties in the real or in the harmonic domain .    the second purpose of this paper is to provide a practical description of properties of different needlet types important for cmb analysis",
    ". proper knowledge of the localization properties on the pixelized sphere as well as in multipole space is crucial for selecting and applying the proper type of needlet to a specific problem .",
    "although the exact mathematical properties of the needlets are well known , we have studied the properties which are of high importance for cmb analysis and which are too complicated to be easily deduced from the mathematical results . in particular , in the presence of foregrounds and masks , it is important to know their influence on the needlet coefficients .",
    "for the smhw it has been shown for several applications @xcite that an extended scale dependent mask must be used when analyzing masked data with wavelets . here",
    "we will study this in detail for the different needlet types with different parameter values .",
    "we then provide a very thorough comparison between different needlets .",
    "the previous discussion leads naturally to the issue about their optimal construction , i.e. how to devise numerical recipes which will enhance their localization properties . here",
    ", we shall compare the numerical recipe implemented by @xcite with an alternative proposal based on bernstein polynomials ( see also @xcite for a related numerical investigation ) .",
    "the latter entail weight functions with just a finite number of bounded derivatives ; to distinguish it from the previous construction we will label this procedure bernstein needlets .",
    "we stress , however , that the underlying mathematical theory presents no real novelty as compared to the results by @xcite .",
    "we then go on to provided vast numerical evidence on the various forms of localization , by means of a number of different indicators .",
    "in particular , the role of the different parameters in the determination of the various properties is fully exploited .",
    "as well - known , there is usually a trade - off between localization properties in the frequency and real domains , as a consequence of the uncertainty principle ( it is impossible for a non - zero function and its fourier transform to be simultaneously very small , see for instance @xcite ) ; the main purpose of this paper is to show how mexican and standard needlets jointly provide a flexible set of tools where each user can optimize this trade - off according to the needs of a specific data analysis problem .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : intro_on_need ] , we review the standard needlet construction , introduce mexican needlets and compare their respective properties from a mathematical point of view . in the following sections , we provide numerical evidence on the localization properties of these procedures by means of several different figures of merit ; we discuss at length the interplay among the different properties and the trade - off to face when choosing which procedure to adopt for a given astrophysical problem . in section [ sec : summary ] , we summarize the main indicators used and the properties of the different needlets measured in terms of these indicators . in the appendix , we provide some details on the numerical recipes we adopted , some short discussion on mathematical properties and analytic fits .",
    "the construction of the standard needlet system is detailed in @xcite , see also @xcite ; we sketch here a few details to fix notation and we provide in the appendix a more detailed discussion for completeness .",
    "the introduction of mexican needlets is due to @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; they are used here for the first time in the astrophysical literature , so we provide below a more complete discussion .",
    "we point out that for @xmath1 , an analogous proposal was first advocated in the astrophysical literature by @xcite .    the basic needlet function can be described in real space as follows : + @xmath2here",
    ", @xmath3 refers to a position @xmath4 on the sphere , @xmath5 are spherical harmonic functions , @xmath6 is the scale ( frequency ) of the needlet and @xmath7 is a set of _ cubature weights _ corresponding to _ the cubature points _",
    "@xmath8 for simplicity , they can be taken to be equal to the pixel areas and the pixel centres in the healpix @xcite grid used for cmb analysis , i.e. we shall consider @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of pixel in the pixelization we are working with .",
    "the needlet function itself is contained in the function @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 for short ) in harmonic space , @xmath13 being one of the parameters deciding the properties of the needlet . the difference between the needlet systems we are going to discuss can thus be traced in the form of the weight function @xmath12 .",
    "* 1 ) standard needlets * : let @xmath14 be an infinitely differentiable ( i.e. , @xmath15 function supported in @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 if @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "define @xmath21for standard needlets we then obtain @xmath12 from this function @xmath22 by @xmath23 . for a given scale @xmath6 , the needlet function in harmonic space is centered at a multipole @xmath24 .",
    "thus a given scale @xmath6 is mainly influenced by multipoles close to @xmath25 .",
    "it is immediate to verify that @xmath26 only if @xmath27 .",
    "an explicit recipe to construct a function @xmath22 with the previous features is discussed in appendix [ app : std ] ( compare @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main localization property of needlets is established in @xcite , where it is shown that for any @xmath28 there exists a constant @xmath29 s.t .",
    ", for every @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the usual distance on the sphere .",
    "more explicitly , needlets are almost exponentially localized around any cubature point , which motivates their name .    * 2 ) bernstein needlets * the bound which we just provided to establish the localization properties of needlets depends on some constants @xmath33 which we did not write down explicitly .",
    "such constants depend on the form of the function @xmath34 and turn out to be rather large in the case of standard needlets . in appendix [ app : bern ] , we give another method of construction of @xmath35 , where such function is no longer infinitely differentiable but rather has a finite number of bounded derivatives .",
    "the localization theory described in @xcite goes through without any modification , as do the stochastic properties established by @xcite .",
    "we do no longer have quasi - exponentially decaying tails , however , but it is possible to establish a weaker result , namely the decay with a polynomial rate , depending on the number of bounded derivatives we are allowing for @xmath36 it may hence seem that this construction should enjoy worse properties - but in practice this is not the case , as shown by our simulations in the sections to follow . as for standard needlets , we have @xmath23 , but note that @xmath22 is different for bernstein needlets as detailed in the appendix . as for the standard needlets ,",
    "the needlet function in harmonic space is centered at @xmath24 .    *",
    "3 ) mexican needlets * the construction in @xcite is similar to standard needlets , insofar as a combination of legendre polynomials with a smooth function is proposed ; the main difference is that for standard  needlets the kernel is taken to be compactly supported ( i.e. , depending only a finite number of multipoles @xmath37 ) , while the mexican needlet construction draws information from all frequencies at any scale .",
    "more precisely , we shall consider weight functions @xmath38 of the form + @xmath39for @xmath40 for instance , for @xmath1 the mexican needlet takes the form @xmath41 and for higher @xmath0 we have@xmath42indeed , for mathematical rigour @xmath43 should be replaced by the eigenvalue @xmath44 but for cmb data analysis the difference is negligible and we shall use @xmath43 for notational simplicity .",
    "as mentioned before , mexican needlets are not supported on a finite number of multipoles , so the discussion of their localization properties in the harmonic domain requires some care .",
    "moreover , because we need to focus on an infinite number of spherical harmonics , from a strictly mathematical point of view exact cubature and reconstruction formulae can not hold .",
    "nevertheless , it must be added that the approach by @xcite enjoys some undeniable strong points , some of which we list as follows :    \\1 ) mexican needlets enjoy extremely good localization properties in the real domain ; more precisely , at a fixed angular distance @xmath3 their tails decay as @xmath45 as @xmath6 grows to infinity .",
    "\\2 ) by adjusting the parameter @xmath0 , one has available a family of wavelets which can be optimized in terms of the desired localization properties ( as we shall show below , a growing @xmath0 improves the localization in the harmonic domain and decreases the localization in the real domain )    \\3 ) the previously mentioned mathematical issues on the cubature points are largely negligible from a numerical point of view    \\4 ) the monte carlo evidence provided below proves that mexican needlets compare favorably with standard needlets under a variety of circumstances and for many different indicators    \\5 ) analytic expressions can be provided for their high - frequency behavior in real space .    concerning the last point , it is important to remark the following .",
    "it can be shown that mexican needlets for @xmath1 provide a very close approximation of the widely popular spherical mexican hat wavelets ( smhw ) , see appendix [ app : smhwvsmex ] . even in this case , though , the implementation through needlet ideas in our view yields important benefits :    \\a ) the weight function is explicitly given , making easier the implementation and the validation of numerical codes    \\b ) the localization structure in harmonic domain can be analytically studied and controlled    \\c ) the correlation structure of random mexican needlet coefficients is explicitly given and can be used for statistical inference    \\d ) the range of scales to be considered to retain the information from the data is mathematically determined in terms of the frequencies @xmath46 rather than by an ad hoc choice of scales in the real domain as a function of angular distance .",
    "in the sequel of the paper , we shall compare three properties of these needlet constructions , namely their localization in the real domain , the localization in the harmonic domain , and the statistical properties of needlet coefficients , primarily their correlation structure .",
    "spherical needlet coefficients are defined as + @xmath47where @xmath48 is the cmb temperature field .",
    "the correlation coefficient is hence given by @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the legendre polynomial of degree @xmath37 and @xmath52 is the power spectrum of the cmb temperature field ; the last step follows from the well - known identity ( @xcite )    @xmath53 for standard needlet coefficients , it was shown by @xcite that under general conditions the following inequality holds@xmath54where @xmath55 is the standard geodesic distance on the sphere . in words , for any two points at a finite distance on the sphere the correlation between needlet coefficients centred on this points decays to zero as the frequencies grow larger and larger .",
    "of course , under gaussianity this simply implies that the coefficients become nearly independent at high frequencies . for mexican needlet coefficients ,",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let us assume that the cmb angular power spectrum behaves as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is some smooth function , for instance the ratio of two positive polynomials .",
    "clearly ( [ cmbspec ] ) provides a good approximation to cmb spectra , with spectral index @xmath58 it is then possible to show that , for @xmath0 such that @xmath59 there exist some constant @xmath60 such that @xmath61where some possible logarithmic factors have been neglected , see @xcite for details .",
    "we should note that while uncorrelation holds for standard needlets no matter what the rate of decay of the angular power spectrum , here we need @xmath62 not to be  too large  as compared to the order of the mexican needlet we are using .",
    "the intuition behind this result is the following .",
    "mexican needlets ( and similarly spherical mexican hat wavelets ) are not compactly supported in the harmonic domain ; in other words , whatever the frequency @xmath46 they are drawing information from the smallest multipoles , i.e. those most affected by cosmic variance .",
    "the faster the decay of the spectrum ( i.e. , the higher the @xmath62 ) , the greater the influence of this low frequency components on the behavior at high @xmath6 . in order to compensate for this cosmic variance effect ,",
    "it is necessary to ensure that the mexican needlet filter will go to zero fast enough in the harmonic domain .",
    "clearly , the higher the @xmath0 , the faster our wavelet will approach zero at low multipoles , thus compensating for cosmic variance effects . in practice , however , for cmb data as we mentioned before @xmath62 can be taken to be equal to @xmath63 , whence the correlation coefficient is seen to decay to zero even for the smallest @xmath1 . indeed",
    ", our numerical results below will show that for physically realistic angular power spectra mexican needlets outperform standard ones in terms of uncorrelation properties , thus providing one more possible motivation for their use on cmb data .    to close the introduction to mexican and standard needlets we present plots showing a comparison between the mexican needlets for @xmath1 and smhw ( see figures [ fig : smhw - smhn ] ) ,",
    "mexican needlets for different values of the parameter @xmath0 at different frequencies @xmath6 ( see figures [ fig : mex_diff_j_p ] ) and the weight function @xmath64 for mexican and standard needlets ( see the 2 top figures in figures [ fig : b_ells ] for comparison between mexican and standard needlets , see bottom figure in figures [ fig : b_ells ] for seeing how the mexican weight function depend on the parameter @xmath0 ) .",
    "note that for spherical mexican needlets , the needlet function in harmonic space is no more centered at @xmath24 since one no longer has a symmetric distribution around the maximum of @xmath12 , as can be seen in figures [ fig : b_ells ] . to obtain a measure of the multipole we are looking at ,",

    "for the application of the needlet transform to cmb analysis , it is crucial to know how well the needlet coefficients are localized on the sphere .",
    "this is particularly true in the presence of foreground contaminants ( diffuse galactic foregrounds or extragalactic sources ) or in cases were parts of the cmb maps have been masked .",
    "for all practical analysis one will always need to ask the questions how far away from the galactic plane are the needlet coefficients unaffected by the galaxy? , or how far away from the mask are the needlet coefficients expected to behave as if the mask were not present?.    as there is an infinite number of different needlet bases , one can not run simulations each time one changes the basis in order to infer the localization properties for this particular kind of needlet . by comparing the influence of the mask in simulations of some needlets to expected properties based of these needlet functions",
    ", it is our aim to obtain an understanding of the effect of the shape of the needlet functions to simulated cmb maps and thereby infer formulae which can be applied to a large group of needlets without the need of running new simulations each time .",
    "our main goal is to find a relation for the minimum distance from a mask where the needlet coefficients are not significantly affected by it .",
    "we perform simulations and compare the needlet coefficients with and without the presence of the mask in order to define the size of the contaminated regions .",
    "we found that the starting point for the most stable way to define the contaminated and safe regions was to construct the correlation coefficient between the masked and unmasked needlet coefficients .",

    "@xmath80 is then the correlation coefficient as a function only of the distance @xmath79 from the mask for a given scale @xmath6 .",
    "the fraction of influence from the mask at a given @xmath79 is then given by @xmath81 .",
    "we will now define the _ critical angle _ @xmath82 which is the distance from the border of the mask after which the total fraction of the influence of the mask is smaller than a certain threshold @xmath83 .",
    "thus for a threshold of @xmath84 , @xmath85 of the influence of the mask is found inside the critical angle .",

    "<S> over the last few years , needlets have emerged as a useful tool for the analysis of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data . our aim in this paper is first to introduce in the cmb literature a different form of needlets , known as mexican needlets , first discussed in the mathematical literature by geller and mayeli ( 2009a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then proceed with an extensive study of the properties of both standard and mexican needlets ; these properties depend on some parameters which can be tuned in order to optimize the performance for a given application . </S>",
    "<S> our second aim in this paper is then to give practical advice on how to adjust these parameters for wmap and planck data in order to achieve the best properties for a given problem in cmb data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we investigate localization properties in real and harmonic space and propose a recipe on how to quantify the influence of galactic and point source masks on the needlet coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that for certain parameter values , the mexican needlets provide a close approximation to the spherical mexican hat wavelets ( whence their name ) , with some advantages concerning their numerical implementation and the derivation of their statistical properties . </S>"
