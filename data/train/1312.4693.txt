    "because of the periodic boundary conditions enforced by the single valuedness of the wave function , the eigenstates of the electron in a ring look like bloch waves in a crystal , where the circumference of the ring corresponds to the lattice constant and the bloch wave number ( quasi - momentum ) in the crystal is taken up by the flux parameter @xcite .",
    "the effect of a superimposed nonuniform potential @xmath0 in the ring simulates the structure of a crystal with allowed and forbidden energy bands and gaps , among which zener transitions can be induced by the electromotive force created by a linear variation in time of the the magnetic flux @xcite .",

    "the eigenstates and corresponding energies of the hamiltonian @xmath31 are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the winding number that determines the angular momentum @xmath34 of the rotating electron .",
    "in the presence of the external potential @xmath35 , the energy spectrum and corresponding eigenfunctions of @xmath31 can be mapped into the spectrum and bloch - floquet states of the associated periodic potential @xmath36 , where the normalized magnetic flux @xmath37 plays the role of the wave number @xmath38 of the electron in the crystal @xcite . to show such an equivalence ,",
    "let us look for a solution to the eigenvalue problem @xmath39 of the form @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath41 then satisfies the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath42 with the boundary condition @xmath43 since @xmath36 , eq.(7 ) can be viewed as the stationary schrdinger equation of an electron in the periodic potential @xmath0 with lattice constant @xmath44 .",
    "according to the bloch - floquet theorem , the most general solution to eq.(7 ) is a bloch state , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath38 is the crystal wave number ( quasi - momentum ) , that varies in the interval @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the energy dispersion curve of the @xmath25-th band of the crystal , and @xmath49 is the periodic part of the bloch eigenfunction .",
    "the boundary condition ( 8) requires @xmath50 , i.e. the normalized magnetic flux @xmath37 fixes the quasi momentum @xmath38 of the electron in the lattice . the eigenfunctions and corresponding energies of the quantum - ring hamiltonian @xmath31 are thus given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "hence by tuning the normalized magnetic flux from @xmath53 to @xmath54 one can probe the entire band structure of the periodic potential @xmath0 .    for a complex potential ,",
    "we can generally write @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath0 , respectively , @xmath58 is a real parameter that determines the strength of non - hermiticity of the potential , and @xmath56 , @xmath59 are the profiles of the real and imaginary potential terms .",
    "note that @xmath5 corresponds to the ordinary hermitian problem . of particular interest is the case of a @xmath1 symmetric complex crystal , which requires @xmath60 . in this case",
    ", a critical value @xmath61 of @xmath62 does exist such that the energy spectrum of the crystal is entire real - valued for @xmath63 ( unbroken @xmath1 phase ) , whereas complex - conjugate energies appear for @xmath64 ( broken @xmath1 phase ) .",
    "the complex - conjugate energies above the symmetry breaking point emanate from the wave numbers @xmath65 or @xmath66 , i.e. at the center or at the edge of the brillouin zone @xcite .",

    "the physical implications of spectral singularities in non - hermitian systems have been highlighted in recent works , especially in connection to resonance - like behavior in scattering problems and instability thresholds in optical systems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in complex crystals spectral singularities at the @xmath1 symmetry breaking point are responsible for a secular growth in time of the wave function @xmath70 in spite of the real energy spectrum of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "mathematical implications of spectral singularities have been investigated as well @xcite , and the question whether resolution of the identity operator is possible for a hamiltonian possessing spectral singularities has been debated . to this regard , contrary to earlier indications it was rigorously proven in ref.@xcite that the contribution of the spectral singularity to the resolution of identity operator depends on the class of functions employed for physical states , and that there is no obstruction to completeness originating from a spectral singularity ( see also ref.@xcite ) . in case of a non - hermitian quantum ring considered in this paper",
    ", it should be nevertheless noticed that the spectrum of the hamiltonian is point like , and spectral singularities of the associated complex crystal are mapped into _ exceptional points _ @xcite .",
    "thus , for the quantum particle on the ring threaded by a magnetic flux with the external potential @xmath0 at @xmath71 , the eigenfunctions of @xmath31 form a complete basis for a magnetic flux @xmath37 different than either ( or both ) @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , whereas in the opposite case coalescence of pairs of eigenfunctions and eigenvectors ( corresponding to exceptional points ) are found .    as an example , let us consider the periodic potential ( 10 ) at @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath75 the energy spectrum and corresponding eigenfunctions of @xmath31 can be calculated in a closed form ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in particular , the energy spectrum turns out to be the same as that of a free particle , i.e. @xmath76 is given by eq.(6 ) .",
    "for @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 ) the eigenvalues of @xmath31 are simple ( non - degenerate ) and the corresponding eigenfunctions form a complete set . as @xmath37 approaches a value close to half an integer ,",
    "i.e. as @xmath79 , two enenergies coalesce in pairs , namely @xmath80 , and the corresponding set of eigenfunctions ceases to be complete because of the exceptional point at @xmath81 .",
    "the appearance of the exceptional point leads to a secular growth in time of an initial wave function with a defined winding number .",
    "in fact , let us expand the wave function @xmath70 on the basis of functions with defined winding number , defined by eq.(5 ) , i.e. let us set @xmath82 where @xmath83 are given by eq.(6 ) .",

    ", it should be noted that , while there is a close connection between the problem of a quantum particle on a ring and the related complex crystal problem , the evolution of a quantum wave packet in the two cases can show rather distinctive features as a result of the restricted spectrum of @xmath31 in the quantum ring problem .",
    "for example , let us consider the complex potential @xmath93 at the @xmath1 symmetry breaking point .",
    "in a complex crystal , the spectral singularities of @xmath31 are responsible for an initial growth a normalizable state ( a wave packet ) , however the wave function growth is limited because of the zero measure of the spectral singularities , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "contrary , in the quantum ring problem the growth is not clamped .",
    "the reason thereof is that the spectral singularities are transformed into exceptional points in the quantum ring problem , which belong to the point spectrum of @xmath31 .     ] and in real space [ right panels , snapshot of @xmath94 in the hermitian case ( @xmath5 ) for ( a ) @xmath95 , and ( b ) @xmath96 .",
    "the particle is initially at rest and fully delocalized in the ring , corresponding to @xmath97 .",
    "the amplitude of the external potential is @xmath98.,width=328 ]    -symmetry breaking point @xmath99 .",
    ", width=328 ]      a particularly interesting case is the one of a magnetic flux which is varied in time @xcite .",
    "when the flux @xmath100 threading the ring is linearly increased in time , i.e. @xmath101 a constant electric field ( electromotive force ) which accelerates the particle is induced in the ring according to faraday s law @xcite . since @xmath50 , a linearly - varying magnetic flux @xmath102 corresponds to a bloch electron moving at a constant speed @xmath103 in the momentum ( @xmath38 ) space .",
    "an electron in a pure bloch state will follow the flux change adiabatically if the induced electric field is infinitesimal , i.e. , it will be backscattered to the same energy band each time it reaches a zone boundary . if the field strength [ i.e. the @xmath103 parameter in eq.(15 ) ] is increased , zener tunneling between different bands can occur .",
    "for a real - valued potential @xmath0 , i.e. in the hermitian case , the general problem of zener tunneling of a quantum particle on a ring threaded by a ramped magnetic flux can be investigated rather generally by decomposing the wave function @xmath70 as a superposition of the adiabatic bloch states , namely @xmath104 , and looking for the evolution of the amplitudes @xmath105 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "zener tunneling between adjacent bands is ruled by a cascade of two - level lz tunneling events , which occur as the magnetic flux @xmath37 crosses the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "while such a method can be extended to the non - hermitian case @xcite , it has a limited validity since it fails in the presence of exceptional points .",
    "the reason thereof is that , as magnetic flux @xmath106 crosses an exceptional point , the adiabatic eigenstates of @xmath31 lack of completeness .",
    "therefore , in the non - hermitian case it is more convenient to study the quantum evolution by expanding the wave function @xmath70 on the basis of the angular momentum eigenfunctions ( 5 ) . after setting @xmath107 and @xmath108 substitution of eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) into eq.(1 ) yields the following evolution equations for the amplitudes @xmath84 @xmath109 in their present form , eqs.(18 ) can be regraded as a multi - level lz problem @xcite , where successive crossings of the bare ( diabatic ) energy levels between states @xmath25 and @xmath7 occurs at the times @xmath110 .",
    "in this section we focus our attention to the multi - level lz problem [ eqs.(18 ) ] for the specific potential given by eq.(10 ) with @xmath111 , and highlight distinct features of non - hermitian versus hermitian case .",
    "in particular , striking effects are predicted in the non - hermitian case at the @xmath1 symmetry breaking point , as discussed below .",
    "for the potential ( 10 ) , after introduction of the normalized time @xmath112 , eqs.(18 ) read @xmath113 where we have set @xmath114 and @xmath115 . note that @xmath116 in the hermitian case ( @xmath5 ) , whereas @xmath117 , @xmath118 at the @xmath1 symmetry breaking point ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the coupled equations ( 19 ) can be regarded as a generalization , to the non - hermitian case , of a multi - level lz problem @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting case is that of a shallow potential , corresponding to @xmath119 ( i.e. @xmath120 ) , and a slow increase of the magnetic flux , @xmath121 ( i.e. @xmath122 ) , with @xmath123 of the order ( or larger than ) @xmath124 . in this case",
    ", the multilevel lz problem reduces to the cascade of zener transitions between two levels @xmath25 and @xmath125 , as one can see from the energy level diagram corresponding to eqs.(19 ) and shown in fig.1(b ) . since @xmath120 ,",
    "the diabatic energies of the levels are far apart each other that transitions are not allowed , except in the neighborhood of the times @xmath126 @xmath127 , where crossing of the energies between level @xmath25 and level @xmath125 occurs [ see fig.1(b ) ] .",
    "this means that , apart from the dynamical phase term , the amplitude @xmath84 does not change in time , except for sudden changes at the two crossings times @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "for example , at @xmath130 the change of amplitudes @xmath131 and @xmath132 can be obtained by solving the two - level lz problem @xmath133 which shows a linear level crossing at @xmath134 .",
    "the scattering matrix , that relates the values of @xmath131 , @xmath132 at times @xmath135 and @xmath136 , does not depend on the winding number @xmath25 and its form can be rather generally expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , below the @xmath1 symmetry breaking point , i.e. for @xmath137 , the non - hermitian multilevel lz problem ( 19 ) can be readily mapped into the corresponding hermitian one . in fact , after introduction of the amplitudes @xmath105 by the relation @xmath138 eqs.(19 ) take the form @xmath139 where we have set @xmath140^{1/2}=s_2 [ ( 1+\\alpha)/(1-\\alpha)]^{1/2}$ ] . in their present form , eqs.(25 )",
    "describe the multilevel lz problem ( 19 ) in the hermitian case , with @xmath141 .",
    "hence the evolution for the amplitudes @xmath84 in the non - hermitian case , below the @xmath1 phase transition , can be readily obtained from the behavior @xmath105 of the associated hermitian problem after the substitution defined by eq.(24 ) .",
    "the major effect of non - hermiticity in the lz problem is the breakdown of the time reversal symmetry .",
    "this implies an asymmetric behavior of the particle motion when the sign of the magnetic flux , i.e. the direction of the magnetic field threading the ring , is reversed .",
    "in fact , let us first observe that , if @xmath142 is a solution to eq.(25 ) with a magnetic flux @xmath143 , then one has @xmath144 , i.e. reversal of the direction of the magnetic field ( and hence of the electromotive force ) in the hermitian case merely corresponds to reverse the direction of motion on the ring ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the non - hermitian case , from eq.(24 ) it follows that @xmath146 and hence : @xmath147 i.e. the invariance of the dynamics to the transformations @xmath148 , @xmath145 is broken . as an example , let us consider the dynamics of a quantum particle that is initially at rest and fully delocalized on the ring , i.e. let us assume @xmath149 . in figs.2 and 3",
    "we show the numerically - computed quantum evolution of the particle state , both in the physical and momentum space , in the hermitian ( fig.2 ) and non - hermitian ( fig.3 ) case and for two opposite values of the magnetic flux rate @xmath150 .",
    "parameter values have been chosen such that , at each lz crossing , the probability of zener tunneling from one level to the coupled one , given by @xmath151 , is close to one .",
    "hence , in the hermitian case the effect of the linearly - increasing magnetic flux is to induce a drift of the particle motion in momentum space ; the direction of the drift is reversed as the sign of the magnetic flux is flipped , as shown in fig.2 . in the non - hermitian case ,",
    "a similar behavior is observed , however the norm of the wave function is not conserved ; according to eq.(28 ) , amplification or damping of the wave function is observed , depending on the sign of @xmath150 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "more striking features can be observed in the non - hermitian case at the @xmath1 symmetry breaking point @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", the non - hermitian problem can not be mapped into the hermitian one by the transformation ( 24 ) owing to a divergence at @xmath152 , and a direct analysis of eqs.(19 ) with @xmath118 should be considered . in the limit @xmath153 , @xmath154 and",
    "@xmath155 larger than ( or of the order of ) @xmath156 , a simple analytical expression to the solution to eqs.(19 ) can be derived by an asymptotic analysis . after setting @xmath157\\ ] ] for @xmath158 one obtains    @xmath159    for @xmath160 , whereas @xmath161    for @xmath162 . in eqs.(30 ) and ( 31 ) , @xmath27 is defined by eq.(21 ) , whereas @xmath163 is the step ( heaviside ) function , i.e. @xmath164 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",
    "like in the previous case , i.e. below the @xmath1 symmetry breaking , the wave function evolution is strongly asymmetric for reversal of the magnetic flux . as an example , in fig.4 we show the numerically - computed evolution , both in real and momentum space , of the wave function corresponding to the intial particle at rest and fully delocalized on the ring , i.e. @xmath149 , for parameter values @xmath168 , @xmath152 , and for @xmath95 [ fig.4(a ) ] and @xmath96 [ fig.4(b ) ] .",
    "the behavior of the ( exact ) numerically - computed wave function evolution in momentum space clearly reproduces the predictions based on the asymptotic ( approximate ) solutions as given by eqs.(30 ) and ( 31 ) .",

    "such a counterintuitive effect can be explained on the basis of _ unidirectional _ zener tunneling between adjacent levels that enables to freeze the particle motion in momentum space after some target time @xmath175 .",

    "as briefly mentioned in sec.ii.a , possible physical systems where non - hermitian quantum rings might be in principle realized include light propagation in twisted fibers @xcite or cold atoms in rotating annular traps @xcite .",
    "however , for such systems the experimental and technological feasibility to implement a non - hermitian potential , like the one considered in the present work [ eq.(10 ) ] , remains a rather challenging task .",
    "different and experimentally more feasible physical implementations , for example based on propagation of optical pulses in recirculating fiber loops with gain and loss @xcite , should be investigated .",
    "finally , our analysis could be extended to study the dynamics of non - hermitian quantum rings including a possible imaginary vector potential in the schrdinger equation @xcite , in addition to the external potential .",
