    "the explicit derivation from first principles of the langevin equation , describing the evolution of a small number of variables in a complex system , is often necessary since in many cases the statistical properties of the random force , the range of applicability and even the form of the equation are far from evident  @xcite .",
    "the need for microscopic considerations is especially compelling in the case of a nonlinear langevin equation where the usual phenomenological approach of adding stochastic terms to the deterministic nonlinear equation describing the relaxation of targeted variables may be inadequate  @xcite .",
    "although statistical properties of the random force in the nonlinear langevin equation may be deduced phenomenologically in some cases  @xcite , it is generally necessary to start from the microscopic behavior of the system in order to construct the appropriate form of the equation .",
    "the conventional systematic method for deriving the langevin equation ( le ) for a brownian particle exploits mori s projection - operator techniques  @xcite , which allow the transformation of the microscopic liouville equation to a non - markovian predecessor of the le , generally known as the generalized langevin equation .",
    "the le can be then obtained by a subsequent perturbation expansion of the memory kernel appearing in the generalized langevin equation using the square root ratio of the mass of a bath particle to that of the brownian particle , @xmath7 , as a perturbation parameter @xmath8 .",
    "while the first step in the derivation of the le , involving rearrangement of the liouville equation with projection operator methods , is an exact algebraic procedure , the question of convergence of the @xmath8 expansion in the second step is subtle and can be strictly justified only under assumptions which are difficult to prove in general  @xcite .",
    "mazur and oppenheim developed an alternative projection - operator approach more suitable to analyse the convergence of the @xmath8 expansion  @xcite .",
    "the validity of the perturbation analysis in both the mori and the mazur - oppenheim approaches has been examined for an exactly solvable model consisting of tagged particle motion in a harmonic lattice  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the convergence properties of the @xmath8 series are trivial for this model , since all terms in the @xmath8 expansion higher than zeroth order vanish . as a result , the memory kernel for the linear damping force in the le does not depend on the mass ratio , and all non - linear terms are identically zero  @xcite .",
    "one goal of this paper is to present and analyze a simplified model that serves as a useful and non - trivial testing ground for examining some of the subtle aspects of the theory of brownian motion .",
    "the model considered here is a generalization of the well - known rayleigh model of a brownian particle of mass @xmath0 constrained to move in one dimension and subjected to collisions with an equilibrium ideal ( non - interactive ) gas of particles of mass @xmath1 .",
    "the rayleigh model is perhaps the oldest model of non - equilibrium statistical physics  @xcite , and has attracted much attention over the years , with early work  @xcite focusing on the model as a test of the systematic derivation of macroscopic kinetic equations for the heavy particle from the master equation .",
    "more recent investigations have examined the stationary and transient solutions of the asymmetric rayleigh model in which the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the gas to the left and right of the piston differ  @xcite . in all these studies ,",
    "the interaction between the brownian particle and the bath is assumed to be short - ranged with a negligible collision time @xmath9 .",
    "only binary collisions are considered in this model because the range of interaction is assumed to be short compared to the average distant between bath particles .",
    "the usual starting point for analysis of the rayleigh model with binary collisions is a markovian master equation for particle s velocity distribution function .",
    "the master equation is only an approximate form of the fully microscopic liouville equation , and valid only for time scales longer than @xmath9 . to test many aspects of the theory of brownian motion ,",
    "it is essential to start from a fully microscopic description of the dynamics directly from the liouville equation so that any non - markovian character of bath correlations is properly incorporated and particle dynamics on time scales less than @xmath9 can be described . to this end",
    ", one may generalize the interaction between the bath and brownian particles from a hard - wall to a parabolic repulsive potential .",
    "the generalized model is analytically solvable , allowing explicit calculation of all terms appearing in the derivation of both the linear and nonlinear le beyond the binary collision approximation .",
    "we demonstrate that in addition to the small parameter @xmath10 , the character of the dynamics of a tagged particle can be governed by an additional parameter , @xmath11 , involving the average number @xmath4 of bath particles simultaneously interacting with the brownian particle . for a large brownian particle",
    ", it is shown that when @xmath6 and multiple collisions are important , the parameter of the formal @xmath8-expansion is actually @xmath11 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the mazur - oppenheim approach is reviewed to provide groundwork for all subsequent analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "the structure of terms in the @xmath8 expansion is examined and presented in a convenient form . in section 4 ,",
    "the general formalism is applied to the rayleigh model with a quadratic repulsive potential describing bath - brownian particle interactions , and the le is derived for the heavy particle .",
    "the nonlinear le is obtained in section 5 and various aspects of this equation are discussed . finally , a few concluding remarks are made in section 6 .",
    "the hamiltonian for a brownian system composed of a tagged particle of mass @xmath0 in a bath of point particles of mass @xmath1 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are positions and momenta of bath particles , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are those of the brownian ( or tagged ) particle , and @xmath17 is the hamiltonian of the bath in the field of the tagged particle fixed at @xmath15 .",
    "one can expect that on average @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath20 is the temperature , and that the scaled momentum @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , is of the same order as the average momentum of a bath particle . in terms of scaled momentum , one can write the liouville operator as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the forces on the _ i_-th bath particle and on the brownian particle , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath26 dictates the dynamics of the bath in the field of the fixed brownian particle .",
    "if the mass of the tagged particle is large ( i.e. a brownian particle ) , one might intuitively expect that inertial effects of the particle s motion are small and that the force on the particle , @xmath27 , is close to the pressure force , i.e. to the force on the fixed tagged particle , @xmath28 in the mazur - oppenheim approach  @xcite , the force @xmath29 is decomposed using the projection operator @xmath30 which averages a dynamical variable @xmath31 over the canonical distribution @xmath32 , for bath variables at fixed position of the tagged particle , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the canonical partition function and @xmath35 . using the operator identity  @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one may formally decompose the force @xmath29 on the tagged particle into a `` random '' part and a remainder as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "( [ randomforce ] ) can be simplified taking into account the orthogonality of @xmath43 and @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath44 ) , and the equality @xmath45 which can be derived by integration by parts . as a result , one obtains the following exact equation of motion for the scaled momentum of the tagged particle , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a zero - centered random force obeying @xmath48 .",
    "the random force @xmath49 can be further expanded in terms of the mass ratio parameter @xmath8 using identity ( [ identity ] ) to obtain @xmath50 similarly , the kernel @xmath51 appearing in the exact equation of motion ( [ em ] ) of the tagged particle may be expanded in a power series in @xmath8 @xmath52 where the correlation functions @xmath53 are defined to be @xmath54 the truncation of the @xmath8-expansion to zeroth order , @xmath55 , leads from eq.([em ] ) directly to the generalized langevin equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 this approximation is sensible provided the correlation functions @xmath58 appearing at higher order in the @xmath8-expansion decay on a similar @xmath8-independent time scale @xmath9 characteristic of motions of the fixed - particle system ( i.e. governed by @xmath26 ) .",
    "mazur and oppenheim  @xcite succeeded in proving that this is the case assuming the factorization properties @xmath59    while being formally non - local in time , eq .",
    "( [ gle ] ) can actually be written in a form that is local in time by expanding @xmath60 around @xmath61 to obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the non - local correction terms to this approximation are of the form  @xcite @xmath64 and are therefore of higher order in @xmath8 . naturally , this analysis is pertinent only if the characteristic time @xmath9 for decay of @xmath65 does not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "the local equation ( [ tdle ] ) is applicable on arbitrary time scales and for @xmath66 assumes the form of the conventional le with a time - independent damping coefficient @xmath67 .",
    "it is then evident from ( [ tdle ] ) that the autocorrelation function of the momentum of a heavy particle decays on a time - scale @xmath68 that is much longer than the characteristic time of the bath @xmath69 .",
    "one can therefore expect the local form of the le with time - independent damping to be a good approximation for eq .",
    "( [ tdle ] ) except at short times determined by @xmath70 .",
    "it will be shown below that for homogeneous bath @xmath71 , so the next approximation for the @xmath8-expansion ( [ expand ] ) is of the form @xmath72 .",
    "the equation of motion for the momentum of the tagged particle in this case includes a non - linear damping term of third order in @xmath73 .",
    "this equation will be considered in section 5 .",
    "to examine the convergence properties of the @xmath8-expansion and other features of the projection operator derivation of the le , the structure of the correlation functions @xmath53 defined in ( [ cf ] ) which appear in the expansion of the memory function must be analyzed .",
    "although only the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are needed to obtain the nonlinear le to lowest order in @xmath8 , it is useful to know general properties of @xmath53 .    by inspection of the symmetry properties of the system ,",
    "it is immediately apparent that the correlation functions @xmath76 corresponding to odd powers of @xmath8 contain an odd number of factors @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and therefore vanish for isotropic systems .",
    "in fact , in the absence of external field , the dependence on the particle coordinate appears only through the difference @xmath79 , and it is useful to introduce new variables @xmath80 . since the vectors @xmath81 and @xmath82 have negative parity and the hamiltonian @xmath17 is invariant with respect to transformation @xmath83 , the correlation functions @xmath84 vanish .",
    "correlation functions of even orders @xmath85 do not vanish and have a rather complicated structure . for notational simplicity , we restrict the analysis to the case of one - dimensional diffusion , expecting no physical features in higher dimensions . for future development , it is convenient to define @xmath86 where @xmath87 note the property @xmath88 which holds for arbitrary time arguments when @xmath89 and @xmath90 have different parities .",
    "for example , @xmath91 and @xmath92 vanish for even @xmath93 , while @xmath94 and @xmath95 are zero for odd @xmath93 .    using the definitions above and according to eqs .",
    "( [ cf ] ) , the second order correlation function @xmath75 can be written as @xmath96 using cumulants , denoted by @xmath97 and defined via the relations , @xmath98 the function @xmath75 can be written as @xmath99 note that the zeroth order kernel @xmath100 is also a cumulant , @xmath101 .",
    "the relevance of cumulant representation for @xmath53 follows from the fact that one expects the cumulants to have similar scaling properties with respect to parameters of the system independent of their order .",
    "for example , it will be established in the next section that cumulants @xmath102 of any order are linear functions of the average number @xmath4 of particles in the interaction zone around the particle for the rayleigh model .",
    "therefore , for this model , the first two non - vanishing terms in the @xmath8-expansion ( [ expand ] ) , namely @xmath100 and @xmath103 , are both linear in @xmath4 .    consider the correlation functions @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "it is tedious , though not difficult to establish that these correlation functions are of order @xmath90 in cumulants @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath104 has the contributions which are of order @xmath106 or less in @xmath107 .",
    "first consider the terms of maximal order @xmath106 : one type of these terms are the correlation functions of the form @xmath108 where here and below time arguments have been omitted for brevity .",
    "the indices @xmath109 may take any values from the set @xmath110 provided @xmath111 for example , for @xmath112 the correlation function of maximal order in @xmath107 which contributes to @xmath75 is @xmath113 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) . for @xmath114",
    "the function @xmath115 includes contributions of the form @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and so on .",
    "all other contributions of order @xmath106 in @xmath107 can be written as products of correlation functions of lower orders which can be obtained dividing the sequences @xmath118 into groups in all possible ways without permuting functions .",
    "for example , for @xmath114 the three remaining terms are @xmath119 clearly , the terms of maximal order in cumulants corresponds to the case when all indices @xmath120 in eqs .",
    "( [ structure ] ) and ( [ condition ] ) are equal to one .",
    "then the cumulant expansion of all such terms contains the contribution @xmath121 which contains @xmath90 factors @xmath122 and , therefore , is of order @xmath123 in cumulants .",
    "however , all terms of order @xmath106 in @xmath107 described above enter in @xmath104 via combinations @xmath124 which is a consequence of a presence of the operator @xmath125 ( first from the left ) in the definition of @xmath126 ( see eq .",
    "( [ cf ] ) ) . as a result ,",
    "the contributions ( [ max ] ) involving @xmath123 cumulant factors cancel , and the maximal order in cumulants of surviving terms in the expression for @xmath104 contain at most @xmath90 cumulant factors .    having established that the contributions to @xmath104 from terms of maximal order @xmath106 in @xmath107 are of order @xmath90 in cumulants , it is clear that the terms of order @xmath123 and lower in @xmath107 can not contain more that @xmath90 cumulant factors since such terms contain at least one isolated factor of @xmath127 whose average vanishes .",
    "hence @xmath104 contains _ at most _",
    "@xmath90 cumulant factors .    in the next section",
    ", we examine the consequences of the cumulant expansions of the memory function for a specific system , namely , the rayleigh model with a repulsive parabolic potential .",
    "it will be demonstrated that for the rayleigh model , cumulants are linear functions of the average number @xmath4 of particles in the interaction zone around the particle .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the terms in the @xmath8-expansion behave as @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "clearly , for a large particle and/or long - ranged potential leading to @xmath6 , these results suggest that @xmath130 , demonstrating that the actual parameter of @xmath8-expansion for this exactly solvable model is in fact @xmath11 . on the other hand , for a short - ranged potential , when @xmath5 , all terms in the expansion are linear in @xmath4 , and one sees that @xmath131 , and the effective small parameter of @xmath8-expansion is in fact the square - root of the mass ratio . to further illustrate this analysis , the explicit form of the cumulant expansion of @xmath132",

    "we assume that the temperature is low enough ( or @xmath138 is sufficiently large ) so that the probability for a particle to reach the piston s surface is negligible .",
