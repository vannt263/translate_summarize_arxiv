    "we present a new search for this decay , which improves on the previous limit by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the data were collected with the k-.07em loe  detector at d-.07em a@xmath2ne , the frascati .",
    "d-.07em a@xmath2ne  is an  collider that operates at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath19 , the mass of the @xmath20  meson .",
    "positron and electron beams of equal energy collide at an angle of @xmath21 , producing @xmath20  mesons with a small momentum in the horizontal plane : @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath20  mesons decay @xmath23 of the time into nearly collinear @xmath24  pairs . because @xmath25 , the kaon pair is in an antisymmetric state , so that the final state is always .",
    "the contamination from   and  final states is negligible .",
    "therefore , the detection of a  signals the presence of a  of known momentum and direction , independently of its decay mode .",
    "this technique is called  _ tagging_. the sample analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of @xmath26 , yielding @xmath27 billion  pairs .        the k-.07em loe  detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kloedetector ] ) consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc ) , surrounded by a lead / scintillating - fiber sampling calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "a superconducting coil surrounding the calorimeter provides a @xmath28 magnetic field .",
    "the drift chamber  @xcite is @xmath29 in diameter and @xmath30 long .",
    "the chamber shell is made of carbon - fiber / epoxy composite , and the gas used is a @xmath18 helium , @xmath31 isobutane mixture .",
    "these features maximize transparency to photons and reduce @xmath32regeneration and multiple scattering .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath33 , and the @xmath34  invariant mass is reconstructed with a resolution of @xmath35 .",

    "the arrival times of particles and the three - dimensional positions of the energy deposits are determined from the signals at the two ends .",
    "the read - out granularity is @xmath37 ; fired `` cells '' close in space and time are grouped into a `` calorimeter cluster '' . for each cluster ,",
    "the energy @xmath38 is the sum of the cell energies , and the time @xmath39 and the position @xmath40 are calculated as energy - weighted averages over the fired cells .",
    "the energy and time resolutions are @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the trigger  @xcite used for this analysis requires two local energy deposits above a threshold of @xmath43 in the barrel and @xmath44 in the endcaps .",
    "the trigger has a large time spread with respect to the beam crossing time .",

    "changes in the machine operation and background conditions are simulated on a run - by - run basis .",
    "the beam energies and the crossing angle are obtained from the analysis of bhabha scattering events with @xmath48 polar angle above 45 degrees .",
    "the average value of the center - of - mass energy is evaluated with a precision of @xmath49 for each @xmath50 of integrated luminosity .",
    "to study the background rejection , a mc sample of @xmath20  decays to all possible final states has been used , equivalent to an integrated luminosity of @xmath51 .",

    "requiring @xmath62 we selected @xmath63 million -tagged events ( @xmath59  events in the following ) , which are used as a starting sample for the @xmath0  search .    as a first step of the signal search , we select events with tracks of opposite charge having point of closest approach to the origin within a cylinder @xmath64 in radius and @xmath65 in length along the beam line .",

    "these requirements ensure a redundant determination of the event-@xmath47 and allow us to evaluate the time of flight ( tof ) for each particle .",
    "the two - track invariant mass evaluated in the hypothesis of electron mass , @xmath73 , is used to reject the dominant background due to @xmath34 .",
    "we require @xmath74 , thus removing most of @xmath75 events which peak at @xmath76 , with a resolution of @xmath77 . in order to reject tracks with a larger uncertainty on the fit parameters ,",

    "a @xmath34  event can have such a high value of @xmath73 either because one track is badly reconstructed ( @xmath81  component in the following ) or because one pion decays to a muon before entering the dc and the vertex is reconstructed from a pion and a muon track ( @xmath82  component hereafter ) . a @xmath80  event ( @xmath83  component in the following )",
    "can satisfy the  tagging criteria from the presence of a machine background cluster ( fake @xmath59 ) . at this stage of the analysis ,",

    "the reliability of mc prediction is checked comparing with data after each step of the analysis . for this purpose ,",
    "the @xmath73 interval is divided into a signal region , around the kaon mass peak , and two sidebands : @xmath86 @xmath81  and @xmath82  background sources largely dominate on @xmath83  component in region 1 , the opposite occurring in region 3 . a scale factor for the @xmath83  component , @xmath87 ,",

    "we obtain : @xmath88 which has to be compared with a data / mc luminosity scale factor of @xmath89 .",
    "the observed discrepancy is well understood , being due to the fact that mc underestimates the rate of fake @xmath59  from machine background .",
