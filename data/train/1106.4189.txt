    "the geometric dual , @xmath1 , of an embedded graph @xmath2 is a fundamental construction in graph theory and appears in many places throughout mathematics . motivated by various new constructions in knot theory , s.  chmutov , in @xcite , introduced the concept of the partial dual of an embedded graph .",
    "roughly speaking , a partial dual is obtained by forming the geometric dual with respect to only a subset of edges of an embedded graph ( a formal definition is given subsection  [ ss.pddef ] ) .",
    "partial duality appears to be a fundamental operation on embedded graphs and , although it has only recently been introduced , it has found a number of applications in graph theory , topology , and physics ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "while geometric duality always preserves the surface in which a graph is embedded , this is not the case for the more general partial duality .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 is a plane graph , then @xmath1 is also a plane graph , but a partial dual @xmath3 of @xmath2 need not be plane . partially dual embedded graphs can have different topological and graph theoretical properties .    rather than being concerned with the ways in which a graph and its partial dual can differ , here we are interested in how partial duality both preserves and transforms the structure of an embedded graph . in particular , we determine the extent to which partial duality preserves the following classical connection between eulerian and bipartite plane graphs .    [ t.intro1 ] let @xmath2 be a plane graph , then @xmath2 is eulerian if and only if its dual , @xmath4 , is bipartite .",
    "this theorem is well - known ( see , for example , theorem  34.4 of @xcite or example  10.2.10 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is known to hold more generally for binary matroids ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) , but it does not hold for non - plane graphs ( although the geometric dual of a bipartite graph is always eulerian ) . note that since @xmath5 , the words bipartite and eulerian can be in interchanged in theorem  [ t.intro1 ] .",
    "here we give the extension of this classical connection between eulerian and bipartite graphs from geometric duality to partial duality .",
    "we prove :    [ t.intro2 ] let @xmath2 be a plane graph and @xmath6 . then :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 is bipartite if and only if the components of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are eulerian ; 2 .",
    "@xmath3 is eulerian if and only if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are bipartite .",
    "this result appears in section  [ s.bepd ] as theorem  [ t.pde ] .",
    "its proof requires much more work than the case for geometric duality stated in theorem  [ t.intro1 ] . to prove the result we introduce a new way of obtaining the underlying abstract graph of partial dual @xmath3 ( see theorem  [ t.newpds ] below ) .",
    "the advantage of this construction is that it avoids having to construct the embedded graph @xmath3 itself .",
    "having established the relation between eulerian and bipartite partial duals , we then turn our attention to the problem of determining which subsets of edges in a graph give rise to bipartite and eulerian partial duals .",
    "that is , given a plane graph @xmath2 , the problem is to characterize the subsets @xmath6 having the property that @xmath3 is bipartite or eulerian .",
    "it turns out that this problem is intimately related to oriented circuits in the medial graph @xmath9 of @xmath2 .",
    "we provide the following complete characterization of edge sets that lead to bipartite partial duals :    let @xmath2 be a plane graph",
    ". then the partial dual @xmath3 is bipartite if and only if @xmath10 is the set of @xmath11-edges arising from an all - crossing direction of @xmath9 .",
    "the terminology for this theorem , together with its proof , appears in section  [ s.med ] .",
    "( figure  [ f.m ] offers a quick indication of the terminology ) .",
    "we note that theorem  [ t.intro2 ] is used in an essential way to prove this characterization .",
    "we also find a sufficient condition for a set of edges to give rise to an eulerian partial dual in terms of circuits in medial graphs ( see corollary  [ c.deu ] ) .",
    "some connections of our results with knot theory are discussed in remark  [ r.knots ] .",
    "we begin with a brief review of embedded graphs and ribbon graphs .",
    "note that we will be concerned with both cellularly and non - cellularly embedded graphs .",
    "an _ embedded graph _",
    "@xmath12 is a graph drawn on a surface @xmath13 in such a way that edges only intersect at their ends .",
    "the arcwise - connected components of @xmath14 are called the _ regions _ of @xmath2 .",
    "if each of the regions of an embedded graph @xmath2 is homeomorphic to a disc we say that @xmath2 is a _ cellularly embedded graph _ , and its regions are called _ faces_. a _ plane graph _ is a graph that is cellularly embedded in the sphere ( rather than the plane ) .",
    "two embedded graphs , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are said to be _ equal _ if there is a homeomorphism from @xmath13 to @xmath17 that sends @xmath2 to @xmath18 .",
    "as is common , we will often abuse notation and identify an embedded graph with its equivalence class under equality",
    ".    we will need to work with cellularly embedded graphs which arise as subgraphs of cellularly embedded graphs .",
    "accordingly , we will often find it convenient and natural to describe embedded graphs as ribbon graphs .    a _ ribbon graph _",
    "@xmath19 is a ( possibly non - orientable ) surface with boundary represented as the union of two sets of topological discs : a set @xmath20 of _ vertices _ , and a set of _ edges _",
    "@xmath21 such that    1 .",
    "the vertices and edges intersect in disjoint line segments ; 2 .",
    "each such line segment lies on the boundary of precisely one vertex and precisely one edge ; 3 .",
    "every edge contains exactly two such line segments .",
    "it is well known and easily seen that ribbon graphs are equivalent to cellularly embedded graphs . intuitively , if @xmath2 is a cellularly embedded graph , a ribbon graph representation results from taking a small neighbourhood of @xmath2 .",
    "neighbourhoods of vertices of @xmath2 form the vertices of the ribbon graph , and neighbourhoods of the edges of @xmath2 form the edges of the ribbon graph . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath2 is a ribbon graph , we simply sew discs into each boundary component of the ribbon graph to get a graph cellularly embedded in a surface",
    ". since ribbon graphs and cellularly embedded graphs are equivalent we can , and will , move freely between them .",
    "two ribbon graphs are considered to be equal if their corresponding embedded graphs are equal .",
    "this means that two ribbon graphs are equal if there is a homeomorphisms between their underlying surfaces that preserve the vertex - edge structure .",
    "again , at times we abuse notation and identify a ribbon graph with its equivalence class under equality .    just as with graphs , if @xmath2 is a ribbon graph and @xmath6 , then @xmath22 is the ribbon graph obtained from @xmath2 by deleting all of the edges in @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath22 is also a ribbon graph and therefore describes a cellularly embedded graph .",
    "it is this closure of the set of ribbon graphs under deletion of edges that makes them useful here ; note that deleting edges in a cellularly embedded graph may result in a non - cellularly embedded graph .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath2 is a ribbon graph and @xmath6 , then @xmath23 denotes the ribbon subgraph of @xmath2 induced by @xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _ , its edge set is @xmath10 and its vertex set consists of all vertices of @xmath2 which are incident to an edge in @xmath10 . if @xmath2 is a cellularly embedded graph then @xmath23 is defined to be the cellularly embedded graph corresponding to this ribbon graph .",
    "we will need to be able to delete edges from a ribbon graph without losing any information about the position of the edge .",
    "we will do this by recording the position of the edge using labelled arrows .",
    "an _ arrow - marked ribbon graph _ consists of a ribbon graph equipped with a collection of coloured arrows , called _ marking arrows _",
    ", on the boundaries of its vertices .",
    "the marking arrows are such that no marking arrow meets an edge of the ribbon graph , and there are exactly two marking arrows of each colour .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     furthermore , since the vertices of @xmath9 correspond to edges of @xmath2 , each all - crossing direction of @xmath9 gives rise to a @xmath24-labelling of the edges of @xmath2 .",
    "we call the edges of @xmath2 which correspond to @xmath11-vertices of @xmath9 _",
    "@xmath11-edges _ , and we call the edges of @xmath2 which correspond to @xmath25-vertices of @xmath9 _ @xmath25-edges_. ( see figure  [ f.m4 ] . )    we will need the following observation .",
    "[ p.cd ] let @xmath2 be a plane graph , then @xmath26 is a @xmath11-edge in @xmath2 if and only if @xmath27 is a @xmath25-edge in @xmath1 .",
    "the result follows by observing that the medial graphs @xmath9 and @xmath28 are equal and that the canonical face @xmath29-colouring of @xmath28 is obtained from that of @xmath9 by switching the colour of each face .",
    "we now state and prove our second main result , which is a characterization of bipartite partial duals in terms of medial graphs .",
    "[ t.bipmed ] let @xmath2 be a plane graph .",
    "then the partial dual @xmath3 is bipartite if and only if @xmath10 is the set of @xmath11-edges arising from an all - crossing direction of @xmath9 .",
    "we will deduce the theorem from the following lemmas .     of graph @xmath2.,height=151 ]",
    "[ l.bm1 ] let @xmath2 be a plane graph and let @xmath30 be a set of @xmath11-edges of @xmath2 arising from an all - crossing direction of @xmath9 .",
    "then each component of @xmath31 and of @xmath32 is eulerian .",
    "consider a vertex @xmath33 of @xmath2 , with half - edges @xmath34 adjacent to it .",
    "this vertex @xmath33 corresponds to a face @xmath35 of @xmath36 , bounded by edges of @xmath36 joined by ( not necessarily distinct ) vertices @xmath37 corresponding to the half - edges @xmath34 of @xmath2 .",
    "let us take a position on the edge @xmath38 of @xmath36 , and then walk around the face @xmath35 until we return to our starting point .",
    "we note that because @xmath36 has an all - crossing direction , each edge will be directed , and we start our walk in this given direction .",
    "we walk until we meet our first vertex , which without loss of generality we may take to be @xmath39 .",
    "this vertex has a label , either @xmath11 or @xmath25 .",
    "let us assume that it is a @xmath11-vertex ; see figure [ walk ] .",
    "when we cross @xmath39 and continue walking on to the next half - edge @xmath40 we will walk against the given direction of @xmath40 . in order for us to get back to where we started , the edges along which we walk will have to change direction in total an even number of times .",
    "therefore there must be an even number of @xmath11-vertices around the face @xmath35 , and so @xmath33 is adjacent to an even number of @xmath11-half - edges .",
    "now let us assume that the first vertex we meet @xmath39 is a @xmath25-vertex .",
    "when we cross this vertex the next edge of @xmath36 will be directed compatibly with the direction in which we are walking .",
    "so we keep walking until we meet a @xmath11-vertex , and then the previous argument applies .",
    "if we do not encounter any @xmath11-vertices then all the half - edges adjacent to the vertex @xmath33 are labelled @xmath25 .",
    "since a graph is eulerian if and only if each of its vertices is of even degree , it follows that each component of @xmath31 is eulerian .",
    "also , it follows from proposition [ p.cd ] that each component of @xmath32 is eulerian .",
    "( in fact it is not difficult to show the equivalent property that any cycle of @xmath2 contains an even number of @xmath25-edges . )    [ l.bm2 ] given a @xmath24-colouring of the edges of a plane graph @xmath2 , with the set of @xmath11-edges denoted @xmath10 , if each component of @xmath7 is eulerian and each component of @xmath41 is eulerian , then the @xmath24-colouring arises from an all - crossing direction of @xmath9 .",
    "the graph @xmath2 is plane , so it is connected and equipped with an embedding @xmath42 .",
    "this induces an embedding @xmath43 , which we also denote @xmath44 ( so that @xmath45 is the standard immersion ) .",
    "now take @xmath46 , and denote the resulting graph by @xmath47 .",
    "we first show that the regions of @xmath47 must be either discs or annuli , by arguing that no two components of @xmath41 can lie in the same region of @xmath48 .",
    "consider a region @xmath35 of @xmath48 , drawn in @xmath2 .",
    "if it is a region of @xmath2 , then it is a disc .",
    "if it is not a region of @xmath2 , then it contains other edges and vertices of @xmath2 , all the edges being marked @xmath25 .",
    "these edges and vertices divide @xmath35 into regions of @xmath2 . but @xmath2 is connected , so we can walk between any two of these regions via other such regions .",
    "therefore , the part of @xmath41 lying in @xmath35 must be connected , as required .    in @xmath49",
    ", this means that ay any separating vertex of @xmath49 exactly two blocks meet .",
    "we can also see that @xmath49 is bipartite , as follows .",
    "each component of the ( disjoint ) graphs @xmath7 and @xmath41 is eulerian , and so each vertex of @xmath47 has even degree .",
    "hence each region of @xmath49 has an even number of edges .",
    "any cycle in @xmath49 can be formed by adding boundaries of regions mod @xmath29 .",
    "hence the result .",
    "note next that because we will be switching between directed graphs and their duals it is natural to consider not only the usual `` longitudinal '' direction along an edge , but also a `` transverse '' direction .",
    "now choose a block @xmath50 of @xmath49 .",
    "it is bipartite , and has no cut vertices .",
    "choose an arbitrary transverse direction on an edge @xmath51 in @xmath50 , and use this to determine a clockwise and anti - clockwise orientation of the vertex at each of the ends of @xmath51 .",
    "( see figure  [ f.w4 ] . )",
    "any other vertex in @xmath50 will be clockwise if it is an even distance from a clockwise vertex , and anti - clockwise otherwise .",
    "this is consistent",
    "because @xmath50 is bipartite , and so it has no odd cycles .",
    "next , back in @xmath49 , let @xmath52 be a separating vertex of @xmath50 .",
    "( if @xmath50 has no separating vertex , then @xmath53 and we skip this step . ) by our observation above , there is a next block : call it @xmath54 and orient it as in figure  [ f.w2 ] . proceed in this way until all the edges of @xmath49 have been given a direction .",
    "finally , transfer this direction back to the edges of @xmath47 .",
    "this in turn induces a direction for the edges of @xmath2 , mixed , in the sense that the @xmath25 edges are directed transversely .",
    "the vertices of the medial graph @xmath36 inherit their @xmath11 or @xmath25 status from the edges of @xmath2 , and around each vertex the edges have now been directed as in figure  [ c d vertices ] .",
    "we have to check that as we move from one vertex of @xmath36 to another along an edge , the directions are consistent . to see this",
    ", note that for any two edges in @xmath2 which share both a vertex and a region , our direction must give one of the four situations in figure [ 4sits ] , or their opposite orientations .",
    "so the local directions around each vertex of @xmath36 do arise from a global direction of the edges of @xmath36 , and we thus have an all - crossing direction , as required .",
    "[ blocks ]        by combining lemmas  [ l.bm1 ] and [ l.bm2 ] , we have that each component of @xmath7 and of @xmath41 is eulerian if and only if @xmath10 is the set @xmath11-edges of @xmath2 arising from an all - crossing direction of @xmath9 .",
    "the result then follows by theorem  [ t.pde ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be a plane graph .",
    "then @xmath2 has at most @xmath55 bipartite partial duals .",
    "@xmath9 admits @xmath56 all - crossing directions , each direction giving rise to a bipartite partial dual by theorem  [ t.bipmed ] .",
    "however , reversing the direction of each edge in an all - crossing direction of @xmath9 does not change the @xmath24-colouring of @xmath2 , accounting for the ` @xmath57 ' in the exponent",
    ". there may be a further reduction in the number of bipartite partial duals , as each @xmath24-colouring of @xmath2 need not result in a distinct partial dual of @xmath2 .",
    "the following corollary of theorem  [ t.bipmed ] provides a way of constructing some , but not all , of the eulerian partial duals of a plane graph .",
    "[ c.deu ] let @xmath2 be a plane graph .",
    "if @xmath10 is the set of @xmath25-edges arising from an all - crossing direction of @xmath9 , then @xmath3 is eulerian .    since @xmath10 is the set of @xmath25-edges of @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath58 is the set of @xmath11-edges of @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath59 by theorem  [ t.bipmed ] , @xmath60 is bipartite , and , since the geometric dual of any bipartite graph is eulerian ( see remark  [ r.btoe ] ) , @xmath61 is eulerian as required .",
    "we note that the converse of corollary  [ c.deu ] is false and that determining exactly which subsets of edges of a plane graph give rise to eulerian partial duals remains an open problem .",
    "[ r.btoe ] the proof that the dual of a bipartite embedded graph is eulerian is almost identical to the well - known proof of the special case for plane graphs : let @xmath2 be a bipartite graph , then every closed walk in @xmath2 is of even length ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "therefore every closed walk about a face in any embedding of @xmath2 is of even length , and it follows that @xmath1 is eulerian .",

    "bipartite embedded graphs arise as the seifert graphs of an oriented link diagram , and these embedded graphs are necessarily partial duals of plane graphs .",
    "this provides a link between the graph theory presented in section  [ s.med ] and knot theory .",
    "in fact , our knot theoretic results from @xcite on the characterization of seifert graphs suggested the formulation and proof of theorem  [ t.bipmed ] to us .",
    "furthermore , the connection between the tait graph and seifert graph of a link diagram that was also studied in @xcite , led the authors to conjecture that @xmath62^{{\\oast}}$ ] and @xmath3 are isomorphic as abstract ( but not necessarily embedded ) graphs , which appears as theorem  [ t.newpds ] below .",
    "the results presented here therefore further illustrate the deep and fruitful connections between knot theory and graph theory .",
