    "<S> the occurrence at low temperatures of an ultrasharp field - induced transition in phase separated manganites is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results show that magnetization and specific heat step - like transitions below 5 k are correlated with an abrupt change of the sample temperature , which happens at a certain critical field . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature rise , a magnetocaloric effect , is interpreted as produced by the released energy at the transition point , and is the key to understand the existence of the abrupt field - induced transition . </S>",
    "<S> a qualitative analysis of the results suggests the existence of a critical growing rate of the ferromagnetic phase , beyond which an avalanche effect is triggered .    </S>",
    "<S> mixed valent manganites show a great deal of fascinating properties , arising from the strong interplay between spin , charge , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most intriguing one is the existence of a phase separated state , the simultaneous coexistence of submicrometer ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic and charge ordered ( co ) insulating regions dagotto . </S>",
    "<S> the phase separation scenario has its origin in the unusual proximity of the free energies of these very distinct fm and co states , and in the fact that the competition between both phases is resolved in mesoscopic length scales , giving rise to real space inhomogeneities in the material .    </S>",
    "<S> yet another surprising result more recently found in manganites is the appearance of ultrasharp magnetization steps at low temperatures ( below @xmath0 5 k ) in the isothermal magnetization @xmath1(@xmath2 ) curves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , the field induced transition of the entire compound from one phase to the other of the coexisting states , is included in the category of metamagnetic transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike the broad continuous transitions expected for inhomogeneous granular systems , in this case it occurs in an extremely narrow window of magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> these ultrasharp steps were observed in both single crystals and polycrystalline samples , indicating that it is not related to a particular micro - structure of the material .    the actual existence of a phase separated state was recognized as a key parameter for the observation of these magnetization jumps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect was first reported in manganites doped at the mn site , and the disorder in the spin lattice was thought to play a relevant role hebert1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a similar behavior was also found in pr@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath5 , and the qualitative interpretation of the phenomenon shifted to the martensitic character of the phase separated state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> accommodation strains were shown to be relevant in the stabilization of phase separation @xcite , but their role in the magnetization steps is not clear , since it is expected that grain boundaries would act as a sort of firewall  for the movement of the domain walls , stopping the avalanche process . additionally , despite its intrinsic first - order character , the martensitic transformation is spread over a large range of the external parameter driving the transition , the magnetic field in the present case , in strong disagreement with the abrupt character of the transition .    the aim of this investigations is to address a basic question concerning this abrupt field - induced transition : why is this metamagnetic transition so sharp , and what is actually causing it ? </S>",
    "<S> we report the occurrence of ultrasharp magnetization steps at low temperatures in a prototype phase separated manganite , which are accompanied by discontinuities in the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat . concomitantly with these facts </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the field - induced transition is accompanied by a large increase in the temperature of the sample , by dozens of degrees . </S>",
    "<S> this feature suggests a mechanism in which the abrupt first order transition in the whole sample is triggered by the released heat in a microscopic phase transformation . </S>",
    "<S> a low temperature heat controlled magnetization avalanche was previously found in bulk disordered magnets @xcite due to the heat released by the fm domain wall motion during the reversal of the remnant magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> also , local heating induced by non - uniform current flow was proposed as the origin of the mesoscopic fluctuations between coexisting phases observed in la@xmath6pr@xmath7ca@xmath8mno@xmath5@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that in phase separated manganites the interplay between the growth of the fm phase induced by the magnetic field and the heat generated by this growth is the key to explain the avalanche process leading to an ultrasharp field - induced transition in these inhomogeneous strongly correlated systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the particular compound under study is a high quality polycrystalline sample of la@xmath6pr@xmath7ca@xmath8mno@xmath5 , synthesized by the sol - gel technique . </S>",
    "<S> it belongs to the well known family of compounds la@xmath9pr@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath12 whose tendency to form inhomogeneous structures in the range 0.3@xmath130.4 is extensively documented . </S>",

    "<S> is lowered the sample changes from a paramagnetic to a charge - ordered antiferromagnetic state at @xmath16 = 220 k. just below , a small kink at 190 k is a signature of the onset of the formation of ferromagnetic clusters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more robust ferromagnetic phase appears at @xmath17 = 70 k ( 90 k on warming ) , which coexists with the majority co state in an inhomogeneous phase separated state @xcite . in a temperature window extending from @xmath17 down to a temperature @xmath18 @xmath19 20 k the magnetization shows considerable relaxation effects , as shown in the inset of fig . </S>",

    "<S> the magnetic state below @xmath18 is highly dependent on the sample magnetic field and cooling history . </S>",
    "<S> if the sample is cooled without an applied field ( zfc ) the magnetization at 2 k shows a significant low value , that remains unchanged while warming until @xmath18 , above with it shows a continuous increase and merges with the field cooling warming curve .     </S>",

    "<S> the following experiment was performed : with the sample placed in a vacuum calorimeter with a weak thermal link to the temperature controlled surroundings ( kept at 2.5 k ) , the sample s temperature was measured while the magnetic field was increased , with field increments identical to the data of fig.2 . the obtained result , plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , shows the occurrence of a sudden and huge increase of the sample s temperature , greater than 25 k , at the same critical field of the magnetization jump . </S>",
    "<S> since the relaxation time for temperature stabilization between the sample and the temperature controlled surroundings ( of the order of several seconds ) is much larger than the internal time constant between the sample and the sample holder ( of the order of milliseconds ) , the temperature rise measured is intrinsic to the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the abrupt increase of the sample s temperature can be then doubtless ascribed to the heat generated when the non - fm fraction of the material is converted to the fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> the same experiment was repeated with samples of la@xmath23pr@xmath24ca@xmath11mno@xmath5 with different pr content , as well as in samples of the series landcamno . whenever a magnetization jump occurs a sizable increase of the sample s temperature </S>",
    "<S> was observed . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth mentioned that in the @xmath1(@xmath2 ) and @xmath22(@xmath2 ) data of figure 2 the sample s temperature is in fact not strictly constant ; there is also a sudden temperature rise at the field of the step transition , followed by a quick relaxation to the base temperature of system .    the process which starts with nearly the whole material in the non - fm phase at @xmath25 = 2.5 k and ends with a nearly homogeneous fm state at @xmath26 @xmath27 30 k , is conceptually related with the magnetocaloric ( mc ) effect @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> 30 k at @xmath21 @xmath19 2.2 t. the inset shows a spontaneous magnetization jump , measured with a fixed magnetic field.,width=226 ]    the mc effect consists basically in a temperature change @xmath28 induced by the application of a magnetic field , which , within the approximation of reversible process , is related with the entropy change @xmath29 generated by ordering the spin lattice . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , however , the approximation of reversible adiabatic process is not valid , due to the strong irreversible character of the field - induced transformation . </S>",
    "<S> also , as the phase transition from de co to the fm phases involves large changes in the magnetic , structural and electronic properties , which are strongly correlated , the magnetic field affects all the degrees of freedom of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this fact makes inapplicable some of the usual basic equations employed in the description of the mc effect . </S>",
    "<S> a more realistic approach is to use the conservation of the internal energy during the fast conversion process ( hypothesis of adiabaticity ) . neglecting small changes of the sample volume </S>",
    "<S> , we can make the identity @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the internal energy per volume unit . replacing the whole ( irreversible ) process by an isothermal plus an isobaric one </S>",
    "<S> , we can write : @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the specific heat of the fm phase at constant pressure . </S>",
    "<S> this yields an estimate for the released heat at the field induced transition given by @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimated value was obtained from specific heat measurements as a function of temperature performed at zero magnetic field after the sample was transformed to the fm phase by application of a field of 9 @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization and specific heat results , shown in fig . 2 , </S>",
    "<S> are macroscopic signatures of a phenomenon which must be understood at a microscopic level . </S>",
    "<S> below the temperature @xmath18 the sample gets into a strongly blocked regime , in which the fm clusters can not grow against the co background ( see inset of fig 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> after zero- field - cooling , the sample reaches the blocked state with a small , time independent , fraction @xmath35  of fm phase , which can be thought as distributed in isolated regions or clusters surrounded by a co matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the application of an external magnetic field @xmath2 weakens this frozen - in state , inducing the increase of each cluster of volume @xmath36 in an amount @xmath37 , which can depend on @xmath38 , @xmath15 , @xmath2 and time . </S>",
    "<S> the released heat yielded by this particular process is @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> part of this energy is used to locally increase the temperature of the fm volume @xmath36 , a process that can be considered as instantaneous , taking into account that the thermal conductivity of the fm phase is much greater than that of the co phase . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining energy @xmath40 is evacuated through the surrounding co region . </S>",
    "<S> this balance yields    @xmath41    once a process involving a change of the local fm fraction happens , the further evolution of the system is determined by the interplay between the rates at which the system is generating heat , and the rate at which the co phase is releasing it . when the former is greater than the latter , a local temperature rise within the fm region is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> if this temperature reaches values beyond the blocking temperature corresponding to the applied field @xmath2 the system becomes critical , in the sense that the adjacent co regions , which in turn will increase their local temperature too , become highly unstable . </S>",
    "<S> these unstable co regions are now easily transformed to the fm state , releasing heat , and so on , inducing an avalanche - like chain reaction . at the end , </S>",
    "<S> all regions which have ferromagnetism as its equilibrium state at @xmath15=@xmath26 and field @xmath2 had been converted from co to fm . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium fractions of the coexisting phases at that @xmath15 and @xmath2 values then determine the size of the avalanche process .    </S>",
    "<S> following equation ( 2 ) , we can make an estimation of the critical value of the volume change @xmath42  which is needed to _ turn - on _ the avalanche process . </S>",
    "<S> the first condition to be accomplished is that the temperature of the local fm region increases beyond the blocking temperature @xmath18(@xmath2 ) . assuming that it occurs in a time scale @xmath43 , and that in this scale the heat transferred to the co region is negligible , we obtain    @xmath44    where @xmath45 8 k at @xmath46 = 2.2 t was estimated from zfc magnetization measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation yields @xmath47 , i.e. , almost one per cent increase of the local fm volume is needed to initiate the abrupt transition . </S>",
    "<S> this condition must be accompanied by another one , related with the time @xmath43 in which the volume enlargement occurs . as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , this time has to be short enough to avoid the heat be released through the surrounding co region , i.e. , the condition @xmath48  must hold , where @xmath49 is the area of the cluster surface , @xmath50 is the thermal conductivity of the co phase and @xmath51 is a local spatial coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> a crude estimation of @xmath43 can be done assuming that , within the adjacent co region , the temperature decays from @xmath52 to @xmath25 in a length @xmath53 , and taking into account that typical low temperature values for @xmath50 could range between 0.1 - 1 w/(mk ) . </S>",
    "<S> these assumptions give , for instance , @xmath5410@xmath55 - 10@xmath56 s for clusters of volume @xmath36 = ( 50 nm)@xmath57 , and predicts a critical rate @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we estimate that thermal processes that happen within a narrow time window , involving a one percent increase of the local fm regions are needed to initiate the abrupt field - induced transition , the critical rate scaling as the linear size of the fm cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of the step transition is then governed by the probability of such an event , once the magnetic field has yielded the crossover between the free energies of the coexisting phases . one way to modify </S>",
    "<S> the avalanche probability is allowing the system to relax before reaching the critical state . allowing relaxation an increase of the fm fraction as a function of the elapsed time occurs , and consequently the value of the @xmath59  needed to _ turn - on _ the process should also increases </S>",
    "<S> this would be reflected on the dependence with the elapsed time of the critical field @xmath21 at which the jump occurs . to verify this hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the time dependence of the magnetization during a field sweep , @xmath1(@xmath2,@xmath60 ) at 2.5 k , starting with @xmath2 = 1.9 t , and waiting a time @xmath61 at fixed @xmath2 before changing to the next field value . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show the @xmath1 vs @xmath60 curves obtained for different values of @xmath62 , confirming the above presumption : for larger @xmath62 the magnetization jump occurs at higher critical fields . as a remarkable result , we observed that in most cases the step transition occurs spontaneously within the time interval where the field was unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this fact signs unambiguously that the width of the step transition , beyond any experimental resolution , is strictly zero . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows a spontaneous ( as opposed to field - induced ) magnetization jump , which happens at a fixed field and temperature values . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of spontaneous magnetization jumps in phase separated manganites was also reported by another group.spontaneous     = 7.5 ( squares ) , 15 ( circles ) , 30 ( up triangles ) and 60 min . </S>",
    "<S> ( down triangles ) , at @xmath15 = 2.5 k. the inset shows an enlarged portion of the region just before the magnetization jump.,width=321 ]    the fact that the step transition can be reached spontaneously while the external parameters ( @xmath2 and @xmath15 ) are kept constant indicates that the abrupt transition is truly connected with the probability of occurrence of certain microscopic process , which within the above described scenario is a particular enlargement of the fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , this process will initiate the avalanche only when the local increment of the fm phase is large and fast enough to yield the appropriate increase of the local temperature through a magnetocaloric effect . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 and its inset clearly show that not any enlargement process is able to trigger the step transition . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation effects displayed by the system before the occurrence of the magnetization jump indicate that the system can in fact increase its fm phase fraction without initiating the avalanche , i.e. , there are fm regions that starts to become unblocked for field values just below the critical field , increasing their local volume by overcoming energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the curve for @xmath62 = 60 min . </S>",
    "<S> ( with @xmath21 = 2.56 t ) shows a sizable increase of the fm fraction before the occurrence of the magnetization jump . from inspection of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , it is likely that for larger values of @xmath62 larger values of the fm fraction before the jump would be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the waiting time @xmath62 is a key parameter to determine the energy barriers values for which the system is blocked . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , for an extremely large value of @xmath62 the whole system would behave as unblocked and the @xmath1(@xmath2 ) curve obtained in this hypothetical situation would display a continuous metamagnetic transition behavior , without jumps . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , once the value of the minimal @xmath21 corresponding to the fastest experiment is established , the limit temperature above which the step transition no longer occurs is determined by the blocking temperature corresponding to this field , @xmath18(@xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests why the magnetization jump occurs only below a very specific temperature , mahendiran above which the system overcomes the energy barriers without turning on the avalanche process .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented evidence that the low temperature abrupt field - induced transition occurring in phase separated manganites is intimately related with the sudden increase of the sample temperature at the first order transition point , a feature which is crucial for the understanding of the phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we proposed a simple model in which the close interplay between the local increase of the fm phase and the heat released in this microscopic transformation can turn - on the avalanche leading to the observed step - like transition . within this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the entity which is propagated is heat , not magnetic domain walls , so the roles of grain boundaries in ceramic samples or strains which exist between the coexisting phases are less relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of spontaneous transitions gives additional support to that view , demonstrating that the step transition is not only the result of a crossover between macroscopic free energies induced by the magnetic field , but must be triggered by a microscopic mechanism which initiates the avalanche process . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we have established that a critical relative increment of a fm region or cluster is needed for the system to reach the `` chain reaction '' state , i.e. , larger initial fm factions require larger critical fields to _ turn - on _ the process , a feature previously observed . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite finally , it must be emphasized that the basic condition for the occurrence of the abrupt transition is that the system must reach the low temperature regime in a strongly blocked state . at temperatures </S>",
    "<S> just a few degrees higher the abrupt step - like transition no longer occurs , and it is replaced by a standard continuous metamagnetic transition @xcite . in summary , we propose that some microscopic mechanism promotes locally a fm volume increase , which yield a local temperature rise , and triggers the observed avalanche process .    </S>",
