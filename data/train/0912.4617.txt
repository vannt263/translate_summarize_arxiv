    ", the local coherence decays asymptotically while the entanglement of an entangled two - qubit system may disappear for a finite time during the dynamics evolution .",
    "the nonsmooth finite - time disappearance of entanglement is called entanglement sudden death  ( esd ) .",
    "more recently , the esd phenomenon has been observed in the laboratory by two groups @xcite .",
    "one the other hand , the long - lived entanglement in cavity qed or solid state systems was investigated by several authors @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have discussed the effects of the classical noise on entanglement dynamics and pointed out that there is long - lived entanglement in the presence of global dephasing noise .",
    "the influence of white noise on the entanglement dynamics of two atoms within two cavities has been investigated by xu and li @xcite .",
    "they found out that if only one atom is driven by the white - noise field , then there is long - lived entanglement .",
    "the entanglement dynamics in two effective two - level trapped ions interacting with a laser field has been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by dajka , mierzejewski , and luczka that there is long - lived entanglement of some composite systems even if coupled with a thermal bath @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that phase - damped cavity can lead to long - lived entanglement in a quantum system consisting of a single - cooper - pair box irradiated by a quantized field @xcite .    in the present paper , we investigate the entanglement dynamics and coherence of a quantum system formed by two two - level atoms within two spatially separated and dissipative cavities in the dispersive limit by the employing concurrence and linear entropy , respectively .",
    "the two atoms are initially entangled and the cavities are initially prepared in coherent states .",
    "we show that the esd phenomenon appears in the present system and the entanglement of two atoms decreases with the time in the short - term",
    ". however , the long - term behavior is very different since a long survival of the entanglement is shown in the system . in other words , there is long - lived entanglement ( stationary state entanglement ) in the presence of the dissipation of cavities , implying that the initial entanglement of two atoms could be partially preserved even they are put into dissipative cavities .",
    "we find the long - lived entanglement depends on the initial state of the two atoms and the ratio of the decay rate of the cavities to the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "finally , we discuss the coherence of the two atoms using the linear entropy .",
    "our results show that the linear entropy of each atom at any time is equal to the initial linear entropy , that is , the coherence of each atom is preserved .",

    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we obtain an explicit analytical solution of one atom interacting with a dissipative cavity in the dispersive limit . in section iii , we consider a quantum system consisting of two atoms within two spatially separated cavities . in section iv , the entanglement dynamics and coherence of the two two - level atoms are investigated by employing the concurrence and linear entropy , respectively .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section v.",
    "we first consider a quantum system consisting of a two - level atom interacting with a single - mode cavity . under the electric dipole and rotating wave approximation",

    "this interaction causes the losses in the cavity which is presented by the superoperator @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the decay constant . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we confine our consideration in the case of zero temperature cavity .",
    "then , the master equation that governs the dynamics of the system can be written as follows @xmath18+\\mathcal{d}\\rho ^{\\prime }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -i[v,\\rho ^{\\prime } ] + k(2a\\rho ^{\\prime } a^{\\dag}-a^{\\dag } a\\rho ^{\\prime } -\\rho ^{\\prime } a^{\\dag}a)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -i[v,\\rho ^{\\prime } ] + k(2\\mathcal{m}\\rho ^{\\prime } -\\mathcal{r}\\rho ^{\\prime } -\\mathcal{l}\\rho ^{\\prime } ) ,   \\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath19 is the density matrix of the atom - field system and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are defined by @xmath23 here the superoperators @xmath24 , and @xmath25 represent the action of creation and annihilation operators on an operator @xmath26    we can express the density matrix in the following form @xmath27where @xmath28 s are defined as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",

    "the parameter @xmath63 is 1 for pure sates and 0 for completely mixed states .",
    "it is worth noting that the ewl states belong to the class of the ` x ' states .",
    "explicitly , if the density matrix of a quantum state is of the form @xmath64 then it belongs to the class of the x states .",
    "the ewl states have the following advantages .",
    "first , we can easily find that if the initial state of two atoms is x structure , then the reduced density matrix at arbitrary time t is still x structure under the single atom evolution determined by the master equation ( 4 ) ( in the basis @xmath65 ) .",
    "second , the ewl states allow us to clearly show the influence of the purity and the amount of entanglement of the initial states on the entanglement dynamics of two atoms simultaneously .",
    "the purity of the ewl states are dependent on the parameter @xmath63 and the amount of the entanglement of the ewl states are related to @xmath60 and @xmath61 . if @xmath66 the ewl states reduce to the bell - like states @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in the case of @xmath69",
    "the ewl states become the bell states while in the case of @xmath70 they are the maximally mixed states .",
    "third , as we will see , it is easy for us to calculate the entanglement dynamics of two atoms which are initially prepared in ewl states .",
    "in this section , we will analyze the entanglement dynamics and coherence of two atoms by employing the concurrence and linear entropy , respectively . in order to study the entanglement of above system described by density matrix @xmath71",
    ", we adopt the measure concurrence which is defined by wootters1998 @xmath72where the @xmath73 ( @xmath56 ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues in decreasing order of the magnitude of the spin - flipped \" density matrix operator @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the pauli y matrix , i.e. , @xmath76 . particularly , for x structure states defined by eq .",
    "( 17 ) , it is easy to find the concurrence is    @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) , are @xmath79inserting the initial state of two atoms of eq.(16 ) into the above equations leads to @xmath80we find the concurrence @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the same if the parameter @xmath60 and @xmath61 of @xmath83 and @xmath78 are equal , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the entanglement of the two atoms depends on the initial state of the them , i.e. , @xmath84 relies on the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .    in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , the concurrence @xmath84 is plotted as a function of the dimensionless scaled time @xmath85 and the parameter @xmath86 for different values of @xmath63 . from these two figures , one can easily find that the entanglement of the two atoms suddenly goes to zero and stays zero for a finite time , i.e. , the esd phenomenon appears in the present system .",
    "however , the entanglement can not revive completely due to the dissipation of the cavity fields .",
    "the lower panels of fig.2 and fig.3 are the contour plots of the concurrence , where the severe shading areas indicating the two atoms are completely disentangled . comparing the upper panels of fig.2 and fig.3",
    ", one can clearly see that the entanglement dynamics relies heavily on the purity of the initial state which is represented by the parameter @xmath63 . for instance , the maximal value of concurrence in fig.2 is about @xmath87 while the maximal value of concurrence in fig.3 is only about @xmath88 .",
    "the contour plots of these figures clearly show that the areas showing entanglement significantly decrease with the decrease of the purity of the initial state . to show this",
    "more intuitively , we plot the concurrence as a function of the dimensionless scaled time @xmath85 for several values of @xmath63 in fig.4 . also , the entanglement dynamics depends on the initial state of the field @xmath89 as one can see from the upper panel of fig.5 .",
    "the concurrence decreases with the increase of the amplitude of @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , there is no esd .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath94 or @xmath95 , the esd phenomenon could appear .    in order to see the time limits ( long - term ) behavior of the entanglement we plot the concurrence as a function of",
    "the dimensionless scaled time @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) for @xmath93 ( solid line ) , @xmath94 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath95 ( dotted line ) in the lower panel of fig.5 . from this figure",
    ", we see that the entanglement of the two atoms survives for a long time if the mean photon number of the fields @xmath98 has small values ( see the solid and dashed lines of fig.5 ) .",
    "the entanglement of the stationary state @xmath99 depends on the initial state of the two atoms and the ratio of the decay rate of two cavities to the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "if the initial state is completely mixed ( @xmath70 ) , that is , the two atoms are disentangled initially , then no entanglement will be generated in the system .    in fig.6",
    ", we have presented the time - evolution of entanglement as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "one can see clearly that the entanglement decreases gradually as @xmath100 increases for a given time . in principle , by using the explicit expression of the concurrence , one can find exactly the threshold value after which a long - lived entanglement can be obtained .",
    "it is easy to see that the oscillations of the concurrence gradually disappears as the time @xmath100 increases . actually , from eq.(21 )",
    "one can see that @xmath102 ( @xmath103 is a constant ) leading to the following condition : @xmath104 which can be obtained from the following equation(we set @xmath105 ) @xmath106then , the entanglement has no chance to be oscillating when @xmath100 exceeds a threshold value @xmath107 ( from fig .",
    "6 , @xmath108 . here",
    "we should point out that the effective threshold value of the decay time corresponding to the transition of the entanglement from oscillating regime to fully constant value is independent of the interaction time . from the above discussions",
    ", one can observe that the initial entanglement of the two atoms could be partially preserved in the present system which is useful for quantum information processing and quantum memory .    in order to show the dependence of the long time behavior of the entanglement of the atoms on the parameter @xmath109 and the purity of the initial state @xmath63 , we plot the concurrence as a function of @xmath109 and @xmath63 with @xmath110 in fig.7 . from fig.7 , we observe that the stationary state entanglement of the atoms decreases with the increase of the parameter @xmath109 while increases with the purity of the initial state @xmath63 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the previous discussions .",
    "we have also carefully investigated the entanglement dynamics of the system if only one cavity is subjected to decay radiation field and find that the entanglement will also be partially preserved .",
    "now , we investigate the coherence of the atoms by employing the linear entropy defined by @xcite @xmath111.\\]]the linear entropy @xmath112 is zero for pure states and 1 for completely mixed states .",
    "tracing out the degrees of the freedom of the second atom from eq .",

    "( 15 ) , we get the reduced density matrix of atom 1 @xmath113|e\\rangle \\langle e|   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + [ \\rho _ { 33}(0)+\\rho _ { 44}(0)]|g\\rangle \\langle g|.\\end{aligned}\\]]thus the linear entropy of atom 1 is @xmath114=2|\\mu \\nu |^{2}>0.\\ ] ] similarly , for atom 2 , we have @xmath115=2|\\mu \\nu |^{2}>0.\\ ] ] from the above equations , we find that the coherence of the atoms is preserved in the present model , that is , the subspace of the atoms are decoherence - free subspaces @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated the entanglement dynamics and coherence of a quantum system formed by two two - level atoms interacting with two spatially separated and dissipative cavities in the dispersive limit . with the help of superoperator method , we obtained an explicit expression of the reduced density matrix of the two atoms and calculated the entanglement and coherence of them by employing the concurrence and linear entropy , respectively . in a short - term regime ,",
    "the esd phenomenon could be obtained and the entanglement of the two atoms decreases with the time development . however , in the long - term , the entanglement of the two atoms tends to a fixed value .",
    "this value depends only on the initial state of the two atoms , the atom - field coupling constant , and the decay rate of fields .",
    "particularly , we found that there is long - lived entanglement ( or stationary state entanglement ) in the presence of the dissipation of the fields .",
    "in other words , in the dispersive limit , the initial entanglement of the two atoms within two dissipative cavities could be partially preserved for a long time .    finally , we calculated the coherence of the two atoms using the linear entropy .",
