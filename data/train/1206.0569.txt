    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the iron pnictides @xcite the unusual electronic properties of this class of materials has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "the interest was stimulated by the fact that the new superconductors share several similarities with the well - studied , but still not well understood , high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "firstly , both classes of superconductors crystallize into a layered structure . secondly ,",
    "in most cases the parent compounds of the pnictides are not superconducting , and superconductivity emerges only under doping or pressure and is associated with the suppression of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order .",
    "however , in contrast to the cuprates whose parent compounds are mott insulators , the parent compounds of the pnictides are multiband metals .",
    "the nature of the magnetic ground state of the parent compounds is also different : in the cuprates it corresponds to a nel - type order of a mott - hubbard insulator , while in the pnictides magnetism is associated with a nesting - induced spin density wave@xcite ( sdw ) .",
    "the magnetic properties of pnictide materials show anomalous behavior even in the paramagnetic state .",
    "an unusual linear temperature increase of the uniform magnetic susceptibility was reported in the parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite as well as in stoichiometric and fluorine - doped lafeaso@xcite .",
    "it is now well established that the linear increase of the magnetic susceptibility with temperature is a general property of all pnictide superconductors for temperatures above the sdw transition .",
    "nevertheless , no consensus has been reached so far about the origin of this phenomenon .",
    "to date several mechanisms were proposed to explain the observed @xmath2-dependence in the pnictides .",
    "wang _ et al._@xcite and zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite suggested that the linear-@xmath2 behavior is a consequence of strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations present above the sdw transition temperature .",
    "_ @xcite argued that short - range antiferromagnetic fluctuations are the source of a linear-@xmath2 term in the susceptibility of a two - dimensional fermi liquid which allowed them to obtain good agreement with experimental data .",
    "a very important issue concerning the spectral and magnetic properties of the pnictides is the role of coulomb correlations .",
    "it is now generally accepted that electronic correlations in the pnictides are not as strong as in the cuprates and should be classified as moderate@xcite .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the spectral properties of the pnictides can be reproduced by first - principles techniques only if local dynamical coulomb correlations are taken into account .",
    "this can be achieved by employing the lda+dmft method@xcite .",
    "this computational scheme combines electronic band structure calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) with many - body physics incorporated in the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite .    in our earlier study@xcite we proposed an explanation of the temperature increase of the magnetic susceptibility of lafeaso which was based on a first - principles analysis of the low - energy spectral properties caused by local dynamical coulomb correlations , without taking into account interatomic magnetic fluctuations .",
    "in the present paper we employ the lda+dmft scheme to demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can be applied also to understand the origin of the linear temperature dependence of the uniform magnetic susceptibility in stoichiometric bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the lda+dmft computational scheme implemented in the present work proceeds in four steps : ( i ) the construction of an effective tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath3 from a converged lda solution by projecting@xcite onto wannier functions , ( ii ) the addition of the local coulomb interaction @xmath4 , ( iii ) a double - counting correction which takes into account the local interactions already decribed by the lda , and ( iv ) the self - consistent solution of the dmft equations on the matsubara contour with continuous - time quantum monte - carlo@xcite ( ct - qmc ) as impurity solver .",
    "the hamiltonian to be solved by dmft is given by @xmath5 exact investigations of the magnetic response of this model must employ a rotationally invariant form of the interaction term @xmath4 .",
    "however , up to now there do not exist effective algorithms for the solution of a five - orbital hubbard model with the full coulomb interaction within ct - qmc .",
    "furthermore , our investigation of the magnetic properties of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 requires a separate , and extremely time - consuming , _ self - consistent _ dmft calculation for each point of the susceptibility curve . to make computations feasible ,",
    "we therefore include only the density - density contributions to the full interaction @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the coulomb interaction matrix , @xmath8 is the occupation number operator for @xmath9 electrons in the orbital @xmath10 or @xmath11 , with spin @xmath12 or @xmath13 , on the @xmath14th site .",
    "this approximation neglects spin flip and pair hopping processes .",
    "nevertheless , as will be shown below , it is able to provide correct results for the spectral and magnetic properties of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the double - counting term is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the total , self - consistently determined number of @xmath9 electrons obtained within lda+dmft , and @xmath17 is the average coulomb parameter for the @xmath9 shell .",
    "we construct wannier functions in the energy window including fe-@xmath9 and as-@xmath18 states .",
    "hence , by construction energy bands of the @xmath19 hamiltonian exactly reproduce 16 fe-@xmath9 and as-@xmath18 bands ( two as and fe atoms in the formula unit , one formula unit in the unit cell ) obtained in lda calculations , and the @xmath20 hybridization is explicitly taken into account",
