    "understanding the structure of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon constituents ( partons ) , in particular how quarks and gluons provide the binding and spin of the nucleon , is one of the outstanding problems in particle physics .",
    "moments of parton distribution functions , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are benchmark calculations in lattice qcd . to compare the lattice results with experiment",
    ", one must extrapolate the data from the lowest calculated quark mass to the physical value .",
    "up to now , most results are for quark masses of about the strange quark mass and larger .",
    "a naive , linear extrapolation of @xmath1 in the quark mass overestimates the experimental number by @xmath3 40%  @xcite .",
    "while most results are for quenched qcd , where one might expect that @xmath1 is larger than the experimental value , recent unquenched results  @xcite indicate that this problem remains .",
    "it has been argued that a linear extrapolation must fail because it omits non - analytic structure associated with chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "indeed , chiral perturbation theory  @xcite suggests a large deviation of @xmath1 and @xmath4 from linearity as the pion ( quark ) mass tends to zero : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a phenomenological parameter .",
    "equation ( 1 ) fits both the lattice data and the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath6 is not yet determined by the lattice data . to constrain this parameter , and to perform an accurate extrapolation based solely on lattice results , data at smaller quark masses are crucial .",
    "to narrow the gap between the ` chiral ' regime and the lowest calculated quark mass , we have started simulations at quark masses corresponding to about twice the physical pion mass . the calculations are done for wilson fermions in the quenched approximation . improved wilson fermions are known to suffer from exceptional configurations , which would forbid such a calculation at currently accessible couplings .",
    "we work at @xmath7 .",
    "our present data sample consists of :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath8 and @xmath9 lattices are from our previous runs  @xcite . on all our lattices @xmath10 , so that finite volume effects may be expected to be small .",
    "we did not see any at @xmath11 .",
    "we are currently increasing our statistics at the smaller quark masses .",
    "we first looked at the chiral behavior of pion , @xmath12 and nucleon masses .",
    "we did not find compelling evidence for non - analytic behavior in any of the three cases . in fig",
    ".  1 we plot the nucleon mass as a function of the pion mass",
    ". quenched chiral perturbation theory ( qcpt ) predicts  @xcite @xmath13 with @xmath14 empirically one finds , to a very high precision , @xmath15 which is an analytic function in the quark mass . in fig .  1 we fit ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) to the data .",
    "both fits are hardly distinguishable in the range of the data .",
    "fit ( 3 ) gives @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath18 comes out positive instead of negative as it should , according to qcpt .",
    "there is some preference for the single parameter analytic fit ( 5 ) , which gives @xmath19 .",
    "what comes as a surprise is that the resulting physical nucleon masses ( denoted by open circles in fig .  1 ) still differ by more than 10 % .",
    "we conclude that pion masses of 300 mev are not small enough to sufficiently constrain the fit function , so as to give unambiguous results .",
    "let us now turn to the moments of non - singlet , unpolarized and polarized structure functions .",
    "we consider @xmath20 first . on the lattice",
    "one does not compute @xmath20 directly but  @xcite @xmath21 which can be interpreted as the fraction of the proton s mass carried by the @xmath22 quark minus that carried by the @xmath23 quark . because chiral perturbation theory does not provide much guidance at present quark masses , we seek a phenomenological extrapolation . in fig .",
    "2 we plot @xmath24 as a function of the pion mass .",
    "the data points have been properly renormalized and converted to renormalization group invariant ( rgi ) numbers following  @xcite .",
    "we find that the data lie precisely on a straight line , all the way from @xmath25 down to our smallest pion mass at @xmath26 .",
    "the slope comes out to be @xmath27 , which is close to the value @xmath28 expected in the heavy quark limit .",
    "a linear extrapolation to the physical pion mass , @xmath29 , gives a value for @xmath30 that is much closer to the experimental number than previous results .",
    "a fit of ( 1 ) to @xmath20 still does not constrain @xmath6 .",
    "we find @xmath31 .",
    "our present data can not distinguish between the fit function ( 1 ) and @xmath32 .",
    "let us now consider @xmath4 , the axial vector coupling of the nucleon .",
    "this quantity describes the fraction of the proton s spin carried by the @xmath22 quark minus that carried by the @xmath23 quark . in fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath4 as a function of the pion mass . again",
    ", the data lie on a straight line , and we do not see any sign of non - analytic behavior as suggested by ( 2 ) .",
    "it appears that at pion masses of 300 mev we are not yet sensitive to the predictions of chiral perturbation theory . whether the situation will improve on finer lattices has to be seen .",
