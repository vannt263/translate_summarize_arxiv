    "noninteracting bosons collectively condense into the single - particle state of lowest energy , forming a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "fermions , on the other hand , obey the pauli exclusion principle , which limits the occupation of single - particle states to a maximum of one fermion .",
    "therefore , fermions fill the lowest energy single - particle states from bottom up and form a fermi sea . when placed in a periodic lattice potential with @xmath0 sites , the wavefunction of the bec can be written as the product@xcite @xmath1 of identical coherent states @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mean occupation per lattice site , and @xmath4 the bosonic creation operator at site @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",

    "coherent quench dynamics was experimentally studied by preparing an atomic bec in a shallow optical lattice and taking it out of equilibrium by a sudden quench to a deep lattice@xcite .",
    "the rapid suppression of tunnelling and the enhanced interactions between the atoms gave rise to characteristic collapses and revivals of the bosonic matter wave interference pattern , whose periodicity is determined by the strength of the on - site interaction @xmath14 . in homogeneous lattice potentials , this phenomenon can be understood from the dynamics of a single lattice site : the time evolution of the many - body state is governed by the operator @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the on - site interaction term of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , where @xmath17 counts the number of bosons at site @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the dynamics of the entire system , @xmath18 , is comprised of a product of identical dynamics at each lattice site .    in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with the dynamics of a delocalised many - body state of fermions for which , even in a homogeneous lattice , an effective single - site description is not possible .",
    "specifically , we consider a shallow optical lattice that is simultaneously loaded with a metallic state of spin - polarised fermionic atoms and an atomic bec , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a .",
    "initially , the interactions between fermions and bosons are weak , while the large kinetic energy dominates .",
    "therefore , we approximate the quantum state of this hybrid fermi - bose system by the direct product @xmath19 .",
    "when the system is quenched by a rapid increase of lattice depth , tunnelling between lattice sites is suppressed both for fermions and bosons and interparticle interactions dominate .",
    "interactions among the bosonic component give rise to typical collapse and revival dynamics that has been analysed previously@xcite .",
    "it is the key finding of the present work that the fermionic component also undergoes coherent dynamics .",
    "although the fermions do not interact among themselves , their interaction with the bosons drives the dynamics of the quenched metallic state .",
    "similar to the purely bosonic case , the time evolution operator @xmath20 factorises into @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the on - site interaction term of the fermi - bose hubbard hamiltonian@xcite , where @xmath23 counts the number of fermions at site @xmath5 and @xmath24 is the on - site fermi - bose interaction energy .",
    "however , due to its delocalised nature , the initial metallic state @xmath25 does not factorise into a product of on - site wavefunctions .",
    "this is crucial for coherent fermionic dynamics to occur , the time scale of which is given by @xmath26 .",
    "we discuss the role of fermionic and bosonic number fluctuations in the quench dynamics and introduce the visibility of the fermionic momentum distribution as a suitable observable . in the experiment , we study the dynamics for various strengths of the fermi - bose interaction and reveal their spectral properties through fourier analyses . as a result of fermionic quantum statistics ,",

    "the on - site interactions between fermions and bosons , @xmath27 , drive coherent dynamics in the fermionic momentum distribution .",
    "the origin of the dynamics is illustrated by considering three sample cases in a two - site system .",
    "if the system features a localised fermion ( left ) or bosonic fock states with an equal number of bosons on each site ( middle ) , no dynamics occurs .",

    "the fermionic filling is chosen to be @xmath32 and stays constant as a function of time ( black point at @xmath33 ) . ]",
    "in order to illustrate the emergence of coherent quench dynamics , we consider an elementary setup with two lattice sites@xcite ( labeled 1 and 2 , spaced by distance @xmath34 ) , occupied by a single fermion and multiple bosons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) . for finite tunnelling and vanishing interactions , @xmath35 ,",
    "the fermionic ground state has the form @xmath36 , corresponding to the fermion being in the @xmath37 quasi - momentum eigenstate .",
    "after a quench in which interactions between fermions and bosons are turned on and tunnelling amplitudes for fermions and bosons are set to zero , the site occupations @xmath38 remain constant due to the absence of tunnelling .",
    "the off - diagonal correlations of the single - particle density matrix , however , evolve in time : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the number of bosons on site 1 ( 2 ) .",

    "the latter is provided by the quantum fluctuations of the on - site occupation that are characteristic for a bec .",
    "since this specific example of a two - site model only contains one fermion , quantum statistics does not play a role in the dynamics of @xmath49 .",
    "however , quantum statistics plays an essential role in the dynamics of the quasi - momentum distribution when , as in the experiments , many fermions are present .",
    "to characterise the quench dynamics in a setup with many lattice sites , it is convenient to study the visibility of the fermionic quasi - momentum distribution . we define it as the ratio between the number of fermions with quasi - momenta in the interval @xmath50 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a ) and the total fermion number @xmath6 , @xmath51 . for the case of a 1d lattice and an initial state @xmath19 ,",
    "the time evolution of the visibility after the quench can be calculated analytically in the thermodynamic limit ( see methods ) .",

    "analogous to the two - site case , the periodicity of the oscillation is determined by @xmath56 , and the coherent dynamics originates from the presence of off - diagonal single particle correlations and on - site occupancy fluctuations of the bec .",

    "the theoretical analysis can be extended to three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattices , where @xmath59 is taken to be the projection of the full fermionic quasi - momentum distribution @xmath60 onto one dimension , @xmath61 .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to eq .",
    "( see methods ) .",
    "the experiment begins with the preparation of a quantum degenerate mixture of @xmath62 fermionic @xmath63k and @xmath64 bosonic @xmath65rb atoms in their absolute hyperfine ground states @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the temperature of the spin - polarised fermi gas is typically @xmath68 .",

    "then , we quench the system by rapidly increasing the lattice depth to @xmath80 , suppressing the tunnel coupling between lattice sites and initiating coherent nonequilibrium dynamics of the fermi - bose many - body state . after letting the system evolve for variable hold times @xmath81 ,",
    "all trapping potentials are suddenly switched off and an absorption image of the momentum distribution of @xmath63k is recorded after 9 ms time - of - flight expansion ( see fig .  [ fig:2]a , inset ) .",
    "the dynamics of the fermionic many - body state is revealed via oscillations in the momentum distribution ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",

    "this confirms that the quench dynamics is driven by the interspecies interaction @xmath98 . in general",
    ", we observe oscillation amplitudes that are significantly smaller than in the case of bosonic collapse and revival dynamics@xcite .",
    "the reason is that only correlations between fermions on sites with bosons contribute to the dynamics , while unaccompanied fermions form a static background .",

    "although the total atom numbers are comparable , the fermionic cloud is about 10 times larger in volume than the bosonic one .",

    "the differential gravitational sag between the clouds has been measured to be 8(2 ) @xmath84 m .",
    "this value was confirmed by a detailed mathematical model of the optical dipole trap in use.@xcite following the above assessment , the in - trap arrangement of the ellipsoidal fermion and boson clouds is illustrated to scale in supplementary figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "only the volume in which fermions and bosons overlap ( plus a thin shell of few lattice sites , which represents the coherence length of the fermions ) contributes to the fermionic quench dynamics . for our parameters about 5% of the fermions do overlap with the bosons",
    "this is compatible with the amplitude of the fermionic quench dynamics shown in fig .",
    "2c of the main text , corresponding to about 5% of the atomic density in momentum space .",
    "in addition to the oscillation amplitude of the observed quench dynamics , the in - trap arrangement of the fermi - bose mixture explains the absence of higher harmonics @xmath197 from the spectra .",
    "for example , a peak at @xmath198 appears for correlations between lattice sites that have a difference in boson number of @xmath199 ( see two - site model in the main text ) .",
    "this requires that fermions have overlap with the high density region of the boson cloud .",
    "however , for our experimental parameters ( see methods ) a significant bosonic occupation of two can only be found in the centre of the bosonic cloud , where in turn the fermionic density - since it is the rim of the fermion cloud - is already much smaller than the mean value of the density of about 0.1 fermion per lattice site .",
    "therefore , correlations between lattice sites that would give rise to higher harmonics are suppressed below the 10% noise level that is present in the experimental spectra ( compare fig .  3 of the main text ) .",
    "three - body loss could be an additional explanation for the absence of higher harmonics .",
