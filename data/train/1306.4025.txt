    "models of opinion formation have been studied by physicists since the 80 s and are now part of the new branch of physics called sociophysics @xcite .",
    "this recent research area uses tools and concepts of the physics of disordered matter and more recently from the network science to describe some aspects of social and political behavior @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , opinion models are interesting to physicists because they present correlations , order - disorder transitions , scaling and universality , among other typical features of physical systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied models to analyze the dynamics of agreement and disagreement is the voter model ( vm ) @xcite .",
    "the vm was introduced to study the competition of species @xcite and was firstly named voter model in the work of holley and ligget @xcite .",
    "it represents a very simple formulation of opinion dynamics , where each agent carries one opinion given by an ising variable @xmath7 and a randomly choosen agent takes the opinion of one of his neighbors at each time step . in other words ,",
    "the vm is a paradigmatic example of nonequilibrium copying dynamics , where the agents imitate their neighbors . concerning regular lattices ,",
    "this model can be exactly solved in any dimension @xcite . besides the simplicity of the model",
    ", it was shown that the two - dimensional vm represents a broad class of models , defining a kind of voter - model universality class @xcite .",
    "the vm was extended to take into account different ingredients . as examples",
    ", we can cite the generalization to three @xcite or more variables @xcite , the inclusion of special agents like zealots @xcite , introduction of memory @xcite and time - dependent transition rates @xcite , and others .",
    "the model was also studied in several types of complex networks , that have nontrivial effects on the ordering dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the interactions among individuals , it is also interesting from theoretical and practical points of view to analyze the influence of external effects on agent - based social models @xcite . in opinion dynamics , for example , these external effects act in the system as a mass media ( television , radio , ... ) . among the previous studies considering mass - media effects",
    ", one can cite the sznajd opinion model @xcite , the axelrod model of culture diversity @xcite and some other social models @xcite .",
    "the external effects make social models more realistic , and they may produce interesting results like the induction / suppression of phase transitions , the decrease of the relaxation times and the emergence / lack of consensus .",
    "in this work we study a three - state opinion model , where the agents states or opinions are represented by variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the agents change their opinions via two competing mechanisms .",
    "two agents may interact via a voter - model dynamics , but the usual imitation process is limited by a particular feature of each agent , his conviction , a characteristic that was considered in some opinion models @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a noise in the system that allows the agents to change their opinions to @xmath11 .",
    "we analyze the consequences of these two ingredients , convictions and noise , on opinion formation and on opinion spreading across the population . after the initial analysis",
    ", we add an external effect that acts in the system as a mass medium , and we study the consequences of the presence of this external effect on the behavior of the model .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the miscroscopic rules that define the model .",
    "the numerical and analytical results are discussed in section 3 , and our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "we have considered a square lattice of size @xmath12 with periodic boundary conditions as a simple representation of the social contacts among individuals .",
    "each agent @xmath13 in the population may be in one of three possible states , namely @xmath14 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "this scenario can represent any public debate , for example an electoral process with 2 different candidates a and b where each agent ( or elector ) votes for the candidate a ( opinion @xmath15 ) , for the candidate b ( opinion @xmath9 ) or is undecided ( opinion @xmath10 ) .",
    "in addition , each agent has a conviction @xmath16 about his opinion . in the case of undecided voters ,",
    "this conviction is given by @xmath17 , and for the cases of opinions @xmath15 and @xmath9 each conviction is given by a random number generated from a uniform distribution @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the following microscopic rules control our model :    * we choose a random agent @xmath13 ; * we choose at random one of his nearest neighbors , say @xmath19 ; * if @xmath20 , nothing occurs ; * on the other hand , if @xmath21 , the agent with the lower conviction , say @xmath19 , is persuaded by @xmath13 and adopt both the opinion and the conviction of @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath22 we update @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; * if one of the two agents , say @xmath19 , is undecided ( @xmath25 ) , he follows the opinion of agent @xmath13 and take his conviction about that opinion , i.e. , we update @xmath23 and @xmath24 . *",
    "we choose at random another nearest neighbor of @xmath13 ( different from @xmath19 ) , say @xmath26 . with probability @xmath1",
    "this agent @xmath26 becomes undecided , i.e. , we update @xmath27 and @xmath28 ;    thus , the interactions are of voter - model type @xcite , but the usual imitation or copying process is limited by the agents convictions .",
    "in addition , we considered that a certain persuaded agent takes not only the opinion but also the conviction of the agent that interacted with him . in the case of undecided voters",
    ", we considered that the convictions are @xmath17 , and thus they are easily persuaded by decided voters . for undecided voters does not change qualitatively the results of the model , as discussed in the following . ]",
    "notice also that the probability @xmath1 acts as a noise in the system , and it allows the spontaneous change of opinions ( to @xmath11 ) of some agents @xcite .",
    "observe also the presence of intrinsic correlations in the system : the interacting agents @xmath13 and @xmath19 , as well as the agent @xmath26 that suffers the effect of noise are always neighbors in the square lattice .",
    "then , our dynamics inserts correlation effects on the noise itself .",
    "some consequences of these correlations are discussed in the next section . in the following",
    "we will see that the presence of such heterogeneities in the population ( convictions and noise ) affects the persuasion process and the consensus states are obtained only in the absense of noise .",
    "we will also analyze an extension of the model considering an external effect , that acts in the system as a mass medium .    for the above - mentioned rules",
    ", we made the following assumptions : ( i ) as the agents interact by pairs , we have considered that if a given agent persuades another agent to change opinion ( explaining the reasons for choosing a certain candidate , for example ) , the persuaded individual will became a supporter of the choosen opinion ( candidate ) and he will influence other individuals based on the `` learned '' reasons ; ( ii ) undecided individuals or voters are passive , in the sense that they do not spread their lack of opinion to other individuals @xcite ; ( iii ) undecided agents are easily persuaded by interaction with someone that already has a formed opinion ( which explain the null convictions ) ; ( iv ) the noise @xmath1 represents the fact that some individuals in an electoral process choose a certain candidate at some time but they are not sure about their choices ( in this case , those individuals may become undecided until interact with other agents ) .",
    "in the absence of external effects , the model follows exactly the rules presented in the previous section .",
    "the initial state of the system is fully disordered , i.e. , all opinions are equally probable ( @xmath29 for each one ) .",
    "one time step in the model is defined by the application of the above - mentioned rules @xmath30 times , where @xmath31 is the total number of agents in the lattice . as a first analysis ,",
    "we have considered the order parameter @xmath32 given by @xmath33     and the fractions @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the agents with opinions @xmath15 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , in the absence of external effects .",

    "we have observed that in the steady states the fraction of one of the extreme opinions @xmath15 or @xmath9 are not found anymore in the population .",
    "thus , in the stationary states the magnetization is given by @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) in the case where the opinion @xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) disappears of the system , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the fraction of @xmath15 ( @xmath9 ) opinions . in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] that the system reaches consensus with all opinions @xmath15 or @xmath9 only for @xmath38 .",

    "one can consider the processes contributing to the in / out flux for @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the flux into @xmath36 is given by @xmath55 , which corresponds to the sixth rule of section 2 ( the noise effect , i.e. , the spontaneous change to opinion @xmath11 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the flux out of @xmath36 is given by @xmath56 , which corresponds to pick randomly an agent @xmath13 with opinion @xmath57 ( probability @xmath36 ) and then another random agent @xmath19 with opinion @xmath58 or @xmath9 ( complementary probability @xmath59 ) .",

    "these results are in agreement with the simulations of the model on the square lattice",
    ".    we can confront these analytical calculations with numerical simulations for the model in the mean - field limit . in this case , all the three involved individuals ( @xmath13 , @xmath19 and @xmath26 in the notation of the rules in section 2 ) are randomly choosen . in order to obtain the averages @xmath51 and @xmath48 , we have performed @xmath50 independent simulations of populations of size @xmath49 agents .",
    "the result is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "one can see that the numerical results in the fully - connected lattice agree with the derived eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , i.e. , the stationary fraction @xmath48 of undecided individuals grows linearly with the noise @xmath1 , whereas the order parameter @xmath51 decays linearly with @xmath1 [ see the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ] .",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) . in order to clarify",
    "if the origin of crossing of the curves is a consequence of the topology or of the presence of correlations in the system ( as discussed in section 2 ) , we performed simulations with a small modification in the sixth rule of the model ( see section 2 ) .",
    "for this purpose , we choose at random the agent @xmath26 that will suffer the noise effect , which eliminates the correlations on the noise itself and keeps only the correlations due to the interactions among nearest neighbors ( @xmath13 and @xmath19 in the language of seciton 2 ) .",
    "we have verified that the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath48 can also be fitted with second - order polynomials , but different from those of the previous case . in this case , the crossing of the mentioned quantities also occurs , but in a different point , @xmath74 ( not shown ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the crossing of the @xmath51 and @xmath48 curves for the 2d case is a consequence of the correlations introduced by the topology on the system , i.e. , by the fact that a given agent @xmath13 can interact ( in a voter - like way ) only with one of his four nearest neighbors , that are always the same during all the dynamics .",
    "the presence of correlations on the noise causes only a shift from @xmath75 to @xmath53 of the crossing point .",
    "however , one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) that in the limit of weak noise the mf equations describe well the two - dimensional results .",

    "the individuals may be in one of three distinct states , represented by opinions @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the agents change their opinions via two competing mechanisms .",
    "first , two agents may interact via a voter - model dynamics , but the usual copying process is limited by the agents convictions .",
    "furthermore , we have considered that in a given interaction the persuaded agent takes the opinion and the conviction of the agent that interacted with him . to our knowledge",
    ", the presence of convictions was analyzed in some works ( see for example @xcite ) , but not as we done .",
    "the second mechanism is a noise @xmath1 , which allows agents to change their opinions to the undecided state @xmath11 .",
    "as the agents that participate of the dynamics in a given time step are nearest neighbors in the square lattice , the dynamics inserts correlation effects on the system and on the noise itself .",
    "these rules are realistic ingredients to be considered in opinion dynamics .",
    "we have verified that the system reaches consensus only in the absence of noise ( @xmath38 ) , and in this case the relaxation times are log - normally distributed .",

    "for @xmath122 we have observed that one of the extreme opinions @xmath15 or @xmath9 disappears of the system , and the surviving extreme opinion coexists with the @xmath10 opinion .",
    "the fraction of @xmath11 opinions in the stationary states grows fast with increasing values of @xmath1 , and a numerical analysis of the simulation data suggests that the above - mentioned surviving opinion is the majority opinion in the population for @xmath123 , being overcome by the opinion @xmath10 for @xmath124 , where @xmath125 .",
    "we extended the model to consider external effects .",
    "these effects act in the system as a mass medium ( tv , radio , ... ) and are quantified by a parameter @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath86 is greater than the conviction of a given agent , this agent follows the media opinion , that we have considered as @xmath15 .",
    "the first consequence of the media effect appears in the stationary fraction of @xmath11 opinions , that grows linearly with the noise @xmath1 for all values of @xmath126 , i.e. , in a slower way than in the absence of external effects . in the absence of noise ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "the scenario is similar to the case with no media effect , i.e. , the system reaches consensus but in a faster way than in the case @xmath127 , but the @xmath9 opinion does not disappears of the system . in the other extreme situation , @xmath117 , the opinion @xmath9 disappears of the system in the stationary states for all values of the noise @xmath1 , and the fraction of @xmath15 opinions decays linearly with the increase of @xmath1 . for the intermediary values of @xmath86 ,",
    "i.e. , in the range @xmath111 , we have observed that the opinion @xmath9 persists in the long - time limit for all values of the noise @xmath1 .",
    "based on the simulation data we verified that , for a given value of @xmath86 , the media opinion @xmath15 in the stationary states is the majority opinion in the population only for @xmath128 , being overcome by the opinion @xmath9 for @xmath129 . in other words , even a strong effect of advertising may not be enough to make winner the opinion supported by the mass media , which is a nontrivial result .",
    "the real dynamics of the human societies is very complicated .",
    "however , our model can simulate real situations in communities . in any public debate",
    ", the discrete opinions considered in our model can represent extreme favorable opinion ( @xmath8 ) , extreme unfavourable opinion ( @xmath85 ) or indecision ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus the order parameter in the model corresponds to the overall rating and the ordered state means there is a clear decision made .",
    "for example , in an electoral process with two different candidates a and b , each elector ( agent ) votes for the candidate a ( opinion @xmath8 ) , for the candidate b ( opinion @xmath85 ) or is undecided ( opinion @xmath11 ) .",
    "the competition of the convictions in an interaction can be seen as the competition between the persuasiveness of an agent and the resistance of the other agent to change your candidate .",
    "the noise @xmath1 represents the volatility of some individuals , that tend to spontaneously change your choices . finally , the external effect introduced in section 3.2 models the effect of advertising on the individuals choices .",
    "in fact , the electorate is susceptible to the effects of electoral surveys broadcasted by the mass media .",
    "furthermore , the occurrence of consensus states with @xmath73 are usually related to dictatorships , whereas the states with @xmath130 are desirable since they represent democracy - like situations @xcite .",
    "another example is the dynamics of agents on financial markets , where the opinions represent the decision for selling stocks ( @xmath8 ) , the decision for buying stocks ( @xmath8 ) or the decision to do nothing ( @xmath11 ) . in this case , when a pair of agents with opposite decisions @xmath15 and @xmath9 interacts , one of the two agents can be persuaded to change your choice ( the agent with lower conviction ) .",
    "the noise @xmath1 in this case represents the decision of an agent to stop their actions of selling or buying stocks , maybe due to fluctuations on the stock prices .",
    "on the other hand , the external effect models the campaign made by some companies ( in television , for example ) in order to sell their stocks .",
    "the presence of special individuals like contrarians , inflexibles , opportunists or stubborn agents was considered in some opinion models @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the present model to include the above - mentioned agents and study the impact of their actions on opinion formation .",
    "in addition , one can also study the properties of the model in various lattices and networks .",
