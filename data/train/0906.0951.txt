    "intermediate - mass black holes ( imbh ; @xmath4 ) accreting gas from their surroundings have been postulated to explain the engines behind ultraluminous x - ray sources recently discovered in nearby galaxies ( see colbert & miller 2005 , for a review ) .",
    "imbhs would fill the existing gap between stellar and supermassive black holes found in active galactic nuclei . according to the tight relation between @xmath5 and the central velocity dispersion @xmath6 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merrit 2000 ; tremaine et al .  2002 ) , or between @xmath5 and the mass of the bulge ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , a natural place to look for these imbhs are astrophysical systems less massive than normal galaxies , such as dense star clusters , globular clusters , and dwarf galaxies . if @xmath5 is correlated with the total gravitational mass of their host galaxy ( ferrarese 2002 ; baes et al .",
    "2003 ) , central bhs should be an essential element in dark matter dominated objects -such as dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies .",
    "estimates of the mass of bh in these systems would be of great importance in completing the @xmath2 relation .",
    "direct and indirect searches for imbh at the centers of globular clusters and small galaxies have been attempted ( e.g. , gerssen et al .  2002 , 2003 ;",
    "valluri et al .",
    "2005 ; maccarone et al .  2005 ; ghosh et al .",
    "2006 ; maccarone et al .",
    "2007 ; noyola et al .  2008 ) .",
    "for instance , noyola et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have reported a central density cusp and higher velocity dispersions in their central field of the globular cluster @xmath7 centauri , which could be due to a central bh ( @xmath8 ) . however",
    ", a new analysis by anderson & van der marel ( 2009 ) and van der marel & anderson ( 2009 ) does not confirm the arguments given by noyola et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and provides an upper limit for the bh mass of @xmath9 .",
    "there is sparse evidence that bhs could be present in at least some dsph .",
    "the ursa minor ( umi ) dsph galaxy has been also suspected to contain a bh of @xmath10 @xmath1 ( strobel & lake 1994 ; demers et al .",
    "maccarone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) discuss the possibility that the radio source found near the core of umi is , in fact , a bh with a mass @xmath11 .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the dynamical effects of putative imbhs in the core of dsphs on the very integrity of cold , long - lived substructure as that observed on the northeast side of the major axis of umi .",
    "although umi has long been suspected of experiencing ongoing tidal disruption , regions with enhanced volume density and cold kinematics can not be the result of tidal interactions ( kleyna et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter k03 ; read et al .",
    "2006 ; snchez - salcedo & lora 2007 ) .",
    "this suggests that the secondary peak in umi is a long - lived structure , surviving in phase - space because the underlying gravitational potential is close to harmonic ( k03 ) .",
    "snchez - salcedo & lora ( 2007 ) derived an upper limit on the mass and abundance of massive dark objects in the halo of umi to avoid a quick destruction of the clump by the continuous gravitational encounters with these objects . in this work",
    ", we will assume that the dark halo is comprised of a smooth distribution of elementary particles and then study the disintegration of the clump , placing contraints on the mass of a possible central imbh in umi .",
    "ursa minor , located at a galactocentric distance of @xmath13  kpc ( carrera et al .",
    "2002 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2002 ) , is one of the most dark matter - dominated dsphs in the local group , with a central mass - to - light ratio @xmath14 @xmath1/@xmath15 ( e.g. , wilkinson et al .",
    "the measured central velocity dispersion is @xmath16 km s@xmath17 ( muoz et al .",
    "2005 ) and the core radius of the stellar component along the semimajor axis is @xmath18  pc ( palma et al .",
    "umi reveals several morphological peculiarities : ( 1 ) the shape of the inner isodensity contours of the surface density of stars appears to have a large ellipticity of @xmath19 , ( 2 ) the highest density of stars is not found at the center of symmetry of the outer isodensity contours but instead is offset southwest of center , ( 3 ) the secondary density peak on the northeast of the major axis is kinematically cold .",
    "the secondary density peak has a @xmath20 radius of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 pc at a distance of @xmath23 kpc ) when fitted with a gaussian profile .",
    "the stellar distribution that forms this density excess is elongated not along the major axis of the isodensity contours of the elliptized king model , but along a line at an intermediate angle between the major and minor axes of these contours ( palma et al .",
    "the bend in the isodensity contours indicates that such clump is gravitationally unbound .",
    "interestingly , k03 found that the velocity of stars within a @xmath24 ( @xmath25 pc ) radius aperture on the clump are best fitted by a two - gaussian population , one representing the underlying @xmath26 km s@xmath17 population , and the other with a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath27  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "although the value of the cold population is ill determined , we can be certain that the velocity dispersion is @xmath28  km  s@xmath17 at a 95% confidence level .",
    "the mean velocity of the cold population is equal to the systemic velocity of umi , implying that either the orbit is radial and the clump is now at apocenter or the orbit lies in the plane of the sky ( k03 ) .",
    "we consider the evolution of a clump inside a rigid halo of dark matter with a density law : @xmath29^{2}\\right)^{1/2 } } , \\label{eq : densitydm}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the central density and @xmath31 is the dark halo core radius .",
    "this profile was chosen in order to facilitate comparison with k03 .",
    "we explore different values for @xmath31 .",
    "following k03 , once @xmath31 is fixed , we rescale the central density to have a dark matter mass of @xmath32 @xmath1 inside @xmath33 pc , which is approximately the maximum extent of the stellar distribution observed in umi . therefore ,",
    "in all our models , we have a total mass - to - light ratio of @xmath34 inside @xmath33  pc , for a visual luminosity @xmath35 @xmath36 ( palma et al .",
    "2003 ) .    for a normal stellar population with @xmath37 ,",
    "the stellar mass within the core radius of the dwarf is @xmath38 , whereas the dark matter mass is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the potential of the baryonic mass was ignored .",
    "the initial density profile of the clump follows a plummer mass distribution , @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath1 is the total mass of the clump and @xmath42 is the plummer radius .",
    "one should note that there is a simple relation for a plummer model between @xmath42 and the half - mass radius : @xmath43 .",
    "we use @xmath44 values between @xmath45 and @xmath46 pc to initialize our simulations . the clump s self - gravity",
    "is included to have a realistic and complete description of its internal dynamics because , as we will see later , the tidal radius of the clump may be larger than @xmath44 when large values of @xmath31 are used .",
    "the clump is dropped at the apogalactocentric distance of @xmath47 pc from the umi center with a certain tangential velocity @xmath48 , which defines the eccentricity @xmath49 of the orbit .",
    "the orbit of the clump lies in the @xmath50-@xmath51 plane , which is also the plane of the sky . for simulations with a central bh ,",
    "it is clear that the evolution of the clump depends on its orbital eccentricity .",
    "for instance , we found that for a radial orbit , the bh dissolves the group of stars in its first passage through the galactic center . in order to provide an upper limit on the mass of the bh and since there is more phase space available for nearly circular orbits than for radial ones , we will take , in most of our simulations , a rather circular orbit with @xmath52 , which corresponds to @xmath53 km s@xmath17 for @xmath54 pc .",
    "however , to our surprise , the disintegration time was found to be insensitive to the initial eccentricity of the clump s orbit as long as @xmath55 .",
    "altogether , there are essentially three model parameters that we have explored in our simulations : @xmath31 , @xmath44 and @xmath5 .",
    "we developed an n - body code that links an individual timestep to each particle in the simulation .",
    "only for the particle that has the minimum associated time , the equations of motion are integrated ( with a second order predictor - corrector method ) .",
    "this `` multi - timestep '' method reduces the typical cpu time of direct , particle - particle integrations ( @xmath57 , with @xmath56 the number of particles ) , and allows integrations of systems of @xmath581000 particles to be carried out with relatively short cpu times .",
    "the cluster density is so tiny that the internal relaxation timescale is very long ( @xmath59 gyr for an initial cluster with @xmath60 pc ) .",
    "therefore , although our code is suitable to include two- and three - body encounters , the cluster behaves as collisionless and internal processes such as evaporation do not contribute to the dissolution of the cluster .",
    "for the same reason , all the particles have the same mass , and the presence of binaries was ignored .",
    "all the simulations presented in this paper used @xmath33 particles , each one having a mass of @xmath61 .",
    "we chose a smoothing length of @xmath62 pc , which is approximately 1/10th the typical separation among cluster particles within @xmath44 at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the convergence of the results was tested by comparing runs with different softening length and @xmath56 .",
    "the effect of adopting a dfferent smoothing radius between @xmath63 and @xmath64 times the typical distance was found to be insignificant .",
    "we run the same simulation with different @xmath56 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 particles ) , and convergence was found for @xmath67 .    in order to validate our simulations",
    ", we checked that , when the cluster evolves at isolation , the plummer configuration is stationary and that the energy is conserved over @xmath68 gyr . to be certain that the interaction with the bh is resolved well , we compared the change in kinetic energy of the cluster , when colliding with a particle of mass @xmath69 , moving at @xmath47 km s@xmath17 , with the predictions in the impulse approximation ( binney & tremaine 2008 ) , for different impact parameters , and found good agreement ( differences less than @xmath70 ) between them .",
    "we were also able to reproduce k03 simulations of the evolution of an unbound clump ( ignoring self - gravity ) in the gravitational potential created by the mass distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : densitydm ] ) .",
    "we confirm the k03 claim that even if the clump is initially very compact , with a @xmath20 radius of @xmath68 pc , cusped halos can not explain the survival of the substructure for more than @xmath64 gyr , while the substructure can persist for @xmath71 gyr in halos with core radii @xmath72@xmath73 times the clump s orbit .",
    "we have first examined the evolution of a clump with @xmath60 pc embedded in a galaxy with a large core of @xmath74 pc ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : b510 ] ) . note that when self - gravity is included , an initial @xmath44 value of @xmath75 pc , as that used in k03 , is no longer realistic because the clump remains too compact over its lifetime to explain its present appearance .",
    "with self - gravity , strong substructure continues to persist for a hubble time , while in the non - self - gravitating case the substructure is completely erased in @xmath76 gyr .",
    "the evolution of the same self - gravitating clump but in a galaxy with @xmath77 pc is also shown in fig . [",
    "fig : b510 ] .",
    "as expected , when the size of the galaxy core is decreased , the clump does not survive so long , but we can have a galaxy core of @xmath78 pc without causing the clump to disintegrate in @xmath79 gyr .",
    "we confirm the k03 claim that cored halos allow the structures to remain uncorrupted for a hubble time .",
    "moreover , we find that , when including self - gravity , a galaxy core of @xmath80 times the clump s orbit is enough to preserve the integrity of the clump .",
    "if umi hosts an imbh , the density substructure is erased not only by the orbital phase mixing and the tidal field of the galaxy but also by the gravitational interaction with the hypothetical bh .",
    "since the destructive effects depend on the mass of the bh , we can establish an upper limit on the mass of the bh in umi by imposing that the bh must preserve the longevity of the clump for more than @xmath81  gyr .",
    "we proceeded to add a massive particle of @xmath82 at the center of the galaxy potential , emulating a bh .",
    "figure  [ fig : std1 ] shows the evolution of a self - gravitating clump with an initial size of @xmath60 pc in a galaxy with @xmath54  pc . under the influence of the gravitational pull exerted by the clump , the bh ,",
    "initially at rest , is displaced from the center of umi .",
    "the azimuthal orbital lag angle of the bh in the @xmath83 plane is @xmath84 . as a consequence",
    ", the clump feels a gravitational drag and loses angular momentum which is transferred to the bh . due to the angular momentum loss ,",
    "the clump starts to spiral into the center . at @xmath72 gyr",
    ", we can see that , in fact , the clump has smaller orbital radius than it would have in the absence of the bh ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : std1 ] ) .",
    "the bh , on the other hand , spirals outwards to larger radii until it reaches its maximum galactocentric radius . at @xmath85 gyr ,",
    "the clump reaches the galactic center and this `` exchange '' of orbits starts all over again .",
    "therefore , when looking at the bh of umi , one should bear in mind that the bh does not necessarily settle into the center of the galaxy .",
    "it would be interesting to perform n - body simulations including the stellar background to elucidate if the two observed off - centered regions with the highest stellar density ( e.g. , palma et al .",
    "2003 ) are a consequence of the dynamical response to the bh .",
    "the minimum distance between the bh and the center of mass of the clump is @xmath86 pc in this model .",
    "since the orbits of the clump and the bh never cross , the tidal disruption of the group of stars can be described as a secular process of stellar diffusion in phase - space .",
    "this slow relaxation process forms a stellar debris of stripped stars that move on a galactic orbit very similar to that of the clump itself .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : std1 ] we see that , under the influence of the bh , the clump is completely dissolved at @xmath87 gyr . in order to quantify the clump s evolution , we calculated a map of the surface density of particles in the @xmath83 plane at any given time @xmath88 .",
    "we sample this two - dimensional map searching for the parcel ( of @xmath89 pc size ) that contains the highest number of stars @xmath90 .",
    "this region is centered at the remnant of the clump .",
    "the number of stars @xmath91 as a function of time is shown in fig .  [ fig : nmax ] .",
    "as expected , @xmath91 decreases as the simulation evolves due to the spatial dilution of the clump caused by tidal heating .",
    "once @xmath91 drops a factor @xmath72 , which occurs in @xmath92 gyr , the tidal disruption process is accelerated and @xmath91 dramatically declines at @xmath93 gyr ( around the orbit @xmath94 ) , which can be taken as the disruption time , denoted by @xmath95 .",
    "the disruption of the clump was confirmed by visual inspection of the simulations .",
    "further simulations show that even if the eccentricity of the orbit is similar to that of the isodensity contours of the surface density of umi background stars , the disruption time is essentially the same .",
    "we carried out simulations with @xmath60 pc , @xmath54 pc and @xmath96 , but with different @xmath5 .",
    "we found that the substructure disintegrates in @xmath97 gyr for a @xmath98 @xmath1 bh , and in @xmath72 gyr for @xmath99 @xmath1 .",
    "we also explored different combinations for @xmath31 and @xmath44 .",
    "a reduction of the core of the galaxy leads to a more stringent upper limit on the mass of the bh .",
    "however , one can increase the longevity of the structure if a smaller value for @xmath44 is adopted .",
    "for instance , we also find that @xmath100 gyr for @xmath101 pc , @xmath102 pc and @xmath103 @xmath1 .    in the absence of any knowledge about the initial dynamical state of the bh",
    ", the most natural assumption is that the center of the galaxy was its presumed birth site pc from the center . ] . for completeness",
    ", we have also carried out simulations for an off - centered bh .",
    "a compilation of the models is given in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "when the bh is on radial orbit , @xmath104@xmath105 gyr , for @xmath106 . only in very special circunstances",
    "when the bh is not on a radial orbit , the orbits are coplanar and the azimuthal lag angle is @xmath107 , the disruption of the cluster is less efficient because the separation between the clump and the bh is larger on average over the simulation .    we conclude that , if umi s clumpiness is a primordial artifact , then the survival of the secondary peak imposes an upper limit on the mass of the putative bh of @xmath108 @xmath1 , if the bh originally lurked at the center .",
    "the extrapolation of the @xmath2 relation for elliptical galaxies ( gultekin et al .",
    "2009 ) predicts a @xmath109 @xmath1 bh for umi .",
    "therefore , our constraint is still consistent with both the extrapolated value and that inferred by maccarone et al .",

    "our self - gravitating simulations confirm the claim of k03 that the dark halo of umi must have a core radius of @xmath18 pc , comparable to the core radius of the underlying stellar population , in order to preserve the integrity of this clump .",
    "while the firm dynamical detection of an imbh in any dsph galaxy is challenging because it requires observations of the velocity dispersion of stars deep into the core , we have demonstrated that the very integrity of kinematically cold substructure in dsph galaxies may impose useful limits not only on the core of the galaxy but also on the mass of putative bhs . in the case of umi ,",
    "the maximum mass of a bh initially seated at the centre of the potential or initially on radial orbit , is @xmath0 @xmath1 . when searching for direct detection of the possible imbh in umi ( e.g. , maccarone et al .",
    "2005 ) , one should keep in mind that the bh may be offset from the galactic center because of the gravitational pull exerted by the clump .    as pointed out by the referee",
    ", the contour map of the surface brightness of the nucleus of m31 also has a bright off - center source ( fig .  2 of lauer et al .",
    "1993 ) , which was interpreted not as a separate stellar system but as the apoapsis region of an eccentric stellar disk orbiting a central massive bh ( tremaine 1995 ; lauer et al .",
    "the timing problem of the clump may be circumvented if one assumes that the secondary peak of umi is the part of a ring close to apoapsis .",
    "since the stars forming the secondary peak in umi have a mean velocity equal to the systemic velocity of umi , the ring should lie close to the plane of the sky and should be very eccentric .",
    "a serious difficulty with this scenario is that the apsides of the orbits need to be extremely aligned .",
    "our simulations have shown that this alignment is not possible if the ring is the tidal debris of a stellar cluster .",
    "we do not know a satisfactory mechanism to explain the formation of a very eccentric stellar ring at scales of a galaxy with the required apsidal alignment .",
