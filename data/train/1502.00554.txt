    "dense coding is a quantum communication technique that allows one to send two bits of classical information per single qubit transmitted over a quantum channel .",
    "this becomes possible when a sender and a receiver pre - share a maximally entangled two - qubit state ( bell state ) .",
    "of course , if no entanglement is shared , at most one bit of classical information can be communicated by sending a single qubit .",
    "therefore , using entanglement as a communication resource increases channel capacity by @xmath0 .",
    "the original protocol  @xcite  closely followed in all optical qubit implementations  @xcite  was designed for generic qubits and has two main requirements .",
    "first , the sender must be able to generate all four bell states from any given bell state via a local ( single - qubit ) operations only .",
    "second , the receiver must be able to perform an unambiguous bell state discrimination ( typically using a two - qubit cnot gate ) . for optical qubits  most suitable for a long distance communication  the first requirement can be readily fulfilled by combining spontaneous parametric down conversion entangled photon sources with linear optical devices such as beam splitters , polarization rotators and phase shifters .",
    "however , the second requirement of the original protocol is very stringent .",
    "unfortunately , one can not deterministically distinguish all four bell states only by means of linear optical devices and coincidence measurements  @xcite .",
    "either hyper entanglement  @xcite or additional entangled ancillae are needed  @xcite making all - optical implementations challenging . as a result ,",
    "the entanglement - assisted channel capacity gain is bounded by @xmath4 . but",
    "even achieving the reduced bound is fairly difficult due to experimental imperfections .",
    "for instance , the actual channel capacity gain reported in  @xcite was @xmath5 .",
    "this prompted us to ask the following question : are there alternative entanglement - assisted protocols ( not based on bell states ) that utilize only linear optics , coincidence photon counting and input single photon product states and , at the same time , provide a greater capacity gain than @xmath1 ?",
    "we answer this question by constructing a communication protocol that satisfies the above resource constraints .",
    "in particular , we find an equivalence class of four - mode two - photon entangled states that can be prepared using product single photon input states with linear optical elements and transformed into each other by means of linear optical operations on ( two ) `` local '' modes of one of the parties and , at the same time , can be discriminated by a photon coincidence measurement deterministically .",
    "we formalize the problem mathematically in section  [ sec : method ] and show that the explicit structure of these states as well as the detailed experimental setup that implements our protocol can be obtained by maximizing the mutual information between the sender and the receiver over all physical input states , local / global operations and detection schemes . by solving the optimization task numerically in section  [ sec:3 ] , we find that the communication channel capacity of our protocol with ideal detectors is 2 @xmath6 . to verify that entanglement",
    "does indeed provide a gain in the channel capacity we determine the upper bound on the channel capacity with respect to all possible resource - equivalent entanglement - free protocols .",
    "we show in section  [ sec:3 ] that , under the condition of no vacuum detection , no entanglement - free protocol can achieve the channel capacity greater than 1 @xmath7 and , thus , our protocol allows the sender to communicate an extra 1 @xmath7 of classical information which is better than the gain of @xmath1 offered by dense coding with linear optics .",
    "on the other hand , we demonstrate that if vacuum detection is allowed but detectors are imperfect then our protocol still provides a detection - efficiency - dependent channel capacity gain .",
    "for example , the gain is @xmath8 for the state - of - the - art superconducting single photon detectors .",
    "also , our protocol can be extended to the case of two photons shared among @xmath9 modes and in the section  [ sec : nmodes ] we consider two scenarios with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we show that in both cases solutions exist that provide a capacity gain over corresponding entanglement - free protocols .",
    "when implementing an abstract two - qubit system using single photons two so - called `` dual rail '' schemes are prevalent .",
    "the first one is the polarization encoding where the logical zero and one states of each qubit are realized as the horizontally @xmath12 and vertically @xmath13 polarized single photon in a given spatial mode and the second is the spatial mode encoding where a single photon placed in either one of two spatial modes i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 represents the logical zero and one states .",
    "the schemes can be mapped onto each other by setting @xmath16 .",
    "an arbitrary local ( involving modes of one of the parties only ) operation can be performed by means of linear optical elements such as a polarization rotator or a beam splitter in the case of dual rail encoding .",
    "this class of operations will map the two - qubit computational space @xmath17 onto itself .",
    "however , when implementing an operation involving spatial modes from both parties with linear optics an input state from @xmath18 may end up in a larger hilbert space @xmath19 .",
    "for example , consider the action of a 50/50 beam splitter between modes 2 and 3 on the state @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting state @xmath21 actually lies outside of @xmath18 in a larger hilbert space @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , this becomes an issue when one tries to implement a quantum computer using only linear optical transformations .",
    "but for quantum communication problems it may be more advantageous to operate in the full ( two photons in four modes ) hilbert space @xmath19 .    indeed , consider the following communication protocol implemented using @xmath22 modes and @xmath23 photons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the source generates a special initial two - photon four - mode state @xmath24 and sends half of the modes to alice and the other half to bob . for the sake of concreteness",
    "we assume that alice gets modes labeled 1 and 2 ( 1 through @xmath25 if @xmath2 modes are shared ) . as a result ,",
    "alice and bob share the state @xmath26 . upon receiving her part of the state",
    ", alice transforms her modes using one of the four ( or potentially more ) predetermined _ two - mode unitary _ transformations @xmath27 .",
    "she chooses which unitary operation @xmath28 to apply according to a probability distribution @xmath29 and does not disclose her choice to bob .",
    "next , alice sends her part of the state to bob who now has one of four possible two - photon four - mode states @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 .",
    "bob wants to learn which unitary transformation @xmath28 was performed by alice i.e. which state @xmath30 he has at hand . to do",
    "that he sends all four modes through a detection setup that performs a _ four - mode unitary _ transformation @xmath32 and measures the projection of the output state onto the two - photon four - mode fock basis states @xmath33 . using the outcome of the measurement bob tries to guess the index @xmath34 of the state that alice has sent .    in qubit - based communication protocols alice receives a single qubit ( i.e. photon ) from the source .",
    "the photon , depending on the encoding scheme , is distributed over two ( polarization or spatial ) modes .",
    "the local unitary operations @xmath27 that alice performs on her qubit do not change the total number of photons she communicates to bob .",
    "this provides an implicit constraint on the average number of photons used to communicate a single character i.e. @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are photon annihilation operators for alice s mode 1(2 ) and @xmath38 is the probability that alice performs an operation @xmath28 . in our qubit - less protocol",
    "the source can potentially provide a state @xmath26 that violates the constraint in eq.([eq : phnumconstr ] ) . to make our protocol comparable to dense coding with linear optics in terms of photonic resources needed to communicate a single character we ,",
    "therefore , explicitly require that the state provided by the source to alice and bob is such that it satisfies the photon number constraint in eq.([eq : phnumconstr ] ) .",
    "naturally , the best case scenario in terms of information transmission(assuming a noiseless quantum channel and perfect detectors ) for our protocol is when alice can prepare four orthogonal states @xmath30 subjected to constraints eq.([eq : phnumconstr ] ) and bob can unambiguously detect which state @xmath30 alice has sent him just by means of photon coincidence measurements . in this case , analogously to the original dense coding proposal  @xcite , alice and bob can communicate two bits of information ( provided @xmath39 ) by sending on average one photon in just two modes instead of four .",
    "however , whether such states @xmath30 ( equivalently a state @xmath26 and two - mode unitaries @xmath28 ) exist is an open question . also ,",
    "to conclude that our protocol is indeed of a dense coding type , we need to determine the largest amount of classical information that alice and bob can share by utilizing at most two single photons and two modes under the constraint eq.([eq : phnumconstr ] ) . only if the latter is less than @xmath40 our protocol demonstrates an information gain . to answer these questions we need to formulate the problem in terms of communication channel capacity determination .",
    "from the information - theoretical perspective alice and bob form a two - mode two - photon communication system with two auxiliary modes in which alice encodes each letter of her message using a two - bit alphabet @xmath41 with probability @xmath42 .",
    "the receiver , bob , detects the message sent by alice as a collection of random signals from the set @xmath43 with the conditional probability @xmath44 and applies a decoding rule to estimate the original message .",
    "note that @xmath45 is a function of the initial state @xmath26 , alice s unitary operations @xmath27 and bob s detection setup @xmath32 . in this context , finding the highest rate ( in bits ) at which information can be sent from alice to bob is equivalent to determining information channel capacity of the alice - bob system .",
    "the information channel capacity @xmath46 of alice - bob channel is defined as  @xcite , @xmath47 where the maximization is performed over all possible input distributions @xmath48 , states @xmath26 , unitary mode transformations @xmath28 , @xmath32 and is subjected to the constraint in eq.([eq : phnumconstr ] ) ; @xmath49 is the mutual information , @xmath50 here @xmath51 denotes the joint probability of alice preparing the state @xmath52 and bob detecting the state @xmath53 .",
    "the marginal probability @xmath54 is defined as @xmath55 .    by definition ,",
    "the mutual information @xmath56 is a concave function of @xmath48 ( 3 independent real - valued parameters ) and a non - concave function of the unitary mode transformation matrices @xmath57 ( 16 real - valued parameters ) , and @xmath58 ( 15 independent real - valued parameters ) and the input state @xmath26 that we parametrize using ten complex parameters @xmath59 ( 18 independent real - valued parameters   are independent because of the normalization constraint @xmath60 and one of the phases can be set to @xmath61 ) as @xmath62 .",
    "we can always set one of the matrices @xmath28 to be the identity @xmath63 matrix which will leave us with only three independent @xmath64 unitary matrices .",
    "therefore , the total number of real - valued optimization parameters in eq.([eq : cc ] ) is 48 .",
    "since we set alice s alphabet to only four letters , the global maximum of the channel capacity @xmath46 over all possible physical setup parameters can not in principle exceed @xmath65 bits .",
    "this follows form the definition of the mutual information in eq.([eq : mi ] ) .",
    "we observe that for any two random variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes shannon entropy  @xcite . since @xmath70 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath71 is achieved when @xmath72 is maximal ( @xmath73 ) and @xmath74 is minimal ( = 0 ) i.e. @xmath75 .",
    "however , it is not clear if this bound is physically attainable .",
    "also , due to the non - concave nature of the optimization objective function many local maximums may exist .",
    "of course , when optimizing @xmath76 numerically we are interested in finding a supremum of all local maximums and hope that it is @xmath77 bits .",
    "note that because @xmath49 is concave in parameters @xmath48 , if the global ( @xmath77 bits ) maximum is attained , using the preceding argument one can immediately show that the only possible values of @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , we can further reduce the number of real optimization parameters to 45 by setting @xmath79 .    .resource overview for the proposed entanglement - assisted protocol and conventional dense coding with photonic qubits [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we conclude this section by providing an overview of the resource requirements for our entanglement - assisted communication protocol as well as for the photon - based dense coding protocol in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the only difference between the protocols comes from the number of photons that alice communicates to bob . in our protocol",
    "this number is one on average . whereas in the dense coding protocol",
    "alice always sends bob one photon .",
    "this requirement also restricts a class of resource - equivalent entanglement - free protocols to those that use one photon on average .",
    "first , to test our approach , we solved the optimization problem in eq.([eq : cc ] ) using a fixed state @xmath26 provided by the source .",
    "we set @xmath26 to be equal to one of the bell states ( it does not matter which bell state is selected , optimization works equally well for all of them ) and found by numerical optimization that in this case @xmath80 . moreover , alice s mode transformation matrices that correspond to this solution are the same as the ones originally proposed by bennett and wiesner  @xcite .",
    "it means that by setting the initial state to a bell state the conventional bell state - based dense coding protocol  @xcite is recovered .",
    "next , we have discovered , by using gradient - based optimization methods , that the global maximum ( @xmath81 ) is indeed achievable in @xmath19 .",
    "the structure of globally optimal solutions encountered in our numerical search can be parametrized as follows .",
    "all globally optimal input states @xmath26 prepared by the source are , up to a swap of any two modes , equivalent to the state , @xmath82 for example , the following input state @xmath83 obtained from @xmath26 by swapping modes @xmath77 and @xmath84 also leads to the globally optimal solution with @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 in eq.([eq : inst ] ) also defines a class of globally optimal input states that are equivalent to @xmath26 up to a four - mode unitary transformation : @xmath85 where @xmath86 are arbitrary unitary matrices @xmath87 , @xmath88 and parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 are arbitrary angles @xmath91 $ ]",
    ".    given matrices @xmath92 and @xmath93 , alice s globally optimal mode transformation matrices ( acting on modes 1 and 2 ) can be decomposed as @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , where @xmath92 is defined in eq.([eq : ua ] ) , @xmath98 is an arbitrary @xmath99 unitary matrix @xmath87 with a similar parametrization and @xmath100 denoted pauli sigma @xmath101 matrix .",
    "lastly , bob s four - mode transformation matrix @xmath32 can be represented as follows , @xmath102 implementing this mode transformation matrix in an experiment , bob will detect four distinct coincidence patterns : a coincidence between detectors in modes @xmath103 and @xmath77 correspond to alice s choice @xmath104 , modes @xmath77 and @xmath84 correspond to @xmath105 , modes @xmath84 and @xmath106 correspond to @xmath107 , modes @xmath103 and @xmath106 correspond to @xmath108 .",
    "we remark that this outcome mapping is not unique .",
    "other choices of coincidence assignment are possible and can be realized by additional four - mode unitary rotation on bob s end i.e. @xmath109 .    we emphasize that @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath32 define globally optimal unitary _ mode _ transformation .",
    "the result of their action on the input state @xmath26 can be determined in the following fashion .",
    "let us denote input mode photon creation operators as @xmath112 , then , @xmath113 is a four - mode vacuum state .",
    "consider first the unitary mode operation @xmath110 defined earlier .",
    "it acts on the creation operators @xmath114 as a linear transform i.e. @xmath115 , where @xmath116 are the matrix elements of @xmath110 . as a result , the input state @xmath26 in eq.([eq : polyinstate ] )",
    "is transformed to @xmath117a^{\\dagger}_{i}a^{\\dagger}_{j})|0\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , unitary mode transformations @xmath111 and @xmath32 can now be applied to the state @xmath118 in eq.([eq : polyinstatetranformed ] ) in sequence , resulting in the desired output state at bob s detectors .",
    "the structure of the globally optimal solution is most transparent when @xmath119 . in this case",
    "the physical setup that implements our communication protocol is illustrated in fig.([fig : physicalsetup ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , its structure is equivalent to a double mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the source prepares the state @xmath26 in eq.([eq : inst ] ) by placing a separable state containing two single photons in modes @xmath103 and @xmath77 i.e. @xmath120 onto two @xmath121 beam splitters coupling modes ( @xmath103,@xmath84 ) and ( @xmath77,@xmath106 ) . to transform her two modes",
    ", alice needs only @xmath122 phase shifters .",
    "note that the transformation @xmath107 applies a phase shift to both alice s modes with respect to bob s modes .",
    "bob recombines modes ( @xmath103,@xmath84 ) and ( @xmath77,@xmath106 ) on two @xmath121 beam splitters and sends them for the coincidence detection . in the case of noiseless channel and perfect detectors",
    "this converts the states @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 which results in the channel capacity @xmath127 .",
    "also note that photon number resolving detectors are not required by bob since he relies on a coincidence detection .",
    "let us now calculate the channel capacity for the case when alice and bob do not share any entanglement in order to determine whether our entanglement - assisted protocol provides any advantage for information transmission purposes . for",
    "that we consider the following resource - equivalent scenario : alice prepares a _ two - mode _ state @xmath128 , corresponding to a character from a @xmath129-letter alphabet @xmath66 ( @xmath129 is to be determined later ) , with probability @xmath130 and sends it to bob who can perform an arbitrary _ two - mode _ unitary transformation @xmath131 before he detects the received state using two photo detectors that are _ not _ number resolving ( because the correspondent entanglement - based protocol does not require photon - number - resolving detectors ) .    to facilitate a fair comparison between the entanglement - free and entanglement - assisted protocols ,",
    "we assume that alice s resources per character are limited to at most _ two single photons _ and she may use only linear optical elements(i.e .",
    "only two - mode unitary operations ) to prepare states @xmath132 . in this case , inputs to alice s state preparation setup are limited to @xmath133 .",
    "linear optical operations that alice may perform to prepare states @xmath132 conserve the total number of photons and , thus , @xmath132 can not be a superposition of states with different total photon numbers such as , for instance , @xmath134 or @xmath135 , etc . also , the states @xmath132 must be mutually orthogonal . if they are not , bob will be forced to discriminate between non - orthogonal states since he can only apply a two - mode unitary transformation ( unitary transformations do not change the overlap between the states @xmath132 ) to all states he receives .",
    "this will effectively reduce the amount of information that bob and alice can exchange and make such a communication protocol suboptimal .",
    "the subspaces that contain states with different total number of photons are orthogonal and we only need to determine how many orthogonal states can be created by alice in each subspace by means of a two - mode unitary transform .",
    "the subspace spanned by vacuum @xmath136 is invariant under two - mode unitary transforms and alice can use @xmath136 as @xmath137 .",
    "the one - photon subspace spanned by @xmath14 and @xmath15 trivially contains two orthogonal states e.g. @xmath138 that can be generated using a 50/50 beamsplitter . finally , it is straightforward to show that only one state orthogonal to @xmath139 can be generated by two - mode unitary operations in the two - photon subspace .",
    "hence , alice can choose @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this implies that alice may prepare up to @xmath142 mutually orthogonal states by using linear optical elements .",
    "we now can calculate the channel capacity for the above choice of the states @xmath143 , maximizing the mutual information function over bob s unitary transformation @xmath131 and probabilities @xmath144 , subjected to the average photon number constraint in eq.([eq : phnumconstr ] ) which for this case reads , @xmath145 we found , by solving the optimization task numerically , that bob s optimal transformation is a 50/50 beam splitter and the channel capacity in this case amounts to 2 @xmath6 .",
    "the optimal values for @xmath146 s are @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , alice can equivalently ( up to a two - mode unitary transformation ) use the following set of states to encode her message : @xmath148 this is because bob s detectors are not number resolving , and he can not discriminate a single photon event from a two - photon event . therefore , even if alice can prepare five mutually orthogonal states the amount of information that bob can extract from them is the same as if alice used the four state alphabet in eq.([eq : aset ] ) .    at first sight one may conclude that if bob has ideal(100@xmath149 efficient ) detectors and additional synchronization information to distinguish the vacuum signal @xmath136 from no signal events , he could discriminate the states @xmath132 in eq.([eq : aset ] ) perfectly which implies that the channel capacity of the entanglement - free protocol is also 2 @xmath6 .",
    "however , if the vacuum detection is ruled out , it would further reduce the set @xmath150 to only three states i.e. @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , by combining eq.([eq : meanphconstr ] ) with the normalization condition @xmath152 and setting @xmath153 we immediately derive that @xmath154 .",
    "so effectively this becomes a two - mode two - state(@xmath155 ) protocol with the channel capacity of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , under the condition of no vacuum detection , our entanglement - based protocol allows one to communicate one extra bit of information when compared to the best possible entanglement - free two - mode communication scheme .",
    "lastly , let us consider what happens when the vacuum detection is allowed but bob s detectors are non - ideal .",
    "we show in appendix  [ appendix ] that in this case the difference in the channel capacity of the proposed entanglement - based protocol and its resource - equivalent entanglement - free analogue discussed earlier in this subsection is a positive function of the detection efficiency ( see fig.([fig : channelcapacitydifference ] ) for details ) .",
    "thus , we show that for realistic detectors our entanglement - based protocol always allows transmission of more information then its entanglement - free version with the same amount of resources used .",
    "next , let us study how much information can be communicated in our entanglement - assisted protocol by sending less than one photon on average .",
    "this can be readily done by modifying the optimization constraint in eq.([eq : phnumconstr ] ) .",
    "note that , since alice only uses passive optical elements , the average number of photons she sends to bob is actually controlled by the source i.e. @xmath156 where @xmath157 denote photon annihilation operators for alice s modes @xmath158 .",
    "thus , the new optimization problem at hand is , @xmath159        where @xmath160 is a constant @xmath161 $ ] .",
    "we used a gradient - based solver to optimize eq.([eq : ccplusconstraint ] ) numerically for various values of the average photon number @xmath160 . for a fixed value of @xmath162 we ran 500 independent optimizations using random starting points .",
    "we then selected the largest value of @xmath163 over these runs and used it as a starting point for optimizing @xmath76 for the next value of @xmath164 . by gradually varying the constraint value we calculated @xmath163 as a function of @xmath160 depicted in fig.([fig : lcapacityvsphotons ] ) .",
    "we observe that if alice sends bob less then one photon on average then their channel capacity falls below two bits .",
    "however , they can achieve channel capacity @xmath165 ( the best value demonstrated to date  @xcite ) by communicating @xmath166 photons on average .      in principle",
    ", alice may want to use larger alphabets than just the four - symbol one .",
    "after all , we are operating with the states in @xmath19 and naturally the question arises whether a physical setup exists that attains the channel capacity @xmath167 for some integer @xmath168 $ ] . to answer this question we modified our protocol by allowing alice to perform @xmath169 unitary transformations on her two modes . at the same time",
    "we still require bob to measure in the fock basis @xmath170 .",

    "we study two simple extensions with two photons ( @xmath23 ) distributed over @xmath10 and @xmath11 modes .",
    "we assume that in both cases alice and bob receive @xmath174 modes from the source .",
    "our goal is again to solve numerically the channel capacity problem posed in eq.([eq : cc ] ) .    for the @xmath23 , @xmath10 case the dimensionality of the correspondent hilbert space is @xmath175 which naturally leads to the question :",
    "is it possible to design an entanglement - assisted communication scheme that provides channel capacity of @xmath176 by sending just three modes from alice to bob ?",
    "the necessary condition for that is alice must be able to prepare @xmath177 orthogonal states from an input state @xmath26 by means of `` local '' three - mode unitary transformations .",
    "however , we discovered numerically that alice can at best prepare @xmath178 orthogonal states using three - mode unitary transformations .",
    "this means that the channel capacity can not possibly exceed @xmath179 .",
    "next , we numerically solved the optimization task in a modified version of eq.([eq : cc ] ) for the case of @xmath180 local @xmath181 operations performed by alice and one global @xmath182 mode transformation performed by bob .",
    "obtained solutions suggest @xmath183 which implies that even if alice can locally prepare 12 orthogonal states , bob can not discriminate then deterministically by means of linear optics and coincidence detection .",
    "indeed , we discovered that bob can only perform a non - ambiguous detection of 8 orthogonal states encoded by alice .",
    "therefore , the practical(achievable ) channel capacity in the case of @xmath23 photons in @xmath10 modes is limited to @xmath184 .",
    "this result was obtained using an unconstrained optimization of the mutual information function . the actual mean number of photons per character in this scheme is @xmath185 photons",
    ". correspondent entanglement - free three - mode communication schemes with the same photon - per - character cost are equivalent to a six state protocol where alice sends states @xmath186 which results in the channel capacity of @xmath187(assuming perfect detectors and no vacuum detection constraint ) .",
    "therefore , the information gain in the @xmath23 photon , @xmath10 modes dense coding scheme is @xmath188 .",
    "similar analysis for the case of @xmath23 photons in @xmath11 modes revealed that the practical channel capacity of the eight - mode communication is limited to @xmath179 ( compare to the four - mode entanglement - free channel capacity of @xmath189 ) .",
    "we discussed the problem of entanglement - assisted communication channel capacity gain for a linear optical circuit with @xmath2 modes populated by @xmath160 photons .",
    "we discovered in the case of @xmath22 , @xmath23 there is a class of mode - entangled states that supports protocols with a range of channel capacity gain over corresponding resource - equivalent entanglement - free protocols .",

    "we define the conditional probability @xmath196 for the detector to click erroneously when the input state was @xmath193 and the probability @xmath197 for the `` no click '' event when the input contained a photon .",
    "note that for imperfect detectors `` no click''(``click '' ) does not necessary imply that the input state was zero(one ) photon .    assuming that states @xmath193 and @xmath195 have equal probabilities of arriving at the detector i.e. @xmath198",
    "let us calculate the probability @xmath199 of the vacuum state arriving at the detector provided a  no click ",

    "such a disparity in detection efficiency suggests that linear optical schemes that rely on double vacuum detection will experience a more severe channel capacity reduction than coincidence - based schemes .    with the previous discussion in mind ,",

    ", @xmath232 is a function of only two independent parameters e.g. @xmath233 and @xmath234 ( @xmath235 and @xmath236 can be expressed in terms of @xmath233 and @xmath234 using eq.([eq : meanphconstr ] ) and probability normalization ) and maximizing it numerically gives the channel capacity @xmath237 for the entanglement - free communication scheme . in a similar fashion",
    "we can compute the channel capacity for the entanglement - assisted protocol . in this case",
    "alice prepares one of the four states from the set @xmath238 defined in section  [ sec : method ] and bob registers one of 16 possible four - mode click patterns @xmath239 .",
    "the mutual information @xmath71 can now be calculated by extending the summation range over @xmath226 from 4 to 16 in eq.([eq : mi2modes ] ) and introducing a correspondent @xmath240 join probability matrix @xmath223 .",
    "note that unlike in the entanglement - free protocol now @xmath71 depends on three parameters @xmath241 for a fixed value of @xmath231 and @xmath207 .",
    "the final algebraic expression can be optimized numerically to find the channel capacity of the entanglement - assisted protocol @xmath242 .",
    "we have obtained values of @xmath243 numerically by using a random search method on a set of @xmath244 randomly generated probability distributions @xmath245 for various values of the single photon detection probability @xmath231 and @xmath246 .",
