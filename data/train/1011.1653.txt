    ". the interaction of the jet with the ambient in fri and frii galaxies could be important to the extent that agn feedback has been claimed to be a possible solution for the cooling flow problem via shock - heating or mixing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "also , this interaction can give rise to heating and particle acceleration via shocks , in which thermal and non - thermal radiation is produced and can be used to study the properties of the flow and the medium .",

    "@xcite performed a series of simulations of supersonic and underdense jets in a decreasing pressure atmosphere and showed that jets evolve in two different phases regarding their high - energy thermal emission : a phase in which the shell formed by shocked material is highly overpressured and radiative , and a later phase in which the shock is weaker and a deficit of x - ray emission is expected from the lobes .",

    "however , deeper observations of cen  a @xcite showed that the emission from a bow - shock region around the south - west lobe is better interpreted as of synchrotron origin , implying that the shock is strong enough to accelerate particles up to lorentz factors of @xmath3 . in other sources , like the radio galaxy fornax  a , the lobes seem to emit non - thermal x - rays through inverse compton ( ic ) of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite ( pm07 hereafter ) performed a simulation aimed to test the fri jet evolution paradigm @xcite and the model by @xcite for the fri jet of the radiogalaxy 3c  31 . the simulation was done using a numerical code for relativistic hydrodynamics , based on high - resolution - shock - capturing schemes , to which it was added an equation of state that allows for a specific treatment of two families of particles , leptons and baryons , and computes the adiabatic index in terms of the composition of each cell .",

    "the model adopted here to study the non - thermal emission of the termination site of an fri jet has been adapted from @xcite , in which the non - thermal radiation of a microquasar jet termination region was studied . in that paper , the dynamics was based on the works by @xcite and @xcite , whereas here the dynamics has been extracted from the simulations by pm07 . the thermal emission has been computed using the information on the density and temperature obtained from these simulations . for details on the properties of the jet at injection and the external medium , we address to tables  1 and 2 in pm07 ( see also table 3 of the same work for a comparison with cen  a and the radiogalaxy ngc  3801 ) . since in the present case the jet is disrupted and a strong reverse shock is not produced ( unlike in @xcite ) , the shock in the jet ( reverse shock ) has not been considered .",
    "instead , we have accounted for the strong recollimation shock as the particle accelerator in the cocoon . for illustrative purposes , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim1 ] a density map , with isobars , of the simulated jet after @xmath17  yr of evolution ( see pm07 ) .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim1 ] shows a zoomed view of the head of the jet .",
    "most of the accelerated electrons do not cool down significantly before overcoming the jet disruption point ( dp ) and reach later on the turbulent cocoon .",
    "this is due to the fast motion downstream the recollimation shock , which efficiently carries particles away along the jet axis down to the dp .",
    "also , the compression of the shocked jet walls by the cocoon material prevents expansion and therefore adiabatic cooling until electrons reach the dp . beyond that point ,",
    "relativistic electrons spread in the cocoon via turbulent advection and diffusion .",
    "since the material becomes trans- or subsonic after the recollimation shock , the pressure in the shocked jet , the cocoon and the shell should be relatively similar , the shell being denser but colder than the cocoon .",
    "in addition , the dominant photon field is the ( homogeneous ) cmb one , with radiation energy density @xmath18  erg  @xmath19 ( we use @xmath20 in our calculations ) , provided that the emitter is located at a distance @xmath21  kpc from the galaxy nucleus ( @xmath22 is the nucleus luminosity ) .",
    "this allows us , at this stage , to simplify the cocoon region as an emitter with homogeneous properties ( one zone ) with the recollimation shock as the injector of accelerated particles . the external medium shocked by the bow shock , i.e. the shell , should be also mostly subsonic , and the same considerations regarding the photon field apply there .",
    "therefore , we have also adopted an homogeneous emitter approximation for the shell .    in both the shell and the cocoon ,",
    "the luminosity injected in the form of non - thermal particles has been taken as a 10% of the total jet kinetic luminosity , i.e. @xmath23  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath24 has been fixed taking the magnetic energy density , @xmath25 , to be 10% of the ram / thermal pressure .",
    "concerning particle acceleration , the recollimation shock has been assumed to be relativistic , with an acceleration rate @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "for the bow shock , we have adopted the expression for a non - relativistic shock , in which @xmath28 ( e.g. drury 1983 ) , where @xmath29 is the bow - shock velocity ( typically here of @xmath30  cm  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "these acceleration rates are to be compared to the synchrotron and ic loss rates ( e.g. @xcite ) to derive the maximum energy of electrons .",
    "the cooling timescales ( @xmath31 ) of synchrotron and ( thomson ) ic processes are : @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , being @xmath34 the total radiation energy density .",
    "an escape time has also to been considered since particles with enough energy would escape the accelerator .",
    "this is derived by taking the gyroradius of the most energetic particles equal to the size of the accelerator , i.e. the recollimation and bow - shock widths ( hillas 1984 ) .",
    "we do not consider the possible role of fermi  ii stochastic or shear acceleration in the disrupted jet and cocoon regions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite for a deeper analysis of fermi  ii particle acceleration in the context of the lobes of cen  a ) , although these processes may be _ absorbed _ by our phenomenological treatment of the particle acceleration in the cocoon .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the properties of the non - thermal emitters in the cocoon and the shell are characterized by the ram / thermal pressure and the bow - shock velocity ( and the shock sizes when cooling is unefficient ) , which determine the magnetic field , the synchrotron emission , indirectly the ic emission , and the acceleration efficiency .",
    "these conditions have been parameterized making use of the results of the simulations of pm07 and their extrapolation to earlier and later times , covering an age range @xmath35  yr .",
    "we do not expect significant uncertainties from the extrapolations as long as the medium properties present the same properties at larger distances than those covered by the simulated jet .",
    "some of the model parameters are listed in table  [ tab : model ] for both the shell and the cocoon regions .",
    "the spectral aging of the non - thermal particle populations has been modeled considering the evolution of the physical conditions in each interaction region .",
    "the particle energy distribution at a given time , @xmath36 , is calculated by adding the different evolved injected populations , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , from @xmath39 up to @xmath40 .",
    "the time resolution of particle injection is @xmath41 .",
    "maximum particle energies , @xmath42 , are also computed for each time step due to the time dependence of the magnetic field , the accelerator size and the shock velocity . for simplicity , a spectral index @xmath43 has been used in our calculations for both the recollimation and the bow shock .",
    "we note that , together with synchrotron and ic cooling , the expansion of the jet termination structure introduces an adiabatic loss timescale ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the size of the whole structure .",
    "in addition to synchrotron and ic processes , relativistic bremsstrahlung @xcite could also take place in the shell , and protons may be accelerated and eventually could interact with the shocked jet medium through proton - proton ( @xmath46 ) collisions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the densities @xmath47 of targets for relativistic bremsstrahlung and @xmath46 emission in the shell , the largest in the jet termination region , are low , and the cooling timescales :",
    "@xmath48    this implies radiation efficiencies much smaller than those of synchrotron and ic .",
    "in addition , it is worth noting that synchrotron proton emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , under equipartition magnetic fields , could overcome ic radiation around 100  mev , although only for very young sources ( @xmath49  yr ) this component may be significant .",
    "we do not further consider either relativistic bremsstrahlung or proton radiation processes in this work .",
    "the thermal emission has been computed making use of the simulation results and their extrapolation to the @xmath50-range considered here . given the strong density dependence of thermal bremsstrahlung",
    ", we have only accounted for the contribution from the shell , much denser than the cocoon .",
    "furthermore , we have simplified the calculations of the thermal radiation as it would be coming from two regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sim1 ] ) .",
    "one , cooler ( ultraviolet -uv-/soft x - rays ) but brighter , corresponds to the averaged shell conditions ( @xmath51 ) , and another one , fainter but hotter ( hard x - rays ) , corresponds to a region close to the apex of the bow shock ( @xmath52 ) , in which the shell has properties close to those given by the jump conditions of rankine - hugoniot .",
    "the volume of the latter region is about @xmath53% of that of the whole shell ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : sim1 ] ) , which corresponds to the volume limited by the isobars satisfying @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the shell pressure right behind the bow shock and corresponds to the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions .",
    "given the high temperatures in the shell , we have calculated the thermal bremsstrahlung assuming that the plasma is fully ionized , with electrons and protons in equipartition . at this stage , we have not considered line emission .",
    "we have studied the thermal and non - thermal emission produced in the shell and the cocoon separately .",
    "we consider here the contribution from a single fri jet , so the predicted luminosities should be scaled by a factor of two to obtain the whole source emission under similar ambient conditions for jet and counter - jet .",
    "the bow shock can accelerate electrons up to energies @xmath56  tev ( @xmath57  yr ) to @xmath58  tev at ( @xmath59  yr ) , and is limited by synchrotron losses at any time .",
    "this trend of higher @xmath60 for older sources comes from the energy gain to loss ratio @xmath61 under synchrotron dominance .",
    "since @xmath62 decreases moderately , from @xmath63 to @xmath64  cm  s@xmath12 , the strongest variation in the shell acceleration rate comes from the @xmath24-evolution , which goes from @xmath65 ( @xmath57  yr ) to @xmath66  g ( @xmath59  yr ) . the shell ic emission is dominated by scatterings with cmb photons . in the cocoon region , we have assumed the recollimation shock to be the accelerator site .",
    "the maximum energy also grows here , going from @xmath67 to @xmath68  tev .",
    "since @xmath69 is proportional to the pressure and the latter is similar in the cocoon and the shell ( see figs .  5 and 6 in pm07 ) , @xmath24 is also similar in both regions . as in the shell ,",
    "synchrotron losses dominate for the magnetic field strengths and ages considered here .",
    "the high values of @xmath60 in the recollimation shock are expected since the acceleration rate is assumed to be @xmath70 times more efficient here than in the non - relativistic bow shock .",
    "the large distance of the recollimation shock to the galaxy nucleus makes the cmb ic to dominate over other ic components , although for very young sources the galaxy nucleus could be relevant .    the non - thermal spectral energy distributions ( sed ) for the cocoon and the shell , at @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath59  yr , are shown in fig .",

    "the obtained radio and x - ray synchrotron luminosities in both regions are at the level of @xmath73  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "the approximate constancy of the luminosities with time is due to the fact that particles have reached the steady state at @xmath40 through synchrotron cooling of the particle energy after a time @xmath74 , the rest of the energy going to radiation . ] and the assumed constancy of @xmath75 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath24 with time , and therefore the growth of @xmath76 , is compensated by the increase of time available for cooling .",
    "the synchrotron break frequency , corresponding to the electron energy at which @xmath77 , and the highest synchrotron frequency , @xmath78 , are shifted down for older sources .",
    "the former effect makes the radio luminosity to increase at the late stages of the evolution of both the cocoon and the shell , whereas the latter decreases the x - ray luminosity in the shell due to the decrease of @xmath79 with time .",
    "the slightly different conditions in the shell yield a higher break frequency , which implies a factor @xmath80 lower radio luminosity in this region compared to that of the cocoon .",
    "the ic luminosity grows as long as this process becomes more efficient compared to synchrotron and adiabatic cooling , which is shown by the decrease of @xmath81 from @xmath82 ( @xmath83  yr ) to 4 ( @xmath59  yr ) .",
    "as expected from the @xmath60-values given above and the similar energy budget , the cocoon and the shell have similar he luminosities , but the cocoon is few times brighter at vhe than the shell due to its much higher maximum frequency . in both regions",

    "the lightcurves show in more detail the time behavior of the non - thermal radiation at different wavelengths discussed above .",
    "the complex and smooth shape of the lightcurves , most clear for the he and the vhe emission , is a consequence of the complex hydrodynamical evolution of the whole interaction structure propagating in an inhomogeneous external medium .          as mentioned in sect .",

    "the slowdown of the bow shock and the velocity dependence of the postshock temperature , @xmath86 , leads to a decrease in the peak of the thermal emission with time , whereas the increase of the shell mass yields higher thermal bolometric luminosities as the source gets older .",

    "thermal x - rays are produced in the shell , with a temporal evolution smoother and more complex than in the case of a homogeneous medium .",
    "the existence of different emitting regions in the shell would lead to a relatively flat thermal spectrum in x - rays , with a bolometric flux from @xmath107mpc@xmath97 ( @xmath83  yr ) to few times @xmath108mpc@xmath97  erg  @xmath98  s@xmath12 ( @xmath95  yr ) .",

    "we also note that given the moderate velocities of the bow shock , thermal photons can not reach energies as high as those discussed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for the shell properties considered in this work , the thermal cooling time - scale @xmath111  yr is greater than @xmath40 . assuming that the bow shock keeps being adiabatic and strong all along the source age , and hence not displaying a transition to a much weaker shock regime ( see e.g. zanni et al .",

    "this difference could be explained by a higher @xmath60 in the shell of that source .",
    "in addition , a relatively recent decrease in jet power would have affected first the cocoon synchrotron emission , making this radiation fainter while the shell emission would remain at similar levels for a time @xmath113  yr .",
    "the lifetime of x - ray synchrotron electrons , @xmath114 , is much shorter than in radio , and @xmath115 as well .",
    "this implies that these particles may not have time to reach the whole emitting structures , and their radiation may come mostly from the inner regions of the cocoon or the bow - shock apex .",
    "note that this may lead to a violation of the assumption of an homogeneous emitter .",
    "this x - ray synchrotron emission concentrated around the recollimation shock is compatible with the large - scale jet x - ray emission found in 3c  31 by @xcite .",
    "if a strong recollimation shock is indeed the origin of these large - scale jet x - rays , then the hypothesis that jet disruption in 3c  31 is caused by shock triggered instabilities is favored against stellar wind mass - load ( as proposed by @xcite ; see also pm07 ) .",

    "[ intro ] , the extended emission in some fri jets has been interpreted as ic instead of synchrotron emission . as shown for instance in fig .  5 of @xcite for fornax  a , in some cases the x - ray emission is difficult to reconcile with a synchrotron origin .",
    "we note however that the predicted ic x - ray spectra ( fig .",
    "[ nonthermal_sed ] ) would appear similar to the one shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , for sources older than those considered here and/or lower @xmath24-values , in which synchrotron emission would be less relevant , cocoon and shell ic would dominate the x - ray output ( covering roughly the whole cocoon / shell structure given the long cooling timescales of ic x - ray electrons ) .",
    "we remind that the complex medium of the turbulent cocoon region , not treated here , may enhance the x - rays in certain compact regions .",
    "much lower surface brightness could prevent the detection of the more diffuse x - rays coming from larger regions of the cocoon .",
    "x - ray emitting electrons may also lose a significant fraction of their energy right after the recollimation shock .",
    "given the transrelativistic velocities in that region , doppler boosting would beam the emission favoring certain viewing angles .",
    "this effect has not been accounted for in the present study .",
    "finally , we remark that thermal emission seems unavoidable given the medium densities and bow - shock temperatures , whereas ic depends on @xmath75 , as well as synchrotron , which also depends on @xmath24 , none of these two parameters being well determined .",

    "actually , _ fermi _ has already detected several fri galaxies up to few hundred mpc distances @xcite , including the extended radio lobes of cen  a ( at a distance @xmath122  mpc ; @xcite ) , presenting fluxes similar to those predicted here . at vhe",
    ", the fluxes would be detectable by the current instruments , although the extension of the source , of tens of arcminute at 100  mpc , and the steepness of the spectrum above @xmath123  gev , may make a detection difficult . in the case of cen",
    "a , detected by hess @xcite , the emission seems to come only from the core , but this is expected given the large angular size of the lobes of this source , which would dilute its surface brightness too much .",
    "in general , long exposures with present cherenkov instruments , like hess , magic ii and veritas , and the forthcoming cta , may allow the detection of vhe emission from fri jet lobes , and possibly carry out energy - dependent morphological studies .",
    "we have applied a radiative model to a prototypical fri jet characterizing the flow with the results of hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung ( x - rays ) , and non - thermal synchrotron ( radio - x - rays ) and cmb ic ( x - rays - gamma - rays ) have been considered as the emission mechanisms .    from our study we conclude that , for moderate non - thermal luminosities , radio lobes of fri radio galaxies are good candidates to be detected in the whole spectral range , with the radiation appearing extended in most of the energy bands",
    ". the precise extension of the emitting regions is hard to calculate , and may depend e.g. on the source distance , the instrument resolution and the capability to disentangle the non - thermal emission from the background contribution .",
    "our study does not aim to provide specific values of the source extension at different energies , and offers only rough estimates of the overall emission morphology .",
    "our results show that soft x - rays may be likely dominated by synchrotron emission up to ages @xmath3  yr , with ic tending to be dominant for older sources .",
    "thermal x - rays seem unavoidable and may dominate in hard x - rays in old sources even if a non - thermal component is present . the low surface brightness may require long observation times for the detection in x- and gamma - rays , although the steady nature of these sources can help in this regard .",
    "moderate resolution radio and x - ray data , with long enough exposures , can allow the direct comparison between predictions of simulations and observational data , thus giving clues on the hydrodynamics of the present flows and their surroundings . also , any nearby galaxy of this kind can be a suitable candidate for an eventual gamma - ray detection .",
    "non - thermal synchrotron x - rays and he and vhe gamma - rays provide suitable information to study particle acceleration in the jet termination regions .",
