    "the kondo problem of multiple impurities has attracted much attention since the pioneering work of the two - impurity system about 25 years ago.@xcite the presence of two competing energy scales , the kondo temperature and the intersite exchange interaction , provides a nice play ground of quantum phase transition at zero temperature . around the quantum critical point ,",
    "non fermi liquid ( nfl ) behaviors emerge and thermodynamic quantities and their dynamics exhibit singular temperature dependence .",
    "these physics have a connection to quantum criticality in heavy fermion systems@xcite and , thus , understanding much simpler cluster problems is a key to capturing the nature of more complicated problems .    quantum fluctuations in such strongly correlated systems can be controlled by tuning geometrical frustration .",
    "this is the case not only in spin systems but also in itinerant electron systems and the frustration leads to novel ground states such as spin liquid states.@xcite as for the kondo problem , frustration can be implemented by introducing a cluster of multiple impurities , and also controlling its geometry .",

    "this phase is stable against perturbations that keep the triangular symmetry such as magnetic fields and particle - hole asymmetry,@xcite which contrasts with the unstable nfl in the two - impurity case.@xcite    this paper reports extensive analysis on a minimal three - dimensional cluster problem with geometrical frustration , the kondo problem of a regular tetrahedron .",

    "<S> we investigate a four - impurity anderson model where localized orbitals are located at vertices of a regular tetrahedron and find a novel fixed point in addition to the ordinary fermi liquid phase . that is characterized by unscreened scalar chirality of a tetrahedron . in this phase , </S>",
    "<S> parafermions emerges in the excitation spectrum and quasiparticle mass diverges as @xmath0 at low temperatures ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diverging effective mass is a manifestation of singular fermi liquid states as in the underscreened kondo problem . between the two phases , </S>",
    "<S> our monte carlo results show the existence of a non fermi liquid critical point where the kondo effects and the intersite antiferromagnetic interactions are valanced . </S>",
    "<S> singular behaviors are prominent in the dynamics and we find that the frequency dependence of the self - energy is the marginal fermi liquid like @xmath2 . </S>"
