    "hierarchical structure formation results in more massive dark matter halos assembling at late times .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". at @xmath8 , these massive halos , or high density environments , typically host more evolved galaxy populations .",
    "the morphological study of @xcite provided the first quantitative glimpse of this fact , finding elliptical and s0 , or early type galaxies , to dominate in high - density regions of clusters while spirals and irregulars , or late - types , dominate at lower densities .",
    "this morphology density relation ( mdr ) has also been found to extend to group environments at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these high density environments have continuously accreted galaxies from a range of lower density environments over time .",
    "thus , mass growth in such high density environments would lead galaxies within newly accreted halos at @xmath17 to undergo various transformations in their properties if the general environmental trends at @xmath8 hold out to these higher redshifts .",
    "in addition to morphology other galaxy properties such as rest - frame colors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and star formation rates ( sfrs , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have also been found to correlate with the local galaxy density at @xmath8 .",
    "large redshift surveys find such correlations in the field as well , indicating the importance of mechanisms that operate at halo mass scales below that of clusters in transforming galaxy properties at @xmath8 .",
    "in general the works above find red , quiescent , early - type galaxies represent a larger proportion of the population in higher density regions at @xmath8 such as the cores of groups and clusters , while blue , star - forming , late - type galaxies make up a larger share in lower density regions .    while several studies at @xmath8 have found the mean or median sfrs of galaxies to be lower at higher densities such as in groups and clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at higher redshifts the direction of this sfr - density trend has been the subject of debate . for luminosity - limited samples , @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that at @xmath17 the sfr - density relation reverses , such that galaxies at higher densities have higher sfrs .",
    "meanwhile , for a stellar mass - limited sample at @xmath18 , @xcite found the obscured sfr - density relation to decline at higher densities , much like at @xmath8 .",
    "the direction of the sfr - density trend at @xmath17 has implications for the effectiveness of the various physical processes that operate in different environments in regulating star formation ( sf ) and evolving galaxies .",
    "for example , a reversed sfr - density trend at @xmath17 would imply that the physical processes that lead to the shutdown of sf in high density group environments produce fewer red , non - star forming galaxies relative to a declining sfr - density relation .",
    "studying the origin of the sfr - density relation provides additional insight into the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of galaxies across a range of environments .",
    "for example , a declining sfr - density relation at a fixed stellar mass can be produced by either ( 1 ) the proportion of quiescent and star forming galaxies ( sfgs ) changing with density , ( 2 ) the sfrs of sfgs decreasing at higher densities , or ( 3 ) some combination of these two scenarios .",
    "the fraction of red and/or blue galaxies are often used to gauge scenario ( 1 ) above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , dusty sfgs can display red optical colors @xcite , thus complicating such measurements .",
    "with extinction in galaxies also dependent on environment @xcite , computing the fraction of quiescent and sfgs vs. local density from a single optical color is further complicated .",
    "thus , selecting sfgs , both the unobscured and obscured variety , is essential in determining the contribution of the three scenarios listed above in producing the sfr - density relation .    in this work ,",
    "we build on our analysis in @xcite in which we found declining obscured ssfr - density and sfr - density relations at a fixed stellar mass at @xmath19 . here , we expand the analysis with three different sfr indicators in order to confirm these declining relations found in @xcite .",
    "our sample in this work also spans a larger redshift range ( @xmath0 ) than in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath20 ) and encompasses galaxies in several groups and a cluster . as a consequence , we are able to determine how the sfrs of galaxies vary across a range of larger dark matter halos . finally , one of our primary goals in this work is to determine how the sfrs of individual galaxies change in order to produce the declining sfr - density relation . to this end",
    ", we employ a color - color diagram to distinguish quiescent and sfgs , as also utilized by several other recent works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in conducting this study , we primarily utilize stellar mass - limited samples as opposed to luminosity - limited samples .",
    "a limiting magnitude for a survey implies a limiting mass for old , quiescent galaxies that is generally higher than the limiting mass for young , sfgs at a given redshift ( see , e.g , appendix  [ app_masslimit ] ) . as a consequence , below the stellar mass limit implied by passive evolution of old systems ,",
    "no sample can be used to definitively characterize the average galaxy .",
    "this does not mean that the lower mass , blue sfgs found in luminosity - limited samples can not be used to study particular modes of star formation ( sf ) , but merely that such samples are not necessarily representative of the full population at low mass .",
    "these different selections can therefore lead to widely varying results .",
    "for example , in studying the mass - limited morphology - density relation ( mdr ) in clusters , @xcite found little evolution in the fraction of early - type galaxies at a fixed density between @xmath17 and @xmath8 ( see also , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an extension of this analysis to field densities also results in a similar conclusion @xcite .",
    "in contrast , previous results that utilized luminosity - limited samples found a significant buildup of early - type galaxies at late times , with the share of s0s growing at the expense of spirals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other galaxy properties correlate with stellar mass as well , such as optical colors @xcite , sfrs @xcite , and extinction @xcite . in drawing conclusions , it is therefore important to consider the distribution of stellar masses for different sub - samples that are being compared",

    "however , dust can lead to a significant fraction of sfgs occupying the red - sequence @xcite .",

    "the ssp model track passes near the quiescent clump after @xmath158  gyr , while the csf model track terminates at the blue end of where sfgs lie . the reddening vector in figure  [ bicolor]@xmath159 shows that sfgs are extended to redder colors with the addition of dust extinction .",
    "note that some of the reddest sfgs ( @xmath160  ab mag ) would have been classified as being `` red - and - dead '' based on @xmath9 colors alone .",
    "instead , these galaxies are distinct from the quiescent clump and are predicted to be sfgs with high values of a@xmath14 .",
    "bicolor diagrams , such as the @xmath118 ones shown here , can therefore be used to identify sfgs , including those that are reddened .      while the ssp and csf model tracks in figure",

    "[ bicolor]@xmath159 we also show how a variety of sfhs would appear in the @xmath118 diagram and emphasize the effectiveness of the @xcite boundary in distinguishing quiescent and sfgs .",
    "these examples also demonstrate that sfgs need not have formed the bulk of their mass recently in order to be classified as an sfg .",
    "even the slightest amount of recent sf can move formerly quiescent galaxies into the sfg region of the @xmath118 diagram .",
    "sfhs that proceed with several ongoing bursts have been suggested as a mode for galaxies to form a large fraction of their stellar mass , especially at these higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "the trajectories of various bursting sfhs are shown in figure  [ bicolor]@xmath159 as dashed lines .",
    "the green and cyan colored tracks show the evolution of a @xmath161 and @xmath162 burst ( by mass ) added to a @xmath163  gyr solar metallicity ssp at time steps after the burst , @xmath164 , of 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.3 , and 0.5  gyr ( time steps shown as squares ) . immediately after the burst ( i.e. , @xmath165  gyr ) , the @xmath9 colors become bluer then most sfgs in our sample .",
    "after @xmath166  gyr , the colors once again return to resemble a galaxy residing in the quiescent clump .",
    "this transition proceeds more quickly for the smaller @xmath161 burst .",

    "those red sfgs are most likely to be obscured at some level .    the orange track in figure  [ bicolor ]",
    "represents a @xmath161 burst added to an ssp but with the burst component extincted by a@xmath14@xmath167  mag .",
    "note the displacement from the unobscured @xmath161 burst ( green track ) .",
    "these dusty bursts spend even less time ( @xmath168  gyr ) classified as sfgs . depending on the level of extinction and the distribution of the dust",
    ", reddened bursts can populate the reddest colors for sfgs .    a galaxy with low levels of continuous sf , qualitatively resembling the state of the milky way , is represented by the single yellow star at @xmath169  ab mag and @xmath170  ab mag .",
    "this sfh is a combination of a csf that has been ongoing for the last 1  gyr and an ssp of age 4  gyr .",
    "the csf component has produced @xmath162 of the total mass .",
    "such low levels of continuous sf would place a galaxy in the region occupied by sfgs .",
    "sfhs with sfrs that slowly decline with time can lead to galaxies being classified as sfgs despite very low ssfrs , especially for super - solar metallicity stellar populations .",
    "the magenta dash - dot track represents a twice solar metallicity @xmath110-model with @xmath171  gyr .",
    "time steps similar to that of the ssp and csf are shown for this model .",
    "the use of a super solar metallicity model generally results in redder @xmath10 colors at fixed @xmath9 .",
    "after @xmath172 @xmath173-folding times in the sfr ( i.e. , between the last two time steps ) , this @xmath110-model would remain classified as a sfg with a ssfr between @xmath53 and @xmath174  gyr@xmath34 .",
    "we note that for the corresponding solar metallicity sfh ( not shown ) , the model track would cross the boundary between sfg and quiescent after @xmath78  gyr .",
    "thus , some of the galaxies in the `` green valley '' ( @xmath175  ab mag ) are likely to be comprised of galaxies with somewhat older stellar populations with some ongoing sf , rather than sfgs with more vigorous sf and modest amounts of dust ( e.g. , @xmath176  mag )",
    ".    to summarize , based on bc03 stellar population synthesis models , galaxies classified as star - forming in the @xmath118 diagram can be comprised of ( 1 ) galaxies with relatively constant sfrs since the onset of sf , ( 2 ) formerly quiescent galaxies that have undergone a very recent burst , ( 3 ) galaxies with some residual , low level , long - term sf ( e.g. , @xmath162 of mass added over the last @xmath177  gyr with roughly constant sfr ) , and ( 4 ) super - solar metallicity galaxies with low levels of sf .",
    "the addition of dust to any of these scenarios moves sfgs towards redder @xmath9 and @xmath10 colors , and generally keeps them in the region occupied by sfgs .",
    "thus , galaxies with virtually any level of recent sf activity would be classified as sfgs , while those without would be classified as quiescent based on the @xcite boundary .",
    "the models discussed above provide a theoretically motivated backing for the @xcite boundary separating quiescent and sfgs .",
    "here we perform an empirical check on this boundary .",
    "figure  [ bicolor]@xmath178 shows galaxies with mips @xmath179  coverage and indicates the subset with @xmath179  detections ( @xmath180  @xmath58jy ) .",
    "these detections primarily trace the region occupied by sfgs .",
    "note the detections at red colors ( @xmath181  ab mag ) where galaxies would have been considered members of the red - sequence based solely on their @xmath9 color .",
    "most of these mips detections are in the region of the @xmath118 diagram consistent with sfgs with extinction . a stacking analysis of the sfgs in this region ( @xmath181  ab mag ) _ without _ mips detections suggests that they are slightly below the detection limit with a median 24  flux of @xmath182  @xmath58jy , and",
    "therefore have modest obscured sf activity as well ( @xmath78  @xmath4  yr@xmath34  at @xmath183 ) .",
    "in contrast , the median stacked mips 24  flux for quiescent galaxies at @xmath181  ab mag is a factor of @xmath78 lower .",
    "the mips detections therefore lend further support to our ability to isolate sfgs in the @xmath118 diagram , including both blue ( i.e. , unattenuated ) and red ( i.e. , dust reddened ) sfgs .",
    "the models tracks shown in figure  [ bicolor ] provide clues on the recent sfhs of galaxies that occupy different regions of the @xmath118 diagram .",
    "however , it is helpful to know how the sfrs or ssfrs of galaxies in our sample are distributed in the diagram , thus providing a check on our division between quiescent and sfgs .",
    "figure  [ sfr_fig_uvj_2d ] shows the @xmath118 diagram divided into color - color bins of size @xmath184  mag , with each bin color - coded by the median ssfr determined from the sed fit .",
    "the top panel shows a luminosity - selected sample of galaxies at @xmath0  with @xmath185  ab mag , while the bottom panel shows a mass - selected sample with @xmath510.25 .",
    "note that selecting galaxies above a stellar mass limit of @xmath510.25  minimizes the bias against faint red galaxies and therefore results in fewer blue sfgs compared to a luminosity selection .",
    "lines of constant ssfr span from blue @xmath9 and @xmath10 colors to redder ones for sfgs .",
    "thus , sfgs with red @xmath9 and @xmath10 colors indicative of high levels of reddening , perhaps owing to their inclination , can have similar sed based ssfrs to those with bluer colors . at a fixed @xmath10 color , sfgs with",
    "lower sed based ssfrs have redder @xmath9 colors .",
    "the recent sfh of a galaxy therefore also determines where sfgs lie in the @xmath118 diagram , in addition to the level of extinction .",
    "figure  [ sfr_fig_uvj_2d ] shows that the @xcite boundary between quiescent and sfgs is well justified .",
    "note too that although quiescent galaxies with bluer @xmath9 colors ( @xmath186  ab mag ) have somewhat higher ssfrs than redder ones , there are very few galaxies in that region of @xmath118 color - space ( see figure  [ bicolor]@xmath159 ) .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that while there appears to be a strong gradient at a fixed @xmath10 color in sed based ssfrs for sfgs , @xcite find a much smaller range of ssfrs for mips based sfrs .",
    "@xcite however also find a stronger gradient for sed based ssfrs .",
    "these differences between sfr indicators are important to consider when interpreting the results below , especially for the sfrs of sfgs ( see   [ sec_ssfr_sfg ] ) .",
    "figure  [ uvj_hst ] populates the @xmath118 diagram with hst acs color postage stamps for a luminosity - limited sample .",
    "these high resolution images provide a sense for how disk or bulge dominated systems , and their orientations , help to explain what is seen in different regions of the @xmath118 diagram .",
    "the quiescent region is dominated by galaxies with strong bulge components while the star - forming region is comprised of disks .",
    "blue sfgs appear to be face - on disks and the bluest of them ( @xmath187  ab mag ) look like bursting systems ",
    "consistent with the location in @xmath118 color space predicted by the bursting tracks discussed in figure  [ bicolor]@xmath159 .",
    "meanwhile , the reddest sfgs appear to be edge - on disks , consistent with the red colors arising from extinction . interestingly , several",
    "sfgs with intermediate colors ( @xmath188  ab mag and @xmath189  ab mag ) appear to have clear disks but also host a strong bulge component .",
    "the colors of these systems likely arise from older stellar populations , perhaps in a transition phase , rather than dust .",

    "* ) , roughly @xmath11 are classified here as @xmath118-selected sfgs .",

    ", we infer that the fraction of sfgs declines from @xmath259 at the lowest densities to @xmath260 at the highest densities , a factor of @xmath78 decrease . if the sfrs of sfgs were to remain constant across various environments , and the sfrs of quiescent galaxies were negligible , then the change in the relative proportion of quiescent and sfgs with environment would contribute only a factor of @xmath78 towards the decline in the ssfr - density relation .",
    "this amount is less than the order of magnitude decline found in figure  [ ssfr_density_all ] for the sed and [ oii ] based sfrs , but close to the factor of @xmath7 decline found for the mips based sfrs .",
    "the change in the fraction of quiescent and sfgs with density therefore can not be solely responsible for driving the declining sed and [ oii ] ssfr - density relations .",
    "indeed , this is what we find in figure  [ ssfr_density_sfs_all ] , with the sfrs of sfgs declining by factors of @xmath13 .",
    "the mips based sfrs of sfgs also decline , but by a much smaller amount .",
    "thus , both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above contribute towards the declining ssfr - density relation and potentially reflect a diversity of mechanisms that are responsible for quenching sf on different timescales ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other environmental studies at somewhat lower redshifts also find the sfrs of sfgs to decline at higher densities .",
    "for example , using a different color - color selection from our own ( in addition to other selection criteria ) to identify sfgs , @xcite found the ssfrs of sfgs to decline at higher densities at @xmath261 .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite argue that sf activity in sfgs at @xmath262 is independent of local density based on [ oii ] equivalent widths .",
    "however , a straight line fit to the @xmath202(ssfr)-@xmath202(density ) relation in figure  7 of @xcite indicates a negative slope of @xmath195  ssfr)/@xmath195  density@xmath263 at a significance of @xmath264 .",
    "we note that our definition for sfgs differs from that of @xcite .",
    "also , while the luminosity - limited sample of @xcite is limited to regions in the vicinity of clusters , our survey samples a broader range of environments .",
    "the decline in sfrs with increasing density for sfgs seen in figure  [ ssfr_density_sfs_all ] could suggest a gradual shut down in the cold gas supply that fuels sf at @xmath0 .",
    "this is further supported by the decreasing value for a@xmath14  with increasing density . as dust and cold gas",
    "are tied to the sf process , the declining a@xmath14  at higher densities suggests less fuel for sf : recent observations of hi deficient spirals in the virgo cluster with truncated dust disks @xcite provide strong support for this view .",
    "other recent works at low redshift also point to the slow removal of gas in order to reproduce various observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we note that our selection of sfgs in this work utilizes the color - color space in which they are predicted and observed to occupy .",
    "other works that require the detection of emission lines or mid - ir flux find that such galaxies have relatively little variation in sfr at a fixed mass ( intrinsic @xmath265 scatter of @xmath266  dex ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "meanwhile , the range in sfrs ( sed and [ oii ] ) for our @xmath118-selected sfgs across our three lowest density bins ( i.e. , environments typically probed by the field surveys above ) is roughly @xmath267  dex .",
    "thus , our selection of sfgs and interpretation of their properties in this work may differ from those of others .",
    "the ssfr - density slope for sfgs in figure  [ ssfr_density_sfs_all ] for mips based sfrs is much shallower compared to the sed and [ oii ] based sfrs .",
    "several recent results could explain these findings .",
    "for example , while the overall sf activity is clearly diminished in higher density regions , the remaining sf that takes place may occur in a more obscured state .",
    "@xcite find that the few sfgs at high densities at @xmath261 that remain are predominantly spirals of the reddened variety ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite propose that such red , spiral sfgs in higher density environments result from `` outside - in truncation '' , with the remaining sf taking place in the inner regions of the galaxy where higher gas densities and metallicities lead to heavy obscuration .",
    "another explanation could be that increased agn activity in high density regions at these redshifts @xcite could be responsible for the elevated mid - ir flux .",
    "our ldp spectra lack the resolution necessary to identify type 2 agn from emission line diagnostics and therefore such objects likely contaminate our sample .",
    "we note however that less than @xmath89 of our sample has an x - ray counterpart from the champ point source catalog @xcite , and ignoring these objects does not impact our results .",
    "in addition , @xcite used _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectra to show that objects at @xmath268 with mips 24  fluxes less than @xmath70  mjy , as is the case with our entire sample , are dominated by sf rather than agn activity .",
    "finally , the shallow decline of ssfr with density for sfgs in figure  [ ssfr_density_sfs_all ] from the mips based sfrs may reflect the potentially longer timescales probed by that sfr indicator ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "high density regions accrete galaxies from lower densities where the typical sfrs are much higher .",
    "if a sfr indicator traces sf over long timescales , the median sfr for a sample of galaxies at high densities will be higher given that the newly accreted galaxies from low density will still register high sfrs .",
    "lending further support to this explanation is the finding that mips 24  detected sources at high densities at these redshifts exhibit strong balmer absorption @xcite .",
    "this would indicate a substantial population of a - stars of age @xmath70  gyr old , a timescale in accord with the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a wide - field spectroscopic survey of galaxies at @xmath0  that span a range of environments , including the low density field , groups , and the @xmath19 cluster rx  j0152 - 13 .",
    "we selected galaxies with @xmath22  mag for spectroscopy with imacs on magellan with a low - dispersion prism ( ldp ) .",
    "these ldp spectra yielded redshifts with a remarkable precision of @xmath1 .",
    "we used a mass - limited sample above @xmath510.25  to study the sfrs of galaxies as a function of the local galaxy density . above the mass limit",
    ", the distribution of stellar masses in different density bins in our sample is very similar ( figure  [ frac_qc_density ] ) .",
    "thus the environmental trends reported in this paper are not significantly affected by any residual correlation with stellar mass .    given the systematics associated with any single sfr indicator , we used three different sfr indicators in drawing conclusions about the environments at @xmath0  where sf is quenched .",
    "we computed sfrs from : ( 1 ) rest - frame 12 - 15  luminosities measured with _",
    "mips 24  imaging , ( 2 ) sed fitting , and ( 3 ) extinction corrected [ oii]@xmath6    luminosities from the ldp spectra .    to distinguish sfgs from quiescent galaxies we used a @xmath9 vs. @xmath10 diagram ( referred to here as the @xmath118 diagram ) .",
    "this allowed us to determine whether the sfr - density relation at @xmath0  was driven by ( 1 ) a change in the proportion of quiescent and sfgs or ( 2 ) a change in the sfrs of sfgs in different environments .",
    "the @xmath118 diagram is especially useful in isolating dusty , sfgs on the red - sequence , which would otherwise be classified as quiescent based on a single optical color ( figures  [ bicolor ] and [ uvj_hst ] ) .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .   with three different sfr indicators ,",
    "we find that the median ssfr - density relation at @xmath0  declines across the entire range of densities probed : from the low - density field , to the cores of groups and a cluster ( figure  [ ssfr_density_all ] ) .",
    "the declining ssfr - density relation holds even when removing galaxies near the cluster ( figure  [ ssfr_density_out_all ] ) .",
    "the declining ssfr - density relation is therefore general to all environments at these redshifts and not driven by galaxies located near the rich cluster in our sample .",
    "2 .   for fixed mass bins ,",
    "the ssfr - density shows a clear decline with increasing density ( figure  [ ssfr_density_all_massbin ] ) , confirming that the local environment is indeed a factor in impacting the sfrs of galaxies when controlling for mass .",
    "this result also implies that at a fixed mass the sfr - density relation at these redshifts follows a similar decline with increasing density .",
    "the fraction of quiescent galaxies increases by a factor of @xmath197 , from @xmath11 to @xmath269 , between the lowest and highest densities ( figure  [ frac_qc_density ] ) .",
    "we note that these quiescent fractions are similar to the morphological early type fractions seen in @xcite when adjusting for the mass selection .",
    "we also find that the ssfrs of sfgs decline with density ( figure  [ ssfr_density_sfs_all ] ) . the declining sfr - density and ssfr - density relation at @xmath0  can therefore be attributed to a combination of ( 1 ) a changing mix of quiescent and sfgs , and ( 2 ) a decline in the sfrs of sfgs with increasing density .",
    "4 .   in parallel with the declining sfrs of sfgs ,",
    "the median a@xmath14  of sfgs also decline at higher densities ( figure  [ av_density_sed]@xmath178 ) .",
    "this decline in a@xmath14  signifies a lack of cold gas and therefore the quenching of sf in higher density environments .    in future work",
    ", we plan to use hst acs and wfc3 imaging to determine how sf activity is distributed within sfgs in different environments .",
    "such an analysis will lead to insights on whether sf is being turned off across the entire galaxy ( e.g. , via starvation ) or only in the outer regions ( e.g. gas stripping ) .",
    "the answer has implications for the mechanisms that are responsible for regulating sf in galaxies residing in different environments at half the age of the universe .",

    "we also thank stijn wuyts for providing a table for converting mips 24  fluxes into total infrared luminosities .",

    "we primarily use a stellar mass limited sample to conduct our study .",
    "figure  [ masslimit ] illustrates how we determine our mass limit .",
    "the figure shows the stellar masses of galaxies with @xmath22  mag as a function of redshift for galaxies at @xmath0  and with @xmath43 imaging . using the @xmath118 diagram ( see figure  [ bicolor ] ) , we identify quiescent galaxies and denote them as red circles in the figure .",
    "sfgs are shown as open blue diamonds .",
    "note how sfgs extend to low masses where low mass quiescent counterparts are lacking . in order to study a representative stellar mass limited sample of quiescent and sfgs the mass limit",
    "will then be determined by the redder quiescent galaxies .",
    "the solid line shows the stellar mass for an old stellar population formed at @xmath270 and observed to have a magnitude of @xmath271  mag at all redshifts .",
    "note that a similar galaxy with a fainter magnitude would fall below this line . for a quiescent galaxy in our sample at @xmath271  mag ( i.e. , our survey magnitude selection limit ) the",
    "limiting stellar mass at @xmath120 is @xmath510.25  ( dashed line ) .",
