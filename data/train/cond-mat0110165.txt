    "many situations in physics and beyond require the solution of np - hard optimization problems , for which the typical time needed to ascertain the exact solution apparently grows faster than any power of the system size  @xcite .",

    "the exact study of such problems has become feasible  @xcite . yet , with typically exponential complexity of these problems , many questions regarding those systems still are only accessible via approximate , heuristic methods  @xcite .",
    "heuristics trade off the certainty of an exact result against finding optimal or near - optimal solutions with high probability in polynomial time .",
    "many of these heuristics have been inspired by physical optimization processes , for instance , simulated annealing  @xcite or genetic algorithms  @xcite .",
    "extremal optimization ( eo ) was proposed recently  @xcite , and has been used to treat a variety of combinatorial  @xcite and physical optimization problems  @xcite .",

    "we motivate our theoretical model system with a brief study of a disordered spin system on a random graph .",

    ", an optimal value for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 is determined in close analogy with the scaling found numerically in all previous studies  @xcite .",

    "disordered spin systems on random graphs have been investigated as mean - field models of spin glasses  @xcite or optimization problems  @xcite , since variables are long - range connected yet have a small number of neighbors .",
    "particularly simple are @xmath2-valent random graphs  @xcite . in these graphs",
    "each vertex possesses a fixed number @xmath2 of bonds to randomly selected other vertices .",
    "specifically , we have used the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate these graphs which are also referred to as @xmath2-regular graphs .",
    "( note that self loops or double connections are not allowed , and disconnected graphs are highly unlikely ) .",
    "just as on a lattice , one can assign a spin variable @xmath3 to each vertex , and couplings @xmath4 to existing bonds between neighboring vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the energy of the system then is the difference between violated bonds and satisfied bonds , @xmath7 it is more convenient to consider a linearly related quantity , which merely tallies the number of violated bonds per spin in a configuration , @xmath8 where we have used the fact that each graph has a total of @xmath9 bonds .",
    "clearly , for all @xmath10 the spin system has two ferromagnetic ground states with @xmath11 that are easy to find ( all @xmath12 or all @xmath13 ) .",
    "but for anti - ferromagnetic bonds @xmath14 , the ground state energy depends on the disordered structure of the graph itself .",
    "only if all loops in the graph were of even length ( like in a hyper - cubic lattice ) , there are again simple ground states , each with an alternating spin pattern ( nel state ) .",
    "instead , in a random graph , the disorder creates loops that have an equal chance to be odd or even length .",
    "thus , on average , half of the loops can have all bonds satisfied , the other half will have at least one bond frustrated . since the length of loops in random graphs typically diverges with @xmath15 , each odd loop",
    "almost certainly has other odd loops as a neighbors to share a violated bond with .",
    "in fact , even for a spin glass , @xmath4 , the same argument should hold , since only half of the loops will be frustrated and neighboring frustrated loops can share violated bonds . we find that the average ground state energies found for either bond distribution are identical for @xmath16 , in support of the above argument , but the results appear to differ in next - to - leading order corrections .    4.0 in      to obtain the numerical results in fig .",

    "the search is ergodic but yields poor results . for @xmath35 ,",
    "only spins in the worst state get updated which quickly traps the update process to a small region of the configuration space which may be far from a near - optimal solution .",
    "ergodicity is broken in the sense that configurations far from the initial conditions are unlikely to be reached within a given runtime .",
    "the dependence of performance on @xmath0 for this and all previous implementations of @xmath0-eo ( for quite different optimization problems  @xcite ) exhibits the features shown in fig .",
    "[ tauplot ] : the best average performance in approximating ground state energies at a fixed runtime is obtained for a value of @xmath36 slightly larger than @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for @xmath16 .",

    "@xcite suggested a simple argument that yields @xmath43 where @xmath44 was used as the maximum number of updates for a single eo run .",
    "this asymptotic behavior was justified by placing @xmath36 at the `` edge to ergodicity , '' a point between having @xmath0 large enough to descent into local minima while having @xmath0 just small enough to not get trapped inside the basin of any local minimum . in the following",
    "we present a model to make this notion more concrete .    2.0 in",
    "we can abstract the random glass problem in sec .  [ spin ] into a simple model which demonstrates previous observations about @xmath0-eo in an analytically tractable way .",
    "consider the spin system on an @xmath2-valent graph .",
    "each spin @xmath5 can be in one of @xmath20 states @xmath45 : either no adjacent bond is violated and @xmath5 is among the @xmath25 spins , only one bond is violated placing it among the @xmath46 spins , and so forth up to the @xmath21 spins which have all their adjacent bonds violated .",
    "thus , one can define densities for each of the @xmath20 states , @xmath47 .",
    "in general , we can interpret any local search procedure , which only updates a single variable at a time , simply as a set of evolution equations for the @xmath48 , to wit @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the probability that a spin in state @xmath6 gets updated , and the matrix @xmath51 specifies the net transition to state @xmath5 given that a spin in state @xmath6 is updated .",
    "note that conservation of probability requires @xmath52 and conservation of variables requires @xmath53 both , @xmath54 and @xmath55 may generally depend on the @xmath48 as well as on @xmath56 explicitly .",
    "( for instance , for simulated annealing with a temperature schedule , the @xmath57 could depend explicitly on @xmath56 through the changing temperature . )",

    "( [ eeq ] ) now reads @xmath60 with @xmath11 being optimal .",
    "the advantage of this notation lies in the fact that the average update _ preference , _",
    "@xmath55 , is separate from the update _",
    "process _ described by @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , for a random walk ( equivalent to @xmath0-eo at @xmath34 or simulated annealing at high temperature ) @xmath61 , since the probability that a spin in state @xmath5 gets chosen for an update is equal to the number of those spins , no matter how that update is processed by @xmath54 .",
    "what is typically unknown for a hard problem is the general form of @xmath62 .",
    "but to understand the properties of a heuristic expressed through @xmath55 , it may be revealing to `` design '' interesting @xmath54 .",
    "we can construct @xmath54 for the glass problem in sec .",
    "[ spin ] on a trivalent graph in an annealed approximation . since @xmath54 in this case is quite messy , and of no great consequence beyond this section , we focus on one of its components , say , @xmath63 .",
    "this component represents the net flux in or out of @xmath64 , given that a variable in state @xmath65 gets updated .",
    "the annealed approximation consists of the unbiased assumption that each of the @xmath66 neighboring vertices can be in state @xmath5 with probability @xmath67 independently . of course",
    ", no neighboring vertex can be in state @xmath68 , if the bond to it is violated , or in state @xmath2 , if the bond to it is good .    for @xmath63",
    ", the vertex chosen for an update has @xmath65 violated bonds and @xmath69 good bond .",
    "first , when that vertex flips , there is a shift of one variable ( fraction @xmath70 ) from @xmath71 to @xmath64 .",
    "the neighboring vertex on the other end of each of the violated bonds could be in state @xmath37 , @xmath65 , or @xmath72 with probability @xmath64 , @xmath71 , or @xmath73 , respectively , and the vertex attached via the good bond could be in state @xmath68 , @xmath37 , or @xmath65 with probability @xmath74 , @xmath64 , or @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "considering all allowed combinations , we can find the relative ( unnormalized ) influx into any of the @xmath67 as a consequence of updating the vertex at the center .",
    "the sum of the influxes should equal the fraction of moved vertices , @xmath75 , and the relative influxes can be normalized accordingly .",
    "finally , one can identify for each of the combinations where that fraction of moved vertices originated from , which leads to negative out - flux to the @xmath76 [ which is obviously required to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ tnormeq ] ) ] .",
    "the out - flux out of state @xmath5 must be proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we obtain the following three terms contributing to @xmath63 : @xmath77 and the construction of the other elements of @xmath54 in this annealed approximation proceeds equivalently .",

    "more revealing for the analysis of eo is the @xmath35 limit . in that case , on each update only one among the worst spins gets flipped . from some random initial conditions , eo would empty out state @xmath72 first ( @xmath80 ) , than empty out @xmath65 , and so on , until a steady state is reached with the highest non - empty state being @xmath81 with some @xmath82 . in this steady state",

    "hence , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which leads to a drastically simplified equations : @xmath92 all other equations being redundant .",
    "the solution is simply @xmath93 consistent with numerical simulation for all initial conditions .",
    "thus , in the steady state , almost all variables are in the ground state except for a single vertex that is being bounced between state @xmath37 and @xmath65 .",
    "the result that eo converges to the ground state for @xmath94 , while reassuring , is not very helpful to understand either eo or the original problem .",
    "the annealed approximation has eliminated everything that made the problem interesting , and eo s convergence for @xmath94 to a perfectly optimized ground state clearly does not resemble our numerical results from sec .",
    "[ spin ] .",
    "our naive annealed approximation has eliminated most of the relevant features of the original , hard problem .",
    "not surprisingly , it also fails to predict the existence of a finite value for @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ tauplot ] ) ; it is easy to convince oneself that @xmath94 is in fact the best case scenario for @xmath0-eo for all initial conditions and even at finite runtime . yet ,",
    "two basic features of the evolution equations remain appealing : ( 1 ) the behavior of a system with a large number of variables can be abstracted into a relatively simple set of equations , describing their dynamics with a small set of unknowns , and ( 2 ) the separation of update process , @xmath62 , and update preference , @xmath55 , lends itself to an analytical comparison between different heuristics .",
    "this distinction is possible , of course , only as long as these heuristics can utilize the same single - variable , local search process in @xmath54 .",
    "the question is : can we construct interesting processes @xmath54 in the sense that they capture salient features observed for local search on real , np - hard problems",
    "? we will show that even the most basic versions of @xmath54 provide some insights into the workings of various local search heuristics .    for simplicity ,",
    "we choose @xmath2 as small as possible for the three following model situations . without restriction of generality , in these cases",
    "@xmath95 is sufficient , but more complicated phenomena could be accommodated with more states .",
    "first , we consider the most trivial case where a variable when updated merely moves from state @xmath5 to state @xmath96 for @xmath97 , or from state @xmath68 to state @xmath2 ( to make every state accessible ) , @xmath98/n$ ] . this process is conveniently depicted as a flow chart in fig .",
    "[ flowplot]a .",
    "clearly , any gradient descent method will be able to reach the ground state @xmath11 for this process , since there are no barriers .",
    "for instance , simulated annealing with zero temperature will reach this state in @xmath99 trials , and @xmath0-eo for @xmath94 will reach @xmath11 in @xmath100 steps , when averaged over initial conditions .",

    "[ flowplot]b .",
    "remarkably , the previous analysis for @xmath0-eo ( at least , for @xmath34 or @xmath109 ) does not change .",
    "the @xmath11 steady state is reached again in @xmath100 steps for @xmath94 , since eo does not reject uphill moves which are required here to arrive at state @xmath68 through state @xmath65 , and @xmath105 again . on the other hand , it is quite clear that simulated annealing will not arrive at @xmath11 with finite probability in polynomial time , even for a sophisticated temperature schedule .",
    "such energetic barriers are , of course , an inherent feature of many np - hard problems , which makes this simple model quite revealing .",
    "naturally , the range of phenomena found in a local search of np - hard problems is not limited to energetic barriers .",
    "after all , so far we have only considered constant entries for @xmath51 .",
