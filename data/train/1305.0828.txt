    "especially the overlap region between the two interacting disks is surprisingly rich in molecular gas @xcite and is subject to strong large - scale shocks driven by the galaxy collision .",
    "the spatial distribution of the molecular gas as traced by co emission correlates well with the large population of young massive star clusters in the antennae @xcite .",
    "consistently , early mid - infrared iso observations showed that a significant amount of the total star formation of the antennae takes place in the overlap region .",
    "these results were confirmed by spitzer mid - infrared observations @xcite and recent _ herschel_-pacs far - infrared ( fir ) data @xcite . by combining different bands in the fir , @xcite determined local star formation rates ( sfrs ) in small , localized regions of the antennae .",
    "these observations showed that the antennae galaxies harbour a major off - nuclear starburst in the overlap region and an arc - like star forming area in the northern galaxy .",
    "this makes the antennae an exceptional system , together with only a handful of other mergers showing similar levels of off - nuclear interaction - induced star formation , e.g. arp 140 @xcite , ii zw 096 @xcite , ngc 6090 @xcite , ngc 6240 , and ngc 2442 @xcite .",
    "this behaviour contrasts with the general observed trend in a sample of 35 pre - merger galaxy pairs observed by @xcite and with results from previous numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the antennae , the total sfr in the overlap region even exceeds the combined sfr of the two galactic nuclei by a factor of @xmath10 @xcite . while most of the star forming regions across the antennae show a modest level of star formation , a few areas in the overlap region and the western loop are sites of intense localized bursts with specific star formation rates similar to those of heavily star - bursting ulirgs @xcite .    until recently ,",
    "numerical models were not able to reproduce the extraordinary star formation properties of the antennae .",

    "the nature of the overlap starburst has been interpreted in two ways : ( 1 ) the gas - rich overlap region might originate from the two progenitor disks being observed in projection on the plane - of - the - sky @xcite .",
    "the high level of star formation in a spatially extended pattern may result from efficient fragmentation and subsequent star formation @xcite ; ( 2 ) the actively star forming overlap region may be a natural consequence of the special interaction phase of the antennae , shortly before the two galaxies merge , at a time when both disks already overlap , interact and large - scale shocks induce localised star formation @xcite .",

    "the gas is separated into non - star - forming ( blue ) and star - forming gas phases ( orange ) based on the density criterion @xmath43 .",
    "all three simulations show a steady decrease in their gas mass ( upper solid line ) due to consumption by star formation from the very start of the simulations , corresponding to a gradual build - up of the new stellar component ( blue solid line ) .",
    "however , due to the lower pressure support in the effective multi - phase model in the k10-q0.01 simulation ( bottom panel ) , a fraction of @xmath44 of the initial gas mass has already been turned into stars by the time of the first pericentre ( blue dots ) , whereas the k10-q1.0 simulation , with a more efficient stellar feedback ( top panel ) , has only consumed about @xmath45 at the same time .",
    "the k10-q0.1 case is intermediate with @xmath46 .",
    "the total fraction of non - star - forming gas ( blue ) stays constant to within @xmath47 around a level of @xmath48 during the whole course of the simulated time span ( @xmath49 ) , save some little dips during episodes of induced star - formation associated with the first and the second pericentre passages indicated by the blue ( @xmath50 ) and green ( @xmath51 ) dots in figure [ pic : gasevol ] .",
    "the more dramatic evolution can be seen in the star forming gas ( orange , @xmath43 ) which gets efficiently depleted after the first pericentre in the k10-q0.01 simulation with weak feedback ( bottom panel ) , having consumed more than @xmath52 of the initial gas mass in the form of star forming gas at the time of second pericentre . in contrast , in the full - feedback run ( k10-q1.0 ) there is still about @xmath53 of the initial gas mass remaining after the second encounter , which leads to a very rapid consumption of @xmath54 of the gas within the first @xmath55 after the final merger ( red dots ) .",
    "the key difference is that the low feedback simulation consumes the nuclear gas reservoir before the best match in contrast with the full feedback simulation . in table",
    "[ tab : eos ] we find that , with decreasing @xmath13 , the nuclear gas masses go down drastically  from nuclear gas masses of @xmath56 for @xmath29 to a factor of @xmath57 lower in the other two runs .",
    "the gas masses in the overlap regions , on the other hand , show a less pronounced dependence with the chosen effective stellar feedback parameter , staying constant to within @xmath58 , while the sfrs increase significantly for the two lower - feedback simulations as discussed above .    a complementary view of this picture is offered by the star formation histories in the antennae simulations ( figure [ pic : sfhseos ] ) .",
    "the isothermal and quasi - isothermal simulations ( k10-q0 and k10-q0.01 ) , show quite similar initial sfrs of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the sfrs for the simulations with efficient feedback and @xmath61 ( k10-q0.5 and k10-q1.0 ) are smaller by a factor of about @xmath62 from the very start , while run k10-q0.1 is intermediate with @xmath63 . after the first pericentre ( black arrow ) runs k10-q0 and k10-q0.01 both experience a significant rise in their sfrs by more than a factor of five , while the other three simulations show a more gradual increase .",
    "the low - feedback simulations show high total sfrs of @xmath64 ( k10-q0.1 ) and @xmath65 ( k10-q0.01 ) at the time of best match ( see table [ tab : total ] ) , powered by the short - lived overlap starburst shortly after the second pericentre .",
    "the full - feedback ( k10-q1.0 ) and intermediate - feedback ( k10-q0.5 ) simulations , on the other hand , build up very powerful nuclear starbursts after the final merger with a maximum total sfr of sfr@xmath66 and sfrs at the best match of only @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( table [ tab : total ] ) , respectively .",
    "an equally powerful starburst is missing in the case of weaker stellar feedback with sfr@xmath69 for the k10-q0.1 , and sfr@xmath70 for the k10-q0.01 simulations .",
    "having consumed about half of its gas before the second pericentre , simulation k10-q0 has the lowest sfr of all simulations during the time between second pericentre and final merger with a @xmath71 at the best match . leaving aside simulation k10-q0 without stellar feedback ,",
    "we find a clear anti - correlation between the height of the maximum sfrs after the first and second pericentres in the sense that simulations having higher star formation peaks after the first pericentre have correspondingly lower star formation peaks after final coalescence and vice versa .",
    "note also that this trend , interestingly , yields very similar gas fractions in these simulations after final coalescence of the galaxies ( see figure [ pic : gasevol ] ) , differing by less than @xmath72 at 2 gyr .",
    "it is , however , not directly reflected in the sfrs at the time of best match , which we find shortly ( @xmath73 ) after the second encounter but before the time of maximum star formation activity ( see figure [ pic : sfhseos ] ) .",
    "this is firstly due to a more rapid gas consumption during the first pericentre in the weaker feedback runs and secondly due to a weaker pressure support in the star forming gas phase in the k10-q0.1 and k10-q0.01 simulations making the gas in the overlap region more susceptible to local shock - induced fragmentation and subsequent star formation , as discussed above .",
    "overall , the star formation histories are complex and there is a large scatter in the sfrs at the time of best match ( being defined as the time when simulated and observed morphology and line - of - sight kinematics are most similar ) , depending on the parameter choice of @xmath13 for the stellar feedback model .",
    "this , e.g. , leads to very similar sfrs at the time of best match in the full - feedback simulation k10-q1 , employing a vigorous feedback , and the isothermal simulation k10-q0 with no feedback at all .",
    "therefore , global properties like the total sfrs and the total gas masses alone seem to be a degenerate diagnostic when comparing to observations .",

    "the strongest emission peaks from the co(1 - 0 ) transition are also detected in the two galactic nuclei and the overlap region . however , as noted above , there is some discrepancy in the more extended emission , in the sense that the north - western spiral arc in ngc 4038 shows about @xmath92 times higher emission than the simulation , and , there is no emission detected in the south - western region of the southern disk as found at a low level and in one distinct peak in the simulation .",

    "the star formation histories in the different simulations are complex and there is a large scatter in the global observable properties , e.g. the total gas mass , star formation rate and fir fluxes , at the time of best match ( see table [ tab : total ] ; figures [ pic : gasevol ] and [ pic : sfhseos ] ) , even though they only differ in the chosen parameter for the thermal stellar feedback .",
    "we find that additional information provided by a spatially resolved analysis of these properties is needed to break degeneracies in the model assumptions .",
    "synthetic fir maps at @xmath3 m , @xmath4 m , and @xmath5 m ( figures [ pic : rt ] & [ pic : rt2 ] ) show very different fir surface brightness properties for varying efficiencies of the thermal stellar feedback .",
    "we find that , for a rather inefficient stellar feedback formalism with @xmath122 , the simulated maps are in good agreement with the spatially resolved fir observations .",
    "this quantitatively supports results from a simple conversion of the simulated local star formation to molecular hydrogen surface densities that compares well with the observed integrated co intensity map ( figure [ pic : h2 ] ) .",
    "we propose that the reason for this is that the simulations employing low feedback efficiencies encompass a sweet spot between a moderate previous gas consumption history together with a higher susceptibility to induced star formation after the second close encounter caused by the weak thermal support against local gas collapse .",
    "probing synthetic seds in the fir using different gas - to - dust ratios , we find that a low gas - to - dust ratio of 62:1 yields spectral shapes of the simulated seds that are in good agreement with a simple modified black body spectrum fitted to the observed data points ; however , with significantly lower flux densities in the simulated seds ( figure [ pic : sed ] ) . for simulations",
    "k10-q1.0 , k10-q0.1 , and k10-q0.01 with gas - to - dust ratios of @xmath98 , the average flux decrements are @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 within @xmath126 m . the synthetic far - infrared sed of the best - fitting simulation , k10-q0.1 ( i.e. with @xmath31 ) , peaks at a value of @xmath115 at @xmath116 m , similar to the peak value of @xmath117 of the fitted modified black body spectrum at @xmath118 m . a comparison with the observed @xmath127-sfr relation ( *",
    "formulae on page 13 ; their figure 9 ) reveals that the sfrs estimated from our modelled flux densities at @xmath128 m seem to be systematically lower ( by an average of @xmath129  dex ) than the sfrs in the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "about half of the simulations lie within the observed uncertainty in the sfrs , which is given as @xmath130  dex ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 9 ) .",
    "again we find that the agreement is best for simulations with low gas - to - dust ratios of @xmath98 .",
    "is the seemingly favoured low gas - to - dust ratio of 62:1 realistic ?",
    "assuming all the metals to be locked up in the dust grains and none left in the gas phase , this value corresponds to a lower limit in the metallicity being slightly sub - solar ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "this is well within estimates for individual young star clusters in the antennae having metallicities of roughly solar ( @xmath132 , see figure 11 in * ? ? ?",
    "metal abundances determined in the hot ism phase are found to vary widely from sub - solar ( @xmath133 ) to highly super - solar @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "so a lower metallicity limit of @xmath135 is not ruled out by the observations .    on the other hand , we can try and estimate the observed gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "these estimates depend critically on the adopted co - to-2 conversion factor .",
    "if we identify the total gas mass in the disks as @xmath136 ( @xmath137 , since there is no 2 detected in the tidal arms ) , we obtain a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath138 for @xmath139 @xcite , and @xmath140 for @xmath141 as frequently adopted in starbursts @xcite and consistent with the latest analysis @xcite and values obtained in the nucleus of ngc4038 and the overlap regions in the antennae @xcite .",
    "here we have used @xmath142 with @xmath143 taken from @xcite , @xmath144 from @xcite , and all quantities scaled to the same distance . while the uncertainty is large depending on our choice for @xmath145 , these values seem to favour a higher gas - to - dust ratio than the one we have chosen to match the observed fir sed .    what else could influence the simulated sed shape ?",
    "changes in the assumed distance used to match the observations would result only in changes of the normalization in the simulated fluxes , e.g. a distance change of @xmath146 changes the fluxes by @xmath147 .",
    "they would , however , have no influence on the sed _",
    "shapes_. higher dust masses due to higher initial gas fractions or due to cooling and subsequent accretion from a hot galactic halo @xcite , however , might lead to redder simulated seds by increasing the total dust mass at any given time throughout the merger process , without invoking low gas - to - dust ratios .",
    "accordingly higher sfrs might counteract this trend , most likely , however , to a much smaller extent ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we plan to test this hypothesis in future hydrodynamic simulations including the effects of metal evolution and the presence of galactic hot haloes .",
    "the specific form of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) also affects the simulated seds .",
    "the star formation and feedback model we use intrinsically assumes a salpeter imf , e.g. for computing the supernova rates and hence the feedback energy and gas return fractions to the surrounding ism , producing only about half of the luminous stars with respect to a @xcite imf . for consistency",
    ", we also use a salpeter imf to compute the stellar emission in the rt calculations . choosing a chabrier imf to test the impact of the imf in the rt calculations",
    ", we found that a lower mass - to - light ratio ( by @xmath148  dex ) in this case leads to an increase in the fir emission by a similar amount ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "furthermore , the higher relative fraction of massive young stars leads to higher dust temperatures , with the emission peaking at shorter wavelengths and shifting the seds towards the blue . as a result",
    ", an even lower gas - to - dust ratio would be required to match the observed seds in figure [ pic : sed ] . adopting a chabrier imf in the star formation and feedback model",
    "would probably yield a more vigorous stellar feedback due to the higher fraction in massive stars .",
    "the consequences of these changes , however , are less obvious , requiring further self - consistent simulations .",
    "the radiative transfer calculation we use here assumes that the dust grains are in thermal equilibrium with the local radiation field .",
    "however , stochastic heating of very small dust grains by absorption of starlight results in high - temperature transients , during which the absorbed energy is re - radiated mainly at mid - infrared wavelengths . it has been shown that this mechanism may have a significant effect on the emission at 70 @xmath12 m , depending on the local stellar radiation field @xcite . at the fir wavelengths , which are the focus of this article , the emission from large grains at the equilibrium temperature ,",
    "however , is expected to be dominant .",
    "another factor affecting the results from the radiative transfer simulations is the treatment of small - scale structure in the ism . while we assume a smooth density distribution at the scale of individual cells ( @xmath150 pc in the central parts of the galaxies ) , the ism definitely shows structures on much smaller scales .",
    "we do not include any sub - scale modelling of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) around young stars or clumpy molecular clouds . in the simulations discussed in this article",
    "the effect of pdrs is likely to be relatively small , because a large fraction of the total luminosity is from stars older than 10 myr . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - uniform dust density distribution is known to have a potentially significant effect on the dust temperature distribution and infra - red emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a proper treatment of the clumpy cloud structure using a sub - grid model is to be considered in future studies .    in this paper",
    "we have shown as a proof of principle that variations in parameters governing the stellar feedback model result in unambiguous changes in the observable fir properties . without attempting a fine - tuned match , in our adopted star formation and feedback model a rather inefficient thermal stellar feedback formulation ( @xmath151 )",
    "seems to be clearly preferred both by simulated fir maps and seds , similar to the recently advocated range by @xcite .",
    "recently , more realistic numerical models also include metal evolution , kinetic and thermal stellar feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , feedback from active galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , effects from magnetic fields @xcite and accretion from hot galactic gas haloes @xcite .",
    "tests with other codes , e.g. amr grid codes , might also prove useful to gauge numerical artefacts inherent to different methods using the same initial conditions ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a comparison between sph- and grid - based hydrodynamical methods ) .",
    "the next step is to compare further mock observations of the simulation results to multi - wavelength observations of the antennae . in this context ,",
    "constraints from detailed x - ray maps are particularly important @xcite . in doing so , using the antennae system as a `` standard ruler ''",
    ", we can further gauge the employed star formation algorithms and simultaneously possibly gain further insights into the physics of merger induced star formation .",
