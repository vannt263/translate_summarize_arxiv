    "in this section , we analyze the feasibility of our procedure by some rough calculations based on the practical experimental parameters .",
    "first , we give several necessary requirements our architecture parameters must meet .",
    "note that the photon hopping between neighboring resonators will possibly make the relevant photonic qubits run outside of the @xmath126 manifold . to suppress this effect",
    ", the frequency difference @xmath127 of the neighboring resonators must be much larger than the effective photon hopping rate @xmath128 induced by the mediator charge qubit , i.e. @xmath129 the decoherences of the resonators and the charge qubits play significant roles in our procedure .",
    "the charge qubits situated in the resonators are used for state initialization and local measurements of the photonic qubits . because these processes only involve fast single - qubit operations , the decoherences of these inner charge qubits have little effects on our procedure .",
    "each mediator charge qubit participates in the one - way quantum computation process when `` fusing '' its neighboring resonator qubits using a conditional phase gate . to guarantee the high fidelity of the `` fusing '' process",
    ", the coherence time of the charge qubit @xmath130 must be much longer than the required time of the conditional phase gate @xmath131 , i.e. @xmath132 finally , the resonators bear the quantum information for almost the total computation process , thus it is required that the photonic qubits have a coherence time @xmath133 much longer than the required time of the total procedure @xmath134 , i.e. @xmath135    now , we give a brief evaluation of the involving timescales .",
    "the qubit - resonator coupling strength up to @xmath136 has been realized experimentally in ref.@xcite . in this case , the required time of a single - qubit rotation can be estimated as @xmath137 .",
    "considering neighboring resonators @xmath7 with @xmath138 , @xmath8 with @xmath139 , and the mediator charge qubit @xmath29 with @xmath140 , the effective photon hopping rate is approximately @xmath141 , which is much smaller than the frequency difference @xmath142 .",
    "when we implement the conditional phase gate between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , to sufficiently suppress the errors induced by the off - resonant transitions , the coupling strength of the stark - shifted rabi pulse @xmath69 should satisfy @xmath143 . here",
    ", we choose @xmath144 , then the required time of the conditional phase gate is @xmath145 .",
    "the low - q full - wave resonator mode with photon decay rate @xmath146 can be realized in the experiment by choosing big coupling capacitances for the measurement line @xcite .",
    "then the local projective measurement of @xmath28 in the basis @xmath125 can be implemented in a timescale of @xmath147 . to implement one - way quantum computation based on a @xmath2d resonator cubic lattice consisting of @xmath148 photonic qubits , we need the time of @xmath149 single - qubit rotations for the state initialization , the time of @xmath1 conditional phase gates for creating the cluster state , and the time of @xmath150 single - qubit rotations followed by a local measurement for measuring each photonic qubit in a general basis , so the total time of the computation process is approximately @xmath151 on the other hand , the charge qubit with coherence time @xmath152 and the high - q resonator mode with coherence time @xmath153 are reasonable for the practical experimental setup @xcite .",
    "therefore , considering the necessary conditions ( eqs.15 - 17 ) and the practical experimental parameters , it is possible to perform one - way quantum computation based on a low dimensional resonator lattice consisting of tens of resonator qubits .",
    "our procedure is very robust to the device parameter variations , which are unavoidable in solid - state systems .",
    "although we have assume the same resonance frequency for some resonators and same qubit - resonator coupling strength in the preceding parts , these parameter homogeneities are not necessary in our procedure .",
    "therefore , in the sample fabrication process , the requirements for homogeneity and reproducibility can be relaxed and met with current production technology .    in conclusion",
    ", we propose to construct a scalable one - way quantum computer using on - chip resonator qubits",
    ". the unique feature of our architecture is the combination of good scalability and long - lived qubits . with the recent progress in the multi - resonator experiments @xcite ,",
    "our proposal may serve as a guide to construct a small quantum computer consisting of more than a handful of qubits .",

    "<S> we propose a scalable and robust architecture for one - way quantum computation using coupled networks of superconducting transmission line resonators . in our protocol , </S>",
    "<S> quantum information is encoded into the long - lived photon states of the resonators , which have a much longer coherence time than the usual superconducting qubits . </S>",
    "<S> each resonator contains a charge qubit used for the state initialization and local projective measurement of the photonic qubit . </S>",
    "<S> any pair of neighboring photonic qubits are coupled via a mediator charge qubit , and large photonic cluster states can be created by applying stark - shifted rabi pulses to these mediator qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the distinct advantage of our architecture is that it combines both the excellent scalability of the solid - state systems and the long coherence time of the photonic qubits . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this architecture is very robust against the parameter variations . </S>"
