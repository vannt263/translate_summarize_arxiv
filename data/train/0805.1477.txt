    "the problem of plasma  wall interaction is one of the key issues in nuclear fusion research . to control the plasma edge , the concept of an ergodic divertor has been proposed in refs .",
    "the idea of the ergodic divertor is based on the creation of a stochastic zone of magnetic field lines open to the plasma wall which would guide the ionized particles and energy to special divertor plates , and prevent the penetration of wall - released impurities into the plasma core .",
    "the stochastic field lines at the plasma edge should be formed by externally created resonant magnetic perturbations using external coils .",
    "the ergodic divertor ( ed ) ( ergodic limiter ) has been later implemented in several large size and small size tokamaks .",
    "particularly , an ergodic limiter has been installed in text ( refs . ) , in tore supra ( refs . ) and in a number of small - size tokamaks ( in jft-2 m ( @xcite ) , cstn - ii ( @xcite ) , hybtok - ii ( @xcite ) , tbr-1 @xcite , tcabr ( @xcite ) , and other small fusion devices ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ergodic divertor implemented in the textor tokamak , the dynamic ergodic divertor ( ded ) @xcite , has dynamical features in addition to the conventional ones .",
    "it permits the operation with a rotating magnetic perturbation field , which allows not only to broaden the heating footprints to avoid hot spots on the divertor plates but also to actively influence the plasma rotation and mhd activities @xcite . at the same time",
    "the ded perturbation field has an influence on runaway electron dynamics @xcite , spontaneous density built - up @xcite , and reduction of turbulence transport @xcite .",
    "particularly , the ded perturbation field has been used to control edge localized modes ( elm ) in limiter h - mode plasmas @xcite , similarly to the recent experiments in the diii - d tokamak to suppress elm by the external resonant magnetic perturbations @xcite .",
    "the energy and particle transport in the ergodic zone depends significantly on the structure of the perturbation magnetic field at the plasma edge .",
    "numerous recent experiments on the textor - ded have demonstrated that the transport along the field lines in the presence of the resonant magnetic perturbations becomes predominant and prevails over the cross field neoclassical and anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "the field lines even determine a fine structure of heat deposition patterns @xcite , which is mainly due to the reduction of the large scale turbulence level at the plasma edge during ded operation @xcite .",
    "therefore the study of the magnetic field structure is an important first step in understanding the transport properties of the plasma edge modified by the resonant magnetic perturbations .",
    "traditional methods to study the perturbation field structure and its statistical properties in ergodic divertors have been mainly based on numerical codes @xcite .",
    "one of the approaches to study the formation of the ergodic zone of field lines is based on the direct field line tracing in a toroidal system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more in particular , to study the perturbation magnetic field structure in the ed of tore supra the mastoc code has been developed . in its early version @xcite ,",
    "the field lines equations are formulated in a hamiltonian form using the intrinsic coordinates .",
    "the fourier coefficients of the perturbation hamiltonian are found by direct integration along the unperturbed field lines using the biot and savart formula and the field line equations are integrated by the runge",

    "the first step is to formulate the equations of magnetic field lines in hamiltonian form using the magnetic flux coordinates . for this purpose",
