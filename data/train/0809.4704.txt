    "one of the most intriguing features in the wmap@xcite maps of the microwave sky is the cold spot @xcite . under the standard assumption of statistically homogenous gaussian random fluctuations ,",
    "the _ a posteriori _ probability of finding such a feature on the last scattering surface is less than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the cold spot also appears to have a flat frequency spectrum and is located in a region of low foreground emission , making it unlikely to be caused by galactic foregrounds or the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "this has led some theorists to speculate that the cold spot is a secondary effect , generated at some intermediate distance between us and the last scattering surface .",
    "one such model proposes that the cold spot may have been caused by the rees - sciama effect @xcite due to an underdense void of comoving radius @xmath1 and fractional density contrast @xmath2 at redshift of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite reported a detection of an underdense region with similar characteristics in the distribution of extragalactic radio sources in the nrao vla sky survey in the direction of the cold spot , a claim which has recently been challenged @xcite .",
    "an alternative view @xcite proposes that the spot was caused by the interaction of the cmb photons with a cosmic texture , a type of topological defect that can give rise to hot and cold spots in the cmb @xcite .",
    "bayesian analysis by @xcite claims that the texture hypothesis seems to be favored over the void explanation , mainly because such large voids as required by the latter is highly unlikely to form in a @xmath4cdm structure formation scenario .",
    "irrespective of whether the cold spot was caused by a void or a texture , the cmb photons interacting with such an entity would have been gravitationally deflected .",
    "the deflections would lead to a systematic remapping of the primordial cmb anisotropies in and around the cold spot . in this brief report",
    ", we use simple analytic models for the void and the texture to address the issue of detectability of the gravitational lensing signature of either model , using upcoming high resolution cmb experiments .    for calculations presented in this paper , we assume a wmap 5-year @xcite flat @xmath4cdm cosmology with a total matter density parameter @xmath5 and a vacuum energy density @xmath6 .",
    "the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum is set to @xmath7 and the primordial amplitude for curvature perturbations is taken as @xmath8 at a pivot scale of @xmath9 .",
    "the present value of the hubble parameter is taken as @xmath10 .",
    "gravitational redshift of photons passing through cosmic voids can produce decrements in the observed cmb temperature .",
    "this so - called rees - sciama effect @xcite has been proposed as a possible explanation for the existence of the cold spot by @xcite .",
    "they assume a compensated spherical underdense region with fractional density contrast @xmath2 at @xmath11 , and their analysis suggest that the comoving radius of the region required to explain the observed cold spot is @xmath1 .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate by @xcite for a completely empty void ( @xmath12 ) at @xmath3 puts the comoving radius at @xmath13 . to put these dimensions in perspective",
    ", both observations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite suggest that for @xmath14 the typical void size tends to be around @xmath15 .",
    "this means that a @xmath16 void is extremely unlikely to form in the concordance cosmology .",
    "nevertheless , if such a void does exist , its presence should also be apparent through the gravitational deflection of the cmb photons that pass through or near it .",
    "voids , especially the large ones , are seldom spherical and tend to show large axis ratios @xcite .",
    "we use this property to our advantage and model the void responsible for the cold spot as a homogeneous cylinder with its axis aligned along the line of sight .",
    "we take its comoving radius to be @xmath17 mpc and its comoving line of sight depth to be @xmath18 mpc .",
    "the mean redshift of the cylinder is taken to be @xmath19 . under the thin lens approximation @xcite , the simple geometry allows us to approximate the cylinder as a disc of surface underdensity @xmath20 at redshift @xmath21 , where @xmath22 @xmath23 being the physical background density of the universe at that redshift and @xmath24 denotes the fractional density contrast .",
    "this places the cylinder at a comoving distance @xmath25 mpc from us and makes its angular radius @xmath26 . to describe a point on the lens plane",
    ", we set up a polar coordinate system @xmath27 on the lens plane , with the origin at the center of the disc .",
    "here we treat @xmath28 as an angular variable . using the gauss s law for lensing and the circular symmetry of the problem ,",
    "we can write the solution for the effective deflection for a cmb photon as @xmath29 where , @xmath30 with a_v & = & + & = & 32 ( c)^2 _ m l + & = & 0.01785   where in the last step we have substituted the adopted values of the parameters . here , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the comoving distances from the observer to the lens and the source plane ( i.e. , the last scattering surface ) .",
    "@xmath33 represents the comoving distance between the lens and the source .",
    "note that the void acts a diverging lens and the maximum deflection occurs at the edge of the void . for a perfectly empty void @xmath34",
    "the peak deflection has a value of @xmath35 , while for a void with moderate underdensity , @xmath36 the maximum deflection is @xmath37 .",
    "we would like to point out here that the model of the void we have considered is uncompensated because we have not surrounded it with an overdense shell as is often done when modeling voids .",
    "such a compensated void will have a similar deflection profile inside the void but the deflection angles will rapidly fall to zero at the outer edge of the compensating shell @xcite . since the void itself has a size of @xmath38 and most of the detection algorithms we will discuss will depend on mapping the cmb in a roughly @xmath39 square patch around it , the details of the deflection field outside a few degrees of the void will be unimportant for our order of magnitude estimate .",
    "an alternate explanation for the anomalous cold spot entertains the possibility of a collapsing cosmic texture at @xmath40 that interacted with the cmb photons @xcite .",
    "textures are cosmic defects that form when a simple lie group , like su(2 ) , is completely broken @xcite .",
    "the formation and evolution of textures follow a scaling solution in which they collapse and unwind on progressively larger scales .",
    "a texture modifies the space - time metric around itself in such a manner that photons that cross it before collapse are redshifted , while those crossing after collapse are blueshifted .",
    "therefore , depending on whether a texture that collapsed at some conformal time @xmath41 , was outside or inside the sphere defined by the currently detected cmb photons at the same time @xmath41 , we would observe a cold or a hot spot along the direction of the texture @xcite .",
    "incidentally , the texture would also produce gravitational deflection of the cmb photons interacting with it . under the same spherically symmetric scaling approximation",
    "as adopted in @xcite , it can be shown @xcite that to lowest order in the symmetry breaking energy scale , the deflection of a photon trajectory due to a texture can be written as @xmath42 , where ( r ) = 2 .",
    "here @xmath43 is the characteristic angular scale of the texture , and is given by [ rt ] r_t = , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the redshift of the texture and @xmath46 is a fraction of unity .",
    "the amplitude of the deflection is set by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the symmetry - breaking energy scale .",
    "note that in writing the above equation , we have employed a similar co - ordinate system @xmath27 as we did for the void , on the plane transverse to the line of sight and having its origin at the texture center .",
    "the effective deflection angle @xmath49 , by which the cmb photons are remapped on the sky , is then given by , _",
    "t(r ) & = & ( r ) + & = & a_t , [ alphatexture ] with a_t = . unlike the void , the texture acts as a converging lens .",
    "bayesian template fitting for a collapsing texture was performed by @xcite on the 3-year wmap data around the cold spot using the analytic temperature decrement profile given in @xcite .",
    "their fit suggests a value of @xmath50 for the amplitude and @xmath51 for the scale parameter .",
    "the authors argue that their best fit value for @xmath52 is biased high due to noise and by performing the same template fitting on several simulated cmb maps with a cold texture spot in each , they find that the true amplitude is close to @xmath53 , consistent with the upper bound , @xmath54 inferred from the cmb power spectrum @xcite . for the lensing template equation @xmath55[alphatexture]@xmath56 , we therefore adopt the values @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "texture simulations put the value of @xmath46 appearing in equation @xmath55[rt]@xmath56 at @xmath59 , which together with the adopted value of @xmath43 imply the redshift of the texture to be @xmath40 .",
    "this , in turn gives @xmath60 .",
    "note that the scaling profile in equation @xmath55[alphatexture]@xmath56 is valid only for comoving distances @xmath61 and usually a gaussian fall - off is assumed beyond this radius .",
    "we neglect this detail as we will be interested in detecting the signal on a patch of the order of the size of the cold spot . with the values of @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath43 deduced above , the peak deflection near the edge of the cold spot will be @xmath63 , more than an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding value for the void .",
    "this can be understood with the following scaling argument .",
    "if @xmath64 represents the mass or energy density interior to some radius @xmath28 in the void or the texture , then the temperature decrement of the cmb photons will be of order the time rate of change of the potential , @xmath65 , @xmath66 being a characteristic time scale .",
    "for the void , @xmath67 , the hubble time , whereas for the texture , the characteristic time scale is the light crossing time @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , to produce the same temperature decrement , the texture requires less energy density than the void , i.e. @xmath69 . since the gravitational deflection @xmath70 , the deflection due to the texture is expected to be much smaller than that due to the void .",
    "several ongoing and upcoming cmb experiments have been designed to survey smaller sections of the cmb sky with much higher angular resolutions and sensitivities than ever before .",
    "for example , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and the south pole telescope ( spt ) are designed to map roughly a tenth of the cmb sky at arcminute angular resolution and sensitivities of around 10 @xmath71k per arcminute sky pixel . in this section",
    ", we will estimate the significance with which the void or the texture hypothesis can be confirmed by studying their lensing signatures with a high resolution cmb experiment like act .",
    "gravitational lensing caused by massive objects on the line of sight between us and the last scattering surface produces coherent distortions of the small scale features in the cmb , much like the shape distortions of background galaxies due to the lensing by a cluster .",
    "the deflection field couples to the large scale gradients in the cmb and correlates the gradients with the small scale features .",
    "this property can be used to reconstruct the convergence profile of the lens , a subject that has been studied in detail over recent years @xcite . in our case , since the lensing template has been already defined by fitting the temperature decrement of the cold spot , we can approach the problem in a simpler manner : given a deflection template @xmath72 , we ask how likely is it to be detected by a cmb experiment .",
    "we begin by writing the lensed temperature field as , t(r ) & = & t(r + ( r ) ) + & & t(r ) + ( r ) .",
    "we formulate the problem of detecting the template by introducing a coefficient to the template : @xmath73 , and constructing the maximum likelihood estimator for @xmath74 .",
    "the unlensed temperature field can be written as , t(r ) t(r ) -c ( r ) , in terms of which , we can write the likelihood function as , 2 = t^t(r ) c^-1 t(r ) where @xmath75 . this gives the following maximum likelihood estimator for @xmath74 : c = .",
    "by construction , @xmath76 ; therefore , the signal to noise for detection can be written as , [ ston_real ] ()^2 & = & 1 _ c^2 = 12 + & = & .",
