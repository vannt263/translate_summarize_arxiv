    "neutrino oscillations have provided the first experimental manifestation of flavour violation in the lepton sector , fuelling the need to consider extensions of the standard model ( sm ) that succeed in explaining the smallness of neutrino masses and the observed pattern of their mixings  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the many facilities dedicated to study neutral leptons , there is currently a great experimental effort to search for signals of flavour violation in the charged lepton sector ( clfv ) , since such an observation would provide clear evidence for the existence of new physics beyond the sm ( trivially extended to accommodate massive neutrinos ) .",
    "the quest for the origin of the underlying mechanism of flavour violation in the lepton sector has been actively pursued in recent years , becoming even more challenging as the meg experiment is continually improving the sensitivity to @xmath3 decays  @xcite , thus opening the door for a possible measurement ( observation ) in the very near future .",
    "the current bounds on other radiative decays ( i.e. @xmath12 ) , or three - body decays ( @xmath13 ) are already impressive  @xcite , and are expected to be further improved in the future .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm offer new sources of cp and flavour violation , in both quark and lepton sectors . given the strong experimental constraints , especially on cp and flavour violating observables involving the strongly interacting sector , phenomenological analyses in general favour the so - called `` flavour - blind '' mechanisms of susy breaking , where universality of the soft breaking terms is assumed at some high energy scale : in these constrained scenarios , the only sources of flavour violation ( fv ) are the quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings . in order to accommodate current neutrino data , mechanisms of neutrino mass generation , such as the seesaw ( in its different realisations - for a review of the latter , see for instance  @xcite ) , are often implemented in the framework of ( constrained ) susy models : in the case of the so - called `` susy - seesaw '' , radiatively induced flavour violation in the slepton sector  @xcite can provide sizable contributions to clfv observables .",
    "the latter have been extensively studied , both at high- and low - energies , over the past years ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "flavour violation can be also incorporated in a more phenomenological approach , where at low - energies new sources of fv are present in the soft susy breaking terms . however , these are severely constrained by a large number of observables ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned rare lepton decays , leptonic and semi - leptonic meson decays also offer a rich testing ground for clfv . here",
    "we will be particularly interested in leptonic @xmath14 decays , which ( as is also the case of leptonic @xmath15 decays ) constitute very good probes of violation of lepton universality .",
    "the potential of these observables , especially regarding susy extensions of the sm , was firstly noticed in  @xcite , and later investigated in greater detail in  @xcite .    by themselves , these decays are heavily hampered by hadronic uncertainties and , in order to reduce the latter ( and render these decays an efficient probe of new physics ) , one usually considers the ratio @xmath16\\right)}{\\gamma\\left(k^{+}\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\nu \\left[\\gamma\\right]\\right)}\\,,\\label{eq : rk : def}\\ ] ] since in this case the hadronic uncertainties cancel to a very good approximation . as a consequence , the sm prediction can be computed with high precision  @xcite .",
    "the most recent analysis has provided the following value  @xcite : @xmath17 on the experimental side , the na62 collaboration has recently obtained very stringent bounds  @xcite : @xmath18 which should be compared with the sm prediction ( eq .  ( [ eq : cirigliano:2007xi ] ) ) . in order to do so , it is often useful to introduce the following parametrisation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a quantity denoting potential contributions arising from scenarios of new physics ( np ) . comparing the theoretical sm prediction to the current bounds ( i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cirigliano:2007xi ] , [ eq : rk : na62 ] ) ) , one verifies that observation is compatible with the sm ( at 1@xmath21 ) for @xmath22    previous analyses have investigated supersymmetric contributions to @xmath2 in different frameworks , as for instance low - energy susy extensions of the sm ( i.e. the unconstrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) )  @xcite , or non - minimal grand unified models ( where higher dimensional terms contribute to fermion masses )  @xcite .",
    "these studies have also considered the interplay of @xmath2 with other important low - energy flavour observables , magnetic and electric lepton moments and potential implications for leptonic cp violation .",
    "distinct computations , based on an approximate parametrisation of flavour violating effects - the mass insertion approximation ( mia )  @xcite - allowed to establish that susy lfv contributions can induce large contributions to the breaking of lepton universality , as parametrised by @xmath20 .",
    "the dominant fv contributions are in general associated to charged - higgs mediated processes , being enhanced due to non - holomorphic effects - the so - called `` hrs '' mechanism  @xcite - , and require flavour violation in the @xmath23 block of the charged slepton mass matrix .",
    "it is important to notice that these higgs contributions have been known to have an impact on numerous observables , and can become especially relevant for the large @xmath24 regime  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we re - evaluate the potential of a broad class of supersymmetric extensions of the sm to saturate the current measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to previous studies , we conduct a full computation of the one - loop corrections to the @xmath1 vertex , taking into account the important contributions from non - holormophic effective higgs - mediated interactions .",
    "when possible we establish a bridge between our results and approximate analytical expressions in the literature , and we stress the potential enhancements to the total susy contributions .",
    "in our numerical analysis we re - investigate the prospects regarding @xmath2 of a constrained mssm onto which several seesaw realisations are embedded ( type i  @xcite and ii  @xcite , as well as the inverse seesaw  @xcite ) , also briefly addressing @xmath25@xmath26 symmetric models  @xcite .",
    "we then consider more relaxed scenarios , such as non - universal higgs mass ( nuhm ) models at high - scale ( which are known to enhance this class of observables  @xcite due to potentially lighter charged higgs boson masses ) , and discuss the general prospects of unconstrained low - energy susy models . in all cases ,",
    "we revisit the @xmath2 observable in the light of new experimental data : in addition to lhc bounds gev . ] on the sparticle spectrum  @xcite and a number of low - energy flavour - related bounds  @xcite , we implement the very recent lhcb results concerning the br(@xmath27 )  @xcite .",
    "as we discuss here , the increasing tension with low - energy observables , in particular with @xmath6 , precludes sizable susy contributions to @xmath2 even in the context of otherwise favoured candidate models as is the case of semi - constrained and unconstrained susy models .",
    "this document is organised as follows . section  [ sec : rk : formulae ] is devoted to the computation of the 1-loop mssm prediction for @xmath2 .",
    "we compare our ( full ) result to the approximations in the literature by means of the mass insertion approximation ( among other simplifications ) , and discuss the dominant sources of flavour violation , and the implications to other observables .",
    "our results for a number of models are collected in section  [ sec : res ] . further discussion and concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : concs ] . in the appendices ,",
    "we detail the computation of the renormalised charged lepton - neutrino - charged higgs vertex , and summarise the key features of two supersymmetric seesaw realisations ( types i and ii ) used in the numerical analysis .",
    "in the sm , the decay widths of pseudoscalar mesons into light leptons are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes @xmath30 or @xmath4 mesons , with mass @xmath31 and decay constant @xmath32 , and where @xmath33 is the fermi constant , @xmath34 the lepton mass and @xmath35 the corresponding cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element .",
    "these decays are helicity suppressed ( as can be seen from the factor @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sm : pdecays ] ) ) , and the prediction for their amplitude is thus hampered by the hadronic uncertainties in the meson decay constants .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , ratios of these amplitudes are independent of @xmath32 to a very good approximation , and the sm prediction can then be computed very precisely .",
    "concerning the kaon decay ratio @xmath2 , the sm prediction ( inclusive of internal bremsstrahlung radiation ) is  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a small electromagnetic correction accounting for internal bremsstrahlung and structure - dependent effects ( @xmath39  @xcite ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     as can be seen from both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltarcomparisoncuts ] , values @xmath40 could be obtainable , in agreement with refs  @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is substantially altered when one takes into account the current experimental bounds on @xmath4 decays ( @xmath6 and @xmath27 ) and @xmath41 . as is manifest from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltarcomparisoncuts ] , once experimental bounds - other than @xmath6 - are imposed , one could in principle have @xmath42 ; however , taking into account the limits from br(@xmath6 ) , one is now led to @xmath43 .",
    "a few comments are in order regarding the impact of the different low - energy bounds from radiative tau decays and @xmath4-physics observables .",
    "firstly , let us consider the @xmath41 decay : although directly depending on @xmath44 , its amplitude is ( roughly ) suppressed by the fourth power of the average susy scale , @xmath45 . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : deltar : approx : x ] , [ eq : deltar : approx ] ) , @xmath20 only depends on the charged higgs mass - if the latter is assumed to be an ew scale parameter , @xmath20 will be thus independent of @xmath45 in these unconstrained models . as such",
    ", it is possible to evade the @xmath41 bound by increasing the soft susy masses , and this can indeed be seen from the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltarcomparisoncuts ] , where a number of `` blue '' points are found to lie below the br(@xmath41 ) bound .",
    "secondly , the @xmath27 decay can be a severe constraint regarding the susy contributions to @xmath20 in the case of constrained models ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig : cmssm : seesaw ] and [ fig : cmssm : survey ] ) .",
    "we notice that @xmath27 is approximately proportional to @xmath46 ( see for instance @xcite ) while @xmath20 shows no such dependence : thus a regime of small trilinear couplings easily allows evade the @xmath27 bounds .",
    "finally , let us discuss the @xmath6 bounds .",
    "notice that this is a process essentially identical to the charged kaon decays at the origin of the @xmath2 ratio ( the only difference being that the @xmath47 meson is to be replaced by a @xmath48 and the @xmath49/@xmath50 in the decay products by a kinematically allowed @xmath51 ) , and hence its tree - level decay width can be inferred from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sm : pdecays ] ) and ( [ eq : kaon : gamma : smsusy ] ) . due to a negative interference between the sm and the mssm contributions , given by the term proportional to @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kaon : gamma : smsusy ] ) , regimes of low @xmath53 lead to excessively small values of @xmath6 ( below the experimental bound ) , effectively setting a lower bound for for @xmath54 ( see right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : nuhm : deltar ] , in relation to the discussion of nuhm models ) . in turn",
    ", this excludes regimes of @xmath53 associated to sizable values of @xmath20 , as is clear from the comparison of the `` blue '' and `` green '' regions of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltarcomparisoncuts ] .    in summary , we conclude that saturating the experimental bound on @xmath2 clearly proves to be extremely difficult ( if not impossible ) , even in the unconstrained mssm , especially in view of the stringent constraints from @xmath6 .",
    "in this work we have revisited supersymmetric contributions to @xmath55@xmath56 , considering the potential of a broad class of constrained susy models to saturate the current measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "we based our analysis in a full computation of the one - loop corrections to the @xmath1 vertex ; we have also derived ( when possible ) illustrative analytical approximations , which in addition to offering a more transparent understanding of the rle of the different parameters , also allow to establish a bridge between our results and previous ones in the literature .",
    "our analysis further revisited the @xmath2 observable in the light of new experimental data , arising from flavour physics as well as from collider searches .",
    "we numerically evaluated the contributions to @xmath2 arising in the context of different minimal supergravity inspired models which account for observed neutrino data , further considering the possibility of accommodating a near future observation of a @xmath3 decay .",
    "as expected from the ( mostly ) @xmath57 nature of the radiatively induced charged lepton flavour violation , type i and ii seesaw mechanisms implemented in the cmssm provide minimal contributions to @xmath2 , thus implying that such cmssm susy seesaws can not saturate the present value for @xmath20 .",
    "we then considered unified models where the flavour - conserving hypothesis on the @xmath23 slepton sector is relaxed by allowing a non - vanishing @xmath44 ( @xmath58 sector ) . in all models ,",
    "special attention was given to experimental constraints , especially four observables which turn out to play a particularly relevant rle : the recent interval for the lightest neutral higgs boson mass provided by the cms and atlas collaborations , br(@xmath27 ) , br(@xmath6 ) and br(@xmath59 ) .",
    "these last two exhibit a dependence on @xmath53 ( @xmath6 ) and on @xmath44 ( @xmath41 ) similar to that of @xmath20 .",
    "the susy contributions to @xmath20 are thus maximised in a regime in which @xmath53 and @xmath44 are such that the experimental limits for @xmath6 and @xmath41 are simultaneously saturated ; in this regime one must then accommodate the bounds on other observables , such as @xmath60 and br(@xmath27 ) . for a minimal deviation from a pure cmssm scenario allowing for non - vanishing values of @xmath44",
    ", we can have values for @xmath20 at most of the order of @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , the requirement of having a higgs boson mass of 125 - 126 gev is much more constraining on the cmssm parameter space than , for instance @xmath27 ( which is sub - dominant , and can be overcome by variations of the trilinear coupling , @xmath62 ) . in order to have @xmath63",
    ", one must significantly increase @xmath44 so to marginally overlap the regions of @xmath64 gev , while still in agreement with @xmath41 .",
    "models where the charged higgs mass can be significantly lowered , as is the case of nuhm models , allow to increase the susy contributions to @xmath20 , which can be as large as @xmath65 ( larger values being precluded due to @xmath6 decay constraints ) .",
    "more general models , as the unconstrained mssm realised at low - energies , offer more degrees of freedom , and the possibility to better accommodate / evade the different experimental constraints . in the unconstrained mssm ,",
    "one can find values of @xmath20 one order of magnitude larger , @xmath66 . again",
    ", any further augmentation is precluded due to incompatibility with the bounds on @xmath6 .",
    "however @xmath66 still remains one order of magnitude shy of the current experimental sensitivity to @xmath2 , and also substantially lower than some of the values previously found in the literature .",
    "as such , if susy is indeed discovered , and unless there is significant progress in the experimental sensitivity to @xmath2 , it seems unlikely that the contributions to @xmath2 of the susy models studied here will be testable in the near future . on the other hand , any near - future measurement of @xmath20 larger than @xmath67 would unambiguously point towards a scenario different than those here addressed ( msugra - like seesaw , nuhm and the phenomenological mssm ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the analysis presented here focused on the impact of lfv interactions .",
    "should the discrepancy between the sm and experimental observations turn out to be much smaller than @xmath65 , a more detailed approach and evaluation will then be necessary .",

    "<S> it has been pointed out that supersymmetric extensions of the standard model can induce significant changes to the theoretical prediction of the ratio @xmath0 , through lepton flavour violating couplings . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a full computation of all one - loop corrections to the relevant @xmath1 vertex , and discuss the new contributions to @xmath2 arising in the context of different constrained ( minimal supergravity inspired ) models which succeed in accounting for neutrino data , further considering the possibility of accommodating a near future observation of a @xmath3 transition . </S>",
    "<S> we also re - evaluate the prospects for @xmath2 in the framework of unconstrained supersymmetric models . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> we address the question of whether it is possible to saturate the current experimental sensitivity on @xmath2 while in agreement with the recent limits on @xmath4-meson decay observables ( in particular br(@xmath5 ) and br(@xmath6 ) ) , as well as br(@xmath7 ) and available collider constraints . </S>",
    "<S> our findings reveal that in view of the recent bounds , and even when enhanced by effective sources of flavour violation in the right - handed @xmath8 sector , constrained supersymmetric ( seesaw ) models typically provide excessively small contributions to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> larger contributions can be found in more general settings , where the charged higgs mass can be effectively lowered , and even further enhanced in the unconstrained mssm . </S>",
    "<S> however , our analysis clearly shows that even in this last case susy contributions to @xmath2 are still unable to saturate the current experimental bounds on this observable , especially due to a strong tension with the @xmath6 bound .    </S>",
