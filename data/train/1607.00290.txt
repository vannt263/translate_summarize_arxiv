    "despite a big experimental effort done in the past years , the origin of the ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) , i.e. with energies larger than @xmath3 ev , is still unknown .",
    "the pierre auger @xcite and telescope array @xcite observatories , are currently taking data in this energy range .",
    "the southern hemisphere pierre auger observatory , in the province of mendoza , argentina , is the largest cosmic ray observatory in the world .",
    "the telescope array observatory , placed in utah , usa , is the largest in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the uhecr energy spectrum presents two main features , the ankle , found at an energy of @xmath4 ev , which consists in a hardening of the flux , and a suppression at @xmath5 ev @xcite .",
    "note that , even though the spectra observed by the pierre auger and telescope array observatories present some differences , these two features are observed in both measurements .",
    "uhecrs generate atmospheric air showers when they interact with the molecules of the atmosphere .",
    "these air showers can be observed by using ground detectors and/or fluorescence telescopes .",
    "the ground detectors detect the secondary particles , produced during the shower development , that reach the ground . whereas , the fluorescence telescopes detect the fluorescence light emitted by the interaction of the secondary charged particles with the molecules of the atmosphere .",
    "the pierre auger and telescope array observatories have both types of detectors , and a subsample of the events are observed by both detector types .",
    "the arrival direction , the energy , and the composition of the primary uhecr have to be inferred from the air shower observations . in particular , the composition is obtained by comparing observables sensitive to the primary mass with simulations of the atmospheric air showers .",
    "this is subject to large systematic uncertainties because the hadronic interactions at the highest energies are unknown .",
    "there are models that extrapolate the lower energy accelerator data to the highest energies .",
    "some of these models have been recently updated with the large hadron collider data . as a consequence",
    ", the differences among the predictions of the different models decreased but did not disappear .",
    "one of the parameters most sensitive to primary mass is the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum , @xmath6 .",
    "this parameter can be reconstructed with the data taken by fluorescence telescopes .",
    "the composition analyses based on @xmath6 observed by auger , done by using the updated hadronic interaction models , show a decrease of the primary mass from @xmath0 ev up to @xmath1 ev and then , beyond that energy , the mass becomes increasingly heavy @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath6 data obtained by telescope array is consistent with protons @xcite .",
    "however , it has been recently shown that the composition data observed by the two experiments are consistent @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , the statistics of telescope array is smaller than the one corresponding to auger .",
    "the interpretation of the uhecr spectrum depends strongly on the mass composition .",
    "if protons are the dominant component , the ankle is originated by pair production in the interaction of the protons with the low energy photons of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , during propagation through the intergalactic medium .",
    "the suppression observed at the highest energies can originate by the photopion - production of protons interacting with the cmb photons , by the intrinsic cutoff of in the sources , or by a combination of both effects .",
    "the proton model ( known as the dip model ) of the uhecr spectrum have been extensively studied in the literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the uhecr spectrum is composed by heavy nuclei besides protons , the ankle can be interpreted as the transition between the galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . however , this possibility is disfavoured by the auger data @xcite , large scale anisotropy studies show that the extragalactic component should continue below the ankle . recently , a new light extragalactic component , that dominates the flux below the ankle , originated in different sources than the ones responsible of the flux at the highest energies , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this low energy component could also originate in the photodisintegration of nuclei with the photon fields in the vicinity of the acceleration region or the source @xcite . in these scenarios",
    "the suppression is due to the photodisintegration process undergone by the nuclei when they interact with photons of the ebl and cmb , to an intrinsic spectral cutoff in the injected spectrum , or to a combination of both effects .",
    "besides composition information , the observation of secondary gamma rays and neutrinos , generated in the interactions undergone by the cosmic rays during propagation through the universe , can constrain the different models of the uhecr spectrum . in particular , a smaller number of gamma rays and neutrinos are predicted in scenarios with larger fractions of heavy nuclei at the highest energies . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dip model has been rejected at 95% cl by using the upper limit on the neutrino spectrum obtained by the icecube experiment @xcite . in that work the source evolution",
    "is assumed to be the one corresponding to the star formation rate times @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the redshift and @xmath9 is a parameter fixed by fitting telescope array data .",
    "however , it is also shown that models with no emission at @xmath2 can not be rejected with present neutrino data .",
    "extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egb ) observations impose quite restrictive constrains on models of the uhecr spectrum @xcite .",
    "the egb has recently been measured , from 100 mev to 820 gev , by fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "part of the egb originates in gamma - ray point sources .",
    "the gamma rays generated by the propagation of uhecrs can contribute to a diffuse component . by using the 2fhl catalog @xcite of 360 point sources ( mostly blazars ) detected by fermi - lat",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath10 of the integrated egb spectrum from 50 gev to 2 tev originates in point sources @xcite . by using this result , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is found that only a group of nearby sources , contributing in the energy range below the ankle , can be responsible for the light component observed in that energy range .",
    "also , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more restrictive upper limit to the energy density of the electromagnetic cascades , that are developed in the intergalactic medium , is found by using this new result .    in this work",
    "we study the impact of this new estimation on proton models of uhecrs . instead of using the upper limit to the energy density found in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate an upper limit to the integrated gamma - ray flux , in the energy range from 50 gev to 2 tev , that does not originate in point sources .",
    "this upper limit is used to study the constraints that this new result imposes on proton models of the uhecrs spectrum , assuming a more relaxed source evolution than the one used in ref .",
    "we also compare the results obtained by using the gamma - ray information with the ones obtained by using the neutrino upper limit .",
    "the telescope array measurement is considered to fit the uhecr flux assuming a pure proton component .",
    "this is because , as mentioned above , the telescope array data are compatible with a proton composition at the highest energies . following refs .",
    "@xcite the fits are performed for energies above @xmath11 ev .",
    "it is assumed that the sources are uniformly distributed in the universe and that the injected spectrum follows a power law with an exponential cutoff , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a normalization constant , @xmath14 is the spectral index , @xmath15 is the cutoff energy , and @xmath16 parametrize the source density and luminosity evolution of the injection with redshift @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution function @xmath16 is not known , it depends on the types of sources responsible of the acceleration of the cosmic rays , which are still unknown .",
    "the most common options found in the literature correspond to the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) , the gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , and the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work a broken power law of @xmath17",
    "is assumed , @xmath18 where @xmath9 and @xmath19 are free parameters .",
    "the break point at @xmath20 is motivated by the sfr , grb , and some special cases of agn evolution functions @xcite .",
    "note that just the parameter @xmath9 is important for the fit of the spectrum because the contribution of the sources at @xmath2 is negligible for @xmath21 ev .",
    "the evolution corresponding to @xmath2 is important for the generation of gamma rays and neutrinos .",
    "the energy spectrum of uhecr at earth is calculated by using the program transportcr @xcite , which has been developed to solve numerically the transport equations that governs the propagation of the cosmic rays in the intergalactic medium .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is the decrease of the computational time compared with the one corresponding to the methods based on the monte carlo technique .",
    "this makes it very useful for fitting the cosmic ray energy spectrum . besides nuclei",
    ", the transportcr code propagates gamma rays and neutrinos produced in the interactions of them with the photon backgrounds .",
    "the photopion production is based on the sophia code @xcite and there are several models of the ebl available",
    ".    models with fixed cutoff energy are considered .",
    "it is possible to fit also @xmath15 as it is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the computational time increases considerably . note that the processing time is larger in the case considered in this work because of the calculation of the propagation of gamma rays and neutrinos . for a given cutoff energy the proton flux at earth",
    "is calculated for a discrete grid of the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath9 , and @xmath19 . as mentioned before",
    ", the fit of the spectrum depends on the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath9 in the energy range under consideration , then the parameter @xmath19 just modifies the flux of secondary particles without affecting the fit .",
    "that is why only some particular values of @xmath19 are considered .",
    "the spectrum for any value of energy , @xmath14 , and @xmath9 is interpolated by using a trilinear interpolation algorithm , for fixed values of @xmath19 .",
    "the fit of the telescope array spectrum is performed by minimizing the chi - square , which is given by , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the interpolated spectrum , @xmath24 with @xmath25 the energy of the @xmath26-th data point and @xmath27 is a systematic shift in the energy scale ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath28 is the flux measured corresponding to the @xmath26-th bin , and @xmath29 is the uncertainty in the determination of the flux also for the @xmath26-th bin .",

    "@xcite ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath13 and @xmath27 are considered as nuisance parameters and then the profile likelihood technique @xcite is used to get rid of of them . in this technique",
    "the nuisance parameters are replaced by their maximum likelihood estimators .",
    "therefore , only @xmath9 and @xmath14 are the parameters of interest .",
    "the ebl is still quite uncertain , principally because a direct measurement is subject to several foregrounds @xcite .",
    "however , there are different models , available in the literature , for the spectrum as a function of the photon energy and redshift . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the fit of the cosmic ray energy spectrum , assuming a pure proton composition , depends on the ebl model considered . moreover ,",
    "the gamma - ray and neutrino spectra also depend on the ebl model assumed ( see refs .",
