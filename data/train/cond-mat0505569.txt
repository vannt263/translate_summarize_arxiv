    "electron systems confined to small regions  quantum dots ( qd )  and especially their transport properties have been studied extensively for the last decade.@xcite one of the most popular devices is a lateral quantum dot , formed by depleting the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interface of a semiconductor heterostructure . by appropriately tuning negative potentials on the metal surface gates , one can control the qd size , the number of electrons @xmath2 it contains , as well as the tunnel barrier heights between the qd and the large 2deg regions , which act as leads .",

    "an electron in the left lead has to overcome a charging energy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the capacitance of the qd , a phenomenon called the coulomb blockade .",

    "one can change the electrostatics so that energies of the quantum dot with @xmath2 and @xmath12 electrons become equal , and so an electron can freely jump from the left lead onto the qd and then out to the right lead .",

    ", low - temperature coulomb blockade experiments have been repeatedly used to probe the energy level structure of quantum dots.@xcite the dot - lead tunnel coupling discussed here may influence such a measurement  the presence of leads may change what one sees  and so an understanding of coupling effects is needed .",
    "one dramatic consequence is the kondo effect in quantum dots.@xcite here we assume that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the kondo temperature , and , therefore , do not consider kondo physics , focusing instead on less dramatic effects that , however , survive to higher temperature .",
    "we study an ensemble of chaotic ballistic ( or chaotic disordered ) quantum dots with large dimensionless conductance , @xmath16 .",

    "this physical scenario has been considered by kaminski and glazman with the interactions treated in the ci model , i.e. neglecting exchange.@xcite the ensemble - averaged change in the spacing and its rms due to mesoscopic fluctuations were calculated . on average ,",

[",

    "we assume that @xmath67 and , therefore , neglect excited states of the qd concentrating on ground state properties only .",
    "we also assume that the qd is weakly coupled to the leads , treating the tunneling hamiltonian as a perturbation .",
    "corrections to the position of the peak maximum can be expressed in terms of corrections to the ground state energies of the qd via eq .",

    "as the exchange interaction constant @xmath0 becomes larger , more values of the qd spin @xmath73 become accessible .",
    "the structure of the corrections to the ground state energies depends on the total qd spin @xmath73 , and this structure becomes very complicated for large values of the spin @xmath73 .",

    "hence , we can safely assume that in the `` odd '' valley the spin is always equal to @xmath75 .",
    "in the `` even '' valley , one has to allow both @xmath77 and @xmath44 states .",
    "the structure of the expression for the spacing between peaks depends on the allowed spin sequences . for an `` even '' valley",
