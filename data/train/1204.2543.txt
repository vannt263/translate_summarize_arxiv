    "these comparison show that the positional shift between mms 6-main and irs 3 is most likely real .    in order to derive the peak flux , flux density , and source size , a 2d - gaussian fit with two components , was applied to the mms 6-main map .",

    "the residuals after the two - component fit are the 20% level at most as compared to the peak flux . the non - uniform gas distribution , with substructures as described in the later part of this section as well as non - gaussian shaped envelope structures , are the causes of the residuals .",

    "the brightness temperature is estimated to be 52 k from the peak intensity within the beam size .",

    "the total sma flux density of the compact continuum component associated with mms 6-main corresponds to 17 % of the flux density measured within the jcmt / scuba 13@xmath3 beam at ( 6.6 jy ; johnstone & bally 1999 ) .",

    "we argue that these substructures , at the level of 10 times fainter than the mms 6-main peak , are not artifacts due to sampling or image reconstruction .",
    "this is verified by calibrating and imaging our secondary calibrator , 0530 + 135 , in exactly the same manner as for mms 6 . in this image , a dynamic range of at least 50",

    "these results suggest that the density profile is shallow at the inner part of core .",
    "in order to further discuss the internal structure , the observed results are compared with core models in the different evolutionary stages based on the visibility - amplitude ( ) and the spectral energy distribution ( figure 4 ) : ( i ) prestellar core , ( ii ) first adiabatic core , and ( iii ) protostellar core .",

    "the prestellar core model has a lower flux as compared with the other two models .",
    "this is due to the cool gas temperature as expected in a prestellar core .",
    "the observed large flux at is not consistent with the prestellar core model , but clearly suggests that a self - luminous source ( i.e. higher temperature gas than ) is required to explain the observed large flux at .",

    "however , the bump observed at @xmath24200 k@xmath8 corresponds to the linear size of .",
    "we can produce such a bump in the protostellar core by adding a , 300 au disk - like structure as we shown in protostellar model in figure 3 .",
    "the addition of such a disk is too simplistic , in view of the observed structures .",
    "the observed bump in the visibility amplitudes above a smooth extended core , is due to the clumpy structures including the mms 6-main peak which we have detected in figure 1c , and which all have a characteristic size scale of around 300 au .",

    "for example , approximately a factor of six higher flux density was observed at as compared to these two models .",
    "the protostellar model as denoted by the red line agrees well with the observed flux densities .",
    "sed comparisons clearly imply that the observed high flux densities are caused by a self - luminous source .      in terms of the core",

    "the absence of a mid - infrared source , a large - scale molecular outflow , or an ionized jet , with current sensitivity and angular resolution , can be explained if the central driving source is extremely young ( less luminous with high - extinction from surrounding circumstellar material ) , so that the outflow and jet are not yet substantial .",
    "due to the high - extinction , the infrared emission is absorbed by the massive surrounding envelope and then reradiated in the submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "takahashi & ho ( 2012 ) have recently discovered an extremely compact molecular outflow ( 1000 au ) associated with in and .",
    "this is the smallest molecular outflow associated with the intermediate - mass protostars and also even smaller than the outflows found in the protostellar cores in the taurus star forming region ( e.g. , hogerheijde et al .",
    "nevertheless , the estimated outflow force ( @xmath25 m@xmath0 km s@xmath14 yr@xmath14 ) is similar as compared to the other large - scale molecular outflows associated with the protostellar cores in the omc-2/3 region .",

    "note that the number density derived from the sub - clumps is used to represent the number density of the parental gas ( i.e. , the number density before the fragmentation ) .",
    "hence , the estimated jeans length is the lower - limit of the fragmentation scale , if fragmentation occurred much earlier .",

    "( ii ) rotationally supported disk : * shu et al .",

    "mass of the disk - like structure was estimated from the total flux density detected at more than 5@xmath31 level ( 4.7 jy ) , after subtracting the flux contribution from mms 6-main ( 2.0 jy ) with the assumption of ] might be suggested from the observations . in such a case , it is possible that the observed sub - structures could be due to instability within the purported disk .",
    "fragmentation of self - gravitating massive disk - like structure has also been suggested by other studies ( e.g. , gammie 2001 ; kratter & matzner 2006 ; kratter et al .",
    "we emphasize that currently , our observations only indicate substructures , without any definitive evidences of a disk - like structure . with current sensitivity , we also do not have any kinematic information from the envelope / disk - like structures .",
    "sensitive molecular line observations are required to investigate the kinematics and to test the proposed scenario .    in both cases , the physical processes follow the self - gravitational forces .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that fragmentation within the disk will disturb the mass accretion processes onto the central star ( e.g. , kratter et al . 2006 ; 2008 ) .",
    "this process plays an important role in determining the final mass of the primary star .",
    "our observations are the first case to present fragmented sub - structures within core / disk - like structure around an embedded protostar with @xmath32500 au .",

    "origin of the detected sub - clumps could be the eventual cluster members around the primary star or related to brown dwarf / planet formation .",
    "limited data quality at the projected @xmath17 distances of longer than , as well as the presumably optically thick continuum emission at , make it difficult to constrain the detailed spatial structures within scale .",
    "even higher angular resolution observations with the relatively optically thin wavelengths will be necessary for defining the detailed internal density and temperature structures .",

    "observations using the high density tracer or hot core tracer with the sma , alma and evla are important for revealing gas physical conditions and dynamics of the inner envelope , as well as the circumstellar disk ( i.e. , rotationally supported disk ) , if present , at the earliest evolutionary phase ( e.g. , zapata et al .",
    "moreover , high angular resolution and high sensitivity evla observations are also crucial in order to search for the mass ejection phenomena associated with the central star such as faint ionized jet and/or maser .",

    "<S> our recent detection of a very compact and energetic outflow in the co ( 32 ) and hcn ( 43 ) lines , supports the presence of a protostar . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that is one of the first cases of an intermediate mass protostellar core at an extremely young stage . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the peak , we have also spatially resolved a number of spiky structures and sub - clumps , distributed over the central 1000 au . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of these sub - clumps are estimated to be 0.0660.073 m@xmath0 , which are on the order of brown dwarf masses . </S>",
    "<S> higher angular resolution and higher sensitivity observations with alma and evla will reveal the origin and nature of these structures such as whether they are originated from fragmentations , spiral arms , or inhomogeneity within the disk - like structures / envelope </S>"
