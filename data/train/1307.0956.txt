    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "indeed the prewetting line acts as an effective bulk coexistence for a completely - wetting substrate .",
    "in the previous section , it was shown that the nucleation barrier may exist even when the liquid completely wets a flat substrate due to the surface potential which will achieve the prewetting transition . on a spherical substrate",
    ", it is well known that the energy barrier exists even on a completely - wettable substrate since the nucleation is essentially homogeneous nucleation  @xcite . since the free energy of a spherical nucleus , which surrounds the spherical substrate with layer thickness @xmath36 is given by @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the critical radius of homogeneous nucleation known as the kelvin radius which is in fact given by the effective radius @xmath178 in eq .",

    "the energy barrier similar to that of the homogeneous nucleation exists if the radius @xmath179 of the spherical substrate is smaller than the kelvin radius @xmath177 .",

    "then the barrierless nucleation is achieved  @xcite , which is similar to the barrierless nucleation called athermal nucleation  @xcite on a flat substrate when the radius of the substrate is smaller than the critical radius .. the adsorbed wetting film that surrounds the spherical substrate will grow spontaneously without crossing the energy barrier .",
    "again the situation that occurred in completely - wettable flat substrate may be achieved .",
    "since the surface potential which brings about the first - order wetting transition on a flat substrate will turn barrierless zero - contact angle substrate into a finite - contact angle substrate with finite energy barrier of nucleation , it is expected that a similar behavior will be expected on a spherical substrate even when the radius of the substrate exceeds the critical radius of homogeneous nucleation .",
    "in fact , the effect of surface potential or the disjoining potential on the heterogeneous nucleation on a spherical substrate has been considered by russian group  @xcite . since these authors used short - range surface potential and did not pay much attention to the relationship to the surface phase transition , we will extend the work of previous section to explore the possibility of observing the apparent critical nucleus and energy barrier on a completely - wettable spherical substrate when the radius exceeds that of the critical nucleus .    in order to study the effect of surface potential",

    "[ fig:3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the substrate turns from complete - incomplete equilibrium ( wetting transition point ) to incomplete wetting due to the increase of the volume of the spherical interface as the thickness @xmath36 of the wetting layer increases .",
    "therefore , a completely - wettable flat substrate may turn to the incompletely - wettable spherical substrate .",
    "the effect of the curvature of the spherical substrate is more pronounced as the radius of the substrate decreases since the incompletely - wetting thin film is more stable .",
    "a similar result was obtained from numerical work using density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig:3 - 2 ] and [ fig:10 ] that the surface potential created by a spherical substrate is approximated by that created by a flat substrate by renormalizing the parameter @xmath97 which describes the proximity to wetting transition point .",

    "[ fig:11 ] and , therefore , the critical nucleus with finite contact angle may appear on the completely - wettable spherical surface .",

    "also , even if the energy barrier appears , it will not be detectable as long as the energy barrier is lower than the thermal energy @xmath203 .     of the spherical substrate for various surface potentials from incomplete to complete wetting .",
    "above this boundary with strong surface potential @xmath200 , the energy barrier appears in the free energy in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] . ]    the boundary for the appearance of the energy barrier is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] .",
    "if the surface potential is larger than this boundary , the energy barrier similar to that in fig .  [ fig:11 ] will appear .",
    "the potential must be stronger in the completely - wetting regime when @xmath204 ( see eq .  [ eq:21x ] ) than the incompletely - wetting regime ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "also , the potential must be stronger when the radius @xmath179 of the spherical substrate is smaller . in order to observe the nucleation barrier and critical nucleus on a completely - wettable spherical surface",
    ", the surface potential must be much stronger than the typical value of non - polar liquid : @xmath206 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:36x ] ) .",
    "therefore , the appearance of energy barrier and that of the critical nucleus is less probable on a completely - wettable spherical substrate than on a flat substrate .",
    "in this study , we have reviewed our previous work  @xcite where we used the interface displacement model to study the heterogeneous nucleation on a completely - wettable flat substrate where the surface potential induces the first - order incomplete to complete wetting surface phase transition .",
    "it is pointed out that the classical picture breaks down on a completely - wettable substrate , where cnt predicts that the critical nucleus does not exist and the nucleation barrier is expected to vanish since the apparent contact angle vanishes .",
    "in fact , both the critical nucleus of the heterogeneous bulk phase transition in the oversaturated vapor and the critical nucleus of the surface thin - thick prewetting transition in the undersaturation vapor can exist and transform continuously at the bulk coexistence on a completely - wettable substrate .",
    "therefore , the critical nucleus as well as the free - energy barrier of nucleation exist on a completely - wettable flat substrate .",
    "furthermore , the nucleus exists even under the undersaturated vapor .",
    "the undersaturated vapor turns to an effectively oversaturated vapor due to the effective interface potential of the substrate which prefers infinitely thick wetting films .",
    "the laplace pressure ( or the effective chemical potential @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:29x ] ) ) that is necessary to produce semi - circular liquid - vapor interface of the droplet becomes positive by the interface potential even under the undersaturated vapor .",
    "then , the bulk coexistence does not play any role in the critical droplet in the complete - wetting regime .",
    "instead , the prewetting line plays the role of the coexistence in the complete - wetting regime .",
    "various properties of the critical nucleus change continuously as functions of the chemical potential .",
    "therefore , the nucleation rate ( eq .  ( [ eq:1x ] ) )",
    "is expected to change continuously at the bulk coexistence .",
    "our results support the conclusion reached from a numerical simulations in ising system by sear  @xcite .",
    "he simply stated that this small nucleus does not `` know '' whether it will grow to form a wetting layer of finite thickness or a bulk phase of infinite thickness .    these findings on a flat substrate change drastically on a spherical substrate .",
    "the free energy decreases more rapidly as the thickness of the wetting film increases on a spherical substrate compared to that on a flat substrate because the volume of the film increases more rapidly on a spherical substrate than on a flat substrate .",
    "then , the energy barrier which is necessary to form a critical nucleus of the droplet may disappear .",
    "therefore , the possibility of observing the activation process of heterogeneous nucleation on a completely - wettable real substrate will depend strongly on the morphology of the substrate .",
