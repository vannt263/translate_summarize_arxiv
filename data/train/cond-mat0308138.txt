    "the idea of exploiting both the charge and the spin of an electron in semiconductor ( sc ) devices has lead to the growing field of spintronics .",
    "@xcite several spintronic devices are already proposed , @xcite but the full potential of spintronics has still to be discovered . at the moment the essential ingredients for spintronics , e.g. , the injection and detection of a spin polarized current , the spin transport in sc etc .",
    ", are only partially achieved in experiments . in this paper",
    "we want to investigate one of these main challenges : how to create a spin polarized current in a sc ?",
    "there are several methods that obtain a high spin polarization , but most are useful for basic studies rather than applications : illumination of the sc with circularly polarized light , @xcite injection of electrons from a ferromagnetic scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip @xcite or from a paramagnetic semiconductor polarized in an external magnetic field.@xcite better applicable for devices is the injection from a diluted magnetic semiconductor,@xcite but these have the drawback of low curie temperatures @xmath0 up to now .",
    "more promising is the injection from a common ferromagnetic metal , like fe , into a sc due to the high @xmath0 . in this case",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in the diffusive limit the spin polarization of the injected current is vanishingly small , @xcite if the contact between the fm and the sc is ohmic .",
    "this ` fundamental obstacle ' is traced back to the conductivity mismatch between both materials .",
    "it can be overcome by either a ferromagnet with nearly 100% spin polarization at the fermi energy , e.g. , a half metal , or by inserting a spin polarized interface resistance at the fm / sc interface , @xcite e.g. , an extrinsic tunneling barrier or an intrinsic schottky barrier . by means of a schottky barrier @xcite or of an al@xmath1o@xmath2 barrier @xcite spin injection",
    "could be achieved in experiments .    here",
    "we investigate the spin injection from a ferromagnet ( fm ) into a sc in the ballistic regime , _",
    "i.e. _ , the limit where inelastic and incoherent scattering events are negligible . in this case",
    "there is no scattering in the perfect bulk regions and the whole resistance results only from the interface region so that there is no conductivity mismatch .",
    "therefore other effects emerge that are not present in the diffusive limit : kirczenow @xcite has shown that some fm / sc interfaces can act as ideal spin filter .",
    "this is the case , if for a direct - gap sc the fermi surface of the fm projected onto the two - dimensional brillouin zone ( 2dbz ) has a hole at the @xmath3 point for one spin direction .",
    "but the material combinations fe / znse and fe / gaas investigated here , do not fulfill this condition .",
    "it has been pointed out that the symmetry of the fm wave functions is very important for the spin injection process .",
    "@xcite if there is a second fm lead to detect the spin polarization of the current , additional effects like the forming of quantum well states , fabry - perot like resonances and extremely high magnetoresistance ratios have been reported in a recent theoretical _ ab - initio _ study .",
    "@xcite    there are two types of calculations for the ballistic spin injection already published : by means of analytical models using plane waves @xcite and by _ ab - initio _ methods . @xcite",
    "while the model calculations obtain only a few percent of spin polarization , the inclusion of the full band structure of the fm and the interface region in _ ab - initio _ methods can result in spin polarizations up to 99% .",
    "the origin of this high polarization are the different symmetries of the fe @xmath4 states at the fermi energy for the majority and the minority spin .    here",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "the investigated heterostructures consist of a half - space of ideal bulk fe and one of the ideal bulk sc ( either znse or gaas ) .",
    "their properties are described by the surface green s function determined by the decimation technique .",
    "@xcite between the half - spaces there are several monolayers ( mls ) of the interface region , where the atomic potentials are allowed to deviate from their bulk values .",
    "this interface region consists of four mls of fe and two mls of sc for the ( 001 ) orientation and appropriate numbers of mls for the ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) orientations .",
    "the corresponding potentials are obtained self - consistently from a fe / sc / fe junction geometry by the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green function method.@xcite it is assumed that the sc lattice is matched to the bulk fe , resulting in an fcc sc lattice constant double the lattice constant of bcc fe @xmath5 . the experimental lattice constant of fe is used .",
    "this means that the sc is stretched compared to the bulk lattice constant by 1.3% and 1.6% for znse and gaas , respectively , resulting in a slightly smaller energy gap . in order to describe the sc accurately ,",
    "two empty spheres per unit cell are introduced to account for the open space in the geometry of the zinc - blende structure .",
    "a perfect two - dimensional translation symmetry in the whole system is assumed and so the in - plane component @xmath6 of the @xmath7 vector is conserved while crossing the interface .",
    "the @xmath8 axis is always assumed to be the growth direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , standing perpendicular on the interface . also the conductance @xmath9 is calculated by a two - dimensional fourier transformation in dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "the calculations of the ground state properties are performed within the density - functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange and correlation terms .",
    "it is well known that it underestimates the energy gap in sc by around one half .",
    "otherwise it gives very accurate fm and sc bands and is well suited for the considered problem .",
    "the potentials are described within the atomic - sphere approximation , and the wave functions are expanded in angular momentum up to a cutoff of @xmath10 for self - consistency and @xmath11 for the conductance calculations .",
    "spin - orbit coupling and spin - flip scattering are not included in the calculations .",
    "this could have an effect in case of injection into the sc valence band , where the spin - orbit interaction is stronger , but not in the case of the valence band which has mainly @xmath12 character and negligible spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the conductance @xmath9 is calculated by the landauer formula .",
    "@xcite @xmath9 is expressed as a sum of the transmission probabilities through the scattering region ( here the fe / sc interface ) over all available conducting channels .",
    "these channels are enumerated by the spin orientation @xmath13 or @xmath14 , the bands @xmath15 at the fermi energy of the left and right lead , respectively , and the @xmath6 vector .",
    "the spin - dependent conductance , normalized to the area of the two - dimensional unit cell , reads @xmath16 with @xmath17 the area of the two - dimensional brillouin zone . since the @xmath6 vector and the spin @xmath18 of the electron are conserved in our calculation , they are the same for the incoming and the outgoing states . here",
    "the landauer formula is evaluated by a green s function formalism introduced by baranger and stone .",
    "@xcite details are presented elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the spin polarization @xmath19 of the current is defined by the spin dependent conductances in both spin bands @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the conductance of the majority and the minority electrons , respectively .",
    "to investigate the effects of the symmetry of the fe bands , we calculate first the hot injection of electrons , _",
    "i.e. _ , of fe electrons well above the fermi level @xmath23 , which falls in the gap of the sc . for most of the calculations",
    "we restrict the discussion to the @xmath3 ( @xmath24 ) point for simplicity , _ i.e. _ , we consider only electrons with perpendicular incidence on the interface .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that in most spin injection experiments the fermi energy in the sc is only some tens of mev above the conduction band minimum resulting in a very small fermi sphere around the @xmath25 point .",
    "first we investigate the spin injection in fe / sc junctions grown in the ( 001 ) orientation .",
    "the ( 001 ) direction has the highest symmetry and is therefore the best candidate for a _ symmetry enforced high spin polarization of the injected current,@xcite _",

    "@xcite this relatively high bias in experiments with an optical detection of the spin polarization is needed to gain a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio of the emitted light .",
    "it is believed that the bias can be reduced in experiments with thinner tunneling barriers or with an electrical detection of the polarization , since then a much smaller current is needed .",

    "it has been shown @xcite that in tunneling the smallest damping factor @xmath68 is located at the @xmath3 point in the energy gap for znse and gaas ( and for other direct - gap semiconductors ) , so that this point plays the major role for thick tunneling barriers .",

    "this gives a relatively low and a more or less constant spin polarization with thicker tunneling barriers . in the se",
    "terminated interface the resonant interface state lies lower in energy , where the effective tunneling barrier is thicker than for the zn terminated interface .",
    "thus the resonant interface state has a much smaller influence on the minority conductance . with larger barrier thickness",
    "the high spin polarization is more or less restored because only states at @xmath3 , having the smallest decay parameter are important and the symmetry arguments apply again .",
    "we have reported first - principles calculations on spin injection from fe into gaas and znse through the ( 001 ) , ( 111 ) , and ( 110 ) interfaces .",
    "the electronic transport has been assumed to be in the ballistic regime , and the interfaces have been assumed to have two - dimensional periodicity , so that @xmath6 is conserved during scattering at the interface .",
    "then , in a landauer - bttiker approach , the conductance is determined by the transmission probability summed for all @xmath6 . under these assumptions ,",
    "we have considered hot and thermal injection  the latter also in the presence of a schottky barrier  and approached the higher bias regime .",
    "we have reached the following conclusions .",
    "\\(i ) the spin polarization of the current is highest when most incoming fe bloch states of one spin direction are totally reflected due to symmetry mismatch with the sc conduction band states  we call this effect `` symmetry - enforced spin polarization '' .",
    "this is the case for the ( 001 ) interface , where minority - spin electrons for @xmath24 practically can not be transmitted .",
    "the lower symmetry of the ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) interface does not lead to such a selection rule .",
    "even for the ( 001 ) interface , in the case of hot injection , above an energy threshold where the fe minority @xmath27 band starts , the minority - spin current increases rapidly even at @xmath24 , being then symmetry - allowed .",
    "\\(ii ) for the symmetry - enforced spin polarization to be realised , the injection must take place close to the conduction band edge , so that only states near @xmath24 are relevant ; these have a well - defined and suitable symmetry properties .",
    "also , the interface should be as ordered as possible , otherwise @xmath6 is not conserved and incoming minority - spin fe states from all @xmath6 can scatter into the sc conduction band . then the spin polarization will decrease .",
    "\\(iii ) the case of thermal injection ( _ i.e. _ exactly at @xmath23 ) , has been considered for the ( 001 ) interface with and without a schottky barrier .",
    "the symmetry concepts still hold , since the least - decaying complex band of the tunneling barrier has the same symmetry properties as the conduction band ( both are of @xmath27 character ) .",
    "we have seen that resonant interface states existing in the vicinity @xmath23 for minority spin can be important for the current spin polarization . even in the case of a schottky barrier",
    "they can provide a resonant tunneling channel for the minority - spin electrons decreasing the spin injection effect .",
    "\\(iv ) in the case of a higher bias , a wider energy range must be considered , so that states with @xmath69 as well as resonant states close enough to @xmath23 become relevant .",
    "then the spin polarization decreases , but spin injection is still achieved .    it can be argued that a well ordered interface , necessary for our symmetry selection rule , is difficult to realize experimentally .",
    "however , recent successful attempts in increasing the spin injection efficiency have been reported , accompanied by an improvement of the quality of the interface.@xcite therefore , we are optimistic that our work will motivate further research in this direction .",
