    "it is known since long that the brightness variations of long - period variable stars ( lpvs ) go along with spectral changes such as the doubling of the absorption lines around maximum light @xcite .",
    "this line - doubling phenomenon appears to be shared by all lpvs @xcite , and occurs when the shock wave associated with the envelope pulsation propagates through the line - forming region @xcite .",
    "since it is almost impossible to study individual line profiles in the very crowded optical spectra of lpvs , it is necessary to resort to a technique that correlates the observed spectrum with a spectral template @xcite .",
    "the shape of the resulting cross - correlation function ( ccf ) thus represents the average shape of those lines in the observed spectrum that match the template . by carefully designing spectral templates collecting all spectral lines forming at given depths in the atmosphere",
    ", it is even possible to probe the velocity field in pulsating variables .",
    "this is the general principle guiding the tomographic method described in this review .",
    "when applied to a temporal sequence of spectra , the method is even able to reveal in a spectacular way the * outward propagation of the shock wave * , as shown in sect .",
    "[ sect : rtcyg ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : rtcyg][fig : rycep ] !",
    "the study of the velocity field in the atmosphere of lpvs poses a special challenge , as the spectrum of these stars is extremely crowded , particularly in the optical domain .",
    "the cross - correlation technique provides a powerful tool to overcome this difficulty .",
    "the information relating to the line doubling ( velocity shift and line shape ) is in fact distributed among a large number of spectral lines , and can be summed up into an average profile , or more precisely into a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) . if the correlation of the stellar spectrum with a mask involves many lines , it is possible to extract the relevant information from very crowded and/or low signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "the ccf writes @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the observed spectrum , @xmath2 is the template ( a binary template has been adopted , being 0 around spectral lines of interest , and 1 elsewhere ) , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the boundaries of the spectral range covered by the observed spectrum",
    ". the radial velocity @xmath5 is then obtained from the wavelength shift @xmath6(min ccf ) where the ccf is minimum : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "we refer the reader to reference @xcite for a detailed description of the ccf mathematical properties .",
    "the tomographic method rests on our ability to construct reliable synthetic spectra of late - type giant stars @xcite , and from those , to identify the depth of formation of any given spectral line .",
    "rigorously , the contribution function ( cf ) to the flux depression @xcite should be used to evaluate the geometrical depth at which a line forms .",
    "however , it would be a formidable task to compute the cf for each line appearing in the optical spectrum of lpv stars .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , the ` depth function ' @xmath9 is used instead , which provides the geometrical depth corresponding to monochromatic optical depth @xmath10  at the considered wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "this function expresses the depth from which the emergent flux arises , in the eddington - barbier approximation , and should not differ much from the average depth of formation for sufficiently strong lines @xcite .",
    "different masks @xmath12 are then constructed from the collection of @xmath13 lines @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is some constant optimized to keep enough lines in any given mask without losing too much resolution in terms of geometrical depth . a natural limit to the resolution that can be achieved on the geometrical depth",
    "is provided by the width of the cf @xcite , and according to the nyquist - shannon theorem of elementary signal theory , there is no advantage in taking @xmath16 smaller than half the cf width of typical lines probed by the mask .",
    "each mask @xmath12 should then probe lines forming at ( geometrical ) depths in the range @xmath17 in the atmosphere .",
    "these masks are used as templates to correlate with the observed spectra of the lpv stars .",
    "this procedure should provide the velocity field as a function of depth in the atmosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zoph2 ] ) , whereas for static atmospheres , all ccfs should yield the same radial velocity ( fig .  [",
    "fig : constant ] ) .    a more detailed description of the method can be found in @xcite , while specific tomographic masks are available at _ http://www - astro.ulb.ac.be / html / home.html#tomography_. the set of tomographic masks used in this paper was constructed from a synthetic spectrum at @xmath18 = 3500  k and @xmath19 ( see reference @xcite for details ) .",
    "the properties of the masks ( in terms of numbers of lines and depths probed ) are listed in table  [ tab : masks ] . the depth @xmath20 is in fact expressed in terms of a reference optical depth @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the optical depth at the reference wavelength of 1.2 @xmath23 m .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath24 and the geometrical depth .",

    "note how the ccfs broaden and become more contrasted in the upper atmospheric layers ( c8 is the outermost mask ) , reflecting the fact that the strongest spectral lines form in the outermost layers .",
    "the radial velocity ( in km / s ) derived from each ccf is given in each panel .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]        [ fig : schwarz ]    an _ a posteriori _ validation of the method is provided by the fact that ( i ) the ccfs obtained with the tomographic masks for the non - pulsating m giant @xmath23  gem ( lb variable with a variability range of only 0.11  mag in the hipparcos catalogue ) are all single - lined and yield almost identical radial velocities , as expected ( fig .  [",
    "fig : constant ] ) , and ( ii ) the asymmetric ccfs obtained for the warm mira variable z oph reflect the shape of the individual lines probed by any given mask ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zoph ] ) .",
    "the asymmetric , and sometime even double - peaked , ccfs observed for mira variables thus correctly represent the underlying spectral lines , and are not artifacts of the correlation process .",
    "moreover , around maximum light , the shape of ccfs in the successive tomographic masks follows a definite sequence : the ccf in the deepest layer exhibits a single blue component whereas a single red component is observed in the outermost ccf , and double - peaked ccfs are observed in between ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zoph2 ] ) .",
    "this sequence , which is observed in almost all mira around maximum light , is consistent with the  scenario describing the effects of the passage of a shock wave through the atmosphere of a pulsating star ( sect .",
    "[ sect : schw ] ) .",
    "the passage of a shock wave through a stellar atmosphere is expected to give rise to a very specific temporal evolution of the spectral line shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schwarz ] ) , as first noted by schwarzschild @xcite in relation with w vir cepheids . when the shock wave penetrates the line - forming region , the velocity discontinuity associated with the shock gives rise to the doubling of the spectral line : the red component of the line is formed in the matter falling in above the shock , whereas the blue component arises from the ascending matter lying behind the shock .",
    "the intensity of the blue and red components of a double line observed around maximum light in a lpv star should follow the temporal sequence illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schwarzschild ] .",
    "this is indeed the case , as revealed by the evolution of the ccfs of the mira variables rt  cyg and ry  cep around maximum light ( sect .",
    "[ sect : rtcyg ] ) .",
    "but the tomographic method described in sect .",
    "[ sect : tomo ] allows us to go one step further , by showing that the schwarzschild scenario also reveals itself in terms of a definite _ spatial _ sequence of profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zoph2 ] ) . by combining those spatial sequences",
    "obtained at successive phases in the light cycle , the tomographic method reveals that _ line - doubling appears later in upper layers of the mira atmosphere , thus translating the upward motion of the shock wave _",
    "[ sect : rtcyg ] ) .",
    "a long - term monitoring of the mira stars rtcyg ( @xmath42  d ; @xmath43 ) and ry  cep ( @xmath44  d ; @xmath45 ) has been performed with the fibre - fed echelle spectrograph elodie @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph elodie is mounted on the 1.93-m telescope of the observatoire de haute provence ( france ) , and covers the full range from 3906    to 6811    in one exposure at a resolving power of 42000 .    for rt  cyg , a monitoring in august - september 1999 covered phases @xmath46 to 0.16 around maximum light , with 32 spectra obtained during this phase range ( corresponding to an average resolution of @xmath47 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : rtcyg ] ) . for ry  cep ,",
    "the monitoring covered a _ full _ light cycle extending from august 2001 ( phase -0.17 ) to february 2002 ( phase 0.92 ) , and 40 spectra were obtained ( fig .  [",

    "the sequences of ccfs presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : rtcyg ] and [ fig : rycep ] clearly obey the  temporal evolution , with a single red component transforming progressively into a single blue component around maximum light .",
    "there are moreover clear phase lags between the different layers , this transformation occurring at later phases in outer layers .",
    "thus , the  scenario holds for mira variables , and this conclusion definitely points towards the velocity stratification associated with the shock wave as the cause of the double absorption lines observed in mira variables , as opposed to complex radiative processes ( e.g. , radiative release of thermal energy into the post - shock layer or temperature inversion ) @xcite .",

    "we defer the detailed comparison between the radial - velocity curves of ry  cep and rt  cyg , and their interpretation , to a forthcoming paper .",
    "we just stress here noteworthy features on the radial - velocity curve of ry cep : ( i ) the red peaks ( corresponding to matter falling in ) are observed at the same velocity in all three masks ; they disappear at increasingly later phases as one considers layers closer and closer to the surface , since the outermost layers are the last ones to be penetrated by the shock wave which suppresses the infalling component ( i.e. , red peak ) ; ( ii ) the maximum outward velocity is the same for the three masks ( @xmath48 km / s ) , and is reached around phase @xmath49 .",
    "after that , matter will decelerate in the innermost layers first , as they lose the impetus provided by the shock wave which is moving away .",
    "the tomographic technique presented in this paper opens new perspectives for the study of the dynamics of lpv stars , as it allows to visualize the outward motion of the shock wave in the atmosphere . at this stage , however , the results remain qualitative as it is difficult to quantify the geometrical depth of the layers probed by the different masks .",
    "it is hoped that , in the future , this method may be combined with interferometric imaging in the different masks to derive the corresponding radii .",
    "this would give direct access to the velocity of the shock , for instance .",
    "we thank the observing program committee of the observatoire de haute - provence for a generous allocation of telescope time .",
    "the afoev is warmly thanked for positively answering our request to monitor ry cep during the time of the spectroscopic monitoring .",
