    "since 1993 , the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) 5.5-m telescope ( see @xcite ) has been used for extensive observations at 32  ghz of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on angular scales of @xmath7 .",
    "the receiver input is switched at 500  hz between two beams of @xmath8 ( fwhm ) separated by @xmath9 .",
    "the ovro 40-m telescope , under - illuminated at 14.5  ghz to match the 5.5-m beam , provides a second frequency channel for spectral discrimination of foregrounds ( see table 1 ) .",
    "both receivers detect right - circular polarization .",
    "table 1    parameters for the ovro 5.5-m and 40-m telescopes    3.0in[h]p0.9 in p0.9 in p0.9 in & 5.5-m & 40-m frequency & 32  ghz & 14.5  ghz + bandwidth & 5.6  ghz & 3  ghz + system & 30 k & 48 k + temperature & & + beam efficiency & 0.61 & 0.70 + beamwidth & @xmath10 & @xmath10 + ( fwhm ) & & + beamthrow & @xmath11 & @xmath12 + main beam & @xmath13sr & @xmath14sr + solid angle & & +    [ tab : params ]    in the `` ring5 m '' experiment , we observe 36 fields at @xmath15 spaced by the @xmath9 beamthrow in a ring around the ncp ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "to minimize variations in differential contributions from the ground , each field is observed only within @xmath16  minutes of upper culmination . in each flux measurement ,",
    "the telescope moves in azimuth to alternate the beams on the main field ; each measurement is thus the difference between the signal from the main field and the average of the signals in the two adjacent fields ( @xcite  1989 ) . as a result ,",
    "a strong signal in one field produces a negative signal half as strong in each of the two flanking fields ( see figure 2 ) .    to estimate the contribution of point sources ,",
    "the ring5 m fields were mapped on the vla at 8  ghz to a sensitivity of 0.25  mjy ; a total of 34 sources were detected with @xmath17mjy .",
    "subsequent monthly vla monitoring of these sources at 8 and 15  ghz provided accurate measurements of flux densities and spectral indices , enabling us to estimate the flux densities at both 14.5  ghz and 32  ghz and to subtract the point - source contribution from these data sets .",
    "we report here only on results relevant to an anomalous foreground we have detected .",
    "the implications for cmb observations and a full discussion and analysis of our results will be presented in subsequent papers .",
    "our cumulative observations of the ring5 m fields have achieved a @xmath18 rms sensitivity of @xmath19k per field at 32  ghz , and @xmath20k per field at 14.5  ghz .",
    "signals @xmath21k are seen at both frequencies , and excellent reproducibility of these data between the 1994 , 1995 and 1996 observing seasons indicates that they represent real structure on the sky .",
    "in addition to good agreement between independent data sets at the same frequency , a spearman rank test ( @xcite ) , modified to account for correlations introduced by the switching ( see  3 ) , finds a correlation @xmath22 between the two frequencies , with a significance @xmath23 .",
    "the strength of the observed correlation between independent observations on separate telescopes is further evidence that the signals are astronomical in origin , and not artifacts of the observing procedure .",
    "since the only common element between the two channels is our observing strategy , we explored the possibility of systematic contamination by observing the ring5 m fields at 14.5  ghz for two weeks at _ lower _ culmination .",
    "the data obtained showed the same signals , to within the observed @xmath24k scatter between two - week subsets of our upper culmination data .    in all of the following discussion , we use data sets",
    "from which the point - source contributions have been subtracted .",
    "apart from one source , which affected 3 of our 36 fields , the contributions of point sources were much smaller than the detected signals .",
    "the maximum @xmath18 error on the estimated point - source contribution to a field was @xmath25k .",
    "there is therefore no doubt that we have detected a significant astronomical signal which is not due to point sources .",
    "the strongest signals seen in both the 14.5 and 32  ghz channels have steep spectral indices and amplitudes @xmath26k at 14.5  ghz .",
    "a likelihood analysis yields @xmath27 for the spectral index of the data set as a whole , indicating the presence of significant emission with @xmath28 .",
    "recent westerbork observations ( @xcite ) reveal polarized structures at high galactic latitude as bright as 8  k at 325  mhz .",
    "these features , on scales of @xmath29 , are seen in linear polarization only ; the corresponding total intensity maps are extremely smooth , and upper limits @xmath30k are set on any conterparts in total intensity .",
    "this is interesting , as @xmath31  k features with spectral index @xmath32 can just reproduce the observed structures at 14.5  ghz if we were 100% sensitive to linear polarization",
    ". tests of our 14.5  ghz polarizers , however , indicate @xmath33 contamination from linear polarization across our bandpass , so it is clear that such polarized features can not account for the signals we have detected .",
    "moreover , given the smoothness of the total intensity maps , it is highly improbable that the structure in the polarized emission is due to variations in intrinsic polarization angle , and the polarized structure is interpreted as faraday rotation of an intrinsically smooth , polarized synchrotron background by an intervening screen . as a result , the polarization angle will have the @xmath34 dependence of faraday rotation and the structure should be negligible at 14.5  ghz .",
    "total intensity maps from the wenss survey ( @xcite ) , covering 20 of the 36 ring5 m fields , show no detectable signals after removal of discrete sources .",
    "comparison of the maximum signal at 14.5  ghz with the rms from the wenss maps in the overlap fields places a lower limit @xmath35 on the spectral index of the foreground we have detected .",
    "thus , based on the wenss maps , we know that the contribution of any steep - spectrum ( @xmath36 ) component is negligible and we now investigate what foreground spectral index is favored by our data .",
    "we model our data as a gaussian cmb component in the presence of a single foreground of variable strength but constant spectral index @xmath37 .",
    "defining @xmath38 , as described in  1 , for each field @xmath39 , we measure @xmath40 given @xmath41 measured at two frequencies @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we can solve for the cmb component in terms of the unknown spectral index of the foreground : @xmath44 the likelihood function for the cmb component ( see , for example , @xcite  1989 ) is then given by @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the error in the residual cmb component , and @xmath47 is the intrinsic cmb variance .",
    "the likelihood constructed from the point - source subtracted data sets at 14.5 and 32  ghz peaks at @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ruled out at the @xmath18 level .",
    "our data is thus consistent with a foreground of spectral index @xmath50 , and we conclude that the foreground is either unusually flat - spectrum synchrotron radiation , or free - free emission .",
    "in an attempt to correlate this component with known galactic foregrounds , we convolved the iras @xmath2 m map ( @xcite ) of the ncp with our beam and beam - switch .",
    "the source - subtracted 14.5  ghz data , along with results of the iras convolution , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we find a clear correlation between the iras @xmath2 m maps and our 14.5  ghz data set . to assess the significance of this result without _ a priori _ knowledge of the distribution of the iras @xmath2 m brightness or 14.5  ghz temperature on @xmath52 scales , we use spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath53 .",
    "since this depends only on the data _ ranks _ , whose distribution is known , and not on the values themselves , we can determine the significance of an observed value of @xmath53 unambiguously .",
    "the observed correlation between the 14.5  ghz and iras @xmath54 m data is @xmath55 , and , for 36 _ independent _ fields , the probability of observing @xmath56 by chance is @xmath57 . due to our switching strategy ,",
    "however , only every third field is actually independent , and numerical simulations show that this reduces the significance to @xmath58 .",
    "we note that region spanning 3h-8h , where the correlation is weakest , is also the region where we see the strongest signals at 32  ghz ; the spectral indices of these fields are consistent with @xmath59 , indicating the presence of a significant cmb signal .",
    "taking @xmath5 as the spectral index of the foreground most consistent with both our data and the wenss maps , we can use the 14.5  ghz and 32  ghz data to solve for the free - free component in the manner of equation ( [ eq : sep ] ) .",
    "a linear fit to the foreground component yields the conversion @xmath60",
    "@xcite  ( 1995 ) have recently estimated the free - free contamination of small - scale anisotropy experiments through h@xmath3 observations of the ncp . for the brightness temperature of optically thin hydrogen",
    ", we expect @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the free - free gaunt factor ( @xcite ) , the frequency is @xmath63 , the electron temperature @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the emission measure . for @xmath66k , the h@xmath3 surface brightness in rayleighs ( @xmath67 )",
    "is given by @xmath68 ( @xcite ) .",
    "simulating our observing procedure on the maps of @xcite  ( 1995 ) , we measure @xmath69  r on @xmath52 scales in h@xmath3 . if we assume @xmath70  k for the temperature of the emitting gas , the inferred upper limit on the rms at 14.5  ghz due to free - free emission is @xmath71k , a factor of @xmath72 lower than the observed @xmath73k .",
    "furthermore , the h@xmath3 maps are featureless ; in the 36 ring fields , no signals are seen with @xmath74r . for the @xmath75k signals we detect ,",
    "equations ( [ eq : tb])-([eq : ialpha1 ] ) predict an h@xmath3 brightness @xmath76r .",
    "if considerable dust lies along the line of sight to the ncp , extinction might account for the low levels of observed h@xmath3 emission ; estimates from the iras @xmath2 m intensities , however , imply @xmath77 magnitudes of visual extinction ( @xcite  1996 ) , so that the upper limits on free - free emission can be increased by 74% at most .    as @xmath78",
    "is increased beyond @xmath79k , the allowed orbital space for recombination shrinks , and equation ( [ eq : ialpha1 ] ) is no longer valid ; for @xmath80k , a fit to the h@xmath3 recombination coefficient gives @xmath81 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath82k free - free emission can therefore be reconciled with the observed @xmath83 h@xmath3 limit if the emission is due to gas at @xmath84k . for these temperatures ,",
    "free - free brightness temperatures of @xmath82k at 14.5  ghz require an @xmath85 .",
    "the corresponding allowed @xmath86 parameter space is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the observed structure in the iras @xmath54 m map of the ncp region is part of a large hi feature known as the ncp loop .",
    "this feature , which encompasses all of the 36 ring5 m fields , has been modeled by meyerdierks et al .",
    "( 1991 ) as the wall of an expanding cylindrical shock .",
    "while the production of a _ dense _ ionized component such as that implied by figure 3 may pose significant difficulties  such structures will be extremely overpressured , and must necessarily be transient phenomena  it is intriguing that the combination of large emission measure and high temperature arrived at by interpreting the observed structure at 14.5  ghz as free - free emission are suggestive of just such a shocked component of the ism .",
    "if the emission is due to @xmath87  k gas , this component should have a counterpart in soft x - rays ; the absence of any rosat pspc pointings near the ncp and the low resolution of available all - sky surveys , however , prevent any useful comparison with existing data sets .    perhaps more plausible , though no less anomalous , is the possibility that the observed structure at 14.5  ghz is due to flat - spectrum synchrotron emission .",
    "synchrotron spectral indices as flat as @xmath88 are typically observed only in plerions associated with the very youngest snr ( @xcite ) , and we would not expect such emission from the ncp loop  an old remnant , with expansion velocity @xmath89  km / s . a notable exception to the general steepness of galactic synchrotron radiation , however , is the filamentary structure observed toward the galactic center .",
    "these features , consisting of long , nearly one - dimensional threads , have spectral indices @xmath90 yet show considerable linear polarization , suggesting that the dominant emission mechanism is synchrotron ( @xcite ) .",
    "although such structures would suffer from a similar lifetime problem as free - free filaments and require recent injection of high - energy electrons to maintain a flat spectrum , they would obviate the high temperature and pressure required in the case of free - free emission .",
    "we have detected a significant correlation between emission with temperature spectral index @xmath50 observed at 14.5  ghz in the ring5 m experiment , and the iras @xmath2 m maps .",
    "if this is free - free emission , the lack of accompanying h@xmath3 emission implies that it is from a component of the ism with @xmath4k .",
    "the large em required to produce the observed signals at these temperatures is typical of snr , an interpretation supported by the morphology of the ncp loop , with which the iras emission is associated .",
    "@xcite  ( 1996 ) have recently reported a large angular scale correlation of the residual free - free component in the cobe dmr sky maps with far - infrared dirbe emission .",
    "the level of this signal at 53  ghz , however , is consistent with predictions from h@xmath3 observations , implying that on @xmath91 scales , the observed free - free emission is from a @xmath92k phase of the ism . moreover , if the correlation with free - free emission persists to small scales , the power spectrum of the high - latitude dirbe @xmath93 m maps @xmath94 where @xmath95 , implies a level of free - free at @xmath96 scales marginally consistent with the limit inferred from h@xmath3 observations .",
    "if the observed foreground is not unique to the ncp region , our results imply that such emission could be a serious contaminant to small - scale cmb measurements in other areas of sky .",
    "this component does , however , have a significantly steeper spectral index and may be subtracted out by multi - frequency observations .",
    "moreover , further observations now in progress to determine the extent of the correlation between 14.5  ghz and @xmath54 m emission indicate that these results for the ncp region are atypical .",
    "we would like to thank a. g. de bruyn for making data from the wenss survey available to us prior to publication , gaustad et al . for placing their h@xmath3 images in the public domain , c. heiles for pointing us to the work of meyerdierks et al , and a referee for a number of useful comments .",
