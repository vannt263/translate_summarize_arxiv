    "@xmath5 is ambient isotopic in @xmath0 to the boundary of a fiber    given a three - manifold , one might ask how many distinct gof - knots it contains . for instance",
    ", it is well known that the only gof - knots in @xmath6 are the right- and left - handed trefoil knots and the figure eight knot .",
    "morimoto partially answers this question for lens spaces and , in the process , shows that @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 do not contain any gof - knots @xcite . in the same paper",
    ", morimoto asks whether there is an upper limit to the number of gof - knots that may be contained in a single lens space .",
    "in early 2006 , ken baker answered this question in the affirmative , considerably extending morimoto s results @xcite .",
    "baker shows that the lens spaces @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , contain exactly two gof - knots , except for @xmath12 which contains three .",
    "he proves that all other lens spaces contain at most one gof - knot .",
    "more generally , baker gives a criterion for determining exactly how many gof - knots a given lens space contains .    using this criterion , it is possible to find a plethora of lens spaces with no gof - knots .",
    "for instance , one can verify that the examples first discovered by morimoto , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , do not contain any gof - knots . in light of the fact that there are lens spaces with no gof - knots",
    ", baker asks whether every lens space must contain a knot whose exterior is a optb ?",
    "for instance , although @xmath9 contains no gof - knots , it is the result of @xmath13-surgery on the left - handed trefoil @xmath14 , and therefore contains a knot whose exterior is a optb , namely the core of the surgered torus .",
    "we aim to address this question .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ thm : maintheorem ] suppose that @xmath0 is a three - manifold which does not contain a gof - knot .",
    "suppose further that @xmath15 is prime .",
    "then @xmath0 contains a knot whose exterior is a optb if and only if @xmath0 can be obtained as @xmath2-surgery on the trefoil , or on the figure eight , where @xmath16 .    note that if @xmath0 is a lens space ( or , more generally , a heegaard floer homology @xmath17-space ) , then it is well known that @xmath0 can not be obtained by surgery on the figure eight .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "baker s approach relies on the fact that a three - manifold @xmath0 which contains a gof - knot @xmath5 is the branched double cover of @xmath6 , branched over a closed 3-braid . in this formulation",
    ", @xmath5 is the lift of the braid axis of this 3-braid . in the case of lens spaces",
    ", it is known that @xmath18 is the double - cover of @xmath6 branched over a link @xmath17 if and only if @xmath17 is equivalent to the 2-bridge link @xmath19 . along these lines",
    ", baker proves the following theorem :    [ thm : bakertheorem ] the lens space @xmath18 contains exactly @xmath20 gof - knots if and only if the 2-bridge link @xmath21 admits exactly @xmath20 equivalence classes of 3-braid representatives .",

    "4 .   @xmath17 admits no 3-braid representatives otherwise .      in section [ sec : proof ] , we recount our previous result on the classification of genus one , one boundary component open books in @xcite and use this to prove theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] . in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] , we combine moser s results on lens space surgeries @xcite with theorems [ thm : maintheorem ] and [ thm : bakertheorem ] to produce an infinite family of lens spaces which do not contain any knot whose exterior is a optb .",
    "the mapping class group of the once - punctured torus @xmath32 is generated by right - handed dehn twists about dual non - separating curves , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in an abuse of notation",
    "we denote , by @xmath35 , the right - handed dehn twist around the curve @xmath36 the left - handed dehn twist around @xmath35 is then denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "thus , given an open - book decomposition ( @xmath32 , @xmath38 ) , we can express @xmath38 as a product of dehn twists , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 ( in our notation , composition is on the left ) .",
    "using relations in the mapping class group of @xmath32 , we can separate the genus one , one boundary component open books into six categories according to the following @xcite :    [ thm : obclassification ] let @xmath41 be a curve in @xmath32 parallel to the boundary .",
    "then any genus one , one boundary component open book can be written as @xmath42 , where @xmath38 is one of the following types :    a. : :    @xmath43 , where the    @xmath44 , some @xmath45 . b. : :    @xmath46 ,    where the @xmath44 , some @xmath45 . c. : :    @xmath47 , for @xmath48 .",

    "the curve @xmath53 is the binding.,height=302 ]    hence , if @xmath54 has an open book decomposition and @xmath55 denotes the result of @xmath2-surgery on @xmath53 , then for @xmath16    @xmath56    suppose now that @xmath0 is a three - manifold which does not contain a gof - knot , but which does contain a knot @xmath5 whose exterior is a optb",
    ". then @xmath0 must be some @xmath2-dehn - filling of a optb with boundary - fixing monodromy ( if necessary , we can introduce twists around a curve parallel to the boundary of the fiber surface ) .",
    "therefore , we can express @xmath0 as @xmath2-surgery on the binding of some genus one , one boundary component open book , where @xmath16 ( if @xmath57 , then @xmath0 has a genus one , one boundary component open book decomposition , and therefore contains a fibered knot ) .",

    ", it is shown that @xmath60 is positive and strictly increasing in the @xmath61 .",
    "one can show , more or less identically , that the same is true for the open books in theorem [ thm : obclassification].a .",
    "the computation of @xmath60 for the open books in theorem [ thm : obclassification].c - f is very simple as the surgery diagram is uncomplicated .",

    "baker gives a classification of lens spaces with no gof - knots , and moser characterizes precisely those surgeries on the torus knot @xmath80 which yield lens spaces .",
    "moser proves the following theorem @xcite :      hence , for the left - handed trefoil , which is the torus knot @xmath14 , this condition becomes @xmath84 , and the lens space obtained is @xmath85 .",
