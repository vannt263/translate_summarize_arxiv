    "at least 1% of single white dwarfs with cooling ages less than 0.5 gyr are known to display both infrared excess emission and photospheric elements heavier than helium ( farihi et al .",
    "since primordial heavy atoms gravitationally settle below the atmospheres in these stars , the observed heavies likely have been accreted from their circumstellar disks ( koester 2009 ) .",
    "evidence is strong that these disks are derived from the tidal - disruption of an asteroid or minor planet ( jura 2008 ) .",
    "if so , then the abundances in the atmospheres of white dwarfs can serve as an indirect but uniquely powerful tool to measure the bulk composition of extrasolar planetary matter ( zuckerman et al . 2007 ) .",
    "for example , from the limited data now available , it appears that extrasolar asteroids resemble the inner solar system with values of @xmath3(c)/@xmath3(si ) or @xmath3(c)/@xmath3(fe ) at least a factor of 10 below solar ( jura 2006 , farihi et al .",

    "the most plausible explanation for the origin of these disks is that an asteroid had its orbit sufficiently perturbed ( debes & sigurdsson 2002 ) that it entered the tidal zone of the white dwarf and was shredded ( jura 2003 ) . even with this scenario for disk formation , we have very limited constraints on the disk masses , lifetimes , and compositions such as the relative amounts of gas , rock and ice . here",
    ", we present new x - ray and infrared data which enable an improved measure of the evolution of the disks orbiting two accreting white dwarfs and thus enhance their use as probes of extrasolar planetary systems .    g29 - 38 and gd 362 were the first and second single white dwarfs , respectively , found to have an infrared excess ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 , becklin et al .",

    "however , these data , by themselves , do not allow us to decide whether the dust originates near the star from a tidally - disrupted asteroid ( jura 2003 ) or , instead , arises in a cold outer reservoir and then drifts inwards to replenish the observed warm disk , as occurs around some main - sequence stars ( chen et al .",

    "zuckerman et al . ( 2007 ) found that gd 362 s atmosphere has an appreciable mixture of hydrogen and helium . because accurate models for the outer layers of white dwarfs with such a mixed composition were not available , they could only report the abundance ratio of hydrogen to helium but not the total amount of hydrogen . subsequently , koester ( 2009 )",

    "zuckerman et al . ( 2007 ) measured @xmath3(he)/@xmath3(h ) = 14 in gd 362 s photosphere , and there are two possible scenarios to explain this measurement .",
    "first , the star may have been a hydrogen - dominated white dwarf until it cooled to an effective temperature less than 11000 k. at this temperature , the mass of the convective envelope increased , and it is possible that some interior helium was dredged up to the surface ( tremblay & bergeron 2008 ) .",
    "however , even if this scenario correctly describes gd 362 s history , the star still may be unusual .",
    "bergeron et al . ( 1990 ) analyzed 37 da white dwarfs and with the assumption that all the stars have @xmath50 @xmath51 = 8.0 , they found that most have @xmath3(he)/@xmath3(h ) @xmath31 1 , but deduced that g1 - 7 and g67 - 23 have @xmath3(he)/@xmath3(h ) @xmath45 20 , near the ratio determined for gd 362 .",
    "however , these two abundance ratios are questionable .",
    "helium absorption lines in g1 - 7 and g67 - 23 are not directly measured ; instead helium abundances are inferred from the hydrogen line profiles .",
    "broadening caused by an increased helium abundance and broadening stemming from an increased surface gravity are degenerate ( zuckerman et al . 2003 ) , and the assumed value of @xmath50 @xmath51 for these two stars are probably too low . for g1 - 7 , liebert et al .",
    "( 2005 ) derived @xmath50 @xmath51 = 8.83 , while for g67 - 23 , zuckerman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and holberg et al . ( 2008a ) derived @xmath50 @xmath51 = 8.5 and 8.8 , respectively .",
    "the trigonometric parallax for g67 - 23 supports the high gravity model ( holberg et al .",
    "therefore , the photospheric value of @xmath3(he)/@xmath3(h ) in gd 362 may be uniquely high for a da white dwarf .",
    "a second possibility is that gd 362 has been evolving continuously as a star with a helium - dominated atmosphere . in figure 1",
    ", we display the hydrogen masses in the convective zones of helium - dominated white dwarfs from voss et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and dufour et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for stars in the temperature range 8000 k @xmath47 t @xmath47 20,000 k. dufour et al .",
    "( 2007 ) report values of @xmath3(h)/@xmath3(he ) , and we use these ratios along with the total mass in the convective zone for helium - doiminated white dwarfs from koester ( 2009 ) , a value which typically is near 2 @xmath17 10@xmath52 g , to determine the mass of hydrogen in the white dwarf s atmosphere . for reference , we also plot the amount of hydrogen in ceres and callisto by assuming water contents of 25% by mass and 50% by mass , respectively ( michalak 2000 , mccord & sotin 2005 , thomas et al .",
    "2005 , canup & ward 2002 ) , and , as standard in these models , by assuming that the hydrogen is largely contained within h@xmath53o .",
    "we see from figure 1 that the total mass of hydrogen in gd 362 s convective envelope appears anomalously large .",
    "gd 16 is another helium - dominated star with a distinctively large amount of hydrogen and an infrared excess",
    ". both voss et al . ( 2007 ) and dufour et al . ( 2007 ) attribute much of the hydrogen in the atmospheres of white dwarfs with helium - dominated atmospheres to accretion from the interstellar medium . because gd 362 has both an infrared excess and a substantial atmospheric pollution of heavy atoms , we consider models where its hydrogen is derived from a tidally - disrupted parent body . during the star s red giant evolution before reaching the agb and becoming a white dwarf , it sublimated surface water - ice from any orbiting parent body within at least 40 au ( jura 2004 ) .",
    "we imagine that the parent body or bodies that have been accreted by gd 362 had internal water to account for the atmospheric hydrogen as , for example , in models of callisto ( canup & ward 2002 ) .      we model gd 362 s atmospheric abundances of hydrogen and heavy elements , as well as the upper limit to the current accretion rate derived in @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that a parent body of mass , @xmath55 , has its orbit perturbed so that it is tidally disrupted by the white dwarf ( debes & sigurdsson 2002 , jura 2003 ) , and this defines the starting time , @xmath56 = 0 , of the accretion event .",
    "the debris is rapidly reduced by mutual collisions to small dust particles , some at least as small as 1 @xmath0 m in radius to account for the strong silicate emission ( jura et al .",
    "2007b ) , and the material forms a disk .",
    "material in this disk then accretes onto the star with a characteristic time scale @xmath57 that is determined by viscous dissipation .",
    "we write for the mass of the disk , @xmath58 , that : @xmath59 the accretion rate onto the star , @xmath60 , equals @xmath61 or : @xmath62    because hydrogen rises to the top , the total mass of hydrogen in gd 362 is the amount in the mixing layer , @xmath63 , and : @xmath64 in @xmath65 , we use observational constraints to derive the composition of the parent body as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "thus : @xmath66    the total mass of heavy element @xmath67 in the mixing layer of the star , @xmath68 , is governed by both the gain from accretion and the loss from settling which are described by dupuis et al .",

    "thus , from equations ( 8)  ( 10 ) : @xmath75 to compute the mass of oxygen in the parent body , we assume this element is carried in water and oxides .",

    "one possibility is that the hydrogen was accreted previous to the era when the currently orbiting disk was formed .",
    "this earlier accretion could have been from either one large parent body or a swarm of asteroids . alternatively ,",
    "one event may account for all of gd 362 s distinctive properties , and using the formalism of @xmath29 , we now describe such a model .",
    "the observational constraints to be matched are the observed atmospheric abundances of hydrogen and detected elements heavier than oxygen contributing at least 1% of the accreted mass , and the upper limits to the mass accretion rate and the atmospheric oxygen abundance .",
    "as in the earth ( palme & oneill 2004 ) , we assume that within the parent body , aluminum , magnesium , silicon and calcium are contained in the oxides mgo , al@xmath53o@xmath91 , sio@xmath53 and cao while iron and nickel are largely metallic .",

    "how can we better understand the parent body or bodies accreted onto gd 362 ? since the mass of the main - sequence progenitor to gd 362 was @xmath23 m@xmath97 ( kilic et al .",
    "2008b ) , the thermal history of its planet - forming nebula and resulting planetesimals and planets likely were different from that of the solar nebula .",
    "this might account for the relatively high abundance of calcium in gd 362 s polluted photosphere . in any case our unified model for gd 362 s pollution with the assumption that magnesium , aluminum , silicon and calcium are contained within oxides could be falsified with better measurement of the star s elemental abundances , particularly oxygen and silicon . also ,",
    "relative to the sun , the earth is deficient in volatiles like chlorine , sulfur and phosphorus by factors of @xmath210 to @xmath2100 ( palme & oneill 2004 ) .",
    "measurements of the abundances of these volatile elements could help clarify the origin and evolution of the parent body responsible for polluting gd 362 .",
    "it is possible that the atmospheric hydrogen in gd 362 was derived from the accretion of many small asteroids rather than one single large object .",
    "the indicated minimum mass of the accreted material onto gd 362 of @xmath210@xmath98 g is much larger than the total mass of 2 @xmath17 10@xmath49 g of the solar system s asteroid belt ( binzel et al .",
    ". however , an asteroid belt orbiting the a3v star @xmath99 lep could be as massive as 4 @xmath17 10@xmath98 g ( chen & jura 2001 ) and such a system could supply the required mass .",
    "there exists evidence for the destruction of massive rocky bodies in extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "the main - sequence stars bd + 20 307 and hd 23514 have circumstellar dust ( song et al .",
    "2005 , rhee et al .",
    "2008 ) that likely resulted from collisions of parent bodies of @xmath210@xmath98 g ( rhee et al .",
    "ashwell et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have proposed that the main - sequence f - type star j37 in the open cluster ngc 6633 has accreted approximately 10@xmath98 g of material from a disrupted planet .",
    "a plausible model for the formation of the moon is that a mars - mass planetesimal collided with earth when the solar system had an age of @xmath2 25  30 myr ( canup 2004 ) .",
    "after a planetary system s orbits have been drastically re - arranged during the agb phase mass loss , plausibly , there could be a late perturbation of a mars - mass planet .",
    "if the disk persists for @xmath210@xmath27 yr , even very rare events might be salient .",
    "the scenario that the disk orbiting gd 362 is the result of the tidal - destruction of a mars - mass planet is quite different from the suggestion by reach et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that the disk orbiting g29 - 38 might be debris from the core of a jovian - mass planet that was engulfed during the agb phase of the star s evolution .",
    "the amount of hydrogen in gd 362 s mixing layer is a factor of @xmath210@xmath28 less than the mass of jupiter .",
    "therefore there must have been very efficient but fine - tuned removal of the bulk of a jovian planet while retaining the rocky core if such a model is to explain gd 362 s pollution .",
    "we have raised the possibility that gd 362 has accreted from a parent body with a mass at least as large as 10@xmath98 g. if a tidally - disurpted disk was formed and the dissipation time was as short as 10@xmath28 yr ( jura 2008 , kilic et al .",
    "2008b ) , then the accretion rate of 3 @xmath17 10@xmath100 g s@xmath19 produced an x - ray luminosity of @xmath2 5 @xmath17 10@xmath101 erg s@xmath19 .",
    "single white dwarfs typically have x - ray luminosities less than 10@xmath52 erg s@xmath19 ( odwyer et al . 2003 ) , but there might be rare exceptions that could be diagnostic of accretion of a large parent body .",
    "our new x - ray and infrared data are consistent with the scenario that gd 362 and g29 - 38 are polluted by accretion of material from their circumstellar disks .",
    "gd 362 also has an anomalously large mass of hydrogen .",
    "one possibility is that before the current disk was formed , gd 362 was bombarded either by a swarm of ceres - mass asteroids or by a single large object . an alternative model to explain simultaneously all of this star s distinctive properties is that we are witnessing the consequences of the tidal - destruction of a single parent body at least as massive as callisto and probably as massive as mars .",
