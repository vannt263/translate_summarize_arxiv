    "diquark condensation in the strong interaction ground states at asymptotically high baryon density is a very like possibility @xcite since the dominant one gluon exchange interaction between quarks in such a situation is attractive in the color triplet channel which causes the bcs instability @xcite at the fermi surface for the quarks . at zero and low densities compared to the nuclear saturation",
    "one , the study of the phenomenon in qcd , now called _ color superconductivity _ , is more difficult due to the fact that one has to deal with non - perturbative and finite density effects .",
    "it is quite apparent that the strong interaction vacuum is not color superconducting at the present day condition in a large and uniform region in space since color is known to be confined .",
    "the following question can nevertheless be asked : _ how far away ( in energy density ) is certain type of metastable color superconducting phase , called a virtual phase , of the hadronic vacuum from the stable one at the present day condition?_. it is speculated in refs .",
    "@xcite that certain kind of color superconducting phase exists , which has an energy density close to that of the normal phase for the strong interaction vacuum in which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down .",
    "whether of not such a speculation reflects reality is not a question that can be easily answered theoretically based on qcd since unlike at high densities , the qcd lagrangian at low density is dominated by non - perturbative effects .",
    "lattice study of qcd at finite density is still facing difficulties .",
    "the properties of color superconducting phases inside a nuclear matter with low or intermediate baryonic density was investigated in the literature based on four fermion interaction models @xcite , which start in the early 90s and on instanton motivated models @xcite recently , which is currently actively studied .",
    "however model studies will not be able to determine with confidence when does certain kind of color superconductivity will appear as the density increases .",
    "the question can be answered using experimental means at high energy due to the fact that for high energy processes , which probe the small distance properties of the hadronic system , even a close by metastable vacuum phase can contribute due to non - perturbative quantum fluctuations that sample the contributions from the quasiparticles of the metastable phase of the vacuum @xcite .",
    "direct detection of the virtual phase of the vacuum on the vacuum state itself is very difficult if possible at all .",
    "certain finite hadronic system is needed to serve as a medium in order for significant effects of the possible color superconducting virtual phase of the strong interaction vacuum state to manifest .",
    "one of the best hadronic systems for that purpose is a single nucleon . besides the theoretical simplicity of a nucleon ,",
    "this is also mainly due to the fact that a nucleon much better known experimentally compared to a heavy nucleus so that anormalies with less uncertainties can be found . on the contrary , our combined theoretical and experimental knowledge about a heavy nucleus a lot fuzzy for our purpose .",
    "the effects of the possible virtual color superconducting phase of the hadronic vacuum state can be observed as long as the virtual phase is close enough to the stable normal phase for hadronic systems at zero density and temperature .",
    "this is due to the fact that the concentration of matter / energy inside of a nucleon generate significant signal which is going to be discussed in detailed in the sequel .",
    "a nucleon in either of the above mentioned situations is called a `` superconducting nucleon '' in the rest of the paper .",
    "it should not be confused with the naive pictures , which require that there is in fact a true color superconducting phase or there are certain kind of bound state of diquark or quark  quark clustering inside of a nucleon , which , despite of the fact that are frequently used , may be disfavored theoretically @xcite .",
    "albeit this later extreme pictures are logically covered by this paper they are not neccessary ones ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "work in the above mentioned direction had been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , which lead us to belief that there could be in fact a close by virtual color superconducting phase for the strong interaction vacuum .",
    "this work provides a more systematic and model independent study of the possibility .",
    "since color is confined in nature at the present day condition , it is extremely difficult , if possible at all , to measure the color conductivity induced phenomenon of the hadronic systems to make a direct assessment concerning whether or not a color superconducting phase is contributing or not in a given hadronic system . on the other hand , the electromagnetic ( em ) superconductivity of a system can be probed using electrically charged particles like charged leptons and hadrons since the electromagnetic charge is not confined .",
    "an earlier study were carried out @xcite concerning the high energy em properties of a nucleon if it is superconducting in the above mentioned sense .",
    "the investigation is continued into the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes of leptons and nucleons here by trying to explain , in an essentially model independent way , a collection of old and new anomalies about the nucleon in a logically coherent way .",
    "these anomalies are about the peculiar behavior of the elusive `` pomeron '' in hadron ",
    "hadron collision and in dis at small bjorken scaling variable @xmath0 and in certain exclusive processes .",
    "the purpose of this work is not to contradict the current explanations of some these problems in perturbative qcd .",
    "it tries to provide a complementary view , based on regge theory for strong interaction , about the physical processes in the intersection area of soft and hard scattering kinematic region . since this work , which contains no detailed approximate computational scheme and model information , only provides constraints due to symmetry considerations that any work which properly implements the symmetries considered is expected to arrive at basically the same results .",
    "the small @xmath0 region of the nucleon structure function , where the perturbative qcd calculation is no longer strictly valid , is an intersection region in which both the perturbative and the non - perturbative phenomena play their role .",
    "we do not understand the non - perturbative qcd well enough from a first principle point of view due to the lack of an effective and practical scheme to tackle the problem .",
    "we do have , however , a phenomenologically successful one based on regge asymptotics , which determines the power law behavior of the hadronic scattering amplitude in the large energy limits that tells us something about the small and large @xmath0 behavior of the structure function . due to the constraint imposed by unitarity , the physical hadronic amplitudes are bounded from above by the froissart bound which requires that the total hadron  hadron scattering cross section @xmath1 with @xmath2 the total energy .",
    "the reggeon exchanged that is responsible for a behavior like @xmath3 is called the soft pomeron with an effective intercept of @xmath4 . a high energy virtual photon interacts with the nucleon through a coupling to the charged quarks inside the nucleon .",
    "since quarks are the basic building block of the nucleon , it is quite natural to assume that the virtual photon and nucleon compton scattering amplitude respect the hadronic froissart bound too , provided that the possible final state phase space of these two reactions is of the same nature .    the recent experimental observation in lepton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell  yan processes involving a nucleon made it possible to extract the unpolarized as well as polarized structure functions @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite respectively at small @xmath0 with large momentum transfer @xmath7 , the flavor unsymmetry of the nucleon sea quark distribution @xcite and the charge symmetry breaking strength @xcite .",
    "the observed rapid rise of the structure functions in the small @xmath0 region was unexpected from a straight forward extrapolation of the perturbative qcd pictures @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the soft pomeron can not provide the rapid rise of @xmath5 at small @xmath0 @xcite either . instead ,",
    "for a @xmath8 scattering , there is a transition region in the photon energy of order @xmath9 after which the so called hard pomeron with an intercept of @xmath10 seems to be needed in order the reproduce the data @xcite .",
    "such a behavior can not continue all the way down to @xmath11 if the hard pomeron is of hadronic nature since it would lead to a violation of froissart bound due to unitarity .",
    "therefore although two gluon model of the hard pomeron based on the qcd evolutoin equations is capable of giving the proper rise of gluon density at small @xmath0 @xcite , the above mentioned unitarity problem remains in such an approach .",
    "although it can be argued that the true strong interaction asymptotics is still far from our current accessible energy scale , the physics dictated by the qcd bfkl evolution equation may not be the whole story for the small @xmath0 physics for reasons not related to its apparent violation of the froissard bound @xcite .",
    "the observation that the center line of the flavor asymmetry can not fully account for the violation of the gottfried sum rule @xcite means that there seems to be less than three valence quarks inside a nucleon @xcite when interpretated in a straight forward way . where is the missing quark number ?",
    "the charge symmetry breaking in the nucleon structure function obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite also needs to be explained .",
    "the nucleon structure function @xmath5 extracted from high precision neutrino dis on a nucleon @xcite disagree with the one extracted from the charged lepton dis on the same nucleon at small @xmath0 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "it is still not clear what is the origin of this difference , which could be caused by experimental systematic errors or it could be of physical in nature as anticipated in ref .",
    "if the later possibility is true , then how can such a behavior be understood ?",
    "in a recent analysis of experimental data , the vector current conservation is in question @xcite .",
    "can such a situation be incorporated into the normal picture of hadronic system without certain drastic changes to our faith to symmetries ? why does the polarized structure function seems to change so rapidly which is reported in ref . @xcite and implied in ref .",
    "@xcite at small @xmath0 that no theory @xcite seems can explain its origin at the present ?    admittedly , any individual piece of experimental information available at the present may not be sufficiently accurate to lead to a final conclusion , a coherent theoretical study of a collection of them is expected to provide at least a stronger motivation for us to deepen our understanding of the problem both theoretically and experimentally .",

    "the elucidation of the physical processes behind the spontaneous breaking of fundamental local gauge symmetries provides an important step for not only the construction of fundamental theories of nature , like the successful standard model of electroweak interaction , but also the further understanding of the physical properties of the superconducting phase of certain condensed matter systems .",
    "the historical development is covered in ref .",
    "the discussion of the spontaneous breaking of the em gauge symmetry and that of the color @xmath15 gauge symmetry in the color superconducting phase along the traditional lines are given , e.g. , in refs .",
    "however the current understanding of such a process , as it is briefly described in the following subsection , stops at the situation in which the whole charge for the local symmetry involved are spontaneously broken . with the deepening of our knowledge about the structure of matter , especially the hadronic systems ,",
    "new situations emerge in which the above mentioned mechanism becomes no longer suitable .",
    "they arise because the charges for the corresponding fundamental local symmetries can be decomposed as a superposition of various components that generate certain global symmetries of the system .",
    "a familiar example is the electric charge of a fundamental particle like a quark or a lepton .",
    "it can be written generically as @xmath16 in standard model , where @xmath17 is the baryon number contribution to the total electric charge , @xmath18 is the lepton number contribution and @xmath19 is the isospin charge contribution , etc .",
    "it is possible that the ground or vacuum state of the system does not break the whole charge @xmath20 but only its certain component which generates global rather than local symmetry transformations , like part of the baryonic charge @xmath17 of the system .",
    "in such a case @xcite , the electromagnetic gauge symmetry is said to be _ spontaneously partial broken_.    but before embarking on understanding the physical processes behind the spontaneous partial breaking of a local gauge symmetry , let us briefly review the relatively well known higgs mechanism for the spontaneous full breaking of a gauge symmetry .",
    "the gauge transformation in a system possessing the corresponding gauge symmetry can be classified into two categories 1 ) the gauge transformation of the first kind and 2 ) that of the second kind .",
    "consider the simplest case of @xmath13 locally symmetric gauge theories .",
    "the symmetry transformations of the first kind correspond to global ones generated by the charge operator @xmath21 of the system ; the transformations of the second kind corresponding to local realization of the global ones are generated by the gauss operator @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the charge density operator and @xmath24 is the `` electric '' field operator .",
    "the existence of a local gauge symmetry of the theory is characterized by the existence of a superselection sector in the hilbert space of the system , which is called the space of physical states @xmath25 , within which the matrix elements of @xmath26 vanish , namely @xmath27 due to the local gauge symmetry of the system , the superselection sector @xmath28 remains invariant during the time evolution of the system-no transition from and to the other sectors of the hilbert space @xmath29 , which are called the subspace of unphysical states , is present .    in case of the gauge symmetry of the system",
    "is spontaneously broken down , the vacuum state is not annihilated by the charge operator @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 leading to massless goldstone boson excitation of the symmetry breaking according to the goldstone theorem .",
    "these goldstone bosons do not belong to the physical superselection sector defined by eq .",
    "[ phys - state1 ] of the corresponding local gauge theory so that the otherwise long range force generated by the goldstone bosons corresponding to a spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry of the first kind are actually absent in physical processes due to the existence of the corresponding symmetry of the second kind generated by eq .",
    "[ u1q2 ] . from the definition of the physical states",
    ", it can be shown that the goldstone bosons , generated by acting upon the vacuum state by the total charge operator , belong to the subspace of unphysical states @xmath29 . therefore the massless goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry transformations of the first kind are absent in the physical processes due to the gauge symmetry .",
    "the process of decoupling of the world - be goldstone bosons is often called the higgs mechanism in high energy physics .    this mechanism can be presented in a way different from the more familiar text - book discussion of the higgs mechanism , which is based upon a lagrangian with higgs fields appearing at the tree - level .",
    "we are interested not only in such a possibility , but also the possibility that the `` higgs '' particles are not elementary ones but composite excitations of the system that are absent at the tree - level .",
    "for that purpose , a vertex functional representation is more appropriate .",
    "as it is known , if a symmetry of the first kind is spontaneously broken , then , the corresponding goldstone bosons appear in the vector current vertex of fermions , which is required by the ward  takahashi identity relating the divergence of the vector current to the self - energy of the fermions in the system @xcite . in this case , the charge of the fermion is only partially concentrated on the fermionic ( quasi-)particle , which forms a charge core , the rest of the charge is spreaded around it due to the existence of the massless world - be goldstone boson .",

    "namely , the scattering amplitude @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 which is generated by `` less '' charge ( compared to that of the original free fermions ) .",

    "the electric charge density operator can be decomposed in the same way .",
    "although the symmetry generated by @xmath71 has an associated local gauged one with a superselection sector of physical states , its components do not always has a local symmetry attached to them .",
    "if there is a spontaneous breaking down of a ( global ) symmetry corresponding to any one component of the electric charge , then the associated goldstone bosons do not necessarily belongs to the subspace of unphysical states ( for the em gauge symmetry ) and they are expected to participate in the physical scattering processes in certain reaction channels .",
    "the goldstone bosons still can has certain overlap with the physical superselection sector for the em gauge symmetry in the hilbert space of the system after the unphysical component is projected out using eq.[phys - state1 ] .",
    "as it is discussed above , the goldstone boson for a single charge system is not a physical excitation .",
    "the effective excitation that mediates the interaction between the charged particles is a massive vector boson .",

    "[ eq3 ] ) .",

    "the energy dependence of the @xmath194 electroproduction follows that of the soft pomeron dominance in the observation .",
    "this is expected even in the symmetry breaking case .",
    "the rapid increase of the @xmath196 and @xmath197 production cross section @xcite that is dominated by the hard pomeron can be incorporated in the current scenario if the partial em gauge symmetry breaking for a nucleon is assumed .",
    "this is due to the fact that like a lepton , the strange and charm quarks contain no nucleon number .",
    "they do not couple to the goldstone boson from em @xmath13 symmetry breaking .",
    "the effective em coupling of strange and charm quark to the up and down quark sector contains a strong interaction component",
    "the current experimental data on the @xmath342 collision production of mesons seems to indicate @xcite that the soft pomeron transforms as a vector that couples to the a non - conserving current .",
    "this is a natural consequences of the scenario proposed here if one assumes that there is a spontaneous em gauge symmetry partial breaking phase for a nucleon .",
    "this is because if the soft pomeron behaves like a photon , then only the non - conserving core component of the em charge current in the color superconducting phase contribute to the observables , as it is discussed above .",
    "the scenario proposed in this work depends on the assumption that there is a nucleon long before the experimental processes take place . for those @xmath343 creation processes like in the @xmath344 collision in the vacuum , the time for the initial @xmath345 creation is expected to be much faster than the collective multi - particle processes to let the excited system to cool to its ground state containing the observed @xmath343 pairs , in which the possible superconducting phase is formed .",
    "so , the proposed hard pomeron behavior should not appear @xcite .",
    "this is indeed observed behavior @xcite .",
    "the possibility to search for a close - by metastable color superconducting phase for the strong interaction vacuum state in the presence of a nucleon is studied .",
    "it is shown that the metastable color superconducting phase of the strong interaction vacuum state can manifest itself in high energy semi - leptonic neutral current electroweak interaction processes involving a nucleon through a mechanism of `` spontaneous partial breaking '' of the em @xmath346 gauge symmetry that is independent of any mass scale .    in order to achieve this",
    ", the physical processes in a system in which the em gauge symmetry is spontaneously partial broken leading to color superconductivity is studied model independently .",
    "it is found that due the fact that the electric charge of quarks is fractional of the charge of a proton and is flavor dependent , the spontaneous partial breaking of the em gauge symmetry in the hadronic sector caused by a diquark condensation also breaks the global baryon number conservation .",
    "the em gauge symmetry is only spontaneously partial broken in such a case where the goldstone bosons corresponding to the global symmetry breaking is not unphysical states in all channels of the reaction .",
    "it is also shown that for a system in which the em gauge symmetry is spontaneously partial broken , due to the medium effects , the final phase space in a high energy semi - leptonic process contains an extra subspace compared to the allowed one due to the froissart bound for the high energy nucleon ",
    "nucleon scattering .",
    "such an extra subspace can be considered as spanned by the ( lack of ) goldstone bosons of the the spontaneous global symmetry breaking which induces the spontaneous partial breaking of the em gauge symmetry .",
    "it is found here that to explain some of the puzzling behavior of the nucleon structure functions at small @xmath0 , the violation of the gdh sum rule , the meson production in exclusive semi - leptonic dis and the current non - conservation in the meson production in high energy proton ",
    "proton collisions , the assumption that a nucleon is superconducting needs to be made .",
    "the spin structure functions of the nucleons at small @xmath0 is perhaps the most sensitive ones to study the spontaneous partial breaking of em gauge symmetry inside a nucleon due to the presence of a very singular component in the experimental observables @xmath347 and @xmath348 , which was seen in the most recent data at @xmath0 as low as @xmath325 for @xmath349 .",
    "the magnitude of the effects of the spontaneous partial breaking of the em gauge symmetry observed in the em properties of a nucleon at high energies , if proven true , means that there is at least one color superconducting metastable phase for the hadronic vacuum state with low enough energy density that can be turned into the stable one at relatively low density ( compared to the nuclear saturation density ) rather than at high densities . because of the simplicity of the single nucleon system , the signal for the possible color superconducting phase of the vacuum state is relatively clear to allow a further more detailed experimental study in the existing and planed facilities measuring the high energy em and neutral current weak responses of a nucleon at small @xmath7 and at small @xmath0 .",
    "it must be emphasized that the results of this paper and earlier related ones , which concern with the virtual phases of the vacuum state , does neither uniquely imply nor disfavor the popular diquark model or quark  quark clustering model for a nucleon .",
    "these models are based on hypothetical binding / clustering between a pair of valence quarks inside a nucleon .",
    "such a binding / clustering at valence level has no direct relation to the conclusion draw here .",
    "in fact a model for a nucleon can be build without any quark ",
    "quark clustering even in the presence of a virtual color superconducting phase for the vacuum @xcite .",
