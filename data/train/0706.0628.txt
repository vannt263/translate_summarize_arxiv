    "the thermodynamic properties of the random field ising model ( rfim ) remains the controversial issue during more that 30 years now ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "traditionally there are exist three somewhat independent mainstreams of reseach : theoretical , numerical and experimental . inside each of them , as well as between any of them , one finds broad divergences in the obtained results and in their interpretations .",
    "the main issue of this controversy is the structure of the phase diagram of the system : what kind of phase transitions and which thermodynamic phases are present there ?    the random field model has been proposed originally by larkin @xcite to model the defect pining of vortices in sumerconductors .",
    "the most simple version of the this model for systems with discrete ising symmetry , the random field ising model ( rfim ) , can be described in terms of the hamiltonian    [ rfim0 ] h = - _ < i , j>^n _ i _ j - _",
    "i where the ising spins @xmath2 are placed in the vertices of a d - dimensional lattice with the ferromagnetic interactions between the nearest neighbors , and quenched random fields @xmath3 are described either by the symmetric gaussian distribution with @xmath4 , or by the binary distribution in which the fields are taking two values @xmath5 with independent probabilities at each site .",
    "the first round of controversies in the studies of rfim was about its lower critical dimension . according to simple energy ballace physical arguments by imry and ma @xcite it should be expected that the dimensions @xmath6 above which the ferromagnetic ground state is stable at low temperatures ( it is called the lower critical dimension ) must be @xmath7 ( unlike the pure ising systems where @xmath8 ) .",
    "later , the existence of the ferromagnetic long range order in the 3d rfim has been confirmed by a rigorous proof @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a perturbative renormalization group study of the phase transition demonstrates the so called phenomenon of a dimensional reduction , such that the critical exponents of the random field system in the dimension d appear to be the same as those of the ferromagnetic system without random fields in the dimension d = d-2 @xcite , which implies that the lower critical dimension of the random field ising model must be equal to 3 , in contradiction with the rigorous results .",
    "actually , the procedure of summation of the leading large scale divergences assumes that the hamiltonian has only one minimum .",
    "however , one can easily see that as soon as the temperature is close enough to the putative critical point ( as well as in the whole low temperature region ) , there are local values of the magnetic fields for which the free energy has more than one minimum @xcite , and therefore the dimensional reduction is not grounded .",
    "thus , the above arguments have settled the controversy about the lower critical dimension of the random field ising model in favor of the value @xmath7 .",
    "phase diagram in the ( h , t ) plane for the rf ising system has been first derived in terms of simple mean - field theory for the model with infinite - range ferromagnetic interactions ( which corresponds to infinite space dimensionality ) with the gaussian distribution of random fields @xcite . in this system",
    "the ferromagnetic phase is separated from the paramagnetic phase by a line @xmath9 of the second order phase transition which monotonically decreases with @xmath1 from the point @xmath10 of the pure system , down to the ending point @xmath11 at @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "for the bimodal distribution @xcite one finds that the line @xmath13 contains a tricritical point @xmath14 , such that at @xmath15 the phase transition becomes the first order . later on a simple scaling description of the rfim phase transition in finite dimensions has been developed assuming that it is of the second order , and that it is controlled by the zero - temperature fixed point @xcite .    as another extreme case , instead of",
    "the ising spins , one can study the @xmath16-component vector spin system ( the ising model corresponds to @xmath17 ) with gaussian random fields .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that in terms of the replica field theory in the limit @xmath18 the statistics of interfaces in this system is described by the solution with broken replica symmetry ( similar to that in spin glasses @xcite ) which is consistent with the low critical dimension @xmath19 . later on in the same limit @xmath18 it has been demonstrated @xcite the instability of the replica symmetric state and the onset of the replica symmetry breaking scenario . in terms of this approach",
    "it has been argued that in the phase diagram of the three - dimensional rfim the the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases are separated by the glassy phase in which the replica symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "an independent study of the @xmath20 replica field theory ( which in the critical region is believed to describe rfim ) in terms of the legendre transforms technique and the virial - like relations also shows the presence of the intermediate rsb glassy phase below dimensions @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "further renormalization - group ( rg ) study of this field theory in dimensions @xmath22 revealed no stable fixed points signalling the nonset of the replica symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "another line of theoretical studies concerns the non - perturbative thermodynamic states which are apparently missing in the usual rg calculations and which may appear to be quite relevant for the nature of the phase transition in rfim .",
    "the importance of the non - perturbative phenomena has been noted already long time ago @xcite . in physical terms , the non - perturbative configurations are rare spatial regions with `` flipped '' ( opposite to the background ) magnetizations , and in terms of the replica field theory they are described by localized in space finite energy instanton configurations in which the replica symmetry is broken . in the recent investigations",
    "a systematic approach for the calculation of the non - perturbative contributions has been developed @xcite and it has been shown that from the point of view of their relevance the dimension @xmath23 turns out to be marginal : formally these degrees of freedom produce finite ( non - analytic in the strength of the field @xmath1 ) contribution only in dimensions @xmath24 @xcite .    finally , the construction of an alternative approach , the functional renormalization group , which is supposed to take into account all non - perturbative degrees of freedom for the whole class of the random - field @xmath25 spin model is under way these very days @xcite      numerical investigations of the phase transition in rfim reveal broad controversy in the obtained results and in particular in their interpretation .",
    "the main point of the disagreements is about the nature if the phase transition : is it continuous , or is it of first order with finite jump of the order parameter .",
    "originally , the analysis of the high - temperature series expansion for the rfim with the gaussian distribution of random fields @xcite indicated on the existence of a fluctuation - driven first order phase transition at sufficiently strong disorder below four dimensions ( which suggests the existence of a tricritical point in the three - dimensional system ) .",
    "however more recent study indicated on the continuous transition , at leas for weak disorder @xcite .",
    "first extensive monte carlo ( mc ) numerical simulations for the 3d rfim have been carried out by young and nauenberg @xcite , who reported that the transition may be first order . on the other hand , the numerical study by ogielski and huse @xcite , and by ogielski",
    "@xcite shows that the transition may be second order .",
    "more recent monte carlo simulations @xcite can also been interpreted as describing a continuous transition but with a finite jump in the magnetization .",
    "however , later extensive mc calculations @xcite for the energy and the magnetization distributions suggest a first order transition .",
    "the zero - temperature studies play an important role in understanding the nature of the phase transition in the rfim . according to the zero temperature fixed point hypothesis ,",
    "the transitions which take place at @xmath11 and at @xmath26 are in the same universality class .",
    "first zero - temperature migdal - kadanoff renormalization - group calculations indicated a continuous transition which is characterized by very small value of the magnetization critical exponent ( @xmath27 ) @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained in the finite temperature renormalization group study @xcite . on the other hand , some of more recent zero - temperature finite size scaling calculations @xcite have demonstrated the existence of a first order phase transition , although most of the them @xcite are in favor of the continuous transition .",
    "moreover , in one of the most recent calculations it has been demonstrated that for a given realization of disorder the ground states ( @xmath11 ) and thermal states ( @xmath26 ) near the critical line are strongly correlated , which may be interpreted as the concrete manifestation of the zero temperature fixed point scenario @xcite .",
    "the most precise results obtained by a.a.middleton and d.s.fisher @xcite are clearly consistent with the existence of a single phase transition ( no intermediate spin - glass phase has been observed ) and it is characterized by very small value of the magnetization critical exponent @xmath28 .",
    "others numerical studies of the phase diagram of the rfim in the plane @xmath29 @xcite , also find no glassy phase ( with or without replica symmetry breaking ) which would separate paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases .",
    "on the other hand , for the bimodal random field distributions a discontinuity in the magnetization at the phase transition line is observed @xcite .",
    "finally , the numerical simulations of the diluted antiferromagnet in a field ( daff ) designed to imitate the random field magnetic systems which are studied experimentally ( see below ) , shows that in equilibrium , the transition to the lro state may be first order @xcite , and moreover it is claimed that at sufficiently strong dilution there is first order phase transition to a spin glass state @xcite    to conclude this brief survey of numerical studies , it should be noted that all numerical simulations in rfim are impeded by the dramatic slowing down when approaching a putative phase transition , which very often makes very difficult to interpret the obtained results . besides , the delicate point in all these studies is that the order parameter critical exponent @xmath30 turns out to be very small , so it is very difficult to distinguish the second order transition ( for which the order parameter continuously goes to zero at @xmath31 ) from the first order ( when the order parameter has a finite jump at @xmath31 ) .",
    "on top of that , recent numerical study of the critical region of the 3d rfim indicates that the situation could be even more sophisticated due to absence of self - averaging of the correlation length , of the specific heat , and maybe of some others thermodynamical quantities @xcite .      from the point of view of experimental investigations",
    "an important theoretical breakthrough occurred when it has been realized that rfim can be generated in diluted ising antiferromagnets by application of a _ uniform _ external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this has opened the way for experimental studies of rfim , and in particular for the investigation of the phase transition .    in the very first experimental studies of the rfim performed in the diluted antiferromagnets",
    "@xmath32 it has been claimed that even the smallest magnetic fields destroy the long - range order at all temperatures in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "first convincing experimental demonstrations of the existence of the phase transition in the 3d random field antiferromagnet @xmath33 and its critical properties ( assuming that it is of second order ) has been reported in @xcite .",
    "the extensive study of the critical properties of the system @xmath34 for temperatures @xmath35 has been done in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the behavior observed near the critical point depends on the field and temperature procedures used in the measurements . in",
    "the field cooled ( fc ) samples the transition appears to be rounded , and at low temperatures the system freezes in the metastable domain state .",
    "however , if the sample is cooled in the zero field ( zfc ) , the transition appears to be much sharper , and rounded only by slow dynamic effects @xcite .    on the other hand , in another experimental study of the 3d rfim ( for weakly anisotropic @xmath36 ) @xcite",
    "it has been observed that when approaching the phase transition the correlation length reaches a finite size , at which point it was assumed that further approach towards a putative second order transition is interrumpted by occurrence of a first order transition .",
    "the most slippery issue of the experimental studies of the phase transition in the rfim is the measurement of the static critical behavior of the staggered magnetization . similarly to the numerical studies , the fact that critical exponent @xmath30 is experimentally very small ( e.g. according to @xcite @xmath37 or less , according to @xcite @xmath38 ) makes it very difficult to work out any definite conclusion about the nature of the observed phase transition .    in the studies of the diluted antiferromagnet @xmath39",
    "the field - cooled data were interpreted as the evidence for an equilibrium second - order transition at@xmath40 , while the zero - field cooled data were interpreted as non - equilibrium _",
    "trompe loeil _ transition in which the long - range order diminishes continuously at @xmath41 , while the correlation length only reaches a finite maximum value at a temperature between @xmath42 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "similar behavior was observed in @xmath43 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "all these results can be explained as the mean - field first - order transition broadened by the cluster - flipping mechanism @xcite .    in the study of",
    "the random field antiferromagnet @xmath43 a notable broadening of the phase transition region has been observed , so that the data may be described by the gaussian distribution of effective transition temperatures with the width which scales with the strength of the applied field as @xmath44 @xcite . besides , the apparent critical behavior observed in these measuremets represented a continuous evolution from metastable behavior towards equilibrium behavior .",
    "moreover , according to the point of view of birgeneau @xcite , so far no true equilibrium phase transition has been observed in rfim systems .",
    "nevertheless , in the recent study of high - magnetic concentration ising antiferromagnet @xmath45 ( which does not exhibit the severe critical scattering hysteresis @xcite ) it is claimed that in terms of general scaling assumptions the critical scattering analysis allows to reveal equilibrium critical behavior and to obtain the corresponding critical exponents @xcite ( in particular the specific heat critical behavior is well fitted by the logarithmic singularity which corresponds to @xmath46 @xcite ) .    in conclusion of this brief historic review",
    "one can note that the situation with the phase transition in the three - dimensional rfim remains far from being clear .",
    "theorists are mostly interested in their own problems ( like @xmath47 expansion , or rsb in dimensions close to 6 , or two - loop approximation for @xmath25 sigma model with the number of spin components close to @xmath48 ) , which are rather far from the original system , while people doing numerics and in particular experiments are facing realities full of numerous secondary and accessory effects which very often overshadow the main physical phenomena .",
    "it is evident that one can not hope to find the exact solution for this problem , and therefore some kind of simplifications and approximations are unavoidable . in this paper , which is mostly devoted to the low - temperature part of the phase diagram",
    ", it will be supposed that : * ( a ) * the finite temperature thermodynamical properties of the three - dimensional rfim can be described in terms of the continuous ginzburg - landau @xmath20 field theory ; * ( b ) * we can neglect the presence of randomness in the spin - spin interactions ; and * ( c ) * in the study of the _ zero - temperature _ phase transition ( at variation of the strength of the random fields ) all thermally activated processes are suppressed .",
    "the above reservations are rather essential .    * ( a ) ginzburg - landau field theory*. we all _ believe _ in the universality , and therefore if we admit that the phase transition in a given system is of the second order , then it is generally accepted that its critical properties can be described in terms of the corresponding ginzburg - landau hamiltonian ( with proper symmetry properties ) . however , if the system is considered at a _",
    "finite _ distance from the putative critical point ( which is the case in the present paper ) where the correlation length is finite , then the relevance of the _ continuous limit _",
    "ginzburg - landau hamiltonian for the original lattice ising system becomes much less evident .    *",
    "( b ) randomness in the spin - spin interactions*. apart from the numerical investigations of daff @xcite , the effects of randomness in the spin - spin interactions is practically never taken into account in theoretical studies ( there are enough headache due to random fields ... ) .",
    "however , it is well known that the presence of this type of randomness ( without random fields ) may change the critical properties of a magnetic system , and in particular it definitely does in the three - dimensional ising model . moreover , in some statistical systems ( e.g. in the potts model ) the presence of such disorder may turn the first - order transition ( of the pure system ) into the second order one @xcite . therefore",
    ", it we admit for the moment that the phase transition in the `` pure '' ( without randomness in spin - spin interactions ) 3d rfim is of the first order , it does not guarantee that in the corresponding experimental realizations of this system ( where the randomness in the spin - spin interactions is inevitable ) the phase transition would not turn into the second order one .    *",
    "( c ) thermal activations*. in the studies of the zero - temperature properties of the system as the function of the effective strength of the random fields @xmath1 , one can consider two types of procedures . in the first one it is assumed that at any given @xmath1 the system is at the ground state ( which , at a given realization of the random fields , is assumed to be unique ) . in this case",
    "the _ variation _ of @xmath1 to a new value @xmath49 means that either we admit that the temperature is actually slightly non - zero , and the system passes to a new ground state configuration ( corresponding to @xmath49 ) via thermally activated flips , or at each variation of @xmath1 the ground state configuration is achieved by cooling down the system ( at fixed @xmath49 ) from the high - temperature disordered state .",
    "the alternative procedure of the variation of @xmath1 is essentially different .",
    "here one has to fix the _ starting _ value of @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath50 ) , and then at any variation of @xmath1 the spins are just following the directions of their local fields ( which consist of the contributions due to the regular ferromagnetic interactions with the nearest neighbors plus the local value of the random field ) . in this procedure",
    "all thermal `` jumps over energy barriers '' are prohibited , and therefore , most probably , due to the variation of @xmath1 the system will get stuck in one of the metastable states .    of course",
    ", from the experimental point of view none of these two procedures can be implemented in the pure form .",
    "the first one ( qualitatively , it corresponds to the _ field cooled _",
    "( fc ) measurements ) requires very long ( formally infinite ) waiting time to reach the thermal equilibrium at any variation of @xmath1 , while the second one ( it corresponds to the _ zero field cooled _ ( zfc ) measurements ) requires to suppress _ all _ thermally activated processes which can be achieved only if the temperature is exactly equal to zero .    in the next section using simple physical arguments it will be shown that if the strength of the random fields is not too small then there exists a region of parameters where the critical fluctuations are irrelevant , and therefore the thermodynamic properties of the system can be described in terms of the saddle - point equations of the corresponding ( random ) ginzburg - landau hamiltonian .",
    "it is in this region that the ferromagnetic order breaks down .",
    "moreover , using simple scaling arguments it will be shown that in this case the finite temperature phase transition in this system is equivalent to the low - temperature phase transition at variation of the strength of the random fields .    in section 3",
    "the detailed study of the zero - temperature order - disorder phase transition will be done in terms of the discrete ising model on the three - dimensional cubic lattice . here",
    "we propose a modified ( slightly improved ) version of the mean - field approach which takes into account nearest - neighbors two - spins correlations .",
    "then , considering the two regimes : increasing and decreasing strength of the random fields , and supposing that all thermally activated spin flips are suppressed , it will be demonstrated that the magnetization curve @xmath0 reveals the hysteresis loop .",
    "in particular , it is characterized by two different critical points @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the strength of the random fields at which @xmath0 becomes non - zero at _ decreasing _",
    "@xmath1 , and @xmath53 is the one at which @xmath0 becomes zero at _ increasing _",
    "for the sake of generality , before coming down to the dimension three , first , let us consider the continuous version of the @xmath54-dimensional ising model in terms of the scalar field ginzburg - landau hamiltonian : h@xmath55 = here @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is the reduced temperature parameter ( for simplicity in what follows it will be supposed that @xmath58 ) . according to this definition , positive values of @xmath59 correspond to the low - temperature ferromagnetic state .",
    "random fields @xmath60 are described by the symmetric gaussian distribution , p[h(*x * ) ] = p_0 ( - h^2(*x * ) )  , where @xmath1 is the parameter which describes the strength of the random field , and @xmath61 is an irrelevant normalization constant . for a given realization of the random fields the partition function of this system",
    "is obtained by the integration over all configurations of the scalar fields @xmath62    z[h(*x * ) ] = ( * x * ) ( -h@xmath55 ) it is well known that if we consider such system at temperatures not too close to the critical point ( so that the parameter @xmath59 is not too small ) the thermal critical fluctuations are irrelevant , and the leading contributions to the partition function , eq.([rfim3 ] ) , are coming from the minima of the hamiltonian , eq.([rfim1 ] ) , described by the saddle - point equation    -(*x * ) - ( * x * ) + g^3(*x * ) = h(*x * ) in the pure system ( at @xmath63 ) the restriction on the value of the parameter @xmath59 is given by the ginzburg - landau condition    g^ 2/(4-d ) _ gl it is clear that this requirement makes sense only if the coupling parameter @xmath64 is sufficiently small . of course ,",
    "formally for the three - dimensional hamiltonian , eq.([rfim1 ] ) , considered as the continuous limit representation of the original ising model this is not true ( unlike the corresponding systems in dimensions close to four , where the effective ( renormalized ) value of the coupling parameter @xmath65 ) .",
    "nevertheless , here we are going to consider the random field ginzburg - landau theory , eq.([rfim1 ] ) in which the coupling parameter @xmath64 is assumed to be sufficiently small , hoping that at the qualitative level the behavior of the system is not so much sensitive to the actual value of this parameter .",
    "the only relevant spatial scale in the system described by the hamiltonian ( [ rfim1 ] ) is the correlation length @xmath66 which under condition ( [ rfim5 ] ) has the scaling    r_c ( ) ~ ^-1/2 in the absence of the random fields the ferromagnetic ground state of the system is characterized by the homogeneous configuration @xmath67 . to study the effects produced by the random fields on the ferromagnetic state of the system",
    "let us perform the following space and fields rescaling    ( * x * ) = @xmath68 ^ 1/2 ( * x*/r_c ) , in terms of the new fields @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , the system is described by the rescaled hamiltonian    h@xmath71 = d^d z where the rescaled random fields    ( * x*/r_c ) = r_c^-d _",

    "the presence of weak random fields ( at @xmath80 ) introduces only small perturbations to this solution .",
    "however , if we increase the effective strength of @xmath76 , which is controlled by the parameter @xmath81 , eq.([rfim16 ] ) , the ferromagnetic configuration is getting more and more perturbed , and finally , at at a certain critical value @xmath82 the ferromagnetic ordering is destroyed .",
    "one can note two important points in the above scenario :    * first*. according eq.([rfim16 ] ) , for fixed value of the parameter @xmath1 ( which is the strength of the original random fields @xmath60 ) , the effective strength of the random fields @xmath76 is controlled by the temperature parameter @xmath59 . according to its definition ( @xmath83 ) , increasing the temperature @xmath84 of the system means decreasing @xmath59 , which in turn , produces increasing of the parameter @xmath81 in other words , variations in temperature turn into variations of the effective strength of the random fields .",
    "* second*. according to the saddle - point equation ( [ rfim17 ] ) the critical value of @xmath82 is of the order of one .",
    "this means that the transition takes place at    ~ _ c = ( g h^2)^ at this point the value of the effective `` inverse temperature '' parameter @xmath85 , eq.([rfim13 ] ) is    = @xmath86^ thus , if the strength of random fields is not too small :    h h_*(g ) = g^ at dimensions @xmath87 in the vicinity of the phase transition ( when @xmath88 ) we have    ~ = @xmath89^ 1 in other words , in terms of the representation , eqs.([rfim12])-([rfim16 ] ) , the original ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition at any point of the critical curve @xmath90 on the left of the point ( @xmath91 ) ( figure 1 ) is equivalent to the low - temperature order - disorder transition ( far left extreme of the curve @xmath90 ) at variation of the strength of the random fields .",
    "in particular , in the dimension @xmath92 ,    _ gl = g^2 +   + _ c = ( g h^2)^2/3 +   + = @xmath93 ^ 2/3 +   + h_*(g ) = g the conditions @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 discussed above are automatically satisfied by the only restriction on the strength of the random fields ,    h g in the next section to understand the nature of the low temperature phase transition , we are going to consider its extreme version in the _ zero temperature _ limit . in this case",
    "it is natural to consider the original discrete ising model on a lattice instead of its continuous limit representation .",
    "let us consider the three - dimensional random field ferromagnetic ising model on the cubic lattice with the hamiltonian    h = - _",
    "< j= j>^n _ i _ j - _ i^n h_i _ i here @xmath97 denotes the pairs of nearest neighbors , and the random fields @xmath98 are described by the independent gaussian distributions    w_h [ h_1 , h_2 , ... , h_n ]",

    "first , let us discuss at the qualitative level what is going on if we increase the parameter @xmath1 from zero to large values . at @xmath50",
    "the state of the system is ferromagnetic : the solution of the above equations ( [ rfim30 ] ) is trivial , @xmath103 ( of course , there is another equivalent solution @xmath104 , but in what follows we will suppose that in the ferromagnetic state the spins are directed `` up '' ) . at non - zero @xmath105",
    "almost all the spins are directed `` up '' , but in rare cases , when at a given site @xmath102 the value of the local field is sufficiently negative , @xmath106 , the @xmath102-th spin is flipped `` down '' . according to eq.([rfim29 ] ) , the probability of this event ( which is equal to the concentration of the negative spins ) is    ( h 1 ) = _ -^-1 dx _ h ( x ) = erfc@xmath107 where    erfc(z ) _ z^+ dt @xmath108 is the complementary error function ( which exponentially goes to zero at @xmath109 ) .    note that in the above consideration we have neglected the configurations in which the flipped down spins appear to be the nearest neighbors .",
    "it is clear that at small @xmath1 the concentration @xmath110 is exponentially small and therefore the probability of these events is negligible .",
    "however , when increasing the value of the parameter @xmath1 the probability to find two or more neighboring `` down '' spins becomes non - small , and it is due to these configuration that the situation becomes rather sophisticated .",
    "first of all , one can note that if at neighboring sites the values of the random fields appear to be non small ( and negative ) , then the stable spin configurations can become ambiguous . as an example let us consider two neighboring sites @xmath102 and @xmath111 ( surrounded by the spins which all are directed `` up '' ) with the values of the random fields @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "one can easily see that in this case both the configuration @xmath114 and the configuration @xmath115 satisfy the stability conditions eq.([rfim30 ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that one could find similar phenomena in clusters consisting of larger number of spins .",
    "the effects of the ambiguity of the stationary spin configurations due to the presence of the random fields and their ( non - perturbative ) contributions to the finite - temperature thermodynamics have been discussed earlier in terms of the continuous ginzburg - landau representation of the rfim @xcite . here",
    "we will describe the consequences of the ambiguity of the stationary states for the phase transition at the zero temperatures . at the qualitative level it is tempting to suggest that the presence of such kind of phenomena could be the origin of the phase transition of the first order .",
    "indeed , if at increasing the strength of the random field the system gets stuck at ferromagnetic configurations , an _ alternative _ disordered states could become energetically preferable before the ferromagnetic state would become unstable .",
    "note that unlike the second - order phase transitions which are characterized by the divergence of the correlation length ( and which require to find the way to study the system at large scales ) the first - order phase transition is characterized by a finite value of the correlation length .",
    "for that reason one can hope that taking into account correlations only of the order of the lattice spacing could still give reasonable results .",
    "first , as a matter of simple `` warming up exercise '' , let us consider how the the zero - temperature phase transition looks like if we study it in terms of the ordinary mean - field approach ( which neglects the spin - spin correlations at all ) .",

    "one can easily check that in the vicinity of the critical point , as @xmath129 , the the ferromagnetic order parameter vanishes according to the the scaling law : m(h ) ~ ( h_c - h)^ described by the usual mean - field critical exponent @xmath130 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this , of course , is not surprising because if in eq.([rfim33 ] ) we substitute @xmath131 , the resulting equation for @xmath16 ( whatever complicated it may look like ) will be still the _ mean field equation _ for the order parameter , and its development in powers of small @xmath0 in the vicinity of the critical point can not give anything else but mean - field critical exponent .",
    "it is clear that the consideration presented above can not pretend to describe the true phase transition which takes place in the system under consideration .",
    "the reason for that is obvious : in such king of the mean - field calculations one misses all spin - spin correlations , which , as we have discussed in the beginning of this section , are crucial for the statistical properties of the present system .",
    "below we are going to modify the above approach so that it would take into account correlations between pairs of nearest neighbors spins .",
    "it turns out that even such rather limited improvement is sufficient to intoduce rather dramatic changes in the scenario of the phase transition .",
    "let us consider a pair of nearest neighbor spins @xmath132 and @xmath133 and let us denote by @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 the probabilities of the @xmath138 configurations @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 correspondingly .",

    "@xmath166.,width=415 ]    as an example let us consider again the simplest situation when all ten neighboring spins are directed `` up '' ( which has the probability @xmath167 ) . in this case",
    "the condition to have both spins``up '' is @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( so that the corresponding contribution to @xmath170 must be given by the integration of @xmath152 in the sector @xmath171 ) .",

    "finally the contribution to the probability @xmath175 is given by the sector @xmath176 , which _ overlaps _ with the sector corresponding to @xmath170 .",
    "thus in the square @xmath177 we are facing a kind of frustration ( figure 5 ) .",
    "one can propose two ways out of this situation .",
    "first of all , one can , of course , compare the energies of the two configurations , and then , if the spin orientations always correspond to the ground state , the ambiguity will be lifted ( the configuration with both spins `` up '' has lower energy in the triangle above the dotted line inside the `` frustrated square '' in figure 5 , and the one with both spins `` down '' has lower energy below the dotted line ) . however ,",
    "if we keep in mind the scenario in which in the course of variations of the external parameter @xmath1 each spin just follow the direction of the local field , while all thermally activated `` jumps over barriers '' are suppressed , then we have to conclude that inside the `` frustrated '' region the orientation of the two spins must depend on the _",
    "history_. namely , for every point in the plane @xmath153 we can assign the `` trajectory '' which would demonstrate where this particular values of the random fields came from . for instance , in the situation when we study the evolution of the system for _ increasing _ value of @xmath1 , ( starting from zero ) a particular point @xmath153 has the `` trajectory '' which is the straight line connecting this point with the origin . in the opposite case of",
    "_ decreasing _ @xmath1 ( starting from infinity ) , the `` trajectory '' of the point @xmath153 is the straight line which comes from infinity and directed towards the origin .    following these rules of the game the ambiguity of the spin orientations",
    "is lifted _ provided _ one fixes which process is actually under study : increasing or decreasing of @xmath1 . in the study of the ferromagnetic @xmath178 paramagnetic transition ( increasing @xmath1 )",
    "one can easily note that the `` trajectory '' to any point inside the `` frustrated '' square @xmath177 comes from the region where both spins , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , are directed `` up '' .",
    "thus , in this case the square `` belong '' to the probability @xmath170 ( figure 6(a ) ) . in the reversed process of decreasing @xmath1 ( the paramagnetic @xmath178 ferromagnetic transition ) the only way to arrive inside this square is to come from the region where both spins are `` down '' , and in this case the square belong to the probability @xmath175 ( figure 6(b ) ) .    for better understanding how it works",
    "let us consider other examples . in the case",
    "when all 10 surrounding spins are directed `` down '' , the `` orientation diagram '' for the spins @xmath132 and @xmath133 is represented in figure 7 . here",
    "the `` frustrated square '' is located in the region @xmath179 .",
    "now , at increasing @xmath1 one arrives into this square from the region where both spins are `` down '' and therefore in this case it belongs to the probability @xmath175 ( figure 7(a ) ) . apparently , in the reversed process of decreasing @xmath1 the square belong to the probability @xmath170 ( figure 7(b ) ) .",
    "let us consider the configuration in which all 5 neighbors of the spin @xmath132 are `` up '' , while all 5 neighbors of the spin @xmath133 are `` down '' . using eqs.([rfim38 ] ) one can easily build the corresponding orientation diagram ( figure 8) .",
    "we see that in this case both at increasing and decreasing @xmath1 one can arrive into the left - down triangle of the `` frustrated square '' only by passing the region where both spins are `` down '' .",
    "similarly , both at increasing and decreasing @xmath1 one can arrive into the right - up triangle only by passing the region where both spins are `` up '' .    finally , let us consider the configuration in which all 5 neighbors of the spin @xmath132 are `` up '' , and only 4 neighbors of the spin @xmath133 are `` down '' . here",
    "the division of the `` frustrated square '' between @xmath170 and @xmath175 is somewhat more complicated ( figure 9 ) . at increasing @xmath1 one arrives into the section of the square below the line @xmath180 by passing through the region where both spins are `` down '' and one arrives into the section above this line by passing through the region where both spins are `` up '' ( figure 9(a ) ) . on the other hand , at decreasing @xmath1 one arrives into the section of the square below the line @xmath181 by passing through the region where both spins are `` down '' and one arrives into the section above this line by passing through the region where both spins are `` up '' ( figure 9(b ) ) .",
    "now , with some patience and perseverance one can construct the structure of the frustrated squares for all 36 `` analytically different '' ( in terms of eqs.([rfim38 ] ) ) configurations of the surrounding spins .",
    "the resulting orientation diagrams for increasing and decreasing @xmath1 are shown in figures 10 and 11 correspondingly .    finally , after the regions corresponding to `` up - up '' and `` up - down '' orientations of the spins @xmath132 and @xmath133 are unambiguously defined , the derivation of the equations for the probabilities @xmath182 and @xmath183 is straitforward ( although slightly cumbersome ) .",
    "the explicit forms of the equation ( [ rfim37 ] ) for increasing and for decreasing @xmath1 is given in the appendix .",
    "the solution of these equations in terms of the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath0 is represented in figure 12 .",
    "we see that the behavior of the magnetization exhibits clear hysteresis phenomenon .",
    "in this paper the zero - temperature phase transition has been studied under the assumption that at any variations of the strength @xmath1 of the random fields the transformations of the spin configurations go under constrain that all thermally activated spin flips are suppressed .",
    "it should be stressed that this situation is essentially different from the true equilibrium phase transition where at any given @xmath1 the system is supposed to be in the ground state ( and which , in my view , is experimentally inaccessible , et least in the low - temperature limit ) .    comparing two possible scenarios of the order - disorder phase transition : continuous ( the second order ) and discontinuous ( the first order )",
    ", one should note that unlike the continuous transition characterized by the divergence of the correlation length , at the first - order phase transition the correlation length remains finite .",
    "thus , admitting that the transition is discontinuous one can hope that a theory which takes into account spin - spin correlations only at a limited scale ( e.g. of the order of the lattice spacing ) still would give qualitatively correct description of the phase transition .",
    "usual mean - field theory is useless here because it does not take into account spin - spin correlations at all . on the other hand",
    ", it has been demonstarted in this paper that even rather limited improvement of the mean - field approach , which takes into account two nearest neighbor spins correlations , produces rather dramatic effect on the scenario of the phase transition . after this modification the value of the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath0 as",
    "the function of the strength of the random fields becomes _ history dependent _ exhibiting clear hysteresis phenomenon ( figure 12 ) .",
    "unfortunately in the framework of the present theory it is still difficult to to make a definite conclusion about the nature of the phase transition .",
    "the existence of the hysteresis loop ( together with the clear understanding of the physical mechanism in its origin ) is the strong argument in favor of the first - order phase transition . on the other hand , each of the curves @xmath184 ( at increasing @xmath1 ) and @xmath185 ( at decreasing @xmath1 ) in the figure 12 demonstrates the continuous transition which , of course , makes no sense , because at such transition the correlation length diverges , while the present theory takes into account the correlations only of the order of the lattice spacing . in this sense",
    "the present theory is not self - consistent , and it would be reasonable to expect that the presence of the continuous transitions at @xmath186 is not more than just an artifact of the proposed approach .",
    "these issues require further detailed studies .",
    "let us denote by @xmath187 and @xmath188 the probabilities for the two spins @xmath132 and @xmath133 to be both `` up '' at increasing and at decreasing variations of @xmath1 correspondingly .",
    "note that the probability @xmath135 is the same in both ( increasing and decreasing ) cases .",
    "then , using the orientation diagrams shown in figures 10 and 11 ( after some work ) we get :    p_+ ( ) ( x , h ) = p_6(h ) p_6(h ) x^10 + 10 p_6(h ) p_5(h ) x^9 ( 1 - x)^1 +   + + @xmath189 x^8 ( 1 - x)^2 + @xmath190 x^7 ( 1 - x)^3 +   + + x^6 ( 1 - x)^4 +   + + x^5 ( 1 - x)^5 +   + + x^4 ( 1 - x)^6 +   + + x^3 ( 1 - x)^7 +   + + x^2 ( 1 - x)^8 +   + + 10 @xmath191 x^1 ( 1 - x)^9 +   + + @xmath192 ( 1 - x)^10    p_-()(x , h ) = + = x^10 + 10 x^9 ( 1 - x)^1 + + x^8 ( 1 - x)^2 + + x^7 ( 1 - x)^3 + + x^6 ( 1 - x)^4 + + x^5 ( 1 - x)^5 + + x^4 ( 1 - x)^6 + + x^3 ( 1 - x)^7 + + @xmath193 x^2 ( 1 - x)^8 + 10 p_2(h ) p_1(h ) x^1 ( 1 - x)^9 + p_1(h ) p_1(h ) ( 1 - x)^10    p()(x , h ) = p_5(h ) p_0(h ) x^10 + @xmath194 x^9 ( 1 - x)^1 +   + + @xmath195 x^8 ( 1 - x)^2 +   + + @xmath196 x^7 ( 1 - x)^3 +   + + @xmath197 x^6 ( 1 - x)^4 +   + + @xmath198 x^5 ( 1 - x)^5 +   + + @xmath199 x^4 ( 1 - x)^6 +   + + @xmath200 x^3 ( 1 - x)^7 +   + + @xmath201 x^2 ( 1 - x)^8 +   + + @xmath202 x^1 ( 1 - x)^9 + p_0(h ) p_5(h ) ( 1 - x)^10 where the functions @xmath203 @xmath204 are defined in eq.([rfim34 ] ) and    d^(+)_51(h ) & = & _ -1 ^ -2/3 dy_1 p_h(y_1 ) _",
