    "some time ago , atiyah made the observation that hyperbolic monopoles are equivalent to circle - invariant yang - mills instantons if a discrete relationship exists between the curvature of hyperbolic space and the magnitude of the higgs field at infinity @xcite .",
    "a rich theory of hyperbolic monopoles has since developed , involving twistor correspondences to spectral curves and rational maps .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that monopoles satisfying atiyah s relationship are equivalent to a discrete nahm system called the braam - austin equations .",
    "more recently , there has been interest in explicit solutions for the simplest example of atiyah s relationship .",
    "a large class of examples with platonic symmetry was given in @xcite .",
    "explicit formulae for the spectral curves and rational maps of monopoles obtained from the jnr ansatz were obtained in @xcite , as well as more explicit solutions with platonic symmetry and some 1-parameter families with cyclic and dihedral symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we give more monopole solutions , still within the simplest example of atiyah s relationship , as well as their associated spectral curves and rational maps .",
    "the new examples were found by deforming the axial monopole adhm data while imposing judiciously chosen discrete symmetries .",
    "this approach is only possible if one has axial monopole adhm data in a particularly convenient form .",
    "it was realised some time ago @xcite that axial monopoles are readily obtainable from the jnr ansatz , although this approach is unnatural at the adhm level .",
    "here we give a different , indirect derivation of axial monopole adhm data via the braam - austin construction .",
    "the adhm data so obtained follows a simple pattern and one can clearly see the action of the axial symmetry .",
    "the new examples include circle - invariant adhm data corresponding to 1-parameter families with various kinds of dihedral and twisted - line symmetry , for all values of the topological charge .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a brief review of hyperbolic monopoles and their relation to euclidean instantons .",
    "section 3 reviews the braam - austin and manton - sutcliffe approaches to circle - symmetric adhm data . in section 4",
    "we give the first new results , which are explicit data and higgs fields for axial hyperbolic monopoles . in section 5",
    "we deform these to give some interesting new 1-parameter families , and we make some concluding remarks in section 6 .",
    "hyperbolic monopoles are solutions of the bogomolny equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the field strength of an @xmath2 gauge potential @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the covariant derivative of an adjoint higgs field @xmath5 .",
    "the background space is the unit ball model of hyperbolic space with curvature @xmath6 , which has metric @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this metric enters through the hodge star .",
    "monopoles must satisfy the boundary condition @xmath10 as @xmath11 , and the monopole charge @xmath12 is the degree of the map @xmath13 .    if @xmath14 , then the hyperbolic monopole is equivalent to a euclidean instanton with charge @xmath15 . to understand this equivalence",
    ", we first change to half - space coordinates : @xmath16 the metric becomes @xmath17 the metric on euclidean @xmath18 is @xmath19 if we let @xmath20 , then this becomes : @xmath21 which shows that euclidean @xmath22 is conformal to @xmath23 .",
    "the yang - mills equations are conformally invariant , so if we have an instanton symmetric under rotations in the @xmath24-direction we can ( after choosing a @xmath24-independent gauge ) dimensionally reduce along the @xmath24-direction to give a solution to .",
    "all our new monopole solutions are for the simplest case @xmath25 , for which the monopole and instanton charge are equal .",
    "the adhm construction @xcite , which we review in the next section , is an equivalence between instantons and quaternionic matrices satisfying algebraic constraints .",
    "this means we can find hyperbolic monopoles by looking for adhm data symmetric under a circle action .",
    "braam and austin @xcite analysed the circle - equivariant adhm construction , and showed that one can write such data as a set of matrix difference equations defined on a lattice .",
    "however , the braam - austin equations are still difficult to solve , presumably because they are based on a circle action that leads to the half - space model of hyperbolic space , so one can not impose platonic symmetries as in the euclidean case @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , manton and sutcliffe studied adhm data invariant under a different circle action which leads to the ball model , and were able to obtain many solutions with commuting platonic symmetries .",
    "below we review both the manton - sutcliffe and braam - austin approaches , as well as the spectral curves and rational maps one can associate to hyperbolic monopoles .",
    "the standard way of writing adhm data is in terms of quaternionic matrices .",
    "this uses an identification of @xmath18 with the quaternions @xmath26 , so that a point @xmath27 is written as @xmath28 .",
    "the adhm data for a charge @xmath29 instanton is given by a pair of quaternionic matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath30 is an @xmath29-component row vector , and @xmath31 is a symmetric @xmath32 matrix .",
    "these are combined into @xmath33 the adhm constraint is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a non - singular , real @xmath32 matrix .",
    "one then constructs the adhm operator @xmath36 to find the gauge field , one needs to find an @xmath37-component column vector @xmath38 with @xmath39 , that solves @xmath40 the gauge potential is then given by @xmath41 where the pure quaternion is regarded as an element of @xmath42 .",
    "now we consider circle - invariant adhm data .",
    "we can write conformal transformations of @xmath18 as quaternionic mbius transformations @xmath43 the circle action manton and sutcliffe use is @xmath44 the quotient of @xmath18 by this action is the unit ball with metric conformal to .",
    "the manton - sutcliffe constraints for an instanton to be invariant under this action are :    1 .",
    "@xmath31 is pure quaternion and symmetric , 2 .",
    "@xmath45 , 3 .",
    "@xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a pure quaternion , and @xmath30 is non - vanishing .",
    "adhm data satisfying these constraints will correspond to a hyperbolic monopole with @xmath25 .",
    "all of the new monopole solutions in this paper will be given in terms of adhm matrices satisfying the manton - sutcliffe constraints .",
    "to calculate the higgs field and energy density , suppose that the pure quaternion @xmath48 represents a point in the unit ball .",
    "let @xmath49 be a unit vector satisfying @xmath50 then the higgs field is @xmath51 and the energy density is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ball metric",
    ".    we will be interested in subgroups of the @xmath54 group of transformations of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a unit quaternion .",
    "these transformations commute with the circle action and will correspond , after dimensional reduction , to the group of rotations of @xmath57 fixing the origin . for an instanton to be symmetric under these transformations , we require @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a unit quaternion , and @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath56 runs over the elements of some symmetry subgroup of @xmath54 , the corresponding matrices @xmath61 will furnish a real @xmath29-dimensional representation of the symmetry group , while @xmath62 will give a 2-dimensional complex representation .",
    "the circle action used in the braam - austin construction is @xmath63 the construction works for any @xmath64 , and braam and austin showed that circle - equivariant adhm data breaks up into a set of difference equations defined on a lattice with @xmath65 sites . for simplicity , we restrict to @xmath65 odd . for a monopole of charge @xmath66 ,",
    "the data consists of complex @xmath67 matrices @xmath68 , and an @xmath66-row vector @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath70 are defined on the even lattice points @xmath71 , and the @xmath72 are defined on the odd lattice points @xmath73 .",
    "this data must satisfy the braam - austin equations @xmath74+\\gamma^\\dagger_{i-1}\\gamma_{i-1}-\\gamma_{i+1}\\gamma_{i+1}^\\dagger&=0\\\\\\label{ba5 } [ \\beta_{2p-1},\\beta_{2p-1}^\\dagger]+v^t \\overline{v}-\\gamma^\\dagger_{2p-2}\\gamma_{2p-2}&=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solutions to these difference equations correspond to a hyperbolic monopole in the half - space model .",
    "the braam - austin equations have a gauge freedom .",
    "suppose that @xmath75 is a sequence of unitary matrices for @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "then it is easy to see that the gauge transformations @xmath78 leave the braam - austin equations invariant .",
    "we also have the freedom to multiply @xmath69 by a unit norm complex number .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath79 .",
    "here we can use the gauge freedom to set @xmath80 and @xmath81 independent of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a complex number , and @xmath84 is a positive real number .",
    "@xmath85 can then be interpreted as coordinates for the 1-monopole in the upper half - plane .",
    "the @xmath25 case is also particularly simple . in this case",
    "the braam - austin data just consists of a single complex matrix @xmath83 and a complex row vector @xmath69 .",
    "if we identify these with standard form adhm data : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , then the braam - austin conditions become the usual adhm constraints .      just as for euclidean monopoles ,",
    "hyperbolic monopoles are known , via twistor correspondences , to be equivalent to spectral curves and rational maps between riemann spheres .",
    "the spectral curve is a riemann surface in the twistor space of oriented geodesics .",
    "a geodesic lies on the spectral curve if the scattering equation @xmath88 along the geodesic has a normalisable solution . in hyperbolic space",
    ", oriented geodesics are parametrised by their end - points on the boundary , and we denote the geodesic running from @xmath89 ( the antipodal point to @xmath90 ) to @xmath91 by the pair @xmath92 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the spectral curve of a charge @xmath66 monopole can be written as @xmath93 where the @xmath94 are complex constants .    for @xmath25 braam - austin data , which is simply a complex adhm matrix ,",
    "the spectral curve is given by the formula @xmath95 atiyah discovered a correspondence between hyperbolic @xmath66-monopoles and based rational maps of degree @xmath66 , which is also defined using the scattering equation .",
    "one considers geodesics running from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is defined to be the ratio of the decaying to the growing component of the solution to at the @xmath97 end .",
    "the basing condition is that @xmath99 , so the numerator of @xmath100 has degree less than @xmath66 , and the denominator has degree @xmath66 .",
    "this correspondence is not quite one - to - one , because multiplying @xmath98 by a constant phase corresponds to an identical monopole .",
    "we shall call these donaldson - type maps , since they are the hyperbolic analogue of the correspondence between euclidean monopoles and rational maps discovered by donaldson @xcite . for @xmath25 braam - austin data",
    ", we have a simple formula for the donaldson - type rational map @xcite : @xmath101    jarvis defined a rational map for euclidean monopoles more adapted to rotational symmetries than the donaldson map @xcite .",
    "in the hyperbolic case , if we have adhm data satisfying the manton - sutcliffe constraints for circle - invariance , as well as @xmath102 , a formula for a rational map which appears to be of jarvis type was given in @xcite : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a unit pure quaternion representing a point on the boundary .",
    "one obtains a rational map by writing both @xmath104 and its image @xmath105 in riemann sphere coordinates .",
    "for all the known examples of monopoles in the manton - sutcliffe formalism , the rational map has the same symmetry as the corresponding monopole .",
    "we shall see that this is also true of all the monopoles in this paper with @xmath102 .",
    "in this section we shall derive explicit expressions for the the fields and adhm data of axially symmetric @xmath25 monopoles . before discussing this ,",
    "we first review the construction of axial monopoles from the jnr ansatz .",
    "the jnr ansatz @xcite gives a charge @xmath29 instanton by specifying @xmath106 points @xmath107 in @xmath18 , together with @xmath106 positive real numbers @xmath108 .",
    "the gauge field is then @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 @xmath113 are the pauli matrices .",
    "if one places the poles @xmath114 on the fixed plane of some circle action on @xmath18 , then the corresponding instanton will necessarily be invariant under the circle action , and so correspond to a hyperbolic monopole . to obtain a monopole with the same symmetry as the configuration of poles , one must set the poles to have equal weight after a conformal transformation to the unit ball .",
    "if the poles lie on a circle then there is an action of the conformal group rotating the poles and acting on their weights , which means that the monopole can have extra symmetry not present in the configuration of poles . in particular , placing the poles at the vertices of a regular @xmath115-gon gives a symmetry enhancement from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "this gives a straightforward way to construct axially symmetric hyperbolic monopoles .",
    "the jnr construction readily gives the fields for hyperbolic monopoles and can be straightforwardly written in standard adhm matrix form using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the resulting adhm data will not be in a tractable form , and this approach does not give the representations ( as in ) compensating for the axial symmetry .",
    "these representations will be important later when we try to deform the axial monopoles to give families that are not obtainable from the jnr ansatz .",
    "our first result uses a correspondence between axial @xmath25 @xmath66-monopoles and @xmath118 1-monopoles to derive explicit axial monopole fields . to see this correspondence ,",
    "start with a @xmath118 1-monopole .",
    "this monopole is equivalent to a charge @xmath66 instanton invariant under rotations in the @xmath119-plane .",
    "however , 1-monopoles have an @xmath54-symmetry group of rotations about their centres , and in particular are symmetric under the @xmath120 subgroup of rotations in the @xmath121 plane .",
    "this @xmath120 symmetry lifts to the underlying instanton .",
    "the idea is now to swap the roles of these two symmetries , so we quotient by rotations in the @xmath121-plane and view rotations in the @xmath119-plane as a physical symmetry of the resulting monopole .",
    "the axially symmetric monopole one obtains after this swap will have charge @xmath66 and @xmath25 .",
    "this observation is useful because 1-monopoles are particularly simple .",
    "the bogomolny equation can be solved @xcite by a spherically - symmetric ansatz for all values of @xmath64 : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath64 is a half - integer , then @xmath126 and @xmath127 are rational functions of @xmath128 .    to obtain axial monopole fields , one first performs a coordinate transformation of the fields to half - space @xmath129 . to lift to the instanton",
    ", we interpret @xmath130 as radial and angular components respectively of @xmath3 in the @xmath119-plane .",
    "this instanton is symmetric under rotations in the @xmath121 plane , but to dimensionally reduce along this direction we must first put it in a gauge in which it is independent of these rotations .",
    "this process gives the higgs field magnitude of an axial @xmath65-monopole , written in ball model coordinates : @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the real usefulness of this ` swap ' of the roles of the circle symmetries is that it gives the axial monopole adhm data in a simple , natural form .",
    "carrying out the swap at the adhm level means that the braam - austin data for a 1-monopole written as a standard - form adhm matrix is precisely the same as the braam - austin data for the corresponding axial monopole .",
    "braam - austin data for a 1-monopole is trivial to write down , so the matrix one obtains this way is much simpler than the one coming from the jnr ansatz .",
    "furthermore one easily obtains the matrices compensating for the axial symmetry .",
    "below we give the results of this construction ; full details of the derivation can be found in the appendix .    the adhm data for the axial charge @xmath66 , @xmath25 monopole is best given inductively .",
    "the data for the 2-monopole is @xmath134 while the data for the 3-monopole is @xmath135 now suppose that @xmath136 is the adhm data for an axial @xmath66-monopole for @xmath137",
    ". then @xmath138 for axial symmetry , the matrices @xmath139 satisfy @xmath140 where @xmath141 and we define @xmath142 inductively .",
    "firstly , @xmath143 and , for @xmath144 , @xmath145 one can check that the matrices defined by satisfy the manton - sutcliffe constraints for circle symmetry .",
    "this is actually unsurprising .",
    "we would obtain the same instantons by placing the poles of the jnr ansatz at the roots of unity with equal weight in the @xmath146-plane .",
    "but then the poles will lie on the fixed - point set of the manton - sutcliffe circle action , which is the 2-sphere of unit - norm pure imaginary quaternions , so the instanton must also be invariant under this action as well .    in the next section we will be interested in subgroups of the symmetry group of the axial monopoles .",
    "axial monopoles are invariant under reflection in the @xmath147-plane @xmath148 since @xmath149 , and the compensating transformation is just the identity .",
    "are also symmetric under rotations by @xmath150 around the @xmath151-axis @xmath152 since @xmath153 where @xmath154    for reference , the axial @xmath66-monopole spectral curve is @xmath155 and the jarvis and donaldson - type rational maps are both @xmath156 .",
    "in this section we derive circle - invariant adhm data corresponding to families of dihedral and twisted - line symmetric hyperbolic monopoles .",
    "our data will satisfy the manton - sutcliffe constraints for circle invariance .",
    "to find symmetric adhm data , one can take representations of the symmetry qroups in @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and use them as constraints on adhm data via . for low charges , solving for adhm data constrained by the dihedral and twisted line symmmetries as well as the manton - sutcliffe conditions is tractable , and the solutions can be easily generalised to higher charges .",
    "this section contains the results of this approach for some interesting symmetry groups .",
    "the representations are key for this derivation , since we are using subrepresentations of these to constrain the data .",
    "the dihedral group @xmath159 is generated by rotations by @xmath160 around the @xmath161-axis , and the rotation @xmath162 given above .",
    "using the representations of these symmetries given in section [ axba ] leads to the following family of @xmath159-symmetric @xmath66-monopoles , for @xmath163 : @xmath164    for @xmath165 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the adhm data also satisfies the manton - sutcliffe constraints , and in particular that @xmath166 for all @xmath66 .",
    "these families correspond to the simplest type of @xmath66-monopole scattering .",
    "the sign of @xmath167 is chosen so that @xmath66 monopoles are close to the roots of unity for @xmath167 close to 1 .",
    "as @xmath167 decreases , the monopoles move radially towards the origin , losing their individual identities as @xmath167 gets closer to 0 .",
    "the configuration becomes axial at @xmath168 , and as @xmath167 becomes negative individual monopoles re - emerge in the same configuration as the incoming ones , but rotated by @xmath169 .",
    "the corresponding geodesic for euclidean monopoles is known only from its donaldson rational maps .",
    "if we multiply by @xmath170 on the left , then the data is purely complex , so we can think of it as braam - austin data defining a monopole in the half - plane model .",
    "we can calculate spectral curves and rational maps in this setting . for @xmath171 ,",
    "the spectral curve is @xmath172 which has manifest symmetry under @xmath173 .",
    "this curve is also symmetric under the map @xmath174 , so the monopole has dihedral symmetry in both the ball and half - space models . indeed ,",
    "if we make the identification @xmath175 , then is the same as the spectral curve of the @xmath176-symmetric 3-monopole family discussed in @xcite .",
    "this explains why the data for @xmath171 gives @xmath176-symmetric monopoles in both models : just as for the axial monopole , the jnr poles lie on the fixed - point sets of both circle actions .",
    "these @xmath159-symmetric @xmath66-monopoles appear to lie within the space of jnr data for all @xmath66 , although the required configuration of poles and weights is rather complicated . here",
    "these monopoles appear as simple , natural deformations of the axial monopole adhm data .",
    "the donaldson - type rational maps corresponding to are @xmath177 we can prove these maps straightforwardly using a formal expansion in powers of @xmath178 .",
    "the expansion of is @xmath179 while the expansion of the general rational map formula is @xmath180 where for the rest of this section @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the top row and bottom @xmath66 rows respectively of multiplied on the left by @xmath170 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath181 can be calculated explicitly .",
    "note that for @xmath182 , @xmath183 so we have , for @xmath184 , @xmath185 similarly , for @xmath186 , if @xmath66 is even , @xmath187 and if @xmath66 is odd , @xmath188 this shows that @xmath189 for @xmath190 , and @xmath191 .",
    "also @xmath192 and so @xmath193 so the coefficients of the two expansions are equal up to an overall phase of @xmath194 , proving the rational map formula . the rational map formula also makes the cyclic symmetry @xmath195 manifest .",
    "the generalisation of the spectral curve formula to arbitrary @xmath66 appears to be @xmath196 although we have not been able to prove this formula from the data .",
    "we can generate another interesting family by imposing @xmath198 symmetry together with the constraint @xmath102 . for @xmath163 ,",
    "the resulting adhm data is @xmath199 for @xmath200 .",
    "for @xmath167 close to 1 , the configuration consists of @xmath201 monopoles at the roots of unity , and one monopole at the origin .",
    "as @xmath167 decreases , the outer monopoles approach the origin from infinity , while a 1-monopole stays at the origin throughout .",
    "the configuration becomes axial for @xmath168 , and as @xmath167 becomes negative the same process happens in reverse , with the configuration rotated by an angle of @xmath202 .",

    "the generalisation of the spectral curve to @xmath197-symmetric @xmath66-monopoles appears to be , for @xmath213 , @xmath214 one can check that as @xmath215 this becomes a product of @xmath216 and stars for monopoles arranged in a regular polygon on the boundary .",

    "in contrast to the dihedral families , the outer monopoles lie on the symmetry axis of the central cluster , rather than perpendicular to it . the configuration becomes axial as @xmath167 passes through zero , and then as @xmath167 decreases the process happens in reverse , but rotated by @xmath202 around the @xmath161-axis .",

    "we again substitute @xmath222 in the data to put the rational maps into a simpler form .",
    "for @xmath171 , the rational map is @xmath236 which has the @xmath227 symmetry @xmath237 . for @xmath238 ,",
    "the rational map is @xmath239 with the @xmath232 symmetry @xmath240 .",
    "the third and fourth columns of figure 1 show energy density isosurfaces of twisted - line symmetric monopoles of charges 4 and 5 respectively , for different values of @xmath167 between 1 and 0 decreasing down the column .    for the @xmath238 family , one can check that if @xmath241 the rational map is equivalent to the degree 4 cubically symmetric rational map given in @xcite , combined with a rotation to bring the cube into the correct orientation .",
    "note that for @xmath242 , all members of these twisted - line symmetric families ( apart from the axial monopoles ) lie outside the space of jnr - type monopoles , because it is impossible to arrange @xmath243 distinct points on the 2-sphere with @xmath226-symmetry .",
    "using an equivalence between @xmath25 axial @xmath66-monopoles and @xmath118 1-monopoles , we have given an explicit formula for the higgs field magnitude of axial @xmath25 monopoles , as well as their circle - invariant adhm data .",
    "we have deformed the axial monopole data to give 1-parameter families with various kinds of dihedral and twisted - line symmetry , for all values of the topological charge .",
    "the dihedral families presented here should extend to @xmath197-symmetric @xmath66-monopole configurations with @xmath170 monopoles at the origin for @xmath244 , although we have not been able to find the explicit adhm data for these with our methods .",
    "another approach would be to see if there exist jnr - type monopoles with the right poles and weights to give the conjectured spectral curves . for @xmath170 and @xmath204 both large",
    ", this should give a hyperbolic prototype of manton s multi - shell magnetic bags @xcite , although these bags would be degenerate , in the sense that the volume of their interiors would be zero .",
    "the natural @xmath245 metric on the moduli space of hyperbolic monopoles diverges , so the usual geodesic approximation to monopole scattering can not be applied in this case .",
    "however , hyperbolic monopoles define an abelian connection on the boundary 2-sphere , and this connection can be used to define a metric on the monopole moduli space . an integral expression for this metric on the space of jnr - type monopoles",
    "was given in @xcite .",
    "all the 1-parameter families in this paper are geodesics with respect to this metric , since they are obtained as fixed - point sets of subgroups of the symmetry group of hyperbolic space . in this paper",
    "we gave the data for a family of @xmath203-symmetric 3-monopoles .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the metric on this space with the metric on the space of @xmath203-symmetric 2-monopoles , since in the euclidean case these are known to be the same .",
    "in this appendix we derive the monopole adhm data and the representations by interchanging the roles of the circle symmetries , as described in section [ swap ] . to implement this ` swap ' at the adhm level",
    ", one has to write the adhm construction in the abstract , coordinate - free way it was originally introduced , and later used by braam and austin @xcite . in this formulation , adhm data defining an instanton of charge @xmath29 is a linear map @xmath246 depending linearly on @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is an @xmath29-dimensional complex vector space with an antilinear map @xmath249 satisfying @xmath250 , and @xmath251 is a @xmath252-dimensional complex vector space with another antilinear map @xmath253 satisfying @xmath254 . if we identify @xmath255 with @xmath256 in the standard way , @xmath257 , then we define a map @xmath258 on @xmath255 to be right multiplication by @xmath170 . to define an instanton , @xmath3",
    "must then satisfy :    1 .",
    "@xmath259 , 2 .",
    "@xmath260 is injective and @xmath261 is an isotropic subspace of @xmath251 for all @xmath262 .",
    "this means that @xmath263 for all @xmath264 .",
    "there is a prescription for turning this into the standard quaternionic matrix form of adhm data ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first , we can write @xmath248 as @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is the subspace of @xmath248 left fixed by @xmath249 . we can also identify @xmath251 with an @xmath37-dimensional right quaternionic vector space @xmath267 , with multiplication by @xmath170 given by @xmath253 .",
    "condition 1 above means that we can consider @xmath3 to be a quaternionic linear map @xmath268 . to write out the corresponding matrix",
    ", we first choose a basis for the vector space @xmath266 ( a so - called ` real basis ' ) , and a basis for @xmath267 which is unitary with the respect to the standard quaternion inner product .",
    "now with respect to these bases , define a matrix @xmath269 whose columns are the images under @xmath3 of @xmath270 basis vectors of @xmath266 , so @xmath269 is an @xmath271 quaternionic matrix .",
    "similarly define a matrix @xmath272 whose columns are the images under @xmath3 of @xmath273 basis vectors of @xmath266 .",
    "then @xmath3 is described by a quaternionic matrix function of the coordinates @xmath274 on @xmath256 : @xmath275 condition 2 above is equivalent to requiring that @xmath276 be a real non - singular matrix for all @xmath277 .",
    "we can obtain standard form adhm data by setting @xmath278 and finding @xmath279 and @xmath280 such that @xmath281 then the standard quaternionic matrix defining an instanton is @xmath282 .",
    "we ll illustrate the ` swap ' at the adhm level by writing @xmath283 braam - austin data in standard quaternionic matrix form .",
    "following @xcite , if the hyperbolic monopole has charge @xmath66 then in the @xmath283 case @xmath248 has complex dimension @xmath284 and @xmath251 has complex dimension @xmath285 . under the circle action , @xmath248 breaks up into subspaces @xmath286 where each @xmath287 has dimension @xmath66 , while @xmath251 breaks up into subspaces @xmath288 , where @xmath289 are @xmath243-dimensional and @xmath290 are @xmath291-dimensional .",
    "the subscripts here refer to the weights of the circle action on these spaces .",
    "we can write @xmath292 , so the @xmath293 are matrix components of the map @xmath3 .",
    "one can choose bases for @xmath248 and @xmath251 such that : @xmath294 @xmath295 where @xmath68 are complex @xmath296 matrices and @xmath69 is a complex @xmath56-row vector .",
    "these matrices will correspond to the quaternionic matrices @xmath297 described above , after we make our quaternionic identifications .",
    "first we need to identify a real basis for @xmath248 .",
    "suppose that @xmath298 above are defined with respect to bases @xmath299 for each @xmath300 .",
    "these bases are chosen in such a way that the real structure @xmath301 is just conjugation .",
    "with respect to this real structure , a real basis for @xmath302 is @xmath303 , while @xmath304 is already a real basis for @xmath305 .",
    "the prescription above says that we need to find the images of these vectors in @xmath251 and then use the antilinear map on @xmath251 to identify these images with quaternionic row vectors .",
    "the basis of @xmath251 used to define @xmath306 above is chosen such that @xmath253 acts on @xmath307 by @xmath308 .",
    "this means we should identify @xmath309 with the quaternionic vector @xmath310 .",
    "the map @xmath253 now corresponds to multiplication by @xmath170 on the right . using the matrices @xmath306 to determine the images of the real basis vectors",
    "gives : @xmath311 multiplying on the left by @xmath312 and on the right by @xmath313 and setting @xmath278 gives adhm data in standard form : @xmath314 imposing the usual adhm constraint that @xmath315 be a real non - singular matrix gives exactly the braam - austin equations for the @xmath283 system .",
    "now we specialise to the case of a charge 1 @xmath283 monopole .",
    "as described in section [ baconstr ] , we can choose our gauge such that @xmath316 @xmath317 @xmath318 are constant for all @xmath82 .",
    "we can then interpret @xmath85 as centre of mass coordinates for the 1-monopole in the half - space model .",
    "we choose our monopole to sit at @xmath319 , and we also choose @xmath320 . then gives us adhm data in standard form : @xmath321 note that the resulting adhm matrix only has non - zero @xmath322-parts , which shows that this data is invariant under rotations in the @xmath121 plane .",
    "this example illustrates how to interpret the ` swap ' at the level of adhm data .",
    "we arranged the braam - austin data for a 1-monopole of mass 3/2 , which is a set of matrices defined on a lattice with 3 sites , into a single @xmath323 matrix with pure @xmath322 entries .",
    "the braam - austin data for a @xmath25 monopole just consists of a single complex matrix satisfying the adhm constraints , which , up to an overall factor of @xmath170 , is what we obtained in .",
    "this whole construction generalises straightforwardly to give the data .",
    "the construction also gives the matrices compensating for axial symmetry .",
    "one can see from that the rotation @xmath324 acts on the braam - austin data as : @xmath325 we can compensate for this by the gauge transformation @xmath326 we need to understand how to interpret gauge transformations in terms of compensating matrices for standard adhm data .",
    "gauge transformations act on both @xmath251 and @xmath248 ; in terms of the bases chosen above , the gauge transformation acts on @xmath251 by : @xmath327 and on @xmath248 by : @xmath328 using our quaternionic identifications above , becomes : @xmath329 while becomes : @xmath330 and one can check that these matrices will compensate for the transformations applied to the data . using our transformations and gives the standard compensating matrices for the axial symmetry : @xmath331 and this construction generalises straightforwardly to give the compensating matrices .",
