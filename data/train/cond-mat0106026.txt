    "among the challenges presented by the high - temperature superconductors , one of the most persistent concerns the anomalous properties of the _ normal _ state of these materials .",
    "in particular , the suppression of single - particle spectral weight around the fermi energy  @xcite for temperatures above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 of the underdoped cuprates indicates that the electronic behavior of these materials deviates substantially from that of conventional superconductors .",
    "there have been several theoretical scenarios proposed to explain this so - called pseudogap behavior  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we shall be concerned with a particular one of these , viz .",
    ", the phase - fluctuation scenario  @xcite . according to this scenario ,",
    "superconducting correlations in the form of cooper pairing are presumed to exist ( and to be responsible for the loss of single - particle spectral weight ) for temperatures @xmath1 below the pseudogap onset temperature @xmath2 . however , in the intermediate temperature range ( i.e.  @xmath3 ) the long - range spatial and temporal coherence in the phase of cooper - pair wave functions ( occurring for @xmath4 ) is presumed to present only up to intermediate length scales , having been disrupted on longer length scales by the presence and motion of vortex excitations .",
    "in other words , although long - range phase coherence is absent in it , the pseudogap regime is quantitatively distinguished from the conventional non - superconducting state by the presence of substantial , residual , local d - wave pairing correlations .",
    "several recent experimental investigations support the notion of the phase - fluctuation scenario as the origin of pseudogap phenomenology , including refs .",
    "further steps towards an understanding the nature of the pseudogap regime would be furnished by experimental probes that are targeted towards the question of the existence of the putative local superconducting correlations  @xcite .",
    "such probes would have the potential to discriminate between scenarios based on pairing correlations and those in which the pseudogap is due to some other mode of electronic ordering  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to identify one such probe : scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements of the single - particle spectral function near extended impurities in the pseudogap regime  @xcite .    before explaining the nature of this probe ,",
    "let us pause to recall one of its essential ingredients .",
    "it is has long been recognized  @xcite that the scattering of quasiparticles between states corresponding to differing signs of the d - wave pair - potential leads to the existence of low - energy states  @xcite . such scattering , and hence low - energy state - formation , occurs , e.g. , at suitably oriented surfaces in the cuprates , leading to the observed zero - bias anomaly in the tunneling conductance  @xcite . in the setting of impurity ( rather than boundary ) scattering in d - wave superconductors , low - energy states , which in this case are localized near the impurities ,",
    "have been observed in sts experiments  @xcite , and have been discussed theoretically for the case of point - like  @xcite and extended  @xcite impurities .",
    "we remind the reader that these states co - exist with the continuum of low - energy quasiparticle states associated with the nodes at which the d - wave pair - potential vanishes . distinguishing between impurity states and nodal states",
    "is straightforward because the former give a peaked contribution to the spectral function whereas the contribution from the latter vanishes linearly at zero energy .",
    "( a clear example of this is furnished by the data reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    returning to our main task , viz . , probing the pseudogap regime for pairing correlations , we now state the central idea on which the present paper is based .",
    "let us suppose that the pseudogap state is indeed distinguished by the presence of local ( but not long range ) d - wave pairing correlations .",
    "the lack of long - range phase coherence in such a state complicates the experimental observation of the more conventional signatures of superconducting correlations ( such as the meissner effect ) .",
    "however , the low - energy quasiparticle states occurring near extended impurities are _",
    "localized _ in space , i.e. , their existence only relies on the presence of local d - wave pairing correlations . in consequence",
    ", these states should be only weakly affected by the destruction of long - range superconducting order that occurs at @xmath0 , and hence should survive  the transition into the pseudogap state .",
    "thus , if sts experiments were to reveal a sharp feature in the single - particle spectral function at low voltage bias , this would be evidence for the presence of local d - wave pairing correlations . and",
    "if such experiments were able to characterize the temperature- and doping - dependence of the width of this spectral feature , this would provide a characterization of the nature of these finite - range spatial and temporal correlations .",
    "of course , the interpretation of any experiment conducted at nonzero temperature would have to contend with broadening ( arising , e.g. , from thermal fluctuations of the sample ) . in order to minimize the consequent smearing of the spectral function ,",
    "which has the potential to obscure the very feature being sought , it would be preferable to examine cuprate systems having low values of @xmath0 ( e.g.  heavily underdoped systems ) .",
    "why are we focusing on the case of ( non - magnetic ) _ extended _ impurities as a probe of the pseudogap regime ?",
    "the main reason underlying this choice is as follows . in the setting of extended impurities ( as well as boundaries ) in the superconducting state",
    ", it has been shown that the existence of low - energy quasiparticle states is a direct consequence of the d - wave nature ( or , more precisely , the sign - changing nature ) of the pair - potential  @xcite . extending this reasoning to the case of extended impurities in the pseudogap regime , there",
    "the existence of low - energy states strongly depends on the presence of superconducting correlations of d - wave type .",
    "we note that kruis et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the density of states near a _ point - like _ impurity in the context of a simple phenomenological picture of the pseudogap regime . in this picture , the physics of the pseudogap regime is incorporated through the hypothesis that , in the absence of the impurity , the single - particle density of states vanishes linearly at the fermi energy . at present ,",
    "the extent to which an approach based on this picture can yield information about pairing correlations in the pseudogap regime is not clear .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we provide a framework for discussing the influence of local d - wave pairing correlations on quasiparticle states near extended impurities  @xcite , focusing on the single - particle spectral function .",

    "[ sec : semiclassical ] we develop a semiclassical scheme for computing this density of states at fixed pair - potential in which we treat the long - wavelength pair - potential phase variations via perturbation theory .",
    "this scheme allows us to focus on the contribution to the density of states at low energies , which involves states arising from changes in sign ( as the momentum is varied ) of the local pair - potential . at this point",
    "we will have obtained an expression for the spectral function which consists of a sum of terms each associated with one classical scattering trajectory that passes through the vicinity of the impurity potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gauss ] we perform the average over the configurations of the fluctuating pair - potential arrived at via locally randomizations of the phase , under the assumption that the distribution of phase - field configurations is gaussian .",
    "we make an approximation to the resulting expression for the spectral function that is valid for the case of phase correlations persisting beyond the cooper - pair size , finally arriving at an expression for the spectral function near an extended impurity that consists of a gaussian peak the linewidth of which is proportional to the typical gradient of the phase of the pair - potential . in this section",
    "we also compute the linewidth of the spectral function in the pseudogap regime , doing so by assuming that the phase fluctuations are governed by the bkt theory of the two - dimensional @xmath5-model . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concluding ] we make a numerical estimate of the linewidth by invoking the results of recent high - frequency conductivity data  @xcite , and provide some concluding remarks .",
    "in the present section we formulate the task of obtaining the single - particle spectral function in settings of systems of fermions interacting via some fermion - fermion coupling and also interacting with an external single - fermion potential ( which could , e.g. , represent an impurity potential ) . as our aim is to address the phase - fluctuation picture of the pseudogap regime of the cuprates , we envision following the standard field - theoretic route ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "experiments , thermal broadening would complicate the task of accessing the intrinsic linewidth ( i.e.  the linewidth due to phase fluctuations ) ; recall that @xmath141 is equivalent to @xmath142 . thus , as emphasized in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , one should consider performing experiments on materials having a lower @xmath0 , so that the pseudogap regime can be explored at temperatures at which thermal broadening is less significant .",
    "these considerations indicate that it is at least conceivable that sts experiments near extended scatterers could provide a sharp test of the phase fluctuation scenario for the pseudogap regime .",

    "the caveat with regard to our focusing on scatterers that create trajectories having at most one sign change in the pair - potential is meant to eliminate from consideration various very low - energy states associated with trajectories involving an even number of multiple sign - changes of the pair - potential . in particular , we have in mind the following scenario : imagine a system consisting of two extended impurities .",
