    "in preceding papers @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) , using a feynmann - schwinger type of path integral representation and an appropriate ansatz for the wilson loop correlator , we have obtained a bethe - salpeter and a dyson - schwinger equation for certain `` second order '' quark - antiquark and single quark green functions .    to solve the @xmath5 bound state problem one should in principle solve the ds equation and use the resulting quark propagator in the bs equation . in practice",
    "even an approximate treatment of such problem in its full four - dimensional form seems to be extremely hard and for we have to resort to the use of free propagator and of a three - dimensional reduction of the bs equation ( instantaneous approximation ) .",
    "such reduction takes the form of the eigenvalue equation for an effective squared mass operator @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the relativistic free energies of the quarks and @xmath8 an interaction related to the bs kernel .    in more conventional terms one can also consider a center of mass hamiltonian @xmath9 , where at the lowest order @xmath10 differs from @xmath8 only for kinematic factors",
    "this last form can be more directly compared with usual relativistic and non relativistic potential models and @xmath10 turns out to have various significant limit expressions . in the static limit @xmath10",
    "takes the cornell form @xmath11 in the heavy masses limit , by an @xmath12 expansion ( and an appropriate foldy - wouthuysen transformation ) it reproduces the semi relativistic potential discussed in @xcite and @xcite . if the spin dependent terms are neglected , it becomes identical ( apart from a question of ordering ) to the potential corresponding to the relativistic flux tube model @xcite , up to the first order in the coupling constant @xmath13 and the string tension @xmath14 .",
    "in @xcite we have solved numerically the eigenvalue equation for @xmath3 , as we shall explain later , neglecting the spin - orbit terms but including the hyperfine separation .",
    "we have succeeded to reproduce fairly well the entire heavy - heavy , light - light and light - heavy quarkonium spectrum and regge trajectories when the actual calculations were feasible .",
    "the only real exception was the case of the ground light pseudoscalar mesons , for which the three - dimensional reduction of the bs equation does not seem to be appropriate , due to the chiral symmetry breaking problem .    concerning the choice of the constants ,",
    "the light quark masses were fixed on typical current values , @xmath15 and only the heavy quark masses , the strong coupling constant and the string tension were used as fitting parameters .",
    "good agreement with the data was found for @xmath16 .    in spite of",
    "the success attained it turns out , however , that the quantity @xmath17 is not negligible bringing e.g. to corrections ranging between few tens and 150 mev in the @xmath18 case .",
    "for this reason in this paper we have repeated the calculations for the more complex operator @xmath4 .",
    "a good agreement is again obtained at the price of a small rearrangement of the parameters and of using a running coupling constant given by the usual perturbative expression @xmath19 cut at a maximum value @xmath20 .",
    "we have taken @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where the last two values have been chosen in order to reproduce the correct @xmath25 separation and the regge trajectory slope .",
    "we have also chosen @xmath26 and @xmath27 in order to reproduce exactly the masses of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; on the contrary we have left unchanged the masses of the light quarks .    in the following we revue the bs and the ds equations in sect .",
    "ii and the three - dimensional reduction in sect . iii . in sect .",
    "iv we report and discuss the results obtained in @xcite for @xmath3 and the new results for @xmath4 .",
    "the gauge invariant `` second order '' green functions considered in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite were defined as @xmath30 @xmath31 where the tilde and @xmath32 denote the transposition and the trace , respectively , over the color indices alone ; @xmath8 is a path - ordered gauge string joining @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( schwinger string ) , @xmath35 ; while @xmath36 stands for the `` second order '' quark propagator in a external gauge field @xmath37 , defined by the iterated dirac equation @xmath38 with @xmath39 $ ] ; finally the angle brackets in ( [ eq : qqeqh ] ) and ( [ eq : qeqh ] ) denote average on the gauge variables alone ( weighted in principle with the determinant @xmath40 resulting from the explicit integration of the fermionic fields ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath41 and @xmath42 are simply related to their ordinary `` first order '' counterparts and can be equivalently used for the determination of the bound state .",
    "the advantage they offer is that of admitting path integral representations in terms of quark world lines which derive from the similar feynmann - schwinger representation for @xmath36 .",
    "such representations depend on the gauge field only trough wilson correlators @xmath43 = { 1\\over 3 }        \\langle { \\rm tr } { \\rm p } \\exp \\ { i g   \\oint_\\gamma dx^{\\mu }        a_{\\mu } \\ }   \\rangle   \\ , , $ ] associated to loops @xmath44 made by the quark and antiquark world lines closed by `` schwinger strings '' .    in principle , as a consequence , the above correlators should determine the whole dynamics . unfortunately , due to confinement and the consequent failure of a purely perturbative approach , a consistent analytic evaluation of @xmath45 from the lagrangian alone is not possible today and one has to rely on models based on incomplete theoretical arguments and lattice simulation information .",
    "the most naive , but at the same time less arbitrary assumption , consists in writing @xmath46 as the sum of its perturbative expression and an area term ( modified area law ( mal ) model ) @xmath47 where the first quantity is supposed to give correctly the short range limit , the second the long range one .",
    "notice in principle any more sophisticated model could be used , at the condition it preserves certain general properties of functional derivability of the exact expression . in practice",
    "not even ( [ eq : wl ] ) can be treated exactly .",
    "actually one has to replace the minimal surface @xmath48 by its `` equal time straight line approximation '' , defined as the surface spanned by straight lines joining equal time opposite points of the loop @xmath44 in the @xmath5 center of mass frame .",
    "the path integral representations obtained in such a way could be used directly for numerical calculations or for analytic developments . in the last context it is convenient to consider a second type of second order functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 obtained from @xmath51 and @xmath42 by omitting in their path integral representation the contributions to @xmath52 coming from gluon lines or straight lines involving points of the schwinger strings . in the limit of vanishing @xmath53 or @xmath54",
    "such new quantities coincide with the original ones and are completely equivalent to them for what concerns the determination of bound states , effective masses , quark condensates , etc .    by an appropriate recurrence method ,",
    "an inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation and a dyson - schwinger equation can be derived for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . in the momentum space ,",
    "the corresponding homogeneous bs - equation can be written ( in a @xmath55 matrix representation ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes an appropriate wave function and the center of mass frame has to be understood ; i.e. @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the bound state mass .",
    "similarly , in terms of the irreducible self - energy defined by @xmath60 the ds - equation can be written also @xmath61 notice that in principle ( [ eq : bshoma ] ) and ( [ eq : sdeq ] ) are exact equations .",
    "however the kernels @xmath62 are generated in the form of an expansion in @xmath13 and @xmath14 . at the lowest order in both such constants",

    "to obtain from ( [ eq : bshoma ] ) a three - dimensional equation we can perform on such equation the so called instantaneous approximation .",
    "this consists in replacing in ( [ eq : bshoma ] ) @xmath65 with the free quark propagator @xmath66 and the kernel @xmath67 with @xmath68 obtained from @xmath67 setting @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "in ref . @xcite we have evaluated the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath3 for the potential @xmath10 discussed above omitting the spin - orbit terms and including only the hyperfine splitting .",
    "the numerical procedure we have followed is very simple .",
    "it consists in solving first the eigenvalue equation for the static potential ( [ eq : static ] ) by the rayleigh - ritz method @xcite using the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator basis diagonalizing a @xmath91 matrix .",
    "then we have evaluated the quantities @xmath92 for the eigenfunctions @xmath93 obtained in the first step , choosing the scale parameter occurring in the basis in order to make minimum the ground state mass @xmath94 .",
    "notice that the determination of @xmath95 for the exact @xmath10 is not trivial , since in general one should evaluate five - dimensional integrals of a highly singular functions .",
    "for such reason we have used two different expansions for high and low transversal momentum ( angular momentum ) , that allows to reduce to a three - dimensional integrals and treated the singularity with the method suggested in @xcite .",
    "the procedure we have followed for the determination of the eigenvalues of @xmath4 is essentially the same .",
    "again we solve first the eigenvalue equation for @xmath3 with the static potential , and then we evaluate the quantities @xmath96 . in this case the hyperfine splitting is determined by the equation @xmath97 which is more complicated than the corresponding equation in the case of @xmath3 @xcite .    both the new results based on @xmath4 ( crosses in figs.[fig1]-[fig3 ] and dashed lines in fig.[fig4 ] ) and the old ones based on @xmath3 ( circlets in figs.[fig1]-[fig3 ] and dotted lines in fig.[fig4 ] ) are reported in figures for the parameters discussed in the introduction . for the @xmath98 cases masses represent the center of mass of the multiplets . in both cases",
    "the agreement with the data is on the whole good , not only for bottonium and charmonium ( as in ordinary potential models ) , but also the light - light and light - heavy systems .",
    "notice that the quadratic formulation seems to give a better low angular momentum light - light spectrum , while perhaps the linear formulation gives better regge trajectories .",
    "the regge trajectories in the quadratic case can be improved rising the value of @xmath14 at the price , however , of making more difficult the fitting of the light - heavy states ( perhaps the mal model is too naive ) .",
    "as we mentioned the only serious disagreement remains that of the light pseudoscalar mesons .",
