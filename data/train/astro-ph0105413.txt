    "five years ago , the combination of deep seated belief in inflation , implying @xmath10 , and stellar age estimates near 15 gyr seemed to require @xmath11 . measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in clusters notwithstanding , bartlett , blanchard , silk , and turner wrote a provocative paper entitled , `` the case for a hubble constant of 30 km / s / mpc . '' persuaded by the power of theoretical reasoning , joe silk bet brian schmidt and me a case of scotch that @xmath14 . while joe has not yet paid up , in the past 5 years he has moved closer to the source of scotch while the hubble constant has moved to 60 and beyond .",
    "the new element is that supernovae have made the connection between @xmath15 and the cosmic age more flexible because of plausible evidence for cosmic acceleration .    a danish - english team ( norgaard - neilsen et al .",
    "1989 ) initiated a program to find supernovae in clusters of galaxies at redshifts of 0.3 - 0.5 , with the idea that they could distinguish the effects of cosmic deceleration , as expected in an @xmath0 = 1 universe by measuring the peak apparent magnitudes of supernova light curves .",
    "the observational problem was to find these faint ( m@xmath1621 - 22 ) and distant supernovae near the peak of their light curves .",
    "but small detectors kept this pioneering effort from yielding significant results .",
    "the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) based at lawrence berkeley lab forged ahead with further attempts to find distant supernovae by extending the methods of the danes to bigger , faster telescopes . after abandoning attempts to instrument the aat prime focus for this purpose",
    ", they used the standard large format detectors at the kitt peak national observatory starting in 1992 ( perlmutter 1995 ) . by 1997",
    ", they had a preliminary result ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ) based on observations of seven supernovae discovered in 1994 and 1995 . by comparing their supernovae with the sample at low redshift , they concluded that the evidence favored a universe with high matter density @xmath17 .",
    "they argued that the supernova data at that point placed the strongest constraint on the possible value of the cosmological constant , with their best estimate being @xmath18 .    since 1995 , there have been two groups pursuing evidence on cosmic deceleration using the hubble diagram for supernovae .",
    "our high - z supernova search team , steered by brian schmidt , and encompassing workers on four continents and one mid - pacific island , found our first supernova in 1995 ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) . from three additional supernovae studied with @xmath19 the high - z team found a low value of @xmath0 , showing that ordinary matter could not close the universe ( garnavich et al .",
    "our first results on @xmath20 were reported at the dark matter conference in february of 1998 by filippenko and riess ( 1998 ) and published in the astronomical journal in september 1998 ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the same period ,",
    "the scp revised their analysis of earlier data ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ) and then independently reported evidence on @xmath20 in the astrophysical journal in june 1999 ( perlmutter et al .",
    "even this first round of supernova observations , which emphasized a sample near z@xmath160.5 , provided a good constraint on the _ difference _",
    "@xmath0-@xmath20 which , since @xmath0 measures deceleration , and @xmath20 measures acceleration , translates into a surprisingly tight constraint on @xmath5 .",
    "the present samples of snia published , in hand , and being reduced by the two teams provide a statistically robust measurement that @xmath4 .",
    "the important questions now are whether the supernovae at large redshift are really the same as the supernovae nearby and whether exotic forms of grey dust might obscure both the supernovae and our understanding of cosmology ( aguirre , 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the observational approach to answer these questions is to use spectra to examine the question of homogeneity ( coil et al .",
    "2001 ) and multicolor observations over a wide range of wavelengths ( as might be done with a superb 8-m infrared telescope at the world s best site ) to constrain the properties of intergalactic dust ( riess et al .",
    "so far , although the distant supernovae could have failed these tests , they seem indistinguishable from the snia nearby .",
    "a more ambitious test for the cosmological origin of the observed effect is to extend the data set to higher redshift .",
    "while dimming due to evolution or dust would most naturally lead to larger effects at higher redshift , cosmological effects could have the opposite sign due to cosmic deceleration at early epochs ( z @xmath16 1.5 ) , followed by a transition to acceleration in the more recent past .",
    "looking at real data helps develop an understanding of the observational issues in discovering and measuring light curves for high redshift supernovae .",
    "here we illustrate the appearance of a z=0.81 supernova , sn 1999fj , as observed in a series of images from october through december 1999 .",
    "large format detectors on telescopes at good seeing sites are the chief requirement for efficient surveys to find type ia supernovae at @xmath21 .",
    "follow - up observations with 8-m class telescopes enable us to construct light curves that can be used to place each snia firmly on the hubble diagram .",
    "one of the key developments that makes snia so useful as standard candles is the discovery by mark phillips ( phillips 1993 ) that the luminosity of a snia is related to its rate of decline after maximum light .",
    "this approach , refined by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and by riess , press & kirshner ( 1996 ) allows the distance of a well - observed snia with two color data to be determined to better than 10% .",
    "the light curves for high redshift supernovae are obtained in filters which can be transformed back to rest frame b and v with good precision .",
    "time dilation , a signature of cosmic expansion , is a powerful effect for supernovae near z@xmath22 , transforming 40 days in the observer s frame to 20 days in the supernova s own rest frame ( leibundgut et al .",
    "photometric calibration and scrupulous subtraction of galaxy light are serious problems for this work which become more difficult at high redshift .",
    "nevertheless , images like those in figure 1 can be used to construct light curves as shown in figure 2 .",
    "what is the observational evidence on @xmath8 ?",
    "many techniques have been developed for measuring extragalactic distances and the ones we love the best are snia ( jha et al .",
    "1999 ) and the surface brightness fluctuation method , reviewed recently by blakeslee , ajhar , & tonry ( 1999 ) .",
    "ajhar et al .",
    "2001 demonstrate that these methods are internally consistent : as figure 3 shows , distances measured by snia and by sbf to the same galaxies are consistent within the quoted errors .",
    "this suggests that both methods are in good shape .",
    "but what is @xmath8 , so diligently sought through the decades ?",
    "this depends entirely on the sample of cepheids used and the distances assigned to those cepheids by expert workers in that field . if you use the distances to galaxies with cepheids as determined by various papers by the key project ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 , freedman et al .",
    "2001 , gibson & stetson 2001 ) to define the absolute magnitude of snia and sbf , you get @xmath23 , 75 , and 77 for both snia and sbf . if you use the distances to the same galaxies using the same cepheid observations as reduced by saha et al ( 1997 ) and most recently compiled by parodi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , you get @xmath24 according to the methodology used by the high - z team , or @xmath25 according to parodi et al .",
    "similarly , the distances to the sbf calibrating galaxies depend entirely on the cepheid distances .",
    "the hubble constant is * not * determined by snia or by sbf alone : these methods give excellent relative distances to galaxies and tie the cosmic expansion firmly to the local calibrators , but the calibration by cepheids is now the largest uncertainty in measuring the local value of the hubble constant . for the rest of this paper",
    ", we will either adopt @xmath26 as a best - guess value , or else a probability distribution which consists of two gaussians of fractional width 0.1 , centered on @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with a @xmath28 , @xmath29 weighting .",
    "it ai nt perfect , but it s our gut feeling of where @xmath8 really lies .",
    "the key evidence on a value for @xmath5 comes from figure 4 .",
    "all the supernova and sbf distances are consistent at low redshift , and the supernova data indicate that a model with @xmath20=0 does not fit at z@xmath16 0.5 .",
    "this is the case for an accelerating universe , whether urged on by a cosmological constant or by something which varies with time .",
    "the best fit model has @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "none of the observers is satisfied with the current state of the statistical errors ( about twice as large for each scp supernova as for the high - z data ) or with current limits on possible systematic effects that might make distant supernovae dimmer .",
    "figure 4 shows that a systematic effect that just grows as the redshift is not a good fit to the data , but the most telling way to separate a systematic effect that is proportional to redshift or time is to look at redshifts above 1 . for a @xmath32-dominated cosmology , there is a transition , somewhere around @xmath33 , from acceleration here and now to deceleration in the distant past when the matter density , which scales as @xmath34 would have been more important .",
    "the high - z team is working hard to test these ideas .",
    "our fall 1999 data , which are being slowly beaten into photometric perfection , emphasize z@xmath161 objects which will provide strong evidence to distinguish cosmology from systematics .",
    "preliminary reductions are shown here .",
    "our fall 2000 program emphasized careful ubvri photometry in the supernova rest frame to discern the effects of not - quite - gray dust .",
    "the final reduction of those data requires observations of the galaxy _ without _ the supernova , obtained a year after the discovery , and will be forthcoming when these templates are in hand ( jha 2001 ) .",
    "we can employ the tools of likelihood analysis to construct contours in the @xmath35@xmath20 plane , as illustrated in figure 5 . of special note",
    "is the effectiveness of just a handful of z @xmath36 0.9 supernovae in contracting the contours of this plot ( as imagined by goobar and perlmutter 1995 ) .",
    "a concise way to express the best constraint on @xmath35 and @xmath20 is @xmath37 .",
    "interestingly , contours of constant age are very nearly parallel to the long axis of the error ellipse in figure 5 .",
    "this means that the competition between deceleration due to @xmath35 and acceleration due to @xmath20 is well captured by the measurement of luminosity distances , and the value of @xmath5 is well constrained even though the individual values of @xmath35 and @xmath20 are not .",
    "marginalizing the probabilities of figure 5 onto the @xmath5 axis yields a probability distribution for @xmath5 as shown in figure 6 .",
    "we find @xmath38 .",
    "the absolute value of the cosmic age depends on @xmath8 , which , given the excellent agreement of the sbf and snia distances , inherits almost all its errors from the cepheid zero point .",
    "precise distance estimators measured over the range from z@xmath16 0 to z@xmath161 provide powerful constraints on the dimensionless product @xmath38 . despite an ongoing struggle between deceleration and acceleration , the fortuitous result is that the formulation in elementary textbooks ; @xmath39 turns out to be accurate . a more formal way to express the contraint from snia at @xmath40",
    "is that they imply @xmath37 . for our guess at the true value of @xmath8 , @xmath41  gyr .",
    "a better value for the age of the universe hinges on nearby matters like the distance to the lmc and metallicity dependence of cepheids !",
