    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like particle with a mass in the range @xmath0  gev is perhaps the single greatest development in high - energy physics in recent memory  @xcite .",
    "if this particle is indeed the higgs scalar , it not only represents the final piece of the standard model ( sm ) , but can potentially open a window into the world beyond the sm .",
    "however , an important question that must be answered is the problem of how such an elementary scalar remains so light against quantum corrections , an issue known as the hierarchy problem .",
    "an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem is supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "one of the best motivated and most studied extensions of the standard model ( sm ) is the incorporaton of susy into the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "however , nature itself is not so elegant since the superpartners have not been observed with the same masses as their sm counterparts , and so susy must be a broken symmetry .",
    "although the exact mechanism and scale at which susy is broken in nature should it exist is not known , simple calculations suggest that the masses of the superpartners should have @xmath11  tev@xmath12 masses if susy solves the hierarchy problem without requiring any fine - tuning .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that there is an upper bound on the higgs mass in the mssm , @xmath13  gev  @xcite , which is in nice accord with the higgs - like resonance observed at the lhc . moreover , in addition to providing a solution to the hierarchy problem , susy with r - parity imposed can provide a natural candidate for dark matter  @xcite .",
    "finally , the apparent convergence of the gauge couplings when extrapolated to high energies is more precise when susy is incorporated compared to the non - susy sm , consistent with the idea of grand unification  @xcite .    despite these many attractive features of susy",
    ", data from the the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been infringing upon this rosy scenario as of late . in particular , the lhc has thus far failed to find any new particles beyond the sm .",
    "indeed , direct searches for squarks and gluinos are pushing the mass limits for these particles into the tev range  @xcite . furthermore , to obtain a @xmath14  gev higgs mass in the mssm",
    "requires large radiative corrections involving the top / stop sector , requiring large stop squark masses @xmath15tev@xmath12 and/or large values of tan@xmath16 . in spite of this , reports of the demise of susy are greatly exaggerated .",
    "indeed , in some extended models it is possible to obtain a @xmath17  gev higgs while maintaining a light spectrum of superpartners  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most - studied framework for supersymmetry breaking is minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , or equivalently the constrained mssm ( cmssm )  @xcite .",
    "however , to obtain a sufficiently large higgs mass in msugra / cmssm seemingly requires heavy squarks and sleptons which generically spoils the naturalness in which the hierarchy problem is solved by introducing some amount of electroweak fine - tuning ( ewft ) .",
    "one possible exception to this is the hyperbolic branch ( hb)/focus point ( fp ) region of the msugra / cmssm parameter space characterized by large @xmath18 in comparison to @xmath19 where the amount of required ewft is minimized in respect to the full parameter space  @xcite .",
    "several different groups have recently reassessed the status of msugra / cmssm in light of the @xmath20  gev higgs discovery  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a similiar analysis in the context of anomaly mediation ) .",
    "it is generally agreed that the msugra / cmssm parameter space is being squeezed by this discovery and pushed into regions which require a degree of fine - tuning . in  @xcite ,",
    "a study of the parameter space in regards to fine - tuning was performed and it was concluded that there are no regions where the higgs is sufficiently heavy and where the relic density may satisfy the wmap constraint that do not require large fine - tuning .    in the following , scans of the msugra / cmssm parameter space have been performed .",
    "viable regions of the parameter space , which appear to fall within the hb region of the cmssm parameter space , are identified .",
    "in contrast to what was found  @xcite , these regions do not seem to require excessive ewft .",
    "the superpartner spectra corresponding to these regions will be found to possess sub - tev neutralinos and charginos , with mixed bino / higgsino lsp s with @xmath1  gev masses .",
    "in addition , the models will be shown to possess @xmath2  tev gluino masses and heavy squarks and sleptons with masses @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "spectra with a higgs mass @xmath21  gev and a relic density @xmath6 are found to require ewft at around the one - percent level , while those spectra with a relic density much lower require ewft of only a few percent . moreover , the spin - independent neutralino - proton cross - sections for direct detection of dark matter for these spectra are below the xenon100 limit  @xcite and should be experimentally accessible in the near future .",
    "finally , it is pointed - out that the supersymmetry breaking soft terms corresponding to these regions of the msugra / cmssm parameter space ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) may be obtained from general flux - induced soft terms in type iib flux compactifications with d3 branes .",
    "the most studied model of supersymmetry breaking is minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , which arises from adopting the simplest ansatz for the k\"ahler metric , treating all chiral superfields symmetrically . in this framework ,",
    "@xmath22 supergravity is broken in a hidden sector which is communicated to the observable sector through gravitational interactions .",
    "such models are characterized by the following parameters : a universal scalar mass @xmath18 , a universal gaugino mass @xmath19 , the higgsino mixing @xmath23-parameter , the higgs bilinear @xmath24-parameter , a universal trilinear coupling @xmath25 , and tan  @xmath16 .",
    "one then determines the @xmath24 and @xmath26 parameters by the minimization of the higgs potential triggering rewsb  @xcite , with the sign of @xmath23 remaining undetermined .",
    "the soft terms are then input into micromegas 2.4.5  @xcite using suspect 2.40  @xcite as a front end to evolve the soft terms down to the electroweak scale via the renormalization group equations ( rges ) and then to calculate the corresponding relic neutralino density .",
    "we take the top quark mass to be @xmath27  gev  @xcite and leave tan  @xmath16 as a free parameter , while @xmath23 is determined by the requirement of rewsb .",

    "in addition to imposing experimental constraints , the spectra are filtered from the final data set if the iterative procedure employed by suspect does not converge to a reliable solution .    a contour plot of the @xmath51 plane for tan@xmath31 is shown in fig .",

    "thus , these spectra result in the higgsino world  scenario  @xcite . due to the heavy masses for the gluino and squarks in these models , it would be very difficult to observe any superpartners at the lhc if the spectrum of superpartners falls into these regions of the parameter space .",
    "however , the prospects for observing superpartners at a linear collider or at a higher - energy hadron collider appear to be more promising .",
    "similar results are obtained for tan@xmath58 and tan@xmath59 as can be seen in fig .",

    "the areas covered in green indicate regions of the parameter space with a relic density which falls into the wmap preferred range.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    one of the strongest reasons for introducing low - scale susy is to solve the hierarchy problem . the parameter space which has been found does this , however it is an important question whether or not this is accomplished naturally without reintroducing any fine - tuning ( the _ little hierarchy problem _ ) .",
    "ordinarily , such spectra with large scalar masses would generically be considered fine - tuned .",
    "this is not necessarily true for those spectra which fall in the hb region of the parameter space , such as those falling upon the red and black bands of fig .",
    "[ fig : msugra_countourplanetb30 ] .",
    "the amount of fine - tuning with respect to the electroweak scale ( ewft ) is typically signified by the fine - tuning parameter @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the percent - level of ewft is then given by @xmath69 .",
    "it should be noted that for most of the parameter space explored in this analysis @xmath70 is dominant , and so generally we have @xmath71 . in  @xcite , it is argued that @xmath72 only provides a measure of the minimum amount of fine - tuning in regards to the electroweak scale and provides no information about the high scale physics involved in a particular model of susy breaking . in order to provide a measure of how fine - tuned a particular model is given knowledge of how susy is broken at a high energy scale , a parameter called @xmath73 was introduced which is analogous to @xmath72  @xcite . for most of the parameter space",
    "this parameter is given by @xmath74 as we can see , for regions of the msugra / cmssm parameter space with large scalar masses , @xmath73 is very large even for those cases where @xmath72 is small such as in the hb regions .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that , although a particular susy spectrum may be completely natural and solve the hierarchy problem without any fine - tuning , obtaining this spectrum within the msugra / cmssm framework of susy breaking requires large cancellations which only happens for specific sets of soft - terms rather than the general parameter space .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : msugra_finetuningvshiggsmasstb30 ] , a contour plot of @xmath72  vs.  @xmath75 is shown for the parameter space satisfying @xmath76 .",
    "the different colored regions of the plot denote different ranges of @xmath64 . from this plot",
    ", it can be seen that the amount of ewft appears to be proportional to @xmath77 as might be expected from the higgs potential .",
    "in addition , the amount of ewft seems to increase linearly with relic density .",
    "for spectra with a relic density @xmath6 and a higgs mass @xmath78  gev , @xmath79 and thus requires minimum ewft at about the two - percent level . on the other hand , spectra with the same relic density and a higgs mass @xmath80",
    "gev requires minimum ewft at the percent level .",
    "conversley , spectra with a very low relic density can have a @xmath17  gev higgs mass and only require ewft at the five - percent level .",
    "however , in this case the neutralino lsp can only provide a small component of the cold dark matter ( see  @xcite for a similar study prior to the discovery higgs - like resonance ) .",
    "from the analysis of the previous sections , it can be seen that there are spectra within the msugra / cmssm parameter space which may solve the hierarchy problem while only requiring ewft of a percent or greater . however , as discussed in the last section it does require a large amount of fine - tuning to obtain these spectra within the specific framework of supersymmetry breaking , msugra / cmssm . within this framework ,",
    "it is rather unnatural to have a universal scalar mass which is so much larger than the universal gaugino mass , @xmath9 , as large cancellations are required to obtain a light higgs mass .",
    "clearly , it would be desirable to have a specific model of supersymmetry breaking for which large scalar masses in comparison to the gaugino masses arise naturally .    over the past decade , there has been much progress in constructing realistic models in type i and type ii string compactifications  @xcite . in these models , the sm fields are localized within the world - volume of d - branes embedded in a closed 10-d closed string background .",
    "physical observables such as gauge and yukawa couplings are dependent upon the moduli of compactification , which must be stabilized in order to have a true vaccum .",
    "it has been shown that in type iib compactifications non - trivial backgrounds of nsns and rr 3-form field strength fluxes generically fix the vevs of the dilaton and all complex structure moduli .",
    "besides fixing the vevs of the moduli fields , these fluxes may also induce susy - breaking soft terms . as shown in  @xcite , for the most general combination involving both imaginary selfdual ( isd ) and imaginary anti - selfdual ( iasd ) fluxes , the soft terms on d3 branes take the form @xmath81 , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & a^{ijk } = -m_{1/2}h^{ijk}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for real flux backgrounds ( @xmath82  mod  @xmath83 ) , and tan@xmath84 the flux - induced soft terms take the dilaton - dominated form of no - scale supergravity . in addition , for tan@xmath85 one finds that @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which is exactly the form of the soft terms required to match the viable region of the parameter space found in the analysis of the previous sections .",
    "thus , if the mssm is built on d3 branes in type iib string theory with a combination of isd and iasd fluxes in the background , then it is possible to induce soft terms of the form studied in this paper .",
    "in such a model of susy - breaking , large scalar masses with @xmath87 are then completely natural in constrast to the situation with msugra / cmssm where there is no _ a priori _ correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we have surveyed the msugra / cmssm parameter space for tan@xmath58 , tan@xmath31 , and tan@xmath59 with the restriction @xmath89 .",
    "we have found that there are viable areas of the parameter space where the lightest cp - even higgs mass is in the range @xmath43  gev @xmath44  gev , the relic neutralino density is below the wmap constraint , @xmath90 , and standard experimental constraints are satisfied .",
    "these areas of the parameter space appear to lie along the hb regions of the msugra / cmssm parameter space .",
    "the corresponding spectra features neutralinos and charginos with sub - tev masses , gluino masses in the range @xmath57  tev , and heavy squarks and sleptons with masses greater than @xmath91  tev .",
    "the lightest neutralino is a mixture of bino and higgsino .",
    "it would be difficult for these spectra to produce an observable signal at the lhc .",
    "however , the prospects for their observation at a linear collider are much more promising .",
    "while these spectra may not create an observable signal at the lhc , the relic neutralino - proton si cross - sections for dark matter direct detection are currently being probed by the xenon100 experiment . at present",
    ", regions of the parameter space with a higgs mass @xmath60  gev and a relic density in the range @xmath92 have been excluded by the upper limit on the proton - neutralino si cross - section from xenon100 .",
    "however , regions of the parameter space with @xmath61  gev and a relic neutralino density at or below the wmap limit are still viable .",
    "these regions of the parameter space should either be excluded in the next update , or they should see a discernable signal .    we have also investigated the question of fine - tuning with respect to both the electroweak scale and the high scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we have found that the spectra with a large enough higgs mass @xmath43  gev @xmath44  gev and the correct relic density @xmath93 require at least a one - percent ewft , while spectra satifying the higgs constraint but which possess a low relic density are fine - tuned at the five - percent level . as these spectra fall into regions of the parameter space where @xmath94 , these spectra are highly fine - tuned with respect to the high scale , at least within the context of msugra / cmssm .",
    "finally , we have discussed the inducement of susy - breaking soft - terms from supergravity fluxes which appear in type iib string compactifications .",
    "such fluxes may be utilized in regards to the moduli stabilization problem of string theory compactifications .",
    "we have pointed out that for a general combination of isd and iasd fluxes with d3 branes , the soft terms may have exactly the same form as those which give rise to the viable parameter space we have investigated in the paper , namely @xmath95 with @xmath96 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in contrast to msugra / cmssm , having large @xmath18 compared to @xmath19 can potentially arise naturally within the context of type iib flux compactifications , in constrast to the situation with msugra / cmssm .",

    "<S> these constraints include a @xmath0  gev mass for the lightest cp - even higgs and the correct relic density for cold dark matter ( cdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the superpartner spectra corresponding to these regions fall within the well - known hyperbolic branch ( hb ) and are found to possess sub - tev neutralinos and charginos , with mixed bino / higgsino lsp s with @xmath1  gev masses . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the models possess @xmath2  tev gluino masses and heavy squarks and sleptons with masses @xmath3 , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> spectra with a higgs mass @xmath5  gev and a relic density @xmath6 are found to require ewft at around the one - percent level , while those spectra with a much lower relic density require ewft of only a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the si neutralino - proton direct detection cross - sections are found to be below or within the xenon100 @xmath7 limit and should be experimentally accessible now or in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is pointed - out that the supersymmetry breaking soft terms corresponding to these regions of the msugra / cmssm parameter space ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) may be obtained from general flux - induced soft terms in type iib flux compactifications with d3 branes . </S>"
