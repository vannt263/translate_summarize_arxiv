    "metallic compounds containing rare earth elements with partially filled @xmath1 shells , such as cebe@xmath2 or upt@xmath3 , belong to the general category of heavy fermions materials@xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a large pauli susceptibility and specific heat as compared to ordinary metals , which indicate a large effective electronic mass , and also by anomalous transport properties such as non - monotonic temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "these anomalies are usually attributed to the formation of a resonant state at the fermi energy , associated with moment screening , due to the admixture of the electronically active and well localized @xmath1 orbitals with the metallic band of the host . as the kondo screening peak develops , the optical conductivity develops a pronounced low - frequency drude peak .",
    "interband transitions across the fermi energy can also yield strongly temperature - dependent features in the mid - ir optical response .",
    "heavy fermion ( hf ) materials are usually modeled by the periodic anderson model ( pam ) or the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) .",
    "while the siam is able to capture the general physics of moment formation and subsequent kondo screening and is thus sufficient to understand most of the thermodynamics of hf materials , lattice effects like coherence and correlations between different sites are of course completely neglected in such a simplified picture .",
    "coherence effects lead for example to a vanishing low - temperature resistivity in the metallic regime and to the formation of a band insulator in the symmetric pam .",
    "correlations between the sites on the other hand are responsible for various types of phase transitions which lead to an extremely rich phase diagram with metallic , insulating or near insulating regimes depending upon the filling and model parameters .    in the metallic regime of the pam ,",
    "perhaps the most important but also controversial lattice effect is the so called exhaustion as proposed by nozi@xmath4res .",
    "the `` exhaustion '' problem  @xcite occurs when a _",
    "few _ mobile electrons , @xmath5 , have to screen _ many _ local moments , @xmath6 , in a metallic environment , i.e , @xmath7 .",
    "this situation is engendered by the fact that only the electrons within @xmath8 ( where @xmath8 is the single impurity kondo temperature ) of the fermi surface can effectively participate in screening the local moments .",
    "thus the number of screening electrons can be estimated as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the conduction band density of states at the fermi level .",
    "a measure of exhaustion is the dimensionless ratio @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "nozi@xmath4res has argued that @xmath12 is roughly the number of scattering events between a local moment and a mobile electron necessary for the mobile electron s spin to precess around a local moment by @xmath13.@xcite in the case @xmath14 , when the number of screening electrons is much smaller than the number of local moments to screen , magnetic screening is necessarily collective and the single impurity picture becomes invalid .    one further consequence of nozi@xmath4res idea then is @xcite that the small fraction @xmath5 of screened states may be viewed as relatively stable polaron - like particles at low temperatures @xmath15 .",
    "he thus proposed that the screened and unscreened sites may be mapped onto particles and holes of an effective single - band hubbard model , respectively .",
    "the screening clouds can hop from site to site and may effectively screen all the moments in a dynamical fashion .    in previous work",
    ", we extended @xcite this argument to explain the strong reduction of the kondo scale @xcite in the metallic regime of the pam .",
    "the hopping constant of nozi@xmath4res effective model is suppressed relative to the bare one by the overlap of the screened and unscreened states .",
    "this , together with the fact that the filling of the effective hubbard model is very close to half filling ( @xmath16 for @xmath17 ) , suggests that the relevant low - energy scale @xmath18 of the effective model becomes very small , compared to the kondo impurity temperature @xmath8 .    in the crossover regime characterized by temperatures between @xmath8 , where conventional kondo screening begins , and the lattice scale @xmath18 , where coherence forms , the quasiparticle peak and the screened local moment evolve much more slowly than their counterparts in the siam@xcite .",
    "this provides a possible explanation for the slow evolution of the quasiparticle peak seen in photoemission experiments@xcite",
    ". however , these results remain controversial@xcite and are complicated by the fact that photoemission is very surface sensitive@xcite , and probes only the first @xmath19 of the surface under investigation .",
    "thus , predictions for less surface sensitive probes such as transport and optical conductivity are important .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of screening on the optical conductivity and resistivity of the pam .",
    "we find that the resistivity is characterized by an impurity - like regime at high temperatures @xmath20 , a crossover regime with non - universal behavior , and a low temperature regime @xmath21 where coherence begins to form .",
    "the crossover regime is the most interesting and is characterized by the exhaustion of screening states near the fermi surface , as measured by the development of a dip centered at the fermi energy , @xmath22 , in the effective f - d hybridization @xmath23 .",
    "the peak in the resistivity , which marks the upper end of the crossover regime , is a non - universal feature centered at a temperature @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath24 is the temperature at which exhaustion first becomes apparent as a reduction in @xmath26 . in the exhaustion region ,",
    "the drude weight increases strongly with temperature , and the lost weight at low @xmath0 is largely transfered to a mid infra - red ( mir ) peak .",
    "this feature is due to interband transitions and its position matches with the minimum of the direct energy gap between the two quasi - particle bands below and above the fermi energy . both the drude and mir peaks persist up to unusually high temperatures @xmath27 .",
    "we interpret the persistence of these features as well as the unusual decline of the drude weight as @xmath28 as manifestations of nozi@xmath4ires exhaustion scenario .",
    "the hamiltonian of the pam on a @xmath29-dimensional hypercubic lattice is @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath31 destroys ( creates ) a @xmath32 electron with spin @xmath33 on site @xmath34 .",
    "the hopping is restricted to the nearest neighbors and scaled as @xmath35 .",
    "we take @xmath36 as our unit of energy .",
    "@xmath37 is the screened on - site coulomb repulsion for the localized @xmath1 states and @xmath38 is the hybridization between @xmath39 and @xmath1 states .",
    "this model retains the features of the impurity problem , including moment formation and screening , but is further complicated by the lattice effects .",
    "metzner and vollhardt @xcite observed that the irreducible self - energy and vertex - functions become purely local as the coordination number of the lattice increases .",
    "as a consequence , the solution of an interacting lattice model in @xmath40 may be mapped onto the solution of a local correlated impurity coupled to a self - consistently determined host@xcite .",
    "we employ the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm of hirsch and fye @xcite to solve the remaining impurity problem and calculate the imaginary time local green s functions .",
    "we then use the maximum entropy method ( mem)@xcite to find the @xmath1 and @xmath39 density of states and the self - energy@xcite . in the limit of @xmath40",
    "the two - particle vertex corrections to the optical conductivity ( @xmath41 ) vanish identically due to symmetry restrictions @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath41 can be calculated by the knowledge of one - particle self energy through a particle - hole bubble diagram which includes the appropriate electron - photon interaction vertices @xmath42 at each end .",
    "a straightforward calculation of this diagram leads to@xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the lattice volume , @xmath1 is the fermi function , @xmath45 $ ] is the conduction band spectral function and @xmath46 is the noninteracting density of states .",
    "we calculated the transport for a variety of model parameters .",
    "the qmc - mem results are limited to relatively small values of @xmath47 by the qmc procedure and relatively low temperatures where mem may be used to calculate the dynamics . here",
    "we present qmc results for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 for three conduction - band fillings @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the impurity scale @xmath8 was calculated by extrapolating the local susceptibility to @xmath53 ( i.e. @xmath54 ) .",
    "the lattice kondo temperature was similarly calculated by extrapolating the _ effective _ local susceptibility of the pam which is the additional local susceptibility due to the introduction of the effective impurity into a host of d - electrons@xcite .",
    "these extrapolations result @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the three band fillings mentioned above , respectively .",
    "the real part of the optical conductivity calculated with qmc - mem is plotted versus frequency in fig .",
    "[ optical_band ] for several temperatures . as the temperature is lowered @xmath57 two features begin to develop , a drude peak at zero frequency , associated with free quasiparticles , and a mid - ir peak at @xmath58 generally associated with an interband transition as we will discuss later .",
    "= 3.0 in    to be consistent with the way that experimental data is usually analyzed the features in @xmath41 are fit to a lorentzian plus two ( asymmetric ) harmonic - oscillator forms for the higher - energy peak @xmath59 with @xmath60 the relaxation time of the `` free '' quasiparticles , and the constants @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are respectively the weight , center , and width of the mid - ir peak . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fitschemes](a ) , in order to improve the fitting procedure we include a second harmonic - oscillator form centered at @xmath64 .",
    "since this weight can not be fit to the drude form , part of the low frequency spectral weight remains incoherent as @xmath0 is lowered .",
    "an alternative method to separate the contributions of the drude and the mid - ir peak to the spectral weight is to fit the optical conductivity data to a `` generalized '' drude form and a harmonic - oscillator with strength @xmath65 for the mid - ir region as discussed above @xmath66 for a generic fermi - liquid model @xmath67 as was assumed in the previous fitting form .",
    "but , it turns out that treating @xmath68 as a fitting parameter renders the use of incoherent harmonic - oscillator unnecessary as shown in fig .",
    "[ fitschemes ] .",
    "the inset to this figure shows the value of exponent @xmath68 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "= 3.0 in    the spectral weights @xmath69 , @xmath61 , @xmath70 , as well as those from the `` generalized '' fit @xmath71 and @xmath65 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ drude_gamma ] when @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the most surprising result is that there is a significant transfer of weight from high to low frequencies with increasing temperature .",
    "the weight in the drude peak , as measured by either @xmath69 or @xmath71 , rises with temperature at low @xmath0 .",
    "this feature was independent of the fitting procedure applied and was even found if the extrapolation technique of scalapino _",
    "et al._@xcite was employed at low temperatures @xmath15 . the opposite trend is generally expected since the drude peak is associated with the buildup of quasiparticle weight in the single - particle spectra at low temperatures .",
    "= 3.0 in    to interpret the drop in the drude weight with lowering @xmath0 , we calculate the effective hybridization strength @xmath23 , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the local @xmath1 green s function and @xmath76 is the local f - electron self - energy .",
    "@xmath23 is a measure of the hybridization between the effective impurity in the dmf problem and its medium ( for example , in the siam @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the d - band density of states ) .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ drude_gamma ] shows the effective hybridization for the pam near the fermi energy .",
    "@xmath23 begins to develop a dip at the fermi energy at roughly the same temperature where drude weight begins to drop .",
    "the formation of this dip in @xmath23 can be interpreted as an effective reduction or `` exhaustion '' of the states near the fermi energy responsible for screening the local moments . in infinite dimensions , other mechanisms which could be responsible for the dip , such as non - local spin or charge correlations ,",
    "are absent@xcite .",
    "we therefore believe that it can be taken as direct evidence for nozi@xmath4res exhaustion scenario .",
    "concomitant with the development of this dip is a drop in the quasiparticle weight as may be seen from the following simple qualitative argument : the relevant low - energy scale is expected to vary roughly like the kondo temperature of the effective impurity model with @xmath79 as medium , i.e.  @xmath80 . since this scale also sets the width of the quasiparticle peak , whose height is on the other hand fixed to @xmath81 by friedel s sum rule , the weight in the quasi - particle peak is proportional to @xmath82 , which falls exponentially with decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "since the drude peak is formed from quasiparticle excitations , the fall in the @xmath26 also corresponds to a loss in drude weight .",
    "the weight lost in the drude peak as @xmath0 decreases is gained by both the mid - ir peak and the low - frequency incoherent part since we find the total spectral weight to be roughly constant in @xmath0 .",
    "the weight gained in the incoherent part is reflected by an increase in @xmath70 and by the reduction of the exponent @xmath68 .",
    "we observe that for @xmath21 the exponent starts to deviate from its fermi - liquid value @xmath83 , indicating that additional weight is building up in the tail of the low frequency peak .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath71 is basically the same as that of @xmath84 ( cf .",
    "[ drude_gamma ] ) suggesting that there is a low - frequency incoherent contribution to the spectral spectral function , in addition to the quasiparticle peak , due to non - fermi - liquid nature of the problem in this parameter regime .",
    "the remaining transferred weight is gained by the peak in the mid - ir region which is due to excitations between the occupied and unoccupied bands states . since the optical conductivity is constructed from a convolution of lattice spectral functions , the origin of this peak",
    "can be confirmed by inspecting the dispersion of these bands which is plotted in the inset to fig .",
    "[ optical_band ] . here",
    ", the solid line is determined from the real - part of the poles of the lattice propagators , thus it represents the quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "the location of the peaks in the single - particle spectra are denoted by the symbols .",
    "the singly occupied @xmath1-level appears as an almost dispersionless band below the fermi energy .",
    "the energy of the mid - ir peak coincides with that of the interband transition between the two quasiparticle bands below and above the fermi energy at @xmath85 ( this value of @xmath86 is special since it represents most of the points in the brillouin zone of the infinite dimensional lattice . )    both the drude peak and the mid - ir peak in @xmath41 persist up to unusually high temperatures @xmath27 .",
    "in the conventional kondo picture , based upon the single - impurity model , the quasiparticle peak in the dos , and hence both of these features in @xmath41 , are expected to disappear at much lower temperatures relative to the kondo scale .",
    "the slow evolution of these features may be due to a crossover between two energy scales@xcite ; @xmath8 , the screening scale of the impurity model with the same parameters as the pam , which is the temperature where screening starts , and @xmath18 the wilson - kondo scale of the lattice .",
    "this screening regime is extended , over that in the siam , because of the reduction in @xmath26 .",
    "i.e.  as @xmath0 is lowered below @xmath8 , the kondo scale of effective impurity problem in the dmfa is self - consistently reduced .",
    "thus , the slow evolution of @xmath69 , @xmath61 and the quasiparticle peak itself are direct consequences of exhaustion .      the resistivity @xmath87 also displays anomalies due to exhaustion .",
    "@xmath88 versus @xmath0 from a qmc - mem calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ resistivity ] in a semilog plot for three different conduction band fillings @xmath89 .",
    "= 3.0 in    we can see the interplay between the different energy scales of the pam in fig .",
    "[ resistivity ] and distinguish three distinct characteristic temperature regions for the resistivity .",
    "i ) a region of log - linear resistivity which occurs at high temperatures @xmath90 where the single impurity physics is dominant and the correlated sites act like independent ( incoherent ) scattering centers . as a result",
    ", the resistivity displays the log - linear behavior of a dilute magnetic alloy .",
    "ii ) as the temperature is lowered , the resistivity reaches a maximum value at @xmath91 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is non - universal in that it is independent of @xmath8 or @xmath18 which increase with @xmath89 ; whereas @xmath24 decreases with @xmath89 .",
    "at least for the @xmath92 and @xmath93 datasets , @xmath24 corresponds to the temperature at which exhaustion first becomes apparent as a dip in @xmath23 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered further , @xmath94 , a pronounced dip begins to develop in @xmath23 , and is accompanied by a rapid drop in the resistivity .",
    "then , as the decline in @xmath26 slows , the resistivity falls more slowly .",
    "since the impurity scattering rate is expected to vary like @xmath95@xcite , the resistivity can fall with decreasing @xmath26 _ even though the system has not begun to form a fermi liquid_. partial fermi - liquid formation can also contribute to the drop ; however , this effect would be suppressed for small @xmath89 by exhaustion and the concurrent reduction of the effective kondo scale .",
    "for @xmath96 it is uncertain which of the two mechanisms has the dominant contribution to the drop in the resistivity at the top of the crossover regime . also it is unclear why the crossover regime becomes less pronounced as @xmath89 decreases .",
    "however , it seems likely that the drop for small @xmath89 , where exhaustion is most pronounced , is due the drop in the the scattering rate .",
    "whereas for @xmath97 , where there is no exhaustion ( the kondo scale @xmath18 is actually enhanced relative to the impurity scale @xmath8@xcite ) it seems likely that the initial drop is due to partial fermi - liquid formation .",
    "iii ) finally , as the temperature is reduced further , for conduction band fillings @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the resistivity begins to drop quickly at @xmath98 , indicating the onset of fermi - liquid formation at @xmath18 for these fillings .",
    "however for @xmath99 there is no indication of this for temperatures well below @xmath18 . when @xmath100 , the pam forms an insulating gap of width @xmath101@xcite ( which is resonantly enhanced over the impurity scale @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath102 , we expect a drop in the resistivity to occur when the temperature equals roughly the energy difference between the chemical potential and the bottom of the gap .",
    "exhaustion should be most prevalent in heavy fermion materials with low carrier concentration or a low density of conduction band states at the fermi surface .",
    "one such material , for which an extensive study of the optical conductivity has been done , is yb@xmath103as@xmath104 with a kondo scale of @xmath105k @xcite .",
    "this material has strongly temperature - dependent drude and mir ( at roughly @xmath106 ev ) peaks for temperatures ranging from 39k to 320k , as predicted by our model calculation .",
    "in addition , there is a very significant weight transfer from the drude peak to the mir peak as the temperature increases over this range@xcite .",
    "there is also some evidence for a drude weight which drops with lowering the temperature below @xmath24 in a typical paramagnetic hf material like ceal@xmath104@xcite . here",
    ", the transfer of weight is far less apparent , but may be inferred from the analysis of the data , where the inverse of the drude weight ( measured by fitting the optical conductivity to a drude form at low frequencies ) shows an increase with lowering @xmath0 at @xmath107 .",
    "however , in this material , the drude weight vanishes quickly as the temperature is increased to @xmath108 .",
    "thus , exhaustion , and the concomitant protracted evolution of @xmath109 would seem to be less evident in this material than it is in the low carrier system yb@xmath103as@xmath104 .",
    "unfortunately , there is not enough optical data available for paramagnetic hf systems to determine whether the drop in the drude weight and other feature associated with exhaustion are generic features or even to determine their dependence on the f - level degeneracy and the conduction band filling .",
    "we believe that a systematic study of the optical properties of low carrier density hf systems could shed significant light on the importance of exhaustion in these materials .",
    "we have performed a qmc - mem simulation of the infinite - dimensional periodic anderson model to study the optical conductivity in the metallic regime .",
    "we see several anomalies , including : ( i ) a drude peak which persist up to anomalously high temperatures @xmath110 , ( ii ) a mir peak due to interband transitions across the fermi energy , which also persists up to high temperatures @xmath110 , ( iii ) a significant loss of drude weight and f - d hybridization as @xmath111 .",
    "we interpreted these results in terms of nozi@xmath4res exhaustion picture .",
    "finally , we note that since optical measurements are far less surface sensitive than photoemission measurements , the presence of these features in experimental spectra could serve as less controversial evidence for exhaustion in heavy fermion systems .",
