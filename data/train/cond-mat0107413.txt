    "the very subject of this paper has been inspired by the following questions raised by v.e.zakharov in a private conversation about two years ago : ( 1 ) `` what are the geometrical reasons for the boundary of plants leaves to fluctuate in the direction transversal to the leaf s surface ? '' and ( 2 ) `` how to describe the corresponding stable profile ? ''",
    "the answer to question ( 1 ) has came immediately .",
    "it is reasonable to imagine that cells located near the leaf s boundary proliferate more active than ones in the bulk of the leaf .",
    "one possible reason might be purely geometric : the periphery cells are not completely enclosed by the surrounding media and hence have more available space for growth than the cells inside the leaf s body . the corresponding picture of the burdock leaf ( _ arctium lappa _ )",
    "is reproduced in fig.[fig:1]a .",
    "this phenomenon can be observed for various species such as most of types of lettuce ( _ lactuca sativa _ ) or spinach ( _ spinacea oleracea _ ) ... the schematic model of the suggested geometric origin of the leaf s folding is shown in fig.[fig:1]b ( see the explanations below ) .    at the same time",
    "the question ( 2 ) remained unanswered , and in this paper we discuss some possible ways of solution to this problem .",
    "relying on the growth mechanism of a plant s leaf conjectured above , one can propose the following naive construction schematically shown in fig.[fig:1]b .",
    "take some `` elementary '' bounded domain of a flat surface , make finite radial cuts and insert in these cuts flat triangles , modeling the area newly generated by periphery cells . the resulting surface obtained by putting back together all elementary domains and inserted extra triangles is not flat anymore .",
    "continue the process recursively , i.e. make cuts in the new surface , insert extra flat triangles and so on ... one gets this way a surface whose perimeter and area grow exponentially with the radius .",
    "several examples can be found in @xcite .    apparently a similar problem had been discussed for the first time by the russian matematician p.l.tchebychef in his talk `` on the cut of clothes '' in paris on 28 august 1878 , apparently unpublished ( some traces of this talk we found in the web page @xcite ) . among the modern developments of that subject",
    "one can mention the paper @xcite by p.bowers proving in 1997 the theorem on quasi ",
    "isometric embedding of a uniform binary tree into a negatively curved space , as well as the contribution @xcite by s.duval and m.tajine devoted to isometric embeddings of trees into metric spaces for fractal description .",
    "our forthcoming consideration is based on two suppositions : ( i ) the plant s leaf has infinitesimal thickness without any surface tension , and ( ii ) activity of boundary cells is independent on the size of the leaf .",
    "the surface constructed above is called `` hyperbolic '' @xcite .",
    "anyone who pays attention to the tendencies in fashion recognizes in this recursive construction the so  called `` jupe  godets '' . later on we shall call such surfaces the `` surfaces  godets '' . despite this rather transparent geometrical image ,",
    "the very problem under consideration is still too vague .",
    "let us formulate it in more rigorous terms , which allow the forthcoming mathematical analysis .",
    "let us cover the surface  godets by a natural `` lattice '' .",
    "the construction of this `` lattice '' is as follows .",
    "take a 4branching cayley tree . ] .",
    "it is well known that any regular cayley tree , as an exponentially growing structure , can not be isometrically embedded in any space with flat metric .",
    "one can expect that the `` surface  godets  , being by construction an exponentially growing ( i.e. `` hyperbolic '' ) structure , admits cayley trees as possible discretizations .",
    "the reason for such choice is based on the fact that the circumference @xmath5 of the cayley tree ( i.e. the number of outer vertices located at the distance @xmath6 from the tree root ) grows as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the coordinational number of the cayley tree ( @xmath9 for 4branching tree ) .",
    "we shall assume that cayley trees can cover the ' ' surface  godets `` _ isometrically_b isometrically covers the euclidean plane .",
    "] , i.e. without gaps and selfintersections , preserving angles and distances  see figs.[fig:1]b and [ fig : godets2]a .",
    "thus , our further aim consists in describing the relief of the ' ' surface  godets \" in the 3dimensional euclidean space , under the condition that a regular 4branching cayley tree is isometrically embedded in this surface .",
    "_ comment .",
    "_ + let us stress that in our paper we are interested in embedding of open ( i.e. unbounded ) surfaces only",
    ". from many textbooks on noneuclidean geometry we know that exponentially growing surfaces _ with the boundary _ can be isometrically embedded in a euclidean space .",
    "the surface of revolution of the so - called _ tractrix _ around its asymptote is a famous example of such embedding @xcite ",
    "see fig.[fig : pseudo]a . in 3d",
    "euclidean space @xmath10 the pseudosphere is parametrized by the following equations : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "one sees from fig.[fig : pseudo]a that the surface of the pseudosphere has no crumples , and as it is bounded , it contains a _ finite part _ of a cayley tree as an isometric embedding .",
    "we suspect that the pseudospheric structure can be also realized in the plants world .",
    "the picture of the flower of calla lilly reproduced in fig.[fig : pseudo]b supports our claim .    from our discussion , we conjecture that in the natural world both the surface  godets ( sg ) and the pseudospere ( ps ) have equal rights to exist . from the biological point of view",
    "there is no difference between sg and ps  in both cases the same mechanism of cells proliferation is assumed .",
    "however from the topological point of view the very crucial point is the initial structure of the growing surface : if in the initial phase the growing structure is``pipe  like ''",
    ", then one can expect the pseudosphere formation , while if the initial surface is almost flat and all circumference cells are independently growing , we ultimately arrive at a surface  godets .    after this comment we turn to the question of embedding isometrically a 4branching _ infinite _ cayley tree into a 2manifold ( `` surface  godets '' ) , viewed as an open surface in the 3d euclidean space .",
    "take a zero  angled rectangle @xmath14 bounded by arcs and lying in the unit disc @xmath15 as shown in fig.[fig : conf]d . make reflections of the interior of the rectangle with respect to its sides @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and get a new generation of vertices  the new images of the initial zero",

    "proceeding recursively with reflections , one isometrically tessellates the disc @xmath15 with all images of the rectangle @xmath22 .",
    "if one connects the centers of neighboring ( i.e. obtained by successive reflections ) rectangles , on gets a 4branching cayley tree isometrically embedded into the unit disc endowed with the poincar metric @xcite defined as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the differential length and the variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 are complex  conjugated .",
    "it is known that the tessellation of the poincar disc by circular zero  angled rectangles is uniform in a surface of a 2dimensional hyperboloid obtained by stereographic projection from the unit disc @xcite .",
    "the open 2hyperboloid is naturally embedded into a 3d space with _",
    "minkovski metric _ ,",
    "i.e. with metric tensor of signature @xmath27 . however the problem of uniform embedding of an open 2hyperboloid into a 3d space with _",
    "euclidean metric _ deserves special attention and exactly coincides with the main aim of our work  embedding of a 4branching cayley tree ( isometrically covering the unit disc with poincar metric ) into a 3d euclidean space .",
    "such embedding is realized by a transform @xmath28 which conformally maps a flat square @xmath29 in the complex plane @xmath8 to a circular zero  angled rectangle @xmath30 in the unit disc @xmath15 ( see fig.[fig : conf ] ) .",
    "the relief of the corresponding surface is encoded in the so - called _ coefficient of deformation _ @xmath31 coinciding with the jacobian of the conformal transform @xmath32 : @xmath33 our final goal consists in an explicit construction of the function @xmath34 .",

    "suppose now that the growth phenomenon is random : extra area is generated only at randomly chosen ( `` active '' ) sites .",
