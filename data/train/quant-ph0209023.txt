    "in this paper , we present calculations performed on a model system consisting of three - level atoms that interact with two fields .",
    "the atoms are placed in an optical cavity which ensures a sizeable level of interaction , in contrast with single pass schemes . under such conditions ,",
    "the validity of quantum fluctuation calculations based on quantum langevin equations is well established .",
    "we will consider a set of three - level atoms in the so - called @xmath1 configuration , consisting of two ground state sublevels and one excited state .",
    "it is well - known that , in the case of large one - photon detuning ( raman scheme ) , terms involving the ground - excited state coherence and excited state population can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "the three - level system is then equivalent to an effective two - level system in which the spin associated with the ground state sublevels may be squeezed .",
    "because of its simplicity the effective two - level system provides a good understanding of the physical phenomena responsible for the creation of atomic squeezing and allows one to carry out analytical calculations of optimal squeezing .",
    "we study two regimes . in the first ,",
    "the atoms interact with coherent light .",
    "one can achieve atomic self - spin squeezing if the non - linearity of the medium is sufficiently high .",
    "this atomic squeezing originates from the same physical process that gives rise to the squeezing of the field exiting the cavity , predicted theoretically in refs.@xcite and observed experimentally a little later@xcite . in the early 1980 s , it was conjectured that atomic spin squeezing appears as a counterpart of squeezing of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the quantum noise reduction on atomic variables computed in several papers can be obtained by a rotation of the atomic variables of a two - level system interacting with a coherent field .",
    "as shown in @xcite , in order to be relevant , spin squeezing should be computed in the plane orthogonal to the direction of the mean spin .",
    "we have performed full quantum calculations in the relevant basis . here",
    "we generalize the results obtained previously on two - level systems @xcite and three - level ( v ) @xcite systems to the @xmath0 system .    in the second regime ,",
    "the atoms interact with a squeezed incoming field .",
    "this scheme was proposed recently and experimentally tested in a single pass configuration to produce spin squeezing between two excited levels @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the cavity configuration should allow one to enhance the squeezing transfer between two - level atoms and field . in both cases",
    "the transfer was limited by the vacuum field fluctuations .",
    "we find here that the @xmath0 scheme allows for a quasi - perfect squeezing transfer from the field to the atoms .",
    "unlike configurations in which the squeezing occurs between two excited states or between a ground and excited state , the squeezing is created between two long - lived ground states .",
    "such a system offers significant advantages from an experimental perspective .",
    "we consider an ensemble of three - level atoms , the three levels being labelled 1,2,3 in a @xmath0 configuration ( fig .",

    "field @xmath2 transverses the medium in a single pass and drives the @xmath6 transition , while field @xmath4 is confined to an optical cavity and drives the @xmath7 transition .",
    "the detunings from atomic resonance are @xmath8 for the pump , and @xmath9 for the probe .",

    "the intensity of field @xmath2 is assumed to be much greater than that of the quantum field .",
    "the three - level system is described using nine collective operators for the @xmath14 atoms of the ensemble , the populations of levels @xmath15 @xmath16 et @xmath17 , @xmath18 the components of the optical dipoles in frames rotating at the laser frequencies , @xmath19 ( and their hermitian conjugates ) , and the operator associated with the coherence between levels @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( and its hermitian conjugate ) .",

    "for example , @xmath45 can reflect transit - time broadening in the system ; as such , it affects level 3 as well as levels 1 and 2 . typically , the atoms fall out of the interaction area with the light beam in a time of the order of tens of milliseconds , whereas @xmath43 is of the order of the mhz for the excited state . we also include incoherent pumping of levels 1 and 2 with rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , to allow for ground state atoms entering the interaction volume .",
