    "the theoretical success of exploiting the quantum nature of physical systems in certain information processing tasks like prime factorization @xcite and unsorted database search @xcite has motivated the pursuit for the practical realization of quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite . with the demonstration of many quantum algorithms , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )",
    "is now considered as a suitable test - bed for qip .",
    "one of the main challenges for the progress of nmr qip is  how to increase the number of qubits ? \" . in this direction",
    "several attempts are being made , such as ( i ) find molecules with different chemical shifts and j - couplings , and ( ii ) use of dipolar and quadrupolar couplings .",
    "this paper concentrates on one aspect :  how to use dipolar couplings among homonuclear spins ? \" .",
    "this problem is outlined in the following paragraphs .    in nmr , systems consisting of coupled spin-1/2 nuclei form qubits . in order to carry out qip , the spin - system has to meet two main requirements : qubit addressability and mutual coupling among the qubits . in liquid state nmr",
    "using isotropic fluids , the qubit addressability is normally provided by the differences in larmor frequencies of the various spin-1/2 nuclei , while the mutual coupling is normally provided by the scalar ( j ) coupling among the nuclei connected by covalent bonds .",
    "the hamiltonian for a j - coupled spin system is @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the zeeman hamiltonian , and @xmath3 is the coupling hamiltonian . when @xmath4 , the system is said to be weakly coupled , and the hamiltonian can be approximated to @xcite , @xmath5    for qubit addressability , all @xmath6 should be sufficiently dispersed and all @xmath7 should be non - negligible ( @xmath8 1hz ) and unequal in magnitude .",
    "in such a circumstance each spin can be treated as a qubit and the coupled nuclei as several qubits .",
    "the values of @xmath7 depend on the covalent bonds connecting spins i and j , and normally has a small range ( @xmath9 hz ) and becomes too small ( @xmath10 hz ) if the spins are connected by more than 4 - 5 covalent bonds .",
    "this places a natural limit on the number of qubits reachable by liquid state nmr using j - couplings alone . to overcome this limitation the possibility of using dipolar couplings",
    "was considered .",
    "the truncated hamiltonian for dipolar interaction is @xcite , @xmath11 the dipolar coupling @xmath12 , between spins of gyromagnetic ratios @xmath13 and @xmath14 whose inter - distance vector @xmath15 makes an angle @xmath16 with the zeeman magnetic field is of the form @xcite , @xmath17    dipolar couplings among common nuclear species have larger magnitudes ( @xmath18 @xmath19 hz ) and longer range than the scalar couplings . however , in isotropic liquids the time average of @xmath12 vanishes , while in solids there are too many dipolar couplings resulting in broad unresolved lines and loss of qubit addressability . in molecules oriented in a liquid crystal matrix ,",
    "while the intermolecular dipolar couplings are vanishingly small , the intra molecular dipolar couplings survive , scaled down by the order parameter @xmath20 of the liquid crystal @xcite , @xmath21 in such systems one obtains a finite number of sharp well resolved spectral lines making it possible to use such systems for nmr - qip . in the nmr - qip experiments implemented so far ,",
    "the systems have been chosen such that either ( i ) @xmath22 , yielding weakly coupled spin - systems which is the case for the heteronuclear spin - systems @xcite or ( ii ) the coupling @xmath23 is finite and @xmath24 = 0 , i.e. , equivalent - spins case @xcite . in the latter case , the symmetry filtering of energy levels become increasingly difficult for higher number of qubits @xcite .",
    "even though the heteronuclear spins oriented in liquid crystal matrix are excellent for qip since they provide very good qubit addressability as well as large mutual coupling , the use of more than 3 to 4 heteronuclear spins is limited by the extensive hardware requirements .",
    "therefore for reaching larger number of qubits , one needs to utilize homonuclear ( nuclei of same species having same @xmath25 but different chemical shifts ) spins oriented in a liquid crystal .",
    "homonuclear spins oriented in a liquid crystal generally become strongly coupled since the dipolar couplings become comparable to or more than the differences in larmor frequencies @xmath24 . in such a situation ,",
    "the zeeman and the coupling parts of the hamiltonian do not commute .",
    "therefore the eigenstates of strongly coupled spins are obtained as the linear combinations of product states of various spins and the individual spins can no more be treated as qubits .",
    "we propose and demonstrate here that , the @xmath26 eigenstates of a coupled n - spin 1/2 system can be treated as an n qubit system even in the presence of strong coupling . similar idea has already been used in demonstration of qip using quadrupolar ( s @xmath81/2 ) nuclei oriented in high magnetic field , where the 2s+1 non - equidistant energy levels have been treated as n - qubit systems , where @xmath27 .",
    "so far s=3/2 and 7/2 have been utilized respectively as 2 and 3 qubit systems @xcite , for various nmr - qip .    while substantial work has been carried out in nmr - qip using weekly coupled spin systems @xcite , till now the use of the strongly coupled spin systems for qip has not been experimentally demonstrated , presumably because ( i ) spin - selective pulses are not defined in the case of strongly coupled spins @xcite , and ( ii ) the difficulty in constructing a general unitary operator using the evolution under scalar coupling @xcite . the problem of using scalar coupling evolution of a strongly coupled two - spin system for a general unitary transform has recently been addressed theoretically , but extending to a n - spin system is complicated @xcite .",
    "however , we note that unlike spin - selective pulses , the transition - selective pulses are well defined even in strongly coupled spin - systems @xcite and hence it is possible to construct a unitary transformation using transition selective pulses . in section [ 2spinstrong ]",
