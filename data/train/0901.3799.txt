    "two perspectives are used for modeling solid and amorphous materials in the continuum limit .",
    "physicists and rheologists tend to prefer an eulerian treatment where the material can be viewed essentially as a fluid equipped with state variables that provide `` memory '' ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , many in the engineering community prefer a lagrangian description , where the material body is decomposed as a network of volume elements that deform under stress ( see @xcite ) .",
    "continuum mechanical laws derive from point - particle mechanics applied to a continuum element .",
    "the primitive form is resultantly lagrangian , though an eulerian conversion can always be asserted one rewrites the constitutive laws in rate form and expands all material time derivatives in terms of fixed - space derivatives .",
    "be that as it may , a rigorous eulerian switch can be a painstaking mathematical task .",
    "this is especially true of solid - like constitutive laws , which often depend on nonlinear tensor operations and coupled history - dependent state variables , leading to unduly complicated eulerian rate expansions @xcite . to dodge these difficulties , those preferring eulerian - frame",
    "have generally resorted to approximations or added conditions that simplify the final constitutive form . while sometimes warranted , the connection back to lagrangian mechanics becomes clouded , complicating the process of deriving physically motivated constitutive behavior .    in this paper , a field we call the `` reference map ''",
    "is utilized to construct and implement solid - like constitutive laws in eulerian - frame with _ no _ added approximations .",
    "the way the map provides `` memory '' to the system admits immediate computation of kinematic variables crucial to lagrangian solid mechanics . to maintain a clear presentation ,",
    "several avenues of motivation are first provided that discuss the necessary laws of continuum mechanics and the basic quantities of solid kinematics .",
    "the theory of large - strain elasticity , hyperelasticity , is then sketched . in particular , by enabling quick access to the _ deformation gradient _",
    "tensor , the reference map can be used to accurately compute solid deformations without the approximations , ambiguities , or pre - conditions of other eulerian approaches .",
    "three non - trivial deformations are then simulated to verify these points .",
    "in eulerian frame , the flow or deformation of a canonical continuous material can be calculated by solving a system of equations that includes : @xmath0 the first equation upholds mass conservation , and the next two , respectively , uphold conservation of linear and angular momentum .",
    "the flow is described by the velocity field @xmath1 and the stresses by the cauchy stress tensor @xmath2 , which includes pressure contributions .",
    "a consitutive law is then asserted to close the system of equations .",
    "we ultimately intend our approach to apply to any material with a `` solid - like '' constitutive law . by solid - like ,",
    "we mean specifically laws that express the stress tensor in terms of some kinematic quantity that measures the local deformation from some nearest relaxed state .",
    "this trait reflects the microscopic basis of solid stress as arising from potential energy interactions between material microconstituents .",
    "the simplest solid - like response is isothermal elasticity , where total deflection under loading immediately determines the stresses within @xcite .",
    "a less basic example would be elasto - plasticity , where internal stresses derive from a small elastic component of the total strain . here",
    ", the nearest relaxed state can differ from the original unstressed state and may depend on evolving state parameters , temperature , and/or rate @xcite .    to encompass the broad definition above ,",
    "a continuum description for solid - like materials necessitates a rigorous way of tracking local relative displacements over some finite time period . without making any `` small displacement '' approximations ,",
    "a general and robust continuum framework calls for a kinematic field @xmath3 known as the _ motion function_. suppose at time @xmath4 , that a body of material is in an unstressed _ reference configuration_. the body then undergoes a deformation process such that at time @xmath5 , an element of material originally at @xmath6 has been moved to @xmath7 .",
    "the motion is defined by @xmath8 .",
    "we say that the body at time @xmath5 is in a _",
    "deformed configuration_.    the motion can be used to define the _ deformation gradient _ @xmath9 , which is of crucial importance in continuum solid mechanics : @xmath10 note that we use @xmath11 for gradients in @xmath7 only , and always write gradients in @xmath6 in derivative form as above . as per the chain rule ,",
    "the @xmath9 tensor describes local deformation in the following sense : if @xmath12 represents some oriented , small material filament in the reference body , then the deformation process stretches and rotates the filament to @xmath13 in the deformed body .",
    "also , the evolution of @xmath9 can be connected back to the velocity gradient via @xmath14 where we use @xmath15 for material time derivatives .    since @xmath16 for any physical deformation , the deformation gradient admits a polar decomposition @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a rotation , and @xmath19 is a symmetric positive definite `` stretch tensor '' obeying @xmath20 .",
    "to demonstrate the use and simplicity of the method , this paper shall focus on one broad class of materials : large - strain , 3d , purely elastic solids at constant temperature . a thermodynamically valid constitutive form for such materials",
    "is derivable with only minimal starting assumptions . known as _ hyperelasticity _ theory , it has become the preeminent elasticity formulation in terms of physicality and robustness . though other elasticity formulations exist ( e.g. hypoelasticity and other stress - rate models ) the next section will recall how these are in fact specific limitting approximations to hyperelasticity theory .",
    "a brief review of hyperelasticity is provided below to establish the key results and demonstrate the physical basis of the theory ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "an analysis of more complex solid - like behaviors ( e.g. elasto - plasticity , hardening , thermal elasticity ) is left as future work .",
    "in essence , one seeks a noncommittal 3d extension of 1d spring mechanics , where total relative length change determines the force in a fashion independent of deformation path . to institute this , presume that the helmholtz free - energy per unit ( undeformed ) volume @xmath21 and cauchy stress @xmath22 both depend only on the local deformation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is used to designate constitutive dependences on kinematic quantities .",
    "we also assume that if no deformation has occurred ( i.e. @xmath25 ) , then @xmath26 .",
    "some helpful physical principles refine these dependences immensely .",
    "we enforce _ frame - indifference _ by restricting the dependences to account for rotations .",
    "suppose a material element is deformed by some amount , and then the deformed element is rotated . by the frame - indifference principle",
    ", the rotation should not affect the free - energy , and should only cause the stress to co - rotate .",
    "this ultimately restricts eqs [ general ] to @xmath27    next , we enforce _ non - violation of the second law_. a continuum - level expression of the isothermal second law of thermodynamics can be written as the dissipation law @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the deformation rate , familiar from fluid mechanics . following a procedure originally developed by coleman and noll @xcite",
    ", one can prove mathematically that eqs [ less_general ] uphold ineq [ second ] under all imposable deformations only if : @xmath30 likewise , @xmath31 must correspond to a local minimum of @xmath21 .",
    "eq [ elasticity ] along with the zero deformation hypotheses compose the theory of hyperelasticity .",
    "the above argument demonstrates how the assertions of frame - indifference and the second - law require that the assumed dependences of eq [ general ] refine to the form of eq [ elasticity ] .",
    "each valid choice of @xmath32 gives an elasticity law that could represent a continuous elastic solid .",
    "the `` deductive approach '' above has become a frequently used tool in materials theory .",
    "to use hyperelasticity , or deductive solid modeling in general , the ability to calculate @xmath9 during a deformation is crucial . in lagrangian - frame , each point is `` tagged '' by its start point @xmath6 , so @xmath9 can always be computed by differentiating current location against initial . in eulerian",
    "the problem is more subtle , as knowledge of past material locations must somehow be procured . as suggested in @xcite , @xmath9",
    "can be directly evolved by expanding the material time derivative in eq [ f_evolution ] , giving @xmath33 unfortunately , this can not be used to solve the general boundary value problem .",
    "the term @xmath34 can only be computed adjacent to boundaries if @xmath9 is prescribed as a boundary condition .",
    "to assign @xmath9 at a boundary implies that the derivative of motion in the direction orthogonal to the surface can be controlled . in the general boundary value problem ,",
    "this information is outside the realm of applicability ; stress tractions and displacements / velocity conditions can be applied at boundaries , but how these quantities change orthogonal to the surface arises as part of the deformation solution .",
    "another approach that also advects the @xmath9 tensor directly ( more factually the tensor @xmath35 ) is the eulerian godunov method of miller and colella @xcite .",
    "the method solves for elastic or elasto - plastic solid deformation by treating the equations as a system of conservation laws with a nonconservative form for the advection of @xmath35 .",
    "it is a sophisticated , high - order method and has had success representing solid dynamics and deformation , but is aimed primarily at unbounded domains where implementation of a boundary condition on @xmath9 is unneeded .    for pure elasticity , several eulerian",
    ", rate - based approaches have been developed that avoid directly referring to @xmath9 but add in several approximations / assumptions .",
    "begin by presuming isotropy .",
    "it can be shown that this reduces eq [ elasticity ] to @xmath36\\label{elasticity_final}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 are the principal invariants of the left cauchy - green tensor @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "one way to uphold eq [ elasticity_final ] involves first defining a _ strain measure _ @xmath39 that , among other features , must asymptote to @xmath40 in the small displacement limit @xmath41 . to linear order in @xmath42 , the elasticity law",
    "can then be written as @xmath43 taking the material time derivative gives @xmath44 .",
    "the chain rule on @xmath45 generally leads to a long expression in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath46 , which can ultimately be rewritten as some function of @xmath22 and @xmath47 .",
    "eulerian expansion of @xmath48 introduces a term @xmath49 .",
    "once again , the same problem as that encountered in eq [ f_euler ] occurs ; to compute @xmath50 , the full cauchy stress tensor @xmath22 must be assigned at the boundary . while certain components of @xmath22 can be controlled at a boundary namely the traction vector @xmath51",
    " the components describing stresses along a plane orthogonal to the surface can not , in general , be prescribed .    to dodge this difficulty the term @xmath49",
    "is presumed to be negligible . as a consequence of neglecting stress convection , one accepts certain errors in representing dynamic phenomena .",
    "ultimately , what remains is an eulerian constitutive relation for the evolution of @xmath22 @xmath52 where the function @xmath53 derives from the choice of strain - measure .",
    "while @xmath54 is sometimes called the `` strain - rate '' , we note that it is not the time rate of change of a valid strain measure ; the axes of @xmath55 do not rotate with the material . however , @xmath56 in the small displacement limit for all strain definitions . assuming small displacement and small rate of volume change , eq [ rate2 ] reduces to a simple form known as _ hypoelasticity _",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 is an `` objective stress rate '' equal to @xmath59 plus extra terms that depend on the choice of strain measure .",
    "hypoelasticity can be seen as a specific approximation to a physically derived isotropic hyperelasticity law .",
    "be that as it may , eq [ hypo ] is oftentimes asserted as a starting principle by assigning @xmath58 , sometimes arbitrarily , from a list of commonly used stress rates e.g. jaumann rate , truesdell rate , green - naghdi rate ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) thereby cutting off the connection to hyperelasticity .",
    "in fact , there are infinitely many stress rate expressions upholding frame - indifference that qualify as objective hypoelastic rates .",
    "rate forms for elasticity require the assumptions and approximations listed herein , which limit their applicability .",
    "the neglect of stress convection can pay heavy consequences when attempting to represent waves or other dynamic phenomena . while eq [ rate2 ] is fairly general for isotropic linearly elastic materials ,",
    "the resulting equations usually require tedious calculation that must be redone if the stress / strain relation is changed . even in the small strain limit , hypoelasticity s presumptions of linearity and isotropy poorly represent some common materials . for instance , granular matter is nonlinear near zero strain ( due to lack of tensile support ) , and crystalline solids are not isotropic .",
    "rate elasticity , if used as a first principle , also offers no physical basis to account for thermodynamics , making it troublesome for theories of thermalized or non - equilibrium materials .",
    "to sidestep these issues , we now describe a new eulerian approach to solid mechanics .",
    "the key is to utilize a fixed - grid field that admits a direct computation of @xmath9 .",
    "define a vector field called the _ reference map _ @xmath60 by the evolution law : @xmath61 this advection law implies that @xmath62 never changes for a tracer moving with the flow .",
    "combined with the initial condition , the vector @xmath60 indicates where the material occupying @xmath7 at time @xmath5 originally started . by the chain rule ,",
    "a material filament obeys @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath64 altogether , eqs [ basic2 ] , [ elasticity ] , [ advect ] , and [ fnew ] , along with the kinematic expression for the density @xmath65 , compose an eulerian system that solves exactly for hyperelastic deformation .",
    "in essence , what we are suggesting is to obtain solid stress in a fashion similar to fluid stress . for fluids ,",
    "the ( shear ) stress is given by @xmath54 , which is computed from the gradient of @xmath66 .",
    "here , we advect the primitive quantity @xmath62 and use its gradient to construct @xmath9 . the stress is then obtained from @xmath9 by the constitutive law .",
    "this approach alleviates many of the complications discussed previously that arise when attempting to directly advect a tensorial quantity like @xmath9 or @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , unlike the advection law of eq [ f_euler ] , the reference map is easily definable on boundaries provided complete velocity / displacement boundary conditions .",
    "that is , if a boundary point originally at @xmath67 is prescribed a displacement bringing it to @xmath68 at time @xmath5 , then @xmath69 .",
    "we also note that @xmath62 is an integral quantity of @xmath9 and thus a smoother function .",
    "we expect this property to be of benefit numerically compared to methods that directly advect @xmath9 or @xmath22 .",
    "the notion of a map that records initial locations of material has been defined by others in various different contexts . to these authors knowledge",
    ", it has never been used for the purposes of solving solid deformation as described above .",
    "@xcite use an `` original coordinate '' function akin to our reference map in defining a pseudo - concentration method for flow fronts .",
    "the inverse of @xmath3 at time @xmath5 , which is indeed equivalent to the @xmath62 field , is also discussed in belytschko @xcite for use in finite element analysis .",
    "in this section , we describe the discretization of the above system of equations .",
    "our general strategy is to first evaluate @xmath22 , then update @xmath66 using eq [ basic2 ] , and finally evolve @xmath62 with [ advect ] .",
    "time derivatives in eqs [ basic2 ] , and [ advect ] are discretized as a simple euler step , @xmath70 on a two - dimensional grid , with grid spacing @xmath71 , the velocity @xmath66 and reference map @xmath62 are located at corner points @xmath72 , while stresses @xmath22 are located at cell centers , @xmath73 .",
    "thus , away from any boundary , we can compute by finite difference @xmath74 at the mid - point of horizontal grid edges , and similarly , @xmath75 on vertical grid edges , @xmath76 we obtain @xmath77 at cell centers by averaging , allowing us to compute the deformation gradient tensor @xmath9 using eq [ fnew ] , and thus @xmath78 .",
    "we now can define stresses at cell centers by specifying the hyperelasticity law .",
    "we compute @xmath79 at the mid - point of vertical grid edges , and similarly , @xmath80 on horizontal grid edges , @xmath81 as a result , we obtain @xmath82 at cell corners , where @xmath66 is stored .",
    "finally , @xmath47 in equation [ basic2 ] , can be discretized in the same manner as @xmath77 .",
    "additionally , since eq [ advect ] is an advection equation , we use a weno discretization for @xmath77 to guarantee stability @xcite .    in order to solve the system with irregular boundaries ,",
    "we introduce a level set function , @xmath83 .",
    "we define @xmath84 inside the solid , @xmath85 outside , thus implicitly representing the domain boundary as the zero level set of @xmath83 .",
    "choosing @xmath83 to be a signed distance function , i.e. @xmath86 , allows us to compute the cut - cell length @xmath87 , with @xmath88 .",
    "for example , if the boundary cuts a horizontal cell edge , i.e. @xmath89 , then @xmath90 here , we must change the discrete derivatives in eq [ eq : dxi_dx_discretization ] . assuming that @xmath91 , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a boundary condition for @xmath62 .",
    "other derivatives near boundaries are treated in the same manner .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )      in this section we present two large - deformation numerical tests , both in plane - strain for simplicity . to rigorously test the method , each case models a non - trivial , inhomogeneous deformation .",
    "first , we solve our system in a circular washer geometry for which the outer wall is fixed and the inner wall is rotated over a large angle . under the levinson - burgess hyperelasticity law",
    "( see below ) , this environment has an analytical solution , which we use to verify the consistency / correctness of the method .",
    "second , we solve the deformation of a disk being stretched into a triangular shape , also utilizing the levinson - burgess law .",
    "this has no analytical solution , and demonstrates the method s applicability in cases where the reference and deformed boundary sets differ .",
    "we focus here on static solutions , obtained by enforcing the boundary conditions and waiting for transients to pass .",
    "artificial viscosity was added to the stress law to expedite collapse to the static solution .",
    "the levinson - burgess free - energy function , after application of eq [ elasticity_final ] , induces the following stress law under plane - strain conditions @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 are invariants of the @xmath78 tensor , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in the unstrained state ,",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 represent the bulk and shear moduli . throughout",
    ", we use @xmath101100 kpa .",

    "[ [ stretched - disk ] ] stretched disk + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the unstressed material shape is a disk that is inscribed perfectly within its final equilateral triangular shape . for @xmath107 on the triangle edge ,",
    "the boundary condition for the final deformed body is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the disk center , @xmath110 the disk radius , and @xmath111 the distance between the disk edge and the triangle as measured along the radial segment containing @xmath107 .",
    "hence , each point on the disk edge is moved outward radially to the triangle .",
    "the final , static displacement field is shown in figure [ washer_triangle](b ) .      in this section ,",
    "we display the method s ability to accurately track the motion of a large - strain compression wave .",
    "recall from section [ past ] , that dynamic correctness is sacrificed in many stress - rate models by neglecting stress convection terms .",
    "the reference map on the other hand , enables high - accuracy representation of elasto - dynamics as shall now be demonstrated .    in order to check for the ability of the method to handle dynamic situations",
    ", we choose to produce an analytical solution for an elastic compresssion wave . for this purpose , consider a material obeying the following large - strain elasticity law ,    @xmath112 for @xmath113 the left stretch tensor . the material body is a rectangular slab constrained in the thickness direction ( i.e. plane - strain conditions ) .",
    "the unstressed material density is uniform and has a value @xmath114 .    under this constitutive law ,",
    "the following @xmath62 and @xmath66 fields give an exact , analytical solution for a rightward moving compression wave passing through the slab : @xmath115 @xmath116 due to symmetry , the @xmath117 and @xmath118 components of both fields do not change from their initial , unstressed values .",
    "the constant @xmath119 is the wave speed .",
    "this solution invokes a large - strain deformation with compressive strain as high as @xmath120 at the center of the pulse .",
    "consequently , this represents a realistic test of the ability of the present approach to tackle dynamic effects as well as large - strain deformation .",
    "the equations are discretized in space as before , but for the time discretization we embed the euler step described above into a standard second order runge - kutta scheme @xcite .",
    "the stability restriction of this fully explicit scheme is so that @xmath121 , for some small constant @xmath87 . from this approach",
    "we expect second order global convergence .",

    "the travelling wave solution should come back to it original shape and location at @xmath124 . for a sequence of grids with @xmath125 , we set @xmath126 using @xmath127 , and compute the @xmath128error of @xmath62 , @xmath129 as ,    @xmath130    we report in figure [ dynamic](a ) the expected second order global convergence .",
    "the convergence rate between the two finest grids , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , is computed to be @xmath133 .",
    "we have also found nearly identical convergence properties for the velocity ; the @xmath134 velocity s convergence rate is found to be @xmath135 between the two finest grids .",
    "we conclude the scheme is globally second order accurate for all dynamic variables , confirming its ability to capture dynamic solutions under large - strain elasticity .",
    "finally , figure [ dynamic](b ) shows one - dimensional cross sections for @xmath136 at different times .",
    "the solid line represents the exact solution computed from eq [ eq : v_exact_solution ] at @xmath4 , which , by periodicity of the domain , also corresponds to the solution at @xmath124 .",

    "also , a method to institute traction boundary conditions within this framework , especially the traction - free condition , would be important future study .",
