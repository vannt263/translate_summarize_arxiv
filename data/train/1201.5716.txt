    "although results on the resonant structure of the decay have been reported by the e791  @xcite and focus  @xcite collaborations , studies of higher precision are required .",
    "in particular , neither of these previous analyses differentiated between @xmath0 and @xmath4 decays .    an important goal in flavor physics is the precise determination of the ckm unitarity triangle angle @xmath14 ( denoted by others as @xmath15 ) , the phase of @xmath16 relative to @xmath17 .",
    "this parameter can be measured through the study of interference effects in the decay @xmath18 . here",

    "experimentally , in order to obtain the best possible knowledge of @xmath14 it is important to make use of as many @xmath19 decay modes as possible .",

    "the existing knowledge of the substructure of @xmath24 is however inadequate to make a reliable assessment of the potential sensitivity to @xmath14 , and so improved information is required",
    ".    a search for direct @xmath5 violation in singly - cabibbo - suppressed ( scs ) charm decays is a promising method to test for the contribution of new physics , which in several plausible scenarios could lead to @xmath25 effects , an order of magnitude higher than is expected in the standard model  @xcite .",
    "evidence of @xmath5 violation has recently been reported in two - body scs decays @xcite , hence it is important to look elsewhere .",

    "a superconducting solenoid supplied a 1.5 t magnetic field for cleo ii.v and iii , and 1  t for cleo - c operation , where the average particle momentum was lower . in all detector configurations",

    "a possible background to the signal arises from the decay @xmath47 , and so a @xmath48 veto procedure is performed . if the two pions have an invariant mass compatible with a @xmath48 decay the event is rejected if the flight distance of the @xmath48 candidate from the interaction point , normalized by the assigned error , is greater than two , or either pion has an impact parameter in the transverse plane greater than 1.5  mm .    after all selection criteria 3.0@xmath49 of the remaining events in the cleo  ii.v sample are found to have more than a unique pair of @xmath50 and @xmath20 candidates .",

    "it is necessary to apply a more stringent @xmath48 veto to suppress @xmath61 contamination than in the cleo  ii.v and cleo  iii selections .",
