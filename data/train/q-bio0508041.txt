    "the single most important variable in an electrophysiological whole - cell model is membrane potential , defined as the potential difference across the cell membrane .",
    "it drives both gating of ion channels and fluxes of ions through the membrane .",

    "membrane potential was defined by an ordinary differential equation in which the time - derivative of membrane potential equals the sum of all ion currents through the membrane divided by membrane capacitance .",
    "their model assumed constant ionic concentrations and dynamic concentrations were added in later models ( difrancesco and noble , 1985 ) . while tracking of concentrations made the models more realistic , doing so introduced new problems , including drift of concentrations under repeated stimuli ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ) , over - determined initial conditions and an infinite number of steady states ( guan  et al . , 1997 ; hund  et al . , 2001 ; kneller  et al . ,",
    ".    long - term drift of concentrations is present in the difrancesco - noble ( guan  et al . ,",
    "1997 ) and luo - rudy models ( luo and rudy , 1994 ) .",
    "using numerical simulations , hund et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that the luo - rudy model has a steady state and no concentration drift , when it is assumed that the externally applied stimulus current is carried by potassium ( @xmath4 ) ions and that this ion flux contributes to the rate of change in intracellular @xmath4 concentration .",
    "similarly , kneller  et al .",
    "( 2002 ) demonstrated that this finding also holds true in their model .",
    "however , neither the reason for nor the origin of ion concentration drift has been addressed quantitatively . in this study",
    ", we explain the mechanism of concentration drift ( sec . [",
    "sec : s31 ] ) and examine the number of steady states present in the above models ( sec .",
    "[ sec : steady ] ) .",
    "we also investigate alternative formulations of membrane potential which preserve charge - conservation and electroneutrality .",
    "in particular , we compare what we refer to as the differential and capacitor formulations of membrane potential ( sec .",
    "[ sec : s2 ] ) , and consider issues affected by the formulation of membrane potential ( sec .",
    "[ sec : s3 ] ) . two examples ( sections [ sec : case1 ] and [ sec : case2 ] )",
    "show how membrane potential may be formulated rigorously in a computational model of the cardiac ventricular myocyte developed by winslow et al .",
    "( 1999 ; abbreviated wrj ) .",
    "our results show that the capacitor formulation provides a transparent , well - defined formulation of membrane potential in a spatially homogeneous myocyte model .",
    "following hodgkin and huxley ( 1952 ) , a spatially homogeneous single - cell model is described as a parallel rc - circuit model .",
    "given an initial value , membrane potential @xmath5 is then defined by the differential equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sum of all outwardly directed membrane currents and @xmath8 is total membrane capacitance .",
    "this formulation of membrane potential is referred to as the _ differential formulation_.    membrane potential can be defined by assuming that a cell is a capacitor , consisting of an ideal conductor representing the interior of the cell , a dielectric representing the ability of the cell membrane to separate charge and a second ideal conductor representing the extracellular space surrounding the cell . in this _ capacitor formulation _ , membrane potential is defined as the ratio of charge @xmath9 to total membrane capacitance @xmath8 : @xmath10 charge @xmath9 includes contribution from all charged particles in a cell .",
    "more specifically , membrane potential of a model containing a single intracellular compartment with @xmath11 ion species @xmath12 is given by @xmath13_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the valence of species @xmath15 , @xmath16 is volume of myoplasm and @xmath17 is faraday s constant .",
    "a biophysically detailed model often describes a myocyte using more than two compartments . the capacitor formulation ( [ eq : capacitor ] ) is extended to multiple compartments by describing the cell as a network of capacitors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intracellular]a ) , where each dielectric corresponds to an interface between two compartments .",
    "the interior of a compartment is considered to be an ideal conductor insulated from other compartments by a membrane .",
    "the membrane potentials can be expressed as functions of charges of compartments and of capacitances of interfaces . in particular , a compartment that is completely enclosed within a larger compartment influences the membrane potential of the surrounding compartment only via charge , geometry is irrelevant ( griffiths , 1989 ) .",
    "for example , figures [ fig : intracellular]a and [ fig : intracellular]b show graphical and capacitor representations of a three - compartment cell model .",
    "membrane potentials are given by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , each depending only on net charge of the enclosed volume .",
    "membrane potential is generated by a small number of ions , the bulk ionic concentration is electroneutral ( hille , 2001 ) .",
    "we require that ( 1 ) a model is electroneutral as a whole , that is , the net charge is zero ; and that ( 2 ) the concentrations are spatially homogeneous ( i.e. well - mixed ) in each compartment . since such requirements are not necessarily satisfied in the presence of charged particles , we will show this to be the case for the model presented here .    in an ideal conductor , induced charges balance electric field in such a way that potential is constant inside the conductor .",
    "hence the interior of each compartment is exactly electroneutral in the capacitor approximation and all net charge is located on the compartment boundary .",
    "this is consistent with narrow physiological range of membrane potentials , which also requires that sum @xmath20_i$ ] must be nearly zero .",
    "both anions and cations must be present in each compartment , since the absence of anions ( cations ) would imply that all cations ( anions ) are located on the membrane .",
    "the concentration of ions that comprise the induced charge is extremely low compared to bulk concentrations and can typically be neglected .",
    "for example , in the wrj model , range @xmath21 $ ] mv limits induced charge to correspond to a monovalent ion concentration in range @xmath22 $ ] @xmath23 , which is negligible compared to most intracellular ion concentrations .",
    "electroneutrality of the interior allows the assumption that ion concentrations are homogeneous in each compartment .    in a typical experimental setup",
    ", a myocyte is embedded in an electroneutral solution of essentially infinite volume relative to the cell volume .",
    "while this extracellular space ( es ) is treated like any other compartment in a cell model , the assumption of infinite volume ( implied by constant extracellular concentrations ) brings certain extra complications that will be addressed in the following .",
    "if the myoplasm has charge @xmath9 , charge of the es is @xmath24 .",
    "however , if the charge density of es , @xmath25_e$ ] ( notation as in ( [ eq : genv ] ) ) , is non - zero , then the es has infinite charge which implies infinite membrane potential .",
    "hence , the es must have _ zero _ charge density , but typically _ non - zero _ charge .",
    "the paradox arises from infinite volume : if the charge of the es is finite , the average charge density is zero because no finite flow of ions can change the concentrations within an infinite volume eventhough charge is altered . as with all other compartments ,",
    "all net charge is located on the boundary of the es , and the remainder of the compartment is exactly electroneutral . in conclusion ,",
    "the capacitor approximation of the cell is consistent with the requirement of electroneutrality and the assumption that ions are homogeneously distributed in a compartment .",
    "next , we will study the exact connection between the two formulations of membrane potential . in the differential formulation",
    ", membrane potential is defined as an independent variable and does not depend on ion concentrations , whereas in the capacitor formulation , membrane potential is a function of concentrations .",
    "hence , in the differential formulation initial conditions are over - determined , since initial conditions are assigned independently for interdependent variables .",
    "this issue can be resolved by introducing implicitly - defined ion concentrations in the differential formulation , as will be shown in the following .",
    "for example , assume a one intracellular compartment model with @xmath26 concentrations @xmath27_{\\text{m}}}\\}_{m=1}^m$ ] and @xmath11 currents @xmath28 , is defined in the differential formulation by @xmath29 & { \\frac{dv}{dt}}=-\\sum_{k=1}^ni_k / c_m,\\\\ & \\frac{d}{dt}{[\\text{s}]_{\\text{m}}}=-\\sum_{l=1}^{n_m}i_{a_{m , l}}/(z_mfv ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the volume of the compartment , @xmath31 indexes the @xmath32 currents assigned to ion species @xmath33 of valence @xmath34 .",

    "equation ( [ eq : siv ] ) shows the exact connection of the differential formulation ( [ eq : no5 ] ) to the capacitor formulation ( [ eq : capacitor ] ) ( in the two - compartment case , but the derivation can be generalized to any number of compartments ) .",

    "drift occurs in both the capacitor ( equation [ eq : vforke ] ) and differential formulations ( equation [ eq : vforsimple_diff ] ) of the model , however , the cause of drift is transparent only in the capacitor formulation .",

    "even a minor drift in a single ion concentration will influence membrane potential if it goes uncompensated .",
    "hence drift is inevitable if there exists a current that transports charge and hence affects membrane potential , but does not contribute to any ion concentration .",

    "previously presented descriptions of the drift ( e.g. , hund  et al .",

    "the capacitor formulation expresses membrane potential as a function of charge and capacitance , whereas the differential formulation uncouples membrane potential from concentrations .",
    "the main differences between the two formulations are an integration constant ( the differential formulation is time derivative of the capacitor equation ) , and `` independence '' of membrane potential from concentrations in the differential formulation .",
    "these two issues imply the presence of a dynamic , implicitly - defined ion concentration(s ) in the differential formulation ( sec . [",
    "sec : s31 ] ) , which makes interpreting simulation results difficult and prone to errors , in addition to the presence of spurious drift of concentrations and issues with steady state .",
    "the differential formulation is equivalent to a particular capacitor formulation , which , however , may not be the one intended due to the presence of implicit concentrations .",
    "the capacitor formulation requires `` almost '' electroneutrality and carefully chosen initial conditions due to sensitivity of membrane potential to net charge .",

    "the sinoatrial node model by endresen  et al .  ( 2000 ) uses the capacitor equation for membrane potential .",

    "they showed that when each current is assigned to contribute to some concentration , the implicit concentration is constant . as they point out , the reason for emergence of the conservation law is best understood from the capacitor equation ( [ eq : capacitor ] ) .",

    "they interpret the drift as a consequence of `` non - charge - conservative '' formulation of the model .",
    "however , we proved that a `` non - charge - conservative '' formulation is actually charge - conservative ( sec . [",

    "[ sec : s31 ] ) .",
    "in particular , this means that the equations defining the differential formulation require that the system is always charge - conservative . on the other hand , a model can be `` non - charge - conservation '' , which , however , does not necessarily indicate the presence of concentration drift .",
    "hence , explanation of concentration drift requires study of charge densities implied by , but not explicitly included in , the differential formulation ( sec . [ sec : s31 ] ) .",
    "hund  et al .  ( 2001 ) further state that the differential and capacitor formulations are always equivalent .",
