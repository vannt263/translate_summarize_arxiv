    "the regularization ( in celestial mechanics ) is a transformation of space and time variables , in order to eliminate the singularities occurring in equations of motion . as szebehely show ( see @xcite ) , the purpose of regularization is to obtain regular differential equations of motion and not regular solutions .",
    "the regularization was introduced by levi - civita in 1906 ( see @xcite ) in plane , and generalized by kustaanheimo and stiefel in 1965 ( see @xcite ) in space . at the beginning ,",
    "the regularization was developed for studying the singularities of kepler motion , for analyzing the collisions of two point masses , and for improving the numerical integration of near - collision orbits .",
    "many studies of the regularization problem are in the restricted three - body problem , where there are two singularities .",
    "we can regularize local ( one of them ) , or global .",
    "birkhoff ( 1915 ) , thiele ( 1896 ) , burrau ( 1906 ) , lematre ( 1955 ) , arenstorf ( 1963 ) , rdi ( 2004 ) , szcs - csillik and roman ( 2012 ) , and many other researchers studied the regularization of the restricted three - body problem .    in order to obtain the regularized equations of motion , one introduces a generating function _ s _ , which depends on two harmonic and conjugated functions",
    "_ f _ and _ g_. but there are many harmonic and conjugated functions . using different couples of polynomial functions , one can obtain different methods of regularization .",
    "for the polynomial of second degree we obtain the levi - civita regularization method . by consequence ,",
    "in this article we created a class of regularization methods , which all have in common the idea that _ f _ and _ g _ are harmonic and conjugate polynomial functions .",
    "we studied analytically some properties of these methods .",
    "starting from the graphical representation of the test particle s trajectory in the circular restricted three - body problem in the physical plane , and imposing a set of initial conditions , we obtained trajectories in the regularized plane , using 7 regularization methods .",
    "so , the methods can be compared not only by canonical equations of motion , but also by the shape of the obtained trajectories .",
    "first of all , let us analyze why the regularization is useful in the restricted three - body problem . for simplicity , we shall consider in the following that the third body moves into the orbital plane ( @xmath2 ) . denoting @xmath3 and @xmath4 the components of the binary system ( whose masses are @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , the equations of motion of the test particle ( in the frame of the restricted three - body problem ) in the coordinate system @xmath7 , ( the physical plane ) are ( see equations ( 1)-(2 ) in @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath8    @xmath9    where @xmath10 these equations have singularities in terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this situation corresponds to collision of the test particle with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "if the test particle approaches very closely to one of the primaries , such an event produces large gravitational force and sharp bends of orbit . removing of these singularities",
    "can be done by regularization .    in order to regularize equations ( 1)-(2 ) , we introduce the generalized coordinates @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the generalized momenta @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( see @xcite p. 266",
    "; @xcite ) , and write the hamiltonian and canonical equations of motion : @xmath17 where @xmath18\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath19 here the generalized coordinates and the generalized momenta were : @xmath20 the canonical equations have the general form : @xmath21 the canonical equations obtained from equations ( 1)-(2 ) have , in the + @xmath22 coordinate system , the explicit form : @xmath23 the canonical equations have singularities in terms @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". these singularities can be eliminate by regularization .",
    "the procedure of regularization consists on two transformations : _ the coordinate transformation _ , which gives the shape of the orbit , and _ the time transformation _ , which makes the slow - down motion .",
    "the first step performed in the process of coordinate transformation consists in introduction of new coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let us introduce the generating function @xmath26 ( see @xcite , p.196 ) : @xmath27 a twice continuously differentiable function .",
    "stieffel ( 15 ) write that , in order to obtain the regularized equations of motion it is necessary to impose only one condition on functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 : they must be harmonic and conjugated function , that means we have : @xmath30 the generating equations are @xmath31 with @xmath32 as new generalized momenta , or explicitly @xmath33 where @xmath34 let introduce the following notation : @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the transpose of matrix @xmath38 .    the new hamiltonian with the generalized coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 and generalized momenta @xmath39 and @xmath40 is : @xmath41 +   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac{q}{1+q}f- \\frac{1}{1+q}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\overline{r}_1 } - \\frac{q}{1+q } \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\overline{r}_2}-\\frac{q^2}{2(1+q)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the explicit canonical equations of motion in new variables become : @xmath45 \\\\ \\frac{dq_2}{dt}&=&\\frac{1}{2d } \\left [ 2p_2-\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial q_1 } ( f^2+g^2 ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dp_1}{dt}&=&- \\frac{p_1}{2d } \\cdot \\frac{\\partial^2 } { \\partial q_1\\partial q_2 } ( f^2+g^2 ) +   \\frac{p_2}{2d } \\cdot \\frac{\\partial ^2}{\\partial q_1 \\partial q_1 } ( f^2+g^2 ) - \\frac{q}{1+q } \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_1}+ \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\frac{1}{1+q}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial q_1 } \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\overline{r}_1 }",

    "but there are a lot of harmonic conjugated functions .",
    "we can find harmonic and conjugate polynomial functions , by using the theory of complex functions .",
    "we denote @xmath46 a single complex variable and @xmath47 , @xmath48 a complex - valued function .",
    "( here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two real functions , depending on two real variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 . ) from the theory of complex numbers ( see @xcite ) we know that , if @xmath49 is a complex function , then its real and imaginary parts are harmonic functions .",
    "that means :    @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "considering @xmath52 it results @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "the case @xmath59 ( in table 1 ) is nt relevant for regularization .",
    "if @xmath62 ( in table 1 ) , the physical plane coincides with the regularized plane .",
    "if @xmath63 ( in table 1 ) , we obtain the levi - civita regularization ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see that all pairs of functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 are conjugate , because they verify the relations of cauchy - riemann : + @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    in order to obtain the canonical equations , when @xmath28 and @xmath29 are harmonic and conjugate polynomial functions , we have to write first the corresponding hamiltonian equation .",
    "let us consider the complex variable @xmath90 , which can be written in the trigonometric form : @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",

    "we obtain : @xmath98 the equation of hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "17 ) becomes in this case : @xmath99    and the canonical equations of motion will be : @xmath100    where @xmath101 .",
    "as one can see these equations are still singular . in order to eliminate the singularities we must transform the time .",
    "the second step performed in the process of regularization consists in the time transformation see @xcite . in order to solve the canonical equations of motion",
    ", we introduce the fictitious time @xmath102 , and make the time transformation @xmath103 .",
    "so , the regular equations of motion become :    @xmath104    now , the equations of motion of the test particle do not have singularities .",
    "in order to obtain the trajectories in the regularized plane for different polynomial functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the canonical equations of motion of the test particle must be integrated , using initial conditions .",
    "we denote @xmath105 the initial conditions for the canonical equations ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) in the physical plane , and @xmath106 the initial conditions for the canonical equations in the regularized plane .",
    "the connection between these initial conditions is given by the equations ( see @xcite ) : @xmath107    applying the transformation of coordinates given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , not only the trajectory will be changed , but the positions of the components of the binary system @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be changed too . in table 2",

    "sometimes to one position of @xmath4 in the physical plane correspond two or more positions in the regularized plane .",
    "this fact is normal ( see @xcite ) , and is shown in table 2 .    starting with the initial conditions in the physical plane : @xmath108 we calculated the corresponding initial conditions in the regularized plane , for each regularization method presented in table 1 .",
