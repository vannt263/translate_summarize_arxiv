    "luminous accreting black hole ( bh ) systems are powered by the same mechanism of gravitational energy release from infalling matter , most likely in the form of an accretion disc ( e.g. shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; frank , king , & raine 1992 ) .",
    "regardless of the mass of the central black hole , @xmath1 , comptonized emission from an optically thin hot plasma ( corona ) of unknown geometry is also observed .",
    "this makes the primary hard x - ray continuum ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 ) .    in most systems ,",
    "the x - ray emission from accreting bhs shows strong , aperiodic variability on a wide range of time scales .",
    "however , characteristic time scales of x - ray variability are observed which depend on the bh mass ( mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ; krding et al . 2007 ;",
    "ponti et al .",
    "2012a ) , matching the expected linear scaling of the size of the system with @xmath1 . +",
    "the primary x - ray continuum is reprocessed in any surrounding matter ( guilbert & rees 1989 ) including the accretion disc .",
    "if a certain degree of coherence ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) is conserved in the reprocessing , and this does not occur exclusively in the line of sight to the central regions , light travel time delays are expected between the primary and reprocessed emission ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) .",
    "these so - called x - ray _ reverberation _ lags ( e.g. reynolds et al . 1999 , cackett et al .",
    "2013 , uttley et al .",
    "2014 ) are a powerful diagnostics of the geometry of the corona and of the inner flow .",
    "they allow us to determine the causal relationship between the hard x - ray primary continuum and the reprocessed emission from the inner accretion disc ( e.g. reflection and/or thermal reprocessing ) , thus probing the central region of the system .",
    "x - ray reverberation lags have now been commonly detected in radio quiet active galactic nuclei ( agn , e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2009 ; zoghbi et al . 2010 ; emmanoulopolous , mchardy & papadakis 2011 ; de marco et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ; kara et al .",
    "2013a , 2013b ) .",
    "they have typical amplitudes of tens - to - hundreds of seconds , and appear at relatively high frequencies ( @xmath2 hz ) .",
    "these lags scale approximately linearly with the bh mass , and their amplitude and characteristic frequency are consistent with an origin within a few gravitational radii from the source of primary hard x - ray continuum emission ( de marco et al .",
    "these properties all suggest the lags to be the signature of reprocessing in the innermost accretion flow .",
    "if this is indeed the case , reverberation lags would also be expected in smaller systems , where the accretor is a stellar mass bh in a binary system ( bhxrb ) .",
    "+ however , the light crossing time of one gravitational radius ( @xmath3 ) of the source is smaller in bhxrbs than in agn by a factor determined by the difference in mass ( @xmath4 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "even though bhxrbs can be much brighter than agn , the number of collected photons on the @xmath5-crossing time is significantly smaller .",
    "this has made the detection of reverberation lags in bhxrbs more difficult .",
    "bhxrbs are known to occasionally undergo x - ray outbursts , during which the source passes through different accretion _",
    "states _ and x - ray variability regimes ( e.g. miyamoto et al . 1992 ; belloni et al . 2005 ; belloni et al .",
    "though the physical mechanism driving outbursts and state transitions is not yet fully understood , changes in the geometry of the accretion flow are thought to play a major role ( fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ; done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the emission from the optically thick accretion disc appears to originate at large radii in quiescent / low luminosity states ( e.g. mcclintock , horne & remillard 1995 , esin et al .",
    "2001 ) , while there is evidence of the disc reaching the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) during disc - dominated high - soft states ( e.g. gierlinski & done 2004 ; steiner et al . 2010 ; plant et al .",
    "2014 ) . + the changes in the geometry and/or physical state of the inner regions during hard and intermediate states are less clear ( e.g. done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 ) . by analogy with agn and",
    "assuming a standard accretion disc model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , the x - ray source is expected to be located at a few @xmath5 from the bh , and the reverberation lags should map this distance . however , if reprocessing occurs at larger radii ",
    "e.g. if the disc is truncated at @xmath66 @xmath5  the light travel time sampled by the reverberation lag is expected to be longer .",
    "this condition , combined with the large number of variability cycles within a single light curve , can significantly increase the possibility of detecting reverberation lags in bhxrbs .",
    "bhxrbs have long been known to show _ hard x - ray lags _ , in that high - energy x - ray photons are delayed with respect to those of lower energy ( e.g page , bennetts , & ricketts 1981 ; miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 , nowak et al .",
    "1999 , nowak , wilms & dove 1999 , grinberg et al . 2014 ) .",
    "these studies of x - ray lags were restricted , for many years , to energies @xmath7 kev ( i.e. those covered by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ,",
    "rxte ) , where the spectrum is dominated by the comptonized emission , thus suggesting the lags to be intrinsic to the power law component ( e.g. kotov , churazov & gilfanov 2001 ) . in this spectral band",
    "the main properties of hard x - ray lags are : a characteristic decreasing trend of lag amplitude with decreasing time - scale of x - ray variability ( or equivalently , with increasing frequency ) ; an approximately log - linear dependence on energy , with the amplitude of the lags increasing as a function of energy - bands separation ( e.g. miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 , nowak et al . 1999 ) . in recent years",
    ", the use of xmm - newton data has paved the way to studies of x - ray lags down to @xmath80.4 kev . in this spectral band , the disc component can be directly observed even in the power law - dominated hard state ( e.g. tomsick et al .",
    "2008 , kolehmainen , done , & diz - trigo 2014 ) , and its causal relationship with the other spectral components can be directly explored . from the analysis of a set of xmm - newton data of the bhxrb gx 339 - 4 in the hard state , uttley et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found new behaviour in the x - ray lags properties by extending their study into the soft x - ray band .",
    "in particular , at @xmath92 kev , they observed a steepening of the log - linear dependence on energy ( they detected this feature also in one dataset of cyg x-1 and swift j1753.5 - 0127 ) , and interpreted this result as a signature of the disc variability leading the power law variations on time scales of the order of seconds or longer .",
    "even more drastic changes are observed on variability time - scales shorter than seconds .",
    "indeed , at such high frequencies they found a reversal of the trend , with the disc component now lagging behind the power law component by a few milliseconds .",
    "they interpreted these results as the first evidence of _ thermal reverberation _ : at high frequencies , the fraction of variable thermal disc emission produced by internal heating is low as compared to the fraction of variable disc emission due to thermalization of the power law photons in the disc ( e.g. guilbert & rees 1988 ; wilkinson & uttley 2009 ) . within this scenario",
    "the reprocessed disc emission should track the short - time scale variations of the power law component , with a time delay equal to the light crossing time between the two emitting regions .",
    "hence , according to this interpretation , we expect these same features to be present also during other observations , with possible deviations only related to changes of disc - corona geometry and/or physical condition throughout the outburst .    in this paper we present results obtained from a systematic search for reverberation lags in a sample of bhxrbs , including : gx 339 - 4 , 4u 1630 - 47 , 4u 1957 + 115 , cyg x-1 , gro j1655 - 40 , grs 1758 - 258 , h 1743 - 322 , swift j1753.5 - 0127 , xte j1650 - 500 , xte j1817 - 330 , with the aim of studying their evolution as a function of source state .",
    "we first inspected all the archived xmm - newton observations of these sources as of august 2014 .",
    "however , it turned out that , among them , only gx 339 - 4 has more than two archived observations with high variability power signal - to - noise ( s / n ) up to sufficiently high frequencies ( i.e. @xmath810 hz ) .",
    "this is a necessary condition for the detection and monitoring of reverberation lags .",
    "for this reason we will first focus on the results obtained from the detailed analysis of the xmm - newton and simultaneous rxte observations of gx 339 - 4 ( section [ sec : gx ] ) .",
    "results obtained from the analysis of the rest of the sample will be reported in section [ sect : other ] .",
    "we analyzed the publicly available xmm - newton observations of gx 339 - 4 as of august 2014 . among the observations",
    "analysed , a total of four ( all carried out during the hard state ) turned out to have sufficiently high variability power s / n ratio to enable timing analysis .",
    "the other observations ( mostly carried out during intermediate or soft states of the source ) are either too short or have too low intrinsic variability power to allow us to obtain reliable spectral - timing measurements ( see table [ tab : non - det ] ) .",
    "note that the selection and data reduction criteria are the same as used in de marco et al .",
    "( 2015 , hereafter dm15 ) , thus we refer to this paper ( specifically section 2 and table 1 ) for a more detailed description .",
    "the four xmm - newton observations of gx 339 - 4 presented in this paper belong to two different outbursts , and were carried out on 16 - 18 march 2004 , 26 march 2009 , and 28 march 2010 ( with corresponding observation ids : 0204730201 , 0204730301 , 0605610201 , 0654130401 ) . since the first two belong to consecutive orbits , we combined them to obtain better statistics .",
    "we extended the spectral band coverage up to @xmath830 kev , by also analysing seven simultaneous rxte observations ( ids : 90118 - 01 - 05 - 00 , 90118 - 01 - 06 - 00 , 90118 - 01 - 07 - 00 , 94405 - 01 - 03 - 00 , 94405 - 01 - 03 - 01 ,",
    "94405 - 01 - 03 - 02 , 95409 - 01 - 12 - 01 ) .    for xmm - newton",
    ", we used only epic - pn ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) data taken in timing - mode , and for rxte either good xenon or generic event proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al . 2006 ) data . for the pca we considered data from all the layers of the proportional counter units ( pcu ) simultaneously and continuously switched on during the single observations .",
    "data reduction has been conducted following standard procedures and using the latest xmm - newton calibration files ( ccf ) relevant for the timing - mode ( as of august 2014 ) .",
    "the net exposure time for the xmm - newton observations is of @xmath8175 ks ( 2004 observations ) , @xmath832 ks ( 2009 observation ) , and @xmath833 ks ( 2010 observation ) .",
    "the net exposure time for the rxte observations is of @xmath810 ks ( 2004 observations ) , @xmath88 ks ( 2009 observations ) , and @xmath819 ks ( 2010 observations ) .    during the selected observations ,",
    "the source is in a hard state , with eddington - scaled luminosities ( @xmath10 kev ) of @xmath11 ( 2009 observations ) , @xmath12 ( 2004 observations ) , and @xmath13 ( 2010 observations ) .",
    "these values correspond to average values derived from the currently available estimates and uncertainties on these two parameters ( hynes et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 , muoz - darias et al .",
    "2008 ) . ] , and almost constant hardness ratios ( defined as the ratio between the 13 - 30 kev to the 3 - 13 kev rxte flux , dunn et al .",
    "2010 ) , spanning the range @xmath80.81 ( see also figure 1 of dm15 ) . hereafter we adopt the same nomenclature as used in dm15 , and refer to the analyzed observations as low- , medium- , and high - luminosity .    for the timing analysis we adopted the same sampling used to compute the power spectra in dm15",
    ": for each observation and energy band we computed the cross - spectra from light curve segments of 21 s , 59 s , and 500 s length ( respectively for the high- , medium- , and low - luminosity observation ) , and averaged them to obtain estimates of the frequency - dependent cross - spectrum .",
    "this choice of light curve segments is dictated by the necessity of excluding gaps due to telemetry drop - outs ( which occur mostly when the target source is very bright ) in xmm - newton data .",
    "the light curves have been extracted with a time resolution of 10 ms , thus ensuring a wide frequency coverage ( up to about four decades for the longest segments choice ) .",
    "nonetheless , we limited the analysis to frequencies @xmath1410 hz , since above this threshold the effects of channel cross - talk induced by poisson fluctuations are not negligible and significantly affect the lag estimate ( lewin , van paradijs & van der klis 1988 ; vaughan et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we first analysed the x - ray lags as a function of fourier - frequency , following standard techniques ( e.g. nowak et al . 1999 ,",
    "uttley et al .",
    "the cross - spectrum has been computed between the same energy bands adopted in dm15 , i.e. 0.5 - 1.5 kev and 2 - 9 kev ( using xmm - newton data ) , and between bands 2 - 9 kev and 10 - 30 kev ( using rxte data ) . using the same nomenclature as in dm15 , hereafter we will refer to the three energy bands as _ soft _ , _ hard _ , and _ very hard_. + phase ( @xmath15 ) and time lags ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the centroid of each frequency bin ) as a function of fourier - frequency for each of the observations analysed are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coherence ] .",
    "here we used a standard logarithmic frequency - rebinning .",
    "the phase / time lags are characterized by positive amplitudes over all the sampled frequencies , meaning that light curves in harder bands are delayed with respect to light curves in softer bands . according to past studies , a power law model for the time lags , with index @xmath18 ,",
    "has been proved to qualitatively describe the underlying decreasing trend as a function of frequency in bhxrbs ( e.g. nowak et al .",
    "1999 ; pottschmidt et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case for the _ hard _ vs. _ very hard _",
    "time lags , already well known thanks to the extensive rxte monitoring campaigns .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] clearly shows that complex structures are superimposed on this underlying power law trend .",
    "these structures are commonly observed in bhxrbs ( e.g. miyamoto et al .",
    "1992 ; nowak et al .",
    "1999 ) . as is more easily visible in the phase lag - frequency plots ( top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] ) , the complexity of the lag profiles increases when the _ soft _ x - ray band is considered ( in agreement with grinberg et al . 2014 ) .",
    "in particular , phase lags between the _ soft _ and the _ hard _ band always show a maximum , followed by a drop at high - frequencies . the position of the maximum is shifted to higher frequencies as the luminosity increases , and its amplitude also increases .    to better characterize the deviations of the time lag profile from a smooth decreasing trend as a function of frequency , we carry out a fit with a simple power law model . for the _ hard _ vs. _ very hard _ lag , independently of luminosity , we derive a power law slope consistent with the values commonly found in the literature ( e.g. nowak et al .",
    "1999 ) from the analysis of rxte light curves of bhxrbs .",
    "specifically we estimate slopes of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively for the low- , medium- , and high - luminosity observation ( these models are over plotted on the red data points in fig .  [",
    "fig : coherence ] , middle panels ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ soft _ vs. _ hard _ lags show significantly more structured profiles , substantially deviating from a power law .",
    "the fits also return much steeper trends , with best - fit slopes of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 respectively for the low- , medium- , and high - luminosity observation .    as pointed out in uttley et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the steepening of the _ soft _ vs. _ hard _ lag is due to a drop in lag amplitude at high frequencies , which we observe in all the observations analysed . nonetheless , the low - frequency ( @xmath25 hz ) _ soft _ vs. _ hard _ lags appear to exhibit a similar trend as observed in the _ hard _ vs. _ very hard _ lags over the entire frequency range analysed .",
    "we verify this , by excluding the high frequencies ( @xmath26 hz ) in the _ soft _ vs. _ hard _ lags and performing the fits again .",
    "we obtain best - fit slope values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( these models are over plotted on the black data points in fig .  [",
    "fig : coherence ] , middle panels ) , respectively for the low- , medium- , and high - luminosity observation ( residuals to the power law models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "these values are consistent with those obtained at higher energies , and point to the same underlying variability process producing the low - frequency hard - lags in softer x - ray bands .    the high - frequency drop of time lag amplitude ( producing the negative residuals below the low - frequency power law trend shown in bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] , black data points ) suggests that the hard lags are suppressed above a certain frequency .",
    "this behaviour is observed only when the _ soft _ x - ray band is considered , which contains significant contribution from the disc black - body emission ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : rev ] ) , thus suggesting a link between the two .",
    "reverberation should produce small - amplitude , negative lags between the power law and the disc emission ( i.e. with the disc photons lagging behind the power law photons ) .",
    "this negative - lag component would combine with the overall hard lags at all frequencies , thus reducing their observed amplitude .",
    "however , even if a reverberation component is present over a broad range of frequencies , it will be detectable only at high frequencies , where the amplitude of the hard lag is sufficiently small , e.g. as a consequence of high - frequency suppression .    in agn reverberation lags",
    "are observed at relatively high frequencies ( of the order of @xmath30 hz for relatively low mass sources of @xmath31 m@xmath32 ) . as in bhxrbs ,",
    "the low - frequencies are , instead , dominated by a hard lag component , well - described by a power law with slope close to @xmath33 ( e.g. papadakis , nandra & kazanas 2001 ) .",
    "the high - frequency drop of the hard lag component enables detection of the reverberation lag ( whose amplitude is of the order of tens of seconds for a @xmath31 m@xmath32 source ) . by approximately rescaling the amplitude and the frequency of the reverberation lag observed in agn for the difference of mass with gx 339 - 4 ( specifically assuming a factor @xmath34 ) , reprocessing from the inner regions of the accretion disc ( thus producing a time delay of the order of @xmath35 s ) would dominate at frequencies of the order of @xmath36 hz in this bhxrb , well outside the frequency window we are considering ( i.e. @xmath3710 hz ) .",
    "however , we expect the amplitude of the reverberation lag to scale linearly with the distance from the disc region where reprocessing occurs .",
    "if , for example , this region is not at the isco during the hard state ( see sect [ intro ] ) , e.g. assuming a factor @xmath810 larger distance , a higher - amplitude reverberation lag , of the order of @xmath38 s , is expected . in this case ,",
    "given the observed _ soft _ vs. _ hard _ lag - frequency spectra of gx 339 - 4 ( fig .  [ fig : coherence ] , middle panels ) , a significant contribution from the reverberation lag should be observable at frequencies @xmath391 hz , though a drop to negative values ( as seen in agn ) would probably appear at higher frequencies .",
    "+ if the observed high - frequency drop in the lag - frequency spectra of gx 339 - 4 is associated with the emergence of a reverberation lag , we expect to observe its signature in the frequency - resolved , energy - spectra of the time lags , at the energies where the disc black body emission significantly contributes to the total flux .",

    "the soft x - ray bands ( e@xmath47 2kev ) always lead the hard x - ray bands ( e@xmath39 2kev ) , but the amplitude of the corresponding time delay increases with luminosity . at all luminosities the lag - energy spectra flatten out towards very soft energies . * * @xmath48 0.8 hz : * the lag - energy spectra can be broadly described by a single - slope , luminosity - dependent , log - linear model ( with steeper slopes associated with higher luminosities table [ tab : fits ] ) .",

    "moreover , we exclude the energies around the edges of the response matrix at @xmath51 kev and @xmath82.2 kev , which produce strong residuals , probably an artefact of uncorrected x - ray loading ( xrl ) effects and/or charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) of the epic - pn timing mode ( kolehmainen et al .",

    "a direct link between the emergence of a significant disc component and the presence of the lag is evident .",

    "this behaviour matches well the shift , as a function of luminosity , of the energy at which the disc component starts to contribute significantly to the total x - ray flux .",

    "we followed a similar procedure for the high - frequency lag - energy spectra ( i.e. the 0.8 - 2 hz interval for the low - luminosity observation and the 2 - 9 hz interval for the medium- and high - luminosity observations , bottom panels of fig .",

    "we parametrized the amplitude of the reverberation lag as the maximum difference ( in absolute value ) , @xmath56 , between the measured lag at @xmath372 kev and the extrapolation in the soft band of the high - energy ( e@xmath391.3 kev ) best - fit log - linear model10 kev , because in this band the high - frequency lag - energy spectra show signs of deviations from a single - slope log linear trend ( see altamirano & mendez 2015 for an analysis of the high - energy hard lags in gx 339 - 4 ) ] .",
    "again , we compared @xmath56 with the disc - to - power law flux ratios and the 3 - 30 kev eddington - scaled luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowhighf ] , right panel ) .",
    "the data clearly show that the amplitude of the low - frequency disc - leading feature increases as the source rises in luminosity through the hard state , and the disc - to - power law fraction increases . this same trend is observed also in the 0.2 - 0.8 hz interval , though the increase of @xmath56 with luminosity and disc relative flux is lower by a factor @xmath81.5 ( possibly as a consequence of the fact that these frequencies include contribution from higher - frequency variability components , see sect .",
    "[ sect : lag - freq ] and dm15 , thus diluting the intrinsic lags associated with the low - frequency variability components ) .",
    "on the other hand we find that the absolute amplitude of the reverberation lag decreases as the source rises in luminosity through the hard state , and the disc contribution increases .",
    "it is worth noting that the simple parametrization we adopted to describe the low - frequency disc - leading lag and the high - frequency reverberation lag is not a rigorous description of the intrinsic lag associated with each of these processes .",
    "this would require a detailed modeling of the lag - energy spectrum , which is beyond the aim of this paper .",
    "however , it is possible to show that , for small values of the phase lag ( i.e. @xmath58 rad , as measured for gx 339 - 4 , see upper panels of fig . [ fig : coherence ] ) , the resulting lag is approximately equal to the weighted average of the phase lags associated with each process .",
    "the weights depend on the amplitude of variability of the different processes , and can be estimated from the covariance spectra ( see uttley et al .",
    "2014 ; dm15 ) .",
    "thus , we computed the covariance spectra in the frequency intervals where the reverberation lag is observed , and fit them using the same model described in sect .",
    "[ sect : rev ] .",
    "we estimated the amplitude of variability of the reverberating component ( i.e. the disc component ) relative to that producing the hard lags log - linear trend ( i.e. the power law component ) , and used these values to obtain an estimate of the intrinsic reverberation lag .",
    "we find slightly smaller values ( respectively by @xmath846 percent and @xmath833 percent ) of the reverberation lag during the high and medium luminosity observations than those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowhighf ] ( right panel ) , while the value obtained for the low luminosity observation is consistent , within the errors , with that derived from our simple parametrization . however , even accounting for variations of the relative variability amplitude of the reverberation component with respect to the component producing the hard lags , the decreasing trend shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowhighf ] ( right panel ) is still observed .",
    "this result points to a decrease of the intrinsic reverberation lag amplitude as a function of luminosity .    as pointed out in sect .",
    "[ sect : lag - freq ] , the reverberation lag maps relatively short distances , thus its amplitude is intrinsically small .",
    "for this reason , it is expected to dominate the lag - energy spectrum at relatively high frequencies , as indeed observed here . however , at low frequencies it should combine with the hard lags characterizing the soft band , thus slightly deviating ( towards smaller absolute amplitudes ) the measured lag from the intrinsic value .",
    "the magnitude of this shift depends on the amplitude of the reverberation lag . since the absolute amplitude of the reverberation lag",
    "is observed to decrease as a function of luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowhighf ] , right panel ) , the shift is expected to be smaller at higher luminosities .",
    "in fact , the observed increase with luminosity of the amplitude of the low - frequency disc - leading feature ( fig .  [",

    "the low - frequency disc - leading feature appears as a steepening of the lag - energy spectrum in the soft band , meaning that the long - term variations in the disc component lead those of the power law by fractions of a second .",

    ", the detected x - ray lags should vary accordingly .",
    "the low frequency time lag - energy spectra of gx 339 - 4 can be explained assuming there are three variability processes at play ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "one process is related to the hard x - ray comptonization component and produces hard lags ( positive lags with respect to our reference band , e.g. as described in models of propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations , kotov , churazov & gilfanov 2001 , arvalo & uttley 2006 ) , with a log - linear energy dependence ( sect .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "the other process is associated with the disc component ( e.g. due to propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations throughout the disc ; uttley et al .",
    "2011 ) , and is responsible for soft photons leading the low frequency variability in the x - ray band .",
    "such a process should cause correlated variations of the seed photons flux from the outer to the inner radii , which then modulate the low frequency variations of the hard x - ray comptonization component .",
    "the last process is due to thermal reprocessing of the hard x - ray photons in the disc , and is responsible for producing small - amplitude , reverberation lags ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : disc2 ] ) .",
    "the observed lag - energy spectrum is determined by the average time lag of the impulse responses ( e.g. uttley et al .",
    "2014 ) associated with the three processes in each energy bin . within this picture ,",
    "the reverberation lag is responsible for the observed flattening of the lag - energy spectrum that characterizes the data below @xmath81 kev at low frequencies ( fig .  [ fig : lage ] , upper panels ) .",
    "moreover , since the intrinsic amplitude of reverberation lag decreases with luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowhighf ] , right panel ) , it is also responsible for the observed decrease of the amplitude of the disc - leading feature as a function of luminosity .      at high - frequencies ,",
    "the disc - leading component is suppressed ( see sect . [",
    "sect : lag - freq ] ) , and soft lags ( i.e. whereby soft photons lag behind hard photons ) are observed in all the analysed observations of gx 339 - 4 .",

    "they appear precisely at the energies where the disc emission contributes @xmath3940 percent of the total flux ( sect .",
    "[ sect : rev ] ) .",
    "+ at these frequencies , most of the disc photons come from the inner regions of the flow . here",
    "irradiation of the disc by hard x - ray photons becomes important .",
    "the major effect of increased irradiation is an increase of reprocessed photons into thermal emission . as a consequence , _ reverberation _",
    "is expected : variable hard x - ray emission will drive correlated high - frequency variability in the reprocessed component , with a delay approximately equal to the light travel - time between the two emitting regions .",
    "+ within this scenario , a change in the geometry of the system as the outburst evolves would determine a variation of the illumination pattern of the optically thick disc , as well as of the light travel - time from the primary source to the reprocessing region .",
    "the associated reverberation lag has to directly map these changes .",
    "the high - frequency data show luminosity - dependent variations of the reverberation lag amplitude ( sect .",

    "in particular , the amplitude decreases as the source luminosity increases during the hard state .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with a picture whereby the path from the primary source to the reprocessing region decreases as the outburst evolves .",
    "the distance traced by the reverberation lag can be expressed in terms of the number of gravitational radii , to give a scale - invariant measure of the direct - to - reprocessing region distance . however ,",

    "however , based on the lack of eclipses or dipping , the shape of the tracks on the hardness - intensity diagram ( muoz - darias et al .",
    "2013 and figure 1 in dm15 ) and the non - detection of accretion disc winds traced by high ionisation fe k lines in gx 339 - 4 ( ponti et al .",

    "these values imply a relatively large distance between the primary x - ray source and the reprocessing region .",

    "thus , in order to explain the data , we need the optically thick disc to be truncated , or its inner radii to be not directly observable and/or strongly irradiated by the hard x - ray source . hot flow models , where a hot inner accretion flow is surrounded by a truncated optically - thick cold accretion disc , are viable solutions for the first case ( e.g. done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 and references therein ) . alternatively , assuming the cold disc is not truncated in the hard state , then an optically thick ( i.e. with optical depth at least @xmath81 ) intervening medium ( e.g. a non - homogeneous corona ) is needed to destroy coherence between the directly observed primary emission and the fraction that irradiates the inner disc regions , preventing the detection of reverberation lags from the smallest radii ( to this end note that estimates of the average optical depth of the corona as measured from hard state spectra give values of @xmath71 , higher than in softer states , e.g. done 2010 ) .",
    "in both cases , the variations of the reverberation lag intrinsic amplitude with the outburst evolution imply that the reprocessing region gradually approaches the isco , i.e. either the truncated - disc radius decreases or the optically thick corona recedes / becomes gradually optically thinner .",
    "alternatively , the observed variations of reverberation lag amplitude might be driven by variations of the height of a centrally concentrated corona as a function of luminosity ( e.g. fabian et al . 2014 ) .",
    "+ finally , following the same parametrization procedure as in gx 339 - 4 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : rev ] ) , we estimated the amplitude of the reverberation lag in h 1743 - 322 and compared it to the values obtained from the analysis of gx 339 - 4 .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : highf_l ] we plot the results as a function of 3 - 30 kev eddington scaled luminosity ( the eddington luminosity has been computed using the estimate of 8.5@xmath420.8 kpc for the distance , steiner , mcclintock , & reid 2012 , and assuming a standard mass range of @xmath72m@xmath32 ) , when comparing the eddington scaled luminosities of the different observations of gx 339 - 4 , the relevant error is the error on the flux measurements ( i.e. @xmath73 percent ) .",
    "however , when the luminosity of gx 339 - 4 is compared with the luminosity of h 1743 - 322 , the uncertainty on the distance and bh mass estimates of the two sources must be taken into account .",
    "the corresponding error bars are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : highf_l ] to show the relative difference in luminosity between h 1743 - 322 and the lowest - luminosity observation of gx 339 - 4 . ] .",
    "we find that the lag in h 1743 - 322 is perfectly in agreement with the values and trend observed in gx339 - 4 , indicating that this is not a peculiar property of one source , but a behaviour likely common to bhxrbs , although the lack of suitable data for other systems prevents definitive conclusions on this point .",
    "the aim of the study presented in this paper is to search for and monitor reverberation lags in bhxrbs as a function of the accretion state .",
    "however , most of the observations turned out to be unsuitable for this kind of analysis . only gx 339 - 4 could be studied in detail , with a total of four data sets which sampled the source at three different levels of luminosity during the hard state .",
    "this has allowed us to expand the analysis presented in uttley et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and to follow the evolution of the lags as a function of x - ray luminosity throughout the hard state .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * the x - ray lags of gx 339 - 4 display a significant contribution from the disc component , superimposed on the hard continuum lags .",
    "the disc component leads the hard x - ray variability at low - frequencies , while it lags behind ( reverberation ) the hard x - ray comptonization component at high - frequencies ( in agreement with uttley et al .",
    "2011 ) , as a consequence of thermal reprocessing in the disc .",
    "this behaviour , irrespective of luminosity , is a characteristic feature of the source during the hard state .",
    "* at low frequencies / long time scales , the reverberation lag combines with the hard lags associated with the disc and the power law component ( and possibly due to propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations ) , and is responsible for the flattening of the lag - energy spectra at e@xmath471 kev . *",
    "the reverberation lag is clearly detected , at high frequencies / short time scales , in all the observations of gx 339 - 4 .",
    "the lag intrinsic amplitude decreases with the increase of disc - fraction as the luminosity of the source increases .",
    "these variations of reverberation lag amplitude affect also the low - frequency lag - energy behaviour , causing the low - frequency disc - leading feature in the soft x - ray band to vary with luminosity accordingly . *",
    "our findings imply that the reprocessing region gradually moves to smaller radii , and approaches the isco as the source rises in luminosity through the hard state .",
    "alternatively , a corona whose height decreases with luminosity might explain the observed behaviour . *",
    "the reverberation lag detected in h 1743 - 322 is consistent with the trend of lag amplitude decreasing with luminosity observed in gx 339 - 4 .",
    "finally we note that the described behaviour of x - ray lags should represent a general property of transient bhxrbs .",
    "however , the currently available observations do not allow us to definitely test this hypothesis and derive more general conclusions .",
    "specifically designed , xmm - newton monitoring campaigns of bhxrb outbursts would be needed to accomplish this goal .",
