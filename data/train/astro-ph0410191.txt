    "for comparison we also show the oh spectra of archetype star forming regions in our galaxy : sgr  b2 and orion  irc2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the behavior of the oh lines in ngc  1068 follows that of orion  irc2 , i.e. , emission in all the observed lines ( except in the @xmath253 and @xmath234  @xmath16 m lines ) .",
    "on the other hand , the oh lines in ngc  253 have a similar behavior than in sgr  b2(m ) , i.e. , absorption in the @xmath13 ladder and cross - ladder lines and emission in the @xmath15 ladder ( goicoechea & cernicharo 2002 ) .",
    "hence , the oh rotational lines show distinct trends in two prototype galaxies where the nuclei activity is also different .    due to its large dipole moment and rotational constant , radiative pumping of the rotational levels",

    "hence , the knowledge of the dust continuum properties and its distribution respect to the molecular gas is needed to analyze the oh excitation .",
    "in order to qualitatively understand the contribution of the physical and geometrical parameters to the oh spectrum , we have modeled the first 20 rotational levels of oh with two radiative transfer codes ( lvg and nonlocal ; cernicharo et al .",
    "the hyperfine structure of oh was not included in the calculations .",
    "collisional cross sections of oh with h@xmath0 from offer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have been used with an h@xmath0 ortho  to  para ratio of 3 .",
    "it is obviously more difficult to model the molecular emission / absorption from a galactic nucleus ( an ensemble of molecular clouds ) than to model a single molecular cloud . since the observed extragalactic oh lines are not velocity resolved and the angular resolution is larger than the dimensions of the observed sources , we have just considered a simplified model of an _ ir core @xmath25 oh shell _ as a first approximation",
    "therefore , we have adopted an spherical geometry consisting of a shell of radius r@xmath26 and continuum core of radius r@xmath27 .",

    "alfonso et al . 2004 ) .    in the case of ngc  253",
    ", the mid - ir continuum is confined to the inner @xmath210@xmath10 of the galaxy ( telesco et al .",
    "we have taken this as a lower limit to r@xmath27 in the far  ir . in the other hand , low@xmath14 co observations reveal that the molecular gas extends up to @xmath250@xmath10 ( harrison et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , co @xmath14=76 ( @xmath28@xmath2150  k ) observations show that the bulk of this emission is confined to the inner @xmath215@xmath10 ( bradford et al .",
    "in addition , several oh masers at @xmath218  cm have been detected within the central @xmath210@xmath10 of the nucleus ( frayer et al .",
    "we have assumed that the far  ir oh lines and the ir continuum arises from the @xmath215@xmath10 region , but we note that a more detailed model of ngc  253 could include an extended component of low excitation oh gas ( that will enhance the absorption of the @xmath2119  @xmath16 m fundamental line ; see gonzlez ",
    "alfonso et al .",
    "2004 for the case of arp  220 ) .",
    "in fact , observations of the extended absorption of oh 18  cm lines reveal that oh in the ground ",
    "state is present as far as @xmath245@xmath10 from the nucleus ( turner 1985 ) .",
    "however , here we are mainly interested in the general behavior of the higher energy oh lines and since the iso / lws angular / spectral resolution is poor , we will not add more complexity to the calculations in this work .",
    "we have taken r@xmath27/r@xmath26=0.9 , although we also investigate the effect of the dilution of the radiation arising from the core . from a gray  body fitting of the lws continuum emission",
    "we have adopted a dust opacity law @xmath29^{1.5}$ ] with @xmath30=1 and t@xmath31=41  k.    to compare with the ngc  1068 observations , we have considered that the oh emission also arises from a single component with similar geometry and continuum emission as for ngc  253 .",
    "however , our calculations showed that the oh emission fluxes could only be reproduced if the emission arises from a more compact component with @xmath32@xmath410@xmath10 and @xmath33@xmath25@xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that the oh emission may be dominated by dense gas in cloud cores near the nucleus .",

    "this is due to the increase of the reemission from the gas that do not absorb the core emission .",
