    "since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates , there has been intense interest in transition metal oxides with strongly layered ( quasi ) two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal structures and electronic properties . for a few years now alkali - metal intercalated layered cobaltates , particularly na@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( nxco ) with @xmath14 , have been pursued for their thermoelectric properties.@xcite the recent discovery@xcite and confirmation@xcite of superconductivity in the system na@xmath1coo@xmath15@xmath16h@xmath2o for @xmath0 0.3 when intercalated with water at the @xmath17 level , has heightened interest in the nxco system .",
    "the structure@xcite is based on a 2d coo@xmath2 layer in which edge - sharing coo@xmath18 octahedra lead to a triangular lattice of co ions .",
    "na donates its electron to the coo@xmath2 layer , hence @xmath4 controls the doping level of the layer : @xmath4=0 corresponds to co@xmath6 , s=@xmath19 low spin ions with one minority @xmath20 hole , and @xmath21 corresponds to non - magnetic co@xmath5 .",
    "nearly all reports of non - stoichiometric materials quote values of @xmath4 in the 0.3 - 0.8 range , and the materials seem generally to show metallic conductivity .",
    "the @xmath4=1 endpoint member nacoo@xmath2 , with rhombohedral r@xmath22 m spacegroup@xcite is reported to be a conventional semiconductor.@xcite the isovalent compound licoo@xmath2 has been more thoroughly studied , with the conclusion that it is a nonmagnetic band insulator with 2.7 ev bandgap.@xcite the @xmath23 endpoint has been anticipated by many to be a @xmath24 mott insulator but is less studied ; in fact , the co@xmath6 formal oxidation state in a stoichiometric compound is rare .",
    "the sulfur counterpart cos@xmath2 is metallic itinerant ferromagnet , close to being half metallic .",
    "a decade ago , tarascon and coworkers reported synthesis of coo@xmath2 but were unable to identify a complete structure .",
    "they concluded initially that the co ions lay on a _ distorted _ triangular lattice@xcite .",
    "more recently , further study by tarascon _",
    "et al._@xcite has traced the difficulty in pinning down the structure to the existence of two phases of coo@xmath2 , one stoichiometric and the other having 4% oxygen vacancies .",
    "coo@xmath2 samples are metallic and nonmagnetic , hence can not be said to contain co@xmath6 ions.@xcite    much has been made of the similarities and differences of this cobaltate system compared to the cuprates .",
    "both are layered transition metal oxide materials whose conductivity is strongly anisotropic .",
    "both are in the vicinity of a mott insulator ( although the cobaltate one  coo@xmath2  is not well characterized ) .",
    "it is possible to vary the carrier concentration ( @xmath4 in the cobaltate formula ) in both systems , with the range in the cobaltates yet to be agreed on . in both systems",
    "there are specific superconducting regions : in the cuprates it is a `` dome '' 0.06 @xmath25 0.22 , roughly , while in the cobaltates there are reports both of a dome 0.27 @xmath25 0.33 @xcite and of a t@xmath26=4.5 k plateau for 0.28 @xmath25 0.37.@xcite however , the differences between the cobaltates and cuprates are substantial and expected to be crucial .",
    "cobalt forms a triangular lattice , which frustrates antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order , while the bipartite square cu lattice invites afm order .",
    "the coo@xmath18 octahedra are edge - sharing , rather than corner - sharing , making the bandwidth much narrower and the exchange coupling smaller .",
    "the cobaltates are electron - doped from the ( anticipated ) mott insulator , as opposed to the most common hole - doped cuprates . and most striking , possibly : in the cobaltates t@xmath27=4.5 k compared to t@xmath27 = 130 k ( or higher under pressure ) in cuprates .",
    "another system for comparison is the transition metal disulfide based one , with na@xmath28tas@xmath2@xmath29h@xmath2o as the primary comparison . in the ( nb , ta)(s , se)@xmath2 system ,",
    "charge - density waves compete with superconducting pairing for the fermi surface , with coexistence occurring in certain cases .",
    "the structure of the ( for example ) tas@xmath2 layer is identical to that of the coo@xmath2 layer , consisting of edge - sharing transition metal chalcogenide octahedrons . in these dichalocogenides , as in the cobaltate system , two well defined stages of hydration have been identified.@xcite in the first stage h@xmath2o is incorporated into the same layer as the cation ( typically an alkali ion ) , and in the second stage two h@xmath2o layers are formed on either side of the cation layer .",

    "intercalating this fm compound with h@xmath2o leads again to t@xmath26 @xmath36 4 k. this latter behavior is understood as the water - induced separation of tas@xmath2 layers decreasing the interlayer magnetic coupling sufficiently to inhibit long - range magnetic order , thereby allowing the innate superconducting tendency in the doped tas@xmath2 layer to assert itself .",
    "much of the emphasis , both experimental and theoretical , has been directed toward the superconducting behavior of the cobaltates , but the long - known behavior of the tantalum disulfides just mentioned suggests the superconductivity may not be so distinctive .",

    "@xcite . in addition",
    ", the specific heat @xmath40 is much smaller , with values around 12 mj / mol - k@xmath44 reported.@xcite it is extremely curious that local moments should vanish so near to what has been believed would correspond to a mott insulator ( @xmath4=0 , co@xmath6 in coo@xmath2 ) , and that superconductivity appears only in the moment - free regime . in the strongly interacting single - band triangular lattice picture",
    ", the @xmath23 system corresponds to the half - filled triangular lattice that has been studied extensively for local singlet ( resonating valence bond ) behavior.@xcite the ground state of that model has however been found to be nel ordered.@xcite in any case , the @xmath45 region of superconductivity in nxco is however well away from the expected mott - insulating regime , and the behavior in such systems is expected to vary strongly with doping level .    much of the language used in characterizing this system ( above , and elsewhere ) has been based on the local orbital , single band picture . as discussed more fully below , the doping in this system occurs within the threefold @xmath20 complex of the co ion , with degeneracy only slightly lifted by the non - cubic structure .",
    "the question of single - band versus multiband nature of this cobaltate system is possibly one of the more important issues to address , because it can affect strongly the tendency toward correlated electron behavior .",
    "although the primary interest has been in the superconductivity of nxco , there is first a real need to understand the electronic structure of the normal state of the unhydrated material , and its dependence on the doping level @xmath4 .",
    "the electronic structure of the @xmath4=1/2 ( with ordered na ) compound in the local density approximation ( lda ) has been described by singh.@xcite within lda all co ions are identical ( `` co@xmath46 '' ) , the co @xmath20 states are crystal - field split ( by 2.5 ev ) from the @xmath47 states , and the @xmath20 bands are partially filled , consequently the system is metallic consistent with the observed conductivity .",
    "the @xmath20 band complex is @xmath48 1.5 ev wide , and is separated from the 5 ev wide o 2@xmath49 bands that lie just below the co @xmath50 bands .",
    "singh suggested that the expected on - site coulomb repulsion ( which has not been calculated ) is @xmath51=5 - 8 ev on co , which gives @xmath10 so that correlation effects can be anticipated .",
    "notwithstanding the experimental evidence for nonmagnetic co ions in the superconducting material , most of the theoretical discussion@xcite has focused on the strongly interacting limit , where @xmath51 is not only important , but in fact is presumed to be so large that it prohibits double occupancy , as described by the single band @xmath52 model .",
    "the lack of local moments and only weak to moderate enhancement of the specific heat @xmath40 suggests that a more realistic picture may be required .",
    "undoubtedly the single band scenario is a limited one : although the rhombohedral symmetry of the co site splits the @xmath20 states into @xmath53 and @xmath54 representations , the near - octahedral symmetry makes them quasi - degenerate .",
    "koshibae and maekawa have shown that the band dispersion in the @xmath20 band complex in these cobaltates displays unexpected intricacies , including some analogies to a kagom lattice.@xcite    in this paper we begin to address the correlation question by taking the strongly correlated viewpoint and using the correlated band theory lda+hubbard u ( lda+u ) method .",
    "we investigate two distinct regions of the phase diagram by focusing on @xmath551/3 , the regime where superconductivity emerges , and @xmath562/3 where more magnetic behavior is observed .",
    "we find that @xmath57 3 ev leads to charge disproportionation ( cd ) and gap opening for both @xmath4=1/3 and @xmath4=2/3 if only fm order is allowed . for the nel ordered case at @xmath4=1/3 ,",
    "the corresponding transition occurs at @xmath58 1 ev . the availability of three distinct sublattices for the ordering , coupled with strong 2d fluctuations , may destroy long - range order and make local probes important in studying charge disproportionation and correlation .",
    "the small values of @xmath59 that we obtain even for @xmath4=1/3 tend to confuse the theoretical picture , since there seems to be a conspicuous absence of correlated electron behavior in this regime of doping .",

    "the @xmath53-projected dos however is nothing like that of the tight - binding model.@xcite the reason is twofold .",

    "the hybridization is evident along the m-@xmath88 line in fig .",
    "[ dos ] ; it is less obvious along the @xmath88-k line because the mixing happens to be accidentally small for the @xmath4=1/3 coo@xmath2 layer structure . for other co - o distances and bond angles , and for @xmath4=0 doping level ( not shown ) ,",
    "the mixing of the @xmath53 band with the lower @xmath54 band becomes much larger .",
    "a second reason for the actual shape of the dos is due to the influence of some second - neighbor hopping,@xcite which makes the @xmath53 band near @xmath89=0 much flatter than the tight - binding model , or even disperse slightly upward before turning downward .",
    "some details of the band structure should be clarified .",
    "the upward dispersion of the @xmath53 band around the @xmath88 point ( mentioned above ) also seems to be affected by interlayer coupling , which can depress the band at k=0 .",
    "johannes and singh have reported that , even for well separated coo@xmath2 layers ( _ i.e. _ when hydrated ) the @xmath53 band may still disperse upward@xcite before turning down . even for coo@xmath2 layer geometries",
    "for which there is no upward curvature , the @xmath53 band remains unusually flat out to almost 1/3 of the way to the zone boundary .",
    "either behavior is indicative of extended hopping processes .    _",
    "magnetic order with lda_. analogous to the results of singh for @xmath90  @xcite , we find ferromagnetic ( fm ) tendencies for @xmath4=1/3 within lda . in disagreement with experiment ( no magnetic order is observed for @xmath91 , nor even any local moment at high temperature ) a half metallic fm result is found , with a moment of 2 @xmath38/supercell that is distributed almost evenly on the three co ions .",
    "the exchange splitting of the @xmath20 states is 0.5 ev , and the fermi level ( e@xmath84 ) lies just above the top of the fully occupied majority bands ( the minority bands are metallic ) .",
    "the fm energy gain is about 45 mev / co . with the majority bands filled ,",
    "the filling of the minority @xmath20 bands becomes @xmath32 , leading to larger @xmath92 hole occupation than for the paramagnetic phase .",
    "hence , unlike the standard assumption being made so far , @xmath63 is a multiband ( @xmath53 + @xmath93 ) system ( within lda , whether ferromagnetic or paramagnetic ) .",

    "whatever the underlying reason , a page can be taken from the high t@xmath26 cuprate chapter of materials physics that , even in the presence of considerable correlation effects , in the magnetically - disordered metallic phase the paramagnetic fermi surface ( fs ) will emerge .",
    "the lack of any observed magnetic behavior in the @xmath00.3 region reinforces this expectation .    in fig .",

    "our calculations indicate that , as long as @xmath113 3 ev as is generally thought , at both @xmath4=1/3 and @xmath4=2/3 there is a strong tendency to disproportionate , with one result being a co@xmath6 ion with a local moment .",
    "disproportionation into an afm honeycomb lattice occurs already by @xmath59 = 1 ev in our mean field treatment . at least in the presence of charge order in a honeycomb arrangement",
    ", there is an afm nearest neighbor exchange coupling @xmath114 mev .",
    "the nel state is known to be the ground state of the afm heisenberg honeycomb lattice .",
    "these charge ordering tendencies may be expected to be strongly opposed by thermal and quantum fluctuations that are expected for low coordination and small spins in 2d layers . to date ,",
    "disproportionation and charge ordering have only been reported for @xmath4=1/2.@xcite    in addition to producing local magnetic moments , charge disproportionation might be expected to introduce new coupling to the lattice . since the radii of co@xmath115 and co@xmath5 differ by 15% ( 0.74    vs. 0.63  ) , disproportionation into those charge states would be expected to couple strongly to local oxygen modes . in octahedral coordination , however , the co@xmath6 ion radius is almost indistinguishable from that of the co@xmath5 ion,@xcite so there may be little evidence in the lattice behavior even if co@xmath5-co@xmath6 charge disproportionation occurs .    in spite of the prevalent theoretical presumption that correlation effects may be playing an essential role in the superconductivity of this cobaltate system , the data seem to be suggesting otherwise . in the @xmath102 0.5 regime ,",
    "indeed local moments are evident in thermodynamic and transport data , spin fluctuations have been observed by neutron scattering , and the linear specific heat coefficients are large , @xmath40=48 - 56 mj / mol - k@xmath44 . comparing this value to our calculated band value , @xmath116 = 10@xmath1172 mj / mol - k@xmath44 , leads to a factor of five enhancement due to dynamic correlation effects .",
    "magnetic ordering around @xmath118 also attests to substantial correlation effects .",
    "our finding of disproportionation for @xmath108 3 ev ( in mean field ) is consistent with the experimental information and a correlated electron picture .    in the superconducting regime",
    "@xmath119 0.3 , the emerging picture is quite the opposite .",
    "the specific heat coefficient is ordinary , with the reported values@xcite clustering around @xmath40= 12 - 13 mj / mol - k@xmath44 indistinguishable the band value @xmath116 @xmath120 13 mj / mol - k@xmath44 .",
    "in addition , there is no local moment ( curie - weiss ) contribution to the susceptibility , and other evidence of enhanced properties is lacking ( magnetic field dependence of the resistivity is small , for example ) . in short , evidence of substantial correlation effects due to the anticipated strong on - site coulomb repulsion",
    "@xmath51 is difficult to find for @xmath1210.5 .",
    "moreover , as discussed in the introduction , the @xmath4=0 endpoint is not a mott insulator , but rather a nonmagnetic metal.@xcite    it is essential to begin to reconcile the microscopic model with observations .",
    "there are several indications that the simple single band picture is oversimplified , one of the most prominent being that there is no evidence that the @xmath53 state is significantly different in energy from the @xmath92 states , _ i.e. _ the @xmath20 degeneracy is still essentially in place . due to the form of dispersion in the coo@xmath2 layer ,",
    "it is still the case that holes doped into the band insulator nacoo@xmath2 go into the @xmath53 band , making it viable to use a single band model in the small @xmath122 regime with a rather robust value of @xmath51 , with a value of @xmath123 3 ev possibly being sufficient to account for correlated electron behavior ( @xmath124 ev ) .",
    "the @xmath121 0.5 regime seems to require reanalysis .",
    "it is quite plausible , based both on the lda band structure and the observed properties , that for @xmath121 0.5 , the system crosses over into a three - band regime where the full @xmath20 complex of states comes into play .",
    "the multiband nature tends to mitigate correlated behavior in at least two ways .",
    "firstly , doped carriers that go into a multiband complex may simply find a smaller `` phase space '' for approaching or entering the mott - hubbard insulating phase , as the carriers have more degrees of freedom .",
    "not completely separate , perhaps , is the extensive study of gunnarsson , koch , and martin,@xcite that strongly suggests that in a multiband system of n bands , the effective repulsion strength becomes @xmath125 . for these cobaltates with carriers in the @xmath20 bands , @xmath126=3 , and @xmath127",
    "3 ev would become @xmath128 3 ev/@xmath129 , and correlation effects diminish considerably .",
    "secondly , screening will increase as hole doping occurs from the band insulator @xmath4=1 , reducing ",
    "perhaps strongly  the intra - atomic repulsion @xmath51 to a value near @xmath130 ..",
    "in this paper we have begun an analysis , coupled with close attention to the observed behavior , of the strength of correlation effects in this cobaltate system that superconducts when hydrated . in this initial work ,",
    "we have used the mean field lda+u method to evaluate the effects of hubbard - like interactions in nxco , and find charge disproportionation and a mott insulating state for coulomb repulsion @xmath51 = 3 ev or less , for both @xmath131 and @xmath132 , when fluctuations are neglected .",
    "ferromagnetic tendencies for small @xmath51 evolve to nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath114 mev for @xmath133 5 ev , at least if charge disproportionation occurs .",
    "the only insulating phase reported so far has been at @xmath4=1/2 , with strong evidence@xcite that it is due to charge disproportionation and charge order ( and probably magnetic order ) .",
    "the @xmath63 lda fs has been described , following the presumption ( based on the observation of at most moderately correlated behavior ) that 2d fluctuations will restore the paramagnetic metallic state .",
    "there are strong indications however that strong interactions , clearly evident for @xmath102 1/2 , have become muted in the regime where superconductivity appears . on the one hand ,",
    "the electronic structure and fs indicate that multiband effects must be considered in this regime , which in itself will decrease the effective repulsion @xmath51 .",
    "independently , @xmath51 will be decreased by screening as the system becomes increasingly metallic . on the experimental side , the behavior of both the magnetic susceptibility and the linear specific heat coefficient point to a lack of `` enhanced '' behavior for @xmath119 0.3 .",
