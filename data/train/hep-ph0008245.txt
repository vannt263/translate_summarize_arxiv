    "we focus in this comment on two flavour active  sterile oscillations .",
    "furthermore we restrict our discussion to that region of oscillation parameter space which induces large lepton asymmetry creation well before neutrino decoupling at @xmath4 mev .",
    "an important issue is the `` final value of the asymmetry '' , that is , the steady state value attained at the end of the dynamical evolution .",

    "@xcite , who conclude that although the asymmetry can rise by five orders of magnitude above the baryon asymmetry level of @xmath13 , it can not reach the @xmath0 range found in ref .",

    "the basic reason turns out to be very simple : dhps neglect the pure mikheyev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite .",
    "as explained in ref.@xcite , pure msw transitions dominate lepton asymmetry evolution at lower temperatures , after the period of initial explosive @xmath12 growth .",
    "the approximate evolution equations derived by dhps have sufficient validity to describe the onset of asymmetry growth , but they are not a good approximation after the explosive amplification phase ends .",
    "their oversight of the role played by msw transitions also leads them to exaggerate the importance of a `` back - reaction term '' [ @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( 51 ) of dhps ] . as we will explain , when this term is large , the msw effect is also dominant so that their eq.(51 ) is no longer valid .",
    "the size of the back - reaction is thus a moot point .",
    "we now clarify the structure of our paper , while simultaneously providing a summary of the main points to be made .",
    "these remarks will be of interest to those readers who want to know the gist of our argument but not the technical details .",
    "* section [ sec2 ] contains a quick survey of the quantum kinetic equations ( qkes ) governing active  sterile neutrino evolution @xcite .",
    "these `` almost exact '' equations are not at issue ; the debate is on their correct solutions .",
    "the qkes simultaneously incorporate coherent matter - affected evolution , decoherence due to non - forward neutrino scattering , and repopulation of active neutrino distribution functions from the background plasma .",
    "* section [ sec3 ] reviews how the essential physics encoded in the qkes can be revealed .",
    "a fundamental issue is collision - dominated versus coherent matter - affected oscillation - driven amplification .",
    "the former pertains to conditions prior to and during the onset of asymmetry growth , in which case the evolution is well described by the static approximation of refs .",
    "@xcite , and by the closely related adiabatic limit approximation developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "equation ( 51 ) of dhps is identical to the leading order term of the static approximation if the @xmath14 term is neglected , and is thus able to correctly predict the existence of a critical temperature @xcite at which asymmetry evolution enters a brief explosive growth phase .",
    "subsequent evolution , however , ceases to be collision dominated .",
    "in addition , a significant asymmetry , typically @xmath15 when explosive growth stops , now exists in the plasma ; the antisymmetric wolfenstein term in the matter potential is sufficiently large to modify the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation patterns in noticeably dissimilar ways .",
    "a vitally important consequence of this is the separation of the neutrino and antineutrino msw resonance momenta @xcite .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath12 , one resonance momentum remains in the body of the ( almost ) fermi  dirac distribution , while the other is rapidly relegated to the tail .",
    "figures 1b and 2b depict this phenomenon for two different oscillation parameter choices .",
    "the separation means that the msw effect , now dominant over the collision mechanism , has very asymmetric consequences for neutrinos and antineutrinos @xcite . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the resonance in the body is able to efficiently convert @xmath17 s into @xmath18 s , while the other is impotent in the scarcely populated tail .",
    "this important physics was not understood by dhps .",
    "indeed , when collisions are absent , neutrino density matrix evolution is driven only by matter - affected propagation ( and the expansion of the universe of course ) .",
    "equation ( 51 ) of dhps _ does not reduce _ to the coherent matter - affected evolution equations , so it does not contain the pure msw effect @xcite .",
    "the static approximation , which yields @xmath19 for zero collision rate , also neglects the msw effect . thus these equations are valid only in the collision dominated regime .",
    "figures 1a and 2a illustrate our arguments .",

    "the dashed curve reveals the physics behind the qkes in a very amusing way .",
    "the generating code compares the decoherence or interaction length @xmath20 with the matter - affected oscillation length @xmath21 at every time step , with both lengths evaluated at resonance .",
    "if @xmath22 is less than one , the static approximation equations are used to forward the system in time . for @xmath23 ,",
    "pure adiabatic msw evolution is employed .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 therefore measures the relative importance of collisions and msw transitions . in the event @xmath25 , the msw effect is damped since collisions seriously disrupt the coherence",
    "the opposite case has @xmath26 , implying that collisions are relatively negligible . the dashed curve in fig .",
    "1a agrees with the qkes in both the high and low @xmath27 regimes extremely well .",
    "there is a slight discrepancy immediately after explosive growth , since neither effect dominates at this stage  the very visible bump in fig .",
    "2a is an artifact of this `` either / or '' approximation in this intermediate regime . *",
    "the dhps equations underestimate the asymmetry after explosive growth even more seriously than does the static approximation , because of their @xmath14 back - reaction term .",
    "section [ sec4 ] compares eq .",
    "( 51 ) of dhps with the static approximation .",
    "as already noted , and acknowledged by dhps , these equations agree to leading order .",
    "we show , however , that the @xmath14 term is large only when the msw effect has taken over as the dominant driver of asymmetry evolution .",
    "since dhps eq .",
    "( 51 ) and the static approximation both neglect this effect , they should not be used when msw transitions are important .",
    "( we will also identify where the msw effect is unwittingly removed in their derivation . ) furthermore , the expansion parameter adopted by dhps in their approximation scheme is not in fact the correct choice at lower temperatures when there is a significant asymmetry in the plasma .",
    "this misunderstanding led dhps to erroneously claim validity for their equations at later stages in the evolution , especially the role of the back - reaction term which is but another casualty following from a faulty expansion parameter .",
    "in fact , the dramatic termination of the asymmetry growth due to this bogus term has its origin in the expression @xmath28 .",
    "the left hand side corresponds to the static approximation ( with a minor discrepancy ) , while the right hand side denotes the dhps result , with @xmath29 identified as the @xmath14 term .",
