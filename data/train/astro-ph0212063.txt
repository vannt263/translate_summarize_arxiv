    "the longstanding problem of the generation of turbulence in various hydrodynamically stable situations has found a solution in recent years with the mhd shear flow instability , also called magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , in which the presence of a magnetic field has a destabilizing effect on a differentially rotating flow with the angular velocity decreasing outwards .",
    "the mri has been formulated decades ago @xcite for ideal taylor - couette flow , but its importance as the source of turbulence in accretion discs with differential ( keplerian ) rotation was first recognized by balbus and hawley , @xcite .",
    "however , the mri has never been observed in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "after goodman and ji @xcite was the absence of mri due to the small magnetic prandtl number approximation used in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number pm is really very small under laboratory conditions ( @xmath10 and smaller , see table [ tab0 ] ) .",
    "let us now concentrate to the small magnetic prandtl number for liquid sodium , i.e. pm @xmath11 .",
    "we start with the results for containers with insulating walls and outer cylinders at rest , ( fig .",
    "there are then linear instabilities even without magnetic fields",
    ". for ha@xmath12 solutions for @xmath13 ( re@xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( re@xmath16 ) are known , see @xcite .",
    "the axisymmetric mode possesses the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "this is also true for nonvanishing magnetic field ; we do not find any crossover of the instability lines for axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric modes .",
    "the same is true for containers with rotating outer cylinder ( fig . [",
    "for growing @xmath17 the reynolds number for the hydrodynamic solution moves upwards , reaching infinity for @xmath18 ( here ) .",
    "the mri is represented by characteristic minima , in our case for @xmath19 at hartmann numbers of order @xmath20 and reynolds numbers of order @xmath9 .",
    "the exact coordinates of the minima are given in table [ tab1 ] .    in order to characterize the hartmann numbers note that for liquid sodium @xmath21 hence , for @xmath22 the magnetic field and the hartmann number have the same numerical values . with @xmath23 @xmath24/s and @xmath25=0.5",
    "it follows from ( [ re ] ) and ( [ ha ] ) f_in= 64re/10 ^ 6(r_out/10cm)^2  hz [ fff ] for the frequency of the inner cylinder .",
    "hence , a container with an outer radius of 22 cm ( see above ) and an inner radius of 11 cm filled with liquid sodium and embedded in vacuum requires a _ rotation of about 19 hz _ in order to find the mri . following ( [ b2.22 ] ) the required magnetic field is about 1400 gauss .    the results for containers with _",
    "conducting walls _ are given in fig .",
    "note that the minimal reynolds numbers given in fig .",
    "[ f2]b are higher than for insulating cylinder walls .",
    "the influence of the boundary conditions is not as small as expected .",
    "the main difference between the two sorts of boundary conditions , however , is the existence of crossovers of the instability lines for @xmath13 and @xmath15 in case of conducting walls . for both resting and rotating outer cylinder hartmann numbers exist above which the nonaxisymmetric mode possesses a lower reynolds number than the axisymmetric mode .",
    "we have already shown the existence of such crossovers for conducting walls for @xmath26 in @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that the occurrence of nonaxisymmetric solutions as the preferred modes is a rather general phenomenon for containers with conducting walls which can become important for the design of future dynamo experiments ( cowling theorem ) .",
    "there are not only stationary patterns of flow and field possible but the instability can also onset in form of oscillating solutions .",
    "this effect is called overstability . in case of rotating convection between two layers heated from below the onset of the instability in form of oscillating solutions",
    "even possesses the lowest eigenvalues for certain prandtl numbers , @xcite .",
    "we find a very similar behavior for the mhd taylor - couette flow between conducting cylinders for resting outer cylinder ( see fig .",
    "[ over ] ) .",
    "it is a pair of waves traveling in positive and negative @xmath27-direction .",
    "note that the cylinder considered here has no bound in vertical direction .",
    "if the cylinder is finite , however , the possibility exists that traveling waves might be combined to standing waves .",
