    "new physics models that involve new strong dynamics often manifest themselves at low energies through new scalar or pseudoscalar fields .",
    "examples of such models are technicolor theories @xcite as well as composite higgs and little higgs models @xcite . recently another class of models that are not directly involved in electroweak symmetry breaking has emerged , going by the name of vector - like confinement @xcite .",
    "the lowest order effective lagrangians that describe these models often have an additional symmetry that forbids the decay of the lightest pseudoscalar at the tree level .",
    "the most prominent example for such a behavior is the low energy effective theory of qcd , where the decay of the neutral pion is only understood after including a higher order term , the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xcite , into the effective action .",
    "the same happens in little higgs models , where t - parity @xcite is only broken after the wzw term is added @xcite .",
    "more generally , when the fermions that condense to form the pseudoscalars come in vector - like representations of all gauge interactions , the most important decay channel for the lightest scalar arises from the wzw term .",
    "the nonvanishing three - point interactions in the wzw term contain at least two gauge bosons , therefore the pseudoscalar will decay dominantly into the lightest available gauge bosons which are usually those of the standard model .",
    "depending on the quantum numbers of the scalars , the decays can be into photons pairs or into @xmath8 or @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be any other standard model gauge bosons , including gluons @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we focus on pseudoscalar electroweak triplets that are pair produced at hadron colliders .",
    "these scalars have significant branching fractions into photon pairs , giving rise to signals with three or four photons in the final state .",
    "multi - photon final states of this kind provide a promising signature at hadron colliders .",
    "one reason is that the standard model backgrounds for these processes are relatively low , so a signal can be found early even if the production cross section is at the femtobarn level , which is quite common for uncolored new states in bsm scenarios .",
    "furthermore , owing to the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeters , the mass of particles decaying to photon pairs can be determined with high accuracy .",
    "finally , information about the spin of the particle can be obtained from angular distributions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the following section a brief overview is given about models that predict triplet scalars and their width and branching fractions are discussed . in section [ pheno : sigbg ] signals and backgrounds are calculated for the 7 tev and the 14 tev lhc . in section [ pheno : mass ]",
    "we determine how precise the mass and spin of the particle can be measured , before we summarize in section [ pheno : end ] .",
    "our main objects of interest are pseudoscalar electroweak triplets @xmath12 that transform as @xmath13 under the electroweak @xmath14 gauge symmetry . the leading interactions with the standard model are contained in the kinetic term @xmath15 a light pseudoscalar @xmath16 can emerge as a pseudo - goldstone boson when it is part of a larger multiplet of some global symmetry that is involved with electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "in this case the above interactions will receive corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the higgs vacuum expectation value and @xmath19 is the breaking scale of the global symmetry .",
    "the scale @xmath19 typically lies around the tev scale so we expect these corrections to be at most 10% .",
    "also the higher point interactions contained in are not of interest here .",
    "we are in particular interested in cases where the @xmath20 are the lightest particles that are odd under an approximate parity symmetry . in moose models , such as the little higgs model with x - parity @xcite",
    ", this happens due to the symmetry structure of the coset spaces , and is a remnant of the original t - parity in these models @xcite .    while it is often assumed that little higgs models originate from a theory that becomes strongly coupled around the 10 tev scale ,",
    "this uv completion is usually not specified .",
    "a concrete example of high - scale strongly interacting dynamics with a remnant parity is vector - like confinement @xcite . the benchmark model discussed in @xcite contains a pseudoscalar triplet with the required quantum numbers . in that case",
    "the accidental parity symmetry appears because the fermions that condense to yield the pseudo - goldstone bosons transform in vector - like representations of the standard model gauge group .",
    "similar models that also contain a pseudoscalar triplet were presented in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : phiprod ]    to a large extent the properties of the triplets are fixed by gauge invariance and by the parity symmetry , so they can be studied independently of the model they belong to .",
    "masses for the triplet are generated through radiative corrections .",
    "the neutral and charged components of the triplet are expected to have roughly the same mass @xmath21 , since a large mass splitting is constrained by the electroweak @xmath22 parameter .",
    "the little higgs model with x - parity @xcite predicts that mass to be of order of the electroweak scale .",
    "the same mass range is assumed in @xcite .",
    "for the present analysis , we will consider @xmath23 due to the approximate parity symmetry , the triplets are mostly produced in pairs via an intermediate @xmath24 or @xmath25 boson , through interactions contained in the kinetic term ( [ eq : ekin : phia ] ) .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for production at hadron colliders are shown in figure [ fig : phiprod ] .",
    "note that there is no direct @xmath26 production due to bose symmetry .",
    "additional contributions to @xmath16 pair production from bsm particles are possible .",
    "for example , the model in @xcite contains an additional vector boson that is produced in the @xmath27-channel and decays into @xmath16 pairs .",
    "the cross sections obtained from the diagrams in figure [ fig : phiprod ] can nevertheless be used as minimal expectations for the pair production rates .    since the lowest order lagrangian is symmetric under pseudoscalar parity the @xmath16 can only decay through the fourth order wzw term : @xmath28 where the dots denote terms that do not contribute to @xmath16 decays at leading order , and the gauge couplings have been absorbed into the definition of the field strength tensor . note",
    "that unlike the case of vector boson decays here the neutral @xmath29 can decay into two photons . on the other hand",
    "the decay @xmath30 is not possible since the corresponding anomaly coefficient vanishes .",
    "the relative branching fractions between @xmath29 decay modes are completely fixed by this expression were already presented in the arxiv version of @xcite.]the nontrivial dependence on @xmath21 that is displayed in figure [ fig : phi0br ] is purely from kinematic suppression .",
    "the total widths in addition depend on the integer @xmath31 and on the scale @xmath19 , and typically lie in the @xmath32 range .",
    "[ fig : phi0br ]    after electroweak symmetry breaking , radiative corrections introduce an additional splitting between the neutral and the charged components of the multiplet . for purely electromagnetic interactions , and in the limit @xmath33",
    ", it was found in @xcite that @xmath34 since there are additional contributions to this mass splitting in models with extended gauge and scalar sectors , we treat @xmath35 as a free parameter .",
    "the decay @xmath36 becomes relevant around @xmath37 and dominant for larger splittings , as shown in figure [ fig : phipbr ] .",
    "this behavior is mostly independent of the absolute mass scale @xmath21 .",
    "[ fig : phipbr ]    for small mass splitting the dominant decay mode for the charged triplet is @xmath38 with a branching fraction decreasing from almost 100% at @xmath39 to around 80% at @xmath40 .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath41 and @xmath42 production are shown in figure [ fig : lhcprod ] for the lhc running at @xmath43 and @xmath44 center of mass energy .",
    "with @xmath45 the production cross sections are sizable up to @xmath40 , while the reach of the current lhc run with @xmath46 and 1 fb@xmath0 of target luminosity is clearly limited .",
    "[ fig : lhcprod ]    in the case of a small mass splitting , @xmath47 , the most interesting signal arises from @xmath41 decaying into @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the splitting is larger than about 5 gev all production channels contribute to a @xmath49 signal @xcite .",
    "our analysis will focus on the inclusive @xmath50 signal , @xmath51 on the case of a small mass splitting . to be definite",
    "we will consider three scenarios with @xmath52 gev , 400 gev and 600 gev .",
    "we use comphep 4.5.1  @xcite with cteq6l1 parton distributions to simulate the processes @xmath53 at @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting events are passed to pythia 6.4 @xcite for hadronization and @xmath54 boson decay and through pgs4 @xcite with the cms parameter set to account for detector efficiencies and energy smearing .",
    "the cuts used for event generation are summarized in table [ tab : cuts0 ] and the resulting cross sections for the 7 tev and the 14 tev lhc are given in table [ tab : sig0 ] .",
    "._cuts used to generate @xmath55 events .",
    "we also require all photons to be separated from the @xmath24 by more than @xmath56 . _ [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : sbcuts ]    also shown in table [ tab : sbcuts ] are the expected signal and background events at the lhc for a luminosity of @xmath57 . from the results",
    "one can conclude that a discovery with a statistical significance of 5 standard deviations is possible for values of @xmath21 up to about @xmath58 .    for the heavy scenario with @xmath59",
    "a 5@xmath60 discovery would only be possible with the full design luminosity of the lhc and further reduction of the backgrounds by imposing stronger cuts on the photon transverse momenta and @xmath61 .",
    "note that the signal selection could be improved further by trying to find a peak in the di - photon invariant mass spectrum above the smooth background .",
    "the lhc is currently running at a center of mass energy of 7 tev and is supposed to collect at least @xmath62 before the shutdown at the end of 2011 .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether this can suffice to detect a signal at least in the light scenario ( @xmath63 ) . from table [",
    "tab : sig0 ] we expect 17 signal events .",
    "the backgrounds are smaller than for the 14 tev case and have an even steeper @xmath64 spectrum . imposing a @xmath64 cut of 60 gev on all photons",
    "we expect 11.4 signal events and 2.0 background events with @xmath62 , thus a discovery at the @xmath65 level is possible",
    ".    finally let us comment on the case of a large mass splitting between @xmath66 and @xmath29 , where the dominant signal is from the @xmath49 final state .",
    "in addition to the @xmath67 channel now also the @xmath42 channel contributes to the @xmath68 final states .",
    "radiating an additional photon in any of the discussed backgrounds events costs an additional factor of @xmath69 , while requiring an additional fake photon reduces the cross section even further .",
    "one can therefore safely assume that the standard model backgrounds to the @xmath70 signal are negligible .",
    "[ fig:4a ]    the cross section for the @xmath68 signal in the large splitting case is determined by multiplying the @xmath16 pair production rates in figure [ fig : lhcprod ] with the branching fractions for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "assuming @xmath73 , almost all of the charged scalars decay into @xmath29 and an off - shell @xmath24 , with br@xmath74 . from an explicit simulation , using as before comphep 4.5.1 , pythia 6.4 , and pgs4 with the basic cuts in table  [ tab : bg0 ] , we obtain that 44% of the signal events are reconstructed by the detector for @xmath63 .",
    "it is expected that the signal efficiency increases slightly for larger @xmath21 , but for simplicity we will assume the same value for the entire mass range .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig:4a ] .",
    "since the backgrounds are negligible , we require a minimum of 5 signal events for a discovery .",
    "this gives a discovery range for the current 7  tev lhc run up to @xmath75 , while the lhc with @xmath76 will be able to probe and the full parameter range up to @xmath77 with about @xmath78 .",
    "the mass of the neutral @xmath29 can be determined directly from the di - photon invariant mass distribution in the three photon samples .",
    "since the width of @xmath29 is small the quality of the measurement is entirely determined by the energy resolution of the detector .",
    "the left plot in figure [ fig : mass0 ] shows the invariant mass distribution of photon pairs from signal and background events for @xmath79 and a luminosity of @xmath57 , corresponding to 59 signal and 11 background events .",
    "[ fig : mass0 ]    a sharp peak around @xmath80 is clearly visible on top of the standard model background and combinatoric background from the signal .    measuring the mass of the charged @xmath66 is more difficult since it decays into @xmath81 .",
    "decays of the @xmath54 boson into electrons or muons , either directly or via taus that decay leptonically , occur in about @xmath82 of all cases and lead to a @xmath83 signal that is essentially free of backgrounds .",
    "we also include the taus from hadronic decays that are reconstructed by pgs .",
    "a fraction of the @xmath54 boson momentum is carried away by one or several neutrinos .",
    "since neutrinos are the only physical source of missing energy and they are essentially massless , the @xmath66 mass can be determined accurately from the transverse mass @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the invariant mass of the lepton - photon system , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 denotes the transverse momentum of the indicated particle set . to obtain the transverse mass distribution we identify the photon pair from the @xmath29 decay by the requirement that @xmath89 agrees with @xmath90 within 5% , and then combine the remaining photon with the lepton , which we require to have @xmath91 .",
    "we further require that @xmath92 to reduce the background from misidentified leptons .",
    "events where no photon pair can be identified uniquely by the @xmath89 window condition are discarded .",
    "the resulting transverse mass distribution is shown in figure [ fig : mass0 ] .",
    "for this analysis we use a sample with 200 signal events corresponding to @xmath93 , whereof 43 events satisfy our cuts . in spite of",
    "the small number of events the endpoint of the @xmath94 distribution near @xmath95 is clearly visible .",
    "theoretically one would expect a sharp cutoff at the endpoint , which however is washed out due to detector smearing , in particular the mis - measurement of the missing transverse momentum",
    ".      some information about the spin of the resonance can already be extracted from the nature of the final state .",
    "a two - photon resonance can originate only from a spin - zero of spin - two particle [ we do not consider spins larger than two ] .    to distinguish further between the spin - zero and spin - two cases , one has to resort to angular distributions involving the final - state photons .",
    "an observable that is sensitive to the spin of @xmath96 is the distribution with respect to the angle @xmath97 between the production plane and decay plane of @xmath96 .",
    "once the mass of the resonance has been measured , this angle can be constructed from the momenta of the two photons that reconstruct the resonance together with the beam axis .",
    "assuming an unpolarized initial state a nontrivial distribution can only arise from interference between different helicity states and would therefore rule out a spin - zero interpretation of the signal @xcite .",
    "the distribution of @xmath97 in a sample of 10,000 @xmath50 events with @xmath98 is shown in figure [ fig : phidist ] .",
    "while one would expect this distribution to be completely flat , some angular dependence is introduced by the selection cuts , which explains the lower counting rates around @xmath99 and @xmath100 . for comparison",
    ", we show the same distribution for a kk - graviton @xmath101 decaying into two photons in the process @xmath102 , with @xmath103 .",
    "this distribution was produced using an implementation of massive spin - two particles into madgraph / madevent @xcite .    to estimate how well the two cases can be distinguished with a realistic number of 600 events ( corresponding to 300  fb@xmath0 integrated luminosity ) , we calculate the ratio of the number of events in the interval @xmath104 divided by the number of events lying outside of this interval . for the case of the pseudoscalar resonance @xmath96",
    "we obtain @xmath105 whereas we get @xmath106 for the graviton resonance .",
    "the central value and errors have been obtained by randomly picking 600 events from the full samples multiple times and extracting the mean and standard deviation .",
    "it is therefore possible to distinguish the two cases considered here at the three sigma level .",
    "[ fig : phidist ]    one drawback of this method however is that the angular distribution depends on the production process and can be quite different even for similar processes , for example when comparing the production of @xmath107 to @xmath108 production .",
    "it is therefore not possible to conclusively exclude a nonzero spin of @xmath96 just using this observable , or in other words , just using the three - photon final state .",
    "an alternative spin determination method was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the analysis of associated kk - graviton ",
    "photon production with the graviton decaying into a photon pair .",
    "they find that the angular distribution of one photon from this pair in the rest frame of the decaying graviton is sensitive to the graviton spin , but again the details of this distribution also depend on the production process .    a more reliable measurement of the @xmath96 spin that is independent of the production channel can be obtained by looking at different decay channels .",
    "one promising channel is the decay @xmath109 with a subsequent decay of the @xmath25 boson into charged leptons .",
    "the @xmath109 branching fraction is about 30% over most of the relevant parameter space .",
    "the angle @xmath110 between the photon and either of the leptons is sensitive to the polarization orientation of the @xmath25 boson and thus to the spin of the parent particle . for a pseudoscalar resonance decaying through the interaction ( [ eq : wzw ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath111 for comparison , the @xmath110 dependence for the decay of a spin - two kaluza - klein graviton , @xmath112 @xcite , is @xmath113 which is clearly distinguishable from the spin-0 case .",
    "the normalized angular distributions for the spin - zero case and for the spin - two case with @xmath114 and @xmath115 are shown in figure [ fig : zll ] .",
    "[ fig : zll ]    for completeness , we point out that a heavy vector boson @xmath116 can also decay to the @xmath117 final state through an anomaly interaction @xcite , all the while the @xmath118 channel is forbidden for a spin - one particle .",
    "the resulting @xmath110 distribution is given by @xmath119 +      { \\cal o}(m_z^4/m_{z'}^2 ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 are @xmath121 constants which depend on the details of the chern - simons and wess - zumino - witten terms that mediate the decay .",
    "for @xmath122 , this distribution peaks at @xmath123 , similar to the kk - graviton case , and thus can be clearly distinguished from a spin - zero parent particle . for @xmath124 , however , the @xmath110 dependence of the @xmath116 vector boson could look similar to the spin-0 or the spin-2 case , depending on the values of @xmath120 .",
    "however , as mentioned above , a distinction is always possible by observing the @xmath118 decay mode , which is forbidden for a vector boson .",
    "the cp properties of the scalar resonance can not be determined from the @xmath125 channel , since a parity - even scalar that decays through the effective coupling @xmath126 displays the same @xmath127 behavior as the pseudoscalar .",
    "full information about the particle properties can be obtained from the so called golden channel decay @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 denotes charged leptons , in particular electrons and muons .",
    "detailed studies on how to extract spin information using these channels have been recently performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which show that a small number of events ( 2030 ) is enough to obtain a @xmath130 discrimination between different spin and parity hypotheses . due to the small branching fraction of the @xmath25 boson into leptons this channel can only be used for spin determination if the @xmath16 are light , below @xmath131 , even for the full lhc design luminosity of 300  fb@xmath0 .",
    "an important feature of the anomaly - mediated decays of the scalar triplet is that the branching fractions of @xmath29 and @xmath132 are completely fixed by the global symmetry structure .",
    "if these particles are found in the multi - photon channel the next task will be to look for the possible decays of @xmath29 into @xmath125 and @xmath133 pairs as well as for the @xmath134 decay mode of the @xmath66 .",
    "the measured branching fractions will then unambiguously determine whether the decays are mediated by the wzw term and thus reveal information about the symmetry structure of the model .",
    "if the mass splitting between the charged and neutral components can be measured , for example indirectly by observing the @xmath135 decay modes , more information can be obtained .",
    "since the splitting is purely due to radiative corrections , a mass splitting larger than the one generated by standard model gauge interactions , see eq .  ,",
    "hints towards the existence of additional global symmetry breaking operators , @xmath136 additional gauge bosons or new fermions , as in the case of little higgs models .",
    "in this paper we discuss multi - photon signals from pseudoscalar electroweak triplets @xmath137 and the prospects for the lhc to detect them .",
    "these triplet fields appear in a general class of composite extensions of the standard model , in particular in little higgs models and in models where parts of the fermion sector transforms vector - like under the electroweak su(2 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the multi - photon signal is therefore an important channel for detection or exclusion of these models .    in these models ,",
    "the leading - order effective lagrangian for the pseudoscalars is symmetric under some parity , so that their decays are only induced loop - level wess - zumino - witten terms that lead to anomalous breaking of the parity . as a result ,",
    "the decay channels and branching fractions are fully determined by the global symmetry structure .",
    "in particular we find that the neutral component has a large branching fraction into photon pairs even for masses well above the @xmath133 threshold . due to the parity symmetry , at the lhc",
    "the triplets are mostly produced in pairs , with a sizable cross section for masses up to @xmath138 .",
    "the two major sources of backgrounds for @xmath50 signals at the lhc are direct three photon production an @xmath139 production where one of the jets is misidentified as a photon .",
    "we generated monte - carlo events with matrix - element matching and used the fast detector simulation pgs4 to estimate the backgrounds and in particular the photon fake rate . and to account for detector efficiencies and energy smearing .",
    "we find that the background can be reduced significantly with a set of simple cuts , so that a @xmath65 discovery is possible at the 14 tev lhc with @xmath140 for pseudoscalar masses up to about 500  gev . for the current 7 tev run of the lhc",
    "a discovery is still possible if the @xmath16 are lighter than 250  gev .",
    "since this signal relies only on a clean signature involving photons , and possibly leptons from @xmath54-boson decays , we expect that the masses of the neutral @xmath96 and charged @xmath132 can be measured with high accuracy from the di - photon invariant mass peak and the kinematic endpoint of the lepton - photon invariant mass distribution , respectively . in principle",
    ", the spin of the neutral pseudoscalar @xmath96 can be determined from the angular distribution of the two - photon final state but , depending on the mass of @xmath96 , the spin effect can be quite small and difficult to measure experimentally .",
    "other decay modes of the triplets , in particular into @xmath133 or @xmath141 final states , offer additional possibilities to obtain information about the nature of the observed particles .",
    "we have shown that the decay of @xmath96 into @xmath141 followed by the leptonic decay of the @xmath25 boson can be used to distinguish it from a resonance with spin two , and possibly also spin one . in the @xmath133 channel , the fully leptonic decay of both @xmath25 bosons can be used to uniquely determine the spin and the parity of the @xmath96 .",
    "the branching fractions for the different channels yield information about the global symmetry structure of the model .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that the current limit for the @xmath142 signal from the d  experiment at the tevatron was obtained with only @xmath143 of data , and translates into a bound of @xmath144 for our model .",
