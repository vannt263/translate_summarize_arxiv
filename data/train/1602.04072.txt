    "over the last few years , research of mechanical systems coupled to quantum two - level systems has attracted great deal of experimental and theoretical interest @xcite . micro- and nano - mechanical oscillators can respond to very weak electric , magnetic and optical forces , which allows one to use them as highly sensitive force detectors @xcite . for example",
    ", the cantilever with attonewton ( @xmath3 n ) force sensitivity can be used to test the violation of newtonian gravity at sub - millimeter length scale @xcite . with current quantum technologies coupling between a nanomechanical oscillator and a single spin can be achieved experimentally by using strong magnetic - field gradient .",
    "such a coupling paves the way for sensing the magnetic force associated with the single electron spin @xcite . to this end",
    ", a recent experiment demonstrated that the coherent evolution of the electronic spin of an individual nitrogen vacancy center can be used to detect the vibration of a magnetized mechanical resonator @xcite .",
    "another promising quantum platform with application in high - precision sensing is the system of laser - cooled trapped ions , which allows excellent control over the internal and motional degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "force sensitivity of order of 170 yn @xmath4 ( @xmath5 n ) was reported recently with an ensemble of ions in a penning trap @xcite .",
    "force measurement down to @xmath6 yn has been demonstrated experimentally using the injection - locking technique with a single trapped ion @xcite .",
    "moreover , force detection with sensitivity in the range of 1 yn @xmath4 is possible for single - ion experiments based on the measurement of the ion s displacement amplitude @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose ion - based sensing schemes for measuring very rapidly varying forces , which follow an earlier proposal @xcite wherein the relevant force information is mapped into the spin degrees of freedom of the single trapped ion .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , the techniques proposed here do not require specific adiabatic evolution of the control parameters but rather they rely on using ramsey - type oscillations of the ion s spin states , which are detected via state - dependent fluorescence measurements .",
    "moreover , we show that by using dynamical decoupling schemes , the sensing protocols become robust against dephasing of the spin states caused by thermal and magnetic - field fluctuations .",

    "can be suppressed such that the sensing protocol does not require initial ground - state cooling of the ion s vibrational state .",
    "we show that the axial force sensing can be implemented also by using a probe represented by the quantum rabi ( qr ) model . because of the absence of residual spin - motional coupling in this case , the force estimation is robust to spin dephasing induced by the thermal motion fluctuations .    furthermore , we introduce a sensing scheme capable to extract the two - dimensional map of the applied force . here the quantum probe is represented by the jahn - teller ( jt ) model , in which the spin states are coupled with phonons in two spatial directions .",
    "we show that the two transverse components of the force can be measured by observing simply the coherent evolution of the spin states . in order to protect the spin coherence during the force estimation",

    "we estimate the optimal force sensitivity in the presence of motional heating and find that with current ion trap technologies force sensitivity better than 1 yn @xmath4 can be achieved .",
