    "lie groups and lie algebras are related to symmetries of systems . by the use of the symmetry",
    "the system can be better understood , maybe it is even possible to solve it in a certain sense . here",
    "we deal with systems which have an infinite number of independent degrees of freedom .",
    "they appear for example in conformal field theory ( cft ) , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but also in the theory of partial differential equations and at many other places in- and outside of mathematics they play an important role . the appearing lie groups and lie algebras are infinite dimensional .",
    "some of the simplest nontrivial infinite dimensional lie algebras are the witt algebra and its central extension the virasoro algebra .",
    "we will recall their definitions in section  [ sec : vir ] . in the sense explained ( in particular in cft ) they are related to what is called the genus zero situation .",
    "for cft on arbitrary genus riemann surfaces the krichever - novikov ( kn ) type algebras , to be discussed here , will show up as algebras of global symmetry operators .",
    "these algebras are defined via meromorphic objects on compact riemann surfaces @xmath0 of arbitrary genus with controlled polar behaviour .",
    "more precisely , poles are only allowed at a fixed finite set of points denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the `` classical '' examples are the algebras defined by objects on the riemann sphere ( genus zero ) with possible poles only at @xmath2 .",
    "this yields e.g. the witt algebra , the classical current algebras , including their central extensions the virasoro , and the affine kac - moody algebras @xcite . for higher genus , but still only for two points where poles are allowed , they were generalised by krichever and novikov @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in 1987 . in 1990",
    "the author @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite extended the approach further to the general multi - point case .",
    "this extension was not a straight - forward generalization .",
    "the crucial point is to introduce a replacement of the graded algebra structure present in the `` classical '' case .",
    "krichever and novikov found that an almost - grading , see definition  [ d : almgrad ] below , will be enough to do the usual constructions in representation theory , like triangular decompositions , highest weight modules , verma modules which are demanded by the applications . in @xcite , @xcite it was realized that a splitting of @xmath1 into two disjoint non - empty subsets @xmath3 is crucial for introducing an almost - grading and the corresponding almost - grading was given .",
    "in the two - point situation there is only one such splitting ( up to inversion ) hence there is only one almost - grading , which in the classical case is a honest grading .",
    "similar to the classical situation a krichever - novikov algebra , should always be considered as an algebra of meromorphic objects with an almost - grading coming from such a fixed splitting .",
    "i like to point out that already in the genus zero case ( i.e. the riemann sphere case ) with more than two points where poles are allowed the algebras will only be almost - graded .",
    "in fact , quite a number of interesting new phenomena will show up already there , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this review",
    "no proofs are supplied . for them",
    "i have to refer to the original articles and/or to the forthcoming book @xcite .",
    "for some applications jointly obtained with oleg sheinman , see also @xcite . for more on the witt and virasoro algebra",
    "see for example the book @xcite .",
    "after recalling the definition of the witt and virasoro algebra in section  [ sec : vir ] we start with describing the geometric set - up of krichever - novikov ( kn ) type algebras in section  [ sec : algebra ] .",
    "we introduce a poisson algebra structure on the space of meromorphic forms ( holomorphic outside of the fixed set @xmath1 of points where poles are allowed ) of all weights ( integer and half - integer ) .",
    "special substructures will yield the function algebra , the vector field algebra and more generally the differential operator algebra .",
    "moreover , we discuss also the lie superalgebras of kn type defined via forms of weight -1/2 .",
    "an important example role also is played by the current algebra ( arbitrary genus - multi - point ) associated to a finite - dimensional lie algebra .    in section  [ sec : almgrad ] we introduce the almost - grading induced by the splitting of @xmath1 into `` incoming '' and `` outgoing '' points , @xmath3 .    in section  [ sec",
    ": centvec ] we discuss central extensions for our algebras .",
    "central extensions appear naturally in the context of quantization and regularization of actions .",
    "we give for all our algebras geometrically defined central extensions .",
    "the defining cocycle for the virasoro algebra obviously does not make any sense in the higher genus and/or multi - point case .",
    "for the geometric description we use projective and affine connections .",
    "in contrast to the classical case there are a many inequivalent cocycles and central extensions . if we restrict our attention to the cases where we can extend the almost - grading to the central extensions the author obtained complete classification and uniqueness results .",
    "they are described in section  [ sec : class ] .    in section  [ sec : fr ] we present further results . in particular , we discuss how from the representation of the vector field algebra ( or more general of the differential operator algebra ) on the forms of weight @xmath4 one obtains semi - infinite wedge representations ( fermionic fock space representations ) of the centrally extended algebras .",
    "these representations have ground states ( vacua ) , creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we add some words about @xmath5 systems , sugawara construction , wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wznw ) models , knizhnik - zamolodchikov ( kz ) connections , and deformations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "recently , a new class of current type algebras the lax operator algebras , were introduced by krichever and sheinman @xcite , @xcite .",
    "i will report on them in section  [ sec : lax ] .    in the closing section  [ sec : hist ]",

    "in fact it will be @xmath344+\\frac { 2{\\lambda}-1}{2}[\\psi^4_{c_s}]-[\\psi^1_{c_s } ] , \\qquad c_{\\lambda}:=-2(6{\\lambda}^2 - 6{\\lambda}+1).\\ ] ] recall that @xmath345 is the cocycle for the vector field algebra , @xmath346 the cocycle for the function algebra , and @xmath347 the mixing cocycle , see @xcite for details .",
    "note that the expression for @xmath348 appears also in mumford s formula @xcite relating divisors on the moduli space of curves .",
    "also the representation on @xmath331 gives a projective representation of the algebra of @xmath349 of differential operators of all orders .",
    "it is exactly the combination ( [ eq : dhl ] ) which lifts to a cocycle for @xmath349 and gives a central extension @xmath350 . for @xmath109 we could rescale the central element .",
    "hence the central extension @xmath351 did not depend essentially on the weight . here",
    "this is different .",
    "the central extension @xmath352 depends on it .    for the centrally extended current algebras",
    "@xmath353 , the affine algebra of kn type , in a similar way fermionic fock space representations can be constructed , see @xcite , @xcite .      related to the above",
    "there are other quantum algebra systems which can be realized on @xmath331 . on the space @xmath331 the forms @xmath101 act by wedging elements @xmath355 in front of the semi - infinite wedge form , i.e. @xmath356 using the krichever - novikov duality pairing ( [ eq : kndual ] ) to contract in the semi - infinite wedge form the entries with the form @xmath357 the latter form will act @xmath331 . for @xmath334 a basis element ( [ eq : sform ] ) of @xmath331",
    "the contraction is defines via @xmath358 here @xmath359 indicates as usual that this element will not be there anymore .",
    "both operations together create a clifford algebra structure , which is sometimes called a @xmath360 system , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .      given an admissible representation of the centrally extended current algebra @xmath353 we can construct the so called _",

    "the sugawara operator is an infinite formal sum of operators and is constructed as the product of the current operators which are again formal infinite sum of operators . to make the product well - defined a normal",

    "it turns out that after some rescaling the operators appearing in the formal sum of the sugawara operators give a representation of a centrally extended vector field algebra @xmath109 .",
    "the central extension is due to the appearance of the normal ordering .",
    "again the defining cocycle is local and we know that the central extension defined by the representation is the central extension given by our geometric cocycle @xmath362 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for details .",
    "despite the fact , that it is a very important application , the following description is extremely condensed .",

    "the requirements ( [ eq : gldef ] ) are independent of the chosen coordinates @xmath383 .",
    "it is not at all clear that the commutator of two such matrix functions fulfills again these conditions .",

    "* the only additional condition is that in ( [ eq : glexp ] ) all matrices @xmath396 are trace - less .",
    "the conditions ( [ eq : gldef ] ) remain unchanged .    in the case of * @xmath368 * one requires that all @xmath396 in ( [ eq : glexp ] ) are skew - symmetric . in particular , they are trace - less .",
    "following @xcite the set - up has to be slightly modified .",
    "first only those tyurin parameters @xmath397 are allowed which satisfy @xmath398",
    ". then the 1 .",

    "the lie algebra @xmath369 is the lie algebra of matrices @xmath403 such that @xmath404 .",
    "the condition @xmath405 will be automatic . at the weak singularities we have the expansion @xmath406 the condition ( [ eq : gldef ] )",
    "is modified as follows ( see @xcite ) : there exist @xmath407 , @xmath408 such that @xmath409 moreover , we require @xmath410 again under the point - wise matrix commutator the set of such maps constitute a lie algebra .    the next step is to introduce an almost - graded structure for these lax operator algebras induced by a splitting of the set @xmath3 .",

    "for @xmath366 we obtain two independent local cocycle classes if we assume @xmath109-invariance on the reductive part .",
    "in this section i will give some historical remarks ( also on related works ) on krichever - novikov type algebras .",
    "space limitations do not allow to give a complete list of references .",

    "@xcite , @xcite in the two - point case initiated the subject .",
    "they introduced the vector field algebra , the function algebra and the affine algebra with their almost - graded structure . to acknowledge their work these algebras",
    "are nowadays called krichever - novikov ( kn ) type algebras . sheinman joint in by investigating the affine algebras and their representations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    as it should have become clear from this review what should be called a kn type algebra",
    "is not the algebra alone but the algebra together with a chosen almost - grading .",
    "it is exactly the step of introducing such an almost - grading which is not straightforward .    from the application in cft , string theory , etc .",
    "there was clearly the need to pass over to a multi - point picture . in the multi - point case",
    "this was done 1989 by the author in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the almost - grading is induced by splitting of the set @xmath1 of points where poles are allowed into two non - empty disjoint subsets @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the applications quite often",
    "such a splitting is naturally given . in the context of fields and strings",
    "the points correspond to incoming and outgoing fields and strings respectively . without considering an almost - grading dick",
    "@xcite gave also a generalization of the vector field algebra .",
    "he obtained results similar to @xcite . only in the work of sadov @xcite 1990 an almost - grading",
    "is also discussed .",
    "note that in the two - point case there is only one splitting .",
    "hence , quite often one does not mention explicitely the grading for the witt and virasoro algebra , respectively the almost - grading for the kn type algebras .",
    "nevertheless , the grading is heavily used .",
    "the genus zero and two - point case is the classical well - studied case .",
    "but already for genus zero and more than two points there are interesting things so study , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for genus one ,",
    "the complex torus case , there is @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after the work of krichever and novikov appeared physicists got very much interested in these algebras and the possibilities of using these objects for a global operator approach .",
    "especially i like to mention the work of the people around bonora @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "this includes also the superversions .",
    "a lot of more names could be given .",
    "it is not only the possible applications in physics which makes the kn type algebras so interesting . from the mathematical point",
    "general infinite dimensional lie algebras are hard to approach .",
    "kn type algebras supply examples of them which are given in a geometrical context , hence ( hopefully ) better to understand .",
    "a typical example of this are the families of geometric deformation of the witt algebra which i mentioned in section  [ sec : geodef ] obtained by degenerations of tori .",
    "quite recently also in the context of jordan superalgebras and lie antialgebras @xcite examples were constructed on the basis of kn type algebras @xcite , @xcite , @xcite    in this review we discussed extensively the case of 2nd lie algebra cohomology with values in the trivial module .",
