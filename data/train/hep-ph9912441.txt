    "in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes observed at hera , a lepton @xmath5 of 27.5 gev interacts with a proton @xmath6 of 920 gev yielding a lepton @xmath7 and a set of hadrons @xmath8 in the final state .",
    "following the nature of @xmath7 the interaction proceeds via a neutral ( @xmath9 ) current ( nc ) or a charged ( @xmath10 ) current ( cc ) .",
    "dis events are collected in the h1 and zeus experiments @xcite which are located at the two @xmath11 interaction points of hera .",
    "the kinematics of the dis inclusive processes , @xmath12 , is determined by two independent kinematic variables , besides the energy of the incoming lepton and proton .",
    "one usually chooses them among the four lorentz invariants @xmath13 whereby at hera one can neglect the lepton and proton masses so that the useful relation @xmath14 holds .",
    "these kinematic variables are obtained experimentally by measuring the momentum and/or the hadronic energy , the direction of the scattered lepton and/or the hadronic energy flow .    in this report",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the cross - section measurements at hera in the medium 1.5 gev@xmath15 gev@xmath4 and high 150 gev@xmath16 gev@xmath4 domain of the dis regime . during the past",
    ", a large number of precise measurements have been performed in the medium @xmath3 region by fixed target experiments @xcite . with hera , three major improvements may be noticed :    * an extension of the 2 domain to very high @xmath3 ( @xmath17 2 ) but also to very small @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ; * an almost hermetic ( @xmath20 ) detection of the final state leading not only to the determination of the energy and angle of the scattered lepton but also of the produced hadrons ; * from the previous items it follows that the detection of both nc and cc is feasible in the same detector and during the same data taking period ;    the somewhat arbitrary distinction between low and high @xmath3 is related to different physics interests . in both regions perturbative quantum - chromo - dynamics ( pqcd ) is expected to describe the hera data @xcite .",
    "the pqcd analysis of medium 2 data is part of a long tradition @xcite from which the parton distributions of the nucleon and the strong coupling constant @xmath21 have been extracted . on the top of that ,",
    "very high 2 ( @xmath22 ) nc and cc data open a field of research in electroweak physics up to now reserved , in dis , to neutrino beam experiments .",
    "the rest of this report is organized as follows . in section [ section_un ] the measurements of nc and",
    "cc differential cross - sections are described .",
    "section [ section_deux ] is devoted to a phenomenological analysis of these measurements .",
    "neutral current events , at medium and high 2 , are basically identified by the presence of an electron ( or a positron ) in the final state .",
    "this is done by using tracking and calorimetric devices covering the range @xmath23 and @xmath244 gev(at hera the forward direction @xmath25 corresponds to the direction of the incoming proton ) .",
    "the differential cross - section measurement is done by counting the number of events within a kinematic interval in , say @xmath18 and 2 .",
    "therefore one of the experimental problems is to achieve a good reconstruction of these kinematic variables from the detector information .",
    "both , h1 and zeus , can use the outgoing lepton and hadronic final state information , namely the polar angles , the momenta and the deposited energies .",
    "it is then possible to define the kinematics of each event by using different ( and independent ) combinations of experimental information .    in zeus",
    "the double angle method is used @xmath26 the hadronic polar angle @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the energy and longitudinal momentum of the final state hadron @xmath31 and where @xmath32 is the total transverse momentum of the hadronic final state particles . in h1 , the electron method is used @xmath33 to determine 2 and @xmath18 only at @xmath34 since @xmath35 while at @xmath36 the @xmath37 method is used @xmath38 the reason for the differences between the methods used by h1 and zeus are related to the calorimeter performances : h1 possesses finely segmented electro - magnetic calorimeters and zeus a very good hadronic calorimetry .",
    "the redundancy in the determination of the kinematic variables is a crucial point and presents many advantages : minimization of the migration between the ` true ' and the measured kinematic variable by choosing one particular method ; cross calibration of the various calorimeter devices , and studies of photon radiation from the lepton line by comparing leptonic and hadronic information .",
    "once the collected events are gathered in @xmath18 - 2 bins , besides the subtraction of photoproduction background , correction factors are applied for : the efficiency of the event selection ; detector acceptance ; wrong reconstruction of the kinematics due to detector effects , and the contribution of higher order electroweak processes .",
    "when possible , these correction factors are determined and/or cross checked from the data themselves . if this is not possible , then they are determined from a full simulation of the dis and background processes including the detector response .    for the medium 2 data we shall describe the preliminary results of the high statistics 1997 data ( more than 10000 events per @xmath18 - 2 bin for h1 ) . for high 2 , the combined 1994 - 1997(@xmath39 beam ) data published in ref .",
    "@xcite are presented .    at medium 2 and for the h1 measurements , the main systematic uncertainties are : the electron energy scale ( @xmath40 ) , the hadronic energy scale ( @xmath41 ) , the electron polar angle(@xmath42 mrad ) , the photoproduction background at high-@xmath43 only ( @xmath44 effect on the measurements ) and the correction factors ( see above ) applied to the data ( each one is of the order of 1 - 2@xmath45 ) .",
    "the overall data normalization ( including the luminosity measurement ) uncertainty is 1.5 @xmath45 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is , in total , of the order of 3@xmath45 and is larger than the statistical uncertainties which are at the level of 1 @xmath45 for 2@xmath46 2 .    at high",
    "2 the systematic uncertainties are essentially the same . in zeus the statistic and systematic uncertainties amount to 3 - 5@xmath45 for the kinematic range @xmath47 2 @xmath48 2 considered in the analysis .    in charged current events ,",
    "the outgoing neutrino escapes the detection .",
    "such events are then characterized by missing transverse energy @xmath49 .",
    "analyses in zeus ( h1 ) have demanded @xmath50 gev ( @xmath51 gev ) .",
    "for the reconstruction of the kinematic variables , one can only use information from the hadronic final state , i.e. the jacquet - blondel method , giving , @xmath52 the cc events statistics is still low , @xmath53 900 events for @xmath54 2 in zeus .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is dominated by the hadronic energy scale , which induces an effect of the order of 10@xmath45 , except at very high 2 and very high @xmath18 where the effect is above @xmath55 .",
    "other systematic sources related to the @xmath49 cut , acceptance correction and photoproduction background subtraction ( in the lowest 2 bins ) lead to measurement uncertainties between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we shall distinguish the phenomenological analysis of the medium 2 data from the high 2 data .",
    "as we are interested in the hera data , it should be noted that we are considering the region of large @xmath58 2 .",
    "therefore , we will not be concerned by the non - perturbative effects and the higher twist effects appearing in this region so that the symbol pqcd , appearing below , refers to the leading twist of pqcd .",
    "for all the mathematical details which can not be given here we refer to ref . @xcite and references therein .      in the one boson exchange approximation , the nc differential cross - section reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the nucleon structure functions are modelled using the quark - parton model and pqcd . in the so called naive parton model one",
    "writes @xmath61\\,,\\ , f_3(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n_f}b_i(q^2)[q_i(x)-\\bar{q}_i(x)]\\ ] ] where @xmath62 ( @xmath63)is the density function of the quark ( anti - quark ) of flavor @xmath31 , @xmath64 is the number of active flavors and @xmath65 .",
    "the functions @xmath66 @xcite depend on the electric charge @xmath67 ( @xmath68 for 2@xmath69 ) and embody the effects of the @xmath70 exchange and @xmath71 interference in their 2 dependence .",
    "the same holds for the functions @xmath72 @xcite except that they vanish at 2@xmath69 .    going beyond the simple parton model ,",
    "higher order contributions in @xmath21 are taken into account .",
    "however mass singularities appear in the initial state of dis processes and can not be regularised without resuming the whole perturbative series .",
    "this resumation is done in a restricted kinematic region where @xmath73 is large @xcite .",
    "this latter region is defined by2@xmath74 gev@xmath4 , and the pcdq calculations are safe for 2 above a few gev@xmath4 . in this domain ,",
    "the parton density functions ( pdf ) are given by the solution of the dglap equations @xcite :    @xmath75    with @xmath76 and where @xmath77 is the singlet quark density , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the two non singlet densities and @xmath80 is the gluon density .",
    "the splitting functions @xmath81 describe the branching of parton @xmath82 from parton @xmath31 , and they can be computed with pqcd up to the second order . in eq .",
    "( [ ap1 ] ) @xmath83 is the factorization scale ( below which the mass singularity is resumed ) and @xmath84 is the renormalisation scale ( related to the ultra - violet singularity ) . as the two scales must be chosen somehow , a natural choice for @xmath83 is @xmath85 , i.e. the virtual mass of the probe",
    ". we shall , as usual , also set @xmath86 for convenience .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the dglap equations are universal , i.e. that they are independent of the specific hard process .",
    "( [ ap1 ] ) embodies the mass singularity resumation and therefore it only describes the so called light parton , i.e. the parton of flavour @xmath31 and mass @xmath87 such that @xmath88 . in the medium 2 range one",
    "can take the gluon , the up , down and strange quarks as the light partons .",
    "for the heavy quarks ( charm and beauty ) one needs to specify a special scheme .",
    "we have chosen the fixed - flavor - scheme ( ffs ) @xcite  suitable in the hera medium 2 range  where beauty is neglected , and where the charm contribution is computed from the boson - gluon - fusion process @xmath89 plus the @xmath90 corrections . in this scheme charm",
    "is produced ` outside ' the hadron .",
    "the relation between the pdfs and the structure functions depends on the renormalisation scheme . in next - to - leading - log - approximation ( nlla ) and in the @xmath91 scheme one",
    "obtains : @xmath92 + f_i^{c\\bar{c}}(x , q^2)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath93 and where @xmath94 ( there is a similar expression for @xmath95 with @xmath96 ) ; @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the coefficient functions depending on the hard process ; @xmath99 is the charm contribution @xcite .",
    "it suffices here to say that it depends on @xmath100 and on a renormalisation scale that we choose to be @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath102 in the nnla .    to solve the system of integro - differential equations ( [ ap1 ] )",
    ", one must provide some initial conditions , i.e. some input functions of @xmath18 at a given 2 for each pdf . since these functions reflect some unknown non - perturbative mechanism , one must parameterize with the help of a set of parameters .",
    "as we shall see below , these parameters are determined by comparing the calculations to the experimental data .",
    "however , the inclusive dis data alone can not constrain all light flavours since the structures functions are linear combinations of the pdfs : introducing the singlet and a non - singlet @xmath103 densities in order to write @xmath104 = { 2}/{3}xu^++{1}/{9}x\\sigma$ ] .",
    "there is one important property of the dglap kernels @xmath105 : the average total momentum carried by the partons , @xmath106 , is independent of 2 .",
    "this quantity is called the momentum sum rule and is usually fixed to 1 .",
    "so in principle one may be able to describe the inclusive hera data by parameterizing the three functions @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "but we found that such a description is not adequate for the following reasons :    * it leads systematically to a too large fraction of the total momentum carried by the gluons @xmath110 , in contradiction with the results of global fits including specific constrain on @xmath107 at high @xmath18 @xcite ; * since the dglap equations involve some integrals of the pdfs from @xmath18 to 1 , one must also introduce some constraints at higher @xmath18 , i.e. the fixed target hydrogen data from nmc and bcdms @xcite ; * even when fixed target hydrogen data are included , one is unable to constrain the total momentum carried by the gluons .",
    "one must in addition include the fixed target deuterium data . in this case",
    "a second non - singlet density must be parameterized ( essentially @xmath111 ) , but now the valence counting rules , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , can be applied , under certain assumptions , in order to constrain the momentum sum rule at high @xmath18 .",
    "h1 and zeus have used the latter option but with different assumptions .",
    "we will describe here the fits performed to the 1994 data and to the preliminary 1997 data .",
    "both experiments include their own inclusive measurements and the nmc and bcdms data .    in h1 two assumptions",
    "are made : @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the first constraint is in contradiction with the global fit results @xcite including the drell - yann data but we have found that it does not modify significantly the gluon density at below @xmath116 .",
    "the second assumption comes from the results of the dimuon events of ccfr @xcite .",
    "finally @xmath107 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are parameterized at a given value of 2 using the mathematical function @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "the momentum sum - rule and the quark counting rules are applied so that there is 16 free parameters in the h1 fit .    in zeus ,",
    "the two valence quarks are taken from the mrs parameterization @xcite and @xmath122 is also applied .",
    "@xmath107 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are parameterized using the above mathematical functions .    concerning the data - theory comparison , from which the input pdfs have to be determined , both h1 and zeus use a @xmath125 minimization procedure .",
    "the main steps of the fitting procedure are summarized below . for each iteration : 1 ) the pdf s are parameterized at a given value of 2 denoted @xmath126 , it is chosen to be 7 2 in the zeus fit and 4 2 in the h1 fit , 2 ) the dglap equations are solved numerically in the @xmath18-space @xcite .",
    "3 ) the evolved pdf s are convoluted with the coefficient functions to obtain the structure functions . assuming that all experimental uncertainties are normally distributed a @xmath125 is computed",
