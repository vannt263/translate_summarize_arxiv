    "the open cluster ngc1513 is located in the perseus constellation .",
    "its equatorial and galactic coordinates are :    @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9 . + in the trmpler(1930 )",
    "catalogue it is classified as ii2 m a moderately rich cluster with little central concentration .",
    "it was investigated astrometrically by bronnikova(1958a ) who determined the proper motions ( pm ) using a single pair of plates with an epoch difference of 55 years .",
    "barhatova and drjahlushina(1960 ) published photographic and photovisual magnitudes of 49 stars from bronnikova s ( 1958b ) list .",
    "del rio and huestamendia(1988 ) ( rh ) obtained photoelectric @xmath10 magnitudes of 31 stars and photographic @xmath11 magnitudes for 116 stars in the cluster region .",
    "spectra and radial velocities of stars in this area have not been investigated . as the epoch difference has increased significantly since the time of the last and only attempt to investigate proper motions of the stars in the region of the open cluster ngc1513 we decided to study it using the material available at present .",
    "the observational material belongs to the normal astrograph collection of the pulkovo observatory and dates from 1899 to 2000 ( table   1 ) .",
    "the cluster region from the usno - a 2.0 catalogue was used as an additional plate ( epoch 1954.8 ) .",
    "the scale of the normal astrograph plates is @xmath12 .",
    "the positions of 383 stars in an area @xmath13 centered on the cluster ngc1513 were measured . for the first time",
    "our plates were scanned by means of the automated measuring complex `` fantasy '' . as there is no description of the complex in english we present it in the appendix .",

    "the details of the method are presented in the paper of jilinski et al.(2000 ) .",
    "the plate 5017 with the faintest images was used as the central plate .",
    "it was orientated using 64 stars in common with stars in the `` tycho '' catalogue stars so that the @xmath14-axis was parallel to the sky meridian .",
    "the reference stars for the reduction were selected by several approximations .",
    "each step consists of two successive parts . at the first step",
    "all the stars of the region were considered as reference stars . for each star graphs",
    "were considered where the epochs of the plates were plotted as abscissa and the coordinate @xmath15 or @xmath14 of the stars as ordinates .",
    "two straight lines were drawn by a least square fitting .",
    "their inclinations correspond to the proper motion components @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the star .",
    "after this preliminary determination of pm the first rough selection of cluster members was made .",
    "those of the stars that were located on the vector point diagram ( vpd ) in a circle with a radius of three standard deviation from the center of the concentration of points corresponding to the cluster were considered to be members of the cluster . as a result of the first approximation a new list of reference stars",
    "was compiled according to the generally accepted rule : that they must be uniformly distributed in the studied region excluding the cluster area , have small proper motions and belong to a chosen range of @xmath18 magnitudes .",
    "as the @xmath10 magnitude of only a few stars were determined in the investigated area we had to use the considerably less precise values of @xmath18 magnitudes of the usno - a 2.0 catalogue .",
    "thus 39 stars in the interval between @xmath19 and @xmath20 mag were selected .",
    "the linear method of reduction was used . from the second approximation the selection of cluster members was made according to sanders method(1971 ) assuming that the proper motion distributions of the cluster and field stars on the vpd were bivariate gaussian distributions , circular for the cluster @xmath21 and elliptical for the field @xmath22 .",
    "modelling of the resulting distribution was fulfilled by the method of maximum likelihood .",
    "the values of the parameters of the corresponding system of the non - linear equations were determined by computer iterations .",
    "all the formulas are given in jilinski et al(2000 ) .",
    "the individual membership probability of a star was determined by its position on vpd and calculated by the following formula :    @xmath23    @xmath24 - normalized number of cluster stars ,    @xmath25 - normalized number of field stars ,    @xmath26 , @xmath27 - proper motion in @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the @xmath30 star .    in order to have a fast fit in the solution of the system parameters close to the real initial values of parameters",
    "were adopted . in the final calculation of probabilities",
    "the following values were used : the relative number of cluster members and field stars @xmath31 ; + centers of the distributions on the vpd : + the field @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; the cluster @xmath34 , @xmath35 ; + standard deviations : the field @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; the cluster @xmath38 . + all the values are in @xmath39 . each iteration ended with plotting the histogram of probabilities .",
    "its analysis permitted an estimation of the minimal value of probability for a star to be considered a cluster member .",
    "the final histogram is shown in fig .  1",
    ".    [ t ]    the magnitude equation ( me ) or the dependence of the determined proper motions on star magnitudes was investigated at each step of the membership selection . during the first iteration",
    "the me was derived from an investigation of the vpd for assumed field stars with proper motion components corrected for the motion of the sun towards the solar apex .",
    "the values of these components were calculated with the help of the tables published by zhukov(1966 )",
    ". then me was estimated by the selected cluster members anew in each iteration .",
    "the direction and inclination of the me ( for @xmath15-axis : @xmath40 , for @xmath14-axis : @xmath41 ) were derived from the field stars in the whole interval of @xmath18 magnitudes from @xmath42 to @xmath43 mag .",
    "these values were used to correct those of the original catalogue .",
    "after the selection of cluster members the estimated me was : @xmath15 : @xmath44 , @xmath14 : @xmath45 .",
    "the final catalogue corrected according to these values appeared to be free of me within the limits of the accuracy of the determination of the pm of the stars .",
