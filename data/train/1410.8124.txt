    "detection of astrophysical neutrinos by the icecube collaboration @xcite has opened new era in the high energy astrophysics . reported excess of neutrinos at @xmath3 tev energies",
    "can be described by a power law @xmath4 with @xmath5 , and corresponds to the flux @xmath0 @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 for the sum of three flavors , possibly with cutoff at 3 pev  @xcite .",
    "this observation has high significance of 5.7 @xmath6 and calls for theoretical modeling and explanation .",
    "there are three main production mechanisms of high energy neutrinos .",
    "first , galactic cosmic rays produce neutrinos in the proton - proton ( proton - nuclei ) collisions in the interstellar gas in the disk of our milky way galaxy",
    ". such neutrinos would have energies from sub - gev up to pev , but can come only from directions close to the galactic plane .",
    "interestingly , 3-year icecube data do show some access in the direction of galactic plane with 2% chance probability  @xcite possibly exhibiting small scale anisotropy near galactic center .",
    "both signatures can be explained by the neutrino production in the galactic cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar gas . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that only at most 0.1 of the observed neutrino events in icecube can be described by cosmic ray interactions with matter inside milky way assuming local density of gas . however , expected signal is dominated by the flux from spiral arms and/or galactic bar , where supernova explosion rates , magnetic fields and density of interstellar gas are all much higher than those in the vicinity of the sun  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "neutrino flux detected by the icecube is consistent  @xcite with the power law extrapolation of @xmath7 gev diffuse gamma - ray flux from the galactic ridge , as observed by fermi telescope , which suggests common origin . as result , contribution of galaxy to neutrino flux",
    "can be much higher than 10 % .",
    "second , ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) interact with intergalactic radiation and produce secondary eev neutrinos in pion decays .",
    "the latter are called cosmogenic neutrinos and has been extensively studied theoretically since 1969  @xcite onwards ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "expected flux of cosmogenic neutrinos is somewhat model dependent , but even optimistic estimates are at least two orders of magnitude below icecube signal at pev energies .",
    "thus cosmogenic neutrinos are irrelevant in this energy range .",
    "finally , high energy neutrinos in a wide range of energies , from tev to 10 pev , can be produced in a variety of astrophysical sources in decays of charged pions created in the proton - photon or proton - proton collisions _ in situ_. various kinds of astrophysical sources of high energy neutrinos were considered prior to the icecube observation , including agn s @xcite , gamma - ray birst s @xcite , star burst galaxies @xcite .",
    "after icecube observation the interest to the problem has grown substantially . in a number of recent works  @xcite",
    "the attempt was made to explain icecube events by various astrophysical sources of high energy neutrino .    in this paper",
    "we are developing model originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where neutrinos arise in interactions of high energy cosmic rays accelerated in agn with photons from the big blue bump .",
    "as compared to previous papers developing this concept , we are attempting to explain the icecube observation using photopion production by cosmic rays on anisotropic radiation field produced by the realistic shakura - sunyaev model of accretion disks  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ss ]",
    "we present theoretical details of our calculation , reviewing also the observation knowledge about black hole accretion discs and their radiation fields . in section",
    "[ sec : obs ] we confront our numerical calculations with the icecube result and put constraints on the properties of such prospective neutrino sources .",
    "agn s are long sought potential sites for high energy neutrino production .",
    "they can accelerate protons up to highest energies and they are surrounded by high intensity radiation fields were photo - nuclear reactions with subsequent neutrino emission can occur . at the heart of an agn",
    "resides super - massive black hole surrounded by the accretion disc .",
    "accretion disc is hot and is emitting thermal radiation which gives prominent feature in the observed agn spectra usually refereed to as a `` big blue bump '' .",
    "accelerated particles move along two jets perpendicular to the accretion disc and crossing this radiation field .    in what follows we employ the following model for neutrino production .",
    "we assume that proton acceleration occurs directly near the black hole horizon , see e.g. refs .",
    "high energy neutrino appear in charged pion decays created in @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions in collisions with `` blue bump '' photons . as a first step we remind observational phenomenology of accretion discs and",
    "estimate optical depth for these photopion production reactions .",
    "the effective temperature of optically thick material on the scale of gravitational radius is given by  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is mass of a black hole and @xmath12 is the efficiency of converting gravitational potential energy to electromagnetic radiation , @xmath13 , at given accretion rate @xmath14 .",
    "eddington luminosity , @xmath15 , is defined as @xmath16    temperature has power low profile with radial coordinate on the disc , @xmath17 . in theory  @xcite @xmath18 .",
    "observationally , the slope is consistent with thin disc theory , @xmath19 , but would also allow a shallower temperature profile that would reduce the differences between the microlensing and flux size estimates  @xcite .    within uncertainties and with accuracy sufficient for our purposes ,",
    "the observed disc sizes at radiation frequency @xmath20  ev can be fitted by the relation  @xcite @xmath21 which is about two orders of magnitude larger as compared to the gravitational radius .",
    "this estimate is somewhat larger as compared to the expectation from thin disk theory .",
    "the photon density around the disc can be approximated by the relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is typical photon energy .",
    "on average , spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of agns are peaked at energy @xmath24 ev , for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the optical depth to photomeson production can be estimated as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is cross section at @xmath27-resonance .",
    "this gives @xmath28 irrespective of the black hole mass .",
    "there are tight correlations between monochromatic and bolometric luminosities of agn , e.g. @xmath29 , see @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 gives estimate for @xmath31 .",
    "for typical bolometric luminosity we can assume @xmath32 , see e.g. ref .",
    ". therefore @xmath33 would be typical value for the optical depth to photomeson production after traveling distance comparable to the accretion disc size .      in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the rate of reactions with the photon background is given by the standard expression , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the photon density in the laboratory frame , @xmath36 is the cross section of the relevant reaction in the rest frame of the primary particle as the function of the energy of the incident photon @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the gamma - factor of the primary particle in the laboratory frame .    for the black body radiation with temperature @xmath39 one",
    "has @xmath40 we assume that the disc segment at a radius @xmath41 radiates black body with local temperature @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_0 ] ) , and @xmath45 is given by  @xcite @xmath46 here @xmath47 is schwarzschild gravitational radius , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the radius of the disk inner edge .",
    "contribution of such segment to the photon density at point @xmath50 along disc axis is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the unit vector in the direction from @xmath41 to @xmath50 .",
    "its contribution to the reaction rate eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate - generic ] ) can be expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 finally @xmath55    the disk inner edge @xmath49 is related to the radiation efficiency as @xmath56 in what follows we use @xmath57 , which is usual assumption in existing literature .    optical depth with respect to this reaction for protons accelerated near black hole horizon and moving along jet axis from @xmath58 to infinity",
    "is given by @xmath59 .",
    "resulting function @xmath60 for photomeson production is shown in fig . 1 for several values of @xmath44   assuming temperature profile  ( [ eq : tprofile ] ) and radiation efficiency @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "to produce neutrinos with energy @xmath63 efficiently , one needs the optical depth with respect to this reaction to be larger than unity for protons with @xmath64 .",
    "this requirement translates to @xmath65 , see  fig .",
    "[ no_escape ] .",
    "( in ev).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this paper we do not study the processes of particle acceleration but simply assume that protons are accelerated by electric fields in close vicinity of the black hole horizon , for relevant models see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . for definiteness",
    "we assume that the spectrum of accelerated protons at @xmath66 has the power - law form @xmath67 their momenta are directed along the disk axes , and at larger @xmath50 electric fields and acceleration proceses are negligible . in what follows",
    "we choose @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the calculation of the observable neutrino spectrum is performed in two steps .",
    "first we simulate propagation of protons through the radiation field at @xmath70 and calculate resulting spectrum of nucleons and of products of their interaction . to be conservative",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is negligible and therefore both protons and neutrons with energies below the pion production threshold may freely escape the source .",
    "this will let us calculate the maximal possible contribution of the process to the observed spectrum of cosmic rays .",
    "as for the secondary electron - photon cascade calculation , to obtain it s upper bound we will always assume that the cascade freely escapes the source region and show below that even in this extreme case the predicted contribution of this process to the diffuse photon background would be far below the present observational upper limits .    we model interactions employing monte - carlo approach .",
    "in particular , during the @xmath71-th iteration at position @xmath72 the traveled optical depth @xmath73 is sampled using the equation @xmath74 here and below @xmath75 is uniformly distributed random variable , @xmath76 . the point of next interaction @xmath77",
    "is calculated by solving equation @xmath78 where @xmath79 is current gamma factor of the nucleon and @xmath80 is interaction rate given by eq.([eq : rate ] ) .",
    "the background photon momentum is sampled in each interaction point @xmath81 in the following way .",
    "firstly disk segment @xmath82 emitting the photon is sampled using eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) : @xmath83 then photon energy @xmath84 is sampled using eq .",
    "(  [ eq : rate - point ] ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "finally sophia event generator  @xcite is used to sample the recoiling nucleon energy @xmath87 as well as secondary particles and their momenta .",
    "the iterations continue while eq  ( [ eq : iteration ] ) has solution .",
    "absence of solution means that the nucleon freely escapes the agn site . as a result",
    "we obtain the spectrum of nucleons , neutrinos , photons and electrons leaving the interaction region .    in the second step",
    "we integrate over the distribution of sources taking into account their possible abundance evolution and cosmological propagation effects   and @xmath88 . ] .",
    "the latter mostly reduces to red shift , neutron decay , and electron - photon cascade development lead by interactions with cmb and intergalactic infrared background .",
    "this procedure is performed with the use of the numerical code developed in ref .",
    "the code simulates interactions of nucleons , photons and stable leptons with intergalactic photon backgrounds . for nucleons",
    "it takes into account photopion production , @xmath89-pair production and neutron decay .",
    "the secondary particles produced in these interactions are also traced in the code .",
    "the electron - photon cascade is mostly driven by the chain of inverse compton scattering of electrons on background photons and @xmath89-pair production by photons .",
    "we also take into account neutrino mixing using the mixing angles in the tribimaximal approximation , which is sufficient with current limited statistics .",
    "the resulting spectrum has a flavor ratio of approximately ( 1:1:1 ) .    finally , we normalize the simulated spectra using icecube data .",
    "namely , using 22 events with deposited energy above @xmath90 , published in ref .",
    "@xcite , and exposure dependence on energy from ref .",
    "@xcite , we maximize poisson probability of observing the above events provided that a given theoretical model is true .     power law injection spectrum and @xmath91 pev for disk temperature @xmath92 ev , black hole mass @xmath93 and luminosity evolution of sources @xmath94 .",
    "red points with errorbars represent the icecube astrophysical neutrino flux from ref.@xcite .",
    "atmospheric neutrino flux is taken from ref.@xcite , fermi diffuse gamma - ray flux is from ref .",
    "@xcite , while proton flux is from ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "power law spectrum and @xmath95 pev for @xmath96 ev and luminosity evolution of sources proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "experimental data are the same as in fig .",
    "[ example1 ] . ]    in the energy bin 0.4 - 1 pev the icecube does not have any events in present data .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite a gap larger than this one appears in 43% of realizations of the best fit continuous spectra .",
    "therefore , one may safely assume that the real neutrino spectrum is a smooth power law .",
    "on the other hand , different energy regions may correspond to different populations of sources , and , therefore , spectrum may have features .",
    "e.g. peak at @xmath97 might be real . at present",
    "one should consider both possibilities and we follow this line of thought in presenting results .    in the fig .",
    "[ example1 ] we present secondary neutrino flux ( shown in red ) from protons accelerated to @xmath91 pev and absorbed in the disk radiation field with temperature @xmath92 ev ( black hole mass @xmath93 and luminosity evolution of sources @xmath94 is assumed ) .",
    "we see that resulting neutrino spectrum is rather narrow   and therefore population of objects with such low temperature may explain narrow bumps in the spectrum .",
    "[ example2 ] corresponds to @xmath96 ev and @xmath95 pev . in this case",
    "all high energy part of the icecube neutrino flux at @xmath7 tev can be explained , assuming that the absence of events in the energy bin 0.5 - 1 pev is due to a statistical fluctuation .",
    "one would have to explain low energy data @xmath98 tev with other type of sources still , if such data will appear , since our model has low energy cutoff at 100 tev due to the energy threshold for photopion production .",
    "calculated secondary photon flux in all cases is significantly below diffuse @xmath38-background , measured by fermi .",
    "measured  @xcite proton flux at energies @xmath99 eev is dominated by galactic sources , see for example , ref .",
    "therefore , contribution of extragalactic sources to the observed proton flux should be sub - dominant .",
    "our results do not contradict to this observation as well .",
    "for @xmath100 power law injection spectrum , disk temperature @xmath101 ev and luminosity evolution of sources @xmath102 .",

    "the spectrum of neutrinos for @xmath92 ev is peaked at 1 - 3 pev and may be responsible for the high energy part of the icecube data .",
    "the case of high temperature @xmath96 ev can explain the icecube data for the whole energy range @xmath7 tev .",
    "in this paper we have made an attempt to explain the extragalactic neutrino signal recently announced by the icecube collaboration  @xcite .",
    "as prospective class of neutrino sources we have chosen agns . to model neutrino creation we study photopion production processes on the radiation field of the shakura - sunyaev accretion disks in the black hole vicinity . to our knowledge",
    "our work is the first one where the realistic anisotropic radiation field of the accretion disc was considered for these purposes .",
    "important parameters describing the model are maximum energy of accelerated protons and disk temperature .",
