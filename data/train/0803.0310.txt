    "rare earth nickel borocarbides rni@xmath0b@xmath0c ( r - rare earth ) constitute an interesting class of materials @xcite , in which there is a competition and coexistence between superconductivity and magnetism . amongst these compounds ,",
    "nonmagnetic luni@xmath0b@xmath0c has the highest superconducting critical temperature of 16.6 k @xcite .",
    "the borocarbides exhibit a peculiar anisotropy of the superconducting gap , the character of which is still under debate .",
    "it is believed that the gap is highly anisotropic in the two non - magnetic compounds luni@xmath0b@xmath0c and yni@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite .",
    "its symmetry was proposed to be _ s _ + _ g _ @xcite , which is consistent with certain experimental results @xcite but an anisotropic s - wave symmetry has also been considered @xcite .",
    "other experimental data indicate that the gap in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c has point nodes along the ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) directions @xcite .",
    "luni@xmath0b@xmath0c crystallizes in a body - centered tetragonal structure with lattice parameters _ a _ = 3.4639  , and _",
    "c _ = 10.6313 @xcite .",
    "its crystal structure consists of lu - c layers with ni@xmath0b@xmath0 sheets in between .",
    "previously calculations reveal that luni@xmath0b@xmath0c is characterised by a large density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy ( @xmath3 ) originating mainly , but not exclusively , from ni _ d _ electrons @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature is a flat band along the @xmath4-x direction just above @xmath3 .",
    "the fermi surface ( fs ) topography of luni@xmath0b@xmath0c was studied by ab - initio calculations @xcite .",
    "band structure calculations @xcite revealed a pronounced maximum in the generalized electronic susceptibility at ( @xmath50.6_a _ * , 0 , 0 ) , where _ a _ * @xmath6 and most likely arising from large nested regions of the fs .",
    "moreover , phonon softening was observed in luni@xmath0b@xmath0c by means of inelastic neutron scattering for a range of wave vectors around ( 0.5__a _ _ * , 0 , 0 ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough the magnetic ordering , which was found in rni@xmath0b@xmath0c compounds with magnetic atoms r = er , ho , tb and gd manifest similar modulation vector usually close to ( 0.55__a__*,0,0)@xcite . the first experimental studies of the luni@xmath0b@xmath0c ( rni@xmath0b@xmath0c ) fermi surface were performed by means of two - dimensional angular correlation of electron - positron annihilation radiation ( 2d - acar ) and the data were compared to the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) , local density approximation ( lda ) calculations @xcite . nested parts of the fs were found with a nesting vector corresponding to both the phonon softening and the magnetic modulation vectors .",
    "the fraction of the fs participating in nesting was determined to be 4.4 @xmath7 0.5% @xcite .",
    "that study was however limited only to a rough  calipering \" of the fermi surface .",
    "knowledge of the experimental band structure , fermi surface and quasiparticle properties is deemed essential to understand the interplay of the various interactions in these materials , as it may shed new light on other phenomena such as anisotropic superconductivity , the role of phonon softening and the relationship between the superconductivity and magnetic ordering in the borocarbides .",
    "it is also a pre - requisit for direct determination of the alleged anisotropy of the superconducting gap in these materials . in this report we present angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements of the band dispersion , fermi surface and supercondcuting gap in the borocarbide with the highest @xmath8 , luni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "the experimental results were compared with the tight - bounding lmto ( tb - lmto ) method and the full potential lapw calculations .",
    "we found reasonable agreement with theory .",
    "the most significant difference between the calculations and experimental data is the strength of the hybridization .",
    "we also determined the superconducting gap to be 2.58 mev ( extrapolated for t=0 ) , in good agreement with the gap expected from the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "luni@xmath0b@xmath0c single crystals were grown at ames laboratory by means of a high - temperature flux technique@xcite .",
    "the plate - like crystals were cleaved _ in situ _ at pressures better than 3 x 10@xmath10 tr to reveal and maintain fresh _",
    "a_-_b _ surfaces .",
    "the fermi surface and band structure mapping were performed at the 7.0.1 beamline at the advanced light source , using a scienta r4000 analyzer .",
    "the energy and angle resolution were set at @xmath5 30 mev and @xmath5 0.5 deg , respectively .",
    "the energy gap was measured with a scienta 2002 analyser and he - i photon source ( _ _ h__@xmath11 = 21.2 ev ) , in which the overall energy resolution was set at 2 mev .",
    "the normal state data were measured at the synchrotron radiation center using the pgm beamline and scienta 2002 endstation , with the energy and angular resolution set at @xmath5 13 mev and 0.25 deg , respectively .",
    "tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital calculations were performed by the tb - lmto program , version 47 @xcite , and the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( lapw ) calculations were performed using the wien2k package @xcite .",
    "band structure and semi - planar fermi surface cuts were determined for incident photon energies 128.13 ev , 119.44 ev and 102.98 ev ( fig .",
    "1b - d ) , where the @xmath4 point in the brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "1a ) corresponds to normal emission of electrons along the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "a @xmath12 correction term ( @xmath13 is the distance from the @xmath4 point ) was used to account for mapping of the momentum space onto the angular distribution of photoelectrons .",
    "the arpes process in 3d materials leaves some ambiguity as to the @xmath14 component of the momentum ( perpendicular to the sample surface ) , because it is not conserved in the photoemission process .",
    "this is due to jump of the potential at the sample surface . from conservation of energy and remaining components of the momentum one can calculate the relative changes of the @xmath14 for various photon energies . to obtain the offset one needs to seek guidance from the band structure calculations and identify the high symmetry points in the data.@xcite this allows estimation of the @xmath14 offset .",
    "the change of the wave vector component @xmath14 ( parallel to the _ c _ axis ) between scans in fig .",
    "1b ( @xmath15=128.13 ) and 1c ( @xmath15=119.44 ) was calculated from momentum and energy conservation to be 0.33 of the @xmath4-z distance .",
    "similarly the change of the wave vector component @xmath14 between scans in fig .",
    "1c ( @xmath15=119.44 ) and 1d ( @xmath15=102.98 ) was 0.66 of the @xmath4-z .",
    "the calculated fermi surfaces were obtained for constant @xmath14 values by means of the tb - lmto method and are shown in fig . 1 panels e - g .",
    "we estimated the values of the inner potential , @xmath16 = 9.4 ev and the work function @xmath17 = 4.6 ev , by comparing the high symmetry points between the calculated fermi surfaces and the experimental data .",
    "this allowed us to determine the offset of the photon energy that corresponds to @xmath14 = 0 .",
    "the fermi surface maps for the incident photon energies of 128.13 ev and 119.44 ev reveal large parallel parts of the fs with essentially the same nesting vector ( spacing between the linear sections ) : @xmath18 = ( 0.59 @xmath7 0.04)_a _ * for fig .",
    "1b and @xmath18 = ( 0.58 @xmath7 0.04)_a _ * for fig .",
    "@xmath14 is expressed in the units of the @xmath4-z distance , where the @xmath4 point corresponds to @xmath14 = 0 .",
    "although the full three dimensional fs was not determined in great detail , a similar nesting vector was found for different @xmath14 values which indicates that the fs likely has considerable nesting properties for a wide range of @xmath14 values .",
    "the constancy of the value of the nesting vector between @xmath14=0.15 and -0.2 is also consistent with results of calculations .",
    "the spacing between the parallel segments of the fermi surface predicted by tb - lmto calculation is between 0.54__a _ _ * and 0.55__a _ _ * , the lapw calculation results ( not shown ) are 0.50__a _ _ * and 0.57__a _ _ * , respectively .",
    "the detected @xmath18 is very close to the theoretically predicted value obtained from the generalized susceptibility @xcite .",
    "our results also agree reasonably well with the nesting vector previously determined via 2d - acar @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface map obtained at 102.98 ev very closely resembles the calculated fermi surface for @xmath14 = 0.8__a__*. the overall shapes of the measured and calculated fermi surface sheets ( fig",
    ". 1d and 1 g ) are very similar , however there is one significant difference . in the calculations",
    "the four oval parts of the fermi surface centered about @xmath4-z are well separated in momentum space ( fig .",
    "1 g ) , while the data reveals that they actually are connected at the edges ( fig .",
    "a lack of separation in the experimental data may indicate that the hybridization gap is overestimated in the calculations .",
    "these oval parts arise from the intersection of the electron and hole - like bands .",
    "interestingly enough at the edges along the diagonal directions ( e. g. 110 ) the bottom of the electron band and the top of the hole band appear to be pinned at the chemical potential , resulting in a characteristic  flower \" shape .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot the band dispersion data along a few selected cuts in momentum space obtained at an incident photon energy of 102.98 ev ( figs .",
    "2c - i ) , along with a calculated ( tb - lmto method ) band dispersion for @xmath19 0.8__a _ _ * ( figs .",
    "the agreement between the measured and calculated band dispersion is rather good , especially in the proximity of the chemical potential . in the corresponding tb - lmto calculations ( figs .",
    "2j - p ) , the same overall features are well reproduced , which shows the validity of the calculation in this material to a certain extent .",
    "this agreement also validates the assignment of @xmath14 values to the cuts measured at various photon energies , which is very important when studying 3d materials with arpes .",
    "the most significant difference is the hybridization gap , which is quite large in the calculations but its signatures are for the most part absent in the measured data .",
    "for example in fig . 2 panels ( k ) and",
    "( l ) the high and low energy branches form hybridization gap of about 200 mev at _ e _",
    "= -0.3 ev , while in the corresponding measured data ( panels ( d ) and ( e ) ) the bands appear to disperse without a signature of the hybridization gap",
    ". one should consider if the observed features have any relation to the superconducting gap asymmetry and observed phonon softening in luni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "it should be noted that band structure calculations @xcite show a flat band lies very close to , but slightly above , the fermi level .",
    "this feature was unfortunately not observed in our data due to the fermi function cut - off .",
    "however , a higher dos near the fermi level would explain the large number of scattered electrons observed with _",
    "k _ vectors along ( 110 ) and phonon softening for the discussed wave vectors . consequently this may lead to an anisotropy of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "this is in agreement with the results proposing for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c that the superconducting gap is larger just at ( 110 ) and diminishes or even has nodes along the ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) directions @xcite .",
    "given the above concern , we measured the energy gap in luni@xmath0b@xmath0c by partial angle - integrated photoelectron spectroscopy and compared with the normal state fermi surface .",
    "the opening of the superconducting gap is clearly shown in fig .",
    "3 . in order to determine the magnitude of the gap",
    ", the dynes function @xcite was fitted to the symmetrized @xcite spectrum ( fig .",
    "the fitted function yields the gap value of @xmath2 = 1.5 mev for the sample at _ t _ = 11 k with the @xmath4 parameter equal to 0.05 mev .    the striking feature in fig .",
    "3c is the pronounced peak above the chemical potential .",
    "this peak arises from thermal excitation of electrons above the 2@xmath2 .",
    "this points to high dos just above @xmath1 which is consistent with the idea that the flat band along ( 110 ) direction , a large part of which is slightly over the fermi energy playing an important role in this anisotropic superconductivity .",
    "similar peaks were recently reported in y based borocarbides @xcite . according to bcs theory",
    "the energy gap value at zero temperature ( @xmath20 ) is 2.45 mev for @xmath8 = 16 k superconductor .",
