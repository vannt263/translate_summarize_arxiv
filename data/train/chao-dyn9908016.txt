    "transport phenomena are at the heart of many problems in physics .",
    "nonlinear effects ( as well as their quantized counterparts ) may lead to many novel results in this area even for seemingly simple models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "well - known applications include the dynamics of josephson junctions @xcite and electronic transport through superlattices @xcite , to name a few . in the bulk of theoretical work on transport phenomena",
    "nonzero dc currents are obtained by applying time - dependent fields with nonzero mean .",
    "it is normally expected that the opposite case may not lead to a nonzero dc current .",
    "however it has been also known for a long time that nonlinear dynamical systems may allow for generation of ac fields from external dc fields ( josephson effect ) and even vice versa @xcite .",
    "of course what matters is a proper average over initial conditions , so that one has to ask whether there exist ( or do not exist ) sets of solutions which cancel their contribution to the total current .",
    "this question calls for an analysis of the symmetry properties of the system under consideration .",
    "let us make things more precise by considering a paradigmatic equation of the following type : @xmath7 functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are bounded and periodic with period @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively and have zero mean , and @xmath12 .",
    "this equation describes e.g. a particle moving in a periodic potential @xmath13 with @xmath14 in one space dimension under the influence of a periodic external field with friction @xcite .",
    "it also may describe the current - voltage properties of a small josephson junction under the action of a time - periodic external current ( here @xmath15 becomes the phase difference of the complex order parameter across the junction ) .",
    "this equation has been considered by numerous authors , however typically with harmonic functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we will show below that this choice induces symmetries which lead to zero total dc current .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to demonstrate that a proper lowering of the symmetries of even @xmath2 alone ( still keeping its above defined properties ) will lead to a nonzero dc current .",
    "we first consider the case of zero friction @xmath16 in ( [ 1 ] ) . in the limit of large velocities",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 can be neglected and the solution @xmath19 has a bounded first derivative .",
    "thus the time average over the velocity on a given trajectory is a well defined nondiverging quantity .    to characterize the relevant symmetries of ( [ 1 ] ) we have to consider transformations in @xmath20 which lead to a change of sign in @xmath21 .",
    "these are i ) a reflection in @xmath22 and a shift in @xmath3 or ii ) a shift in @xmath15 and a reflection in @xmath23 .",
    "we need first to characterize the relevant symmetries of @xmath18 and @xmath2 . for that we expand @xmath8 and @xmath9 into fourier series : @xmath24 .",
    "zero mean implies @xmath25 , and reality yields @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 means complex conjugation ) . if @xmath14 is antisymmetric after some appropriate argument shift @xmath29 we call @xmath18 possessing @xmath30 symmetry . if @xmath2 is symmetric after some appropriate argument shift @xmath31 we call @xmath2 possessing @xmath32 symmetry .",
    "if @xmath2 changes sign after a fixed argument shift ( which trivially can be only equal to any odd multiple of @xmath33 ) @xmath34 , resulting in @xmath35 , we call @xmath2 possessing @xmath36 symmetry .",
    "now we can define the two relevant symmetry cases of ( [ 1 ] ) called @xmath37 and @xmath38 below .",
    "if functions @xmath18 and @xmath2 possess @xmath30 and @xmath36 symmetries respectively , then ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under symmetry @xmath37 : @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "if function @xmath2 possesses @xmath41 symmetry , ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under symmetry @xmath38 : @xmath42 .    given a trajectory @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the presence of any of the two symmetries @xmath46 , @xmath47 allows to generate new trajectories given by @xmath48 note that these transformations change the sign of the velocity @xmath21 .",
    "consequently the time average of @xmath21 on the original trajectory will be opposite to the time averages of @xmath21 on the generated new trajectories",
    ". there can be more symmetry operations generating other trajectories , but those will not change the sign of @xmath21 and are thus not of interest here .",
    "the dynamical evolution of ( [ 1 ] ) allows both for quasiperiodic solutions ( cyclic in @xmath15 for large @xmath49 and periodic in @xmath15 for small @xmath49 ) and chaotic trajectories embedded in a stochastic layer @xcite . assuming that ergodicity holds in the stochastic layer we conclude that the average velocity will be one and the same for all trajectories of the layer . since @xmath37 and @xmath38 when applied to a trajectory inside the layer generate again trajectories inside the layer , the presence of any of these symmetries implies that the time - averaged velocity of any trajectory in the layer will be zero .",
    "note that we can not obtain such a conclusion if both symmetries are absent ! indeed in fig .",
    "1 we show the long - time run @xmath50 for a trajectory in the layer for several cases with and without symmetries @xmath51 . while with @xmath51 we find zero average velocities , we observe that the loss of @xmath51 leads to a nonzero average velocity which is independent on the initial conditions but whose sign depends on the way the symmetry is broken .",
    "the dynamics is characterized by anomalous transport , i.e. by lvy flights of different length interrupted by direction - changing perturbations .",
    "nonzero current appears due to a desymmetrization between lvy flights to the left and right , respectively .",
    "especially trajectory 2 in fig .",
    "1 yields a nonzero velocity for a spatially symmetric @xmath13 .    to answer the question of how to invert the direction of a nonzero current in the stochastic layer",
    ", we note that considering the equation @xmath52 we arrive back at ( [ 1 ] ) by substitution @xmath53 .",
    "so the current can be inverted by applying @xmath54 instead of @xmath2 in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "a second way is to consider equation @xmath55 which after substitution @xmath56 again is mapped onto ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "thus another way of inverting the current is to apply @xmath57 instead of @xmath18 and @xmath58 instead of @xmath2 in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "there is no simple way to invert the current by just inverting space i.e. by considering @xmath59 .    to get a grasp of this result we consider the quasiperiodic cyclic regime for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "note that @xmath37 symmetry is present if @xmath62 or @xmath63 and @xmath64 symmetry is present if @xmath65 or @xmath63 or @xmath66 .",
    "each individual trajectory for sufficiently large @xmath49 gives a nonzero average velocity .",
    "the question is whether we obtain a nonzero velocity after averaging over initial conditions with some distribution function @xmath67 reflecting equilibrium properties , at least of course @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69 is the time when the trajectories with initial conditions @xmath70 are started . in the simplest case",
    "we might assume that @xmath71 is independent of @xmath69 .",
    "consider the case @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in that case",
    "we can separate the solution @xmath50 into a slow part @xmath74 and a small fast part @xmath75 .",
    "expanding to linear order in the fast variable yields @xmath76 collecting the fast variables we find @xmath77 .",
    "this equation has to be solved by assuming that @xmath78 is constant and skipping the slow homogeneous solution part .",
    "we find @xmath79 with @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "final averaging over the fast variables in ( [ 7 ] ) gives @xmath82 .",
    "the crucial point is to observe that the initial condition is now @xmath83 . since @xmath75 is a completely defined function , defining the initial conditions for @xmath84 we obtain initial conditions for the slow variables .",
    "the symmetry breaking will be hidden there .",
    "indeed , averaging over time we find @xmath85 .",
    "assuming e.g. large values of @xmath49 the time average velocity of the slow variable will be simply @xmath86 $ ] with @xmath87 .",
    "expanding @xmath88 in powers of @xmath89 we will encounter terms @xmath90 $ ] . averaging over @xmath91 and @xmath69",
    "we obtain in leading order for the average velocity @xmath92 which remains nonzero and will contribute to an average nonzero current after further averaging over @xmath49 .",
    "note that the directed current disappears if @xmath63 or @xmath66 or @xmath93 when the mentioned symmetries are restored .",
    "the current direction is defined in this perturbation limit by the sign of the product @xmath94 . finally in the limit",
    "@xmath95 the current amplitude tends to zero , although the symmetries are not restored .",
    "the reason is that in this limit we recover the problem of a free particle moving under the influence of an external field @xmath2 which can be easily solved @xcite .",
    "averaging over @xmath69 in this case yields zero total current .",
    "it follows that nonzero total currents occur if symmetries @xmath37 and @xmath38 are violated and if we provide a mechanism of mixing of different harmonics as it happens in nonlinear equations of motion ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we checked the above statements of the perturbation theory for the quasiperiodic regime by computing numerically the average velocity @xmath96 for two initial conditions with opposite initial velocities @xmath97 , taking their half sum , and finally averaging over all possible initial positions @xmath91 and over the initial time @xmath69 .",
    "we observe a nonzero current except for the symmetric values of @xmath98 .",
    "finally we did the same direct computation in the initial equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the results are similar .    in order to keep the dc current nonzero the value of @xmath98",
    "should be kept fixed with time , or at least to be allowed to fluctuate only with small amplitude .",
    "additional averaging over @xmath98 will lead to a disappearance of the dc current . to our understanding",
    "this should not pose a technical difficulty , since one can take a monochromatic field source , and then experimentally generate a second harmonic from it such that the phase @xmath98 is fixed .",
    "consider now a small but nonzero value of @xmath99 in ( [ 1])(see @xcite ) .",
    "generically the phase space of the system will separate into basins of attraction of low - dimensional attractors . there exist strong hints that when being close to the hamiltonian case , these attractors will be periodic orbits or limit cycles ( cyclic in @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the stochastic layer is transformed into a complex transient part in phase space , where the basins of attraction of different limit cycles are entangled in a complicated way . for stronger deviations from the conservative limit",
    "the periodic attractors undergo ( period doubling ) bifurcations , and finally possibly chaotic attractors are generated , which are however not directly related to the stochastic layer of the conservative limit ( see also @xcite )",
    ".    of the two symmetries @xmath37 , @xmath38 in the conservative case only @xmath37 may survive for nonzero dissipation .",
    "consider such a case when ( [ 5 ] ) holds .",
    "suppose we find a limit cycle which is characterized by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "due to the external time - periodic field @xmath2 we have @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the average velocity @xmath105 on such a cycle will be given by @xmath106 .",
    "due to the required symmetry there will be also a limit cycle with @xmath107 .",
    "moreover the symmetry presence also implies that the basins of attraction of the two symmetry related limit cycles are equivalent .",
    "assume now that we violate @xmath37 .",
    "the two cycles previously related by symmetry to each other will generically continue to exist , but there is no obvious symmetry which relates them to each other .",
    "however after computing the average velocities , we will still find that they equal each other up to a sign !",
    "the symmetry breaking is in fact hidden in a _",
    "desymmetrization _ of the two basins of attraction .",
    "it is this asymmetry which after averaging over initial condition distributions ( symmetric in @xmath21 ) will lead to a different number of particles attracted to both cycles and thus to a nonzero current . to observe the desymmetrization of the basins",
    "locally we may tune some parameter of the equation to such a value that one of the cycles becomes unstable . in that case",
    "its basin of attraction shrinks to zero and disappears .",
    "if the other ( previously symmetry related ) cycle will be still stable , i.e. if its basin of attraction still exists , the asymmetry in the basins becomes obvious - one of them completely disappeared , the other one still exists .",
    "we tested these predictions and found complete agreement .",
    "we used @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 . the two symmetry related",
    "limit cycles ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) have been computed with a newton method ( see e.g. @xcite ) for @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "then the parameters were changed to @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 and the two limit cycles were traced again with a newton method . finally the eigenvalue problem ( @xmath118 matrix ) of the linearized phase space flow around each of the cycles has been evaluated in order to check the stability ( see @xcite for details ) . for the given parameter values",
    "the @xmath119 cycle is stable ( all floquet eigenvalues inside the unit circle ) while the @xmath120 cycle is unstable ( one floquet eigenvalue is outside the unit circle ) .    to observe the effect of asymmetry of basins of attraction globally , we computed the ensemble averaged velocity for a distribution of initial conditions in the phase space of ( [ 1 ] ) with forces ( [ 11])-([12 ] ) .",
    "the distribution was uniform in @xmath15 and @xmath69 ( 40 points on the interval from 0 to @xmath10 for each of them ) and @xmath121 points symmetrically chosen on the @xmath21-axis according to a maxwell distribution with inverse dimensionless temperature @xmath122 . in total 64000 trajectories have been computed .",
    "the velocity per trajectory averaged over the whole set of trajectories is shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of time for the case with @xmath37 symmetry ( curve 1 ) and the one without @xmath37 symmetry ( curve 2 ) . while the first case gives zero current density as @xmath6 , the second case yields nonzero negative current density in this limit .    in order to invert the direction of a nonzero total current we have to apply @xmath57 instead of @xmath18 and @xmath58 instead of @xmath2 in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the dissipationless case we can not just invert time in @xmath2 but have to perform a combined transformation both in space and time .",
    "taking just @xmath59 or @xmath54 may or may not lead to a change of the current direction .",
    "recall that directed currents can be generated by keeping @xmath123 and lowering the symmetry in @xmath2 only . in that case",
    "the current direction is inverted by applying @xmath58 .",
    "there exist a lot of publications on the properties of ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath16 ( and similar equations reduced to discrete maps ) , however we did not find studies of such a system when both symmetries @xmath37 and @xmath38 are broken . evidently , when taking @xmath8 and @xmath9 with only one harmonic , no symmetry broken transport is possible .",
    "the closest study in this respect we found in @xcite , where however , as explicitely stated , the symmetry was kept , leading to zero current when averaging over all possible trajectories .",
    "the overdamped case was studied in  @xcite .",
    "finally we want to discuss the relation of our results to the well - known case of directed currents for particles moving in so - called ratchet potentials under the influence of friction and a stochastic force ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these potentials lack inversion symmetry in space and thus lack @xmath30 symmetry ( see above ) .",
    "however the noise process characterizing the stochastic force has to be non - white ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it was then found that proper correlations in the noise allow for directed currents even in the presence of @xmath30 symmetry , i.e. for `` non - ratchet '' potentials . in @xcite",
    "these equations have been modified by adding time - periodic fields .",
    "note that our model allows for an easy treatment of the symmetry analysis , since the symmetry breaking is not hidden in higher order moments of distribution functions .",
    "if we consider corresponding quantum systems , the symmetry breaking will be reflected in the properties of the eigenstates , and nonzero currents can be expected as well .",
    "the addition of e.g. particle - particle interaction or noise can only affect the amplitude of the current , since the broken symmetries can not be restored by additional interactions .",
    "applications of similar ideas to coherent photocurrents in semiconductors have been reported in @xcite .",
    "further applications may include driven josephson junctions or superlattices , electrons in time - dependent magnetic fields to name a few .",
    "note that it should be much easier to realize experimentally our proposed symmetry breaking rather than to prepare correlated noise as proposed for ratchet transport .",
    "this work was partially supported by the intas foundation ( grant no . 97 - 574 ) .",
    "we are deeply indebted to a. a. ovchinnikov and p. hnggi for fruitful discussions and a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "we thank d. k. campbell , f. izrailev , y. a. kosevich , f. kusmartsev , m. sieber , g. zaslavsky for stimulating discussions and u. feudel for sending us preprints prior publication .                                          dependence",
