    "@xmath271  k. ]    temperature dependence of the spin dephasing rate @xmath280 at @xmath295  t is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsa2 ] . pump density of 0.8  @xmath238 is chosen in order to follow the signal in the whole temperature range from @xmath296  k to 100  k. the dephasing rate is about constant in the temperature range @xmath297  k and it increases linearly with a slope of 0.024  @xmath298 up to @xmath299  k. characteristic depth of the electron localizing potential evaluated from the exciton linewidth in the pl is about 0.5  mev , which corresponds to an activation temperature of 6  k. for the temperature range from 7  k to 100  k the dependence @xmath300 holds with high accuracy .",
    "such behavior is characteristic for the dyakonov - perel mechanism of spin relaxation .",
    "theory gives the following expression for the spin relaxation rate @xcite : @xmath301 here @xmath302 is the momentum relaxation time and @xmath303 is a coefficient characterizing dependence of the electron spin splitting on its wave vector .",
    "the effects of structure anisotropy on spin relaxation are neglected .",
    "the linear dependence measured experimentally allows us to suggest that in the studied sample @xmath302 is independent of temperature for @xmath304  k. this is in agreement with the fact that the electron mobility in cdte - based qws is rather low ( usually does not exceed few tens thousands @xmath305 ) and @xmath302 is rather short and falls in the picosecond range .",
    "with the use of various techniques based on continuous wave and pulsed excitation we have performed detailed experimental studies on optical spin pumping , spin relaxation and spin coherence of resident electrons in cdte/(cd , mg)te quantum wells .",
    "the experimental results are substantiated by a theoretical model based on classical approach to spins .",
    "polarization of the resident electrons and generation of their spin coherence is provided by a capture of the resident electrons into trions .",
    "the trions in turn can be either photogenerated by resonant excitation or formed from the excitons .",
    "variation of pump energy ( tuning to resonance with either the trion or the exciton ) highlights details of the polarization process .",
    "pump density dependencies for two excitation conditions are nearly the same for low densities ( as each absorbed photon participates in spin pumping ) and substantially different for high densities ( for the trion pump the spin polarization tends to 100% while for the exciton pump the spin polarization decreases to zero ) .",
    "spin beats and spin decay of resident electrons in external magnetic fields are shown to be subject of spin relaxation anisotropy and @xmath0-factor inhomogeneity .",
    "independent variation of pump and probe energies proves that electron localization provides an increase of the spin relaxation time , as also confirmed by temperature dependent experiments .",
    "the spin relaxation time of localized electrons can achieve 30  ns , as independently found in continuous wave experiment in the limit of low pump density and in pulsed experiments by means of resonant spin amplification .",
    "note , this is the longest spin relaxation time in qw heterostructures reported to date .",
