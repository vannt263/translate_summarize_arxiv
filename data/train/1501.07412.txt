    "in this paper in the context of ads / cft @xcite we study numerically the ground state of a pair of open strings stretching between two coincident @xmath2-branes with opposite orientations in @xmath3 of @xmath4 .",
    "the main motivation for the study is that according to string - theory the ground state of such a configuration is expected to be tachyonic for large values of the t hooft coupling @xcite . in our work",
    "we rely on the perturbatively discovered and later `` all loop conjectured '' integrability @xcite of both the @xmath4 super - string and the dual large @xmath5 gauge theory . for string configurations with d - branes integrability enabled one to describe string configurations ending on different types of d - branes as 1-dimensional integrable scattering theories with boundaries @xcite .",
    "this formulation of the problem makes it possible to go beyond the approaches of perturbative gauge and string theories being valid for small and large values of the t hooft coupling respectively , and to determine the exact spectrum of the model at any value of the coupling constant .",
    "however , even with the help of the powerful techniques offered by integrability , the exact analytical solution of the problem is not possible .",
    "remarkeble analytical results are available in the small @xcite and large @xcite coupling regimes , but the determination of the spectrum at any value of the coupling constant can only be carried out by high precision numerical solution @xcite of the corresponding nonlinear integral equations .",
    "in our paper we consider the case , when the two @xmath2-branes are giant gravitons @xcite , namely they carry @xmath5 units of angular momenta in @xmath3 .",
    "if the @xmath3 of @xmath4 is parametrized by three complex coordinates @xmath6 satisfying the constraint : @xmath7 , then our @xmath2-brane and anti-@xmath2-brane are given by the conditions @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "they wrap the same @xmath10 , but with opposite orientation . as a consequence of gauss law such",
    "a system can support only even number of open strings .",
    "for this reason we study the minimal number of allowed open strings , a single pair , ending on our d - brane anti - d - brane ( @xmath11 ) system with open string angular momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    on the large @xmath5 gauge theory side a @xmath8 brane",
    "is represented by a determinant operator @xcite composed of @xmath5 copies of the field @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are color indices and @xmath18 is a product of two regular epsilon tensors @xmath19 . the local operator corresponding to an open string ending on a @xmath8 giant graviton can be obtained from ( [ detyy ] ) by replacing one @xmath14 field with an adjoint valued operator @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath21 the gauge theory description of a pair of open strings stretching between two @xmath22-branes is given by a double determinant operator , such that the string insertions @xmath20 and @xmath23 connect the two determinants of the @xmath14 fields : @xmath24 unfortunately , the precise gauge theory dual of the @xmath11-system of our interest is not known .",
    "in @xcite it was approximated by a double determinant operator similar to ( [ detyywv ] ) , but in one of the determinants the @xmath14 fields are replaced with @xmath25 fields and @xmath25 , but should be similar to the double determinant form ( [ yybar ] ) and the mixing with other fields seem to be suppressed at large @xmath5 ] : @xmath27 for the ground state the insertions are @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively . based on one - loop results",
    "the planar dilatation operator is expected to act independently on the two words @xmath30 corresponding to the open string states @xcite : @xmath31 = \\delta_{\\rm bare } [ { \\cal o}_{y\\bar y}^{{\\cal w } , { \\cal v } } ]   + \\delta \\delta [ { \\cal w}_{y\\bar y } ] + \\delta \\delta [ { \\cal v}_{\\bar y y } ] .",
    "\\label{dim split}\\ ] ] this observation allows us to apply the boundary thermodynamic bethe ansatz technique ( btba ) @xcite to each open string separately .",
    "the necessary ingredients of this technique are the boundary reflection factors @xcite and the asymptotic bethe equations of the problem @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , apart from some very special cases @xcite , it is still unknown how to derive btba equations for a general non - diagonal scattering theory in the context of the thermodynamical considerations of @xcite .",
    "this is why in @xcite the @xmath14-system @xcite and the related discontinuity @xcite equations supplemented by analyticity assumptions compatible with the asymptotic solution @xcite were used to derive btba equations for the nonperturbative study of the ground state of the @xmath11-system @xcite .",
    "the btba description of the system is an infinite set of nonlinear integral equations .",
    "the numerical solution of the equations @xcite showed that the ground state energy is a monotonously decreasing function of the coupling constant and the t hooft coupling @xmath32 is given by : @xmath33 . ]",
    "the analytical investigation of the large rapidity and large index behavior of the @xmath14-functions of the btba revealed that the usual btba description of the system breaks down when the energy of an open string state with angular momentum @xmath12 gets close to the critical value : @xmath35 .",
    "this point was interpreted in @xcite as a transition point where the ground state becomes tachyonic . approaching the critical point the contribution of infinitely many @xmath14-functions must be taken into account to get accurate numerical result for the energy .",
    "this fact suggests reformulating the finite size problem in terms of finite number of unknown functions",
    ". the possible candidates could be the finlie @xcite , the quantum spectral curve ( qsc ) @xcite or the hybrid - nlie ( hnlie ) @xcite formulation of the problem .",
    "since at present it is not known ( not even for the konishi problem ) how to use the analytically very efficient @xcite qsc method for numerical purposes , we choose the hnlie method to reformulate the finite size problem of the @xmath11-system . in this paper",
    "we transformed the infinite set of boundary tba equations @xcite into a finite set of hybrid - nlie type of nonlinear integral equations .",
    "we perform the extensive numerical study of these type of equations in order to get as close to the special @xmath36 critical point as it is possible .",
    "our numerical results reproduce the numerical evaluation of the boundary lscher formula @xcite in the linear approximation , and the numerical btba results of @xcite as well .",
    "these numerical comparisons give further numerical checks on the hybrid - nlie technique of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as @xmath34 increases new local singularities enter the hnlie formulation of the problem .",
    "thus we could not approach very close to the critical point .",
    "nevertheless , in the range of @xmath34 where physically acceptable numerical results were obtained , the hnlie results could give higher numerical precision than that of the btba and also some interesting facts could be read off from our numerical data .    during the numerical solution of the hnlie equations straightforward numerical iterative methods failed to converge ,",
    "thus new numerical methods were worked out to solve the equations .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath0 state is a very special case , since there the critical point is right at @xmath37 and so far neither perturbative field theory computations nor the boundary lscher formula could provide a finite quantitative answer to the anomalous dimension of this state . on the integrability side the hnlie approach allows us to get some numerical insight into this problem .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section 2 . contains the hnlie equations . in section 3 .",
    "the numerical method is described . in section 4 .",
    "the numerical results and their interpretation is presented .",
    "section 5 .",
    "contains some comments on the mysterious @xmath0 case and finally our conclusion is given in section 6 .",
    "various notations , kernels of the integral equations together with the necessary asymptotic solutions are placed in the appendices of the paper .",
    "in this section we transform the previously proposed btba equations of @xcite for the ground state of our d - brane anti - d - brane system to finite component hybrid - nlie equations . for presentational purposes we group the equations into 3 types .",
    "there are tba - type equations , horizontal @xmath38 hybrid - nlie type equations , and vertical @xmath39 hybrid - nlie type equations .",
    "they together form a closed set of nonlinear integral - equations , which are solved numerically in this paper . as it is usual ,",
    "structurally the equations consist of source terms plus convolutions containing coupling dependent kernels and nonlinear combinations of the unknown functions . the objects appearing in the arguments of the source functions",
    "are subjected to quantization conditions , but similarly to the boundary tba description @xcite , due to the @xmath40 symmetry of the problem they are tied to the origin of the complex plane , thus extra quantization conditions are unnecessary to be imposed , since they are automatically satisfied by symmetry . since these source term objects have fixed positions their positions are exactly the same as that of their asymptotic counterparts .",
    "this fact saves us from the tedious computation of the source terms , since if we take the difference of the exact equations and their asymptotic counterparts the source terms cancel from the equations . to be pragmatic and save time and space ,",
    "the equations will be presented in such a difference form .",
    "thus for any combination @xmath41 of the unknown functions , we introduce the notation @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the asymptotic counterpart of @xmath41 . having introduced this notation , we start the presentation of the equations by the tba - type part . for the labeling of the @xmath14-functions we use the string - hypothesis @xcite based notations of @xcite . for the presentation of the equations a few more notations need to be introduced : @xmath44 , \\qquad   { \\mathscr l}_{m}=\\log\\left[\\tau^2 \\left ( 1+\\frac{1}{y_{m|vw}}\\right ) \\right ] , \\qquad   \\tau(u)=\\tanh(\\frac{\\pi g u}{4}).\\ ] ] for later numerical purposes we re - parametrize @xmath45 by the formula : @xmath46}(u)}{x^{[-q]}(u)}+\\log \\bar{y}_q(u ) + c_q+\\varepsilon \\ , \\log\\left(u^2+\\frac{(q+1)^2}{g^2}\\right ) , \\qquad q=1,2 , ... \\label{separ}\\ ] ] such that @xmath47 is the constant value of @xmath45 at infinity and @xmath48 is minus twice the energy multiplier of @xmath48 in ( [ separ ] ) is chosen not to modify the constant term in the large @xmath49 behavior and to satisfy @xmath50 , which is the lhs of an important @xmath14-system equation divided by its asymptotic counterpart . ] : @xmath51 . from the tba equations of the problem @xcite",
    ", it follows that @xmath52 is @xmath53-independent , and for small @xmath34 , @xmath54 is a smooth deformation of its asymptotic counterpart , such that @xmath55 tends to zero at infinity .",

    "our numerical method can be applied to solve other type of nonlinear integral equations as well .",
    "the power of the method is shown by the fact that numerical convergence was reached even in such cases , when the solution was physically unacceptable .",
    "the numerical method consist of two main steps , namely :    * discretization of the equations * iterative solution .",
    "the first step involves the discretization of the unknown functions and kernels , furthermore the discrete approximate representation of the convolutions . having carried out the appropriate discretization of the problem ,",
    "the equations are considered as large nonlinear algebraic set of equations .",
    "thus eventually instead of integral equations we solve discrete algebraic equations . in this paper",
    "we will present two methods to solve them numerically .",
    "the discretization serves two goals .",
    "first it allows us to reduce the numerical problem from solving integral equations to solving algebraic equations .",
    "second choosing the discretization points appropriately it reduces the number of degrees of freedom as much as it is possible to reach the desired numerical accuracy . in our actual numerical computation instead of @xmath49 of section 2 .",
    "we used the new rapidity @xmath135 , because with such a scaling almost all the rapidity difference dependent kernels become @xmath34 independent .",
    "thus for example @xmath136 will be defined in @xmath137 $ ] . to decrease the number of discretization points the @xmath138 symmetry of the problem",
    "is exploited .",
    "this means that the @xmath14-functions are to be discretized only on @xmath139 $ ] or @xmath140 $ ] and as for the nlie variables it is enough to discretize the @xmath91- and @xmath105- type variables on @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "since we do not want to introduce any cutoff in the rapidity space first we transform the @xmath141 $ ] interval to a finite interval @xmath142 $ ] through the transformation formula : @xmath143 this formula is chosen such that the branch point @xmath144 corresponds to @xmath145 for any choice of the parameter @xmath146 , where @xmath146 is a global scaling factor which changes from unknown to unknown .",
    "we chose the values as follows : for @xmath147 @xmath148 , for @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath149 , for @xmath150 and @xmath151 @xmath152 , for @xmath153 and @xmath154 @xmath155 , and finally for the @xmath91- and @xmath105-type nlie functions @xmath155 .",
    "these values are chosen to preserve the smoothness of the transformed functions in the finite interval .",
    "after this transformation all of our unknown functions live on a finite interval .",
    "to discretize them we used piecewise chebyshev approximation .",
    "this means that we divide the finite interval into subintervals and on each subinterval the functions are approximated by a given order chebyshev series .",
    "the choice of subintervals is not equidistant .",
    "the subintervals are placed more densely around the branch points , since the function @xmath156 , which governs the decay of the massive @xmath157-functions , has the largest change around this point .",
    "the advantage of the chebyshev approximation is that if the function is smooth enough on the subinterval , the coefficients of the chebyshev series decay rapidly and the order of magnitude of the last coefficient allows us to estimate the numerical errors of the procedure .",
    "now we describe the discretization method in more detail .",
    "our functions are defined on either @xmath158 $ ] or on @xmath159 $ ] .",

    "will sketch the basic idea in some typical scenarios appearing in our equations .",
    "then its application to the concrete unknowns and kernels of the problem is straightforward .",
    "if one takes the equations at the required discretized points @xmath179 the following typical pattern arises : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the symmetrized kernel to exploit left - right symmetry of the problem for reducing to half the number of variables .",

    "if @xmath187 is discretized by a subinterval vector @xmath167 of @xmath188 $ ] , then the numerical approximation of the right hand side goes as follows ;    * first the integration variable is changed from @xmath189 to @xmath183 , * then on each subinterval @xmath187 is approximated by its chebyshev series , * finally the integration is carried out and the convolution is expressed in terms of the discretized values of @xmath187 .",
    "the final approximation formula takes the form : @xmath190 where @xmath191 , @xmath192 denotes the dimension of @xmath167 and @xmath193 is the discretized convolution matrix given by the formula : @xmath194 in this manner a convolution is reduced to a discrete matrix - vector multiplication .",
    "the other type of typical convolution is when the integration is taken from zero to @xmath144 . in certain cases",
    "the function @xmath184 has square root behavior close to the branch points and @xmath195 . ] . for such functions the truncated chebyshev series does not give accurate approximation . in these cases",
    "not the function @xmath184 is approximated , but that part of it which remains after the elimination of the square root behavior .",
    "namely , we write @xmath196 , then @xmath197 is approximated by a truncated chebyshev series and finally the approximate discretized form of the corresponding convolution is very similar to ( [ intapproxt ] ) : @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 is the square root factor modified version of ( [ tksmatrix ] ) ; @xmath201 here depending on the left hand side of the equation @xmath202 can stand for @xmath203 , @xmath142 $ ] for some @xmath146 , or it can denote the sampling points on @xmath159 $ ] .    applying our discretization technique to all unknowns and convolutions of our equations",
    ", we can reduce the integral equations to a discrete set of nonlinear algebraic equations .",
    "however , the transformation from integral equations to algebraic equations is obviously not exact .",
    "the typical error comes from the fact that on each subinterval the chebyshev series is truncated , so the magnitude of the typical errors in our numerical method is governed by the neglected terms of the chebyshev series , which can be approximated by the magnitude of the last chebysev coefficient . in our case",
    "this is typically somewhere between @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the last step of our numerical method is the iterative solution starting from the asymptotic solution .      here",
    "we will describe two methods to solve our integral equations iteratively .",
    "since our actual equations have very complicated form , we will describe our methods using a model example , which has similar structure to our equations .",
    "let the model equations take the form : @xmath206 where @xmath207 are some kernel matrices , @xmath208 are some source terms and @xmath209s are the unknown functions of the problem .",
    "the solution of ( [ modelleq ] ) is expanded around the asymptotic solution and the equations are formulated in terms of the corrections .",
    "to fix the conventions , the correction functions @xmath210 are defined by : @xmath211 as a consequence : @xmath212 the source term is also expanded around its asymptotic counterpart : @xmath213 . then equations ( [ modelleq ] ) can be reformulated in terms of the @xmath210 functions as follows : @xmath214 to define the iterative method , ( [ dmodelleq ] ) are reformulated so that only @xmath215 terms remain on the right hand side of the equations .",
    "thus the equations are rewritten in the form : @xmath216-\\left [ \\log(1+\\delta y_a)-\\delta y_a \\right ] .",
    "\\label{iteq1}\\ ] ] it can be seen that on the left hand side of ( [ iteq1 ] ) all the quantities are @xmath217 , while on the right hand side all the quantities are @xmath215 .",
    "this separation allows us to define an iterative solution .",
    "if @xmath210s are small then the rhs is a small correction with respect to the lhs , this is why in an iterative solution the rhs can be simply taken at the value of the previous iteration .",
    "let @xmath218 the value of @xmath210 after the @xmath219th iteration , then @xmath220 can be determined from @xmath218 by solving a set of linear integral equations : @xmath221-\\left [ \\log(1+\\delta y^{(n)}_a)-\\delta y^{(n)}_a \\right ] .",
    "\\label{iteq2}\\ ] ] thus at each step of this iterative method a set of linear integral equations must be solved . using the discretization method of the previous subsection",
    ", the problem reduces to solving a set of linear algebraic equations , which is a straightforward task in numerical mathematics .",
    "the very first ( @xmath222th ) iteration starts from the asymptotic solution @xmath223 and it corresponds to the solution of the linearized equations , which in our case gives the lscher - formula for the energy .",
    "this ( first ) method in a certain range of the coupling constant defined a numerically convergent iteration to solve the equations for the ground state of our d - brane anti - d - brane problem , but beyond a certain value of @xmath34 the method failed to converge anymore .",
    "this is why we worked out a second method , which proved to be much more efficient than the first one .",
    "this efficiency is manifested in two facts .",
    "first it converges much faster than the previous iterative method , second it gives convergent solutions to our equations even when the solution can not be accepted as physical one .",
    "this second method can be described simply in words . instead of defining an iteration as above , we simply take the discretized version of ( [ dmodelleq ] ) .",
    "we consider it as a set of nonlinear algebraic equations . as a first step we solve the linearized discrete equations ( i.e. ( [ iteq2 ] ) with @xmath224 ) and starting from the solution of the linearized equations we solve the discrete nonlinear system by newton - method``newton '' ] . ] .",
    "in this section we summarize our numerical results .",
    "we solved numerically the equations for several integer values of the length parameter @xmath12 . in this section",
    "we concentrate on the states with @xmath225 .",
    "the @xmath0 special case is discussed in the next section . for the explanation of the numerical data we will mostly use the @xmath226 case as an example , because the critical point of this state is the closest one to zero , so it is enough to work with relatively small values of the coupling constant .",
    "this is important from the numerical point of view , since by increasing @xmath34 the numerical method becomes more and more time consuming .",
    "first the parameters of the numerical method is discussed .",
    "there are three parameters in the nonlinear integral equations ( [ tbamvw])-([lasteq ] ) .",
    "the most important one is the coupling constant @xmath34 , then there are two other parameters which allow us to formulate the equations according to our purposes .",
    "the two parameters are @xmath65 and @xmath227 , where @xmath65 is a kind of `` truncation index '' , which tells us the node number starting from which the upper tba equations are replaced by @xmath39 nlie variables ( see figure [ yhnlie ] . ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath227 is a free parameter in the asymptotic solution for the upper @xmath39 nlie variables ( [ bfirst]-[dvect ] ) and it enters the equations such that the asymptotic solution around which the equations are formulated contain this parameter .    from this discussion",
    "it is obvious that @xmath34 is a physical parameter which means that the energy depends on it , while the other two parameters @xmath65 and @xmath227 correspond to different formulations of the same mathematical problem , so the energy does not depend on them .",
    "thus the choice of these parameters is in our hand and we tried to choose such values for them which allows us numerical convergence in the widest range in @xmath34 .",
    "for example the @xmath104 choice is the best for numerical purposes since due to ( [ bmmd ] ) a @xmath40 symmetry arises in the @xmath39 hnlie variables minimizing the number of unknowns in the problem .",
    "tuning @xmath65 might have two advantages .",
    "first , numerical experience shows that for large @xmath65 the chebyshev coefficients of the unknowns entering the formula ( [ omegakq ] ) for @xmath228 , decay faster , which allows for higher numerical precision .",
    "second also from numerics we learn that with @xmath65 fixed at certain values of @xmath34 non physical results are obtained from the numerical solution of the problem .",
    "this is a consequence of new local singularities entering the problem , but we still did not take them into account in the equations .",
    "these new singularities show up mostly in the @xmath39 nlie variables , thus by increasing the value of @xmath65 the appearance of such singularities in the equations can be postponed to higher values of @xmath34 .",
    "we solved numerically our equations for different values of @xmath12 and with various values of @xmath65 and @xmath227 , and in case the numerical result was physically acceptable for all @xmath65 and @xmath227 we tried , it was also independent of these parameters within the numerical errors of the method .",
    "so far we discussed the parameters of the continuous integral equations and their role in the numerical solution .",
    "now we turn to discuss the numerical parameters of the equations .",
    "the numerical parameters are artifacts of the numerical method , and they arise mostly from the discretization method described in section 3 .",
    "we note that there is no cutoff parameter in our numerical method , neither in the integration range nor in the index of @xmath14-functions .",
    "everything is treated in an exact manner , the only source of numerical errors is the discretization of the unknowns and the convolutions . here",
    "we give the most used subinterval vectors of our numerical computations . on each subinterval",
    "we used an @xmath229 order chebyshev approximation .",
    "the subinterval vector @xmath161 of @xmath230 $ ] is given by the empirical formula : @xmath231 where the vectors in components take the form : @xmath232 + 1 } , \\qquad k=1, ... ,[2g]+1,\\ ] ] @xmath233 with @xmath234 having vector components : @xmath235 } , \\qquad j=1, ... ,\\left[2 g-\\frac32\\right].\\ ] ] here @xmath236 $ ] stands for integer part .",
    "the set of subinterval vectors @xmath160 of @xmath158 $ ] could also be given by an appropriate empirical formula , but it would take such a complicated form , that it is better to write down the requirements from which it can be constructed . ] .",
    "the requirements can be formulated in the language of the variable @xmath237 $ ] .",
    "the elements of the vector @xmath160 divide the interval @xmath158 $ ] into subintervals .",
    "our requirements constrain the allowed length of the subintervals with respect their location within the whole interval @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "the requirements are as follows :    * the first element of @xmath160 is @xmath238 . *",
    "the length of subintervals @xmath239 in the range @xmath240 is approximately @xmath241 : @xmath242 . *",
    "the length of subintervals in the range @xmath243 is approximately @xmath238 : @xmath244 . *",
    "the length of subintervals in the range @xmath245 is approximately @xmath246 : @xmath247 .    in practice",
    "the length of the subintervals are slightly `` squeezed '' with respect to the conditions above to fill the full @xmath158 $ ] properly . ] .",
    "finally , we note that for checking the numerical precision , we also did numerical computations with @xmath248 keeping the subintervals fixed and also with keeping @xmath229 , but doubling the number of subinterval points .    before turning to present the numerical results we would like to say a few words about the possible tests of the numerical results .",
    "namely , how one can recognize a wrong result .",
    "this is also a very important point of the numerical method , since there are a lot of equations with very complicated kernels and it is easy to make mistakes during writing the code of the numerical solution .",
    "there are three basic things that we can check from the numerical results .",
    "the first check is dictated by the energy equation ( [ eps ] ) .",
    "it is known that the energy starts at the first wrapping order ( i.e. @xmath249 ) and this first order correction is exactly given by the lscher formula @xcite : @xmath250 with @xmath251 given explicitly in ( [ yqo ] ) .",
    "this quantity can be computed numerically with any digits of precision , so its value is known exactly at any values of @xmath34 and @xmath12 . the lscher - formula ( [ luscher0 ] )",
    "corresponds to the linearized version of our equations ( [ tbamvw])-([lasteq ] ) , this is why solving the linearized set of equations ( which is the first step for the iterative solution ) we should reproduce the numerical evaluation of ( [ luscher0 ] ) .",
    "this is a nontrivial check on the kernels , on the discretization method and on the equations themselves as well .",
    "in addition since this test is quantitative it can tell some information also on the numerical precision of the method ) within certain digits of precision , than the deviation from the lscher result can be a good starting estimate to the numerical error .",
    "one can not expect better accuracy , but the precision will not become much worse either . ] .",
    "this test can signal problems on solving the linearized problem .",
    "the remaining two tests can signal some discrepancies during the solution of the nonlinear problem .",
    "the second testing condition is that from the numerical solution @xmath252 must be real .",
    "this sound trivial , but it is not trivial at all .",
    "if one takes a look at the equation ( [ yvwp0m2 ] ) of @xmath252 , one can recognize that there are complex quantities on the rhs which do not form conjugate pairs .",
    "so , the reality of the lhs is not guaranteed by the form of the equations , but it is guaranteed by the form of the solution .",
    "thus the second testing condition is expressed by the inequality : @xmath253 here we wrote the typical numerical errors we had during the computations .",
    "the third test is based on the approximation scheme we use .",
    "one must check whether the chebyshev coefficients of the unknowns decay as it is expected .",
    "from such a check the numerical precision of the method can be read off and it can shed light on some anomalous divergent behavior of the numerical solution . thus it can indicate possible errors in the elimination of the divergent @xmath254 terms in ( [ separ ] ) and ( [ b2bar],[d2bar ] ) .    the numerical results for the @xmath226 case can be seen in figure [ al2 ] and table [ tl2 ] . in the table",
    "we show not only the energy @xmath255 at different values of the coupling @xmath34 , but the constant @xmath73 , as well .",
    "the other columns of the table are related to the solution of the linearized equations ; @xmath256 and @xmath257 are the energy and the global constant from the numerical solution of the linearized equations .",
    "@xmath258 stands for the deviation of @xmath256 from the exact lscher result .",
    "this quantity gives some information on the numerical accuracy of the method .",
    "finally the column `` number of nodes '' tells us the cutoff index of the lscher formula , which is necessary to get the lscher energy with the precision given by @xmath258 .",
    "this number is not equal to @xmath65 in our equations . for the @xmath226 state , in case of @xmath259 we used @xmath260 , for @xmath261 we used @xmath262 , and in the range @xmath263 we took @xmath264 .",
    "finally at @xmath265 we used @xmath266 to get acceptable numerical results . then beyond this point",
    "we could not save our equations from the entrance of new singularities by increasing the value of @xmath65 with a reasonable @xmath267 amount . because of this reason we could not get really close to the supposed critical point . there @xmath268 , but we could reach only @xmath269 at @xmath265 .",
    "apart from this very embarrassing fact , some important features can be read off from the numerical data .",
    "first of all it can be seen that in the range @xmath270 the energy is very slowly varying function of @xmath34 , so there is no sign of any divergent behavior .",
    "what is more interesting is the behavior of the global constant @xmath73 .",
    "it is negative and it decreases faster and faster as @xmath34 is increased . from the definition of @xmath73 ( [ separ ] )",
    "it follows that all @xmath157-functions are proportional to its exponent : @xmath271 .",
    "the fast decrease of @xmath73 indicates that though @xmath157 has worse and worse large @xmath49 asymptotic by the increase of @xmath34 , its global magnitude is actually decreasing .",
    "this remark can be understood from the tba formulation of the energy . @xmath272 close to the critical point @xmath255 is supposed to be finite @xcite @xmath273 , but naively the sum in the rhs of ( [ ebtba ] ) would diverge due to the large @xmath53 terms . since @xmath157 is small for large @xmath53 , in leading order . ]",
    "the @xmath274 replacement can be done : @xmath275 where @xmath276 is an arbitrary index cutoff scale and @xmath277 replacement was applied .",
    "since @xmath278 is @xmath53-independent all the dangerous @xmath53 dependence is still in @xmath279 . in ( [ ebtba1 ] ) approaching to the critical point the second sum starts to diverge , and the global multiplicative factor @xmath278 must tend to zero in order to ensure the finiteness of both sides of the equation . our numerical data seems to support this picture .",
    "namely @xmath280 as going closer and closer to the critical point .",

    "the @xmath0 ground state is mysterious , since so far the anomalous dimension of this state could not be determined even for small @xmath34 either from field theory or from integrability considerations @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on the integrability side .",
    "there the boundary lscher formula @xcite diverges for this state @xcite . for generic @xmath12",
    "the lscher formula is simply the expansion of the tba energy formula around the asymptotic solution with the replacement : @xmath281 . for small coupling",

    "the critical point is right at @xmath37 assuming that for small @xmath34 the energy is also small .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the hnlie description of the problem detailed in section 2 .",
    "here there are no infinite sums and even for @xmath0 all the convolutions of the integral equations seem to converge behavior of the unknown functions , which was used to derive the btba equations from discontinuity relations and y - system . ] .",
    "for the first sight there is no sign of any problem in the hnlie description and it seems that only the tba description is inappropriate to treat the @xmath0 case .",
    "but unfortunately this is not the case .",
    "we can write down the discretized integral equations for the @xmath0 case as well , and using the newton - method , we can solve them for small values of the coupling . ] .",
    "we always get some numerical solution for the discretized problem , but it turns out that the chebyshev coefficients of the unknowns , which correspond to the large @xmath49 subinterval do not form a decaying series .",
    "this phenomenon is a typical sign of some weak ( probably logarithmic ) large @xmath49 divergence of the unknowns .",
    "if one increases the number of subintervals and sampling points the situation remains the same .",
    "the conclusion is that we can solve the discretized problem , but the solution can not be interpreted as the discretely approximated version of the continuous solution of our integral equations . in other words",
    "the continuous hnlie equations have no solution for @xmath0 .    in order to get some analytical insight why the solutions become diverging at large @xmath49",
    "let us consider the tba formulation of the problem ( @xmath286 in hnlie ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that the tba energy comes from the coefficient of the most divergent @xmath287 term in the large @xmath49 expansion of @xmath45 : @xmath288 the @xmath255 term originates from the rhs of the tba equations for @xmath45 from the convolution term @xmath289 by exploiting the large @xmath49 expansion of the kernel : @xmath290 . @xmath291 has better large @xmath292 behavior than that of @xmath293 , since it behaves like @xmath294 . as a consequence contrary to the energy formula ,",
    "the sum of dressing convolutions is convergent indeed .",
    "thus one might think that for @xmath0 the problem emerges , because for the derivation of the energy formula we expanded the sum of dressing convolutions term by term for large @xmath49 .",
    "this is why instead of this usual procedure , we consider the sum of dressing convolutions itself , compute it and then at the end of the computation we take the large @xmath49 expansion .",

    "we need the leading order small coupling expression of the dressing kernel in the mirror - mirror channel . ] : @xmath295 + .... \\end{split}\\ ] ] then the formula , the large @xmath49 expansion of which accounts for the small coupling expanded energy , is given by : @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the leading small coupling expression of ( [ yqo ] ) at @xmath0 .",
    "the second derivative of @xmath298 can be computed explicitly by simple fourier space technique .",
    "we take the fourier form of each functions under integration , the convolution is the product of the individual fourier transforms , the sum for @xmath292 can be easily done in fourier space and at the end of the process everything is transformed back to the @xmath49 space . in such a manner one gets a bulky , but explicit expression for @xmath299 , which we do not present here , only its large @xmath49 expansion : @xmath300 integrating twice the large @xmath49 expansion at small coupling becomes : @xmath301 from ( [ o ] ) it is obvious why the naive lscher energy formula diverged . because the leading order large @xmath49 term is not the expected @xmath302 , but @xmath303 .",
    "this is the key point of the problem , since in this case after this first iteration @xmath157 acquires an unwanted type of large @xmath49 term , which makes @xmath157 divergent for large @xmath49 : @xmath304 this large @xmath49 divergence contradicts to what was assumed about the large @xmath49 behavior of @xmath157 at the derivation of the integral equations , since it was supposed to decay . in this example",
    "we have shown in the small coupling limit , that during the iterative solution of the btba equations , @xmath45 acquires an extra @xmath305 behavior at infinity , which made @xmath157 an exploding function at infinity .",
    "this means that the iterative solution of the tba equations leaves the class of physically acceptable solutions .",
    "one might ask the question , whether it is possible to keep somehow the qualitative large @xmath49 behaviors that we assumed at the derivation of the equations ? here we sketch a possible idea for small coupling to the @xmath0 case .    let us assume that we managed to modify the tba equations , such that all @xmath14-functions have the large @xmath49 behavior we want . since most of the tba equations reflect the structure of the @xmath14-system functional equations we expect to modify only those equations which are affected by also the discontinuity relations .",
    "it follows , that for large @xmath53 , the formula for the estimate for @xmath157 ( [ largeyq ] ) remains the same .",
    "now , we assume that for small @xmath34 the energy is also small and take the simultaneous small @xmath34 and small energy expansion of the rhs of the tba energy formula ( [ ebtba ] ) . in",
    "leading order the large @xmath53 terms will dominate : @xmath306 where @xmath307 denotes the large @xmath53 estimate ( [ largeyq ] ) of @xmath157 , @xmath308 as a consequence of the @xmath309 change of variables and the pole term in @xmath255 comes from the pole of the @xmath283-function . in our hnlie approach",
    "the energy @xmath255 and the constant @xmath73 are parts of the equations which means that they are not simply expressed by explicit formulas based on the solution of the equations , but must me obtained by solving the set of non - trivially entangled equations . in this sense ( [ espec1 ] ) defines an equation for @xmath255 for small @xmath34 .",
    "its leading order solution is : @xmath310 if @xmath311 then @xmath255 becomes imaginary as it would be expected from string - theory expectations @xcite . to decide the sign of @xmath312 , the equation ( [ chybrid ] ) has to be analyzed in the context of the small @xmath34 and @xmath255 expansion .",
    "it turns out that @xmath312 is positive and @xmath313 for small @xmath34 , so according to ( [ eim1 ] ) @xmath255 is imaginary .",
    "another remarkable fact is that according to ( [ eim1 ] ) @xmath255 starts at @xmath314 instead of the @xmath315 prediction of the boundary lscher formula ( [ luscher ] ) .",
    "this might be another explanation why the coefficient of @xmath316 diverges in the lscher formula for the @xmath0 case .",
    "finally , we note that in the small @xmath34 and @xmath255 expansion of the @xmath0 state , the energy is pure imaginary only at leading order in @xmath34 , but in higher orders it acquires real part as well .",
    "for the first sight , it might seem that without modifying the equations one immediately gets imaginary energy when going through the critical point .",
    "but , the situation is a bit more subtle .",
    "there is a hidden tacit modification of the equations .",
    "this is realized in ( [ espec1 ] ) by the replacement : @xmath317 for the @xmath0 case it is an identity for @xmath318 , but for @xmath319 it is not an identity anymore , but a nontrivial analytical continuation in @xmath255 .",
    "such an analytical continuation would require the exact determination of complicated sums of convolutions of the tba equations as functions of the energy .",
    "since this does not seem to be feasible in practice , we give such an alternative modification of the tba equations which preserves the infinite sum structure of the equations , but the sums will converge everywhere for @xmath320 except at the critical value @xmath321 .",
    "the basic idea of the modification comes from the sum representations of the @xmath283-function .",
    "the usual one converges for @xmath322 : @xmath323 but there is another representation which converges for @xmath324 : @xmath325 then the original tba equations are modified through their infinite sums by the replacements : @xmath326 where @xmath327 . taking into account the large @xmath53 behavior of all @xmath157 functions and all the kernels of the infinite sums of the tba equations ,",
    "the new representation will converge for @xmath328 .",
    "this slight modification of the tba equations might make it possible to go beyond the critical point and get solution of the tba equations with large @xmath49 asymptotics being in accordance with the ones used for the derivation of the equations .",
    "the conclusion of this heuristic argument is that to keep the expected for large @xmath49 , while other @xmath14-functions tend to constant . ]",
    "qualitative large @xmath49 behavior a nontrivial modification of the tba equations must be carried out , which might lead to complex energies .",
    "in this paper we studied the ground state energy of a pair of open strings stretching between a coincident @xmath2-brane anti-@xmath2-brane pair in @xmath3 of @xmath4 .",
    "the main motivation for the study is that string - theory predicts that the ground state of such a configuration becomes tachyonic for large values of the t hooft coupling @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the usual integrability based btba approach always give real energies for the ground state and it breaks down at latest when the energy gets close to the critical value : @xmath35 .",
    "this point was interpreted in @xcite as a transition point where the ground state becomes tachyonic .",
    "approaching this critical point the contribution of all the @xmath14-functions of the btba becomes quantitatively relevant , thus the numerical solution of the truncated btba equations can not give accurate results close to the critical point . to resolve this difficulty and get more accurate numerical results we transformed the previously proposed btba equations into finite component hnlie equations .",
    "the hnlie equations were solved at different values of @xmath34 and @xmath12 and the numerical results confirmed the earlier btba data .    during the numerical solution of the hnlie equations the usual iterative methods failed to converge ,",
    "this is why we worked out two numerical methods to reach convergence .",
    "the most effective one is , if one transforms the integral equations into discrete nonlinear algebraic equations and solves them by newton - method .",
    "the power of this method is demonstrated by the fact that it gives convergent results even if the numerical solution is not physically acceptable .",
    "unfortunately , in our numerical studies we could not get very close to the critical point , because new singularities entered the hnlie equations taking into account of which would have required an enormous amount of additional work .",

    "for the ground state of the @xmath0 state the critical point is right at @xmath37 and neither perturbative field theory computations nor the boundary lscher formula could provide a finite quantitative answer to the anomalous dimension . even in this special case the numerical solution of the hnlie equations was possible .",
    "the results showed that without an appropriate modification of the equations , they can not give physically acceptable results . in this case , it means that the solution of the dicretized problem can not be considered as a discretized solution of the continuous nonlinear integral equations .",
    "moreover the large rapidity behavior of the numerical solution is incompatible with the one assumed for the derivation of the equations .",
    "this phenomenon is analytically analyzed in the framework of btba and an idea is sketched to preserve the expected large rapidity behavior of the unknowns .",
