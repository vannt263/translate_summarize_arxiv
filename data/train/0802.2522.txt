    "over the past decade , our large - scale view of the universe has undergone a revolution .",
    "cosmologists have agreed on a standard model that matches a wide range of astronomical data ( eg .",
    "spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , this @xmath1cdm concordance model relies on three ingredients whose origin and nature are unknown : dark matter , dark energy and fundamental fields driving a period of inflation , during which density fluctuations are imprinted on the universe .",
    "all these elements of the model represent new aspects of fundamental physics , which can best be studied via astronomy .",
    "the nature of the dark energy , which now comprises the bulk of the mass - energy budget of the universe , will determine the ultimate fate of the universe and is among the deepest questions in physics .",
    "the most powerful tool that can be brought to bear on these problems is weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies ; this forms the core of the dune mission .",
    "gravitational deflection of light by intervening dark matter concentrations causes the images of background galaxies to acquire an additional ellipticity of order of a percent , which is correlated over scales of tens of arcminutes . measuring this signature probes the expansion history in two complementary ways : ( 1 ) geometrically , through the distance - redshift relation , and ( 2 ) dynamically , through the growth rate of density fluctuations in the universe .",
    "utilisation of these cosmological probes relies on the measurement of image shapes and redshifts for several billion galaxies .",
    "the measurement of galaxy shapes for weak lensing imposes tight requirements on the image quality which can only be met in the absence of atmospheric phase errors and in the thermally stable environment of space . for this number of galaxies",
    ", distances must be estimated using photometric redshifts , involving photometry measurements over a wide wavelength range in the visible and near - ir .",
    "the necessary visible galaxy colour data can be obtained from the ground , using current or upcoming instruments , complementing the unique image quality of space for the measurement of image distortions . however , at wavelengths beyond 1@xmath2 m , we require a wide nir survey to depths that are only achievable from space .    given the importance of the questions being addressed and to provide systematic cross - checks , dune will also measure baryon acoustic oscillations , the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , and galaxy cluster counts . combining these independent cosmological probes",
    ", dune will tackle the following questions : what are the dynamics of dark energy ?",
    "what are the physical characteristics of the dark matter ? what are the seeds of structure formation and how did structure grow ?",
    "is einstein s theory of general relativity the correct theory of gravity ?",
    "dune will combine its unique space - borne observation with existing and planned ground - based surveys , and hence increases the science return of the mission while limiting costs and risks .",
    "the panoramic visible and nir surveys required by dune s primary science goals will afford unequalled sensitivity and survey area for the study of galaxy evolution and its relationship with the distribution of the dark matter , the discovery of high redshift objects , and of the physical drivers of star formation .",
    "additional surveys at low galactic latitudes will provide a unique census of the galactic plane and earth - mass exoplanets at distances of 0.5 - 5 au from their host star using the microlensing technique .",
    "these dune surveys will provide a unique all - sky map in the visible and nir and thus complement other space missions such as planck , wmap , erosita , jwst , and wise .",
    "the following describes the science objectives , instrument concept and mission profile ( see table  [ table : summary ] for a baseline summary ) .",
    "a description of an earlier version of the mission without nir capability and developped during a cnes phase 0 study can be found in refregier et al 2006 and grange et al .",
    ".    .dune baseline summary [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     meeting the above cosmological objectives necessitates an extra - galactic all - sky survey ( dass - ex ) in the visible / nir with galaxies at a median redhift of @xmath3 . to this survey , will be added a shallower survey of the galactic plane ( dass - g ) which will complete the coverage to the full sky , as well as a medium - deep survey of 100 deg@xmath0 ( dune - md ) and a pencil beam microlensing survey for planets in the galactic bulge .",
    "focussed on the dark sector , dune will produce an invaluable broad survey legacy .",
    "dass will cover a 10000 times larger area than other optical / near - ir surveys of the same or better resolution , will be 4mag deeper than the gaia photometry and six times higher resolution than the sdss . in the infrared , dass - ex will be nearly 1000 times deeper ( in j ) than the all - sky 2mass survey with an effective search volume which will be 5000-fold that of the ukidds large area survey currently underway , and 500-fold that of the proposed vista hemisphere survey .",
    "it would take vista 8000 years to match dass - ex depth and 20,000 deg@xmath0 area coverage .",
    "dass - md will bridge the gap between dass - ex and expected jwst surveys .      while much progress has been made in understanding the formation of large scale structure ,",
    "there are still many problems in forming galaxies within this structure with the observed luminosity function and morphological properties .",
    "this is now a major problem in astronomy .",
    "obtaining deep high spatial resolution near - ir images will be central to the study galaxy morphology and clustering .",
    "a large area survey is required for rare but important events , such as the merger rate of very massive galaxies .",
    "dune will deliver this key capability .",
    "using dune s weak lensing maps , we will study the relationship between galaxy mass and light , the bias , by mapping the total mass density and the stellar mass and luminosity .",
    "galaxy clusters are the largest scale signposts of structure formation .",
    "while at present only a few massive clusters at @xmath4 are known , dune will find hundreds of virgo - cluster - mass objects at @xmath5 , and several thousand clusters of m=@xmath6m@xmath7 .",
    "the latter are the likely environments in which the peak of qso activity at @xmath8 takes place , and hold the empirical key to understanding the heyday of qso activity .    using the lyman - dropout technique in the near - ir",
    ", the dune - md survey will be able to detect the most luminous objects in the early universe ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 and up to @xmath12 at @xmath13 , for sfrs @xmath14m@xmath7/yr .",
    "it will also be able to detect significant numbers of high-@xmath15 quasars : up to @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and @xmath12 at @xmath18",
    ". these will be central to understanding the reionisation history of the universe .",
    "dune will also detect a very large number of strong lensing systems : about @xmath19 galaxy - galaxy lenses , @xmath12 galaxy - quasar lenses and 5000 strong lensing arcs in clusters ( see menegetthi et al .",
    "it is also estimated that several tens of galaxy - galaxy lenses will be _ double _ einstein rings ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2008 ) , which are powerful probes of the cosmological model as they simultaneously probe several redshifts .",
    "in addition , during the course of the dune - md survey ( over 6 months ) , we expect to detect @xmath20 type ia supernovae with redshifts up to @xmath21 and a comparable number of core collapse sne ( types ii and ib / c ) out to @xmath22 .",
    "this will lead to measurement of sn rates thus providing information on their progenitors and on the star formation history .",
    "dune is also primed for a breakthrough in galactic astronomy .",
    "dass - ex , complemented by the shallower survey of the galactic plane ( with @xmath23 ) will provide all - sky high resolution ( 0.23  in the wide red band , and 0.4  in yjh ) deep imaging of the stellar content of the galaxy , allowing the deepest detailed structural studies of the thin and thick disk components , the bulge / bar , and the galactic halo ( including halo stars in nearby galaxies such as m31 and m33 ) in bands which are relatively insensitive to dust in the milky way .",
    "dune will be little affected by extinction and will supersede by orders of magnitude all of the ongoing surveys in terms of angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "dune will thus enable the most comprehensive stellar census of late - type dwarfs and giants , brown dwarfs , he - rich white dwarfs , along with detailed structural studies , tidal streams and merger fragments .",
    "dune s sensitivity will also open up a new discovery space for rare stellar and low - temperature objects via its h - band imaging . currently , much of galactic structure studies are focussed on the halo . studying the galactic disk components",
    "requires the combination of spatial resolution ( crowding ) and dust - penetration ( h - band ) that dune can deliver .    beyond our milky way",
    ", dune will also yield the most detailed and sensitive survey of structure and substructure in nearby galaxies , especially of their outer boundaries , thus constraining their merger and accretion histories .",
    "the discovery of extrasolar planets is the most exciting development in astrophysics over the past decade , rivalled only by the discovery of the acceleration of the universe .",
    "space observations ( e.g. corot , kepler ) , supported by ground - based high - precision radial velocity surveys will probe low - mass planets ( down to @xmath24 ) .",
    "dune is also perfectly suited to trace the distribution of matter on very small scales those of the normally invisible extrasolar planets . using microlensing effect",
    ", dune can provide a statistical census of exoplanets in the galaxy with masses over @xmath25 from orbits of 0.5 au to free - floating objects .",
    "this includes analogues to all the solar system s planets except for mercury , as well as most planets predicted by planet formation theory .",
    "microlensing is the temporary magnification of a galactic bulge source star by the gravitational potential of an intervening lens star passing near the line of sight .",
    "a planet orbiting the lens star , will have an altered magnification , showing a brief flash or a dip in the observed light curve of the star(see fig .",
    "[ figc5 ] ) . because of atmospheric seeing ( limiting the monitoring to large source stars ) , and poor duty cycle even using networks , ground - based microlensing surveys are only able to detect a few to 15 @xmath26 planets in the vicinity of the einstein ring radius ( 2 - 3 au ) .",
    "the high angular resolution of dune , and the uninterrupted visibility and nir sensitivity afforded by space observations will provide detections of microlensing events using as sources g and k bulge dwarfs stars and therefore can detect planets down to @xmath27 from orbits of 0.5 au . moreover , there will be a very large number of transiting hot jupiters detected towards the galactic bulge as free ancillary science .",
    "a space - based microlensing survey is thus the only way to gain a comprehensive census and understanding of the nature of planetary systems and their host stars .",
    "we also underline that the planet search scales linearly with the surface of the focal plane and the duration of the experiment .",
    "there are two key elements to a high precision weak lensing survey : a large survey area to provide large statistics , and the control of systematic errors .",
    "figure [ fig : req ] shows that to reach our dark energy target ( 2% error on @xmath28 ) a survey of 20,000 square degrees with galaxies at @xmath29 is required .",
    "this result is based on detailed studies showing that , for a fixed observing time , the accuracy of all the cosmological parameters is highest for a wide rather than deep survey ( amara & refregier 2007a , 2007b ) .",
    "this required survey area drives the choice of a 1.2 m telescope and a combined visible / nir fov of 1 deg@xmath0 for the dune baseline .     as a function of weak lensing survey area ( in deg@xmath30 ) for several shape measurement systematic levels ( assuming 40 galaxies / amin@xmath31 with a median redshift @xmath32=1 ) .",

    "2007 ) : photometric redshift performance for a des - like ground survey with and without the dune nir bands ( j , h ) .",
    "the deep nir photometry , only achievable in space , results in a dramatic reduction of the photometric redshift errors and catastrophic failures which are needed for all the probes ( weak lensing , bao , cc , isw).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0%,height=188 ] as a function of weak lensing survey area ( in deg@xmath30 ) for several shape measurement systematic levels ( assuming 40 galaxies / amin@xmath31 with a median redshift @xmath32=1 ) .",

    "current measurements have a residual shear systematics variance of @xmath34 , as indicated with both the results of the stepii program and the scatter in measured value of @xmath35 .",
    "this level of systematics is comparable to the statistical errors for surveys that cover a few tens of square degree ( fig .",
    "[ fig : req ] ) . as seen on the figure , to reach dune s dark energy targets",
    ", the systematics must be at the level of @xmath36 , 100 times better than the current level ( see amara & refregier 2007b for details ) . while ground based surveys may improve their systematics control , reaching",
    "this level will be an extreme challenge .",
    "one ultimate limit arises from the finite information contained in the stars used to calibrate the psf , due to noise and pixelisation .",
    "simulations by paulin - henriksson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) show that , to reach our systematic targets , the psf must remain constant ( within a tolerance of 0.1% ) over 50 arcmin@xmath31 ( which corresponds to @xmath37 stars ) .",
    "while this is prohibitive from the ground , we have demonstrated during a cnes phase 0 study ( refregier et al .",
    "2006 ) , that with the careful design of the instrument , this can be achieved from space .",
    "in addition to shape measurements , wide area imagining surveys use photometric information to measure the redshift of galaxies in the images .",
    "accurate measurements of the photometric redshifts require the addition of nir photometry ( an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : req ] , right panel , and also abdalla et al .",
    "such depths in the nir can not be achieved from the ground over wide area surveys and can only be done from space .    to achieve the scientific goals listed in section [ section2 ]",
    ", dune will perform four surveys detailed in the following and in table [ tablec5 ] .      to measure dark energy to the required precision",
    ", we need to make measurements over the entire extra - galactic sky to a depth which yields 40 gal / arcmin@xmath31 useful for lensing with a median redshift @xmath38 .",
    "this can be achieved with a survey ( dass - ex ) that has ab - magnitude limit of 24.5 ( 10@xmath39 extended source ) in a broad red visible filter ( r+i+z ) .",
    "based on the fact that dune focuses on observations that can not be obtained from the ground , the wide survey relies on two unique factors that are enabled by space : image quality in the visible and nir photometry .",
    "central to shape measurements for weak lensing the psf of dune needs to be sampled better than 2 - 2.5 pixels per fwhm ( paulin - henriksson et al .",
    "2008 ) , to be constant over 50 stars around each galaxy ( within a tolerance of @xmath40 in shape parameters ) , and to have a wavelength dependence which can be calibrated .",
    "accurate measurement of the redshift of distant galaxies ( @xmath3 ) requires photometry in the nir where galaxies have a distinctive feature ( the 4000@xmath41 break ) .",
    "deep nir photometry requires space observations .",
    "the bands y , j and h are the perfect synergy for ground based survey complement ( see abdalla et al .",
    "2007 for discussion ) , as recommended by the eso / esa working group on fundamental cosmology ( peacock et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we propose to allocate six months to a medium deep survey ( dune - md ) with an area of 100 deg@xmath31 to magnitudes of 26 in y , j and h , located at the n and s ecliptic poles .",
    "this survey can be used to calibrate dune during the mission , by constructing it from a stack of @xmath42 sub - images too achieve the required depths .",
    "dune will also perform a wide galactic survey ( dass - g ) that will complement the 4@xmath43 coverage of the sky and a microlensing survey ( dune - ml ) .",
    "both surveys require short exposures .",
    "together with the dass - ex , these surveys need good image quality with low level of stray light .",

    "the mission design of dune is driven by the need for the stability of the psf and large sky coverage .",
    "psf stability puts stringent requirements on pointing and thermal stability during the observation time .",
    "the 20,000 square degrees of dass - ex demands high operational efficiency , which can be achieved using a drift scanning mode ( or time delay integration , tdi , mode ) for the ccds in the visible focal plane .",
    "tdi mode necessitates the use of a counter - scanning mirror to stabilize the image in the nir focal plane channel .",
    "the baseline for dune is a geosynchronous earth orbit ( geo ) , with a low inclination and altitude close to a standard geostationary orbit .",
    "based on phase 0 cnes study , this solution was chosen to meet both the high science telemetry needs and the spacecraft low perturbation requirements .",
    "this orbit also provides substantial launch flexibility , and simplifies the ground segment .    as for the psf size and sampling requirements , a baseline figure for the line - of - sight stability is 0.5 pixel ( smearing mtf @xmath50 at cut - off frequency ) , with the stability budget to be shared between the telescope thermal stability ( 0.35 pixel ) and the attitude orbit control system ( aocs ) ( 0.35 pixel ) .",
    "this implies a line - of - sight stability better than 0.2 @xmath2rad over 375 sec ( the integration time across one ccd ) .",
    "this stringent requirement calls for a minimalization of external perturbations which mainly consist of solar radiation pressure and gravity gradient torques .",
    "a gravitational torque of 20 @xmath2 nm is acceptable , and requires an orbit altitude of at least 25,000 km .",
    "the attitude and orbit control design is based on proportional actuators .",
    "a stable thermal environment is requested for the payload ( @xmath51 variation over 375sec ) , hence mission design requires a permanent cold face for the focal plane radiators and an orbit that minimizes heat load from the earth .",
    "this could be achieved by having the whole payload in a regulated temperature cavity .    a primary driver for the geo orbit choice is the high data rate  the orbit must be close enough to earth to facilitate the transmission of the high amount of data produced by the payload every day ( about 1.5  tbits ) given existing ground network facilities , while minimizing communication downlink time during which science observations can not be made ( with a fixed antenna ) .",
    "the effects of the radiation environment at geo , for both ccd bulk damage induced by solar protons and false detections induced by electrons with realistic shielding , is considered acceptable .",
    "however , dune specific radiation tests on ccd sensors will be required as an early development for confirming the measurement robustness to proton induced damage . a high elliptical orbit ( heo )",
    "operating beyond the radiation belt is an alternative in case electron radiation or thermal constraints prevent the use of geo .",
    "the payload for dune is a passively cooled 1.2 m diameter korsch - like three - mirror telescope with two focal planes , visible and nir covering 1 square degree .",
    "figure  [ fig:4.1 ] provides an overview of the payload . the payload module design uses silicon carbide ( sic ) technology for the telescope optics and structure .",
    "this provides low mass , high stability , low sensitivity to radiation and the ability to operate the entire instrument at cold temperature , typically below 170 k , which will be important for cooling the large focal planes .",
    "the two fpas , together with their passive cooling structures are isostatically mounted on the m1 baseplate .",
    "also part of the payload are the de - scan mirror mechanism for the nir channel and the additional payload data handling unit ( pdhu ) .          the telescope is a korsch - like @xmath52 three - mirror telescope . after the first two mirrors ,",
    "the optical bundle is folded just after passing the primary mirror ( m1 ) to reach the off - axis tertiary mirror . a dichroic element located near the exit pupil of the system",
    "provides the spectral separation of the visible and nir channels . for the nir ,",
    "the de - scan mechanism close to the dichroic filter allows for a largely symmetric configuration of both spectral channels .",
    "the whole instrument fits within a cylinder of 1.8 m diameter and 2.65 m length .",
    "the payload mass is approximately 500  kg , with 20% margin , and average / peak power estimates are 250/545  w.    simulations have shown that the overall wavefront error ( wfe ) can be contained within 50 nm r.m.s , compatible with the required resolution .",
    "distortion is limited to between 3 - 4@xmath2 m , introducing an 0.15@xmath2rad fixed ( hence accessible to calibration ) displacement in the object space .",
    "the need to have a calibration of the psf shape error better than 0.1 % over 50 arcmin@xmath31 leads to a thermal stability of @xmath53 mk over 375 s. slow variations of solar incidence angle on the sunshield for dune will not significantly perturb the payload performance , even for angles as large as 30 degrees .",

    "the physical size of the array is 466x233 mm which corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "each pixel is 0.102 arcsec , so that the psf is well sampled in each direction over approximately 2.2 pixels , including all contributions .",
    "the vfp operates in the red band from 550 - 920 nm .",
    "this bandpass is produced by the dichroic .",
    "the ccds are 4-phase devices , so they can be clocked in @xmath55 pixel steps .",
    "the exposure duration on each ccd is 375s , permitting a slow readout rate and minimising readout noise . combining 4 rows of ccds will then provide a total exposure time of 1500s .",
    "the vfp will be used by the spacecraft in a closed - loop system to ensure that the scan rate and tdi clocking are synchronised .",
    "the two pairs of aocs ccds provide two speed measurements on relatively bright stars ( v @xmath56 ) .",
    "the dune vfp is largely a self - calibrating instrument . for the shape measurements , stars of the appropriate magnitude will allow the psf to be monitored for each ccd including the effects of optical distortion and detector alignment",
    "radiation - induced charge transfer inefficiency will modify the psf and will also be self - calibrated in orbit .",
    "the nir fpa consists of a 5 x 12 mosaic of 60 hawaii 2rg detector arrays from teledyne , nir bandpass filters for the wavelength bands y , j , and h , the mechanical support structure , and the detector readout and signal processing electronics ( see figure  [ fig:4.3 ] ) .",

    "the total integration time of 1500 s for the @xmath59 high field is split among five rows and 3 wavelengths bands along the scan direction .",
    "the effective integration times are 600 s in j and h , and 300 s in y. for each array , the readout control , a / d conversion of the video output , and transfer of the digital data via a serial link is handled by the sidecar asic developed for jwst . to achieve the limiting magnitudes defined by the science requirements within these integration times , a minimum of 13 reads are required .",

    "the spacecraft driving requirements are : ( 1 ) passive cooling of both visible and nir focal planes below 170 k and 140 k , respectively ; ( 2 ) the psf stability requirement , which translates to line of sight ( los ) and payload thermal stability requirements ; and ( 3 ) the high science data rate .",
    "the spacecraft consists of a payload module ( plm ) that includes the instrument ( telescope hardware , focal plane assemblies and on board science data management ) and a service module ( svm ) .",

    ", the attitude is controlled using the mars express propulsion system .",
    "the attitude estimation is based on using two star trackers ( also used in science observing mode ) , six single - axis gyros and two sun sensors for monitoring dune pointing during manoeuvres with a typically accuracy better than 1 arcmin .",
    "the star signal collected in the instrument is spread on the focal plane assembly and transformed into a digital electrical signal which is transferred to the payload data handling unit ( pdhu ) , based on thales / alienaspace heritage .",

    "electrical power is generated by two solar arrays ( 2.7 m@xmath31 each ) , as used in the mars express and venus express esa spacecraft . the control of their orientation is based on the orientation of the whole spacecraft towards the sun .",
    "the panels are filled with asga cells .",
    "the rf architecture is divided into two parts with the tt&c system ( s - band ) plus a dedicated payload telemetry system ( x - band in the ees band ( earth exploration service ) .",
    "the allocated bandwidth for payload telemetry is 375 mhz and high rate transmitters already exist for this purpose . the x - band 155 mbits / s tmthd modulator can be reused from pleiades spacecraft .",
    "a single fixed hga of 30 cm diameter can be used ( re - used from venus express ) .",
    "the rf power required is 25 w , which also enables the re - use of the solid state power amplifier ( sspa ) from pleiades .",
    "the transmitted science data volume is estimated at 1.5 tbits per day .",
    "the baseline approach consists in storing the science data on board in the pdhu , then to downlink the data twice per day .",
    "this can be achieved naturally twice per orbit at 06h and 18h local time and using the rotation degree of freedom about the satellite - sun axis for orienting the antenna towards the ground station .",
    "the total transmission duration is less than 3 hours .",
    "the spacecraft attitude variation during transmission is less than 30 deg ( including aocs margins ) .",
    "20 kg hydrazine propellant budget is required . in case",
    "the operational orbit would change to heo , a dual frequency ( s - band + x - band ) 35 m esoc antenna could fit with the mission needs , with in an increased hga diameter ( 70 cm ) .",
    "the required power on the geo orbit is 1055 w. the sizing case is the science mode after eclipse with battery charging .",
    "electrical power is generated by the two solar arrays of 2.7 m@xmath31 each . with a @xmath62 solar angle ,",
    "the solar array can generate up to 1150 w at the end of its life .",
    "the battery has been sized in a preliminary approach for the eclipse case ( 64 ah need ) .",
    "the dune operational scenario follows the lines of a survey - type project .",
    "the satellite will operate autonomously except for defined ground contact periods during which housekeeping and science telemetry will be downlinked , and the commands needed to control spacecraft and payload will be uploaded .",
    "the dune processing pipeline is inspired by the terapix pipeline used for the cfht legacy survey .",
    "the total amount of science image data expected from dune is @xmath65 terapixels ( tpx ) : 150tpx from the wide , 120tpx for 3 months of the microlensing survey , 60tpx for the 3 months of the galactic plane survey , and 40tpx for 6 months",
    "deep survey . based on previous experience",
    ", we estimate an equal amount of calibration data ( flat fields , dark frames , etc . )",
    "will be taken over the course of the mission .",
    "this corresponds to 740 tb , roughly 20 times the amount of science data for cfht during 2003 - 2007 .",
    "there are four main activities necessary for the data processing , handling , and data organisation of the dune surveys :    1 .",
    "software development : image and catalogue processing , quality control , image and catalogue handling tools , pipeline development , survey monitoring , data archiving and distribution , numerical simulations , image simulations ; 2 .",
    "processing operation : running the pipeline , quality control and quality assessment operation and versioning , pipeline / software / database update and maintenance ; 3 .",
    "data archiving and data distribution : data and meta - data products and product description , public user interface , external data ( non - dune ) archiving and distribution , public outreach ; 4 .",
    "computing resources : data storage , cluster architecture , grid technology .",
    "esa s planck mission will bring unprecedented precision to the measurement of the high redshift universe .",
    "this will leave the dark energy dominated low redshift universe as the next frontier in high precision cosmology .",
    "constraints from the radiation perturbation in the high redshift cmb , probed by planck , combined with density perturbations at low redshifts , probed by dune , will form a complete set for testing all sectors of the cosmological model . in this respect ,",
    "a dune+planck programme can be seen as the next significant step in testing , and thus challenging , the standard model of cosmology .",
    "table [ tablec2 ] illustrates just how precise the constraints on theory are expected to be : dune will offer high potential for ground - breaking discoveries of new physics , from dark energy to dark matter , initial conditions and the law of gravity .",
    "our understanding of the universe will be fundamentally altered in a post - dune era , with esa s science programmes at the forefront of these discoveries .",
    "as described above , the science goals of dune go far beyond the measurement of dark energy .",
    "it is a mission which : ( i ) measures both effects of dark energy ( i.e. the expansion history of the universe and the growth of structure ) by using weak lensing as the central probe ; ( ii ) places this high precision measurement of dark energy within a broader framework of high precision cosmology by constraining all sectors of the standard cosmology model ( dark matter , initial conditions and einstein gravity ) ; ( iii ) through a collection of unique legacy surveys is able to push the frontiers of the understanding of galaxy evolution and the physics of the local group ; and finally ( iv ) is able to obtain information on some of the lowest masses astronomy extrasolar planets , which could contain mirror earths .",
