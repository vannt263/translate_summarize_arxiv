    "the origin of research into quantum correlation , or more precisely , quantum entanglement can date back to the epr paper @xcite in 1935 , and nowadays it is no doubt that quantum entanglement is one of the most significant concepts in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it has already been recognized as the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and utilized as a crucial resource for communication and computation .",
    "however , entanglement should not be viewed as the unique measure of quantum correlations since there exist other types of nonclassical correlations which are not captured by entanglement .",
    "recently many authors have proposed a variety of computable measures to characterize quantum correlations in the composite states : quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite , geometric discord ( gd ) @xcite , measure - induced disturbance ( mid ) @xcite , measure - induced nonlocality ( min ) @xcite , ameliorated mid @xcite and so on .",
    "within such a quantum - classical framework , a great deal of concern has been raised by quantum discord and discord - like correlation measures in the past few years ( for review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , as an important application in quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite , entanglement can be exploited to determine the critical points ( cp ) for spin chains at zero temperature @xcite . meanwhile , since quantum discord ( and other discord - like measures ) is introduced as an information - theoretical tool to qualify and quantify quantum correlations , it is natural for us to clarify the role played by quantum discord in qpt .",
    "several studies concerning such a relationship have already appeared in ref .",
    "these recent observations demonstrate that the cp information provided by qd is just in agreement with that of entanglement , and even at finite temperature qd still works fine @xcite .    instead of resorting to two - point spin - spin correlation functions , which is usually done in most previous literature , quantum renormalization group ( qrg ) method @xcite",
    "is introduced to investigate the quantum information properties of critical systems .",
    "invoking such a method , surveys regarding ising and heisenberg models have been carried out by several works @xcite and it has been shown that implementation of qrg method is valuable in detecting the nonanalytic behavior of entanglement ( concurrence ) and the scaling behavior in the vicinity of cps . nevertheless , as mentioned above ,",
    "entanglement is not sufficient to account for all the correlation contained in quantum systems , so this motivates us to apply other correlation witnesses to study their dynamic behaviors combining with qrg method . to serve as a further comparison",
    ", the violation of bell inequalities @xcite is also taken into consideration .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii and sec .",
    "iii , we investigate one dimensional anisotropic xxz model and xy model respectively , using several kinds of correlation indicators under the method of qrg . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the scaling behavior of these quantifiers when close to cps .",
    "v is devoted to the discussion and conclusion .",
    "finally , some technical points are clarified in the appendix .",
    "first , we recall the qrg method and its application in one dimensional anisotropic xxz model . in fact , renormalization group refers to a mathematical tool that allows systematic investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different distance scales .",
    "the key point to qrg scheme lies in reducing the effective degrees of freedom of the system through a recursive procedure until a mathematically tractable situation is reached .",
    "following kadanoff s approach ( the `` block - spin '' renormalization group ) , the ( one dimensional ) lattice is split into blocks .",
    "the hamiltonian of each block is diagonalized exactly to obtain the low - lying eigenstates ( project operator ) to construct the basis for renormalized hilbert space .",
    "finally the full hamiltonian is projected onto the renormalized space to achieve an effective hamiltonian @xmath1 . here",
    "we can summarize the qrg method as the following steps :    \\1 ) decomposing the hamiltonian into the intrablock and interblock parts : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the block hamiltonian , and the interblock interaction is denoted as @xmath4 .",

    "kargarian et al .",
    "introduced the notion of `` renormalization of concurrence '' @xcite , and they found that this notion truly captures the nonanalytic behavior of the derivative of entanglement ( concurrence ) close to the critical point . as a warmup , we first review the renormalization of entanglement in the one - dimensional anisotropic xxz model @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of spin 1/2 xxz model on a periodic chain of n sites is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is exchange constant , @xmath12 is the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 are standard pauli matrices at site @xmath15 .",
    "this model is known to be exactly solvable by bethe ansatz and critical ( gapless ) while @xmath16 .",
    "the ising regime is @xmath17 and a maximum of concurrence can be reached between two nearest - neighbouring spins at the transition point @xmath18 @xcite .    to construct a renormalized form for the hamiltonian ( [ xxz ] )",
    ", we shall choose a decomposition of three - site blocks .",
    "note that this is requisite in the sense that it is a guarantee of self - similarity after each iterative step .",
    "@xcite gives the degenerate ground states of the block hamiltonian as follows @xmath19 are the eigenstates of @xmath0 and @xmath20 then the effective hamiltonian of the renormalized chain can be cast into the form @xmath21 where the iterative relationship is @xmath22 the most important information given in the qrg method are its fixed points . by solving equation @xmath23 , we obtain the trivial fixed point @xmath24 and also the nontrivial fixed point @xmath18 .",
    "it is worth noticing that , as was stated previously , xxz model is critical for all @xmath16 while qrg method only indicates the single points . indeed ,",
    "if appropriate boundary terms are implemented in the qrg method , then it predicts correctly a line of critical models in the range @xmath16 @xcite .    in order to calculate quantum discord and other correlation quantities ,",

    "however , to our best knowledge , there is no study of analyzing other correlation witnesses beyond entanglement in qrg framework . in the below section",
    ", we will analytically derive these quantities in detail to see whether they can be proved really helpful in predicting critical phenomenon .",
    "quantum discord is introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite aiming to characterize all the nonclassical correlations present in a bipartite state .",
    "it originates from the inequivalence of two expressions of mutual information in the quantum realm .",
    "consider a composite bipartite system @xmath31 , the quantum mutual information is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the von neumann entropy , and @xmath34 denote the reduced density operator of subsystem a(b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if a complete set of von neumann measurements @xmath35 ( or more generally , povms ) performed on subsystem a , an alternative version of quantum mutual information conditioned on this measurement yields @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 . to eliminate the dependence on specific measurement ,",
    "one takes the optimization procedure to obtain @xmath39 which has been suggested by henderson and vedral @xcite as a measure to quantify the purely classical part of correlations . the discrepancy between the original quantum mutual information @xmath40 and the measurement - induced quantum mutual information @xmath41 is defined as the so called quantum discord @xmath42    now we are going to deal with the situation that we come across . the density matrix defined in eq .",

    "however , up to local unitary equivalence , we can assume @xmath44 and @xmath45 are also real and in fact there are only five independent parameters ( note that qd is invariant under local unitary transformations ) .",
    "alternatively , if we represent the x - state in bloch decomposition , then the five characterizing parameters can be expressed as @xmath46 except for some numerical evaluations for a restricted subset of two - qubit x states @xcite , ref .",

    "we will prove that mid is exactly equal to the qd measured by @xmath0 for general x - structured states .    in figure [ qd1 ]",

    "note that after enough iteration steps for @xmath67 , @xmath68 while for @xmath17 , @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , since mid is exactly equal to concurrence , mid can obviously exhibit a qpt at @xmath18 .     in terms of qrg iteration steps in the xxz model .",
    "]      in this subsection we calculate gd and min .",
    "recently , daki et al . introduced the following geometric measure of quantum discord based on the hilbert - schmidt norm @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the set of zero - discord states and @xmath72 is the square of hilbert - schmidt norm . for two - qubit case , a closed form of expression for geometric discord can be achieved @xmath73 where @xmath74 are components of the local bloch vector for subsystem a , @xmath75 are components of the correlation matrix , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath79 ( here the superscript t denotes transpose ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , luo and fu presented an equivalent but simplified version of the geometric discord @xcite @xmath80 where the minimum is over all von neumann measurements @xmath81 on subsystem a. intuitively , in some sense dual to gd , another measure quantifying nonlocal effect caused by locally invariant measurements was introduced luo and fu @xcite @xmath82 with an extra constraint that von neumann measurements @xmath81 do not disturb @xmath83 locally , which means @xmath84 .    for x state and its characterizing parameters defined in eqs .",
    "( [ parameter ] ) , we have @xmath85 and @xmath86 and gd of x state reads @xmath87 besides , using theorem 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , min can be obtained for two - qubit x states @xmath88 with @xmath89 . applying these formulas to the state ( [ matrix1 ] )",

    "the variation of gd and min versus @xmath12 has been plotted in figure [ gd1 ] .",
    "it is no surprise that they can indicate the precise location of the critical point @xmath18 since @xmath95 .     in terms of qrg iteration steps in the xxz model . ]",
    "quantum nonlocality , as revealed by the violation of bell - type inequalities , refers to many - system measurement correlations that can not be simulated by any local hidden variable theory .",
    "in particular , for two - qubit pure states , the presence of entanglement guarantees violation of a bell inequality ( gisin s theorem ) @xcite .",
    "however , for mixed stares the situation becomes more complicated @xcite .",
    "here we restrict ourself to the chsh inequality .",
    "the bell operator corresponding to chsh inequality can be formulated in the following form @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 are the unit vectors in @xmath101 , and @xmath102",
    ". then the well - known chsh inequality is expressed as @xmath103 according to the horodecki criterion @xcite , the maximum violation of chsh inequality is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 are the eigenvalues of @xmath107 .    as to x states ,",
    "the matrix @xmath108 is diagonal and @xmath109 .",
    "therefore the maximal violation of the chsh inequality for x states can be simplified to @xmath110 with @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the ( maximal ) bell violation of state ( [ matrix1 ] ) is obtained @xmath111     in terms of qrg iteration steps in the xxz model . ]",
    "the value of maximum bell violation under qrg iterations is displayed in figure [ bell1 ] .",
    "interestingly , we can observe that the block - block correlations never violate the chsh inequality , but still evidently exhibit a qpt . at the critical point @xmath18 , the ( maximum ) bell violation is a fixed nonzero constant @xmath112 , irrespective of the iterative steps .",
    "what s more , beyond the critical point , bell violation also develops two saturated values : one is @xmath113 for @xmath67 and one is @xmath114 for @xmath17 , which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of concurrence .",
    "in this section we embark on studying the relationship between the qpt and quantum correlation witnesses in the spin-1/2 xy model with the qrg method .",

    "the xy model reduces to the xx model for @xmath117 or the ising model for @xmath118 . in the parameter range @xmath119",
    ", it falls into the ising universality class . to implement the qrg method , we still choose three sites as a block . in ref .",

    "( 39 ) ) . the dynamic behavior of qd in each iteration step is analogous to that of concurrence , but not totally the same . at the critical point @xmath146 ,",
    "qd reaches a nonzero constant @xmath147 , which once again indicates that spin - fluid phase contains quantum correlations as already shown in xxz model .",
    "in contrast to qd , mid also shows the nonanalytic property , however , for @xmath148 and @xmath149 mid does not fall to zero but gets to another nonzero constant @xmath150 .      in section",
    "ii we have obtained the analytic formulas for gd , min and bell violation . employing eqs .",
    "( [ gdx ] ) , ( [ minx ] ) and ( [ bellx ] ) , the gd , min and bell violation for the state ( [ matrix2 ] ) are listed as follows ( in the derivation note that @xmath132 and @xmath136 correspond to @xmath134 and @xmath137 respectively ) @xmath151 here the bell violation versus @xmath130 changing for different iterations is depicted in figure [ bell2 ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that in xy model the block - block correlation is still not strong enough to violation the chsh inequality although bell violation displays the nonanalytic behavior at @xmath146 ( @xmath117 ) .     in terms of qrg iteration steps in the xy model . ]",
    "so far , we employ the qrg method to investigate the _ block - block correlations _ of one - dimensional xxz and xy spin models . as we have described in the qrg approach , the size of a large system ( @xmath152 ) can be effectively rescaled to three sites with the renormalized couplings of the @xmath153th rg iteration .",
    "therefore , the quantum correlations between the two renormalized sites represents the correlations between two parts of the system each containing @xmath154 sites effectively . in this sense",
    ", we can refer to these quantities considered in this work as block - block correlations .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the first derivative of all these correlation measures shows a nonanalytic behavior in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "furthermore , the scaling property of entanglement has also been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is related to the divergence of the correlation length as the critical point is approached .",
    ", versus the logarithm of chain size , @xmath155 , which is linear and displays a scaling behavior ( @xmath156 is the bell violation in the xy model ) . ]    aiming to compare with the previous results concerning entanglement , we explicitly show the nonanalytic phenomenon and scaling behavior of other correlation witnesses . here , we focus on the dynamic property of nonlocality , that is , the maximal violation of bell - chsh inequality , since our results display that quantum discord behaves more similarly to entanglement ( see figure [ qd1 ] and [ qd2 ] ) .",
    "first , we have analyzed the scaling behavior of @xmath157 versus the size of the system @xmath158 in the xy model where @xmath159 is the position of the minimum of @xmath160 .",
    "we have plotted @xmath161 versus @xmath155 in figure [ scale1 ] which shows a linear behavior .",
    "numerical calculation tells us that the exponent for this behavior is @xmath162 . as a companion",
    ", our analysis also reveals that the position of the minimum @xmath159 of @xmath160 gradually tends to the critical point @xmath163 , as shown in figure [ scale2 ] ( the numerical relation is @xmath164 ) .",
    "these results convince us that bell violation truly signify the criticality of the spin system .     in terms of system size @xmath158 where @xmath165 is the position of the minimum derivative of bell violation in the xy model . ]",
    "in this paper we have investigated the performance of various correlation measures in quantum phase transition , exploiting the quantum renormalization group method . in most previous literature along this line ,",
    "only entanglement ( concurrence ) has been utilized as an information - theoretic tool to evaluate the critical properties of the spin systems .",
    "however , it is now well known that entanglement can not account for all the aspects of quantum correlations , which in turn motivates us to clarify whether other correlations witnesses ( including bell - chsh violation ) are useful in such a circumstance .",
    "indeed , there are several points that deserves our attention : ( i ) the quantum discord and other discord - like measures turn out to be as good as entanglement to detect the quantum phase transition in the anisotropic xxz and xy models .",
    "nevertheless , it is apparent that the dynamic processes of these quantities are not totally similar with entanglement and even when concurrence vanishes there still exists some kind of quantum correlations which is not captured by entanglement .",
    "( ii ) interestingly , our result shows that chsh inequality can never be violated in the entire iteration procedure , which indicates block - block entanglement can not revealed by the chsh inequality .",
    "moreover , the nonanalytic and scaling behaviors of bell violation have been justified by numerical calculations .    on the other hand ,",
    "the two cases handled in this work can be regard as perfect examples to apply the qd algorithm raised in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the optimal measurements to achieve qd can be exactly determined .",
    "besides , we are convinced that the whole analysis in this paper can be extended to many other spin models , since the reduced density matrices are usually highly symmetric and can be casted into x - shaped states @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been reported that bell inequality is able to signal qpt and it can never be violated in the corresponding spin models @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the nearest - neighboring spin - spin correlation functions are invoked to compute the bell violation , which are usually complex and lengthy .",
    "however , we resort to the qrg framework and also illustrate no violation can be discovered in each iteration step , which implies some intrinsic feature of long - scale corrections .",
    "the connection between these observations will be attractive and may need further investigation .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that it might be interesting to apply the same approach to high - dimensional systems , where a straightforward numerical analysis could be performed for some measures of quantum correlations .",

    "<S> we have investigated quantum phase transition employing the quantum renormalization group ( qrg ) method while in most previous literature barely entanglement ( concurrence ) has been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is now well known that entanglement is not the only signature of quantum correlations and a variety of computable measures have been developed to characterize quantum correlations in the composite systems . as an illustration , </S>",
    "<S> two cases are elaborated : one dimensional anisotropic ( i ) xxz model and ( ii ) xy model , with various measures of quantum correlations , including quantum discord ( qd ) , geometric discord ( gd ) , measure - induced disturbance ( mid ) , measure - induced nonlocality ( min ) and violation of bell inequalities ( eg . chsh inequality ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have proved that all these correlation measures can effectively detect the quantum critical points associated with quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) after several iterations of the renormalization in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it is shown that some of their dynamical behaviors are not totally similar with entanglement and even when concurrence vanishes there still exists some kind of quantum correlations which is not captured by entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , chsh inequality can never be violated in the whole iteration procedure , which indicates block - block entanglement can not revealed by the chsh inequality . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the nonanalytic and scaling behaviors of bell violation have also been discussed in detail . as a byproduct </S>",
    "<S> , we verify that measure - induced disturbance is exactly equal to the quantum discord measured by @xmath0 for general x - structured states . </S>"
