    "_ swift _  also allowed the determination of the true orbital period @xmath43d @xcite , a rare instance , as orbital periods are generally found from all - sky monitor data .",
    "furthermore , since the outbursts of this source are periodic and regularly spaced , and a non negligible eccentricity is required to account for the observed low quiescent luminosity , these data led @xcite to propose the existence of a second wind component from the supergiant companion in addition to its normal symmetric polar wind .",
    "this equatorially enhanced wind component is probably clumpy , denser and slower than the polar one , and inclined with respect to the orbital plane ( to account for the narrowness of the outburst x - ray light curve ) .      in the wake of the success of the j11215 campaign , during the fall 2007 we selected 4 sfxts from the 8 known at the time , igr  j16479@xmath04514 , xte  j1739302 , igr  j17544@xmath02619 , and ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 ( hereon j16479 , j1739 , j17544 , and j1841 , respectively , the seed of our _ yearly sample _ , see table  [ swift10:tab : tab1 ] ) , and set to perform a systematic study @xcite with a year - long series of 12ks pointed observations with xrt . at the time , the sfxt binary periods were largely unknown and believed to be in excess of 10d ( see the current status in table  [ swift10:tab : tab1 ] , col .",

    "while the outbursts account for 3 and 5% of the exposure time , the most probable flux level at which a random observation will find these sources , when detected , can be retrieved from the peak of the dld , and this is of course a powerful tool to plan further observing campaigns , as is the distribution of detections along the orbital phase ( see fig .  6 of * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , generally larger idcs would be expected for longer orbital periods . naturally , the definition of duty cycle is strongly dependent on the luminosity assumed as lower limit for the calculation",
    ". therefore , we exploited the high sensitivity afforded by the xrt observations and defined an _",
    "xrt luminosity - based duty cycle _ ( xrtdc ) as the percentage of time the source spends above a given luminosity .",

    "figure  [ swift10:fig : porb_dc ] shows the xrtdc as a function of the orbital period with red stars marking the value at the integral sensitivity .",
    "no clear correlation is found between the orbital periods and any of the duty cycles .",
    "this implies that wide orbits are not characterized by low duty cycles , as the clumpy wind models would predict .",
    "an intrinsic mechanism instead seems to be more likely responsible for the observed variability in sfxts , i.e. , either the wind properties or the compact object properties .",
    "however , it is hard to justify the radically different wind properties in sfxts from those in classical systems with the same companion spectral type .",
    "therefore , in light of this lack of correlation with the orbital period and our finding distinct flare populations ( see sect .  [",

    "* cumulative luminosity distributions . * in sect .",
    "[ swift10:sec : dld ] and [ swift10:sec : dc ] we have shown that dlds and idcs can be used effectively to discriminate sfxts from classical systems , since the former are characterized by lower average luminosities . another way to examine",

    "in particular , @xcite explained them in terms of transitions across the magnetic and/or centrifugal barriers . in this scenario , the large dynamic range of sfxts ( about five decades )",
    "is achieved with a small variation of the mass loss rate ( e.g.  a factor of @xmath55 in fig .",

    "such increase would imply that , either the mass loss rate from the supergiant stars in sfxts changes abruptly on short time scales , or the local fluctuations in velocity and density of their winds are substantially larger than that of classical systems . in both cases , this would imply a fine tuning for the properties of the supergiant star winds in sfxts compared to other sgxbs . at present",
    ", there is no observational evidence that this should be the case , as discussed in @xcite .",
