    "generically , free energy estimators are strongly biased for finite sample sizes , such that the bias constitutes the main source of error of the estimates .",

    "recent research has shown that the isothermal free energy difference @xmath0 of two thermal equilibrium states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , both at the same temperature @xmath3 , can be determined by externally driven nonequilibrium processes connecting these two states . in particular , if we start the process with the initial thermal equilibrium state @xmath1 and perturb it towards @xmath2 by varying the control parameter according to a predefined protocol , the work @xmath4 applied to the system will be a fluctuating random variable distributed according to a probability density @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath7 are related to each other by crooks fluctuation theorem @xcite @xmath8 throughout the paper , all energies are understood to be measured in units of the thermal energy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the fluctuation theorem relates the equilibrium free energy difference @xmath11 to the nonequilibrium work fluctuations which permits calculation ( estimation ) of @xmath11 using samples of work - values measured either in only one direction ( _ one - sided _ estimation ) or in both directions ( _ two - sided _ estimation ) .",
    "the one - sided estimators rely on the jarzynski relation @xcite @xmath12 which is a direct consequence of eq .  , and the free energy is estimated by calculating the sample mean of the exponential work . in general , however , it is of great advantage to employ optimal two - sided estimation with bennett s acceptance ratio method @xcite , although one has to measure work - values in both directions .",
    "the work fluctuations necessarily allow for events which `` violate '' the second law of thermodynamics such that @xmath13 holds in forward direction and @xmath14 in reverse direction , and the accuracy of any free energy estimate solely based on knowledge of eq",
    ".   will strongly depend on the extend to which these events are observed .",
    "the fluctuation theorem indicates that such events will in general be exponentially rare ; at least , it yields the inequality @xmath15 @xcite , which states the second law in terms of the average work @xmath16 and @xmath17 in forward and reverse direction , respectively .",
    "reliable free energy calculations will become harder the larger the dissipated work @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the two directions is @xcite , i.e.  the farther from equilibrium the process is carried out , resulting in an increasing number @xmath20 of work values needed for a converging estimate of @xmath11 .",
    "this difficulty can also be expressed in terms of the overlap area @xmath21 of the work densities , which is just the sum of the probabilities @xmath22 and @xmath23 of observing second - law `` violating '' events in the two directions .",

    "the present paper develops a criterion for the convergence of two - sided estimation which relies on monitoring the value of a suitably bounded quantity @xmath25 , the convergence measure . as a key feature , the convergence measure @xmath25 checks if the relevant second - law `` violating '' events",
    "are observed sufficiently and in the right proportion for obtaining an accurate and precise estimate of @xmath11",
    ".    two - sided free energy estimation , i.e.  bennett s acceptance ratio method , incorporates a pair of samples of both directions : given a sample @xmath26 of @xmath27 forward work values , drawn independently from @xmath5 , together with a sample @xmath28 of @xmath29 reverse work values drawn from @xmath7 , the asymptotically optimal estimate @xmath30 of the free energy difference @xmath11 is the unique solution of @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the fraction of forward and reverse work values used , respectively , @xmath34 with the total sample size @xmath35 .",
    "originally found by bennett @xcite in the context of free energy perturbation @xcite , with `` work '' being simply an energy difference , the two - sided estimator was generalized by crooks @xcite to actual work of nonequilibrium finite time processes .",
    "we note that the two - sided estimator has remarkably good properties @xcite .",
    "although in general biased for small sample sizes @xmath20 , the bias @xmath36 asymptotically vanishes for @xmath37 , and the estimator is the one with least mean square error ( viz .",

    "if we do not know whether the large @xmath20 limit is reached , we can not state a reliable confidence interval of the free energy estimate : a problem which encounters frequently within free energy calculations is that the estimates `` converge '' towards a stable plateau .",
    "while the sample variance can become small , it remains unclear whether the reached plateau represents the correct value of @xmath11 .",
    "possibly , the found plateau is subject to some large bias , i.e.  far off the correct value .",
    "a typical situation is displayed in fig .",

    "moreover , this happens almost simultaneously with the convergence of @xmath30 to @xmath11 .",
    "the procedure is as follows : while drawing an increasing number of work values in both directions ( with fixed fraction @xmath32 of forward draws ) , successive estimates @xmath30 and corresponding values of @xmath25 , based on the present samples of work , are calculated .",
    "the values of @xmath25 are displayed graphically in dependence of @xmath20 , preferably on a log - scale .",
    "then the typical situation observed is that @xmath25 is close to it s upper bound for small sample sizes @xmath58 , which indicates lack of `` rare events '' which are required in the averages of eq .",
    "( i.e.  those events which `` violate '' the second law ) .",
    "once @xmath20 becomes comparable to @xmath59 , single observations of rare events happen and change the value of @xmath30 and @xmath25 rapidly . in this regime of @xmath20 , rare events are likely to be observed either disproportionally often or seldom , resulting in strong fluctuations of @xmath25 around zero .",
    "this indicates the transition region to the large @xmath20 limit . finally , for some @xmath60",

    "we introduce a model for the bias of two - sided free energy estimation as follows . assuming a `` semi - large '' @xmath35 , the _ effective _ behavior of the estimator for fixed @xmath27 and @xmath29 is modeled by substituting the sample averages appearing in the estimator with ensemble averages , however truncated at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively : @xmath69 thereby , the cut - off values @xmath70 are thought fixed ( only depending on @xmath27 and @xmath29 ) and the expectation @xmath71 is understood to be the unique root of eq .  , thus being a function of the cut - off values @xmath70 , @xmath72 .    in order to elaborate the implications of this model , we rewrite eq .   with the use of the fluctuation theorem such that the integrands are equal , @xmath73 and consider two special cases :    1 .",

    "in essence , @xmath71 is shifted away from @xmath11 towards the insufficiently sampled density . in general , when none of the densities is sampled sufficiently , the bias will be a trade off between the two cases .    qualitatively , from the neglected tails model",
    ", we find the main source of bias resulting from a different convergence behavior of forward and reverse estimates of @xmath42 .",
    "the task of the next section will be to develop a quantitative measure of convergence .",
    "in order to check convergence , we propose a measure which relies on a consistency check of estimates based on first and second moments of the fermi functions that appear in the two - sided estimator . in a recent study @xcite",

    "we will assume that the densities @xmath77 and @xmath78 have the same support .",
    "it was discussed in the preceding section that the large @xmath20 limit is reached and hence the bias of two - sided estimation vanishes if the overlap @xmath42 is ( in average ) correctly estimated from both sides , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . defining the complementary fermi functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( for given @xmath32 ) with @xmath81 such that @xmath82 and @xmath83 holds .",

    "@xmath94 thereby , the estimates @xmath30 , @xmath47 , and @xmath93 , are understood to be calculated with the same pair of samples @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "the relative difference of this comparison results in the definition of the convergence measure , @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",

    "for the same reason , generically @xmath101 will hold , since @xmath102 holds for @xmath103 and similar @xmath104 for @xmath105 . therefore , @xmath25 is typically positive for small @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath20 is so small that _ all _ work values of the forward sample are larger than @xmath30 and all work values of the reverse sample are smaller than @xmath30 , then @xmath93 becomes much smaller than @xmath47 , resulting in @xmath106 .    analytic insight into the behavior of @xmath25 for small @xmath20 results from the fact that @xmath107 for any set @xmath108 of positive numbers @xmath109 . using this in eq .   yields @xmath110 and @xmath111 this shows that as long as @xmath112 holds , @xmath25 is close to its upper bound @xmath113 . in particular , if @xmath76 and @xmath114 , then @xmath115 holds exactly .",

    "especially the `` rare '' events @xmath13 of forward direction are much more available than the rare events @xmath14 of reverse direction .",
    "hence , more or less typical events of one direction together with atypical events of the other direction are responsible for the behavior of the convergence measure . likewise if both densities increase with @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   more generally , the work densities are some kind of interpolation between the above two cases .",

    "for instance , if the forward and reverse work densities have different support or if they do not obey the fluctuation theorem at all .",
    "with respect to the exceptional case , the convergence measure fails to work , since it requires that the forward and reverse work densities have the same support and that the densities are related to each other via the fluctuation theorem .    in all other cases ,",
    "the convergence measure certainly will work and will show a similar behavior , regardless of the detailed nature of the densities .",
    "this can be explained as follows . in the preceding subsections , we have investigated exponential and gaussian work densities , two examples that differ in their very nature . while exponential work densities cover case number two , and gaussians cover case number one , they show the same characteristics of @xmath25 .",
    "this means that the characteristics of the convergence measure are insensitive to the individual nature of the work densities as long as they have the same support and obey the fluctuation theorem .    to this end , we want to point to some subtleties in the text of the actual paper . while the measure of convergence is robust with respect to the nature of work densities , some heuristic or pedagogic explanations in the text are written with regard to the typical case number one , where the overlap region is sampled by rare events , only .",
    "this concerns mainly sec .",

    "this concerns the passages where we speak about rare events . nevertheless , the main and essential statements are valid for all cases .",
    "the most important property of @xmath25 is its almost _ simultaneous _ convergence with the free energy estimator @xmath30 to an _  priori known _ value .",
    "this fact is used to develop a convergence criterion in the next section .",
    "elaborated the statistical properties of the convergence measure , we are finally interested in the convergence of a _ single _ free energy estimate .",

    "the characteristics of the convergence measure enable us to state : typically , if a is close to zero , @xmath30 has converged .",
    "deviations from the typical situation are possible .",
    "for instance , @xmath30 may not show such clear jumps , neither may @xmath25 .",
    "occasionally , @xmath30 and @xmath25 , may also fluctuate exceedingly strong .",
    "thus , a single value of @xmath25 close to zero does not guarantee convergence of the free energy estimate as can be seen from some few individual events in the scatter plot of fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] that fail a correct estimate while @xmath25 is close to zero .",
    "a single random realization may give rise to a fluctuation that brings @xmath25 close to zero by chance , a fact that needs to be distinguished from @xmath25 having converged to zero . the difference between random chance and convergence",
    "is revealed by increasing the sample size , since it is highly unlikely that @xmath25 stays close to zero by random .",
    "it is the _ behavior _ of @xmath25 with increasing @xmath20 , that needs to be taken into account in order to establish an equivalence between @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",

    "this behavior indicates that the important but rare events which trigger the convergence of the @xmath182 estimate are now sampled , but with strongly fluctuating relative frequency , which in specific cases causes the negative values of @xmath25 ( because of too many rare events ! ) .",
