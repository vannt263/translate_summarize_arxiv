    "rs oph is one of the well observed recurrent novae and characterized by a long orbital period of 460 days ( @xcite ) , a relatively short recurrence period of @xmath720 yrs , and a companion ( m - giant ) star underfilling the roche lobe but losing its mass by massive stellar winds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "historically , rs oph underwent five outbursts , in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 , and 1985 , with the light curves very similar each other ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latest 1985 outburst has been observed at all wave lengths from radio to x - rays ( e.g. , papers in the 1985 rs oph conference proceedings ed . by @xcite ) .",
    "although there had been intense debates on the mechanism of rs oph outbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , various observational aspects favor thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) models on a very massive white dwarf ( wd ) ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent summary ) .",
    "rapid decline rates of the light curves indicate a very massive wd close to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "kato ( 1991 ) has first calculated rs oph light curves for the wd masses of 1.33 , 1.35 , 1.36 and 1.37 @xmath8 and found that the light curve of the @xmath9 model is in better agreement with the observational light curve of rs oph than the other lower mass models .",
    "however , structures of bloated envelopes on white dwarfs have been drastically changed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) after the advent of the new opacity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we have been recalculating light curves of the recurrent novae and have again determined the mass , composition , and distance ( @xcite for t crb ; @xcite , 2000b for u sco ; @xcite for v394 cra ) .",
    "moreover , we have added new parts to kato s ( 1991 ) simple model in order to follow later stages of the light curves , i.e. , the irradiation effects of the red giant ( rg ) companion star and the accretion disk ( acdk ) . as a result ,",
    "much more reliable quantities are derived from the light curve fittings than kato s ones .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are one of the most luminous explosive events of stars .",
    "recently , sne ia have been used as good distance indicators which provide a promising tool for determining cosmological parameters because of their almost uniform maximum luminosities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these both groups derived the maximum luminosities ( @xmath10 ) of sne ia completely empirically from the shape of the light curve ( lcs ) of nearby sne ia , and assumed that the same @xmath10lcs relation holds for high red - shift sne ia . to be sure of any systematic biases , the physics of sne",
    "ia must be understood completely . by far ,",
    "one of the greatest problems facing sn ia theorists is the lack of a real progenitor ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) . finding a reliable progenitor is urgently required in sn ia research .",
    "recurrent novae are probably the best candidate for this target ( e.g. , starrfield , sparks , & truran 1985 ; hachisu et al . 1999b ; hachisu , kato , & nomoto 1999a ) .    in  2",
    ", we present our methods for calculating theoretical light curves based on the optically thick wind theory developed by kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) .",
    "fitting results of the modeled light curves to the observations are shown in  3 .",
    "our results indicate that rs oph is a strong candidate for type ia supernovae .",
    "discussion follows in  4 especially for the distance to rs oph because we obtain a rather short distance of 0.6 kpc .",
    "in the tnr model , it has been established that the wd photosphere expands to a red giant size and then gradually shrinks to the original size of the wd in quiescent phase ( e.g. , @xmath11 for @xmath12 ) with the bolometric luminosity being kept near the eddington limit .",
    "the visual luminosity reaches its maximum at the maximum expansion of the photosphere and then gradually decays to the level in quiescent phase .",
    "accordingly , the main emitting region of the wd photosphere moves from visual into soft x - rays through ultraviolet .",
    "optically thick winds , which are blowing from the wd during the outbursts , play a key role in determining the nova duration because a large part of the envelope mass is blown in the outburst wind . the development of the wd photosphere can be followed by a unique sequence of steady - state , optically thick , wind solutions as shown by kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) .",
    "we have calculated such sequences of @xmath13 , 1.35 , 1.36 , 1.37 , and @xmath14 by assuming the hydrogen content @xmath15 , 0.50 , 0.35 , the helium content @xmath16 , 0.48 , 0.63 , respectively , and the metallicity @xmath17 ( solar metallicity ) and then , obtained the optical light curves . here , we have used the updated opal opacity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the envelope mass is decreasing due to wind mass loss ( @xmath18 ) and hydrogen shell burning ( @xmath19 ) , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass accretion rate of the wd and assumed to be @xmath22 yr@xmath4 during the outburst .",
    "the photospheric temperature @xmath23 , the photospheric radius @xmath24 , the photospheric velocity @xmath25 , the wind mass loss rate @xmath18 , and the nuclear burning rate @xmath19 are unique functions of the envelope mass @xmath26 . integrating equation ( [ dmdt_envelope_mass ] )",
    ", we can follow the development of the envelope mass @xmath26 and obtain various physical quantities of the wd envelope .",
    "the mass lost by the wind , @xmath27 , and the mass added to the helium layer of the wd , @xmath28 , are calculated from @xmath29    assuming a black - body photosphere , we have calculated the @xmath0-magnitude of the wd photosphere with a response function given by allen ( 1973 ) . for simplicity , a limb - darkening effect is neglected . by fitting with the observational points in the early 4 days of the superposed @xmath0 light curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the 1985 @xmath0 light curve , we have determined the wd mass of @xmath30 and the apparent distance modulus of @xmath31 as shown in figure [ all_mix_mass ] .",
    "the early 4 days @xmath0-magnitude is determined mainly by the bloated wd photosphere , and depends sensitively on the wd mass , but depends hardly on the hydrogen content , @xmath32 , the binary parameters such as the mass ratio , or the accretion disk shape , so that the wd mass determination itself is rather robust ( see also @xcite ) .    to reproduce the @xmath0 light curve in the late stage ( @xmath33100 days after the optical maximum ) , we have to include the contributions of the irradiated rg and the irradiated acdk . as suggested by dobrzycka et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we have assumed that the rg lies well within the inner critical roche lobe , i.e. , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the rg component ( e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath36 is a numerical factor . here",
    ", we assume 50% efficiency of the irradiation ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the nonirradiated photospheric temperature of the rg is a parameter for fitting , and has been determined to be @xmath38 k for @xmath39 .",
    "the orbit of the companion star is assumed to be circular .",
    "the ephemeris for the inferior conjunction of the giant is 2,444,999.9@xmath40 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the light curves are calculated for six cases of the companion mass , i.e. , @xmath41 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 1.0 , and @xmath42 .",
    "since we obtain similar light curves for all of these six masses , we show here only the results for @xmath43 . in this case , the separation is @xmath44 , the effective radii of the inner critical roche lobes for the wd component and the rg component are @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 , then we have @xmath48 .",
    "we have also included the luminosity coming from the acdk irradiated by the wd photosphere when the accretion disk exists during the outburst . here , we assume 50% efficiency of the acdk irradiation ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the viscous heating is neglected because it is rather smaller than that of the irradiation effects .",
    "the temperature of the unheated surface of the acdk including the rim is assumed to be @xmath50 k. we have checked two other cases of @xmath51 and 0 k and have found no significant differences in the light curves .",
    "the shape of the acdk is assumed to be axisymmetric and approximated by @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the outer edge of the accretion disk , @xmath55 the height of the surface from the equatorial plane , @xmath56 the distance on the equatorial plane from the center of the wd , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are both numerical factors which should be determined by fitting .",
    "the power of @xmath59 is assumed to be @xmath60 from the standard disk model .",
    "we have checked the dependency of the light curves on the parameter @xmath59 by changing from @xmath60 to @xmath61 but can not found any significant differences when the disk rim is as small as @xmath620.05 .",
    "the early 4 days @xmath0 light curve can be reproduced with the wd mass of @xmath30 as already mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the late phase @xmath0 light curve ( @xmath33100 days after maximum ) indicates strong irradiations both of the acdk and of the rg .",
    "if we assume a lobe - filling rg companion ( @xmath63 ) , then the irradiation of the rg is too luminous to be compatible with the observational light curves . on the other hand , a smaller size of the rg such as @xmath39 ( @xmath64 )",
    "gives a reasonable fit with the observational one as shown in figure [ vmag1350va_fig2 ] .",
    "here , we assume the inclination angle of @xmath65 ( @xcite ) .    to fit the late phase light curve , we have finally adopted the disk parameters of @xmath66 and @xmath62 as shown in figure [ vmag1350va_fig2 ] . here",
    ", the thick and thin solid lines denote the cases of ( @xmath66 , @xmath62 ) and ( @xmath67 , @xmath62 ) , respectively .",
    "something between these two can roughly reproduce the light curve of the 1985 outburst but the case of ( @xmath66 , @xmath62 ) is much better to reproduce the superposed light curve given by rosino ( 1987 ) .",
    "we have also calculated uv light curves with a response function of 9113250  to fit the uv data ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ vmag1350va_fig3 ] shows three cases of uv light curves for @xmath68 , 0.50 , and 0.70 , with the parameters of @xmath66 and @xmath62 .",
    "the calculated uv light curves can reproduce well the uv observations for @xmath15 and the distance to rs oph of @xmath69 kpc .",
    "thus , we have obtained the absorption of @xmath70 for @xmath69 kpc .",
    "this absorption of @xmath71 is consistent with the color excess of @xmath72 ( @xcite ) because of @xmath73 , although this distance of @xmath74 kpc is not consistent with another estimation of 1.6 kpc from the hydrogen column density ( @xcite ) .",
    "the uv light curves depend hardly on the disk parameters of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , or @xmath59 when @xmath75 mainly because the uv light is coming from the innermost part of the acdk , but depend on the irradiation efficiency of @xmath76 .",
    "we have examined that the distance becomes 0.70 kpc for @xmath77 or becomes 0.50 kpc for @xmath78 .",
    "the envelope mass at the optical maximum is estimated to be @xmath79 , which is indicating a mass accretion rate of @xmath3 yr@xmath4 during the quiescent phase between the 1968 and the 1985 outbursts .",
    "about 90% of the envelope mass ( @xmath80 ) has been blown off in the optically thick wind and the residual 10% ( @xmath81 ) has been left and added to the helium layer of the wd .",
    "the residual mass itself depends on both the hydrogen content @xmath32 and the wd mass .",
    "it is roughly ranging from 7% ( @xmath15 ) to 14%(@xmath82 ) including ambiguities of the wd mass ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "therefore , the net mass increasing rate of the wd is @xmath6 yr@xmath4 , which meets the condition for type ia supernova explosion if the wd core consists of carbon and oxygen .",
    "thus , we conclude that rs oph is an immediate progenitor of type ia supernova if the donor is massive enough to supply fuel to the wd until the wd reaches @xmath84 for explosion ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ) .",
    "assuming a tilting accretion disk around the wd , hachisu & kato ( 1999 ) have reproduced theoretically the second peak of t crb outbursts .",
    "such a radiation induced , tilting disk instability sets in if the condition @xmath85 is satisfied ( @xcite ) . our estimated accretion rate of the wd in rs oph is about @xmath86 yr@xmath4 , which does not meet the above condition , so that we do not expect the radiation induced instability in rs oph system .",
    "thus we can explain the reason why a second peak as seen in t crb system does not appear in rs oph system .",
    "very soft x - rays were observed 251 days after the optical maximum in the 1985 outburst of rs oph ( @xcite ) .",
    "mason et al . estimated a black - body temperature of @xmath87 k , a total energy flux of @xmath88 erg  s@xmath89 kpc)@xmath90 for a hydrogen column density of @xmath91 cm@xmath4 , and concluded that these soft x - rays come from a wd photosphere with a steady hydrogen shell - burning .",
    "however , steady hydrogen shell - burning has stopped 122 days after the optical maximum in our model of @xmath15 and @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ vmag1350va_fig3 ] ) , thus indicating an accretion luminosity instead of hydrogen shell - burning . using the black - body temperature of @xmath94 k and the wd radius of 0.0039 @xmath95",
    ", we estimate a total luminosity of @xmath96 .",
    "this low luminosity corresponds to the accretion luminosity of @xmath97 yr@xmath4 , which is roughly consistent with our estimated value of @xmath86 yr@xmath4 .",
    "then , a rather short distance of 0.45 kpc to rs oph can be derived from @xmath98 kpc)@xmath90 .",
    "thus , our short distance of 0.6 kpc is consistent with the soft x - ray observation .",
    "moreover , the recent optical and ultraviolet observations also suggest 100600 @xmath99 for a hot component of rs oph ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - rays were also observed at quiescent phase ( @xcite ) , but the flux is too low to be compatible with the tnr model .",
    "one possible explanation is an absorption by the massive cool wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) from the rg component as suggested by anupama & mikoajewska ( 1999 ) .",
    "our ejected mass ( @xmath80 ) is consistent with the observed ejected mass of ( 1.21.8)@xmath100 estimated by bohigas et al .",
    "( 1989 ) except their distance of 1.62.0 kpc to rs oph .",
    "using their equation ( 8) and @xmath101 and @xmath102 km s@xmath4 , we obtain the cool wind mass of @xmath103 , indicating the wind mass loss rate from the rg of @xmath104 yr@xmath4 .",
    "it is reasonable that about one twentieth of the cool wind accretes to the wd ( e.g. , @xcite ) to power the tnr explosion .    hjellming et al .",
    "( 1986 ) estimated the distance to rs oph of @xmath105 kpc from h  i absorption line measurements , using the hydrogen column density of @xmath106 @xmath107 and the relation of @xmath108 @xmath107 k@xmath4 kpc@xmath4 together with @xmath109 k. if a large part of this hydrogen column density stems not from the galactic one but from the local one belonging to rs oph , the distance is overestimated .",
    "for example , in the direction of the recurrent nova u sco , kahabka et al . ( 1999 ) reported a hydrogen column density of ( 34)@xmath110 @xmath107 , which is much higher than the galactic one of @xmath111 @xmath107 . here",
    ", u sco is at least 2 kpc above the galactic plane ( @xmath112 ) . if rs oph is the same case as u sco , the distance of 1.6 kpc is an upper limit and a much shorter distance is possible .    we thank the anonymous referee for many critical comments that helped to improve the content of the manuscript",
