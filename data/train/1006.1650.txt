    "discovering the higgs boson is one of the main physics goals of the lhc program .",
    "while collider search strategies have been well developed for the standard model ( sm ) higgs , the presence of new light degrees of freedom can dramatically alter higgs phenomenology .",
    "for instance , in a class of models with an extended higgs sector , the higgs can decay via the cascade @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an on - shell pseudoscalar and @xmath6 is a sm state to which the pseudoscalar decays .",
    "when this decay dominates , the branching fractions into the standard discovery channels such as @xmath7 are very suppressed , and new lhc strategies have to be developed to discover the higgs .",
    "previous studies have considered the pseudoscalar decaying into @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a more challenging case is when the pseudoscalar decays into light hadronic final states , as is predicted in the `` buried higgs '' model  @xcite where the dominant decay is @xmath12 gluons .",
    "a further motivation to consider this particular decay is that it is less constrained by existing lep analyses and may allow a the higgs mass well below 115 gev @xcite .    here",
    "we will introduce powerful new jet substructure techniques which enable the lhc to discover a higgs whose dominant decay is to qcd - like jets via a light uncolored resonance .",
    "specifically , we will consider the decay @xmath13 where @xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath5 is a pseudoscalar with @xmath16 . at first sight",
    "discovering this higgs using its dominant decay mode seems hopeless because the dominant higgs production channels are swamped by overwhelming qcd backgrounds . to make progress , we follow the strategy pioneered by ref .  @xcite and consider the higgs in a _ boosted _ regime . by going to this extreme kinematical limit we are able to substantially reduce the background to our signal",
    "however , the backgrounds are still considerable , and whereas ref .  @xcite made use of @xmath17-tagging to push the boosted higgs into the discovery region , here the situation is more challenging .",
    "fortunately , these exotic higgs decays have three features which can distinguish them from qcd backgrounds : ( 1 ) @xmath18 furnishes an additional light scale , ( 2 ) the higgs decay is symmetric , as both @xmath5 s have equal mass , and ( 3 ) both the higgs and the @xmath5 s are uncolored",
    ". we will find that the key to success lies in employing jet substructure tools sensitive to these characteristics .",
    "we will use these tools to devise a set of cuts that allows us to obtain more than @xmath19 signal significance at the lhc with @xmath20 tev and @xmath21 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : model ] discusses a model illustrating the type of exotic higgs decay we wish to investigate . in sec .",
    "[ sec : substr ] , we will introduce jet substructure tools designed to find this higgs , which we will then employ in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] to study the higgs in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production channels .",
    "[ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "higgs decays into light jets occur in well - motivated theoretical frameworks . in the presence of a light pseudoscalar particle @xmath5 with cubic couplings to the higgs , the higgs can undergo the cascade decay @xmath12 partons .",
    "this cascade was shown to be the generic decay mode in a class of models where the higgs is a supersymmetric goldstone boson  @xcite , and is also possible in extensions of the mssm with an additional singlet superfield  @xcite .    in the model of @xcite the higgs boson",
    "@xmath22 has an effective derivative interaction with the pseudoscalar @xmath5 , _",
    "~ h ( _ a)^2 where @xmath23 is the electroweak scale , @xmath24 is the global symmetry breaking scale , and @xmath25 is a coefficient of order unity .",
    "as long as @xmath24 is not much larger than the electroweak scale the decay @xmath26 dominates over the standard @xmath27 mode .",
    "the pseudoscalar is not stable because it has yukawa couplings to the sm fermions , @xmath28 .",
    "the largest yukawa coupling is to the 3rd generation quarks , while it is suppressed for leptons and lighter quark generations .",
    "thus , for @xmath29 gev the pseudoscalar decays almost exclusively into bottom quarks , resulting in the @xmath30 cascade . for @xmath31 the structure of the pseudoscalar yukawa couplings",
    "means that the decay into two gluons via a loop of 3rd generation quarks dominates over tree level decays to ( e.g. ) @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "the net result is a @xmath34 cascade decay occurring with a @xmath35 branching fraction . for this decay mode ,",
    "the current limit on @xmath36 is only 86 gev assuming the higgs is produced with the sm cross section @xcite for simplicity and clarity of presentation , in this paper we assume a @xmath37 higgs branching fraction into four gluons .",
    "the production of buried higgses at the lhc proceeds through similar vertices as in the sm .",
    "we shall assume here that the higgs couples to the electroweak bosons and the top quarks with the same strength as in the sm , although in some models realizing the buried higgs scenario these couplings may again be slightly modified .",
    "a buried higgs is difficult to discover because its decay products are difficult to distinguish from ordinary qcd radiation . in the case at hand , because @xmath38 , the gluons from each @xmath5 are very collimated , and so an _ unboosted _ buried higgs will be resolved as two jets",
    ". this will be very difficult to distinguish from the enormous backgrounds from qcd radiation .",
    "the extreme kinematic configuration where the higgs has a large @xmath39 , and is thus resolved entirely in one jet , is far more difficult for background processes to mimic . in this regime ,",
    "the two jets from higgs decay are themselves collimated into a single fat jet with a characteristic substructure .",
    "we will consider two such boosted scenarios , @xmath40 ( adopting the basic kinematic cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath41 with a mildly boosted higgs .",
    "the first step of our analyses is to cluster our events into relatively large jets and identify a candidate boosted higgs jet .",
    "we then , along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , use a cleaning procedure to remove contamination from pileup and underlying event from the jet and place a cut on its mass . to make further progress we must look to the distinguishing features of the exotic decays .",
    "one characteristic feature of the signal is that the jets from decays of light pseudoscalars @xmath5 have small invariant masses , of order @xmath42 gev .",
    "this is clearly independent of the @xmath5 s @xmath39 , while the invariant mass of a qcd jet grows with @xmath39 : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 for gluon ( quark ) initiated jets @xcite . because we work in the boosted regime where the @xmath5 s have a large @xmath39",
    ", we expect the bulk of the qcd background subjets to have masses above 10 gev .",
    "thus , requiring that the average mass of the two hardest subjets be small ( throughout we will denote the @xmath45th hardest subjet as @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is an efficient way to separate signal from background .",
    "the signal events are also distinguished by the symmetry of their decay products : both subjets arise from particles of equal mass .",
    "this can be distinguished by a cut on _ mass democracy _ :",
    "= at the parton level @xmath48 at leading order , while for the background there is no reason for the qcd radiation to produce democratic jets .",
    "finally , signal and background events differ by their color structure @xcite . for signal events color",
    "is only seen very late in the higgs decay process : neither the higgs nor the @xmath5 s carry color charge qcd processes therefore only becomes operative only at the scale @xmath49 gev after the pseudoscalars decay into gluons .",
    "by contrast , the background jets are initiated by hard colored particles , which are color - connected to the rest of the event ; moreover , there is more phase space for qcd radiation .",
    "therefore , we expect that the background has more radiation inside the fat jet cone than the signal does .",
    "we can quantify this intuition using the flow variable = , which is motivated by the fact that the signal is unlikely to yield radiation aside from that constituting the two collimated @xmath5 s .",
    "we therefore expect the typical value of @xmath50 for background processes to be much larger than for the signal . before proceeding",
    ", we note that @xmath50 can be sensitive to very soft radiation , depending on the cut one uses .",
    "therefore , we employ @xmath50 with a threshold : @xmath51 and set @xmath52 for @xmath53 . other flow variables could be defined to further boost discovery of the buried higgs . in particular , since signal radiates less , a simple cut on the number of subjets above @xmath54 gev falling inside the fat jet cone adds more discriminating power .",
    "however we have not included this cut here because qcd predictions for the number of soft jets are not entirely reliable at the present stage .",
    "measuring the number of tracks emanating from the leading subjets could also efficiently separate signal from background @xcite .",

    "error bars show statistical errors.,title=\"fig : \" ]    here we apply the substructure tools developed above to two processes yielding a boosted higgs : @xmath40 and @xmath41 . before proceeding with the analysis",
    "we describe our monte carlo tools and assumptions .",
    "we generate all signal and background events for @xmath59 at tree level using ` madgraph v4 `  @xcite and shower them using ` pythia 6.4.21 `  @xcite .",
    "we incorporate underlying event and pile - up using pythia s `` dw '' tune and assuming a luminosity per bunch crossing of @xmath60 .",
    "we generated signal samples for @xmath61 gev and @xmath62 gev .",
    "our @xmath63 jets sample is matched out to two jets using the @xmath64-mlm matching procedure  @xcite ( our @xmath65 jets sample requires no matching as it is dominated by @xmath66 processes ) .",
    "jet clustering is performed using the anti-@xmath64 algorithm  @xcite as implemented in ` fastjet 2.3 `  @xcite . when constructing subjets our procedure is to re - cluster the constituents of a jet using anti-@xmath64 with a smaller radius , denoted @xmath67 .",
    "here we consider a boosted higgs recoiling against a vector boson as in ref .",
    "as the production rate for @xmath40 is larger than @xmath68 , and the branching ratio of @xmath69 into leptons is much larger than that of @xmath70 into leptons , we will restrict ourselves to the process @xmath71 where @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "our events are clustered using jet radii @xmath74 of 0.8 , 1.0 , and 1.2 for @xmath36 of 80 , 100 , and 120 @xmath75 , respectively . to force ourselves into the boosted region",
    "we will consider events with a jet of @xmath76 .",
    "the dominant background then is @xmath77 .",
    "as one can see in table  [ tab : cuteffichv ] , the initial backgrounds are horrendous . demanding that the average mass of the hardest two subjets ( using @xmath78 ) lie below @xmath79 and requiring the trimmed  @xcite mass of the jet ( using the trimming parameter @xmath80 ) lie within @xmath81 helps , but it is not sufficient for a higgs discovery .",
    "however , after cutting on the jet substructure variables @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath36 of 80 , 100 , and 120 @xmath75 , respectively , one finds a prominent signal , discoverable regardless of whether one uses @xmath84 or a more conservative @xmath85 .",
    "the higgs mass distribution after these cuts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reconmass ] .",

    "[ sec : vh ]    .cut efficiencies for a @xmath86 higgs in the @xmath40 channel using the procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : vh ] . at the end of the table",
    "we include results obtained using two different values of @xmath51 for @xmath50.[tab : cuteffichv ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "here we have introduced a set of jet substructure techniques designed to discover a higgs undergoing challenging exotic decays . remarkably , we found that these tools are sufficient to discover a higgs whose dominant decay is to four gluons in both @xmath87 and @xmath58 channels after @xmath3 . while the systematic errors in both the background cross sections and the color flow cuts will need to be carefully studied",
    ", the comfortable values of @xmath88 which we are able to obtain should ensure that discovery is possible .",
    "one further lesson is that the @xmath58 channel can be relatively more useful for a non - standard higgs than it is in the sm .",
    "we believe that similar techniques can be applied to boost the lhc discovery potential for a wider class of models where a light higgs boson undergoes complex decays , e.g. @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "these techniques demonstrate the potential for the lhc to probe qualitatively new scenarios of physics beyond the sm as new jet substructure tools are developed . one important point of our analysis is that a lot of discriminating power is contained in soft ( a few gev ) qcd radiation .",
    "further progress in detector sensitivity to soft radiation , as well as a better theoretical control over qcd predictions at the low invariant mass region of the spectrum could lead to further improvement in the discovery potential of non - standard higgs bosons , or indeed to other non - standard new physics .",
