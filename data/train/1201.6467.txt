    "<S> we study the orbital magnetism of graphene ribbon in the effective - mass approximation , to figure out the finite - size effect on the singular susceptibility known in the bulk limit . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the susceptibility at @xmath0 oscillates between diamagnetism and paramagnetism as a function of @xmath1 , in accordance with the subband structure formed by quantum confinement . in increasing @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , the oscillation rapidly disappears once the thermal broadening energy exceeds the subband spacing , and the susceptibility @xmath3 approaches the bulk limit i.e. , a thermally broadened diamagnetic peak centered at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the electric current supporting the diamagnetism is found to flow near the edge with a depth @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the band velocity , while at @xmath0 the current distribution spreads entirely in the sample reflecting the absence of the characteristic wavelength in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the result is applied to estimate the three - dimensional random - stacked multilayer graphene , where we show that the external magnetic field is significantly screened inside the sample in low temperatures , in a much stronger manner than in graphite . </S>"
