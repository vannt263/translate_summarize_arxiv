    "in recent years , adsorption of atoms and molecules in bundles of single - walled carbon nanotubes  @xcite ( swnt ) is attracting interests for both fundamental and applied scientists ,  @xcite ranging from investigations of quasi - one - dimensional phases to applications of gas storage .",
    "@xcite swnts are self - organized into a bundle with a two dimensional ( 2d ) triangular lattice structure .",
    "@xcite in this bundle there are three main adsorption sites : an inner cavity of swnt ( tube or t ) , an interstitial channel ( ic ) between three swnts , a groove separating two swnts on the external surface of the bundle [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : structure](a ) ] .",
    "@xcite for a small adsorbate , gas uptake may occur progressively on the three sites and finally covering the outside of the bundle as pressure is increased .",
    "experimentally , gas uptakes can be studied by measuring adsorption isotherms . a more direct method of studying the adsorption sites , particularly useful for the ic and tube sites , is a diffraction experiment and its structure analysis of the 2d triangular lattice .",
    "since the diffraction pattern is not affected by uptakes by impurities , such as graphite and nano - particles of graphite , the diffraction study provides complementary information to the adsorption isotherm .",
    "techniques of x - ray and neutron diffraction were used to demonstrate the triangular lattice of the bundles of swnt ,  @xcite and to measure the diameter distribution of swnt .",
    "@xcite powder diffraction patterns by bundles of swnt with several adsorbates have been studied to determine the adsorption sites for o@xmath0 and n@xmath0 ,  @xcite cd@xmath1 ,  @xcite ar ,  @xcite d@xmath0 ,  @xcite and i@xmath2 .  @xcite as pointed out in ref .  , intensity of the ( 10 ) reflection increases or decreases depending on adsorption at the ic or tube sites , respectively , being used as a simple experimental distinction .",
    "when internal structures of adsorbed atoms or molecules in the tube site are studied , entire powder diffraction patterns have to be analyzed more carefully . among a few examples of this kind , c@xmath3 and h@xmath0o molecules in swnt",
    "were shown to form interesting one - dimensional lattices in the inner cavity channel using x - ray powder diffraction .",
    "@xcite adsorption of iodine in swnt and its clustering in the tube and ic sites were studied using both x - ray and neutron powder diffraction .",
    "@xcite however the analyses of these powder diffraction patterns are in a primitive stage in comparison with recent elaborate techniques of the rietveld analyses for three dimensional ( 3d ) crystals .  @xcite the major difficulty for swnt is brought about by randomness existing in bundles which is not controlled even by recent preparation methods .",
    "a bundle consists of different swnts with numerous chiralities , which are only characterized by a radius distribution with an average @xmath4  and a width @xmath5  [ full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ] .",
    "in addition , radii of bundles in a sample vary in a typical range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "small diameter bundles give rise to large broadening of bragg peaks , which complicates the pattern fit method .",
    "the first purpose of the present work is to extend the previous simulation - type studies of powder diffraction for swnt  @xcite to a quantitative rietveld fit technique .",
    "we tried to provide a robust basis to this rietveld analysis , which will facilitate to extract maximal information of the structure of adsorbates . in discussing this analysis in detail ,",
    "it becomes clear that the powder diffraction patterns are more informative than previously expected .",
    "this leads us to another extension of the simulation studies , a possibility to exploit a maximum entropy method  @xcite ( mem ) for swnt .",
    "thus our second purpose is to formulate the mem for swnt , and to show its simplest application .",
    "this mem can reconstruct the density of carbon and adsorbates at the tube site without assuming any structure models , which can be a complementary method to the rietveld analysis , where a model structure is assumed from the beginning . in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to methodologies and to analyzing powder diffraction data of pristine swnt samples with no nominal adsorption , showing simple demonstrations of the rietveld analysis and mem .",
    "the raw soot of swnt was prepared by laser vaporization  @xcite of a carbon rod including ni and co catalysts , and then purified as previously reported .",

    "the sample of swnt was heated at @xmath8 100@xmath9c in an evacuated aluminum container .",
    "a neutron diffraction experiment was performed using the triple - axis spectrometer 4g - gptas installed at jrr-3 m jaeri ( tokai ) .",

    "<S> the structure of bundles of single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) has been refined by rietveld analysis using neutron and x - ray powder diffraction data . based on previous simulation studies of powder diffraction data of swnt and standard rietveld analyses , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a pattern fit technique for swnt which provides precise structure parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the present technique can be used with the maximum entropy method ( mem ) , which is complementary to the rietveld analysis . using the neutron diffraction data of pristine swnt </S>",
    "<S> , we have successfully reconstructed the density of carbon nuclei and zero density in the inner cavity of swnt by mem . </S>"
