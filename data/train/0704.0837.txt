    "<S> when charged particles collide with a vacuum bubble , they can radiate strong electromagnetic waves due to rapid deceleration . owing to the energy loss of the particles by this bremsstrahlung radiation </S>",
    "<S> , there is a non - negligible damping pressure acting on the bubble wall even when thermal equilibrium is maintained . in the non - relativistic region , this pressure is proportional to the velocity of the wall and could have influenced the bubble dynamics in the early universe .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been many studies on cosmological roles of first - order phase transitions , which proceed by nucleations and collisions of vacuum bubbles@xcite . for example , in electroweak baryogenesis models@xcite rapid bubble expansion can provide a non - equilibrium environment , which may result in asymmetry between matter and antimatter . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in some inflationary models@xcite , the speed of expanding vacuum bubbles determines how long the inflation period lasts . to understand the bubble kinematics in a hot plasma </S>",
    "<S> , it is important to study particle scatterings at a moving bubble wall . to calculate the velocity of electro - weak bubbles@xcite and the cp violating charge transport rate by the wall available for baryogenesis@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one should know the reaction force acting on the wall due to the scattered particles , such as quarks and gauge bosons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a supersymmetric model see , for example , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite )    at the first order cosmological phase transition </S>",
    "<S> , the false vacuum decays to the true vacuum , which has lower energy , by making a vacuum bubble . </S>",
    "<S> when it is created , the wall of the bubble is at rest . as the free energy difference between the inner and the outer parts of the bubble fuels the wall , the velocity of the wall increases to the light velocity unless there is a damping force . in the literature </S>",
    "<S> , it is generally believed that the non - trivial damping force is caused by a deviation of the particle population from a thermal equilibrium one . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the effect of bremsstrahlung radiations emitted by particles on the pressure acting on a bubble wall ( not necessary electroweak bubbles ) during cosmological first order phase transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to show that , contrary to the usual arguments , the radiation damping could give a non - negligible pressure even when the particles maintain thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> bremsstrahlung ( braking radiation ) is a radiation due to the acceleration or deceleration of a charged particle@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> entering a true vacuum through a bubble wall , particles interact with the wall and could acquire mass and be decelerated . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a fermion field @xmath0 can get mass through the well - known yukawa term @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a higgs field . at this time , if the particle is charged electromagnetically , it can radiate strong electromagnetic waves due to the deceleration . </S>",
    "<S> let us calculate the pressure from the scattering .    for simplicity , we assume a linear profile for the bubble wall , i.e. , @xmath3 when @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig.1 . ) and choose the coordinates of the rest frame of the bubble wall . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is good for the usual @xmath5 profile of the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation power of an accelerated particle is given by a relativistic version of the larmor s formula@xcite : =( ) ^2 , [ lamor ] where @xmath6 in the natural units ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 is the 3-momentum of a particle . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a situation where this classical description of bremsstrahlung is good enough . </S>",
    "<S> also , assuming that the wall is planar and parallel to the y - z plane , we can treat the bubble as a 1-dimensional one along the @xmath9-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the energy , momentum , and mass of the particle satisfy the usual relation e^2m^2(x)+^2(x ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote the x - component of the momentum ( @xmath10 ) as @xmath11 from now on . differentiating the above equation with time @xmath12 and using @xmath13 and @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , we get the force acting on the wall due to the particles = - , [ dkdt ] which is the starting point of the pressure calculation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we also consider the energy carried away by the radiation @xmath15 , then the total energy conserved is @xmath16 and the force and , hence , the pressure should be changed . from @xmath17 , we obtain + + ( ) ^2=0 , which has a solution for the force = . up to @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> , one can expand the square root term and obtain - - ( ) ^2 . </S>",
    "<S> [ dk ] the second term represents the radiation damping . </S>",
    "<S> then , the total pressure due to the collisions of the particles in the plasma is given by@xcite p=^_-dx , where @xmath19 is a distribution function of fermions and bosons , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> first , let us briefly review the well - known results without radiation damping . </S>",
    "<S> when the mean velocity of the plasma fluid @xmath20 relative to the wall ( or the negative of the bubble wall velocity relative to the fluid ) is zero , the first term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dk ] ) contributes p_1&=&^_- dx , + & = & f(m_0,t)-f(0,t ) , where @xmath21 is a free energy of @xmath2 at a temperature @xmath22 . when @xmath23 , the distribution function is changed to f[(e - vk)]=(e^(e - vk)1 ) ^-1 . here , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> however , using the fact that the phase factor @xmath25 is a lorentz invariant and changing the integration variable to @xmath26 and defining @xmath27 , one can find that the @xmath20 dependency of @xmath28 disappears @xcite . from this </S>",
    "<S> , it is generally believed that to get non - trivial pressure on the wall , one needs to consider a non - equilibrium deviation of @xmath29@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our work indicates this is not necessarily true for some phase transitions . to see this , </S>",
    "<S> consider the effect of the radiation ( the second term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dk ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath30 , the term contributes to the pressure p_2=2a^_- ( ) ^2 dx , + which also vanishes because the second integrand is an odd function of k. however , when @xmath23 , one can easily check that , due to the @xmath31 term , the @xmath20 dependency survives even under the change of the integration variable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this case , p_2 & = & 2a^_- ( ) ^2 dx . </S>",
    "<S> + & & 2 a^_- ( ) ^2 dx   i_2(x ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ p2 ]    to be more concrete , let us calculate an approximate value of the integration when @xmath32 for fermions . in this case , we can expand @xmath33\\simeq f(e)-v\\beta k f(e)[f(e)-1 ] = f(e)+v\\beta k f^{2}(e ) exp(-\\beta e)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the integration of the first term gives zero , and the second term contributes i_2=vf^2(e ) exp(-e ) because f^2(e ) exp(-e ) , to lowest oder in @xmath34 ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . therefore , for the wall described in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 the pressure by the radiation is [ p2approx ] p_2 v , which is comparable to the result of numerical integration of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p2 ] ) for @xmath35 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( during the numerical study it is useful to change the measure from @xmath36 to @xmath37 . ) </S>",
    "<S> this pressure is proportional to the wall velocity up to the moderately relativistic case and exists even when the system is in a thermal equilibrium . during the electroweak phase transition , </S>",
    "<S> a particle s electromagnetic charge is not definite , so the @xmath38 value in lamor s formula can not be a constant . in this paper , however , to perform a rough calculation , we have assumed that a is a constant during the phase transition . for illustration of high temperature effects on electric charges , now we consider a debye screening of electric charge by plasma during the phase transition , which is given by effective coupling @xmath39 , where we used averaged momentum @xmath40 and @xmath41 of order electron mass at the last approximation ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 42 ) of  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we obtain @xmath42 which is slightly smaller than the zero temperature value . </S>",
    "<S> we also plot the pressure with this @xmath38 value .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the pressure caused by the radiation damping ( eq . ( [ p2approx ] ) ) is of order @xmath43 , which is bigger than the pressure due to a departure from thermal equilibriums@xcite ( @xmath44)@xcite , and hence non - negligible . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath45 is the fine structure constant . note also that the power of bremsstrahlung due to bubble walls is much stronger ( @xmath43 ) than that of ordinary bremsstrahlung of electrons colliding with ions in a plasma ( @xmath46)@xcite . since the electroweak phase transition is a complicated phenomenon , by no means is our work a full calculation of the pressure acting on the electroweak bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to present a general idea that radiation damping ( although usually ignored in the many related works for bubble wall velocity calculations ) could give rise to significant frictional forces even in thermal equilibrium states at some cosmological phase transitions . to include the effects of other particles ( e.g. , gluon and w / z particles ) in our work , we need to modify larmor s formula by using some sort of group factor . even in this case , it is hardly probable that the pressure from the radiation damping from different gauge sectors exactly cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one can expect that a @xmath43 viscosity to survive . </S>",
    "<S> since bubbles are slow initially , they are supposed to be in a thermal equilibrium state initially . </S>",
    "<S> an ordinary calculation shows no friction at this time , but the radiation damping force exists in this stage , and hence , this pressure can significantly change the early evolution of the vacuum bubbles , and the nature of electroweak baryogenesis or inflationary cosmology .    </S>",
