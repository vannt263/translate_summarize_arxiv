    "_ low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) _ codes , combined with iterative _ belief - propagation ( bp ) _ decoding , have emerged in recent years as the most promising method of achieving the goal set by shannon @xcite in his landmark 1948 paper : to communicate reliably over a noisy transmission channel at a rate approaching channel capacity .",
    "indeed , many applications have recently adopted ldpc codes as industry standards - such as wireless lans ( ieee 802.11n ) , wimax ( ieee 802.16e ) , digital video broadcasting ( dvb - s2 ) , 10gbase - t ethernet ( ieee 802.3an ) , and the itu - t standard for networking over power lines , phone lines , and coaxial cable ( g.hn/g.9960 ) .",
    "the key feature that sets ldpc codes apart from other capacity approaching codes is that , with suboptimal iterative bp decoding , complexity grows only linearly with code block length , resulting in practically realizable decoder implementations for powerful ( long block length ) codes .",
    "( the decoding complexity of optimum _ maximum likelihood ( ml ) _ decoding , on the other hand , grows exponentially with block length , making it impractical for large block lengths . )",
    "_ ldpc block code ( ldpc - bc ) _ designs can be classified in two types : regular and irregular .",
    "_ regular _ codes , as originally proposed by gallager @xcite in 1962 , are _ asymptotically good _ in the sense that their _ minimum distance _ grows linearly with block length .",
    "this guarantees , with ml decoding , that the codes do not suffer from the _ error floor _ phenomenon , a flattening of the _ bit error rate ( ber ) _ curve that results in poor performance at high _ signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) _ , and similar behavior is observed with iterative bp decoding as well . however , the iterative decoding behavior of regular codes in the so - called _ waterfall _ , or moderate ber , region of the performance curve falls short of capacity , making them unsuitable for severely power - constrained applications , such as uplink cellular data transmission or digital satellite broadcasting systems , that must achieve the best possible performance at moderate bers . on the other hand , _ irregular _ codes , pioneered by luby et al .",
    "@xcite in 2001 , exhibit capacity approaching performance in the waterfall but are normally subject to an error floor , making them undesirable in applications , such as data storage and optical communication , that require very low decoded bers .",
    "typical performance characteristics of regular and irregular ldpc - bcs on an _ additive white gaussian noise channel ( awgnc ) _ are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldpcsketch ] , where the channel snr is expressed in terms of @xmath0 , the _ information bit signal - to - noise ratio_.        in this paper , we highlight a particularly exciting new class of ldpc codes , called _ spatially - coupled ldpc ( sc - ldpc ) _ codes , which promise robustly excellent performance over a broad range of channel conditions , including both the waterfall and error floor regions of the ber curve .",
    "we also show how sc - ldpc codes can be viewed as a type of _ ldpc convolutional code ( ldpc - cc ) _ , since spatial coupling is equivalent to introducing memory into the encoding process . in channel coding parlance ,",
    "the key feature of sc - ldpc codes that distinguishes them from standard ldpc codes is their ability to combine the best features of regular and irregular codes in a single design : ( 1 ) capacity approaching iterative decoding _",
    "_ thresholds _ _ , characteristic of optimized irregular codes , thus promising excellent performance in the waterfall , and ( 2 ) linear growth of minimum distance with block length , characteristic of regular codes , thus promising the elimination of an error floor .",
    "as will be discussed in more detail in section [ sec : scstructure ] , this is achieved by introducing a slight _ structured irregularity _ into the tanner graph representation of a regular ldpc code .",
    "an added feature of the sc - ldpc code design is that the resulting graph retains the essential implementation advantages associated with the structure of regular codes , compared to typical irregular designs .",
    "the research establishing the performance characteristics of sc - ldpc codes relies on ensemble average asymptotic methods , _",
    "i.e. _ , the capacity approaching thresholds and asymptotically good minimum distance behavior are shown to hold for typical members of sc - ldpc code ensembles as the block length tends to infinity .",
    "( following the lead of shannon , coding theorists often find it easier and more insightful to analyze the average asymptotic behavior of code ensembles than to determine the exact performance of specific codes . ) these research results are summarized in section [ sec : scstructure ] .",
    "section [ sec : scproblems ] discusses issues related to realizing the exceptional promise of sc - ldpc codes with specific code and decoder designs suitable for low - complexity implementation at block lengths typically employed in practice : 1 ) the use of high - throughput , parallel , pipeline decoding and 2 ) the use of _ sliding - window _ decoding strategies for reduced latency and computational complexity , and section [ sec : op ] contains a short summary of several open research problems .",

    "* members of an ldpc code ensemble that are _ quasi - cyclic _ ( qc ) are of particular interest to code designers ,",
    "since they can be encoded with low complexity using simple feedback shift - registers and their structure leads to efficiencies in decoder design .",
    "the practical advantages of qc - ldpc - bc designs also carry over to the design of qc - sc - ldpc codes",
    ". it should be noted , however , that once the qc constraint is applied , the asymptotic ensemble average properties noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : scstructure ] do not necessarily hold ( since we are now choosing a code from a restricted sub - ensemble ) , and particular qc - sc - ldpc codes must be carefully designed to insure good performance .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to provide a brief tutorial overview of the exciting new field of spatially coupled low - density parity - check codes .",
    "capacity approaching iterative decoding thresholds and asymptotically good minimum distance properties make these codes potentially very attractive for future industry standard applications .",
    "we traced the origins of sc - ldpc codes to the development of low - density parity - check convolutional codes in @xcite , we used a visually convenient protograph representation to describe their construction , we discussed several issues related to practical decoder implementations , and we summarized a few still remaining open research problems .    finally , it has recently been shown that the improved thresholds associated with spatial coupling apply generally regardless of the particular physical situation or communication channel ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "further , although space limitations do not allow us to provide details , we note that the concept of spatial coupling of a sequence of identical copies of a small structured graph ( a protograph ) is applicable to a wide variety of problems and has been shown to lead to improved system performance in areas as diverse as multiterminal source and channel coding , cooperative relaying , compressed sensing , secure communication , and statistical physics .",

    "<S> since the discovery of turbo codes 20 years ago and the subsequent re - discovery of low - density parity - check codes a few years later , the field of channel coding has experienced a number of major advances . up until that time , code designers were usually happy with performance that came within a few decibels of the shannon limit , primarily due to implementation complexity constraints , whereas the new coding techniques now allow performance within a small fraction of a decibel of capacity with modest encoding and decoding complexity . due to these significant improvements , </S>",
    "<S> coding standards in applications as varied as wireless mobile transmission , satellite tv , and deep space communication are being updated to incorporate the new techniques . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we review a particularly exciting new class of low - density parity - check codes , called spatially - coupled codes , which promise excellent performance over a broad range of channel conditions and decoded error rate requirements . </S>"
