    "the equality of the inertial and gravitational masses is being doubted all the time . and the equality of masses remains as puzzling as ever . however",
    ", the existing theories do not explain why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass , and then do not offer compelling reason for this empirical fact .",
    "the paper attempts to reason out why there exists the equality of masses in most cases , even in the electromagnetic field .",
    "some experiments for the equality of masses have been performed by l. etvs @xcite , h. potter @xcite , r. dicke @xcite , and v. braginsky @xcite , etc . and",
    "more precise experiments have been carried out by i. shapiro @xcite , k. nordtvedt @xcite , and j. gundlach @xcite etc .",
    "presently , no deviation from this equality has ever been found , at least to the accuracy @xmath0 . but all of these verifications are solely constrained to be in the range of weak gravitational strength , and have not been validated in the strong gravity nor in the electromagnetic field .",
    "so this puzzle of the equality of masses remains unclear and has not satisfied results .",
    "the paper brings forward a theoretical model to study the variation of gravitational mass in the electromagnetic field .",
    "it carries out the result that the gravitational mass will be varied in the strong strength by capture or release the energy density of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the electromagnetic field can be described with the quaternion @xcite . in the treatise on electromagnetic field theory ,",
    "the quaternion was first used by j. @xcite to demonstrate the electromagnetic field in 1873 . and the gravitational field can be described by the quaternion also , and can be used to work out the variation of the gravitational mass in the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field and electromagnetic field both can be illustrated by the quaternion , but they are quite different from each other indeed . it is assumed for simplicity that there exists one kind of symmetry between the electromagnetic field with the gravitational field . we add another four - dimensional basis vector to the ordinary four - dimensional basis vector to include the feature of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "some physical quantities are the functions of coordinates @xmath1 , and @xmath2 in these two kinds of fields , but the basis vector , @xmath3 , of the gravitational field differs from the basis vector , @xmath4 , of the electromagnetic field .",
    "two kinds of basis vectors constitute the basis vector @xmath5 of the octonion @xcite , with @xmath6 .",
    "the symbol @xmath7 denotes the octonion multiplication . and",
    "the octonion basis vectors satisfy the multiplication characteristics in table [ tab : table1 ] .    in the quaternion space ,",

    "@xmath52 where , the applied force @xmath49 includes the gravity , inertial force , interacting force between the angular momentum with gravity , lorentz force , and interacting force between the magnetic moment with electromagnetic field , etc .",
    "the above means the field equations of the gravity are modified , but maxwell s equations of the electromagnetic field remind unchanged .",
    "meanwhile the definitions of the applied force and linear momentum etc . are expanded in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields .    in the theoretical model which consists of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields ,",
    "the low - mass charged particle is on equilibrium state , when the total applied force is equal to zero .",

    "it is useful to decompose eq.(11 ) along the @xmath53 , @xmath70 where , @xmath71 is the mass of the earth , and @xmath72 is the universal gravitational constant .    in the paper ,",
    "if we consider the @xmath73 and @xmath74 as the force of inertia and gravity respectively in eq.(12 ) , then the @xmath39 and @xmath75 will be defined as the inertial mass and gravitational mass correspondingly .",

    ", the low - mass charged particle is on free - fall as well . and eq.(14 )",
    "can be deduced from eq.(11 ) directly .",
    "it asserts the @xmath54 of the uncharged particle ( the neutron etc . )",
    "will change with the strength of the electromagnetic field also .    from the above",
    ", we find the @xmath54 has a limited effect on the motion of the large - mass particle , because the @xmath54 is quite small .",
    "therefore the equality of masses is believed to be correct in most cases . however , when there exists a very strong strength of electromagnetic field , the @xmath54 can become very huge , and then has an impact on the motion of the low - mass charged particle obviously .",
    "in the theoretical model , the gravitational mass changes with the electromagnetic strength also , and has a small deviation from the inertial mass .",
    "this states that it will violate the equality of masses in the fairly strong strength of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the definition of the gravitational mass equates the gravitational mass @xmath75 with the sum of the inertial mass @xmath39 and the variation of gravitational mass @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath54 is related to the energy density of gravitational field and electromagnetic field .",
    "this inference means that the strong strength of the electromagnetic field will cause the distinct variation of gravitational mass also . but",
    "this problem has never been discussed before . in other words ,",
    "the equality of masses has not been validated in the strong electromagnetic field .",
    "in contrast to the gravitational field , the super - strong strength of electromagnetic field may be easier to achieve . if we could obtain the super - strong electromagnetic field in the lab , more experiments about the equality of masses would be performed .",
    "one international research group found that the variation of the proton - electron mass ratio based on lab measurement @xcite .",
    "it is expected to find the similar experimental results under different strength of the electromagnetic field or gravitational field .",
    "it should be noted that the study for the gravitational mass has examined only one kind of the simple case , of which the low - mass charged particle is on the free - fall motion in the constraint electromagnetic field or the gravitational field . despite its preliminary character",
    ", this study can clearly indicate that the gravitational mass is always changed with the electromagnetic strength .",
    "for the future studies , the theoretical model will concentrate on only the suitable predictions about the large variation of gravitational mass in the fairly strong strength of the electromagnetic field .",
