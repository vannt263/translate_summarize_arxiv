    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been separated into two classes : long - soft bursts , and short bursts ( nakar 2006,gehrels et  al .",
    "the origin of long - soft bursts has been connected to the death of low - metallicity massive stars ( piran 2005 , gehrels et  al .",
    "however , while observations support a binary merger origin for short bursts ( nakar 2006,gehrels et  al .",
    "2007 ) , the exact nature of the progenitor remains uncertain : they could be either double neutron stars ( ns  ns ) or black hole  neutron star ( bh  ns ) binaries .",
    "the number of bh  ns binaries that both merge and produce grbs is hard to estimate since ( i ) no such system has yet been observed ; ( ii ) formation models are rather uncertain and predict very small bh ",
    "ns merger rates ( likely too small to explain most of the short bursts ) ; and ( iii ) theory suggests that the fraction of bh  ns mergers producing bursts depends sensitively on the black hole spin and spin  orbit orientation ( belczynski et  al .",
    "2007b ) , but black hole birth spins are not well constrained observationally or theoretically . on the other hand , ns ",
    "ns binaries are only observed in the milky way , but their properties and numbers are also in agreement with theoretical models , and their merger rate is sufficient to explain the present - day short burst population ( nakar 2006 , belczynski et al .",
    "2007a ) .",
    "we have performed an extensive theoretical study of high - mass binary stars ( potential progenitors of ns ",
    "ns systems ) using ` startrack ` , a population synthesis code incorporating the most up - to - date and detailed input physics for massive stars ( belczynski et al 2008 ) .",
    "the code employs state - of - the - art predictions for neutron star and black hole masses based on hydrodynamic core collapse simulations ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) and detailed stellar structure and evolution calculations for massive stars ( timmes , woosley , & weaver 1996 ) .",
    "our models predict a galactic ns ",
    "ns merger rate in the range @xmath2 ( belczynski et al .",
    "2007a ) , in good agreement with the empirical estimate of @xmath3 ( kim , kalogera , & lorimer , 2006 ) .",
    "the spread in our predicted rates originates from including the most significant model uncertainties associated with the treatment of dynamical mass transfer episodes ( common envelope phases ) , which are involved in the formation of most double compact objects ( belczynski et al .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] we compare short grb rates with ns ",
    "ns merger rates in the present - day ( redshift @xmath4 ) universe . extrapolating the ns ",
    "ns merger rates to the local universe by assuming a star - forming density of @xmath5 milky way - equivalents per @xmath6 , oshaughnessy et al . 2007 . ]",
    "we estimate the local universe ns ",
    "ns merger rate to be in the range @xmath7 . by comparison ,",
    "the estimated conservative lower limit on the short grb rate is @xmath8 , based on the batse / swift sample ( nakar 2006 ) .",
    "this estimate relies on very conservative assumptions : ( i ) there is no collimation and ( ii ) there are no bursts dimmer than we have already observed , thus providing a true lower limit on the rate .",
    "therefore , even adopting the most optimistic predictions for the ns ",
    "ns merger rate and the most pessimistic bound on the local short grb event rate , the fraction of ns  ns mergers @xmath9 that produce grbs must be greater than at least @xmath5 to explain the majority of known short bursts .    in this paper",
    "we start with the assumption that all short grbs are connected with ns - ns system mergers that produce a black hole .",
    "we discuss the implications of relaxing this stringent assumption at the end of the paper .    from our models",
    "we also derive physical properties of double neutron stars , with individual masses of neutron stars being of particular interest .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the relation between progenitor ( single star ) mass and final remnant mass used in our evolutionary calculations .",
    "mass transfer and other binary interactions change this simple picture , through both accretion and mass loss , which can either increase or decrease an individual binary component mass . however , ( belczynski et al .",
    "2007b ) argues that we do not expect significant mass accretion onto the components of ns ",
    "ns binaries . the population model we adopt for our discussion here produces ns mass distributions that appear consistent with",
    "the current observed ns - ns sample , at least in the extent of the mass ranges ( fig .",
    "3 ) . while mass transfer does influence the remnant masses ( e.g. , smearing the narrowly peaked mass distribution implied by fig .",
    "2 ) , the qualitative structure is largely preserved , as one would expect from isolated stellar evolution combined with an initial mass function that falls steeply with increasing initial mass .",
    "the predicted neutron star mass distribution only very weakly depends on evolutionary model assumptions because the neutron star formation mass is almost independent of the progenitor mass ( timmes et al .",
    "1996 ) and mass accretion in ns - ns progenitor binaries is rather small ( belczynski et al .",
    "2007a ) .    depending on the masses in the progenitor binary and the highly uncertain nuclear equation of state , the final remnant of a ns ",
    "ns merger may or may not collapse to a black hole .",
    "we estimate the final gravitational mass of the compact remnant as @xmath10 where the initial neutron star masses are denoted by @xmath11 and we have assumed that the torus mass is sufficiently large to power a grb ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) ( setiawan , ruffert , & janka 2004 , lee & ramirez - ruiz 2007 ) and that 10% of rest mass is lost in neutrinos ( lattimer & yahli 1989 ; timmes et al .",
    "higher rest mass loss ( e.g. , metzger , thompson & quataert 2007 ) would only strengthen our subsequent conclusions . because stars more massive than @xmath13 ( progenitors of massive neutron stars with @xmath14 ) are much rarer than those forming lighter neutron stars ( @xmath15 ) we _ a priori _",
    "expect that most remnants from ns ",
    "ns mergers will have rather low mass @xmath16 ( see eq .  1 for two @xmath17 neutron stars ) .",
    "neither observations nor nuclear theory have yet pinned down the maximum neutron star mass @xmath18 above which a black hole must form .",
    "thus , the fraction of binary neutron stars which produce black holes and are able to power short grbs is set by the fraction of mergers such that @xmath19 we therefore calculate the fraction of our simulated ns ",
    "ns mergers that lead to black hole formation and a short grb as a function of @xmath18 ; see fig .  4 .",
    "observations of the highest mass neutron stars ( @xmath20 ; ( barziv et  al .",
    "2001 , ransom et  al . 2005 ) and lowest mass black holes ( @xmath21 ; ( orosz 2003 , casares 2006 ) only weakly constrain this parameter .",
    "remnant masses from ns ",
    "ns mergers ( @xmath22 ) obtained both from our simulations and from observations all fall very close to the range @xmath23 .    comparing figs 1 and 4",
    "we immediately deduce that , since the fraction @xmath24 of ns ",
    "ns mergers that produce short grbs must be greater than @xmath5 ( fig .  1 )",
    ", the neutron star maximum mass @xmath18 must be less than @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "because we lack a robust lower bound on the mass of the residual torus surrounding the black hole , we have adopted a conservative upper limit on @xmath18 obtained by assuming a negligible torus mass ( i.e. , replace @xmath26 with @xmath4 in eq .  1 ) .",
    "this result has been obtained with the assumption that all ( @xmath27 ) short grbs are connected with ns - ns mergers .",
    "it is however possible that only a fraction of short grbs is produced in ns - ns mergers .",
    "how does our result depend on the fraction @xmath28 of short grbs that are connected with ns - ns mergers ?",
    "the lower limit on @xmath24 is then decreased by @xmath28 , see figure  [ fig1 ] . if @xmath29 , then the limit lower limit becomes @xmath30 , and as is clearly seen from figure  [ fig3 ] , the upper limit on the maximum mass of a neutron star remains unchanged . for the values of @xmath31",
    "the ns - ns mergers are not important for overall short grb population , as the mergers would consist of only @xmath32 of the short grbs .",
    "therefore , in this case short grbs do not provide information about the merger product .",
    "our proposed limit on the maximum neutron star mass is still above the maximum masses allowed by almost all proposed models for the nuclear equation of state ( lattimer & prakash 2007 ) .",
    "however , the proposed limit would remain unchanged even if a dramatic improvement in short grb surveys led to a significantly larger lower bound on the local short grb rate : because of the sharp decrease in @xmath24 with @xmath18 shown in fig .",
    "if , however , electromagnetic observations could constrain the least luminous short grbs and thus provide an _ upper _ bound on the short grb rate , with gravitational wave observations at the same time accurately determining the ns ",
    "ns merger rate , then @xmath24 could also be constrained from _",
    "above_. if only a fraction of ns ",
    "ns mergers produce short bursts , because @xmath24 depends so sensitively on @xmath18 , the combination of upper and lower limits would constrain the maximum neutron star mass extremely tightly , even if the assumptions going into eq .  1 are relaxed .    while our limit on the effective maximum neutron star mass is entirely empirical , detailed merger models including realistic relativistic dynamics , neutrino transport , magnetic fields , and",
    "potentially even energy extraction from the final black hole remain under intense investigation ( janka & ruffert 1996 ; oechslin & janka 2006 ) .",
    "many merger remnants are expected to be ( temporarily ) rotationally supported against collapse ( morrison , baumgarte & shapiro 2004 ) , with a `` hypermassive '' remnant neutron star eventually spinning down and collapsing to a black hole ( faber et al . 2006 ; duez et al .",
    "2007 ; shibata & taniguchi 2006 ) .",
    "our model only relies upon the current consensus on double neutron star mergers , as summarized by oechslin & janka ( 2006 ) : sufficiently massive binary mergers produce a black hole and only mergers that produce a black hole extract enough energy to power short grbs .",
    "known galactic black holes extend in mass up to @xmath33 ( casares 2006 ) , while two recently discovered black hole candidates in other galaxies ( orosz et al .",
    "2007 , prestwich et al .",
    "2007 ) have even higher masses of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "clearly black holes can form with rather high masses in different types of environments .",
    "the lower mass limit is not well constrained observationally , as the highest - mass neutron stars barely reach @xmath36 , while the lowest - mass black holes are above @xmath37 . in order to explain the observed short grbs with ns ",
    "ns mergers , under the assumption of black hole  torus central engine model",
    ", we have shown that the maximum neutron star mass must be lower than @xmath1 . however , pulsar surveys ( ransom et al .",
    "2005 ) have discovered increasingly more massive neutron stars .",
    "so far in our analysis we have included only ns ",
    "ns systems formed in the field .",
    "there is one known relativistic double neutron star system in the galactic globular cluster m15 , that has probably formed through dynamical interactions .",
    "this binary consists of two low - mass neutron stars ( @xmath38 and @xmath17 ; jacoby et al .",
    "2006 ) very similar to those in the galactic field , so the results of our analysis are not changed by this isolated observation .",
    "moreover , it was estimated that no more than @xmath39 short grbs can originate from mergers of double neutron stars formed in globular clusters ( grindlay , portegies zwart , & mcmillan 2006 ) .",
    "if any observation can be made that establishes unambiguously a pulsar mass ( either in the field or a globular cluster ) over @xmath1 , this would exclude a black hole ",
    "torus short grb central engine model for double neutron star mergers .",
    "we note that a tentative mass measurement for a pulsar of @xmath40 was recently reported by ( freire et al .",
    "if this measurement is confirmed , the double neutron star mergers may still be possible progenitors for short grbs .",
    "however , the central engine model will need to be reexamined .",
    "in particular , it was proposed that a merger of two neutron stars may lead to the formation of a magnetar ; a rapidly rotating highly magnetized and high mass neutron star ( with or without a torus ) that can lead to a short grb ( e.g. , usov 1992 ; kluzniak & ruderman 1998 ; dai et al .",
    "2006 ; metzger et al .",
    "gravitational wave observatories ( ligo , virgo ) may provide the direct evidence that ns - ns merger can produce a short grb if there is a coincidence of the burst and the inspiral gravitational wave signal .",
    "it may also be possible to distinguish a merger product ( ns versus bh ) from the shape of the merger and ringdown signal or from radio pulses if a magnetar was formed in a nearby gamma - ray burst event .",
