    "the dirac equation ( * de * ) in a minkowski spacetime can be obtained using dirac s original procedure through a linearization of @xmath9 ( where  @xmath6 is the first casimir invariant of the enveloping algebra of the poincar group ) and its application to covariant spinor fields ( sections of @xmath10 , see appendices b and c ) .  in the appendix",
    "d using the clifford and spin - clifford bundles formalism and an almost trivial heuristic argument we present a derivation of an equivalent equation  to * de * which is called the dirac - hestenes equation ( * dhe * ) .",
    "our derivation makes clear the fact that the * de * ( or the equivalent * dhe * ) express nothing more than the fact that a free spin @xmath0 particle moves with a constant velocity in minkowski spacetime following an integral line of a well defined velocity field .",
    "this observation is a crucial one for the main objective of this paper , the one of writing wave equations for a free spin @xmath0 moving in a de sitter manifold equipped with a metric field inherited from a bulk spacetime @xmath11 ( see section 2 ) .",
    "it is intuitive ( given the topology of the de sitter manifold ) that such a motion must happen with a constant angular momentum and as we will see a heuristic deduction of a dirac - hestenes like equation in this case results identical from the one which we get if we linearize @xmath9 ( where @xmath6 is the first casimir invariant of the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra of the de sitter group ) taking into account a a constraint coming from the linearization of  @xmath7 , the second casimir invariant of the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra of the de sitter group    to be more precise , in sections 3  and 4 we will present two dirac - hestenes  like equations for a spin @xmath0 fermion field ] @xmath12 living in de sitter manifold equipped with a metric field @xmath13 ( see section 2 ) , which will be abbreviate as * dhess1 * and * dhess2*. the * dhess1 * will be obtained by linearizing the first casimir operator @xmath6 using a constraint imposed on the * dhsf * arising from the linearization of @xmath7 . on the other hand * dhess2",
    "* will be obtained by a physically and heuristically derivation resulting by simply imposing that the motion of a free particle in the de sitter manifold is described by a constant angular momentum @xmath14-form as seem by an hypothetical observer living in the bulk spacetime @xmath11 . of course , as we are going to see the heuristic derivation is only possible using the clifford bundle formalism .",
    "it is a remarkable result that * dhess1 * and * dhess2 * coincide and moreover translation of those equations in the covariant spinor field formalism gives a first order partial differential equation ( which is equivalent to the one first postulated by dirac @xcite ) .",
    "it will be shown that * * dhess1 ( * * and thus  * dhess2 * ) reduces to the dirac - hestenes equation ( * dhe ) * in minkowski spacetime when @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the radius of the de sitter manifold .",
    "in section 5  we study the limit of * dhess1 * and * dhess2 * when @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the radius of the de sitter manifold)showing that it gives the dirac - hestenes equation in minkowski spacetime .",
    "in section 6 we present our conclusions , comparing our results with others already appearing in the literature .we claim that our approach reveals details of subject that are completely hidden in the usual matrix approach to the subject where dirac fields are seen as mappings @xmath17 , in particular the nature of the object @xmath18 ( eq.([c19aa ] ) appearing in the linearization of @xmath6 and related ( but not equal ) the mass of the particle .",

    "finally , appendix d presents a heuristic derivation of dirac equation in minkowski spacetime that served as inspiration for the theory presented in the main text .",

    "we have @xmath47 with @xmath48 and we immediately find that @xmath49 and the matrix with entries @xmath50 is the diagonal matrix @xmath51 .",
    "since the north pole of the pseudo sphere is not covered by the coordinate functions we see that ( omitting two dimensions ) the region of the spacetime as seem by an observer living the south pole is the region inside the so called absolute of _ cayley - klein _ of equation @xmath52    ds2.eps    in figure 1 we can see that all timelike curves ( 2 ) and lightlike ( 1 ) starts in the past horizon  and end on the future horizon .",
