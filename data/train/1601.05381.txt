    "[ [ master - equation . ] ] master equation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    here we introduce the master equation governing the decoherence due to the scattering of the optical trapping photons .",
    "it is a well known fact , that in the far off resonant regime where operate optical lattices , the induced excited state population can be typically neglected ( in fact is proportional to @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the rabi frequency of the trapping laser and @xmath84 its detuning from the excited state , which is easy to show e.g. from the bloch equations ) .",
    "this is a desired feature , since one typically wants to avoid the heating due to the photon absorption / emission by the trapped atoms . as a consequence",
    ", one can consider only the decay of coherences ( which are of order @xmath105 ) while neglecting the change in the state population .",
    "next we consider a situation , where the individual sites of the optical lattice can be spatially fully resolved by measuring the scattered photons .",
    "this is indeed the feature which led to the success of and is exploited in the quantum gas microscopes @xcite . under these assumptions",
    ", the decoherence of the system reduces to the product of individual decoherence events , where a measurement of a scattered photon results in a projection of the atom to a given spin state of the ground state manifold .",
    "the corresponding master equation reads = 2 _ i=1^n ( _ g",
    "( _ i _ i- \\{_i , } ) + _ s ( _ i _ i-",
    "\\{_i , } ) ) , where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , are the scattering rates ( [ eq : decay conv ] ) for the atoms in @xmath25 , @xmath27 state and @xmath108 is the anticommutator . straigtforward algebra allows to rewrite this expression in terms of the operators @xmath109 yielding [ me conv ] = _ i=1^n ( _ z^i _ z^i- )     +    [ [ state - evolution . ] ] state evolution .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it is straightforward to solve the master equation .",
    "the dephasing process acts locally resulting in the decay of the off - diagonal terms .",
    "formally this process can be described by the completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is given simply by the product of the @xmath33 individual dephasing processes [ cp conv ] _ t^i ( ) = ( ) + ( ) _ z^i _ z^i . for the initial product state ( [ eq : prod state ] ) , @xmath112 , the overlap with a state at a later time is given by o_= tr ( ( t))= _ i=1^n ^i_t ( ) = ( ) ^n      [ [ master - equation.-1 ] ] master equation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as described in the main text , the spatial decoherence can be described phenomenologically by the master equation @xcite = - d*x * d*x * ( * x * , * x * ) [ eq : rho dot app ] where @xmath37 is the position basis for the @xmath33 particles .",
    "we start by explicitly computing the localization rate ( [ eq : gamma ] ) ( * x * , * x * ) = _ i , j=1^n _ i _ j ( ( x_i - x_j)+(x_i - x_j)- 2(x_i - x_j ) )",
    ". the localization function @xmath39 can be expanded for small separations @xmath26 compared to the localization length @xmath113 , which is well justified when considering the model of @xcite , where @xmath114 m and we consider separations of @xmath115 10 cm . with this assumption @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and we have used the fact , that @xmath39 has to be symmetric , @xmath118 , which imposes the cancellation of the linear term in the expansion .",
    "next , note that in the situation where the atoms are tightly trapped in the lattice , the spin state of each atom @xmath119 is fully entangled with its position @xmath120 , such that the decoherence rate only depends on the global atomic state through @xmath121 , where @xmath122 . denoting the spin",
    "states @xmath123 and @xmath124 , for lattice spacing @xmath125 and separation @xmath24 the position of each atom is given by @xmath126 . in the regime of interest of large separation @xmath127 ,",
    "the separation of two atoms within the same lattice can be neglected and @xmath128 . in this approximation and putting @xmath129 for all @xmath130 as we consider identical particles @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the total z - spin of the state @xmath133 , @xmath134 , with @xmath135 .",
    "this allows to rewrite the master equation ( [ eq : rho dot app ] ) governing the localization in terms of total spin [ me unconv ] = ( s_z s_z - \\{s_z^2 , } ) .",
    "the prefactor in ( [ me unconv ] ) can be linked to the parameters of @xcite by combining the results of @xcite with the present analysis .",
    "this was done e.g. in @xcite with the result @xmath136 .     +    [ [ state - evolution.-1 ] ] state evolution .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in order to solve the master equation we realize that the collective spin noise process corresponds to the diffusion of the polar angle of the total spin . after an elementary time step , the density matrix can be written as an average over a random variable @xmath137 ( t+dt)= ( t ) + dt ( s_z ( t ) s_z - s_z^2 ( t ) - ( t ) s_z^2 ) = _ [ eq : rho time step ] where @xmath138 denotes an ensemble average over @xmath137 with the moments @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this can be easily verified by substituting the expansion of the operator @xmath142 into ( [ eq : rho time step ] ) .",
    "after @xmath143 time steps the state of the system is ( t ) = ^col_t((0))=__1, ... ,_n = e^i s_z ( 0 ) e^-i s_z , where we have introduced the cptp map @xmath144 corresponding to the collective noise .    in the last equality we have used the fact that for @xmath145 the sum of independent random variables @xmath146 is a normally distributed random variable with the variance @xmath147 .",
    "the overlap of the state at time @xmath148 with the initial state ( [ eq : prod state ] ) can now be easily computed as follows .",
    "first we write the expression for the overlap o _ = tr ( ( t ) ) = |e^i _ z|^2n = ^2n ( ) . [ eq : o qg expr ] the evaluation of the integral can be performed numerically .",
    "one can proceed further in the large @xmath33 limit - to get the assymptotic expansion for @xmath149 we remark that ^2n()_k=-^(+ 2 k ) n , [ eq : expr ] where @xmath150 is the kronecker delta and we have used _",
    "^2 n ( ) d=. substituting ( [ eq : expr ] ) back to ( [ eq : o qg expr ] ) yields an infinite sum , which can be evaluated as @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the jacobi @xmath153 function .",
    "this leads to the result @xmath154      it is interesting to compare the decay of the overlap of the product state ( which we considered for the simplicity of its experimental preparation ) with the decay for some highly entangled state .",
    "a benchmark example in metrology is the ghz state @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "one gets for the local and collective dephasing respectively @xmath157 which yields the overlaps @xmath158",
    "in this section we provide a simple description of the atomic motion in a time dependent optical lattice . considering the tight binding situation , where the atoms are firmly trapped at an intensity extrema of the lattice ,",
    "it is in principle possible to displace the atoms by an arbitrary distance @xmath26 . working in the regime @xmath159 ,",
    "the @xmath160 species can be displaced independently of the @xmath161 species and thus , in principle , allows for creation of a superposition of type ( for a single atom ) = c_g ( x - x_g ) + c_s ( x - x_s ) , where we assume , that due to the tight binding the position of the atom is treated classically and can be described by a classical field @xmath162 , which has the property @xmath163 , where @xmath107 . in other words , with respect to the position in real space we treat the atom as a classical point like object , which is a justified description for the system where separations of multiples of lattice spacings between @xmath25 and @xmath27 are achieved .    as only the @xmath160 species is displaced , we thus seek solutions of the classical equation of motion associated with the hamiltonian h = + v_s(x , t ) , [ eq h ] where @xmath82 is given by ( [ eq : v_s ] ) .",
    "the hamilton equations of motion given by ( [ eq h ] ) , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , can be combined to give _",
    "s = - ( 2k x_s + 2 k x_latt(t ) ) , [ eq : eom ] where @xmath166 is the lattice motion .",
    "as explained in the main text , the specific choice of the lattice motion is a result of an optimization with respect to a given figure of merit and subject to the constraints such as a maximal achievable separation or the timescale of the experiment . for the sake of concreteness and",
    "motivated by the experimental results of @xcite , we consider lattice motion with an initial sinusoidal acceleration ramp such that the maximal separation @xmath78 is reached after a time @xmath167 .",
    "when @xmath78 is reached , the atoms remain separated for a waiting time @xmath168 before they are brought back together with the same acceleration ramp of duration @xmath167 , x_latt(t)=        in order to control the atomic motion , one requires the atoms remain trapped in a given lattice site at all times , i.e. that the trapping force is larger than the dynamical force @xmath169 acting on the atoms .",
    "it is easy to check , that the relation ( [ eq : acc ] ) provides indeed the desired condition . by numerically solving ( [ eq : eom ] ) we have verified , that when the acceleration of the lattice @xmath170 , the atoms follow the lattice potential , while they are not able to follow for @xmath171 . in the following ,",
    "we thus restrict only to the situation , where @xmath170 and the atomic motion @xmath24 can be identified with the lattice motion ( [ eq : motion 1 ] ) .",
    "next , we would like to optimize the lattice motion of the form ( [ eq : motion 1 ] ) , i.e. optimizing @xmath167 and @xmath168 with respect to the ratio @xmath172 between the unconventional and conventional decoherence rates , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) . since @xmath173 , where @xmath65 is the total duration of the atomic round trip",
    ", one can define an effective distance @xmath68 for any atomic motion @xmath24 and @xmath65 through d_eff^2",
    "_ 0^t d(t)^2 .",
    "[ eq : d eff ] taking @xmath174 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion 1 ] ) , one readily finds d_eff^2 = d_max^2 , where @xmath175 and = _ 0^t dt d(t)^2 = ( 8 + ) 0.4 . since @xmath69 and @xmath176 , r .",
    "[ eq : ratio prop ] the maximal possible acceleration for a given rabi frequency is given by ( [ eq : acc ] ) and at the same time is related to the motion ( [ eq : motion 1 ] ) by @xmath177 substituting ( [ eq : acc ] ) to ( [ eq : ratio prop ] ) yields r d_max k ( 1 + 2(-1 ) ) t^2 , where we have kept all the factors depending on the separation , detuning or time .",
    "the ratio @xmath86 is thus maximized for maximum possible detuning @xmath84 , separation @xmath78 and , subject to the constraint @xmath178 , for @xmath179 . using @xmath179 ( i.e. @xmath180 ) in ( [ eq : motion 1 ] ) then yields the optimized atomic motion ( [ eq : distance fction ] ) ."

    "<S> , we emphasize that our results allow one to bound the model of ellis and co - workers @xcite in any scenario where atoms are spatially delocalized over sufficiently large distances . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to quantify the bounds provided e.g. by atom interferometers with large momentum transfers , yielding large spatial separations @xcite . </S>",
