    "in the nuclear mean - field approach , the energy of the nucleus is computed as the expectation value of a two - body hamiltonian on a trial wave - function @xcite .",
    "besides the relativistic approaches@xcite , there exists two main families of two - body effective forces to this date , the zero - range skyrme @xcite interaction and the finite - range gogny one @xcite .",
    "both are empirical effective forces and there exists a number of realistic parametrizations .",
    "skyrme forces lead to a local energy density which is the basic building block of the nuclear energy density functional ( edf ) theory @xcite . the gogny interaction , because of its finite range , is non - local and computationally more involved , for this reason the calculations are most conveniently carried out in configuration space , i.e. the solutions to the hartree - fock ( hf ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) problem are expanded on a given basis .",
    "the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis has always played a special role in configuration space calculations , as its eigenfunctions are given analytically and are separable .",
    "however , a well - known deficiency of this basis is that it is made exclusively of bound - states since the underlying potential has infinite walls . in practice ,",
    "since calculations are always performed in a given truncation scheme ( for a fixed cut - off of the basis ) the localization of all ho basis states imply that the physical wave - functions of the system will always acquire a gaussian asymptotic , including the weakly - bound and positive - energy states .",
    "this is clearly unrealistic , as spherical continuum states should be spherical waves .",
    "the consequences of this deficiency become more serious close to the drip line , as pairing correlations can couple discrete bound - states to the continuum .",
    "it is thus critical to properly describe the continuous spectrum even at the level of ground - state calculations @xcite .",
    "there exists a number of techniques to take into account the continuum in nuclear structure calculations , and it is not the purpose of this article to discuss in detail the merits of every one of them .",
    "let us just mention briefly for completeness : coordinate - space skyrme hfb theory with either vanishing @xcite or outgoing - wave boundary conditions @xcite , coordinate - space relativistic hartree - bogoliubov with finite - element method @xcite , the use of the gamow basis in the skyrme hfb theory @xcite , in the continuum shell model @xcite and in the gamow shell model @xcite .",
    "at the present time technical difficulties in including the full continuum with the exact resonant and non - resonant spectrum lead to the consequence that the most advanced theories are only applied with simple model interactions that are tailored to capture the main physical properties of the system . only in the coordinate - space hfb approach realistic skyrme interactions",
    "were employed with density - dependence zero - range forces in the pairing channel ( requiring the introduction of a cut - off in the quasi - particle spectrum or a regularization procedure @xcite ) . moreover , as far as mean - field based theories are concerned , no attempt has been done to include with the coupling to the continuum the restoration of broken symmetries or collective motion .",
    "therefore , in order to combine the flexibility of configuration space calculations with the necessary inclusion of the continuum , it has been proposed in @xcite to work in a basis made of the eigenstates of the woods - saxon potential . the latter",
    "are obtained by integrating the schrdinger equation in a box of size @xmath0 with a mesh size @xmath1 . in practice @xmath2 fm and @xmath3 fm",
    "are sufficient to obtain a good convergence of the solutions .",
    "boundary conditions are set on the walls of the box . as usual ,",
    "several choices are possible .",
    "outgoing wave boundary conditions lead to wave - functions that are not square - integrable , and special techniques must be employed to overcome this difficulty @xcite .",
    "vanishing boundary conditions guarantee that the basis functions are square - integrable and can thus be normalized at the price of eliminating all the continuum states that do not have a node on the walls of the box .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that both techniques essentially lead to very similar results as far as bound - states and bulk properties of nuclei are concerned . in the following , we use vanishing box boundary conditions .    in our calculations",
    "we use the finite - range gogny interaction @xcite .",
    "the same interaction is used in the particle - hole channel ( mean - field ) and particle - particle channel ( pairing ) and both the direct and exchange contributions coming from _ all _ the terms of the interaction are taken into account in the calculation . the finite - range of the force in the pairing channel allows to avoid the divergence problem ( in momentum space ) and cut - off dependence of zero - range forces .",
    "all of our calculations are performed in spherical symmetry .    to obtain quantitative information on the neutron halo in neutron - rich nuclei",
    "we make use of the helm method @xcite .",
    "firstly , the neutrons ( protons ) form factor is computed as the fourier transform of the neutrons ( protons ) density . in spherical symmetry",
    ", this leads to : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the momentum , @xmath6 is the spherical bessel function of order 0 and @xmath7 is the density ( @xmath8 standing for neutron or proton ) .",
    "this form factor built out of the realistic one - body density , in our case calculated with the gogny force , is then compared to the helm form - factor obtained from the convolution of the gaussian profile @xmath9 with a sharp density profile : @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 elsewhere . since this model",
    "is presented in details in the references quoted , we simply recall the formulas we are going to use .",
    "the two parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the model are determined in the following way .",
    "the rms radius @xmath15 is defined as the squared root of the mean - value of the operator @xmath16 .",
    "it is extracted from the nucleonic density : @xmath17 for the helm radius one straightforwardly obtains @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the diffraction radius : @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the first zero of the realistic form - factor ( [ formfactor ] ) obtained in our theoretical approach . the surface thickness @xmath14 is defined as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of particles , @xmath24 the spherical bessel function of order 1 and @xmath25 is the first maximum of the realistic form - factor ( [ formfactor ] ) .    at this point",
    "we should note that the method does not carry out any information on the eventual decorrelation between a core and a few valence particles .",
    "it only provides a simple and fast method to assess the spatial extension of the nucleus and an excellent starting point to determine the best halo candidates .",
    "however , in few - body nuclear models , the nuclear halo is often interpreted as one single nucleon or a pair of nucleons orbiting around a core , see e.g. @xcite for two - body models and @xcite for 3-body models . in order to reconcile these cluster approaches with a mean - field description of the nucleus",
    ", a more detailed analysis of the density should be carried out .",
    "alternative techniques have been proposed to cure this deficiency @xcite .",
    "it is usually convenient to multiply the rms and the helm radius by @xmath26 .",
    "the quantities @xmath27 are related to the underlying shape of the nucleus .",
    "a measure of the nuclear halo is then provided by the quantity : @xmath28 the neutron skin can be defined in various ways depending on which type of radius is considered .",
    "its general expression is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 can be either the geometrical radius , the helm radius or the diffraction radius .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the best approximation to the neutron skin is obtained when taking the helm radius , as the latter is somewhat rid of spurious contributions coming from the neutron halo .",
    "systematic calculations near the neutron drip line have been carried out using the spherical hfb code in the woods - saxon basis that was presented in @xcite .",
    "the basis was constructed from the eigenstates of the ws potential with the universal parametrization of @xcite applied to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 nucleus .",
    "the schrdinger equation was integrated in a box of @xmath2 fm with vanishing boundary conditions .",
    "all eigenstates with @xmath33 and @xmath34 were retained in the basis . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "such a choice guarantees a good convergence of the subsequent hfb calculation .",
    "there exist few parametrizations of the gogny interaction : in our calculations we considered the parametrizations d1 of @xcite and d1s of @xcite . for each of them",
    "the neutron drip line was calculated based on the requirement that the one - neutron @xmath35 separation energy must be negative for bound nuclei . since @xmath36 ,",
    "the criterion @xmath37 is stricter than the condition that the two - neutron separation energy is negative . in the hfb theory",
    "the one - neutron separation energy @xmath38 is approximated by the neutrons fermi energy @xmath39 . a nearly equivalent condition to define",
    "the one neutron drip line is therefore @xmath40 .",
    "when hfb pairing correlations vanish ( case of closed shells ) , the value of the chemical potential @xmath41 is meaningless and can not be used to define the drip line any more ( hartree - fock limit ) . however , in the hf approach and within the approximation of the validity of koopmans theorem @xcite , the stability of a nucleus is simply governed by the position of the last occupied level : if it has positive energy , then the nucleus is unbound with respect to particle emission .",
    "we display in table [ table01 ] the one neutron drip line nuclei obtained with both interactions . in the presence of pairing correlations",
    "the criterion @xmath40 has been used . for the neutron shell closures @xmath42 ( d1s : elements @xmath43 to @xmath44 , d1 : elements @xmath43 and @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 ( d1s : elements @xmath47 to @xmath48 , d1 : elements @xmath49 to @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( d1s : elements @xmath52 to @xmath53 , d1 : elements @xmath54 to @xmath55 ) the neutron pairing correlations vanishes and we have to rely on koopmans theorem .",
    "the columns corresponding to the d1s interaction were already presented in @xcite and are recalled for comparison .",
    "we would like to comment at this point that , due to some technical problems with our previous codes at the aforementioned shell closures , in @xcite the drip line was predicted with two neutron less for the elements kr , te , xe , ba , hg and pb . we also show in table [ table01 ] the difference in the number of neutrons between the drip line nuclei with the d1 and d1s interaction : @xmath56 . in general",
    "the d1 parametrization predicts a drip line with more neutrons , probably due to the fact that it provides more pairing correlations than the d1s one .",
    "let us emphasize that all calculations performed in this work are restricted to spherical symmetry .",
    "several of the nuclei listed in table [ table01 ] may be deformed in their ground - state @xcite .",
    "symmetry - unrestricted hfb calculations of neutron - rich nuclei would most likely shift the position of the drip line in several places .",
    ".table of spherical hfb one neutron drip line nuclei obtained with the d1s and d1 interactions .",
    "the columns marked @xmath57 represent the shift of the drip line ( in number of neutrons ) when using the d1 interaction compared to the d1s . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      figures [ fig07 ] and [ fig08 ] suggest that the impact of particle - number projection may be instrumental in the formation of sizeable halos , since the rvap mechanism always guarantees a solution with non - zero pairing correlations . since the chemical potential is irrelevant in a projected theory we should therefore , in principle , compute this quantity using _ projected _ energies and compare it from the results obtained using un - projected quantities . as emphasized earlier ,",
    "the application of particle number projection in odd nuclei is not possible at the moment , hence the one neutron rvap drip line is not accessible .",
    "we therefore carried out systematic rvap calculations of the two neutron separation energies , @xmath58 , near the drip line using the d1s interaction .",
    "the particular choice of the interaction is secondary in this study , since the focus is on the particular role of particle number projection .",
    "the procedure was as follows : for a given drip line element @xmath59 from table [ table01 ] the isotopes with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath23 and @xmath62 neutrons were considered . for each isotope ,",
    "the rvap procedure was carried with @xmath63 .",
    "the minimum of the rvap curve was retained as the physical solution for every isotope .",
    "the two - neutron separation energy was calculated from the total rvap - projected energies : @xmath64 .",
    "the criterion @xmath65 was used to define the position of the new drip line .",
    "table [ table02 ] shows the two - neutron drip line nuclei with and without the particle - number projection .",
    "these two drip lines differ by the isotopes of 6 elements : @xmath66mg@xmath67 , @xmath68ca@xmath69 , @xmath70cr@xmath71 , @xmath72sn@xmath73 , @xmath74pt@xmath75 and @xmath76pu@xmath77 .",
    "as we can read in the neutron number of these nuclei the differences arise always close to the shell closures , where the pairing correlations are either very weak or vanishing .",
    "for all the elements located at the rvap drip line , the helm radius was computed , for the protons and the neutrons , based on the projected density @xmath78 .",
    "the quantity @xmath79 obtained from these calculations is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] , together with the original @xmath80 of the two un - projected drip lines ( @xmath58 and @xmath81 drip line ) .     for rvap - projected ( plain squares ) , @xmath58-unprojected ( open circles ) and @xmath81-unprojected ( plain circles ) drip lines .",
    "all results are based on spherical gogny hfb calculations in the ws basis with the d1s interaction .",
    ", width=340,height=264 ]    the impact of particle - number projection is only significant in those nuclei that are unbound at the hfb level but bound in the rvap - hfb . as can be seen from table [ table02 ] , there are many nuclei that are particle - unstable ( @xmath82 ) but two - particle - stable ( @xmath65 ) . in such cases ,",
    "the halo is of course larger , sometimes significantly larger like e.g. cr or fe , than the corresponding particle - stable isotope .",
    "moreover the value of the halo calculated at the rvap minimum closely follows the one calculated at the @xmath58 drip line .",
    "the case of cr is singular , in that the rvap mechanism changes the two neutron drip line by 4 units , thereby considerably lowering the halo .",
    "however , beyond @xmath83 , the differences between all approaches become relatively negligible .",
    "this goes along a very clear and definite trend towards smaller halos as the mass of the nucleus increases . combining this observation with the fact that our mean - field approach , which includes the continuum and uses the best possible treatment of pairing correlations , fails to produce halos in light nuclei , it is tempting to conclude that halos are a trademark of few - body correlations only . as was recognized early , pairing correlations",
    "are a pre - requisite to the formation of halos in a mean - field approach indeed",
    ". however , our work seems to further indicate that additional correlations beyond the symmetry conserving mean - field approximation are also mandatory .",
    "figure [ fig08 ] may suggest that for rvap solutions the projected density profile is markedly different from the unprojected density . as mentioned",
    "already , only the projected density bears a physical meaning by construction .",
    "the underlying hfb solution is only used to generate a set of highly pair - correlated projected wave functions .",
    "nevertheless one may compare the behavior of @xmath84 when using either the projected density @xmath78 in the rvap minimum or the underlying un - projected hfb density @xmath85 in this same minimum to visualize the impact of projection itself .",
    "the difference in @xmath84 is practically negligible ( less than 0.01 fm ) and certainly not on the same scale as differences coming from the interaction .",
    "we have also applied the rvap formalism to the calculation of neutron skins and we do not find any remarkable difference as compared with the hfb ones . this confirms the observation that neutron skins are , from a theoretical point of view , mostly sensitive to the details of the interaction ( iso - scalar vs. iso - vector content ) , and from an experimental point of view , to the neutron excess but are not directly affected by the vicinity of the continuum .    in conclusion , we applied our method to include continuum effects in spherical self - consistent hfb calculations with finite - range forces of the gogny type to the case of nuclear halos and skins .",
    "our calculations show that both the d1 and d1s parametrizations of the gogny force lead to relatively small mean - field halos , that are of comparable size to most of the results obtained in skyrme - hfb or relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theories .",
    "in particular , we do not find the giant halos in neon and zirconium isotopes that were reported in several publications . as a rule of thumb we observe that the size of the halo tends to decrease as the mass of the nucleus increases and only light nuclei feature decent - sized halos .",
    "by contrast , neutron skins are found to be very clearly related to the ratio ( n - z)/a .",
    "we also show that the impact of particle number projection , before variation , is relatively important since it can change the position of the drip line .",
    "however , we find that particle - number projected continuum - coupled hfb theory , employing the most realistic form of the pairing interaction , can not reproduce the large halos observed experimentally in very light nuclei such as @xmath86li .",
    "this suggests a series of necessary conditions for a successful description of nuclear halos in the framework of mean - field theory : ( i ) the continuum must be properly included in the formalism ( ii ) the shell structure must be realistic enough ( iii ) pairing correlations must be present ( iv ) symmetry - breaking mean - field calculations , including all relevant deformation degrees of freedom , are probably mandatory ( v ) all such broken symmetries ( in particular particle number ) should then be restored ( vi ) probably configuration mixing such as e.g. gcm should also be included .",

    "<S> we review the properties of nuclear halos and nuclear skins in drip line nuclei in the framework of the spherical hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory with continuum effects and projection on good particle number with the gogny force . </S>",
    "<S> we first establish the position of the un - projected hfb drip lines for the two most employed parametrizations of the gogny force and show that the use of finite - range interactions leads almost always to small - sized halos , even in the least bound nuclei , which is in agreement with most mean - field predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the size of the neutron skin at the drip line and its relation to neutron asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of particle - number projection and its conceptual consequences near the drip line are analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss the role of the chemical potential in a projected theory and the criteria required to define the drip line . </S>",
    "<S> we show that including particle number projection can shift the latter , in particular near closed shells . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that , as a result , the size of the halo can be increased due to larger pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> however , combining the most realistic pairing interaction , a proper treatment of the continuum and particle number projection does not permit to reproduce the very large halos observed in very light nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> neutron - rich nuclei present us with unique opportunities to test nuclear models . as the asymmetry between the number of neutrons and protons in atomic nuclei increases , </S>",
    "<S> a number of new phenomena appear such as neutron skins , nuclear halos or shell - melting @xcite . with current and on - going developments of radioactive ion beam facilities , new territories of the nuclear chart </S>",
    "<S> are open to exploration and data from very neutron - rich nuclei is likely to upset the existing theories @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the so - called nuclear skin in neutron - rich nuclei is caused to a large extent by the isospin asymmetry . in the mean - field picture of the atomic nucleus , it should therefore depend mostly on the iso - vector component of the effective hamiltonian or lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the understanding of nuclear halos in the context of mean - field theories is quite fragmentary and it is not clear if one can relate this phenomenon to a particular term of the effective interaction or density functional . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme difficulties to approach the drip lines in heavy nuclei , where mean - field theories are most often employed , also forbids to test the calculations against experiment . in light nuclei , where experimental data is available , few - body models that introduce a core surrounded by one ( two - body models ) or two particles ( three - body models ) are very successful @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however mean - field models are notoriously unreliable in these extremely light systems unless severe corrections beyond the mean - field are included .    </S>",
    "<S> in heavy nuclei it is commonly thought that nuclear halos should be interpreted as resulting from the coupling to the continuum via residual interactions such as pairing correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial delocalization of continuum states gives a simple motivation for such interpretations . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless mean - field theories show significant variations in their predictions of halos . </S>",
    "<S> several major difficulties can explain these discrepancies : firstly , the neutron drip line is not known beyond the oxygen element . </S>",
    "<S> this lack of experimental data is going to be partially filled in the near future but imply that models can not really be benchmarked against experiment . </S>",
    "<S> secondly all self - consistent approaches to nuclear structure rely on the parametrization of some effective interaction , lagrangian , or energy density functional . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolability of such interactions to regions of very large neutron excess is by no means guaranteed by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , beyond mean - field effects such as symmetry restoration mechanisms or configuration mixing might be playing a different role in these extreme regions as in the valley of stability .    </S>",
    "<S> in a recent article , we proposed @xcite a simple and effective method to treat the continuum in configuration space for mean - field theories based on finite - range interactions of the gogny type . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that our procedure provides the correct asymptotic behavior of the nuclear wave - functions and established the proton and neutron drip lines with the d1s interaction . </S>",
    "<S> restoration of the particle number symmetry was also discussed and it was found that in some cases , in particular when the neutron number is near a closed shell , the variation after projection ( vap ) method could shift the position of the drip lines by 2 neutrons . in this paper , we apply our method to the specific problems of nuclear skins and nuclear halos near the neutron drip line . </S>",
    "<S> we will furthermore review several cases that have been proposed in the past , either in the framework of the skyrme hartree - fock bogoliubov theory or the relativistic mean - field and discuss the impact both of finite - range interaction and symmetry restoration effects . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes the first attempt to address this problem in explicitly symmetry - conserving mean - field approach . in section </S>",
    "<S> i we briefly recall the main features of our approach as well as the helm model that has been traditionally used to describe nuclear halos . in section ii we discuss the nuclear skins and halos in the standard framework of the hfb theory with the gogny interaction . in section </S>",
    "<S> iii we investigate the impact of particle - number symmetry restoration on halos . </S>"
