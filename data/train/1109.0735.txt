    "understanding ion channeling and blocking in crystals is important in the interpretation of direct dark matter experiments measuring ionization or scintillation signals . in the `` channeling effect '' ions incident upon a crystal along",
    "symmetry axes and planes suffer a series of small - angle scatterings that maintain them in the open `` channels '' between the rows or planes of lattice atoms and thus lose their energy predominantly to electrons ( while non - channeled ions transfer most of their energy to lattice nuclei ) .",
    "the `` blocking effect '' consists in a reduction of the flux of ions originating in lattice sites along symmetry axes and planes due to the shadowing effect of the lattice atoms directly in front of the emitting lattice site  @xcite .",
    "the potential importance of the channeling effect for direct dark matter detection was first pointed out for nai ( tl ) by drobyshevski  @xcite and subsequently by the dama collaboration  @xcite .",
    "when na or i ions recoiling after a collision with a dark matter wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) move along crystal axes and planes , their quenching factor is approximately @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , since they give their energy to electrons .",
    "the dama collaboration estimated the fraction of channeled recoils and found it to be large for low recoiling energies in the kev range .",
    "this effect considerably shifts the regions in cross section versus mass of acceptable wimp models in agreement with the dama data towards lower wimp masses . as a consequence",
    ", the comparison between the dama results and the null results of other experiments is affected too  @xcite .    in 2008 ,",
    "avignone , creswick , and nussinov  @xcite suggested that ion channeling in nai crystals could give rise to a daily modulation of the dark matter signal .",
    "such a modulation of the rate due to channeling is expected to occur at some level because the `` wimp wind '' arrives to earth on average from a particular direction fixed to the galaxy .",
    "assuming that the dark matter halo is on average at rest with respect to the galaxy , this is the direction towards which the earth moves with respect to the galaxy .",
    "earth s daily rotation naturally changes the direction of the `` wimp wind '' with respect to the crystal axes , thus changing the amount of recoiling ions that are channeled vs.  non - channeled .",
    "this amounts to a daily modulation of the dark matter signal detectable via scintillation or ionization .",
    "in addition to the daily modulation due to channeling , there exists a daily modulation in the usual ( i.e. non - channeled ) signal rate which is due purely to the change of wimp kinetic energy in the lab frame as the earth rotates around itself .",
    "this means that the number and energy of wimps above threshold in the lab frame changes during a day . if measured , the daily modulation due to channeling or in the usual rate would be a background free dark matter signature .    my collaborators , graciela gelmini and paolo gondolo , and i",
    "@xcite have evaluated the upper bounds on the channeling fractions for different crystalline detectors used in dark matter experiments through analytical means . to calculate the amplitude of the daily modulation in nai crystals , we compute the event rate during a day using the channeling fractions and",
    "the actual differential recoil spectrum and taking into account channeled and non - channeled recoils .",
    "we also examine the possibility that such a daily modulation might be observable in the data accumulated by the dama collaboration .",
    "our calculation of the channeling fractions as function of recoil energy is based on the classical analytic models which started to be developed in the 1960 s and 70 s . in particular",
    "we use lindhard s model  @xcite , supplemented by the planar channel models of morgan and van vliet  @xcite and the work of hobler  @xcite on low energy channeling . in these models",
    "the rows and planes of lattice atoms are replaced by continuum strings and planes , in which the screened thomas - fermi potential is averaged over a direction parallel to a row or a plane .",
    "the continuous potential , @xmath3 is considered to be uniformly smeared along the row or plane of atoms , which is a good approximation if the propagating ion interacts by a correlated series of many consecutive glancing collisions with lattice atoms in the row or plane .",
    "just one row or plane is considered in this model .",
    "lindhard proved that for an ion propagating with kinetic energy @xmath4 , and for small angle @xmath5 between the ion s trajectory and the atomic row ( or plane ) in the direction perpendicular to the row ( or plane ) , the so called `` transverse energy '' , @xmath6 is conserved .",
    "the conservation of the transverse energy provides a definition of the minimum distance of approach to the string ( or plane ) of atoms , @xmath7 , at which the trajectory of the ion makes a zero angle with the string ( or plane ) , and also of the angle @xmath8 at which the ion exits from the string ( or plane ) , i.e. far away from it where @xmath9 . channeling requires that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the smallest possible minimum distance of approach of the propagating ion with the row ( or plane ) for a given energy @xmath4 .",
    "this amounts to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the maximum angle the ion can make with the string far away from it ( i.e. in the middle of the channel ) if the ion is channeled .",
    "the channeling of ions in a crystal depends not only on the angle their initial trajectory makes with strings or planes in the crystal , but also on their initial position .",
    "ions which start their motion close to the center of a channel , far from a string or plane , where they make an angle @xmath8 , are channeled if the angle is smaller than a critical angle ( as explain earlier ) and are not channeled otherwise .",
    "particles which start their motion in the middle of a channel ( as opposed to a lattice site ) must be incident upon the crystal .",
    "no data or simulations of na and i ions propagating in a nai crystal is available at low energies .",
    "we show that to a good approximation we can use analytic calculations and reproduce the channeling fraction in nai presented in ref .",
    "temperature corrections are neglected and we use a static lattice ( similar to the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for an incident angle @xmath8 with respect to each of the channels and an ion energy @xmath4 ,",
    "the fraction of channeled incident ions for axial and planar channels is 1 if @xmath8 is smaller than the critical angle for the corresponding channel and zero otherwise .     with the static lattice without (",
    "dot dashed lines ) and with ( solid lines ) dechanneling due to interactions with tl impurities .",
    "the results of dama are also included ( dashed lines).,title=\"fig : \" ]   with the static lattice without ( dot dashed lines ) and with ( solid lines ) dechanneling due to interactions with tl impurities .",
    "the results of dama are also included ( dashed lines).,title=\"fig : \" ]    to find the total fraction of channeled incident nuclei , we integrate the direction - dependent channeling fraction over the incident direction .",
    "the integral can not be solved analytically , so we integrate numerically by performing a riemann sum once the sphere of directions has been divided using the hierarchical equal area iso - latitude pixelization ( healpix )  @xcite .",
    "healpix uses an algorithm to deal with the pixelization of data on a sphere , and it is useful to compute integrals over direction by dividing the surface of a sphere into many pixels , computing the integrand at each pixel ( i.e. each direction , see fig .",
    "[ dama].a ) , and finally summing up the values of all pixels over the sphere .    a channeled ion can be pushed out of a channel by an interaction with an impurity such as the atoms of tl in nai ( tl ) .",
    "here we simply assume that if a channeled ion interacts with a tl atom it becomes dechanneled and thus it does not contribute to the fully channeled fraction any longer .",
    "we thus neglect the possibility that after the interaction the ion may reenter into a channel , either the same or another .",
    "figure [ dama].a shows the axial and planar channels of the nai crystal for incoming na ions with an energy of 50 kev .",
    "we include here only the channels with lower crystallographic indices , i.e. 100 , 110 and 111 , which provide the dominant contribution to the channeling fraction , as is also done in ref .",
    "the fraction of channeled incident na or i ions as a function of their incident energy @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "[ dama].b . for comparison ,",
    "[ dama].b also shows the channeling fraction obtained by dama .",
    "good agreement with the channeling fractions of dama is achieved only when dechanneling due to the interaction with tl impurities is included .",
    "the recoiling nuclei start initially from lattice sites ( or very close to them ) , thus blocking effects are important .",
    "in fact , as argued originally by lindhard  @xcite , in a perfect lattice and in the absence of energy - loss processes the probability that a particle starting from a lattice site is channeled would be zero .",
    "the argument uses statistical mechanics in which the probability of particle paths related by time - reversal is the same .",
    "thus the probability of an incoming ion to have a particular path within the crystal is the same as the probability of the same ion to move backwards along the same path  @xcite .",
    "this is what lindhard called the  rule of reversibility \" .",
    "using this rule , since the probability of an incoming channeled ion to get very close to a lattice site is zero , the probability of the same ion to move in the time - reversed path , starting at a nuclear site and ending inside a channel is also zero .",
    "however , any departure of the actual lattice from a perfect lattice , for example due to vibrations of the atoms in the lattice , would violate the conditions of this argument and allow for some of the recoiling lattice nuclei to be channeled , as already understood in the 70 s  @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "a recoiling ion is channeled if the collision ion - wimp happens at a distance large enough from the string or plane to which the ion belongs .",
    "namely , channeling happens if the initial position of the recoiling motion is @xmath14 .",
    "we define @xmath15 in terms of the initial recoil energy @xmath4 of the propagating ion , the angle of the initial recoil momentum with respect to the particular string or plane of atoms @xmath16 , and the initial position @xmath17 . since the potential @xmath18 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and the condition @xmath21 i.e. @xmath22 defines the distance @xmath23 in terms of @xmath24 .",
    "we take the initial distance distribution , @xmath17 of the colliding atom to be a gaussian with a one dimensional rms vibration amplitude @xmath25 ( using the debye model ) , and we obtain the probability of channeling for each individual channel by integrating the gaussian between the minimum initial distance and infinity ( a good approximation to the radius of the channel ) .",
    "the dependence of these probabilities on the critical distances enter in the argument of an exponential ( for axial channels ) or an erfc function ( for planar channels ) . in order to obtain the total geometric channeling fraction we sum over all the individual channels we consider .",
    "the integral over initial directions is computed using healpix .",
    "figure [ fracnai - final ] shows what we consider to be our main predictions for the range expected as an upper limit to the channeling fraction in nai at 239 k. the parameter @xmath26 mentioned in the figure is a number that we expect to be between 1 and 2 , which regulates the importance of temperature corrections .",
    "the channeling fractions are typically smaller for larger values of @xmath26 .",
    "notice that we have not included any dechanneling effects due to impurities or dopants , which should also decrease the channeling fractions . using the fractions in fig .",
    "[ fracnai - final ] , the difference in the regions of cross section versus mass of acceptable wimp models corresponding to the dama annual modulation signal differs only at 7@xmath27 if channeling is included or not included  @xcite . in the absence of channeling ,",
