    "with the present article we would like to further promote the effective lagrangian method in the condensed matter domain  in particular , we would like to demonstrate its efficiency in describing the thermodynamic properties of systems exhibiting collective magnetic behavior .",
    "while the low - energy properties of antiferromagnets in dimension @xmath1=3 + 1 have previously been investigated within the effective lagrangian framework @xcite , in the present study we focus our attention on antiferromagnets in dimension @xmath1=2 + 1 .",
    "a thorough analysis of these condensed matter systems , using effective field theory methods , was performed in refs .",
    "however , in the present paper , we go one step further in the perturbative expansion , taking into account contributions to the free energy density up to three - loop order .",
    "our calculation applies to any system with a spontaneously broken internal symmetry o(@xmath0 )",
    "@xmath4 o(@xmath0 - 1 ) , provided that the corresponding leading - order effective lagrangian can be brought to a lorentz - invariant form .",
    "this system will be referred to as o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnet . throughout the paper ,",
    "when talking about dimension , we always refer to the space - time dimension @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the spatial dimension .",
    "the attentive reader may particularly wonder why the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet , @xmath7 falls into the class of o(3 ) antiferromagnets , i.e. , represents a system described by a lorentz - invariant leading - order effective lagrangian .",
    "after all , the lattice structure of a solid singles out preferred directions , such that the effective lagrangian in general is not even invariant under space rotations . in the case of a cubic lattice",
    ", however , the anisotropy only shows up at higher orders of the derivative expansion @xcite  the discrete symmetries of the three - dimensional cubic crystal thus imply space rotation symmetry at leading order in the effective expansion .",
    "the same is true for an antiferromagnet defined on a square or a honeycomb lattice , which represents the system considered in this paper .",
    "hence , the leading - order effective lagrangian describing the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on a cubic ( d=3 + 1 ) or square / honeycomb ( d=2 + 1 ) lattice is invariant under space rotations and can be brought to a ( pseudo- ) lorentz - invariant form @xcite : antiferromagnetic spin - wave excitations exhibit relativistic kinematics , with the velocity of light replaced by the spin - wave velocity . as we will explain in detail later on , the spatial anisotropies",
    "which indeed start manifesting themselves at next - to - leading order in the effective lagrangian , will not affect at all the main result of the present paper .",
    "hence , a lorentz - invariant framework , even at next - to - leading order of the derivative expansion , is perfectly justified in our calculation .",
    "goldstone s theorem , which represents the basis of the systematic effective lagrangian method , states that , if the symmetry g = o(@xmath0 ) of the lagrangian is spontaneously broken to h = o(@xmath0 - 1 ) , we must have @xmath0 - 1 goldstone bosons in the broken phase ( @xmath8 ) . for @xmath0=3 ,",
    "these low - energy degrees of freedom are identified with the two spin - wave excitations  or the two independent magnon particles  in the spectrum of the o(3 ) antiferromagnet .",
    "if the perturbations , which explicitly break the internal rotation symmetry o(@xmath0 ) of the lagrangian , are small , the corresponding goldstone excitations remain light and dominate the low - energy behavior of the system .",
    "the effective lagrangian method thus also applies to antiferromagnets in weak external fields .",
    "goldstone s theorem guarantees that the goldstone particles interact only weakly at low energies such that a systematic perturbative expansion in the momenta and the external fields can be performed . in the present work",
    "we perturbatively evaluate the partition function in a power series of the temperature , in order to obtain low - temperature theorems for various quantities of physical interest .",
    "we would like to emphasize that , from the effective lagrangian perspective , the analysis of the low - energy properties of the system is approached from a unified and model - independent point of view , based on the spontaneously broken symmetry of the system .",
    "the method applies to any system where the goldstone bosons are the only excitations without energy gap .",
    "the essential point is that the properties of these low - energy degrees of freedom and their mutual interaction are strongly constrained by the symmetries inherent in the underlying theory , such as the heisenberg hamiltonian  the specific nature of the underlying theory or model , however , is not important . for general pedagogic introductions to the effective lagrangian technique",

    "to condensed matter systems the reader may consult refs .",

    "although our analysis is general , referring to any system which exhibits a spontaneously broken symmetry o(@xmath0 )",
    "@xmath4 o(@xmath0 - 1 ) and a lorentz - invariant leading - order effective lagrangian , our interest will primarily be devoted to the special case @xmath0=3 , which describes the o(3 ) heisenberg antiferromagnet in @xmath1=2 + 1 defined on a square or a honeycomb lattice . here",
    "the internal o(3 ) spin symmetry of the isotropic heisenberg model is spontaneously broken by the ground state which displays a non - zero staggered magnetization .",
    "this system has been widely studied in condensed matter physics and it will be instructive to compare our results with the findings derived within the microscopic heisenberg model .",
    "as we will see , the effective field theory approach is by far more powerful than spin - wave theory .",
    "apart from our specific application concerning the partition function of the o(3 ) antiferromagnet in @xmath1=2 + 1 up to three - loop accuracy , we would like to point out that the effective field theory approach to this condensed matter system has also proven to be very efficient in other applications : in particular , in a recent publication on the constraint effective potential of the staggered magnetization of the o(3 ) antiferromagnet @xcite , the quantitative correctness of the magnon effective field theory has been demonstrated in great detail at permille level accuracy by comparison with monte carlo simulations of the quantum heisenberg model using the very efficient loop - cluster algorithm . at this accuracy ,",
    "three - loop effects clearly start manifesting themselves as there are small discrepancies between the monte carlo data and the two - loop predictions of the effective field theory .",
    "indeed , it would be interesting to extend the finite - volume effective field theory formulas for the constraint effective potential to three loops and to confirm the correctness of the effective field theory approach on an even higher level of accuracy . while this finite - volume calculation may be performed in a future study , in the present work we focus on finite temperature",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "for the sake of selfconsistency , in section [ method ] , we give a brief outline of the effective lagrangian method at finite temperature . in section [ feynman ]",
    "we present the evaluation of the partition function up to three - loop order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "the issue of renormalization is then discussed in section [ divergences ] .",
    "section [ results ] contains our main results , i.e. , the low - temperature series for the free energy density and other thermodynamic quantities up to three - loop order . in section [ justification ]",
    "we justify why it is legitimate to use a ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant framework in our calculation .",
    "we then compare in section [ comparison ] our results which apply to o(3 ) antiferromagnets in three dimensions with those for o(3 ) antiferromagnets in four dimensions .",
    "finally , section [ summary ] contains our conclusions , while some technical details concerning the renormalization and the evaluation of a specific three - loop graph are relegated to three appendices .",
    "in a lorentz - invariant framework the construction of effective lagrangians is straightforward @xcite : one writes down the most general expression consistent with lorentz symmetry and the internal , spontaneously broken symmetry g of the underlying model in terms of goldstone fields @xmath9 , dim(g)-dim(h )  the effective lagrangian then consists of a string of terms involving an increasing number of derivatives or , equivalently , amounts to an expansion in powers of the momentum .",
    "furthermore , the effective lagrangian method allows to systematically take into account interactions which explicitly break the symmetry g of the underlying model , provided that they can be treated as perturbations .    in the particular case we are considering ,",
    "the symmetry g = o(@xmath0 ) is explicitly broken by an external field .",
    "it is convenient to collect the ( @xmath0 - 1 ) goldstone fields @xmath10 in a @xmath0-dimensional vector @xmath11 of unit length , @xmath12 and to take the constant external field along the zeroth axis , @xmath13 .",
    "the euclidean form of the effective lagrangian up to and including order @xmath14 then reads @xcite : @xmath15 in the momentum power counting scheme , the field @xmath16 counts as a quantity of order 1 .",
    "derivatives correspond to one power of the momentum , @xmath17 , whereas the external field @xmath18 counts as a term of order @xmath19 .",
    "hence , at leading order ( @xmath20 ) we have two coupling constants , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while at next - to - leading order ( @xmath23 ) already five constants , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , show up . note that these couplings are not fixed by symmetry ",
    "they parametrize the physics of the underlying theory and have to be determined either experimentally or in a numerical simulation . using magnetic terminology ,",
    "the square of the effective coupling constant @xmath21 is the spin stiffness , while for the o(3 ) antiferromagnet the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath26 represent the staggered magnetization and the staggered external field , respectively .",
    "the effective lagrangian method provides us with a simultaneous expansion of physical quantities in powers of the momenta and of the external field .",
    "the essential point is that , to a given order in the low - energy expansion , only a finite number of coupling constants and only a finite number of graphs contribute .",
    "the leading terms stem from tree graphs , whereas loop graphs only manifest themselves at higher orders in the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "a crucial difference with respect to the effective analysis in four space - time dimensions concerns the suppression of loops in feynman graphs : while loops are suppressed by _ two _ momentum powers in four space - time dimensions , in three space - time dimensions loop corrections are suppressed by only _",
    "one _ power of momentum @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of feynman graphs that contribute to the perturbative expansion of the partition function up to a given order @xmath27 , will depend on the space - time dimension . as we will see in the next section , there are fewer graphs in three dimensions that contribute up to three - loop order .",
    "the effective lagrangian technique can readily be extended to finite temperature @xcite . in the partition function ,",
    "contributions of massive particles are suppressed exponentially , such that the goldstone bosons dominate the properties of the system at low temperatures . in the power counting rules ,",
    "the role of the external momenta is taken over by the temperature , which is treated as a small quantity of order @xmath28 .",
    "the interaction among the goldstone degrees of freedom in three dimensions generates corrections of order @xmath29 , while in four dimensions , the corrections are of order @xmath30 .    in the effective lagrangian framework at finite temperature , the partition function is represented as a euclidean functional integral @xcite , @xmath31 \\ , = \\ , \\int [ { \\mbox{d}}u ] \\ , \\exp \\big ( - { \\int}_{\\!\\!\\ ! { \\cal t } } \\ ! { \\mbox{d}}^4x \\ , { \\cal l}_{eff } \\big ) \\ , .\\ ] ] the integration is performed over all field configurations which are periodic in the euclidean time direction , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 .",
    "the low - temperature expansion of the partition function is obtained by considering the fluctuations of the field @xmath34 around the ground state @xmath35 , i.e. by expanding @xmath36 in powers of @xmath10 , @xmath37 . the leading contribution ( order @xmath19 )",
    "contains a term quadratic in @xmath10 which describes free ( pseudo-)goldstone bosons of mass @xmath38 the remainder of the effective lagrangian is treated as a perturbation . evaluating the gaussian integrals in the standard manner , one arrives at a set of feynman rules which differ from the conventional rules of the effective lagrangian method only in one respect : the periodicity condition imposed on the goldstone field modifies the propagator . at finite temperature , the propagator is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the euclidean propagator at zero temperature .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the infinite volume limit and evaluate the free energy density @xmath41 , defined by @xmath42 \\ , .\\ ] ]    to evaluate the graphs of the effective theory , it is convenient to use dimensional regularization , since the symmetries of the theory are preserved within this scheme .",
    "the zero - temperature propagator then reads @xmath43",
    "our aim is to evaluate the partition function of an o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnet in dimension @xmath1=2 + 1 up to three - loop order  the relevant feynman graphs are shown in fig.[figure1 ] .    at leading order ( order @xmath19 )",
    ", we have a tree graph involving @xmath2 .",
    "the next order is @xmath44 , where we have a one - loop graph .",
    "remember that in three dimensions every loop leads to a suppression of one momentum power only . at order @xmath14",
    "the next - to - leading order lagrangian @xmath3 contributes to a tree graph , while the leading lagrangian @xmath2 manifests itself in the form of a two - loop graph .",
    "the situation is more involved at order @xmath45 , where we have three three - loop graphs with insertions from @xmath2 , as well as a one - loop graph involving @xmath3 .",
    "note that higher - order pieces of the effective lagrangian , starting with @xmath46 , are not relevant for the evaluation of the partition function in @xmath1=2 + 1 at the three - loop level .    in order to compare our three - loop calculation in 2 + 1 dimensions with the one referring to the evaluation of the partition function for an o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnet in 3 + 1 dimensions , we have displayed the relevant graphs for the latter case in fig.[figure2 ] .",
    "note that loops are now suppressed by two momentum powers , which leads to fourteen diagrams up to the three - loop level , whereas in three dimensions we only have eight diagrams . as we will see later on , the different loop counting and thus different organization of feynman graphs",
    "reflects itself also in the renormalization of these graphs which turns out to be less involved in three dimensions .",
    "let us now consider the case @xmath1=2 + 1 and address the contributions from the relevant feynman graphs of fig.[figure1 ] individually .",
    "at order @xmath19 , the tree graph involving the leading - order effective lagrangian leads to a temperature - independent contribution , @xmath47    at order @xmath44 , the one - loop graph involving @xmath2 , which represents the free bose gas term , is given by @xmath48 the function @xmath49 is part of a set of kinematical functions @xmath50 and",

    "the tree graph 4a involves two coupling constants from the next - to - leading order lagrangian , @xmath53 while the two - loop graph 4b leads to a temperature - dependent contribution @xmath54 the expression @xmath55 denotes the value of the thermal propagator at the origin @xmath56    the situation is more complicated at order @xmath45 , where we have four graphs : the three - loop graphs 5a , 5b , and 5c , involving the leading - order effective lagrangian @xmath2 , as well as a one - loop graph with a vertex from the next - to - leading order lagrangian @xmath3 .",
    "graph 5a factorizes into a term which only involves the thermal propagator at the origin : @xmath57    likewise , graph 5b exclusively contains propagators or derivatives thereof evaluated at the origin , @xmath58 the quantity @xmath59 corresponds to an integral over the torus @xmath60 , with circle @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 , and reads @xmath63 this integral can be expressed in terms of the derivative of the propagator at the origin with respect to the mass , @xmath64    graph 5c leads to integrals over products of four propagators .",
    "integrating by parts , they can be brought to the form @xmath65 where the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by @xmath68    finally , the one - loop graph 5d with an insertion from @xmath3 yields @xmath69    collecting all the pieces , we obtain the following expression for the free energy density of an o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnet in dimension @xmath1=2 + 1 up to and including three loops : @xmath70 note that the quantities above involve the bare mass @xmath71 of the ( pseudo-)goldstone bosons given in eq.([gbmass ] ) .",
    "the thermodynamics of the antiferromagnet is contained in the functions @xmath72 , and @xmath67 which depend in a non - trivial manner on the ratio @xmath73 . in the following section",
    ", we will take care of the singularities contained in the above expression and derive the low - temperature expansion for the free energy density .",
    "in order to analyze the divergences in the limit @xmath74 , we split the thermal propagator into two pieces , @xmath75 where @xmath76 represents the propagator at zero temperature . at the origin , we have @xmath77 the temperature - dependent quantities @xmath78 , defined in eq.([bosefunctions ] ) , are smooth functions in the limit @xmath74 .",

    "accordingly , logarithmic divergences in the ultraviolet show up in four space - time dimensions , such that the next - to - leading order effective constants will undergo a logarithmic renormalization in @xmath1=3 + 1 . for the moment , however , we focus on the case @xmath1=2 + 1 .    in order to remove the singularities in the remaining integrals @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as we show in appendix a , it suffices to subtract counterterms of the form @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , @xmath85 where the constants @xmath86 are singular functions of the dimension @xmath1 . while the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 renormalize the vacuum energy , @xmath89 and @xmath90 renormalize the mass @xmath71 ( see below ) .",

    "next , we consider all terms in the free energy density ( [ freeenergydensityunrenormalized ] ) which are linear in the kinematical functions @xmath78 . in appendix",
    "b we show that these contributions can be merged into a single term proportional to @xmath92 by renormalizing the mass , @xmath93 , according to @xmath94 the quantity @xmath95 is related to the singularities contained in the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we thus see that the divergences in @xmath95 , originating from the three - loop graph 5c , are absorbed into the combination @xmath96 ( stemming from the one - loop graph 5d ) of next - to - leading order effective constants .",
    "after mass renormalization , the only surviving term linear in the kinematical function is the contribution from the free energy density of noninteracting magnons given by @xmath97 which now depends on the renormalized mass @xmath98",
    ".    finally we have to take care of the terms quadratic and cubic in the functions @xmath78 , which is also done in appendix b. we are then left with the following expression for the free energy density of an o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnet in three dimensions , @xmath99 where we have defined the function @xmath100 by @xmath101 the expression ( [ freeenergydensityg ] ) for the free energy density is free of divergences and only involves the physical mass @xmath98 . in particular , the kinematical functions are defined as @xmath102 .    for dimensional reasons , the thermodynamic functions in eq.([freeenergydensityg ] )",

    "the ratio @xmath108 can take any value , as long as the quantities @xmath109 and @xmath98 themselves are small compared to the intrinsic scale @xmath110 of the theory which , in the case of the o(3 ) antiferromagnet , may be identified with the exchange integral @xmath111 of the heisenberg model ( [ heisenbergmodel ] ) .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath112  the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice ",
    "most of the terms drop out and we are left with the following simple expression for the free energy density of the o(3 ) antiferromagnet in @xmath1=2 + 1 : @xmath113 while the term cubic in the temperature corresponds to the free bose gas , the term proportional to five powers of the temperature represents the leading contribution due to the spin - wave interaction .",
    "note that for this special case ( @xmath0=3 ) , the function @xmath114 defined in eq.([thermaldimensionless ] ) only involves the contribution proportional to @xmath115 .",

    "now the exchange integral defines a scale in the underlying theory and for the effective expansion to be consistent , the temperature has to be small with respect to this scale . assuming that @xmath146 relation ( [ npestimate ] ) then yields the ratio @xmath147",

    "while our effective calculation is restricted to the regime @xmath150 , the regime @xmath151 , is perfectly well accessible also with effective field theory methods .",
    "however , one has to resort to a different type of perturbative expansion .",
    "a similar situation occurs when one considers finite size effects : when the goldstone boson mass is small compared to the inverse size of the box , a different effective expansion scheme , the so - called @xmath152-expansion , applies . indeed",
    ", various problems within this framework have been investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "in this section we would like to explain why it is justified to use a lorentz - invariant framework in our calculation .",
    "we have seen that anisotropies induced by a cubic or a square lattice do not affect the leading - order effective lagrangian , such that @xmath2 can be written in a lorentz - invariant form , where the spin - wave velocity takes over the role of the velocity of light : the accidental o(3 ) space rotation symmetry at the @xmath2-level implies ( pseudo-)lorentz invariance . on the other hand",
    ", the anisotropies related to the lattice structure do show up in the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian @xmath3 .",
    "now , in our three - loop calculation of the partition function in @xmath1=2 + 1 the only temperature - dependent diagram involving @xmath3 is the one - loop diagram 5d , which is quadratic in the magnon field .",
    "indeed , here we have a new term due to the lattice anisotropies , also contributing to the diagram . the respective term , @xmath153 is invariant under the 90 degrees spatial rotation symmetry of the square lattice , but not invariant under continuous o(3 ) space rotations .",
    "interestingly , this term is absent in the case of the honeycomb lattice , as it is not allowed by the 60 degrees rotation symmetry .",
    "however , both for the square and the honeycomb lattice there are additional terms showing up at next - to - leading order : if we consider an o(3)-symmetric , i.e. , space - rotation symmetric lagrangian @xmath3  and not a lorentz - invariant lagrangian @xmath3 as we have done so far  there are further terms like @xmath154 that also have to be taken into account in @xmath3 .",
    "the essential observation , however , is that all these lorentz - noninvariant extra terms in eqs.([extraterm1 ] ) and ( [ extraterms2 ] ) contributing to the one - loop graph 5d merely modify mass renormalization or give rise to higher - order corrections of the dispersion law , @xmath155 but can not manifest themselves in the magnon - magnon interaction up to the order @xmath45 considered in the present work .",
    "although they give rise to an additional term in the free energy density involving five powers of the temperature , this is a purely kinematical effect related to the one - loop graph 5d  the leading contribution due to the magnon - magnon interaction , also of order @xmath133 , will not be affected .",
    "hence , our main result regarding the weakness and the repulsive character of the magnon - magnon interaction in the o(3 ) antiferromagnet in @xmath1=2 + 1 perfectly well applies to the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet defined on a square or a honeycomb lattice .",
    "in this section we want to compare the low - temperature series for antiferromagnets in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions , pointing out differences as well as similarities .",
    "the effective lagrangian method is ideally suited to understand the structure of these low - temperature series , as it adopts a unified perspective based on symmetry considerations .    as we have discussed in sec.[feynman ] , loops in four dimensions are suppressed by two momentum powers , whereas in three dimensions they are suppressed by one power of momentum only . consequently , the organization of the loop expansion for the partition function depends on the space - time dimension and reflects itself also in the number of feynman diagrams that have to be evaluated . up to the three - loop level , we have the fourteen diagrams in four dimensions , displayed in fig.[figure2 ]  in three dimensions there are only eight , displayed in fig.[figure1 ] . in particular , in @xmath1=2 + 1 , there are no two - loop graphs involving the next - to - leading order lagrangian @xmath3 . moreover ,",
    "contributions from @xmath46 or @xmath156 are not needed in @xmath1=2 + 1 .",
    "one thus notices that the restrictions imposed by symmetry are extremely strong in @xmath1=2 + 1 : up to the three - loop level , no effective coupling constants from @xmath46 or @xmath156 enter the calculation and the couplings in @xmath3  as we have seen  do not affect at all the spin - wave interaction part in the free energy density .",
    "another immediate consequence of the dimension - dependent loop counting is the fact that interactions among antiferromagnetic magnons in @xmath1=2 + 1 generate corrections of order @xmath29 , whereas in @xmath1=3 + 1 these corrections are of order @xmath30 .",

    "remarkably , the coefficient of this interaction term is fully determined by the leading - order effective lagrangian @xmath2 and does not involve any higher order effective constants from @xmath3  the symmetry is thus very restrictive in @xmath1=2 + 1 . as we have argued , additional effective constants in @xmath3 , taking into account the lorentz - noninvariant nature of the system , merely affect the renormalization of the magnon mass or yield higher - order corrections to the magnon dispersion law , but do not affect at all the leading contribution originating from the magnon - magnon interaction in the pressure .    the free energy density for o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnets in @xmath1=3 + 1 up to the three - loop level , on the other hand , does involve coupling constants from @xmath3 , which undergo logarithmic renormalization .",
    "accordingly , the effective expansion of thermodynamic quantities now contains a scale , related to these coupling constants in @xmath3 . in four dimensions , within the ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant framework , we thus need more phenomenological input , i.e. the numerical values of some next - to - leading order effective coupling constants , in order to fully specify the structure of the magnon - magnon interaction in the low - temperature series up to the three - loop level . still , the symmetry is also very restrictive here , as it unambiguously fixes the coefficients in the expansion of the free energy density of o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnets in @xmath1=3 + 1 up to order @xmath180 , where the logarithm involving the scale enters .",
    "the low - temperature theorems for the various thermodynamic quantities of o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnets in three and four space - time dimensions are exact up to and including three loops : independently of the specific underlying model , they are valid for any system with a spontaneously broken symmetry o(@xmath0 ) @xmath4 o(@xmath0 - 1 ) , provided that the system can be described in a ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant framework , with the velocity of light replaced by the spin - wave velocity .",
    "in particular , there are no approximations or idealizations involved in our main result regarding the weakness and the repulsive character of the magnon - magnon interaction in the o(3 ) antiferromagnet in @xmath1=2 + 1 : although we use a ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant framework , our calculation is not just some kind of academic exercise , as the lattice anisotropies , or the lorentz - noninvariant nature of the system in general , can not manifest themselves in the magnon - magnon interaction up to the three - loop order of the perturbative expansion , considered in the present paper  hence our calculation applies , as it stands , to the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet defined on a square or a honeycomb lattice .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the order of the calculation presented here , as we have argued in section [ results ] , appears to be beyond the reach of any realistic microscopic calculation based on spin - wave theory or other standard condensed matter methods methods , such as schwinger boson mean field theory .",
    "the fully systematic effective lagrangian method thus clearly proves to be more efficient than the complicated microscopic analysis .",
    "another virtue of the effective lagrangian technique is that it addresses the problem from a unified and model - independent point of view based on symmetry  at large wavelengths , the microscopic structure of the system only manifests itself in the numerical values of a few coupling constants .",

    "it turns out that , in order to renormalize the integral @xmath67 in @xmath1=3 + 1 , it is thus not sufficient to just subtract the two counterterms @xmath88 and @xmath90 in eq.([functionsjbarj3 ] )  rather , one has to subtract two more terms , @xmath227 in order to remove all singularities in @xmath67 .    in three dimensions ,",
    "as we have seen , the integral over the sphere on the left hand side of eq.([j2comparison ] ) is not singular . likewise",
    "the integral over all euclidean space on the right hand side is perfectly well defined , such that there is no need to introduce the above decomposition ( [ j2bargl ] ) in three dimensions in the first place . still , in order to check that",
    "our entire calculation is consistent , we have verified both analytically and numerically that the evaluation of the quantity @xmath115 via eqs.([j2bar ] ) and ( [ j2bargl ] ) yields the same result .",
    "we close this section with a comment regarding dimensional regularization and the different structure of the singularities in three and four dimensions , respectively .",
    "the essential point can be seen in the identity ( [ j2comparison ] ) which involves two thermal propagators . in four dimensions , as we have seen , the cateye graph is of order @xmath172 and so is the singularity occurring in the last term of eq.([j2comparison ] ) . now , in four dimensions we also have two - loop graphs which are of the same order @xmath172 : graphs 8d and 8e ( see fig.[figure2 ] ) which involve vertices from the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the singularities in the last term of eq.([j2comparison ] )  the integral over all euclidean space  can be absorbed into a combination of these next - to - leading order coupling constants .    in three dimensions , on the other hand , these two - loop graphs are of order @xmath194 , i.e. , beyond the order @xmath45 considered in the present work . loosely speaking ,",
    "there is no communication between the cateye graph ( order @xmath45 ) and these two - loop graphs of order @xmath194 and it so seems that  in three dimensions  the singularities in the last term of eq.([j2comparison ] ) can not be absorbed , as there are no next - to - leading order coupling constants available .",
    "however , in three dimensions the parameter @xmath79 arising in the last term of eq.([j2comparison ] ) is finite , such that the bookkeeping of divergences in three dimensions is perfectly consistent .",
    "in appendix b , we would like to derive the expression ( [ freeenergydensityg ] ) for the free energy density of an o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnet in @xmath1=2 + 1 .",
    "we first show that all the terms in the free energy density ( [ freeenergydensityunrenormalized ] ) that are linear in the kinematical functions @xmath78 can be merged into a single such function , namely @xmath228 , by replacing the bare mass @xmath71 with the physical mass @xmath98 .    with the decompositions ( [ decomposition ] ) and ( [ decompositionj ] ) , the terms in the free energy density ( [ freeenergydensityunrenormalized ] ) linear in @xmath78",

    "note that in @xmath1=2 + 1 the parameter @xmath79 is finite , such that second term on the right hand side of eq.([massrenormalization ] ) , coming from the two - loop graph 4b , does not contain any singularities .",
    "one readily verifies that the replacement @xmath240 in the first term of eq.([glinear ] ) cancels all other terms linear in @xmath78 .",

    "they are @xmath242 in the first term we make the replacement @xmath243 , which amounts to @xmath244 one notices that this cancels the third term in eq.([freeenergydensityquadratic ] ) .",
    "we are thus left with @xmath245 note that in the second term we have also replaced the bare mass by the physical mass , both in the prefactor and in the kinematical function : this is legitimate as the difference is beyond our accuracy . finally , in the prefactor of the first term",
    ", we also express the bare mass by the physical mass using relation ( [ massrenormalization ] ) , obtaining the following terms in the free energy density quadratic in the kinematical functions : @xmath246    to end up , we take care of the remaining terms in the free energy density that are either cubic in the kinematical functions @xmath78 or are related to integrals over the torus : @xmath247 again , we replace the bare mass by the physical mass in the above terms , both in the kinematical functions and in the prefactors , as the difference is beyond our accuracy .",
    "no cancellations of terms occur here .    collecting the various contributions , we arrive at the expression for the free energy density of an o(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnet in @xmath1=2 + 1 : @xmath248 note that only the physical mass @xmath98 occurs in the above formula : in particular , the kinematical functions are @xmath102",
