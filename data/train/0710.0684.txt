    "the notion of controlling quantum systems seems inherently problematic on several counts .",
    "first , the extreme sensitivity of quantum systems to environmental interactions would appear to place limits on the maximal achievable control fidelity .",
    "second , from a numerical perspective , given the considerable cost of propagating the schrodinger equation , unless the search space for optimal controls has particularly simple properties , it would appear impossible to locate controls for all but the smallest quantum systems in reasonable time .",
    "however , once the methods of optimal control began to be applied to molecular systems ( thanks to remarkable advances in laser pulse shaping technology ) it rapidly became clear that quantum control was not an ill - fated concept , but rather , that controlling quantum systems was surprisingly easy . in the laboratory , this conclusion was particularly apparent in the case of so - called adaptive learning control of quantum dynamics , wherein learning ( i.e. , typically genetic ) algorithms are applied to search the space of laser control parameters for the maximization of the expectation value of a quantum observable .",
    "this search space is high - dimensional , normally suggesting that it should be replete with local optima and other unfavorable features that would trap unsophisticated search algorithms , especially in the presence of environmental decoherence .",
    "the repeated successes of quantum optimal control experiments and simulations indicated that the so - called `` curse of dimensionality '' , common in the theory of optimization in high - dimensional spaces , was not prohibitive here .",
    "this attractive circumstance for quantum control rests on the mathematical underpinnings of quantum theory being surprisingly simple , owing to the linearity of quantum mechanics and the unitarity of the accompanying transformations .",
    "although quantum systems can be highly sensitive to environmental perturbations , the rules governing their dynamics are in many ways simpler than those governing classical dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the presence of an environment , rather than being an impediment , may under the right conditions aid the control process .",
    "recent work has aimed to understand the precise mathematical properties of quantum mechanics are responsible for the surprising simplicity with which quantum phenomena can be controlled .",
    "analytical , numerical and experimental treatments of the problem have been explored . in order to enable the systematic study of these features , the notion of a quantum control landscape , defined as the map between the space of time - dependent controls and associated values of the objective functional , was introduced ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] ) .    from an analytical perspective",
    ", it was recently found that for several classes of low - dimensional problems , it is possible to exactly solve for quantum optimal controls , without any need for numerical search .",
    "by contrast , for the analogous classical problems , analytical solutions do not exist .",
    "of course , analytical solutions are still only possible for special small systems ; however , beyond this , it has become clear that the numerical or experimental search for optimal controls is often easier for quantum systems than for classical systems . in this regard ,",
    "the topology of the search space is of fundamental importance .",
    "evidence suggests that the landscapes for both observable maximization and control of dynamical transformations have simpler topological properties for quantum versus classical systems , contributing to rapid convergence of numerical or experimental searches for effective controls .",
    "moreover , besides the simplicity of locating quantum controls , it has been observed that the controls themselves have remarkably simple functional properties , in some cases enabling a direct interpretation of the mechanisms involved in steering about the dynamics .",
    "the ease of locating optimal quantum controls , and the comparatively simple structure of these controls , have pervasive implications for a wide range of quantum technologies .",
    "the study of quantum control landscapes is motivated by the practical goals of achieving higher objective function yields and designing control fields with desired properties , but in order to attain these goals , it is necessary to embrace the mathematical framework that underlies the remarkable properties of these landscapes .",
    "the origin of these counterintuitive properties , and their differences with respect to classical control , constitute the primary subject of this review .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we examine the topology of solution sets to quantum observable and unitary transformation control problems . section iii reviews the analytical solutions obtained for low - dimensional quantum control problems . in section iv , we consider numerical studies of the solution sets to higher dimensional quantum control problems without analytical solution , focusing on the degeneracy in the set of controls that reach the same objective .",
    "then , section v reviews experimental work that has probed the structure of these level sets of multiple solutions , as well as the topology of quantum control landscapes .",
    "section vi examines how the controllability of quantum systems , compared to that of classical systems , impacts control landscape properties , in particular with respect to search efficiency . in section vii and viii ,",
    "we review approaches to the quantification of quantum control search effort complexity and the design of global search algorithms that aim to attain lower bounds on complexity scaling . in section ix , we consider the effects of quantum decoherence on the structure of quantum control landscapes derived in previous sections . finally , in section x , we draw conclusions and discuss future directions .",
    "the most fundamental property of landscapes of solution sets to variational problems is their critical topology , i.e. , the number of solutions , their associated functional values , and their optimality status ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in the context of optimal control theory ,",
    "these critical points correspond to ( possibly suboptimal ) solutions of the optimal control problem , including both global and local minimizers of the objective functional .    an early work @xcite explicitly explored the multiplicity of solutions to quantum optimal control problems aimed at the maximization of the expectation value of an observable operator at a final dynamical time @xmath0 . through the application of a perturbation theory approach to the nonlinear variational equation",
    ", it was shown that in general , a denumerably infinite number of solutions ( control fields ) exist to such quantum control problems .",
    "moreover , multiple unitary propagators @xmath1 are typically associated with the various possible local and global optima of the objective",
    ". recent work , discussed throughout this review , has aimed to identify how the infinite number of solutions to quantum optimal control problems are distributed among the global and local optima of the control landscape .",
    "the optimality status of these solutions plays an important role in determining the performance of local search algorithms as they traverse the landscape .",
    "a remarkable feature of quantum optimal control landscapes is that these properties can all be determined analytically for many problems of interest , whereas for general variational problems outside of quantum control , such information is exceedingly difficult to acquire .",
    "moreover , many of these properties are independent of the hamiltonian of the quantum system .    in this section we review work aimed at characterizing the critical topologies of quantum optimal control problems . in the absence of additional information ,",
    "it is natural to expect that the control landscape will possess multiple local maxima and minima that are capable of trapping the search for optimal controls at suboptimal values of the objective .",
    "we will show that in stark contrast to this generically expected situation , the critical topologies of quantum optimal control landscapes are surprisingly simple . in what follows we consider a controllable ( see appendix [ appctrl ] for a review of the definition of controllability ) quantum system of @xmath2 discrete levels whose dynamics",
    "are driven by the hamiltonian @xmath3,$ ] depending on a free hamiltonian @xmath4 describing the uncontrolled evolution of the system and an appropriate set @xmath5 of control variables ( e.g. , phases and amplitudes in an optimal control experiment ( oce ) pulse shaper ) .    a generic quantum optimal control cost functional can be written :    @xmath6-\\\\ \\lambda\\int_{0}^t f^0(\\varepsilon(t ) ) { { \\rm d}}t\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is a lagrange multiplier operator constraining the quantum system dynamics to obey the schrdinger equation , @xmath8 is the time - dependent control field , and @xmath9 weights the importance of an auxiliary physically motivated penalty term on the field .",
    "this latter penalty decreases the degeneracy of solutions to the optimal control problem ; a common choice for @xmath10 in simulations is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the pulse envelope , corresponding to a penalty on the total field fluence .",
    "other , even more general cost functions can easily be generated with alternate choices for @xmath10 as well as additional terms involving the evolving quantum state .",
    "the two most common types of quantum optimal control problems are the maximization of the expectation value of a hermitian observable and the maximization of the fidelity of a quantum unitary transformation .",
    "optimizing the expectation value of a hermitian observable operator describes a broad variety of problems in quantum control , such as performing selective chemical fragmentation and rearrangement @xcite , redirecting energy transfer in biomolecules @xcite , creating ultra - fast optical switches and tailoring high harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "this problem corresponds to the following choice of @xmath13 : @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the initial density matrix of the system , @xmath16 is an arbitrary observable operator , and @xmath0 is the final dynamical time .    the optimal control of quantum unitary transformations has recently received increasing attention due to its applications to the field of quantum information processing ( qip ) . over the past several years , it has become clear that the physical implementation of logical gates in qip , which are represented by unitary propagators , may be facilitated by optimal control theory ( oct ) @xcite .",
    "however , as we will see below , the optimal control of unitary transformations also has applications to population transfer in atoms and molecules . within oct",

    "the variational problems of optimal control theory admit two types of minimizers . according to the chain rule",
    ", @xmath38 the first type of minimizer corresponds to those control hamiltonians that are critical points of the control objective functional , but are not critical points of the map between control fields and associated dynamical propagators ( i.e. , points at which @xmath39 , while the frechet derivative mapping from the control variation @xmath40 to @xmath41 at @xmath42 is surjective ) .",
    "the second type corresponds to critical points of the latter map ( i.e. , points at which the mapping from @xmath40 to @xmath41 is not locally surjective ) @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we consider the first type of critical point , which are referred to as kinematic critical points or normal extremal controls .",
    "the second type , which are called abnormal extremal controls , are comparatively rare in quantum control problems , and we defer their study to section vii .",
    "the class of normal extremal controls is hamiltonian - independent and captures the most universal topological features of general quantum control landscapes . because the map @xmath43 is locally surjective at these points , each of the matrix elements @xmath44 must be uniquely addressable by the control field @xmath45 for all @xmath46 and @xmath47 values in keeping with @xmath48 being unitary",
    ", i.e. , the set of @xmath49 functions @xmath50 should be linearly independent .",
    "hence , the critical condition for normal extremal controls is equivalent to @xmath51 for arbitrary @xmath52 .",

    "the critical condition is equivalent to that on the domain of unitary propagators , @xmath59 . because the gradient @xmath60 depends on the eigenvalue spectra of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , it is convenient to simplify the analysis by investigating the critical topology on the domain @xmath53 . expanding the argument of the objective function by @xmath61 where @xmath62 parametrizes an arbitrary curve in the lie algebra of @xmath53 in the direction @xmath63 ,",

    "again , all suboptimal critical points are found to be saddle manifolds , indicating that the control landscape for these infinite - dimensional quantum gates is devoid of local traps .",
    "although this landscape is devoid of traps , it can be shown @xcite that the lower symmetry of the continuous variable fidelity function , compared to that of the discrete quantum fidelity function , can result in a more rapid scaling of the number of critical manifolds .",
    "moreover , the critical topology is dependent on the target gate ( fig . [ numbers ] ) .",
    "the dynamical transformations of classical systems with quadratic hamiltonians can also be represented by symplectic propagators .",
    "however , unlike quantum observables , classical observables may be expressed as arbitrary smooth functions on phase space ( and hence the space of symplectic propagators ) ; thus , unlike quantum control landscapes , classical observable control landscapes have no universally characterizable critical topology , either for quadratic or more general classes of hamiltonians .    for each of the control landscapes discussed above ,",
    "an important issue is the size of the attracting regions of these critical manifolds and the behavior of the gradient flows of the objective function around them . unlike the critical topology , these gradient flows ( which represent a geometric property of the landscape ) are hamiltonian - dependent , and we will revisit them , including their connection to topology , in section vii .",

    "we discuss how the imposition of such constraints facilitates the identification of analytical solutions for certain ( low - dimensional ) observable and gate control problems in quantum mechanics .",
    "the previous sections showed that the critical point _",
    "topology _ of the most common quantum optimal control problems can be established analytically , and display properties favorable for optimal search . in this section ,",
    "we show that analytical statements can also be made regarding the _ geometry _ of quantum control landscapes .",
    "the geometry of a control landscape can be broken down into two components : 1 ) the relationship among controls producing the same objective function value ( level sets ) , and 2 ) the search trajectory followed in locating the optimal objective function value .",
    "the geometry of quantum control landscapes is hamiltonian - dependent .",
    "the universal monotonicity of quantum control landscapes ensures the convergence of local algorithms , but does not provide a direct measure of the search effort involved in finding optimal solutions .",
    "a further reduction in the search effort involved in locating optimal controls could be aided by analytical landscape geometry .",
    "although these analytical results may not fully identify the solution set to an optimal control problem , they may nonetheless restrict its structure .    in the case that no constraints are placed directly on the controls or on the time required for reaching the objective ,",
    "an infinite number of solutions exist to quantum control problems . as such , analytical results pertaining to the geometry of the landscape are restricted to statements regarding generic features of the controls .",
    "when constraints or auxiliary costs are imposed in the objective function , it is possible in the case of many low - dimensional problems to explicitly solve for the optimal controls . in these cases ,",
    "multiple solutions may still exist , but they are distributed among distinct unitary propagators .    studying analytical solutions to quantum control problems provides insight into the geometry of control landscapes in several ways .",
    "first , there can exist quantum symmetries that reduce the dimensionality of the domain of control fields @xmath45 over which the control search must be carried out . from",
    "either a computational or experimental perspective , this means that simpler parametrizations of the control fields can be used in optimizations , thereby reducing search effort .",
    "second , several important low - dimensional quantum optimal control problems are analytically soluble ( integrable ) once auxiliary constraints are imposed on the objective function . in particular , the problem of realizing a quantum unitary transformation in minimal time or with minimal fluence can be solved for hilbert spaces of several different dimensions . as shown in section ii , a continuous submanifold of unitary matrices is associated with the maximization of any observable expectation value .",
    "the set of points on this submanifold can be identified ( either analytically or numerically ) at minimal cost .",
    "therefore , a submanifold of the set of all solutions ( one corresponding to each unitary matrix ) to any observable control problem for such systems can be obtained through a combination of analytical and numerical methods with substantially reduced search effort , due to the existence of analytical solutions to gate control problems @xcite .",
    "this submanifold consists of all solutions that minimize the auxiliary cost ( e.g. , field fluence ) .",
    "thus , analytical solutions to gate control problems provide a means of further delineating the level set geometry of observable control landscapes .",
    "for these reasons , we review in this section analytical results pertaining to the solution of quantum control problems .",
    "we discuss 1 ) analytical results pertaining to control mechanisms in arbitrary hilbert space dimension ; 2 ) the integrability of low dimensional problems ( which in some cases relies on 1 ) , and 3 ) the reasons that integrability breaks down in higher dimensions , whereas mechanistic simplicity is retained .",
    "the basic theorem of optimal control theory used for solving problems of this type is the pontryagin maximum principle , reviewed in appendix [ max ] .",
    "consider the control problem of minimizing a cost associated with steering the system    @xmath124    from some initial state @xmath125 to some final state @xmath126 . for quantum gate and state control",
    ", we are dealing with the right - invariant control systems @xmath127u$ ] and @xmath128\\psi$ ] , respectively ( see appendix [ appctrl ] for a definition of right - invariance ) .",
    "note that these equations can be generalized to the case of @xmath112-independent controls , which could take the form of , e.g. , components of the time - dependent electromagnetic field coupled to independent pauli spin operators in an nmr control experiment .",
    "when analytically solving for optimal controls satisfying pontryagin s maximum principle ( pmp ) , the maximization of the function @xmath13 in equation ( [ oct ] ) is often imposed as a fixed constraint in addition to the schrodinger equation , and the `` cost '' to be minimized takes the form of the last term in this equation .",
    "such problems are framed most conveniently in hamiltonian form .",

    "the fluence of the control fields were constrained considerably , corresponding to large values of @xmath9 in equation ( [ oct ] ) .",
    "although the sampling was not exhaustive enough to rigorously establish level set structure or landscape topology , the results suggested that local maxima existed in the @xmath283 fragmentation landscape for the parameterizations employed .",

    "the maxima and minima of the landscape were identified , with clear level sets , and no evidence for local traps was found .    in most cases of practical interest in the weak - field regime ,",
    "unconstrained quantum control landscapes possess no suboptimal traps .",
    "thus , local experimental search algorithms should be effective in locating optimal controls ; moreover , since gradient - based algorithms can take advantage of landscape structure , they may perform better than `` blind '' algorithms ( e.g. genetic algorithms ) under suitable conditions . in the aforementioned work of roslund and rabitz ,",

    "quantitative assessment of the statistical uncertainties associated with these estimates , as a function of the number of measurements made , is essential for determining the speedup that can be achieved by using gradient versus adaptive search algorithms .    following the gradient flow of the objective function exploits the favorable topology of quantum control landscapes , but",
    "does not explicitly exploit their geometry .",
    "in particular , the best path to the global maximum in fig . [",
    "filtered ] is not necessarily the gradient flow path .",
    "a further possibility is to use local algorithms that make use of local gradient information , but do not follow the gradient flow directly , instead tracking alternative observable expectation value paths . in this regard , an important question is whether certain observable paths are expected to display more rapid convergence to the global optimum than others .",
    "section [ search ] discusses how geometric features of quantum control landscapes indicate that certain observable paths may in fact be globally more efficient than the gradient flow . because they do not follow the path of steepest ascent",
    ", these algorithms may require more accurate estimation of the gradient .",
    "such methodologies could also be applied to explicit experimental tracking of predetermined level set trajectories @xcite .        in summary ,",
    "improved methods for the measurement of the gradient in the presence of noise , and the accessibility of control field parameterizations capable of tracking the gradient are the central challenges for implementing experimental control algorithms that exploit the favorable topological and geometric structure of quantum control landscapes .",
