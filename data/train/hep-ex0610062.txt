    "this measurement is the first step towards a high - statistics dalitz - plot analysis of the @xmath1 decay .",
    "the latter could give insight into the controversy on the s - wave @xmath5 contribution in these decays @xcite , as well as a sensitive study of the @xmath6 violation in the neutral d meson system .",
    "knowledge of @xmath0(@xmath7)/@xmath0(@xmath8 ) ( also based on the @xmath1 dalitz analysis ) could improve our understanding of the apparent discrepancy of the measured two - body branching fractions ( @xmath9 kk , @xmath10 ) with the theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the value of @xmath0(@xmath1 ) as reported in pdg04 @xcite is poor .",
    "using a large data sample of @xmath11 decays accumulated with the belle detector , we provide a significantly improved measurement using the @xmath2 decay mode for normalization . since both decay modes involve a neutral pion and the same number of charged tracks in the final state , several sources of the systematic uncertainties are avoided in a determination of the relative branching fraction .",
    "the obtained result can then be compared to recent measurements by the cleo @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations . a detailed study of the @xmath1 decay as well as of other @xmath11 @xmath6-symmetric final states , can be used to further improve statistics for the measurement of the angle @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the ckm - matrix .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer located at the kekb @xmath4 storage rings , which collide 8.0 gev electrons with 3.5 gev positrons and produce @xmath14(4s ) at the energy of 10.58 gev .",
    "closest to the interaction point is a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , surrounded by a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight ( tof ) scintillation counters , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi ( tl ) crystals .",
    "these subdetectors are located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return yoke located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath15 mesons and identify muons . the detector is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for this analysis , we used a data sample of 357 fb@xmath3 accumulated with the belle detector .",
    "@xmath11 candidates are selected from @xmath16 decays where the charge of the @xmath17 tags the @xmath11 flavour : @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 s originate mainly from continuum .",
    "although we do not apply any topological cuts , the yield of @xmath19 s from @xmath20-meson decays is negligible ; such events are rejected by other kinematical cuts such as the strong @xmath21(@xmath19 ) requirement .",
    "@xmath11 mesons are reconstructed from combinations of two oppositely charged pions ( or a charged pion and kaon in the case of @xmath22 ) and one neutral pion .",
    "the latter is reconstructed from two @xmath13 candidates satisfying the @xmath23 mass requirement given below .",
    "+ the following kinematic criteria are applied to the charged track candidates : the distance from the nominal interaction point to the point of closest approach of the track is required to be within 0.15 cm in the radial direction ( @xmath24 ) and 0.3 cm along the beam direction ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we also require the transverse momentum of the track @xmath26 @xmath27 0.050 gev / c to suppress beam background .",
    "kaons and pions are separated by combining the responses of the acc and the tof with the @xmath28 measurement from the cdc to form a likelihood @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a pion or a kaon .",
    "charged particles are identified as pions or kaons using the likelihood ratio @xmath31 . for charged pion identification , we require @xmath32 .",
    "this requirement selects pions with an efficiency of 93% and misidentified kaons with an efficiency of 9% . for the identification of charged kaons ,",
    "the requirement is @xmath33 ; in this case , the efficiency for kaon identification is 86% and the probability to misidentify a pion is 4% .",
    "+ we impose conditions on the energies of the photons constituting the @xmath23 candidate ( @xmath34 @xmath27 0.060 gev ) , the two - photon invariant mass ( @xmath35 gev / c@xmath36 gev / c@xmath37 ) and the @xmath23 s momentum in the laboratory frame ( @xmath38(@xmath23 ) @xmath27 0.3 gev / c ) to suppress combinatorial @xmath23 s .",
    "+ the mass difference of @xmath19 and @xmath11 candidates should satisfy the restrictions : @xmath39 gev / c@xmath40 gev / c@xmath37 and @xmath41 gev / c@xmath42 gev / c@xmath37 . the momentum of the @xmath19 in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath43 must lie in the range : @xmath44 gev / c@xmath45 gev / c .",
    "the lower cut is applied to suppress slow fake @xmath19 s reconstructed from combinatorial background that originates from @xmath20 decays .",
    "the upper cut restricts @xmath46 to the region where the monte carlo ( mc ) distribution is in good agreement with the data ( see fig",
    ". 1 , left ) . to eliminate background from the @xmath47 decays ,",
    "the following veto on @xmath48 is applied : @xmath49 gev@xmath37/c@xmath50 gev@xmath37/c@xmath51 .",
    "to obtain detection efficiencies , about 1.2@xmath52 phase - space distributed mc events have been generated for each of the two modes , processed using the geant  based detector simulation @xcite and reconstructed with the same selection criteria as the data .",
    "+ to obtain a more realistic @xmath11 decay model than a uniform dalitz - plot distribution , the events of both signal mc samples have been weighted using matrix elements based on decay models obtained by cleo  @xcite in the framework of a 3-resonance model ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and a nonresonant contribution ) for @xmath1 and in the framework of a 7-resonance model ( @xmath53 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and a nonresonant contribution ) for the case of @xmath2 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "+    the obtained yield is normalized to the same mc data but before detector simulation and before application of selection criteria . since for the relative branching fraction measurement only the ratio of @xmath62 and @xmath22 efficiencies is needed , we only generate events in the @xmath63 range from 3.5 to 4.3 gev / c where mc is in good agreement with the data ( see fig . 1 , left ) .",
    "the obtained efficiencies are : @xmath64 @xmath65",
    "to describe the background shape in the @xmath66 signal region , a sample of generic mc , equivalent to @xmath67250 fb@xmath3 , has been processed with the same selection criteria as data .",
    "the contributions of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 backgrounds have been summed up . for the @xmath71 sample signal events",
    "were excluded .",
    "figure 3 shows the individual contributions to the @xmath66 distribution where also a partial data sample , corresponding to the luminosity of mc , is shown .",
    "the @xmath66 background distribution is fitted with a @xmath73 order polynomial multiplied by an error function ( kaon misidentification region ) plus a @xmath74 order polynomial ( combinatoric background ) and a small gaussian peak in the signal region ( see fig .",
    "3 , right ) .",
    "the gaussian contribution is mainly due to combinations of a correctly reconstructed @xmath11 and a random @xmath17 candidate .",
    "+    most of the background is from e@xmath75e@xmath76 @xmath71 ; the @xmath72 background is negligible and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 backgrounds are linearly distributed in the @xmath66 signal region . among the @xmath71 background sources",
    "@xmath77 is dominant : charged kaons are misidentified as pions and @xmath78 is typically shifted downwards by @xmath79 gev / c@xmath37 thus being well separated from the signal .",
    "+ the background shape in the @xmath80 distribution is obtained using a generic mc sample .",
    "the level of background in this mode is low but still has a nontrivial structure ( see fig .",
    "4 , right ) .",
    "the distribution has three distinctive peaks : the rightmost one is due to misidentified pions from @xmath1 , the central one has the same origin as the one in the @xmath81 case ( random @xmath17 ) , the leftmost feature originates mainly from @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "the distribution is fitted by the sum of a @xmath73 order polynomial and a @xmath73 order polynomial multiplied by an error function ( left peak ) and two gaussians .",
    "the shape of the signal peak in the experimental @xmath62 invariant mass distribution ( see fig . 5 , left ) is partially fixed to the mc one @xcite : the latter was fitted with a bifurcated hyperbolic gaussian @xcite and a regular gaussian ( see fig .",
    "1 , right ) . the obtained shape with floating normalization and @xmath84 s , together with the background shape with its floating normalization ( i.e. 5 free parameters ) is then used as the fit function for the measured @xmath66 distribution . +    to fit the experimental @xmath85 invariant mass distribution we use a @xmath85 background shape with floating normalization and the sum of two bifurcated and a regular gaussian for the signal peak ( see fig .",
    "4 , right ) . here , the parameters of the signal peak are free in the fit since the level of background is low and statistics are large enough . +    the yields of signal events in each channel , as obtained from the fit , are given in table [ t7 ] :    [ t7 ]    .number of signal events and efficiencies [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    finally , we can compare our measurement of the ratio with the ratio obtained from the latest world average values of @xmath86 and @xmath0(@xmath87 ) @xcite .",
    "our result ( 9.71 @xmath88 0.31)% is consistent with the world average one ( 9.29 @xmath88 0.54)% and has better accuracy . by choosing the normalization mode",
    "@xmath2 we avoid many sources of systematic uncertainty including the @xmath23 detection efficiency and uncertainty in the tracking efficiency .",
    "the pid efficiency partially cancels out .",
    "using 357 fb@xmath3 of data collected with the belle detector , the first direct measurement of the relative branching fraction @xmath0(@xmath1)/ @xmath0(@xmath2 ) has been performed .",
    "our preliminary result @xmath89 is compatible with the world average @xmath90 and is more precise .",
    "the belle result differs by @xmath91 from the value recently obtained by babar @xcite : @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding value of the absolute branching fraction @xmath0(@xmath1 ) is ( 13.69 @xmath88 0.66)@xmath93 .",
