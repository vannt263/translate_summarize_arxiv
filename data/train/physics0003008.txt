    "special relativity , as presented in today s textbooks , is a complex mathematical theory .",
    "the 1 spatial + 1 temporal dimensional minkowski diagrams , which initially introduce the lorentz transformation , the time dilatation and the length contraction , are soon put aside in favor of an approach based on differential calculus and linear algebra .",
    "one gets little intuitive understanding of the law of relativistic addition of velocities , and of the fact that `` magnetism is a kind of second - order effect arising from relativistic changes in the electric fields of moving charges '' @xcite .",
    "however , by introducing only slightly more elaborate minkowski diagrams , and using geometrical derivations , one can get back the intuitive understanding , to the great delight of the physicist who still believes in the spirit of descartes philosophy .",
    "the complex plane , like the real plane , is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) vector space .",
    "the scalar products for the real plane ( 1 ) and for the complex plane ( 2 ) are defined as follows @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2,@xmath3 and respectively @xmath2,@xmath4 are the basis vectors .",
    "since both planes have a scalar product , one can talk about orthogonal vectors ( their scalar product is zero ) and about the magnitude of a vector ( the square root of the scalar product of a vector with itself ) .",
    "this allows us to define the circle ( the geometric locus of the points equally spaced from a given point ) , the angle in radians ( the length , between two points of a circle of radius one , measured along the circumference ) , and the trigonometric functions sine and cosine ( the magnitudes of the projections of a radius one vector on the two coordinate axes ) . from these definitions it follows that , for both the real and the complex planes , one has the relations : @xmath5 @xmath6 ^ 2 + [ { d \\over d\\alpha } \\cos(\\alpha ) ] ^2 = 1.\\ ] ] from ( 3)-(4 ) one can get the derivatives of the trigonometric functions , the taylor series expansions of sine and cosine , and then all the well known trigonometric relations .",
    "the only detail we have to keep in mind is that the angle @xmath7 in the real plane is a real number , while in the complex plane it is a purely imaginary number , due to the non - positive definite scalar product used in the last case .",
    "there are a few more relevant differences , which we can best point out if we represent the complex plane as an euclidean plane .",
    "two vectors in the complex plane are orthogonal if they make the same angle with the bisecting line of the first quadrant .",
    "the circle in the complex plane looks like a hyperbola @xcite .",
    "not any line passing through the origin intersects the right ( or left ) branch of the hyperbola .",
    "this means that there are pairs of lines passing through the origin to which we can not assign an angle .",
    "however , for the triangles we will be working with , the ratio of segments behaves as if it were an angle , of negative value .",
    "the true angle is obtained by symmetry with respect to the first bisecting line , as the pair @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicates in figure  [ velocity ] .",
    "consider a reference frame k which is moving with a velocity @xmath9 relative to another one k , and a particle moving with a velocity @xmath10 in the reference frame k. the reference frames are chosen such that their origins and the particle coincide at the space - time point o , as shown in figure  [ velocity ] .",
    "notice that @xmath11 and @xmath12 , because @xmath13 has a component only in the x direction .",
    "the oz axis is not plotted , but is similar to the oy axis .",
    "the question is : what is the velocity @xmath14 of the particle in the reference frame k ?",
    "the world - line op of the particle is projected on the complex planes ( x , o , ict ) , ( y , o , ict ) , ( z , o , ict ) , ( x,o , ict ) , ( y,o , ict ) , ( z,o , ict ) , and the resulting angles from the respective projections give the components of the velocity of the particle in the two reference frames considered .",
    "for the situation considered the planes ( x , o , ict ) and ( x,o , ict ) coincide .",
    "it is seen from figure  [ velocity ] that @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 in order to express @xmath20 and @xmath21 as functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 we need to express @xmath24 and @xmath25 as functions of @xmath7,@xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in the plane ( x , o , ict ) of the lorentz",
    "boost the addition of velocities is based on the addition of angles @xcite @xmath28 @xmath29 from ( 11 ) , by substitution of the tangents ( 5)-(9 ) , it follows that @xmath30 two rectangles , apcd and bpce , result from the projection process .",
    "it is evident that @xmath31 @xmath32 from ( 13)-(14 ) it follows that @xmath33}.\\ ] ] by substitutions of the tangents ( 5)-(8 ) and of @xmath34^{-1/2}$ ] we get @xmath35 a similar expression is obtained for the @xmath36 component .",
    "consider two charged particles ( with charges @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) at some arbitrary positions , moving with arbitrary , but uniform , velocities .",
    "we orient our 3d reference frame in such a way that the first particle ( which generates the field ) is initially at the origin , moving along the ox axis with velocity @xmath9 , and the vector @xmath39 connecting the two particles is in the ( x , o , y ) plane .",
    "the angle between @xmath40 and the ox axis is @xmath25 .",
    "the second particle ( subject to the electromagnetic field generated by the first one ) is moving with velocity @xmath14 .",
    "a section through the ( x , o , y ) plane can be seen in figure  [ eminter ] .",
    "the first particle is at point o and the second one is at point a.      the electric field ( in gaussian units ) generated by the first particle at the position of the second particle is @xcite @xmath41^{-3/2}.\\ ] ] the magnetic field generated by the first particle is @xmath42 the lorentz force acting on the second particle is @xmath43 from ( 17)-(19 ) the cartesian components of the force @xcite are obtained @xmath44^{-3/2 }   [ \\cos ( \\theta ) + \\sin ( \\theta ) { v_y v \\over c^2}]\\ ] ] @xmath45^{-3/2 }   \\sin ( \\theta ) ( 1 - { v_x v \\over c^2})\\ ] ] @xmath46      the force components ( 20)-(22 ) can be obtained in a more graphical way , if we start with the coulomb force generated by a charged particle at rest . one key assumption or experimental fact",
    "is that in a frame where all the source charges producing an electric field @xmath47 are at rest , the force on a charge @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 independent of the velocity of the charge in that frame @xcite .",
    "the reference frame k in which the source particle is at rest is moving with velocity @xmath13 relative to the original frame k.    in the reference frame k the particle at a is observed to interact with the particle at o. the distance between particles is @xmath50 , the length of the segment @xmath51 .    in the reference frame k the particle at a is observed to interact with the particle at b , where the segment @xmath52 is a position vector @xmath53 parallel to the plane ( x,o , y ) .",
    "the following construction gives the position of point b : the segment @xmath54 is parallel to oy and intersects the ox axis at e , whereas the segment @xmath55 is parallel to ox and intersects the world - line @xmath56 at b. @xmath57 projects the point b on the ox axis at d.    relative to k , the particle at b exerts a radial coulomb force on the particle at a. this force ( in gaussian units ) is @xmath58 where @xmath59 $ ] .    the key point in getting the force @xmath60 in the reference frame k is to notice that the force , in any reference frame considered , is given by the projection on the real 3d space of that frame of the 4-force @xmath61 ( which is a minkowski - space vector ) , that is @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we will obtain the 4-force @xmath61 from its real and imaginary components ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) in the reference frame k , then we will decompose the same 4-force into its real and imaginary components ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) in the reference frame k. the lorentz force we are looking for is just @xmath70 .    from ( 23)-(25 ) it follows that @xmath71 to get the imaginary component @xmath67 we use the orthogonality between the 4-force and the 4-velocity , @xmath72 , where the 4-velocity is @xmath73 .",
    "the orthogonality condition leads to @xmath74 @xmath75 where the radial component of the velocity is @xmath76 the components of the force @xmath60 in the reference frame k are given by the projection of the 4-force @xmath61 on the 3d real space of k. an easy way to do this is to notice that we can decompose @xmath66 ( which has the direction of the segment @xmath52 ) and @xmath67 ( which has the direction of the segment @xmath77 ) into sums of 4-vectors , each of the 4-vectors being parallel to one of the axes of the reference frame k : @xmath78 @xmath79 because these expansions do not involve any component along the oz axis , this simply means that @xmath80 .",
    "the projections of the 4-force on the ox and oy axes are @xmath81 @xmath82 the lengths of the various segments needed above are as follows : @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88^{1/2 } = r'\\ ] ] we also notice that @xmath89 .",
