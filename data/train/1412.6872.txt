    "<S> the 2-flavor polyakov - loop extended model is generalized by taking into account the effective four - quark vector - type interaction with the coupling strengths , which are endowed with a dependence on the polyakov field @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective vertex generates entanglement interaction between the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the influence of an additional quark vector interaction and the entanglement interaction on the location of the critical end - point at the given chemical potential or quark density . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the finite value of the vector interaction strength @xmath1 improves the model agreement with the lattice data . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the non - zero @xmath1 and entanglement on the thermodynamic observables and the curvature of the crossover boundary in the @xmath2 plane is also examined . </S>"
