    "we remind the reader that we consider the poincar s disc model of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we denote by  @xmath6 the once and for all fixed disc of the euclidean plane which is the support of poincar s model .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the circle which is the border of  @xmath6 .",
    "we remind the reader that the points of  @xmath7 are called * points at infinity * and that they do not belong to the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the figures of the paper will take place in this frame . in our sequel , otherwise not mentioned , _ line _ means a line of the hyperbolic plane , most often an arc of a circle in the model .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite , for instance , where other references are mentioned .    in this paper , we give a different proof from what was outlined in  @xcite although it is based on the same construction .",
    "fix two orthogonal diameters of  @xmath6 .",
    "one is called * horizontal * and the other one * vertical*. in order to define the infinigons , we consider the following sequence @xmath8 . given two points @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 and the angle @xmath10,\\pi[$ ] , we first construct the line @xmath12 which passes through  @xmath10 and which makes an angle of @xmath13 with the line @xmath14 . define @xmath15 to be the image of  @xmath16 by reflection in  @xmath17 .",
    "we repeat the process indefinitely , starting from  , where o is the centre of  @xmath6 , and from  @xmath18 for the points with positive indices and starting from  @xmath18 and  @xmath19 for the points with negative indices .",
    "( margenstern , see  @xcite)[const1 ] for all @xmath0 and @xmath20 , the points @xmath16 which are obtained by the construction above belong to a euclidean circle , call it  @xmath21 whose diameter is @xmath22 . moreover , the curvilinear abscissa of the @xmath16 s on @xmath21 starting from @xmath19 toward @xmath18 are increasing .",
    "@xmath21 is strictly inside  @xmath6 , is a horocycle or an equidistant curve if and only if @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 respectively .",
    "if @xmath21 is a horocycle , the @xmath16 s converge to its unique point at infinity .",
    "if @xmath21 is an equidistant curve , the @xmath16 s for positive  @xmath26 converge to one point at infinity of  @xmath21 while the @xmath16 s for negative  @xmath26 converge to the other point at infinity .    the proof is illustrated by figure  [ construc ] .",
    "let @xmath27 be the hyperbolic bisector of the segment @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "then let @xmath29 be the hyperbolic line passing through  @xmath18 which makes an angle of @xmath30 with the line which supports @xmath31 .",
    "note that we may consider that the first two points are on a diameter of  @xmath6 with @xmath19 at the centre of  @xmath6 . depending on the possible intersection of  @xmath27 with  @xmath29",
    ", we have three cases : either @xmath27 and  @xmath29 meet inside  @xmath6 , or they meet on  @xmath7 or they do not meet at all .",
    "first case : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a point of the hyperbolic plane , so that it is inside  @xmath6 , not on  @xmath7 .",
    "then , the triangle @xmath34 is isosceles with  @xmath31 as its basis .",
    "the reflection of the triangle in  @xmath29 defines a new triangle  @xmath35 and , from the reflection , the bisector  @xmath36 of  @xmath37 passes through  @xmath33 and the image  @xmath38 of  @xmath39 is the line  @xmath38 which passes through  @xmath40 and which makes an angle of  @xmath30 with the hyperbolic line  @xmath37 : in particular , @xmath29 appears to be the bisector of the angle @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to see that repeating with  @xmath38 and the triangle  @xmath35 what was performed with  @xmath29 and the triangle  @xmath34 , we get a sequence  @xmath16 where the bisector  @xmath12 of the angle @xmath42 and the bisector  @xmath43 of the segment @xmath44 $ ] meet all at the point  @xmath33 . from this , we conclude that all the @xmath16 s belong to a circle  @xmath21 which , in the poincar s disc model is a euclidean circle inside  @xmath6 with no intersection with  @xmath7 .",
    "second case : @xmath45  * p * , where * p * is on @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the lines @xmath27 and  @xmath29 are parallel .",
    "the triangle @xmath31*p * is not an ordinary triangle , but what we call an * ideal * triangle as it has one vertex on  @xmath7 .",
    "it is also an isosceles triangle as by parallelism : this comes from the fact that @xmath27 is the bisector of  @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "as the reflection in a line keeps the angles , keeps the distance and as the images of parallel lines are also parallel lines under a reflection in a line , we can repeat the argument for the first case and conclude that all bisectors  @xmath17 and  @xmath46 constructed with the sequence of the  @xmath16 s meet at  * p*. accordingly , the  @xmath16 s are all on a horocycle  @xmath21 which , in the poincar s disc model appears as a euclidean circle which is tangent to  @xmath7 at  * p*.    third case : @xmath47 .",
    "this time the line  @xmath27 and  @xmath29 have a unique common perpendicular  @xmath48 .",
    "consider the orthogonal projections @xmath49 and  @xmath50 of @xmath19 and  @xmath18 respectively on  @xmath48 . by the reflection in  @xmath27",
    ", @xmath51 is a saccheri quadrangle .",
    "now , @xmath52 so that the reflection in  @xmath29 which keeps  @xmath48 globally invariant provides us with a new saccheri quadrangle @xmath53 . in this new setting , it clearly appears that @xmath54 is the bisector of the angle @xmath41 . repeating the process",
    ", we have two sequences , the @xmath16 s and the @xmath55 s , their orthogonal projection on  @xmath48 .",
    "we can see that the bisectors of the segments @xmath14 and the bisectors of the angles @xmath42 are all perpendicular to  @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath56 is a saccheri quadrangle , it is clear that all lengths @xmath57 are equal so that the @xmath16 s lie on an equidistant line  @xmath21 which is an euclidean circle in the poincar s disc model and this time , @xmath21 precisely has two points of intersection with @xmath7 .",
    "denote by @xmath58 the length of @xmath59 , in the hyperbolic plane , taken on  @xmath21 . in the last two cases , . in the first case ,",
    "if @xmath60 is the circumference of  @xmath21 , we have that .",
    "we can characterize the condition on the euclidean length  @xmath31 , when @xmath61 , for which @xmath21 is either a circle , a horocycle or an equidistant curve .    as we assume that @xmath61 , it is not difficult to see that @xmath31 is supported by a diameter of  @xmath6 and that the hyperbolic line passing through  @xmath19 and making an angle of @xmath30 with @xmath31 is also a diameter of  @xmath6 .",
    "accordingly , the euclidean diameter of  @xmath21 is @xmath62 .",
    "now , it is clear that @xmath21 intersects @xmath7 if and only if @xmath63 .    in the case of a horocycle , as for all  @xmath26",
    ", the sequence can not converge to a point which would be strictly inside  @xmath6 . as and as the @xmath16 s have an accumulation point in the closure of  @xmath6 which is compact , the @xmath16 s converge to the unique point at infinity of  @xmath21 .",
    "the same argument shows the conclusion of the theorem when @xmath21 is an equidistant curve .    in the case when @xmath24 , the convex hull of the @xmath16 s , completed by the reflection in one of the @xmath17 s is called an * infinigon*. it is not difficult to see that an infinigon does not occupy all the hyperbolic plane and that it tiles the plane if and only if @xmath64 for some @xmath3 with @xmath65 .",
    "however , there is another construction of the infinigons which will be of help for us .",
    "it was also indicated in  @xcite .",
    "it consists in considering a regular convex polygon  @xmath66 with @xmath67 as interior angle , by placing a vertex  @xmath68 at  o , the centre of  @xmath6 , and one side abutting at  @xmath68 on a diameter of  @xmath6 , and the other side on a diameter which is orthogonal to the previous one .",
    "next , with these conditions being fixed , we make the number of sides of  @xmath66 to grow . what happens ?",
    "it happens the length of the side of  @xmath66 increases , but it reaches a limit , namely @xmath69 in this example . and so , the limit of the polygons is an infinigon as we have indicated .",
    "this can be generalized as follows :    [ const2 ] let @xmath70 denote the regular convex polygon such that one of its vertex is  o. let @xmath71 be the circumscribed circle of  @xmath70 .",
    "we may assume that the tangent at  o to  @xmath71 is horizontal .",
    "let @xmath72 be the euclidean distance of the hyperbolic centre of  @xmath71 to  o and let @xmath73 be the euclidean distance of the euclidean centre of  @xmath71 to  o. then , and : we have that for any  @xmath74 , @xmath75 as @xmath76 and @xmath77 as @xmath76 .",
    "# 1215=    let us consider this situation .",
    "let @xmath70 be the regular convex polygon with @xmath78 sides and an interior angle  @xmath79 so that @xmath74  copies of @xmath70 can be put around a point  @xmath33 to cover a neighbourhood of  @xmath33 with no overlap .",
    "as previously , we can put one vertex of the polygon at  o and then , we proceed as in the proof of the theorem .",
    "as we know , the @xmath16 s are on a circle  @xmath71 . in  @xcite , we give the computation of the radius of  @xmath71 . here",
    "we give a somewhat simplified version of this computation .",
    "the vertices of  @xmath70 can be written as @xmath80 which we rewrite @xmath81 as @xmath78 and  @xmath74 are fixed in this part of the proof .",
    "we define @xmath82 by @xmath83 with @xmath84@xmath85@xmath86 $ ] .",
    "define @xmath87 the vertex defined by @xmath3 and consider @xmath88 .",
    "the euclidean support  @xmath89 of the segment @xmath90 is the circle whose equation is , where @xmath91 is the centre  @xmath92 of  @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the coordinates of  @xmath88 .",
    "we write that the tangent of  @xmath89 at  @xmath88 makes the angle @xmath94 with @xmath95 . as @xmath96",
    "has coordinates @xmath97 , we can take @xmath98 with coordinates @xmath99 for the tangent . as , this equality gives us : .",
    "as @xmath100 , we divide this by  @xmath49 giving us : in @xmath101 , we can see that and from the equation of  @xmath89 which passes through  @xmath88 , we get that , so that squaring  @xmath101 and putting in it the just obtained equalities we obtain after easy simplifications : now , we rewrite the fact that @xmath89 passes through  @xmath88 by , solving this equation in  @xmath102 and taking into account that should be satisfied , we get : from  @xmath103 we easily get that , where @xmath104 and .",
    "factorizing @xmath105 in @xmath106 and then @xmath107 we get that which allows us to easily deduce  @xmath108 .    in order to get the distance from the euclidean centre of  @xmath71 to  o , let @xmath109 in order to simplify the notations and let @xmath110 be the euclidean length of the diameter of  @xmath71 .",
    "of course , the required distance is @xmath111 , so that we have to compute  @xmath110 .",
    "now , let @xmath112 be the point at distance  @xmath110 from  o on a diameter of  @xmath6 which also passes through the centre of  @xmath71 and let @xmath113 denote the hyperbolic centre of  @xmath71 .",
    "we know that @xmath113 is the hyperbolic mid - point of o@xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the circle which passes through  @xmath113 , centred on the line o@xmath112 and which is orthogonal to  @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath91 be the coordinates of  @xmath89 as o@xmath112 can be taken as the @xmath20-axis .",
    "we have : the first equation says that @xmath113 is the mid - point of o@xmath112 .",
    "the second one says that @xmath89 passes through  @xmath113 .",
    "cancelling @xmath114 in the first equation and subtracting with the second one we get that . putting that in the second equation we get",
    "from which we derive @xmath115 . using @xmath108 in this latter expression",
    ", we get @xmath116 after straightforward computations .",
    "the conclusion of the theorem on the limits of @xmath72 and @xmath73 are straightforward .",
    "we can see that the conclusion of theorem  [ const2 ] confirms the statement of theorem  [ const1 ] .",
    "what can be said about these construction in the light of the new numeral system introduced by yaroslav sergeyev , see  @xcite ? here , we mainly look at the case when @xmath24 and when for some positive integer  @xmath74 .",
    "let us consider the construction involved in theorem  [ const1 ] .",
    "we can see that we must replace the vague notion of @xmath117 with the more precise indication on the infinite number of @xmath16 s we consider .",
    "the conclusion we must reach is that if @xmath118 is a positive infinite integer , @xmath119 never reaches * p*. indeed , by construction , @xmath119 is in the hyperbolic plane , _",
    "i.e. _ inside  @xmath6 , so that if @xmath120 can be defined , @xmath120 is also in the hyperbolic plane and it can not be  * p*. however , * p * itself can be defined , at least as the intersection of  @xmath29 and  @xmath27 at infinity or , which is equivalent , by saying that @xmath29 and  @xmath27 are parallel .",
    "accordingly , we can say that in some sense , the infinigon can also be defined , but it is an * ideal * object in this sense that it is essentially incomplete : we can not tell the number of its sides .",
    "if we look at the construction which is considered in theorem  [ const2 ] , we have a completely different landscape .",
    "this time , if @xmath118 is a positive infinite integer , we can define a regular convex polygon  @xmath66 with @xmath118  sides .",
    "the computations performed in section  [ clas_infig ] for theorem  [ const2 ] gives us a precise description of this object .",
    "consider that @xmath74  is fixed , where @xmath74  is a positive finite integer .",
    "then the vertices of  @xmath66 are on a circle  @xmath21 of the hyperbolic plane which is not a horocycle : this circle is completely in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "however , its diameter is infinite as its representation in the hyperbolic plane is infinitesimally close to  1 . replacing  @xmath78 by  @xmath118 in  @xmath116",
    ", we can see that the diameter of  @xmath21 is .",
    "let us put and @xmath121 .",
    ". is it true that @xmath122 ? indeed , @xmath122 if and only if if and only if which is equivalent to .",
    "it remains to see that .",
    "indeed :        the just provided computation can be made more precise : we know that so that from  @xmath123 as @xmath124 , we can see that .",
    "when @xmath118 is an infinite positive integer , the order of is and that of @xmath125 is , so that . this inequality proves that @xmath21 is still in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "call * infinigon * this polygon with infinitely many sides , exactly with @xmath118  of them .",
    "it is plain that such an infinigon tiles the hyperbolic plane .",
    "in fact , from  @xmath108 and from the fact that the hyperbolic distance  @xmath126 corresponding to the euclidean distance  @xmath127 from  o to  @xmath112 is given by lobachevsky s formula : . we obtain in this way that @xmath128 so that in the end @xmath129 . now , : which is equal to @xmath130 , where @xmath33 is a function of  @xmath74 and  @xmath118 bounded by a finite positive number .",
    "on another hand , now , @xmath131 , as @xmath132 differs from @xmath133 by a higher order infinitesimal . taking this into account , the previous computation can be continued as follows :        now , from  @xmath108 and  @xmath116 we have something more : if we replace  @xmath74 by a positive infinite integer  @xmath137 , the formulas are still valid as well as the computation leading to formula  @xmath123 . in this case",
    "we can replace the estimation given in  @xmath138 by the following one :    again we call * infinigon * the polygon obtained in this case as its diameter is actually infinite and as the number of its sides is also defined by an infinite integer . however , in order to distinguish between these two kinds of infinigons , call * infinigon of first order * , for short * first order infinigon * , those defined by @xmath139 where @xmath118 is a positive infinite integer and @xmath74  a positive finite integer with @xmath140 .",
    "we call * infinigon of second order * , for short * second order infinigon * , those defined by @xmath141 where @xmath118 and  @xmath142 are both positive infinite integers .",
    "it is plain that both @xmath139 and @xmath141 tile the plane by the standard process : we take @xmath143 a copy of  @xmath139 and then we replicate it by reflection in its sides and , recursively , by reflections of the images in their sides . the same process can be applied to copies of  @xmath141 where both @xmath137 and  @xmath118 are infinite numbers .",
    "when we say that the infinigons of first order tile the plane by the above process , we say _",
    "recursively _ which is in fact a vague term . in the traditional meaning",
    ", this means _",
    "endlessly_. as there is no more precise notion than the cardinals for estimating infinite numbers in traditional mathematics , here we have to make things more clear .",
    "when we say _",
    "recursively _ we have to mention to which depth we go on the recursive process .",
    "controlling recursion up to a fixed depth in advance is a standard feature in the implementation of certain programming languages .",
    "this does not prevent more theoretic oriented languages to allow depths which are only limited by the resources of the machine on which the program runs .",
    "here , we adopt the same spirit : when we use the word _ recursively _ , it is possible to not indicate to which depth , but for a precise study of the process , it is better to indicate to which depth we allow to proceed .",
    "let  @xmath144 be the depth of recursion .",
    "it is plain that from this definition , after a few steps of iteration of the process , we may obtain a copy which overlaps an already existing copy .",
    "of course , a copy is considered to be reached by the @xmath145 recursive call if it has not been produced by a previous call .    a way to detect the set of copies obtained up to the depth",
    "@xmath26 has been indicated in  @xcite .",
    "it consists in building a tree which is in bijection with the tiling .",
    "however , as  @xcite was written with a more traditional look at infinity , we have to revisit this construction .",
    "say that the centre of an infinigon is the centre of its circumscribing circle .",
    "we fix two contiguous sides of  @xmath143 , a fixed copy of  @xmath139 , say @xmath146 and  @xmath147 and let  @xmath148 be their common vertex .",
    "we have two cases depending on whether @xmath74  is odd or even .",
    "first assume that @xmath74  is even , say @xmath149 .",
    "this is the easy case .",
    "consider the ray  @xmath150 which is issued from  @xmath148 and which supports  @xmath146 .",
    "we may consider that @xmath146 lies on the left hand side of  @xmath148 .",
    "let  @xmath151 be the other end of  @xmath146 . from  @xmath151 , out of  @xmath146",
    ", @xmath150 is the support of a side shared by two copies of  @xmath143 which share  @xmath151 with  @xmath143 .",
    "it is plain that this process can be continued .",
    "the same can be performed with  @xmath152 , the ray issued from  @xmath148 which supports  @xmath147 .",
    "let  @xmath153 be the angular sector defined by the angle @xmath154 .",
    "we construct a tree whose root is attached to  @xmath143 .",
    "each node of the tree is attached to a copy of  @xmath143 inside  @xmath153 .",
    "a node  @xmath144 of the tree is the son of a node  @xmath48 only if the copy attached to  @xmath144 and that attached to  @xmath48 share a common side . to precisely define the notion of childhood , we start from the root . by definition ,",
    "its sons are the reflections of  @xmath143 in its sides which are still inside  @xmath153 .",
    "now , consider  @xmath155 , @xmath156 $ ] , the other sides of  @xmath143 , starting from  @xmath151 and counter - clockwise turning around  @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath157 be the reflection of  @xmath143 in  @xmath155 .",
    "let  @xmath158 be the vertex shared by  @xmath159 and  @xmath155 with @xmath160 .",
    "then , around  @xmath158 , there are @xmath74  copies of  @xmath143 , @xmath143 being taken into account .",
    "if we recursively repeat the process of copying starting from the @xmath157 s , there will be overlapping : starting from @xmath161 and looking at its sides on the right - hand side , after @xmath74@xmath852 iterations , we get @xmath162 .",
    "accordingly , we have to give rules in order to avoid overlapping . to this purpose",
    ", we shall say that the @xmath157 s we have just defined with @xmath156 $ ] are the * main sons*. each main son have @xmath163  * brothers * , @xmath163  being @xmath74@xmath853 or @xmath74@xmath854 , depending on a circumstance to which we turn now .",
    "consider @xmath155 , a side of  @xmath143 in the angle  @xmath154 with @xmath164 and @xmath165@xmath852 .",
    "the vertices of  @xmath155 are @xmath158 and  @xmath166 . in order to delimit regions which do not overlap but",
    "completely cover the complement of  @xmath143 in the angle  @xmath154 , we continue @xmath155 a , d @xmath167 both to the left .",
    "now , it is easy to see that around @xmath158 and outside @xmath143 , we have @xmath168  copies of the angle  @xmath154 , so that outside @xmath157 and around  @xmath158 there are @xmath168@xmath851 copies of  @xmath154 . on the other side ,",
    "there are @xmath168@xmath852 copies of  @xmath154 as from the continuation of  @xmath167 we have to take into account the angle which is in  @xmath143 and that which is in  @xmath157 .",
    "so that for , in each region @xmath169 and outside  @xmath157 @xmath74@xmath853 copies of  @xmath154 .",
    "we remain with the examination of @xmath170 and @xmath171@xmath852 .",
    "when @xmath171@xmath852 , @xmath147 plays the role of  @xmath167 , so that in this case , the number of angles left in the region @xmath172 , is also @xmath74@xmath853 . when @xmath170 , the region is  @xmath173 which is smaller than a region @xmath169 with @xmath164 .",
    "the region is smaller than  @xmath48 by an angle which is equal to  @xmath154 , so that this time we have @xmath168@xmath852 copies of @xmath154 close to  @xmath174 and @xmath168@xmath852 of them to close to  @xmath175 , so that we get @xmath74@xmath854 copies of  @xmath154 . accordingly , in this case , we can see that it is possible to split @xmath154 into copies of  @xmath143 and copies of  @xmath176 where @xmath176 has the same angle as @xmath154 but with a depth reduced by  2 : if @xmath143 has recursion depth  @xmath177 , with @xmath177 finite or infinite integer , @xmath157 with @xmath178@xmath85@xmath179 $ ] has depth  @xmath177 + 1 , so that any infinigon in an @xmath176 has depth at least @xmath177 + 2 .",
    "note that @xmath168@xmath851 steps of recursion are needed in order the vertices of  @xmath143 should be completely covered .",
    "this time , the regions have to be changed .",
    "consider the previous setting with the same notations .",
    "if we continue the side  @xmath155 , it is not a side of an adjacent infinigon : the continuation is a bisector of an interior angle of an infinigon which shares @xmath158 with @xmath155 .",

    "if @xmath118  too is odd , then we get a more complex situation .",
