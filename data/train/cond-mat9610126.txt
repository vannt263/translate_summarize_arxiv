    "conformations of a slender elastic rod were originally viewed as an interesting problem in classical elasticity theory .",
    "kirchhoff @xcite was the first to make significant headway towards a complete solution .",
    "almost a century later , as polymers became the subject of intense study , interest in the problem picked up once again@xcite . after the discovery of biological polymers  nucleic acids and proteins  researchers recognized the importance of predicting the elastic shape of linear molecules .",
    "the shape ( `` tertiary structure '' ) of dna and rna plays an important role in the processes of replication and transcription . because of this a number of authors",
    "have analyzed various aspects of elastic dna conformation @xcite for both closed ( circular ) @xcite and open ( linear ) @xcite configurations .",
    "the approaches taken include lagrangian mechanics @xcite , ( numerical ) molecular dynamics @xcite and statistical mechanics@xcite . despite significant progress @xcite",
    ", the equilibrium configurations of infinitely long open dna have not been analytically described .",
    "our main aims are to set up a formalism for obtaining equilibrium configurations ; to find one such conformation for stretched twisted dna , and to set up a model of plectonemic transition to compare with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the work reported here is based on two major results obtained over a century apart .",
    "kirchhoff @xcite provided the basic framework of elasticity theory .",
    "he observed that the equations of equilibrium that describe an elastic rod are formally identical to the equations of motion of a heavy symmetric top with one point fixed ( see figure [ duality_fig ] ) .",
    "the rod hamiltonian is identical to the top lagrangian , with arclength mapping onto time .",
    "this duality provides an added insight into the nature of the solutions .",
    "white s theorem @xcite provides another crucial analytical tool .",
    "this important theorem relates the linking number  a natural topological invariant of strings and ribbons  to two manageable components , each calculable in terms of locally defined quantities . according to white s theorem , @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 is the linking number , while @xmath2 , the twist , monitors the twist of the molecule about its axis , and @xmath3 , the writhe , records the contortions of the axis .",
    "this theorem greatly simplifies the problem of formulating a constraint on the linking number .",
    "in addition we make use of the results of fixman and kovac @xcite and marko and siggia@xcite to develop thermal effects of the plectonemic transition .",
    "the elastic model of dna represents the molecule as a slender cylindrical elastic rod . to model external forces and torques",
    "the rod is stretched ( in the @xmath4 direction ) by a force @xmath5 and is required to have a fixed @xmath6 ( see figure [ model_fig ] top ) .",
    "the rod is parametrized by arclengh , @xmath7 . at each point",
    "@xmath7 we describe the rod by relating the local coordinate frame @xmath8 to the frame @xmath9 rigidly embedded in the curve in its relaxed configuration . the relationship between the stressed and unstressed local frames",
    "is specified by euler angles @xmath10 needed to rotate @xmath9 into @xmath11 ( see figure [ model_fig ] bottom ) .",
    "the shape of the backbone @xmath12 is traced out by the unit tangent @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 , a unit normal , keeps track of the twist , @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we will often omit @xmath7-dependence for brevity .",
    "we also make use of the notation @xmath15 .",
    "then , @xmath16    let the elastic constants of bending and torsional stiffness be denoted , respectively , by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and let @xmath19 be the lengh of the rod .",
    "the energy of the twisted , stressed rod is the sum of bending and twisting energies and the potential energy produced by the stretching force @xmath5 . using ( [ t_eqn ] ) and ( [ n_eqn ] ) ) : @xmath20 using ( [ t_eqn ] ) and ( [ n_eqn ] ) in ( [ energy_temp ] ) we obtain @xmath21    the feature that sets this work apart from previous attempts and allows us to unambiguously determine a unique configuration for a given set of initial conditions is the constraint of maintaining a fixed linking number , @xmath6 .",
    "although linking number is usually associated with closed curves , the bound ends of our string allow us to define a fractional linking number for it .",
    "a caveat is that the local expressions we derive are only valid for the configuration ( extended ) we consider .",
    "white s theorem @xcite allows us to express @xmath6 in terms of its components , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . using ( [ t_eqn ] ) and([n_eqn ] ) : @xmath22 a local expression for twist follows straightforwardly , as evidenced by the far right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tw_eqn ] ) .",
    "the writhe , however , is not yet suitable for use as a lagrange multiplier . to express it as an integral of a local quantity we use a theorem by fuller@xcite .",
    "the theorem allows us to define @xmath3 locally using a diffeomorphism onto a _ reference _ curve , @xmath23 .",
    "( once again , we must stress that a different configuration , e.g. a circular plasmid , would require a different reference curve , producing slightly modified local expressions ) .",
    "the writhe is expressed as r = wr_r+_0^l ds , [ fuller_thm ] where @xmath24 is the writhe of the reference curve . finding a suitable reference curve proves crucial .",
    "the best choice is also the simplest - a straight line @xmath25 .",
    "this gives @xmath26 and @xmath27 . substituting ( [ t_eqn ] ) into ( [ fuller_thm ] )",
    "we obtain r=_0^l(-1 ) ds [ wr_eqn ] combining ( [ tw_eqn ] ) and ( [ wr_eqn ] ) we are led to the simple expression for @xmath6 : k=-_0^l ( + ) ds [ lk_eqn ] thus we have derived a simple conservation law that expresses the invariance of @xmath6 . inserting @xmath28 into the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e_eqn ] ) , with @xmath29 a lagrange multiplier , the expression to be minimized becomes @xmath30 dna conformations of minimum energy are found among the extrema of @xmath31 .",
    "we find the extrema of @xmath31 by applying standard variational techniques to ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the resulting euler - lagrange equations for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are :    @xmath35    a central goal is to find a unique conformation of the rod given a set of externally imposed constraints , @xmath5 and @xmath36 , where @xmath19 is the length of the rod . we find that equations ( [ theta_eqn ] ) and ( [ angles_eqn ] ) support two types of solutions .",
    "the first is a family of twisted vertical lines : = 0 ; = 0 ; ( s)=(2 k / l)s the energy of the straight line follows directly from ( [ e_eqn ] ) : e_line=(k / l)^2    the second family of solutions can be extracted from ( [ theta_eqn ] ) .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ theta_eqn ] ) by @xmath37 and integrating once we can rewrite ( [ theta_eqn ] ) in the following form ( @xmath38 ) : @xmath39 these `` writhing '' solutions are characterized by the roots @xmath40 of the cubic polynomial in the denominator of ( [ u_eqn ] ) ( see figure [ poly_fig ] ) .",
    "one of the roots , either @xmath41 or @xmath42 , is @xmath43 . if @xmath44 is a single root , then the configurations form `` superhelices . ''",
    "if @xmath44 is a double root ( @xmath45 ) the molecule supports a soliton - like excitation ( see figure [ energy_fig ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 takes on values between @xmath47 and @xmath42 , the quadrature turning points .",
    "the expressions for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and other quantities of interest follow by quadratures .",
    "the integrals are easily evaluated in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "we have investigated the properties of solutions to ( [ angles_eqn ] ) and ( [ theta_eqn ] ) , with the bending and torsional stiffness , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , appropriate to dna @xcite . using both numerical and analytical methods",
    "we find that , given a particular @xmath50 , the member of the writhing family with the lowest energy is the soliton configuration ( @xmath45 ) ( see figures [ poly_fig ] and [ energy_fig ] ) .",
    "the shape of this solution is defined by the following relationship between the arclengh @xmath7 and @xmath38 : s(u)= ( ) [ soliton_s_eqn ] where the lower root , @xmath47 , is given by @xmath51 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are similarly determined .",
    "a very interesting quantity is the energy of the soliton and its relationship to that of the twisted line solution ( which are both infinite in the limit @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 \\geq 0 \\label{soliton_e_eqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it s clear from ( [ soliton_e_eqn ] ) that the @xmath54 , while smaller than the energies of the other members of the `` writhing '' family , is always _ greater _ ( by a _ finite _",
    "amount ) than the energy of the twisting line configuration satisfying the same conditions .",
    "thus we find that an extended solution that minimizes energy and has a specified @xmath36 it is _ always _ a twisted straight line .",
    "to check stability we perturb the straight line solution @xmath55 .",
    "the perturbation calculation shows that the non - trivial zero - energy mode satisfies ( a-(f- ) ) ( s)=0 [ perturb_eqn ] thus for @xmath56 the straight line @xmath57 is stable to small fluctuations .",
    "what happens to the molecule when the @xmath36 approaches the critical value ?",
    "our results strongly indicate that the molecule attempts to loop over and pass through itself to shed a unit of @xmath36 and thus starts to form a plectonemic bubble . in this sense",
    "the twisted rod is in a metastable state .",
    "the plectoneme plays the role of the `` bounce '' via which a system tunnels out of the false vacuum . beyond the transition to local instability the plectonemes ought to proliferate . to explore this scenario",
    "we formulate a very simple model of the plectonemic transition of stretched twisted dna and compare its predictions with recent beautiful experiments by strick et al.@xcite      the model is diagrammed in fig .",
    "[ plect_fig ] . in the following all quantities",
    "are normalized by the lengh @xmath19 .",
    "dna researchers prefer to use @xmath58 to measure topological properties of dna . here",
    "@xmath59 is the natural link of the unstressed dna molecule ; b - dna has one right - handed twist every @xmath60 .",
    "we will follow this notation .",
    "the molecule is constrained to have a total link @xmath61 .",
    "the plectonemic fraction takes up @xmath62 leaving @xmath63 straight .",
    "the plectoneme has a radius @xmath64 and a pitch @xmath65 .",
    "the straight portion is twisted to its critical value @xmath66 .",
    "the actual twist is slightly below critical@xcite , but numerical results indicate that the precise value ( which depends weakly on @xmath19 ) is adequately approximated by that of an infinite string@xcite . guided by `` twist conservation '' implied by eqns .",
    "( [ angles_eqn ] ) we assign the same rate of @xmath67 to the plectoneme .",
    "the remaining link , @xmath68 , is absorbed by the plectoneme s @xmath69 .",
    "let us account the link distribution : @xmath70 because the plectoneme has the same rate of twist as the line , we can read off its writhe from eqn .",
    "( [ plect_inv_eqn ] ) . at the same time",
    "the writhe of a plectoneme can be expressed as a function of @xmath65 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "this gives us a constraint : [ plect_constr_eqn ] = wr_p=    up to now we have not considered any thermal effects or corrections .",
    "our aim is to build a formalism of obtaining equilibrium zero - temperature solutions about which a thermodynamic theory can be obtained ( e.g. by considering fluctuations ) @xcite .",
    "however , because the experiments we are examining contain a regime in which thermal effects play a significant role @xcitewe must consider them .",
    "marko and siggia @xcitehave derived the free energy of a plectoneme in their examination of fluctuations about helical structures . to within order",
    "unity constants @xmath71 the first two terms in ( [ plect_free_eqn ] ) are elastic contributions from curvature and twist , respectively .",
    "the next line is the hard core interaction ( @xmath72 nm @xcite ) .",
    "the last term is the entropic penalty incurred for winding too tightly @xcite .",
    "( it is interesting to note that although we include the last term in our model , its value is _",
    "always negligible_. ) setting the plectonemic fraction x we use ( [ plect_constr_eqn ] ) and ( [ plect_free_eqn ] ) to minimize @xmath73 with respect to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "next let us determine the thermal behavior of the straight - line segment .",
    "such behavior for the _ untwisted _ rod has been examined in some detail by fixman and kovak @xcite .",
    "[ perturb_eqn ] allows us to make use of their results provided we replace @xmath5 with @xmath74 .",
    "siggia provided a valuable summary of their results in an approximate interpolation formula @xcite .",
    "we employ the above substitution in siggia s result to solve for the thermal shortening of the straight portion of the molecule .",
    "@xmath75 is the actual observed extension : = ( ( 1-z / x)^-2 - 1)+z / x    in the final analysis we compute the optimum plectonemic fraction @xmath62 and the extension @xmath75 for a given @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ trans_fig ] side by side with experimental results @xcite .",
    "because our model is a very simple one , and we have made no attemts to compute exact parameters ( i.e. critical winding , etc . ) we can not claim perfect agreement .",
    "nonetheless the resemblance is striking .",
    "our model shows the shift from purely thermal behavior for very small @xmath76 to a transition completely driven by elastic considerations for larger @xmath76 s and forces .",
