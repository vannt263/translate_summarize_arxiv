    "the dependence of the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations in an inflationary universe on hidden assumptions about the physics on length scales much smaller than the planck length has been recently studied in refs .",
    "_ a priori _ this dependence comes about since in typical scalar - field - driven inflationary models the duration of the period of expansion is so long that the physical wavelengths of comoving modes which correspond to the present large - scale structure of the universe are much smaller than the planck length at the beginning of inflation . in weakly coupled scalar field models of inflation ,",
    "the spectrum of fluctuations is calculated by assuming that fluctuation modes start out in the vacuum ( i.e. minimum energy density ) state at the beginning of inflation and subsequently evolve as determined by the equations of motion .",
    "it is hence not unreasonable to expect that modifications of the physics on trans - planckian scales could affect the final spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "while the correct theory of trans - planckian physics is not known , possible effects of the new physics can be modeled by changes in the dispersion relation of the fields corresponding to linear cosmological fluctuations .",
    "such an approach was used earlier @xcite to study the possible dependence of the spectrum of black hole radiation on trans - planckian physics .",
    "indeed , for a class of dispersion relations which deviate so strongly from the usual one such that the evolution of the mode functions is highly non - adiabatic and the effective frequency becomes imaginary , it was found that the spectrum of fluctuations is modified in a significant way compared to what is obtained for a linear dispersion relation @xcite . as shown in @xcite , the final spectrum of fluctuations",
    "is unchanged if the change in the dispersion relation is not too drastic , the wave function evolves adiabatically , and hence the wkb approximation is valid throughout the evolution .",
    "two major deficiencies in the previous work concerned the choice of initial conditions and the fact that complex dispersion relations were required in order to obtain significant deviations from the standard results . in the previous papers , the assumption was made that the state starts out as the one minimizing the energy density .",
    "however , if the dispersion relation differs greatly from the linear one , in particular if it becomes complex , the physical motivation for choosing this state becomes unclear .",
    "this problem does not arise in a bouncing universe . in this case , modes corresponding to present cosmological scales could well have had a physical wavelength smaller than the planck length at the bounce point , but at early ( pre - bounce ) times , the wavelength was larger than the planck length .",
    "in this context , initial conditions can be set up at some very early pre - bounce time during which the mode obeys a linear dispersion relation and the physical meaning of the minimum energy density state is clear .",
    "it is thus interesting to study the spectrum of fluctuations in a bouncing universe which is asymptotically flat such that the choice of initial vacuum becomes unambiguous .",
    "it is also interesting to exhibit a case where complex dispersion relations are not needed .",
    "although complex frequencies are standard in classical physics and in quantum mechanics , they seem to be more problematic in the context of quantum field theory .    in this article , we find an example of a bouncing universe in which the spectrum of fluctuations depends sensitively on changes in the physics at length scales smaller than the planck length , without requiring complex frequencies at high wavenumbers , thus improving on the second major deficiency of previous work .",
    "another reason for investigating the dependence of the spectrum of fluctuations on modifications of trans - planckian physics in a bouncing universe is that one could expect ( however , as we show , this is not correct ) that the deviations in the spectrum incurred during the pre - bounce period when the wavelength is blue - shifting in the trans - planckian regime will cancel with the deviation in the post - bounce trans - planckian regime when the mode is being red - shifted .",
    "such a result would then lead to the expectation that the results on the dependence of the spectrum of fluctuations on changes in the trans - planckian physics might be different in the case of black holes and ( non - bounce ) inflationary cosmology . a third reason for analyzing a bouncing universe",
    "is that there has recently been a lot of interest in the field of string cosmology in bouncing universe models . in the einstein frame ,",
    "the pre - big - bang scenario @xcite starts in a collapsing dilaton - dominated phase , and the same is true in the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite .",
    "our arguments show that trans - planckian effects could change the predictions of standard cosmological perturbation theory in these examples .",
    "a model for the evolution of the scale factor in a bouncing inflationary universe is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the value of @xmath2 at the center of the bounce , and @xmath3 is the hubble expansion ( contraction ) rate during the period of exponential expansion ( contraction ) .",
    "the idea of the calculation is to assume an initial spectrum of fluctuations at some early time @xmath4 when the wavelength of all modes of interest is much larger than the planck length , to propagate the perturbation modes through the bounce and calculate the final spectrum at time @xmath5 . in this model , one of the difficulties encountered in the previous work @xcite , namely the problem of specifying the initial state in the trans - planckian regime ,",
    "is overcome .",
    "however , it is necessary now to set up initial conditions on wavelengths which typically also are much larger than the hubble radius .",
    "the latter problem can be overcome by considering a bouncing universe which is radiation - dominated in the asymptotic past and future , e.g. @xcite @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants . another toy model",
    "in which it is possible to set up well motivated initial conditions on scales much smaller than the hubble radius and at the same time much larger than the planck scale is a model in which the universe is asymptotically flat both at large positive and negative times : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) denote the asymptotic size of the universe and the size at the bounce , respectively , and @xmath13 determines the time scale of the bounce , i.e. the time over which the scale factor changes . in the above , we are using conformal time @xmath14 , and employing the convention that the scale factor carries dimension of length while the comoving coordinates ( including conformal time ) are dimensionless .    finally , a comment is in order on the issue of backreaction .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the energy density of the particles created by trans - planckian physics can contribute in a significant way to the background energy density .",
    "we do not address this interesting question since this clearly comes as a second step once a case where the spectrum is modified has been explicitly exhibited . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the first question since it would be useless to treat the backreaction question if no well - motivated example where the spectrum is modified can be found .",
    "however , it should be clear that , once this is done ( as shown in the present article ) , this problem becomes the central question in the study of trans - planckian physics in cosmology .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the arguments which show that no change in the final spectrum of fluctuations of a scalar matter field in a bouncing universe is expected independent of the dispersion relation , provided that the wkb approximation remains justified . we give a qualitative reason to expect changes in the amplitude of the final spectrum for dispersion relations for which the adiabatic approximation breaks down .",
    "as mentioned above , our analysis assumes that perturbation theory remains justified and back - reaction can be neglected @xcite . in section iii",
    "we study a concrete model , namely the asymptotically flat bouncing universe given by ( [ model2 ] ) with a dispersion relation modified in the trans - planckian regime according to the prescription of corley and jacobson @xcite .",
    "we show that , as expected , both the overall amplitude and the shape of the spectrum differ from what is obtained for the linear dispersion relation , without ever requiring the effective frequency to become imaginary .",
    "the change in the spectrum is produced by an interesting combination of effects due to the modified dispersion relation and the driving term for parker particle production @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for a minimally coupled free scalar matter field @xmath15 in a universe with scale factor @xmath16 in momentum space takes on the simple form @xmath17 making use of the re - scaling @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the comoving wavenumber linked to the physical wavenumber by the relation @xmath20 . in the above",
    ", a prime denotes the derivative with respect to conformal time .",
    "the previous equations are valid for a spacetime with flat spatial sections .",
    "the advantage of considering a test scalar field and/or gravitational waves is that we do not need to address the origin of the dynamics of the scale factor .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of density perturbations .",
    "however , the friedmann equation reads @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the energy density .",
    "this means that a bounce is consistent with the einstein equations only if @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    ", it would imply @xmath26 for each component .",
    "therefore , it seems that it is inconsistent to use eq .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) if the scale factor behaves such that there is a bounce .",
    "there are two ways out of the previous argument .",
    "the first one is the following .",
    "if @xmath24 , then eq .  ( [ eom1 ] ) takes the form @xmath27 .",
    "in addition the eigenfunctions of the three - dimensional laplacian operator are no longer planes waves . however ,",
    "if we restrict ourselves to modes with wavelengths much smaller than the curvature radius , then they do not feel the curvature of the spacelike section and we can safely work with eq .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) .",
    "it could be checked that this is indeed the case for the wavenumbers considered in the example presented in the following section .",
    "another possibility is to use the `` nonsingular universe construction ''  @xcite . in this case , it is definitely possible to get a spatially flat bounce .",
    "what happens is that the higher derivative terms become important at the bounce and enable the evasion of the previous argument by supplying other terms in the analog of the first friedmann equation . in conclusion , although in this article we consider a scale factor with a bounce , we can nevertheless work with eq .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) , i.e. we let the nonsingular universe construction enter only via the scale factor .    the method introduced in @xcite to study the dependence of the spectrum of fluctuations on trans - planckian physics is to replace the linear dispersion relation @xmath28 by a non standard dispersion relation @xmath29 where the function @xmath30 is _ a priori _ arbitrary . in the context of cosmology",

    "therefore , the above expressions of @xmath155 and @xmath156 are always well - defined .",
    "finally , interestingly enough , the two coefficients @xmath155 and @xmath156 have a similar structure to one of the corresponding coefficients found in ref .",

    "the leading order is the vacuum spectrum with spectral index @xmath179 and the next - to - leading order ( proportional to @xmath159 ) has the form of a complicated function of @xmath42 times superimposed oscillations .",

    "we also see that the deviation is minimum around @xmath150 ( for these values of the parameters ) because , as already mentioned above , in this case the term @xmath54 almost never dominates .",
    "although the present example is only a toy model , it is quite interesting to see that it bears some close resemblance with the other example of a modified spectrum found in ref .",
    "this suggests that the features previously exhibited may be valid in general .",
    "we have thus reached our main goal : find an example where the initial conditions can be fixed naturally , where the frequency never becomes complex and where the final spectrum is modified .",

    "in this paper we have studied the dependence of the spectrum of a free scalar field in a bouncing universe on trans - planckian effects introduced via a modification of the free field dispersion relation .",
    "we have found that both the amplitude and the slope of the spectrum depend on the dispersion relation , assuming that the dispersion relation leads to non - adiabatic evolution of the mode functions on trans - planckian physical length scales .",
    "such non - adiabatic evolution is possible without requiring the effective frequency to become imaginary .",

    "the calculation we presented here is free of two of the possible objections against the earlier work .",
    "the first objection was that the use of the minimum energy density state as initial state is not well defined on trans - planckian scales if the dispersion relation differs dramatically from the linear one ( which it has to in order to get non - adiabatic evolution ) . in our present work ,",
    "the initial conditions are set in the low curvature region and on length scales larger than the cutoff length but smaller than the hubble radius , where the choice of initial vacuum state is well defined .",
    "the second objection concerned the use of dispersion relations for which the effective frequency is imaginary in some time interval .",
    "no imaginary frequencies are used in the present model .",
    "the results obtained in this paper apply also both to bouncing universe backgrounds described by the two other models mentioned in the introduction . in the case of the first model ( where the scale factor is given by an hyperbolic cosine )",
    ", similar results would hold if we would match the _ local minkowski vacuum _",
    "( wkb vacuum ) at some initial time and express the results in terms of the wkb vacuum state at the corresponding post - bounce time .",
    "however , in that case , the initial conditions are not easy to justify since they have to be set on length scales larger than the hubble radius .",
    "obviously , we could consider that model and let the scale factor make a further transition to an asymptotically radiation- dominated or asymptotically flat stage at very large initial and final times . in this case , it is very likely that results similar to the ones we obtained here in model ( [ model2 ] ) would be obtained .",
