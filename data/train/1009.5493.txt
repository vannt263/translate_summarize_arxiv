    "we would like to study unflavoured decays of light neutral pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this reduces the particle content to @xmath1 , @xmath2 and eventually @xmath3 , ruling out @xmath4 decays that violate hypercharge conservation and are suppressed by @xmath5 ( two - photon decays are further suppressed by @xmath6 compared to hadronic ones ) .",
    "standard model is thus reduced to qcd ( extended eventually only by qed corrections ) which is successfully described by an effective theory known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "the @xmath1 meson being the lightest meson can not decay to other hadronic states .",
    "its dominant decay mode ( with more than 98% probability ) is @xmath7 and is connected with the adler - bell - jackiw triangle anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 vertex is closely connected with other allowed @xmath1 decay modes : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( with branching ratios  @xcite : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , respectively ) . in order to describe these processes with sufficient precision",
    "one can employ two - flavour chpt at appropriate order .",
    "this can simply incorporate corrections to the current algebra result attributed either to @xmath15 masses or electromagnetic corrections with other effects hidden in the low energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "naively , two - flavour chpt should converge very fast and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) should be sufficient from the point of view of today s experiments .",
    "however , as we are exploring the anomalous sector which is poorly known , phenomenologically richer @xmath0 chpt must be also used in order to obtain numerical prediction for low energy constants .",
    "this on the other hand enables to describe @xmath16 in the same framework .",
    "the motivation for our study is both theoretical and experimental .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath17 represents ( probably ) the most important example of the triangle anomaly in quantum field theory .",
    "it is interesting that at nlo the amplitude gets no chiral corrections from the so - called chiral logarithms @xcite and this motivate the calculation at nnlo even for @xmath18 chpt as was done in @xcite .",
    "it was found that there are indeed chiral logarithms generated by two - loop diagrams , but they are relatively small .",
    "it turns one s attention back to nlo order and contributions proportional to lecs . to this end",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath16 and inevitably @xmath19 mixing must be employed .",
    "we intend to do the full two - loop calculation of both @xmath20 and @xmath16 in three - flavour chpt . as a first step we will present here the calculation and result in the @xmath0 limit , i.e. for @xmath21 .    from the experimental side",
    "let us mention the primex experiment at jlab .",
    "it is designed to perform the most precise measurement of the neutral pion lifetime using the primakoff effect ( for first run results see @xcite ) .",
    "after jlab s 12 gev upgrade the extension of the experiment for @xmath2 and @xmath3 radiative width measurements is planned .",
    "neutral pion decay modes were studied with interesting results at ktev and it is promising to measure them in forthcoming na62 at cern .",
    "let us briefly summarize main points of chpt , for details see @xcite .",
    "starting point is the chiral symmetry of qcd , called chiral because it acts differently on left and right - handed quarks , which is exact for @xmath22 : @xmath23 where we dropped @xmath24 which is not a good symmetry due the anomaly .",
    "however , this anomaly is proportional to a divergence which must thus vanish in any order of perturbation theory .",
    "we are touching the problem referred as @xmath25 problem and we will avoid further discussion assuming that the ninth axial current is really not conserved and a possible divergence term is not present in qcd lagrangian ( referred itself as strong cp problem ) .",
    "assuming further confinement it can be proven that the axial subgroup of @xmath26 is spontaneously broken and the associated 8 goldstone bosons can be identified with pions , kaons and eta .",
    "the real non - zero masses of @xmath27 quarks , explicit symmetry breaking , are added as a perturbation and this expansion around the chiral limit together with the momentum expansion is referred to as chpt .",
    "standard power counting assumes that @xmath28 , and lorentz invariance implies that only even powers of derivatives ( @xmath29 ) can occur .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) thus starts at @xmath30 and one can have only tree diagrams .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is @xmath31 and can include one - loop contribution and similarly next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) is @xmath32 and can have up to two - loop diagrams . the last important point to be discussed here",
    "is the so - called chiral or external anomaly which would correctly incorporate the full symmetry pattern of qcd .",
    "it is connected with the fact that quarks carry also electromagnetic charge .",
    "in fact some green functions of qcd ( e.g. @xmath33 ) are not invariant under chiral symmetry , the difference was calculated first by bardeen @xcite and incorporated to the action by wess , zumino and witten ( wzw ) @xcite .",
    "this action starts at @xmath31 and thus the anomalous vertex shifts our counting by one order ( i.e. nnlo here is @xmath34 ) .",
    "we are primarily interested now in two - photon decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless let us summarize shortly their `` spin - off '' products , namely    * @xmath35 so called dalitz decay is important in normalization of rare pion and kaon decays .",
    "this was supported by its precise and stable prediction : for 30 years its official pdg value was same ( based on lampf experiment ) .",
    "however the last edition changed this number , based on aleph results and so it will have impact in other measurements via the normalization .",
    "the differential decay rate is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "* @xmath36 or double dalitz decay enables experimental verification of @xmath1 parity .",
    "ktev set recently new limits on parity and cpt violation @xcite * @xmath37 depends directly only on fully off - shell @xmath38 vertex .",
    "ktev measurement @xcite is off by @xmath39 from the existing models .",
    "it can set valuable limits on models beyond sm * @xmath40 , exotics and violation processes were also studied in @xmath1 decays .",
    "it includes mainly decay to neutrinos but is also interesting in beyond sm scenarios ( neutralinos , extra - light neutral vector particle , etc . )",
    "( for more references cf .",
    "the same modes are also possible in @xmath2 decays , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in the chiral limit the decay width is fixed by axial anomaly with the result @xmath41 it is in excellent agreement with experiment , which is the opposite situation to two - photon @xmath2 decay . in @xmath0 limit ( and also in chiral limit ) the two studied amplitudes are connected by wigner - eckart theorem @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 which is far from experiment @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "( note that using @xmath45 instead of @xmath46 makes this difference even larger . )",
    "the difference is attributed to @xmath19 mixing . at nlo order ,",
    "apart from tree diagrams coming from wzw and @xmath32 odd - parity lagrangian , we should include two one - loop topologies ( depicted in fig.[oneloop ] ) .",
    "the full one - loop calculation based on wave function renormalization and chiral expansion of masses and decay constants leads to : @xmath47 ^ 2,\\notag\\\\ & \\gamma(\\eta \\to \\gamma\\gamma)^{nlo } = \\gamma(\\eta \\to \\gamma\\gamma)^{ca } \\times \\bigr[\\frac{f_\\pi^2}{f_\\eta^2 } + \\frac{256\\pi^2}{9}\\label{gnlo}\\\\   & \\qquad\\times\\bigl((4 m_k^2 - 7 m_\\pi^2 ) c^{wr}_7 + 24 ( m_k^2 - m_\\pi^2 ) c^{wr}_8 \\bigr ) \\bigl]^2.\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note , as anticipated , the very simple , polynomial form of the results without logarithms .",
    "this is especially accomplished by correct replacement of @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 @xmath46 and @xmath45 in @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay respectively .",
    "it is clear from  ( [ gnlo ] ) that @xmath19 mixing must be hidden in @xmath50 lec .",
    "a rough estimate using resonance saturation suggests that @xmath50 must be much bigger than @xmath51 . for further discussion see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 , ( or equivalently nnlo , or two - loop ) calculation was already performed for @xmath17 in two - flavour chpt .",
    "natural extension for @xmath0 will supply us with both @xmath1 and also @xmath16 and enable to test and verify chiral expansion in odd intrinsic sector ( cf .",
    "study for even sector  @xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , clear that this calculation will be difficult : we are facing instead of one , three different scales in overlapping two - loop diagrams ( sunset and vertex ) .",
    "big effort was already given in the simpler two - point ( sunset ) case , and we still lack general analytic form .",
    "we plan to calculate it using method described in  @xcite but we need to go beyond the loop integrals computed there .",
    "there exists , however , apart from chiral limit , one non - trivial limit which can be used to obtain analytical result as it depends again only on one scale .",
    "it is an @xmath0 limit , where we set @xmath53 .",
    "this we can simply connect with @xmath30 mass : @xmath54 .",
    "the current algebra prediction , fixed by the anomaly , is free from any mass contribution .",
    "the mass enters explicitly at nlo order only , and therefore to obtain nnlo order we need to connect @xmath30 parameter with physical ( referring to a world where @xmath21 ) @xmath0 mass : @xmath55 + o(m_\\pi^4)\\ ] ] with chiral logarithm defined as @xmath56 . on the other hand connection of @xmath48 with physical @xmath0 decay constants",
    "is needed up to nnlo order @xmath57 the nnlo part was already calculated in general @xmath58 in @xcite and for our @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 using renormalization coefficients taken from @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , for @xmath0 limit @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays are related by wigner - eckart theorem and we thus need to calculate only one of these processes . following weinberg power - counting at nnlo we need to consider @xmath63 ) tree graphs with either @xmath64 ) one vertex from odd @xmath34 sector or @xmath65 ) one from odd ( even ) @xmath32 and second from even ( odd ) @xmath31 ; @xmath66 ) one - loop diagrams with one vertex with nlo coupling ( even or odd ) and @xmath67 ) the two - loop graphs with one vertex taken from the wzw lagrangian .",
    "all other vertices should be generated by the @xmath30 chiral lagrangian .",
    "case @xmath65 ) is treated via wave function renormalization .",
    "however , the odd - sector lagrangian at @xmath34 for three flavours has not yet been studied .",
    "the connected lec will be denoted as @xmath68 and set only a posteriori to cancel all local divergences .",
    "concerning one - loop feynman diagrams , we have already summarized them in fig.[oneloop ] , for nnlo the topology stays the same , we need just to insert higher - order vertices .",
    "non - trivial part of calculation is hidden in two loops .",
    "the feynman diagrams to deal with are summarized in fig.[twoloop ] .",
    "corrections ( tadpoles ) to propagators are not depicted .",
    "note that the most of diagrams are the same as in the two - flavour case . as anticipated by the nature of the anomaly",
    "there is one new topology ( the last one diagram in fig.[twoloop ] ) with anomalous vertex without direct photon insertion ( so - called chesire - cat smile ) . of course",
    ", into these graphs one should insert all possible combinations of pions , kaons and eta ( fortunately in @xmath0 limit with identical masses ) .",
    "we summarize the preliminary result in the following form ( @xmath69 is normalized as @xmath70 at lo , cf .",
    "eqs  ( [ gnlo ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 using renormalization coefficients taken from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 chiral coupling which would cancel local divergences in @xmath0 limit is denoted by @xmath74 and our exact calculation fixes its decomposition @xmath75.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we have summarized here our preliminary results concerning a two - loop calculation of @xmath76 in @xmath0 limit ( where @xmath77 ) .",
    "the word preliminary refers also to the fact that independent calculation with physical masses is in progress  @xcite and it should allow us to crosscheck here presented result in this limit .",
    "the possibility of studying two - photon decays of light - meson on lattice was very recently demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the simple analytical result can be very useful in this direction as one can vary masses without changing lecs .",
