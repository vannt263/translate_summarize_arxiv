    "excited - state transitions in atomic systems are finding an increasing range of applications including quantum information  @xcite , optical filters  @xcite , electric field sensing  @xcite and quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "they are also used for state lifetime measurements  @xcite , frequency up - conversion @xcite , the search for new stable frequency references  @xcite and multi - photon laser cooling  @xcite .",
    "however excited - state transitions are inherently more difficult to probe than ground - state transitions , especially if the lower state is short - lived .",
    "it is possible to probe an excited - state transition directly if the dipole moment is large enough  @xcite , but more commonly excited - state character is observed by mapping onto ground - state transitions using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in a ladder configuration . using eit it is possible to probe even relatively weak excited - state transitions , such as those to highly excited rydberg states  @xcite .",
    "nanosecond timescales have also been probed , effectively ` freezing out ' the motion of thermal atoms  @xcite .",
    "eit involving rydberg states has paved the way to recent advances in non - linear and quantum optics @xcite as the strong interactions among the rydberg atoms lead to large optical non - linearities , even at the single - photon level @xcite . in room temperature rydberg gases , the atomic interactions can lead to a non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite and evidence for strong van der waals interactions has been observed  @xcite . despite the considerable successes of ladder eit",
    ", there is a particular class of energy level schemes for which ladder eit can not be observed in a doppler - broadened medium .",
    "specifically , when the upper transition wavelength is longer than the lower ( ` inverted - wavelength ' system )  @xcite , the transparency window is absent as it is smeared out by velocity averaging .",
    "( color online ) toy model of our experiment . left : atoms prepared in a superposition of closely spaced excited states @xmath4 and @xmath5 demonstrate quantum beats at a frequency corresponding to the difference in their energies .",
    "right : driving an excited - state transition splits state @xmath4 into two dressed states @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the dynamics of the excited - state transition are written into the quantum beats .",
    "we show the level scheme ( top ) , the fourier spectrum , @xmath8 , of the fluorescence ( middle ) and the time - dependent fluorescence into an appropriately chosen polarization mode ( bottom ) .",
    "the fourier spectra are calculated by taking the magnitude of the fourier transform of the fluorescence signals .",
    ", width=326 ]    in this paper we make novel use of hyperfine quantum beats  @xcite to probe the excited - state transition dynamics of an ` inverted - wavelength ' ladder system in a thermal vapor .",
    "we find strong evidence for both rabi oscillations and sub - doppler autler - townes splitting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : toy_model ] we construct a toy model of our experiment , giving an overview of the physics involved .",
    "section  [ sec : experiment ] details our experimental procedure and in section  [ sec : results ] we present results in both the time - domain and the frequency domain .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] outlines a computer model that we developed to understand the signals , which we compare to the data in section  [ sec : analysis ]",
    ". the model yields good qualitative agreement which allows us to interpret features that we observe in the frequency domain .",
    "in this section we outline a toy model of our ladder system which includes the minimum possible complexity to illustrate the physical principle ( figure  [ fig : toy_model ] ) .",
    "the toy model considers a zero - velocity atom with ground state @xmath9 , an intermediate excited state @xmath4 and an upper excited state @xmath10 .",
    "there is also a reference state @xmath5 which is close in energy to @xmath4 .",
    "the transition from @xmath11 is driven by a short pulse whilst a continuous wave ( cw ) laser drives the excited - state transition from @xmath12 . for a sufficiently short excitation pulse",
    "the bandwidth exceeds the energy interval between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and a coherent superposition of the two states is prepared by the pulse .",
    "the dynamics of the excited - state transition are read out by measuring the fluorescence from states @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we begin our explanation by considering the simple case when the excited - state transition driving field is switched off ( left column of figure  [ fig : toy_model ] ) .",
    "once the coherent superposition of states @xmath4 and @xmath5 has been prepared , the total fluorescence decays exponentially according to the state lifetime .",
    "however , the fluorescence into an appropriately chosen mode , characterized by polarization and propagation direction , is modulated by beating  @xcite .",
    "these ` quantum beats ' represent interference between the two different quantum pathways associated with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the interference is erased if information regarding which pathway was taken is recovered ( e.g. spectroscopically resolving the fluorescence from each state ) . in our toy model the time - dependent fluorescence into a particular mode has the form of an exponentially decaying envelope modulated by beating .",
    "the modulus of the fourier transform of this time - dependent fluorescence , @xmath13 , allows us to read off the beat frequency ( see middle row of figure  [ fig : toy_model ] ) .",
    "states @xmath4 and @xmath5 have energy @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , and the beat frequency @xmath16 corresponds to the difference in energy .",
    "the visibility of the beats from a zero - velocity atom is set by a number of factors including the distribution of the population between the two states and the relative strengths with which the states couple to the selected fluorescence mode . in our experiment",
    "the visibility is limited by velocity averaging as well .    to understand the effects of driving the excited - state transition it is easiest to consider the dressed state picture ( right hand column of figure  [ fig : toy_model ] ) .",
    "cw driving of the excited - state transition splits @xmath4 into two dressed states , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , separated according to the rabi frequency of the driving field , @xmath17 .",
    "the original beat at frequency @xmath18 , is split into two distinct beats with frequencies , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , a new beat frequency is introduced with frequency @xmath17 .",
    "this beat frequency relates to rabi oscillations with atoms cycling on the excited - state transition .",
    "we note that unlike the initial quantum beat , this cycling leads to a modulation of the total fluorescence , not just a particular polarization mode . the fourier spectrum , @xmath13 , includes all information regarding autler - townes splitting of the state @xmath4 and rabi oscillations on the excited - state transition , @xmath12 . the more complicated form of the time - dependent fluorescence is shown in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : toy_model ] .",

    "the simplified level scheme and experimental setup are shown in figure  [ fig : exp]a and figure  [ fig : exp]b respectively .",
    "we use cesium atoms in a vapor cell ( length 2  mm ) at room temperature ( 19@xmath22c ) .",
    "the ladder scheme comprises the 6s@xmath2@xmath3=4 state as the ground state , 6p@xmath1@xmath23  = 5 as the intermediate state and 7s@xmath2@xmath24  = 4 as the upper excited state .",
    "the other 6p@xmath1 hyperfine states play the role of the reference state described in section  [ sec : toy_model ] .",
    "we excite the first transition using a short pulse ( fwhm of 1  ns ) of 852  nm light generated by a cw diode laser stabilized to the @xmath25 hyperfine transition and modulated by a pockels cell between two crossed , high extinction polarizers .",
    "the short pulse duration means that the pulse bandwidth spans the hyperfine energy splitting of the 6p@xmath1 manifold and therefore prepares a coherent superposition of several hyperfine states .",
    "it is this coherent superposition of states that leads to quantum beats in our system .",
    "the excited - state transition is driven by a counter - propagating , cw laser beam locked to the 6p@xmath26s@xmath27 ( 1469 nm ) transition using excited - state polarization spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "to best control the effects of driving the excited - state transition , it is desirable to minimize the spread of intensity of the excited - state transition driving field that the atoms experience . to achieve this",
    ", we only sample the center of the cw driving laser beam ( @xmath28 radius 0.3  mm ) where the intensity is most uniform , by virtue of tighter focusing of the preparation pulse ( @xmath28 radius 0.06  mm ) .",
    "both the laser beams are vertically polarized , and we detect fluorescence propagating in the horizontal plane .",
    "a narrow - band filter is used to select only fluorescence from the d@xmath0 transition and a polarizer selects a particular mode of this fluorescence .",
    "the fluorescence is measured using a single photon detector module which generates a ttl level pulse for each photon .",
    "the pulses are timed and counted by a high - bandwidth oscilloscope and in this way we achieve nanosecond timing resolution . to avoid saturating the counting module ,",
    "we ensure that the expected delay between photons is much longer than the dead time of the counting module ( @xmath2935  ns ) .",
    "we begin by considering the case of unperturbed hyperfine quantum beats .",
    "figure  [ fig : twocol](a ) and figure  [ fig : twocol](b ) show measurements of vertically and horizontally polarized fluorescence respectively , with the center of the excitation pulse incident at time @xmath30ns .",
    "as we noted in section  [ sec : toy_model ] , the total fluorescence is not modulated and so we see that the beating of the vertically and horizontally polarized fluorescence is out of phase . in figure",
    "[ fig : twocol](c ) we present the magnitudes of the normalized fourier transforms of these fluorescence measurements and in figure  [ fig : twocol](d ) we remove frequency components relating to the exponential decay envelope by subtracting the two signals ( see the appendix for details of normalization and subtraction ) .",
    "because the beating of the two polarization signals is out of phase we retain the quantum beat frequency components and so we observe peaks at 201 ,  251  and  452  mhz , corresponding to the 6p@xmath1 hyperfine splitting  @xcite ( highlighted with vertical dashed lines ) .",
    "the peak relating to the @xmath31 quantum beat ( 201  mhz ) is very weak as the population in these two states is limited .",
    "this restricted population is a result of both weaker coupling to the ground state and also detuning from the middle of the excitation pulse bandwidth which is centered on the @xmath32 transition .",
    "when we drive the excited - state transition the quantum beats are modified . for the driving field intensity at the center of the laser beam @xmath33  w@xmath34 , we present the vertically and horizontally polarized fluorescence measurements in figure  [ fig : twocol](e ) and figure  [ fig : twocol](f ) respectively , along with their fourier spectra in figure  [ fig : twocol](g ) and the spectrum of the difference signal in figure  [ fig : twocol](h ) .",
    "we can see the changes to the fourier spectra that we expected from considering the toy model in section  [ sec : toy_model ] .",
    "firstly the peak relating to the @xmath35 beat ( 251  mhz ) is split in two ( figure  [ fig : twocol](g , h ) ) .",
    "the origin of this effect is autler - townes splitting of the 6p@xmath36 atomic state , caused by driving the excited - state transition .",
    "secondly a new oscillation is present , leading to a peak at 100  mhz in this example ( figure  [ fig : twocol](g ) ) .",
    "this represents atoms performing rabi oscillations on the excited - state transition .",
    "the absence of this peak from the difference signal in figure  [ fig : twocol](h ) is because the rabi oscillations modulate the entire 852  nm fluorescence .",
    "therefore the oscillation is in phase between the vertically and horizontally polarized fluorescence and is removed in the difference signal .",
    "it is interesting to note that whilst the simple model outlined in section  [ sec : toy_model ] predicts that the splitting of the beat frequency would be equal to the frequency of the rabi oscillation , it is clear from figure  [ fig : twocol](g ) that this is not the case .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy stems from doppler effects which we explore and explain in section  [ sec : analysis ] using a comprehensive computer simulation outlined in section  [ sec : theory ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rawdata ] we present colorplots covering a range of excited - state transition laser driving intensities @xmath37  w@xmath34 , constructed from nine individual sets of intensity measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : rawdata](a ) shows the modulus of the fourier transform of the vertically polarized fluorescence measurements .",
    "the diagonal feature corresponds to the rabi oscillation , which increases in frequency with increasing laser power .",
    "figure  [ fig : rawdata](b ) shows the modulus of the fourier transform of the difference signal and the splitting of the @xmath35 beat into two separate branches is clear .",
    "( color online ) colorplots of the magnitude of the fourier transforms of the fluorescence measurements .",
    "( a )  vertically polarized fluorescence shows a diagonal feature that corresponds to rabi oscillations .",
    "( b )  the difference signal demonstrates a branched feature relating to autler - townes splitting .",
    "parts ( a ) and ( b ) relate to the highlighted regions of figure  [ fig : twocol](c , g ) and figure  [ fig : twocol](d , h ) respectively . , width=326 ]    we also point out some further , more subtle effects .",
    "first , the fluorescence decays more slowly as the longer lived 7s@xmath38 state is mixed into the 6p@xmath1 states .",
    "second , the total amount of measured 852  nm fluorescence decreases . this is partly because the atoms can now decay from the 7s@xmath38 state via the 6p@xmath2 manifold as well as the 6p@xmath1 manifold , but could also be due to hyperfine optical pumping caused by light leaking through the pockels cell between pulses .",
    "further consequences of this effect are discussed in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "finally we note that the higher frequency branch of the split @xmath35 quantum beats is stronger than the low frequency branch ( figure  [ fig : rawdata](b ) ) .",
    "this effect is even more exaggerated in the @xmath39 ( 452 mhz ) beat where we do not observe the low frequency branch at all ( figure  [ fig : twocol](d , g ) ) .",
    "the absence of the lower branch originates from doppler effects that we also discuss in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "here we develop a theoretical simulation to predict the behavior of our system .",
    "conceptually , it involves two steps .",
    "first the optical bloch equations for the system are solved numerically ; second , the time - dependent expectation value of a ` detection operator ' , @xmath40 , is calculated , giving the expected fluorescence @xcite .",
    "the operator has the form ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a coefficient relating to detection efficiency , * e * is a unit vector describing the polarization of the detected fluorescence and * d * is the electric dipole operator for the d@xmath0 transition of the atom .",
    "the final states @xmath43 include all of the magnetic sub - levels ( @xmath44 ) of the two 6s@xmath2 hyperfine ground states .",
    "we note that the expectation value of the operator @xmath40 is proportional to the square of the atomic dipole projected onto the detected polarization angle and measures the coupling of the atomic state to the field modes .",
    "the calculation process is repeated for a sample of velocity classes which are then summed and weighted according to a boltzmann distribution .",
    "the computation basis is fixed such that the linearly polarized excitation lasers drive only @xmath45 transitions , allowing our calculation to be performed in a set of mutually uncoupled @xmath44 subspaces .",
    "note that this basis might not be the energy eigenbasis due to uncompensated laboratory magnetic fields .",
    "however , any coherence developed between the @xmath44 subspaces as a consequence of this can be neglected since the duration of our experiment is much shorter than the relevant larmor precession timescale .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath46 in each of the nine @xmath44 subspaces , is calculated using a set of optical bloch equations ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the hamiltonian for each subspace , and @xmath49 is a decay operator .",
    "the rabi frequencies are calculated individually for each @xmath50 subspace and each subspace includes one state from each of the hyperfine levels : 6s@xmath51 ; 6p@xmath52 and 7s@xmath53 .",
    "this convenient sub - division offers a computational speed up that permits the simulation to be run on a desktop computer .    although the subspaces are not coupled by the driving laser fields",
    ", we note that they are not truly separate , since atoms can undergo spontaneous @xmath54 transitions resulting in a change of @xmath50 quantum number . instead of modeling this full behavior",
    ", we attribute the total rate of spontaneous decay of each state to @xmath45 transitions , thus conserving the total population in each subspace . in this way , we are able to capture the lifetimes of the states and retain the computational efficiency . furthermore , because the timescale of our experiment is set by a single atomic state lifetime , we are confident that the effect of these angular momentum changing processes is negligible , as there is insufficient time to redistribute atomic population amongst the @xmath50 subspace .",
    "in the final step of our model , we collate the populations and coherences from the nine subspaces into a single density matrix , giving the complete state of the atom as it changes in time . using the ` detection operator ' , we project the atomic dipole at each time step and hence infer both the linear and circularly polarized 852  nm fluorescence .",
    "( color online ) vertically polarized fluorescence : we compare the model ( black line ) and experimental data points ( blue ) for measured excited - state transition laser intensity @xmath55=(0,3,6,7 )  @xmath56 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "we note that the visibility of the peaks is always smaller than the model predicts .",
    "the incident light pulse occurs at time @xmath57  =  0  ns and the error bars are calculated from poissonian photon counting statistics  @xcite .",
    ", width=326 ]",
    "in this section we make a direct comparison between the computer simulation and the measured data . in figure  [ fig : comp ] we present the results of the vertically polarized fluorescence for both the experiment and simulation .",
    "the unperturbed hyperfine quantum beat signal fits well , and we see at least qualitative agreement for the perturbed beats . although the features are often more pronounced in the simulation than the data , there is a qualitative match between the data and theory . on the strength of this we can draw additional physical insight about the system .    in section  [ sec : results ] we noted that the splitting of the @xmath58 hyperfine quantum beat was unexpectedly smaller than the measured frequency of the rabi oscillation .",
    "we suggest this is similar to narrowed eit windows in thermal vapors @xcite where off - resonant velocity classes partially fill the transparency window left by resonant atoms .",
    "calculated contributions to the splitting of the @xmath59 quantum beat from different velocity classes are shown in figure  [ fig : fillin ] .",
    "the zero - velocity class ( bold , green ) shows a splitting that is consistent with the simulated excited - state transition rabi frequency , yet this is much larger than the splitting which appears in the total signal .",
    "figure  [ fig : fillin ] shows how contributions from off - resonant velocity classes fill in the gap .",
    "the inset compares this best fit calculated spectrum with our data and we see qualitative agreement , although we acknowledge a significant discrepancy in the simulated ( @xmath60  w@xmath34 ) and measured ( @xmath61w@xmath34 ) excited - state transition laser intensities .",
    "( color online ) calculated magnitude of the normalized fourier transform of the vertically polarized fluorescence : we show a break down of velocity class contributions , with dashed ( red ) lines showing individual velocity classes traveling away from the 852  nm laser , and solid ( blue ) lines showing velocity classes traveling towards the 852  nm laser .",
    "the velocity classes are spaced at 33  ms@xmath62 intervals and the bold ( green ) line shows the contribution from zero - velocity atoms .",
    "the gray shaded area shows the scaled sum of the signals and the calculation relates to probing a region with a uniform excited - state transition driving field intensity @xmath63w@xmath34 .",
    "the inset compares the data taken for measured cw driving field intensity @xmath64w@xmath34 shown in bold ( blue ) and the summed model ( gray shaded area and black line).,width=326 ]    we also noted in section  [ sec : results ] that the high - frequency branch of the split @xmath59 quantum beat makes a stronger contribution to the fourier spectrum than the low - frequency branch .",
    "this unexpected asymmetry can be explained by constructing a two - step argument : first , we note that the strongest beats arise from atoms experiencing a red doppler shift of the 852  nm laser .",
    "this moves the center of the frequency profile of the pulse between the two beating transitions , promoting the excitation of both levels as required for quantum beats .",
    "second , the atoms which experience a red - shift for the 852  nm laser see a blue - shift of the 1469  nm laser because the laser beams are counter - propagating .",
    "this blue - shift means that the dressed states represented in the higher frequency branch of the split quantum beat have a greater admixture of the 6p@xmath65=5 state , and as such a stronger coupling to the ground state .",
    "thus the imbalance between branches of the quantum beat comes from a bias towards a particular velocity class , and a bias within this velocity class to a particular branch .",
    "the asymmetry between branches is even stronger for the @xmath66 quantum beat as the @xmath67 hyperfine state is further in energy from the @xmath68 hyperfine state .",
    "consequently , only the high frequency branch of the splitting was observed and the lower - frequency branch is absent .",
    "( section  [ sec : results ] ) .    there are some remaining discrepancies between the simulation and the data .",
    "we found that when we used the cw driving field intensity as a fit parameter in the model , the best fit did not match or even scale linearly with the intensity we measured in the experiment .",
    "we believe that this might originate from optical pumping between excitation pulses .",
    "the high extinction polarizers each side of the pockels cell ( figure  [ fig : exp]b ) still allowed a few hundred nanowatts of 852  nm light to leak into the vapor cell for the 1  ms duration between pulses . for resonant velocity classes , this could have lead to an initial state other than the uniform distribution over the ground states that the computer simulation assumes .",
    "we have demonstrated a novel method using hyperfine quantum beat spectroscopy for observing sub - doppler autler - townes type splitting in an ` inverted wavelength ' ladder scheme which would not be observable in a continuously excited room - temperature vapor .",
    "a comprehensive model of the fluorescence gives qualitative agreement with our data , and we use it to gain physical insight into the process . by exploiting our method to its full potential",
    "it would be possible to combine information from both the autler - townes splitting and the rabi oscillations to achieve a complete read out of excited - state transition dynamics .",
    "our work on ladder excitation schemes contributes to a general effort towards the exploitation of rydberg atoms in a room temperature atomic vapor using multi - photon , step - wise excitation . in a wider context",
    ", our method offers a new means for investigating excited - state transitions in a room - temperature vapor .",
    "the authors would like to thank ifan hughes for stimulating discussions and acknowledge financial support from epsrc [ grant ep / k502832/1 ] and durham university .",
    "the data in this paper are provided in the supplemental material",
    "in figure  [ fig : twocol ] we present normalized fourier spectra of the time domain signals . here we inform the reader of the details of the normalization .",
    "we begin with the measured time domain quantities . for unperturbed beats ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to the horizontally and vertically polarised fluorescence respectively , and for the modified quantum beats @xmath71 and @xmath72 correspond to the horizontally and vertically polarised fluorescence respectively . these quantities are fourier transformed to give @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
