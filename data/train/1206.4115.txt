    "the high precision required to make a significant measurement of the primordial helium abundance presents challenges that are unique in nebular astrophysics .",
    "the recombination rate coefficients , needed to convert emission line intensities into ionic abundance ratios , must have an accuracy better than the precision expected for the derived abundance .",
    "usually we hope to measure abundances of most elements to an accuracy of 20 - 30% .",
    "the primordial helium problem requires recombination rates accurate to better than a percent , presenting unprecedented challenges to the atomic physics of the line formation .",
    "see brocklehurst ( 1972 ) and references therein for early seminal work in the field of theoretical he  i emissivities .",
    "we need four types of atomic data to calculate the case b recombination spectrum : level energies , transition probabilities , photoionization cross - sections , and collision rates .",
    "porter et al ( 2009 ) summarize the contributors to the error budget .",
    "energy uncertainties have always been negligible compared to other sources , and accurate transition probabilities have been available since kono & hattori ( 1984 ) .",
    "drake ( 1996 ) and drake & morton ( 2007 ) improved upon the latter still further .",
    "photoionisation cross - sections and collision rates represent the greatest sources of uncertainties in current standard calculations of he  i emissivities ( benjamin , skillman , & smits 1999 , hereafter bss99 ; porter et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "for the low - density , extragalactic observations used in primordial helium analyses ( peimbert , luridiana , & peimbert 2007 ; izotov , thuan , & stasiska 2007 ; aver , olive , & skillman 2010 ) , photoionisation cross - sections ( and , by extension , recombination coefficients ) are the greatest source of uncertainty ( porter et al .",
    "see ferland et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for a recent review of the errors in he  i emissivities and in primordial helium abundances .",
    "in this letter we update our earlier calculations of case b , he  i emissivities ( bauman et al . 2005 ; porter et al . 2005 , 2007 ) to include a large set of self - consistent , _ ab initio _ photoionisation cross - sections .",
    "we compare our present results with our previous work , with those by bss99 , and with those by almog & netzer ( 1989 ) .",
    "we present here a subset of our present results that is most applicable to primordial helium research .",
    "a much larger set is available in the electronic edition .",
    "the first large set ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) of modern , self - consistent photoionisation cross - sections was calculated by hummer & storey ( 1998 , hereafter hs98 ) .",
    "however , the full set has remained unpublished .",
    "ercolano & storey ( 2006 ) used the full set to produce accurate continuous emission spectra .",
    "the current work represents the first use in case b line emissivity calculations .",
    "another large set of photoionisation cross - sections was presented recently by nahar ( 2010 ) . because highly - accurate bound - bound absorption oscillator strengths obtained with hylleras - type wave functions are available ( drake 1996 )",
    ", we can readily apply a simple extrapolation method ( burgess & seaton 1960 ) to judge the accuracy of free - bound differential oscillator strengths at the ionization threshold .",
    "hs98 applied this method to several low - lying levels of he  i and tabulated results in their table 1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : compare2 ] , we compare those results with the _ ab initio _ calculations of @xmath5 levels from both nahar and hs98 .",
    "nahar s values disagree with the extrapolated cross - sections by as much as @xmath6 .",
    "the hs98 cross - sections are clearly more consistent with the drake results than are the nahar ( 2010 ) values .",
    "the target wave functions used in hs98 were derived from those of calvert & davison ( 1971 ) and were designed to fully represent the dipole and quadrupole polarizability of the he@xmath7 ground state and to include short - range correlation optimised on the energies of the @xmath5 states , which were known to be particularly difficult to represent .",
    "this target provides very accurate results at energies near threshold , as required for the temperature range and applications discussed here but is unsuitable at higher energies .",
    "the target used by nahar ( 2010 ) is extensive and implicitly treats polarization and correlation effects but it is not optimised for near threshold calculation or for the @xmath5 states .",
    "it is , however , applicable over a much larger energy range than that used in hs98 .",
    "we use the unpublished cross - sections described by hs98 . for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we rescale to agree at threshold to those extrapolated from the drake oscillator strengths and listed in table 1 of hs98 .",
    "we use the extrapolation procedure described by hs98 to obtain values for @xmath10 and @xmath9 , but these normalisations have only minor effects on the emissivities of the most important lines .     states relative to `` extrapolated '' drake ( 1996 ) results .",
    "nahar ( 2010 , blue circles ) , hs98 ( red crosses).,title=\"fig : \" ]    we follow hs98 and assume that recombination coefficients are fixed relative to hydrogen for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "all other aspects of our calculations are as described in bauman et al .",
    "briefly , this entails @xmath13-resolved levels for @xmath14 , a single `` collapsed '' level at @xmath15 , and collisions induced by electrons , protons , and he@xmath7 .",
    "the calculations are performed with a development version of the spectral simulation code cloudy ( last described by ferland et al .",
    "1998).-resolved code described by bauman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) has also been updated with the hs98 cross - sections .",
    "that code can be retrieved with a subversion client from https://svn.nublado.org/bauman/source . ]    following switzer & hirata ( 2008 ) , we also have added radiative bound - bound electric quadrupole transitions ( cann & thakkar 2002 ) .",
    "however , these transitions have a negligible effect on the present results ; we mention the change for completeness and to note that these transitions may be important for high - z he - like ions ( as in porter & ferland 2007 ) .",
    "finally , we note that we have compared our existing implementation of heavy particle angular momentum changing collisions to the new results by vrinceanu , onofrio , and sadeghpour ( 2012 ) and found excellent agreement .",
    "k. the three levels with the largest changes are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . see text .",
    "the differences will generally be smaller at finite densities.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we compare effective recombination coefficients in our new treatment with those of porter et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in figure  [ fig : alpha ] . for the majority of levels",
    "the change is @xmath19 .",
    "there are two clear exceptions , corresponding to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the cause is a programming error in our earlier renormalisation of peach ( 1967 ) cross - sections .",
    "there are only two levels affected . unfortunately , these are the upper levels of two of the most important lines in primordial helium abundance works : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the new results yield stronger emissivities for both lines .",
    "the next largest differences in figure  [ fig : alpha ] correspond to levels with only weak optical lines .",
    "this figure should be compared with figure 5 of aver , olive , & skillman ( 2010 ) .",
    "the principal effect is that for both @xmath22 and @xmath21 , the present results are greater than the earlier porter et al .",
    "works and are roughly the average of the bss99 results and our earlier work . our @xmath23 and @xmath24 results have also changed considerably , and ( within the plotted temperature range ) the ratios no longer cross the `` zero deviation line '' discussed by aver , olive , & skillman ( 2010).,title=\"fig : \" ]    we compare our new emissivities with bss99 for several strong lines in figure  [ fig : bss99 ] .",
    "this figure is directly comparable to figure 5 of aver , olive , & skillman ( 2010 ) .",
    "consistent with the discussion above , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are now in better agreement with bss99 , though important differences clearly remain .",
    "our calculations cover @xmath27  k ( in @xmath28  k steps ) and @xmath1  @xmath2 ( in 1 dex steps ) .",
