    "conformal field theory ( cft ) has proved to be a powerful tool in the description of universality classes of equilibrium critical models in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "it has successfully helped to understand and compute universal quantities and behaviours such as critical exponents , correlation functions , finite - size scaling , perturbations around fixed points and boundary conditions , among others .",
    "more recently , increased interest has been turned toward a larger class of conformal theories , namely the logarithmic conformal field theories ( lcft ) , so called because they involve scaling fields with inhomogeneous scaling transformations , which contain logarithmic terms .",
    "they are believed to describe the continuum limit of certain non - equilibrium lattice models , like dense polymers @xcite , sandpile models @xcite , dimer models @xcite and percolation @xcite , as well as the infinite series of the lattice models recently defined in @xcite .",
    "the distinctive characteristic of these lattice models is the fact that they all have intrinsic non - local features ; these are thought to be responsible for the appearance , in the continuum local theory , of logarithms in correlation functions .",
    "these non - local features also mean that exact calculations on the lattice are notoriously hard , thereby making a direct comparison with logarithmic conformal theory predictions equally hard .    in this regard",
    ", we believe that the two - dimensional abelian sandpile model is one of the lattice models where the full consequences of the logarithmic conformal invariance can be most thoroughly and transparently tested and exploited .",
    "all checks that could be carried out have been successful so far ( see @xcite ) ; these include various correlators in the bulk and on boundaries , the effects of boundary conditions , the determination boundary condition changing fields , the insertion of isolated dissipation and some finite - size effects .    up to now , the only known sources of logarithms in correlators are the insertion of dissipation at isolated sites @xcite and the height variables for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the former is somewhat trivial but nonetheless in full agreement with the principles of lcft ( in addition , the introduction of dissipation is in certain instances absolutely crucial as will be seen in section [ sec4 ] ) ; the logarithms produced in the presence of dissipation are not due to non - local features of the lattice model but follow quite simply from the fact that the inverse laplacian in two dimensions behaves logarithmically at large distances .",
    "in contrast , joint probabilities with heights @xmath8 are intrinsically non - local , and therefore much more important to check .    despite the mentioned triviality of the logarithmic nature of the inverse laplacian or green function @xmath9",
    ", its non - local properties can be viewed by means of a geometrical construction proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath10 is related to the number of two - rooted ( and therefore two - component ) spanning trees , such that both points @xmath11 belong to the same one - rooted subtree .",
    "the size @xmath12 of the one - component subtree imbedded into the spanning tree is distributed as @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the green function @xmath10 for two points separated by a distance @xmath5 is proportional to the integral over all components of size @xmath12 exceeding @xmath5 .",
    "below , we will see that this property of the green function is relevant for the appearance of logarithmic corrections in joint height probabilities .",
    "the only probabilities with heights @xmath8 that have been computed so far are the 1-site probabilities on the upper - half plane .",
    "because 1-site height probabilities on the upper - half plane may be viewed as chiral 2-site joint probabilities on the full plane , these could be used to make definite predictions as to the field theoretic nature of the bulk height variables in the scaling limit . in this way",
    ", it was predicted in @xcite that the height variable @xmath14 goes , in the scaling limit , to a primary field @xmath15 with conformal weights @xmath16 , while the higher height variables @xmath3 scale to a unique field @xmath17 ( up to normalization ) which is the logarithmic partner of @xmath15 in a specific lcft with central charge @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , this logarithmic theory turns out to be distinct from the well - known ( and best understood ) symplectic fermion ( triplet ) theory @xcite .",
    "if correct , these statements imply that the height 1 variable is the only one to have purely algebraic correlators .",
    "any multisite correlator involving at least one height variable @xmath8 necessarily contains logarithmic functions of the separation distances , powers of logarithms in case more than one height @xmath8 is involved .",
    "whereas this has been explicitely proved for general @xmath19-point , bulk correlators of height 1 variables @xcite , no comparable check has been done when a height @xmath8 is present .    in this article ,",
    "our purpose is to take a first step in this direction .",
    "we present here the detailed calculations of 2-site joint probabilities announced in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we compute , on the infinite discrete plane , the 2-site correlation functions @xmath20 of two height variables , one of which is @xmath21 , the other is @xmath22 or @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the 1-site probability of height @xmath25 on the infinite plane . given the field identifications conjectured in @xcite , conformal field theory predicts that the dominant term of the correlation functions is @xmath26 for some coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite . the explicit lattice calculations , to be detailed below , fully confirm these result , and exactly establish the values of coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the same arguments can be used to infer that the 2-site correlations of two heights bigger or equal to 2 decay like @xmath27 , but due to the complexity of the required combinatorics , the explicit lattice calculation of these correlations remains out of range for the moment .",
    "we consider the abelian sandpile model ( asm ) on a two - dimensional square grid @xmath28 .",
    "a random variable @xmath29 , which takes the integer values @xmath30 , is attached to each site @xmath31 , representing the height of sand at that site .",
    "a configuration @xmath32 of the sandpile at a given time is the set of values @xmath33 for all sites .",
    "the system starts its evolution from some initial state . in this paper",
    "we are going to investigate observable quantities in the bulk , when the thermodynamic limit is taken and the dependence on boundary details vanishes .",
    "so we can start with square lattice with open boundary conditions for convenience .    the discrete time dynamics with open boundary conditions",
    "is completely defined in terms of the toppling matrix @xmath34 , chosen to be the discrete laplacian on @xmath35 : @xmath36    a configuration is called stable if all height values satisfy @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . at time @xmath39 , the dynamics transforms the stable configuration @xmath40 into a new stable configuration @xmath41 as follows .",
    "we add a grain of sand at a random site @xmath38 by setting @xmath42 ( we assume that the site @xmath31 is chosen randomly with a uniform distribution on the grid @xmath35 ) .",
    "this new configuration , if stable , defines @xmath41 . if @xmath29 is bigger than 4 , the site @xmath31 becomes non - stable and loses four grains of sand , while all neighbours of @xmath31 receive one grain .",
    "note that if the site @xmath31 is on an ( open ) boundary where the number of neighbours is less than 4 , the system loses a corresponding number of grains .",
    "such sites are called dissipative . in terms of the toppling matrix ,",
    "if the site @xmath31 topples , the heights change according to @xmath43 after site @xmath31 has toppled , other sites may become unstable , in which case they topple too , according to the same toppling rule ( [ update ] ) . once all unstable sites have been toppled , a new stable configuration @xmath41 is obtained .",
    "one can show @xcite that this dynamics is well - defined : the order in which the unstable sites are toppled does not matter , and the new stable configuration @xmath41 is reached after a finite number of topplings , provided some of the sites ( at least one ) are dissipative .",
    "the long time behavior of the sandpile is described by the time invariant probability measure .",
    "it assigns all stable configurations their probability of occurrence , when the dynamics has been applied for a sufficiently long time so that the system has set in the stationary regime .    as such",
    ", the invariant measure one reaches might depend on the initial distribution . in the present case however , there is no dependence on the initial distribution because there is a unique invariant measure , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic limit of @xmath44 is what we want to compare with a conformal field theoretic measure .",
    "the number of stable configurations is @xmath45 , but only a small fraction of them keep reappearing under the dynamical evolution .",
    "the transient configurations exist at the initial stage of evolution and occur only a finite number of times . as a consequence",
    ", they all have a zero measure with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "the non - transient configurations are called recurrent and asymptotically occur with a non - zero probability .",
    "dhar has shown that the recurrent configurations all occur with equal probability under the asm dynamics , and that their total number is @xmath46 @xcite .    a practical way to test",
    "whether a configuration is recurrent or transient is to use the `` burning '' algorithm @xcite . given a recurrent configuration , this algorithm outputs the path followed by the fire to burn the configuration , which in turn defines a unique rooted spanning tree on @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite for details ) that the problem of computing the 1-site height probabilities @xmath24 , @xmath48 can be reduced to the problem of enumerating certain classes of spanning trees on @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that all branches of the spanning tree are directed to its root , located somewhere on the boundary .",
    "formally , the determinant of the laplacian @xmath34 enumerates spanning forests ( many - component trees ) with roots on open boundary sites .",
    "these spanning forests can be considered as spanning trees , if we add an auxiliary site and connect all boundary sites with it . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this boundary effect vanishes for the bulk .",
    "we will say that a site @xmath49 is reachable from site @xmath31 if the unique directed path on the spanning tree from @xmath31 to the root passes through @xmath49 . in this case",
    "@xmath31 is called a predecessor of @xmath49 .",
    "then the height probabilities at site @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 with @xmath52 is the number of spanning trees on @xmath35 such as the site @xmath49 has exactly @xmath53 nearest neighbour predecessors @xcite .",
    "let us consider the probability @xmath54 .",

    "this means that @xmath49 is reachable from no other site in @xmath35 , or equivalently , @xmath49 is a leaf .",
    "the simplest way to compute @xmath55 is to remove the bonds connecting @xmath49 to three of its neighbours , for instance @xmath56 as shown in fig .",

    "the size of the matrix @xmath71 becomes infinite but retains a rank equal to 4 , which implies that the determinant in ( [ p1_det ] ) reduces to a @xmath72 non - trivial determinant .",
    "the explicit form of the translationally invariant green function on the plane is @xmath73 with @xmath74 an irrelevant infinite constant .",
    "the ( finite ) numbers @xmath75 are given explicitly by @xmath76 let us mention symmetry properties of this function : @xmath77 after the integration over @xmath78 , it can be expressed in a more convenient form for actual calculations , @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",

    "the basic reason for this is that the spanning trees involved in @xmath55 are subjected to a local constraint , while those counting for @xmath51 , @xmath91 , must satisfy a global constraint . in the case of @xmath92 , for instance , a spanning tree is counted if the reference site is reachable from one and only one nearest neighbour . to illustrate the problem ,",

    "during recent years , considerable evidence @xcite has been gathered which strongly support the following assertions : ( i ) the abelian sandpile model is conformally invariant in the scaling limit ; ( ii ) conformal invariance is realized by a logarithmic conformal field theory , where some of the local fields belong to indecomposable virasoro representations , and consequently satisfy logarithmic scaling @xcite ; and ( iii ) the relevant logarithmic theory has central charge @xmath18 , and is distinct from the symplectic free fermion theory , also known as the triplet theory @xcite .",
    "we briefly review here what has been found concerning the height variables and their description by scaling fields .    in the abelian sandpile model ,",
    "the height @xmath193 at a bulk site @xmath194 can take four values .",
    "we accordingly consider four random lattice variables , @xmath195 the quantities @xmath196 are the bulk one - site height probabilities in the thermodynamic limit , as computed in the previous section , and we normalize the variables @xmath197 to have a zero expectation value in the infinite volume limit . in the scaling limit ,",
    "the variables @xmath197 converge to conformal fields @xmath198 , whose nature has been determined in @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , in view of the calculations of the previous section , the height 1 field is very different from the other height fields .",
    "it was found that @xmath199 is a primary field with conformal weights @xmath16 , while the other three , @xmath200 and @xmath201 , are all related to a single field , identified with the logarithmic partner of @xmath199 .",
    "more precisely , consider the triplet of fields @xmath202 of conformal weights @xmath203 , satisfying the following relations under chiral conformal transformations , @xmath204 and similar relations for antichiral conformal generators ( they however involve a new field @xmath205 with weights ( 1,0 ) ) .",
    "the factor @xmath206 in the first relation in ( [ l0 ] ) is conventional and fixes the relative normalizations of @xmath15 and @xmath17 , unlike the factor @xmath207 in the third relation which is an intrinsic parameter , independent of the field normalizations .",
    "the field @xmath15 is primary , and degenerate at level 2 , whereas , in contrast , @xmath17 has an inhomogeneous transformation under dilations .",
    "in fact , @xmath15 and @xmath17 are members of a non - chiral version of the indecomposable representation called @xmath208 in @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath17 has an inhomogeneous scaling transformation readily implies that correlators containing several @xmath17 s will contain logarithms .    the four height fields @xmath198 have been identified in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath17 in @xcite , based on the calculation of the one - point probabilities @xmath209 on the upper - half plane .",
    "the results are as follows .",
    "the height one and two fields , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are equal to @xmath15 and @xmath17 respectively , while the other two are linear combinations of @xmath15 and @xmath17 , @xmath212 the normalizations of these fields are those of the corresponding lattice random variables .",
    "specifically , the normalization of @xmath15 will be fixed from the lattice calculation of @xmath213 , and in turn fixes that of @xmath17 from the above algebraic relations involves two constants , since if @xmath17 satisfies the algebraic relations , any combination @xmath214 will satisfy them as well .",
    "the normalization of @xmath15 fixes @xmath78 but not @xmath215 .",
    "this freedom is manifest in the correlators ( [ phiphi])-([psipsi ] ) . ] .",
    "the values of the coefficients @xmath216 are then chosen so that @xmath217 and @xmath201 reproduce the normalizations of their lattice counterparts .",
    "evidently the four fields are not independent , but satisfy @xmath218 .",
    "the identification of the height fields makes it possible to compute correlations , and then compare them with lattice calculations . the definition ( [ delta ] ) of the variables @xmath197 makes it obvious that @xmath219 and naturally suggests that the scaling limit of this lattice correlation corresponds to the 2-point function @xmath220 , computed in the conformal theory . a convincing argument that this can not be the case is to notice that @xmath221 , an easy - to - prove and well - known fact in logarithmic conformal theories , would imply @xmath222 in the scaling limit , in contrast to what the explicit calculation yields @xcite .",
    "if @xmath223 denotes the joint probability that the height at @xmath224 be @xmath139 and the height at @xmath225 be @xmath140 , the 2-site correlations are given by @xmath226 for @xmath227 .",
    "in the scaling regime , when the distance @xmath228 is large , these correlations should be equal to expectation values of pairs of fields @xmath229 .",
    "however the plane has no boundary where sand can leave the system , so that the prescription we used earlier requires to insert a bulk dissipation field @xmath230 at infinity .",
    "in fact the correct correspondence states that the scaling limit of the lattice correlation is in terms of a 3-point correlator , @xmath231 = \\la h_a(z,\\bar z ) h_b(w,\\bar w ) \\omega(\\infty ) \\ra,\\ ] ] where @xmath232 is a weight ( 0,0 ) conformal field , logarithmic partner of the identity @xcite .",
    "indeed we have stressed in section [ sec2 ] that , for the dynamics of the model to be well - defined , the finite lattice should include dissipative sites , and that they were all located on the boundary .",
    "since the infinite plane can be thought of as the limit of a sequence of growing finite grids , it means that , in the infinite volume limit , the boundaries , and with them , the dissipation , are sent off to infinity .",
    "the field @xmath230 precisely realizes the insertion of dissipation at infinity @xcite , required for the sandpile model to be well - defined .",
    "the relevant 3-point correlators have been computed in @xcite , and take the form : @xmath233 with @xmath234 .    from these results and the above relation between the height fields and @xmath235",
