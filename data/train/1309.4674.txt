    "in heavy - ion reactions around the coulomb barrier , the relative motion between the projectile and the target nuclei couples to the internal degrees of freedom of the colliding nuclei in a decisive way , leading to a distribution of potential - barrier heights around the energy of the uncoupled coulomb barrier  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the strong enhancements of subbarrier fusion cross sections observed in a number of medium - heavy systems  @xcite , when compared with the predictions of a simple potential model .",
    "the distribution of potential barriers @xmath4 can be obtained from measured fusion cross sections @xmath5 by taking the second derivative @xmath6 with respect to the incident energy  @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the resulting fusion barrier distributions often exhibit structures  @xcite that are characteristic of the details of the collective states to which the entrance channel can couple .",
    "it has been recognized that the concept of a barrier distribution can also be applied to cross sections for heavy - ion , quasi - elastic scattering ( that is , to the sum of elastic and inelastic scattering and transfer cross sections ) @xcite .",
    "for these processes , one can extract the barrier distribution from the measured total differential cross section @xmath8 at backward angles using the simple formula @xmath9 .",
    "notionally , @xmath10 and the rutherford cross section @xmath11 should be taken at a scattering angle @xmath12 , though any large angle may be used with an appropriately defined ` effective ' energy ( see sec .",
    "this quasi - elastic barrier distribution is also sensitive to coupling effects , and behaves in a very similar way to that for fusion  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath13 and @xmath10 are in some sense complementary to one another , in that fusion corresponds to penetration of the potential barrier , whereas back scattering corresponds to reflection from the barrier .    in order to take account of coupling effects in the reaction process",
    ", the coupled - channels method is considered to be a standard approach  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , only a few low - lying collective excitations , such as surface vibrations of spherical nuclei or rotations of nuclei with static deformations , have been taken into account .",
    "these coupled - channels analyses have successfully accounted for the strong enhancement of subbarrier fusion cross sections as well as for the observed structures in the barrier distributions for many systems  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there remain several challenging problems to be explored in the present coupled - channels approach .",
    "for instance , it has been a long - standing problem that a standard value of @xmath14  fm for the surface diffuseness parameter of the real nuclear potential appears too small to account for fusion data , even though this value is required to fit scattering data @xcite .",
    "this problem is also related  @xcite to the deviations of fusion cross sections at deep subbarrier energies from the predictions of standard coupled - channels calculations  @xcite .",
    "another example is quasi - elastic scattering in the @xmath0ne + @xmath1zr systems  @xcite . for these systems ,",
    "the experimental quasi - elastic barrier distributions exhibit significantly different behavior , that is , the barrier distribution for the @xmath0ne + @xmath2zr system shows a much more smeared structure than that for the @xmath0ne + @xmath3zr system .",
    "in contrast , the coupled - channels calculations that include the collective excitations in the @xmath0ne and zr isotopes , yield very similar barrier distributions for the two systems . in the calculations ,",
    "the rotational excitations of the strongly deformed @xmath0ne nucleus dominate the barrier structure , and the collective vibrational excitations in the zr isotopes are found to play a minor role .",
    "experimental data for the total transfer cross section at an energy near the coulomb barrier have been found to be essentially the same  @xcite , and the difference in the barrier distributions has been conjectured to originate from differences in the non - collective excitations in the two zr isotopes .",
    "in fact , since the @xmath2zr nucleus has two neutrons outside the @xmath15 closed shell in @xmath3zr , a larger number of non - collective excited states are present in the spectrum ( for example , the number of known states up to 5  mev is only 35 for @xmath3zr but 87 for @xmath2zr  @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate whether the non - collective excitations of the @xmath1zr isotopes can explain the observed differences in the quasi - elastic barrier distributions for the @xmath0ne + @xmath1zr systems , by explicitly taking them into account in large - scale coupled - channels calculations . in order to describe the non - collective excitations",

    ", we include non - collective states up to 5.7  mev ; this corresponds to 38 levels in @xmath3zr and 75 levels in @xmath2zr .",
    "we have confirmed that the results do not change significantly if the non - collective states are truncated at higher excitation energies .",
    "note that these results have been obtained with a single realization of the coupling matrix elements . in principle one should repeat the calculations many times with randomly generated matrix elements and take an ensemble average .",
    "however , we have verified in a smaller model space that the dispersion due to the randomness of these elements is sufficiently small that a single realization already yields reasonable results .",
    "note also that the excitation energies of the non - collective states are relatively large , so that coupling to them leads to an adiabatic renormalization of the barrier  @xcite .",
    "we have therefore shifted the solid lines in energy by + 0.3 and + 0.6  mev for the @xmath0ne + @xmath3zr and @xmath0ne + @xmath2zr systems , respectively , in order to compensate for this trivial modification of the barrier height .    for the @xmath0ne + @xmath3zr reaction",
    ", one sees that non - collective excitations do not alter the barrier distribution in a significant way , though the dip between the two main peaks is somewhat filled .",
    "in marked contrast , in the @xmath0ne + @xmath2zr reaction , the non - collective excitations almost completely fill this dip , leading to a much more smeared barrier distribution .",
    "furthermore the overall width of the distribution becomes smaller in this case .",
    "these changes all lead to a much more satisfactory agreement with the experimental data .",
    "moreover , we note that the non - collective excitations considerably improve the behavior around @xmath70  mev in both systems . in all these calculations , the same values for the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 of the random - matrix model are used .",
    "therefore , any difference in the non - collective effects originates solely from the different level densities of these zirconium isotopes .",
    "that is , the effect of non - collective excitations is greater for @xmath2zr since a larger number of non - collective states exist in the region of relatively - low excitation energy .",
    "as noted above , this higher level density is due to the two extra neutrons outside the @xmath15 closed neutron shell in @xmath3zr .    our calculations also indicate that the role of noncollective excitations in _ fusion _ barrier distributions is similar to that in the quasi - elastic barrier distributions .",
    "that is , the fusion barrier distribution for the @xmath0ne+@xmath2zr system is significantly altered due to the noncollective excitations , in a similar manner as in the corresponding quasi - elastic barrier distribution shown in fig .",
    "4 , while the fusion barrier distribution for the @xmath0ne+@xmath3zr system is not affected much .",
    "this , of course , is rather expected since there is no reason why the different couplings for the two zr isotopes should not affect the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions in a different way .",
    "this suggests that one can indeed have a smoother fusion barrier distribution for the @xmath0ne+@xmath2zr system as compared to that for the @xmath0ne+@xmath3zr system .",
