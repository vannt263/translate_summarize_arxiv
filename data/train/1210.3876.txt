    "data aggregation @xcite is a key task performed within sensor networks to fuse information from multiple sensors and deliver it to a sink node in a manner that eliminates redundancy and enables energy saving .",
    "the redundancy is a consequence of the correlation inherent in smooth data fields , such as temperature , pressure , and sound measurements , in practical applications that include surveillance and habitat monitoring .",
    "suppose a sensor transfers its single measurement to the sink over @xmath0 intermediate sensors along a routing path .",
    "each intermediate sensor combines the data it receives with its own data and forwards it along the route .",
    "this data aggregation process usually involves @xmath1 data transmission .",
    "however when there is redundancy in data then it lends itself to sparse representations and in - network compression thereby yielding energy savings in the information transfer .",
    "recently the use of compressive data gathering has been examined  @xcite , and shown to reduce transmission requirements to @xmath2 , where m represents the number of random measurements , and @xmath3 .",
    "if we ignore temporal change and only consider data in a certain time snapshot , then each sensor only has one measurement . according to compressive sensing ( cs ) theory @xcite",
    ", the compressive data gathering ( cdg ) method @xcite requires all the sensors to collectively provide at the sink at least @xmath4 measurements to fully recover the signal , where @xmath5 is the sparsity of signal .",
    "we note that when the cdg method is applied in a large scale network , @xmath6 may still be a large number .",
    "moreover in the initial data aggregation phase in @xcite , leaf nodes unnecessarily transmit @xmath6 measurements , which is in excess of their sensed data and therefore introduces redundancy in data aggregation . recognizing this , the hybrid cs aggregation@xcite@xcite method proposed an amalgam of the merits of non - cs aggregation and plain cs aggregation .",
    "it optimized the data aggregation cost by setting a threshold @xmath6 and applying cs aggregation when data gathered in a sensor equals or exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "the data transmission cost and hence the energy consumption is reduced .",
    "however , we observe that only a small fraction of sensors utilize cs aggregation method and the transmission measurement number @xmath7 for those nodes using cs aggregation method is still large .",
    "our work here shows significant improvement is possible and it stems from a hierarchical clustering architecture that we propose .",
    "the central idea is to configure sensor nodes such that instead of one sink node being targeted by all sensors , several nodes are designated for intermediate data collection and concatenated to yield a hierarchy of clusters at different levels .",
    "the use of the hierarchical architecture reduces the measurement number in the algorithm  @xcite@xcite for cs aggregation since in the new architecture it is based on the cluster size rather than the global sensor network size @xmath8 . in this paper , we propose a novel cs - based data aggregation hierarchical architecture over the sensor network and investigate its performance in terms of data rate and energy savings . to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to investigate compressive sensing method for hierarchical data aggregation in sensor network .",
    "we refer to our method as hierarchical data aggregation using compressive sensing ( hdacs ) .",
    "the proposed data aggregation architecture distributes the workload of one sink to all the sensors , which is crucial for balancing energy consumption over the whole network . in this paper",
    "we also perform a theoretical analysis of the data transmission requirements and energy consumption in hdacs .",
    "we implement our proposed architecture on a sidnet - swans simulation platform and test different sizes of two - dimensional randomly deployed sensor network .",
    "the results validate our theoretical analysis .",
    "substantial energy savings are reported for a large portion of sensors on the different hierarchical positions , ranging from 50% to 77% when compared with  @xcite , and from 37% to 70% when compared with @xcite @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind this new architecture is that all sensors will no longer aim at flowing their data into one sink . instead",
    ", plenty of collecting clusters have been concatenated forming different types of clusters in different levels .",
    "the data flows from the source node through the architecture to the sink .",
    "suppose n sensors have been uniformly and randomly deployed in a 2d square space with area s. let @xmath9 be the unit area in the lowest level and the clusters have been defined in a multi - resolution way with highest level t. in each level @xmath10 , we define :    * @xmath11 : the area of @xmath12 cluster * @xmath13 : the @xmath12 cluster head in the network * @xmath14 : the number of sensors in one cluster * @xmath15 : the transmission number of measurements for @xmath12 cluster * @xmath16 : the sum of distances between cluster head @xmath17 and its children nodes . * @xmath18 : the ratio of transmitting data size and receiving data size .",

    "total transmission measurements @xmath22 is @xmath25 and total energy cost @xmath23 is @xmath26 .          in order to simplify the model analysis and get quantitative comparisons with previous work",
    ", we put some constraints on our cs data aggregation architecture .",
    "figure [ dataaggarc ] shows the logical tree of clustering configuration , which consists of identical @xmath27 nodes in level i for @xmath28 and random leaf nodes @xmath29 . consider a n nodes network , where @xmath30",
    "therefore , we have the following formula : @xmath31 besides , in level @xmath10 , @xmath16 is the sum of distances between cluster head @xmath17 and its children cluster heads @xmath32 in the level i-1 .",
    "the number of cluster heads is @xmath33 .",
    "the area of @xmath12 cluster @xmath11 will be the same as that of all the other clusters at that level .",
    "we denote them as @xmath34 which combines @xmath27 subregions from i-1 level , and it satisfies the relation of @xmath35 .",
    "we distribute the sensors in a 2d randomly deployed network with some constraints .",
    "* there will be at least n nodes in each cluster in level 1 .",
    "this property requires we have to maximize the probability of n nodes in one cluster : @xmath36 it requires to minimize @xmath37 . from historical experiences , we are prone to set up @xmath38 to guarantee the full coverage of the whole region for each clusters with square area without producing intersections between two neighboring clusters . therefore , @xmath39 . and",
    "we get the minimum of @xmath37 . *",
    "the remaining sensors are uniformly and randomly distributed in @xmath40 clusters .",
    "so we set to maximize the probability of of @xmath41 nodes in @xmath40 clusters .",
    "@xmath42 this has already been achieved in the constrains ( [ p1 ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of this network deployment is that it is based on 2d randomly deployed network topology , which corresponds to practical sensors distribution .",
    "it also addresses issues when the the condition that @xmath43 is not met . besides",
    ", the number of cluster heads will be at most @xmath44 , and the leaf nodes will be @xmath45 . if @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "this result implies that only a small number of nodes will be involved with multiple level data processing and aggregation .",
    "the only job of other sensors is just sending their data directly to the cluster head . the balance in load distribution",
    "is achieved by randomly choosing different cluster heads in each duty circle .      in the initial phase ,",
    "@xmath48 sensors in each region only send their raw data to their cluster head @xmath49 , which adopts the same strategy as paper @xcite @xcite so as to reduce cs data aggregation redundancy .",
    "@xmath49 compressed them into @xmath50 random measurements .",
    "in level i ( @xmath51 ) , the @xmath12 cluster head @xmath13 receives @xmath52 random measurements , where @xmath53 $ ] from its children cluster head @xmath54 .",
    "it performs cs recovery algorithm to reconstruct the redundant data . after accumulating all the data from their children nodes",
    ", the cluster head takes @xmath15 random measurements of the signal and send them to its parent cluster head in the level i+1 . according to compressive sensing theory , for signal with sparsity k , the random measurements @xmath55 will be enough to fully represent original signal with cardinality n. we adopt the method in @xcite @xcite to set up threshold @xmath56 to optimize the data transmission size .",
    "we propose to set up multiple thresholds @xmath57 with upper bound @xmath55 in the top level t. @xmath22 is a small number when i is small .",
    "this property helps to reduce the data transmission number and hence significantly save energy .      for @xmath58",
    ", we get @xmath59 and measurements @xmath15 in the range of @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "the total transmission measurements @xmath6 for the whole data aggregation task is : @xmath61 let @xmath62 and and @xmath63we get the closed form of @xmath64 : @xmath65 and @xmath66 therefore , the lower bound of data transmission number m is : @xmath67 and upper bound is @xmath68 on the other hand if data is sent using the same data architecture , the total measurements with the plain or non - hybrid cs ( ncs ) algorithm in paper @xcite is : @xmath69 . in paper @xcite @xcite , the total measurements for hybrid cs ( hcs )",
    "algorithm is : @xmath70 . in the following analysis",
    ", we assume the sparsity k as unity to rule out the effects from data field for data aggregation comparison .",
    "figure [ meacom ] shows the quantitative comparison of total data transmission measurements with cluster size n = 4 , 16 , 64 for proposed hdacs method , ncs data aggregation @xcite and hcs method @xcite @xcite with 1024 sensor nodes . from figure",
    "[ meacom ] , we find the bigger the cluster size is , the less measurements needed for data transmission .",
    "however , this theoretical analysis does not consider the realistic routing protocol underlying the network architecture in the lower layer",
    ". simply expanding the cluster size within local cluster and all the nodes forward their sensed data into cluster head directly , which definitely will lead to severe data flooding and data loss .",
    "therefore , cluster size will be fixed as 4 and 16 in the following analysis .",
    "figure [ diffsize ] shows total data transmission measurements changes with increase of sensor nodes under these two fixed cluster sizes . from the figure",
    ", we observe that the ncs method introduces a large number of data redundancy .",
    "the measurements required by hcs method is a little worse than proposed method , but we need to point out that this comparison is based on the premise that the data is propagated on the muli - resolution data architecture . since a lot of sensors are leaf nodes and only transmit their raw data to their cluster heads both in the proposed method in this paper and hcs method @xcite@xcite in the first level , they lead to very similar result in the theoretical analysis .",
    "the data compression ratio @xmath71 is calculated as follows : @xmath72",
    "+    compression ratio resides in the range of : @xmath73 , \\text{if } i\\geq 2 $ ] .",
    "figure [ cr ] shows the compression ratio changes in each level for ncs method , hcs method , and proposed hdacs method with cluster size 4 and 16 .",
    "the figure shows that the ncs method provides no compression at all .",
    "hcs method yields compression in the first level by using compressive sensing method to compress data when the number of data reaches the global threshold .",
    "the proposed hierarchy based method achieves a remarkable compression ratio for each level which is well below 0.5 .",
    "this is very appealing as nodes that are spatially close to the central sink working as intermediate nodes usually consume more energy than other nodes .",
    "the energy savings in the task in the application layer for those nodes will balance the energy consumed in the routing layer , which therefore prolongs the lifetime of the network .    for the energy analysis , we pay more attention to the data transmission cost and the cost of receiving data is taken as a constant .",
    "transmission energy cost @xmath19 is usually a function of transmission distance @xmath16 and data size @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 has been modeled as @xmath74 , which leads to the total transmission energy cost in each level @xmath26 . here , @xmath75 is a constant startup energy consumption for each data transmission task , and @xmath76 is a constant transmission cost for unit data size per unit distance .",

    "the proposed hdacs method achieves the highest efficiency in energy consumption compared with other methods . in the following paper",
    ", we set up 2d irregular network deployments on java - based sidnet - swans simulation platform to demonstrate feasibility and robustness of our hierarchy model .        a variety of practical applications in survelillance and habitat monitoring , the data fields such as temperature , sound , pressure measurements are usually smooth .",
    "in this paper we ignore the effect of variation of sparsity k in each level .",
    "therefore , smooth data field with uniform noise is a practical choice to get the sparse signal representation with identical sparsity k. we perform discrete cosine transform ( dct ) for each of the collecting clusters before taking random measurements .",
    "the main reasons for choosing dct are : a ) .",
    "it yields fast vanishing moments of signal representation and gives real coefficients unlike discrete fourier transform ( dft ) .",
    "it also does not require that cardinality of measurements be a power of 2 as wavelet transform does .",
    "we perform the truncating process for dct coefficients by forcing those magnitudes below a threshold to zero in order to further sparsify the signals .",
    "the threshold has been set up by @xmath98 percentile of the first dominant magnitudes . in actual simulation , @xmath98 is chosen as 0.01 , 0.005 .",
    "the multi - scale routing protocol matches well with hierarchical data aggregation mechanism .",
    "since our model mainly focuses on the dense and large - scale network topology , it guarantees the existence of shortest path between any two nodes .",
    "cosamp algorithm @xcite has been adopted as the cs recovery algorithm in our implementation .",
    "this algorithm takes @xmath99 as a proxy to represent signal inspired by the restricted isometry property of compressive sensing .",
    "compared with other recovery methods such as various versions of omp@xcite@xcite algorithms , convex programming methods@xcite@xcite , combinatorial algorithms@xcite@xcite , cosamp algorithm guarantees computation speed and provides rigorous error bounds .",

    "the performance has been evaluated on sidnet - swans platform with jist system to demonstrate all the theoretical analysis process .",
    "the algorithms was tested against five network sizes : 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , and 700 nodes over a flat data field with uniformly distributed additive white noise . in all these network",
    ", we choose @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the leaf nodes number @xmath102 in the level one is flexible , which fits the characteristics of two - dimensional random deployment of sensor networks .",
    "therefore , @xmath103 . in the recovery procedure",
    ", we adopt the idea of model - based cosamp @xcite algorithm as the dct representation makes the support location of coefficients visible and design a new cosamp algorithm for dct based signal ensemble , which accurately recovers the data .",
    "we define the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) as the logarithm of the ratio of signal power from each sensors over recovery error in the fusion center . as we see from figure [ snr ]",
    ", the change of sensor size does not affect snr performance .",
    "figure [ er ] shows the comparison of transmission energy consumption distribution for 400 sensor networks .",
    "ratio1 is defined as transmission energy consumption ratio of proposed hdacs and ncs data aggregation .",
    "ratio2 is defined as transmission energy consumption ratio of proposed hdacs and hcs data aggregation .",
    "as we see from the figure [ er ] , ratio1 is less than 0.5 , which means 50% transmission energy will be saved compared with ncs data aggregation .",
    "ratio2 is almost equal or less than 1 , which is owing to the fact that most nodes only transmit data in the level one and finish their job .",
    "both proposed hdacs and hcs data aggregation adopt the same strategy that only raw data is transmitted for those leaf nodes , which explains why most ratio2 values of nodes are equal to one .",
    "but for those nodes working as collecting clusters in the levels that are higher than one , ratio2 values are less or equal to 0.633 as we expect . the nodes with highest level",
    "save almost 70% power .",
    "moreover , the results we obtain so far depend on the frame size per transmission in mac layer to some extent . if the data size becomes larger , data will be segmented into more frames for transmission . and this will definitely cost more power . since the comparison of proposed hdacs , ncs and hcs algorithms always refers to compare the number of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    "when @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , frame number are 1 and 2 respectively , which explains how 50% transmission energy is saved by using hdacs data aggregation .",
    "in this paper , we presented a novel power - efficient hierarchical data aggregation architecture using compressive sensing for a large scale dense sensor network .",
