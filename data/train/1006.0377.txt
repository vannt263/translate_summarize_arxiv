    "nulling is considered an important clue towards unraveling the mystery of the pulsar emission mechanism .",
    "detailed investigation of nulling for many pulsars in several works ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , has established that nulling is intrinsic to individual pulsars and possibly broadband in radio frequency . though nulling is known to occur randomly , there are some recent studies by @xcite and @xcite which report periodicity in nulling for quite a few pulsars .",
    "it is generally believed that onset of nulling is abrupt , i.e. pulse intensity drops suddenly at the onset of a null . however , for psr b0809@xmath374 and psr b1944@xmath317 , it is reported that the transitions from bursts to nulls show a gradual decline of pulse energy , while transitions from nulls to bursts are abrupt ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , for psr b0031@xmath007",
    ", the onset of nulls is found to be abrupt @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the pre and post null behavior of psr b0809@xmath374 and reported a relative dimness of the last few pulses before nulls , whereas the first active pulse at the onset of the burst ( after each null ) appears to outshine the normal pulses .",
    "@xcite confirmed their results and also investigated the interaction between drifting and nulling    in psr b0809@xmath374 .",
    "they concluded that the drift pattern immediately after the nulls differs from the normal one and commented that , beside its normal and most common mode , the pulsar emits in a significantly different quasi - stable mode immediately after most , or possibly all , the nulls . in this mode",
    "the pulsar is brighter and the subpulse separation is less .",
    "they also reported that the subpulses drift more slowly and the pulse window is shifted towards the earlier longitudes .",
    "investigating the interaction between drifting and nulling , @xcite determined the alias order for drifting of psr b0818@xmath013 .    though there has been significant progress both in the field of observations as well as understanding and characterising the phenomenon of nulling",

    "we find simultaneous occurrence of three drift regions with two different drift rates : an inner region with steeper apparent drift rate , flanked on each side by a region of slower apparent drift rate .",
    "the closely spaced drift bands always maintain a constant phase relationship : the subpulse emission from the inner drift region is in phase with that from the outer drift region on the right hand side , and at the same time the emission in the inner drift region is out of phase with the outer drift region situated on the left hand side .",
    "this phase locked relationship is maintained for the entire stretch of the data ( for all the epochs of observations at 325 and 610 mhz ) and does not appear to get perturbed after intermittent nulling or during changes in the drift rates . although an extensive study of subpulse drifting and polarization properties of this pulsar is presented in @xcite , its nulling properties remain hitherto unexplored . this paper reports a detailed investigation of the behaviour of this pulsar around nulls , from observations at 325 and 610 mhz .",

    "we can not estimate meaningful values from the 610 mhz data , as the on and off distributions overlap significantly at this frequency , but the nulling fraction at 610 mhz seems to be consistent with the 325 mhz data .",
    "although pulse energy distributions provide statistical information about the nulling phenomenon , identifying individual nulls at each frequency is required for more detailed investigation .",
    "this is done by comparing the on pulse energy estimate with a threshold based on the system noise level .",
    "the uncertainty in the pulse energy estimate @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of on pulse bins and @xmath8 is the rms of the off pulse region .",

    "we infer that the entire pulse energy appears to change in a fairly particular manner immediately before and after the nulls , though the variations are more clear for the inner region of the pulse .",

    "this is a reflection of the fact that in case of inner region our line of sight is grazing the emission ring , whereas for the leading and trailing outer regions we have a more central or direct traverse ( see fig . 7 and fig .",

    "such systematic intensity modulations may be partially masked by modulations due to other causes such as drifting subpulses , as we find for the outer regions of psr b0818@xmath041 .",
    "for the inner region , where the grazing line of sight samples a larger portion of the emission region , subpulses from multiple drift bands are averaged and as a result , intensity modulations due to these are smoothed out .",
    "this warrants a more detailed study of the intensity modulations around nulls for other pulsars .",
    "we have reported significant evolution of the shapes of the pulses around the nulls , especially at the beginning of the bursts .",
    "shape changes of the first few pulses in the bursts include the enhanced bump of intensity in the inner region , a more symmetric profile with the ratio of strengths of the leading and trailing components becoming close to unity .",
    "this is accompanied by an increase of about 10% in the width of the profile , as well as a shift of the mid - point towards the trailing side .",
    "such effects are seen in some other pulsars also .",
    "@xcite reported significantly different shapes of the average profiles from pulses before and after the nulls for psr b0818@xmath013 @xmath0 the average profile from the last and first active pulses immediately before and after the nulls are observed to be double peaked , whereas the normal average profile are observed to be single peaked . for psr b1944@xmath317",
    ", @xcite reported that the last pulse before null has a shape that is quantitatively different and more variable than the shapes of other pulses . for psr b0809@xmath374",
    ", @xcite found that though the pulses immediately before and after the nulls are similar in shape to the average profile , the peak of average profile from the first active pulse in the bursts after nulls is shifted towards earlier pulse longitude .",
    "as an explanation for this , @xcite proposed that after the nulls sub - beam carousel is smaller , indicating that we are looking deeper in the pulsar magnetosphere than we do normally .",
    "finally , as an exception , we mention the case of psr b0031@xmath007 , for which @xcite did not find any significant difference in the average profiles from the first active pulse in bursts , the last active pulse before the nulls , and the normal average profile .    for psr b0818@xmath041 , the change in pulse width and center of the profile that is reported by us can be interpreted as a change in the distribution of the emission regions in the pulsar s magnetosphere .",
    "the pulse width can increase if either the cone of emission originates from a higher altitude on the same set of field lines , or if it shifts to outer field lines while maintaining a constant altitude .",
    "a combination of both these effects is also possible .",
    "if a increase in height alone was responsible , then the mid - point should have moved to earlier longitudes , due to increased aberration and retardation effects @xcite .",
    "if a change of field line alone was responsible , then the mid - point should have remained at the same longitude .",
    "the observed behaviour appears to require a combination of a shift to more outer field lines along with a reduction in the emission height .",
    "the shift to an outer set of field lines needs to be such that it produces an increase in the pulse width which is somewhat larger than observed .",
    "some of this increase would then be compensated by the reduced height of emission , which should also be enough to produce the observed shift of the mid - point to later longitudes .",
    "the above picture becomes even more interesting when we add the information about the changing drift rates just before and after the nulls .",
    "it appears that as the pulsar s radio intensity dims gradually before the nulls , there is often an accompanying reduction in the drift rate .",
    "further , when the pulsar comes out of the nulls , the increased radio intensity for the first few pulses is very often accompanied by what looks like a disturbed drift rate behaviour , which settles down to the regular drift pattern as the pulsar intensity returns to normal .",
    "this correspondence of intensity behaviour with drift rate variations , though not indisputably strong , is nevertheless quite striking and suggests a common cause .",
    "one such possibility is explored in the next section .",
    "what is known about this kind of property for other pulsars ?",
    "investigating drifting around the null for psr b0809@xmath374 , @xcite , found that drift rate just before a null does not deviate from the normal drift rate .",
    "however , drift rate just after nulls is different from the normal drift rate .",
    "after the nulls psr b0809@xmath374 goes to a quasi - stable mode .",
    "they also found that drift rates after longer nulls are lower than the normal average drift rate .    from the discussions in sect .",
    "[ intensity_around_nulls ] , [ shape_width_around_nulls ] and [ drift_around_nulls ] , it is clear that there are some very specific and well correlated changes that are seen in the radio emission properties of psr b0818@xmath041 when it restarts emission after a null .",
    "the fact that these changes are seen to be quite similar on two different epochs of observations strongly supports that these are stable , intrinsic changes and are tightly coupled to the nulling process .",
    "this points strongly to a scenario where the electromagnetic conditions in the region of the magnetosphere responsible for the radio emission reach a well defined `` state '' during or towards the end of each null ; in other words , some kind of a `` reset '' of the pulsar s radio emission engine takes place , as a result of which the pulsar starts with a very characteristic post - null behaviour that slowly evolves towards a different kind of behaviour which characterises the average properties of the pulsar . just before the onset of null , though the behaviour is fairly characteristic , it is not as stable or repeatable as that just after the nulls . in the following",
    "we explain some of these results with partially screened gap model .      according to the widely accepted picture ,",
    "each radio subpulse can be associated with a radio sub beam passing through our line of sight , which is emitted at some altitude ( canonically about 50@xmath0100 stellar radii ) within a plasma column that is directly related to a spark discharge within the inner acceleration region near the polar cap surface .",
    "the spark discharge produces a goldreich julian density of the primary ( highly relativistic ) column of plasma , which is then sturrock multiplied and formed into a column of very dense but much less relativistic secondary plasma .",
    "complicated non - linear processes in these plasma lead to the generation of the coherent radio emission associated with the observed subpulse ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is no clear picture about how the energy density is propagating from the spark to the unstable secondary plasma and then to the radio emission beam .",
    "however , one can assume that the stronger the electric field in the acceleration region the stronger is the radio intensity of the observed subpulses .",
    "the prototype of the inner acceleration region was the pure vacuum gap model of @xcite .",
    "it is now understood that this model predicts too fast a subpulse drift since the electric field in pure vacuum gap is too strong .",
    "much better agreement with the observational data of drifting subpulses is achieved within the so - called partially screened gap model ( hereafter psg ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) , in which the electric field is screened and lowered by factor of about 10 due to thermal emission of iron ions from the hot polar cap surface .",
    "the polar cap is heated due to the reverse flow of electrons from the magnetically created electron - positron pairs , even as the accelerated positrons leave the acceleration region .",
    "the heating produces thermal ejection of ions from the surface , which partially screens the gap electric field .",
    "the psg model postulates that the polar cap temperature , @xmath28 , reaches a quasi - equilibrium value , slightly below the critical ion temperature , @xmath29 .",
    "this quasi - equilibrium is established by a subtle thermostatic balance between the heating due to back - flow bombardment and cooling due to radiation : the higher the @xmath30 , the larger the thermo - emission of positive ions , which screens the potential drop in the gap , reduces the acceleration of the charges , thereby reducing the heating effect and thus leads to a decrease in the temperature ( see @xcite for details ) . in the equilibrium condition ,",
    "the value of @xmath30 is about few percent lower than @xmath31 ( which is about @xmath32 k ) , whereas the potential drop is only a few percent of the vacuum gap value ( see appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "it is quite likely that the actual surface temperature @xmath28 varies slightly around a thermostatically determined value on relatively slow time scales of longer than pulsar period .",
    "these tiny variations with an amplitude of few thousands k can be crucial for the pulse nulling phenomenon .",
    "we speculate that a null occurs when the polar cap temperature raises by few thousands k to a value at which the potential drop is screened to a level making generation of detectable radio emission impossible . in this phase",
    "the remnant potential drop can still drive enough pair production to heat the polar cap surface but not enough to generate detectable radio emission higher up in the magnetosphere .",
    "this residual heating is very important and its actual amount will determine the time of null duration . without a residual heating",
    "the nulls would be extremely short ( below 100 ns ; @xcite ) and unnoticeable .",
    "after some time the radiation cooling prevails and the temperature drops back few thousands k to the psg thermostatic regime .",
    "the pulsar is back in the normal emission mode .",
    "most likely , before reaching the quasi - stationary value the epoch of even lower temperatures will be reached , when the potential drop is even higher and the drift is fast , aliased and chaotic .    the electric field in the inner acceleration region above the polar cap results from deviations of the actual charge density from the co - rotational goldreich - julian ( 1969 ) value .",
    "this `` non - co - rotational field '' has two natural components : parallel and perpendicular to the surface magnetic field b. the parallel component causes acceleration , and in consequence pair plasma production which is utilized in the radio emission generation process further away .",
    "also the heating of the polar cap surface , including thermal ions ejection , are due to this parallel component .",
    "second component is tangent to the surface of the polar cap .",
    "this component causes the spark plasma circulation around the polar cap and in consequence subpulse drift across the pulse window .",
    "it is obvious that any variation of the gap electric field concerns both components .",
    "therefore , the decrease / increase of the subpulse intensity should be correlated with slowing down / speeding up of the ( non - aliased ) subpulse drifting . in other words ,",
    "the gradual decrease of subpulse intensity observed just before a null should be associated with the gradual slowdown of the subpulse drift .",
    "exactly such a correlation is reported in our paper and its explanation ( at least qualitative ) seems clear .",
    "just before a null the gap electric field decreases gradually on the time scales of several to few tens of pulsar periods , which causes a gradual drop of both the subpulse intensity and their drift rate .",
    "we speculate that this gradual decrease of gap electric field is caused by a small increase of the surface temperature which is estimated later in this section .",
    "after the nulls the intensity rises to maximum over a short ( less than one period ) time scale , keeping a high intensity for a number of pulses ( often randomly scattered over the pulse window ) . then the normal drifting mode begins , with intensity slightly lower than those just after the nulls .",
    "this behaviour suggests strongly that at some point during a null the electric field begins to rise again and as soon as it reaches a critical value the psg resumes an operation and the pulsar is back in action .",
    "again , one can speculate that this rise of the electric field is associated with a small drop of the surface temperature . right after the null",
    "the electric field is probably stronger than in the stable normal drifting mode .",
    "this is why the subpulses after a null are initially stronger than in the normal mode .",
    "we believe that under this strong electric field the spark circulation is very fast but also slowing down quickly as the electric field decreases .",
    "the system goes through fast variations of carousel circulation speed , which may result in the erratic behaviour of the observed subpulses . later , after few to several pulses the psg reaches the stable state and resumes normal operation .",
    "the pulsar is back in the normal drifting mode .    using the phase offset between the leading and the trailing outer regions",
    ", we found that subpulse drifting in psr b0818@xmath041 is most likely first order aliased @xcite . the carousel rotation period @xmath33 18.3 @xmath34 and time interval between recurrence of successive drift bands at a given pulse longitude @xmath35=0.95 @xmath2 . the observed slowing down of the drift rate to the point of phase stationary apparent drift bands just before the nulls ( discussed in sect .",
    "[ drift_around_null_1 ] ) means that @xmath35 is close to @xmath2 .",
    "hence , just before the nulls @xmath35 must increase by about 5% ( from 0.95 to about 1.0 ) .",
    "this small variation of drift rate could be due to small change in the neutron star s surface temperature @xcite . in the following we estimate required change in polar cap temperature to increase @xmath35 by 5% . within the psg model",
    "the actual potential drop is set at the level of few percent of the maximum possible @xcite value , i.e. @xmath36 , where the screening factor @xmath37 $ ] and the coefficient @xmath38 depends on the chemical composition of the surface layer ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the carousel scenario of the subpulse drift based on the psg model @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the polar cap radius",
    ", @xmath41 is the height of the acceleration region and @xmath42 is the number of sparks circulating around the polar cap .",
    "thus , the basic drifting periodicity @xmath43 .",
    "assuming that ion critical temperature @xmath44 k ( which seems to be a typical value ; @xcite ) , for change of @xmath35 from 0.95 to 1.0 ; the screening factor @xmath45 must change from 0.335 to 0.318 and hence the corresponding ratios @xmath46 , will be equal to 0.98658 and 0.9874 , respectively .",
    "the required change in the surface temperature is @xmath47 k ( from 1.973 to 1.9748 mk ) .",
    "so , to explain 5% slow - down of drift in b0818@xmath041 just before the onset of the nulls , one would have to invoke about 0.1 % polar cap surface temperature variation .",
    "based on the psg model @xcite argued ( see their section 4.4 ) that only about 0.14 % change in the surface polar cap temperature ( i.e. a change of about 4000 k around 2@xmath48 k average temperature ) is needed to cause this 8 % slow - down of drift signatures in b0826@xmath034 ; which is of the same ballpark to our estimation for b0818@xmath041 .    based on the frequency evolution of average profile , the observed pa swing and the analysis of subpulse drift signatures we proposed two possible geometries for this pulsar , * g-1 * ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , and * g-2 * ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) in @xcite .",
    "pulsar radiation pattern simulated with both the geometries reproduces the observed features , except for some differences .",
    "although * g-2 * provides a reasonable fit to the overall pa curve at 325 mhz , and the left half of the pa curve at 610 mhz , only the middle part of the pa curve at 610 mhz can be fitted with *",
    "g-1*. on the other hand * g-1 * appears to give better match on the observed @xmath53 ( longitude separation between the drift bands ) values and the over all drift pattern .",
    "both the geometries can explain the slight changes of apparent drift rates and phase stationary drift bands , once aliasing of drifting subpulses is considered .",
    "the observed slow down of apparent drift rate before nulling can be interpreted as slowing down of the carousel in * g-1 * and speeding up of the carousel in * g-2 * ( see sect .",
    "7.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , within the psg model the accelerating gap electric field must increase to cause the speed up of the sparking carousel ; and electric field should decrease to cause the slow - down of the same .",
    "a correlation between the gradual slowdown of the drift rate and gradual decrease of pulse energy is expected within the inner gap acceleration model .",
    "hence , the fact that we do observe the gradual intensity decrease over a number of pulses just before the nulls strongly suggests that the accelerating electric field decreases in this stage of pulsar activity .",
    "this automatically implies that the carousel slows - down before the nulls , which is the case for * g-1*. thus comparison of the prediction of psg model with observations favors * g-1 * over * g-2*.",
    "following are the interesting new results from our investigation of the nulling properties of psr b0818@xmath041 .",
    "the results presented in this paper indicates that phenomenon of nulling is intrinsic to the pulsar radio emission that is systematically ceased during the nulls .",
    "this study will put constraint on the models explaining pulsar radio emission and nulling .",
    "we successfully explained many of our results with the help of psg model .",
    "however , some remains to be explained , for example , why nulling is associated with fast rise and slow fall of intensity , why intensity distribution across the profile immediately after the nulls is different than typical .",
    "more importantly , how the gap electric field varies around the nulls and what could actually cause a radio null , remains to be explained .",
    "considering the psg model , the actual mechanism of generation of the coherent radio emission must be very sensitive to tiny changes of the input parameters .",
    "we intend to devote a separate paper to this and the other problems mentioned above .",
    "clearly , investigations of the pre and post null emission properties of psr b0818@xmath041 , presented in this paper , emphasize that nulling provides an useful tool to probe the pulsar radio emission .",
    "though , there is some evidence in general pulsar population for the kind of behaviour that we report for psr b0818@xmath041 , for some pulsars such systematic modulations may be partially masked by modulations due to other causes such as drifting subpulses .",
