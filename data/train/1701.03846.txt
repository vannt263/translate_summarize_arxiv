    "the theory of graph limits offers analytic tools to represent and analyze large graphs ; for an introduction to this area , we refer the reader to a recent monograph by lovsz  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the theory also generated new tools and perspectives on many problems in mathematics and computer science .",
    "for example , the flag algebra method of razborov  @xcite , which bears close connections to convergent sequences of dense graphs , catalysed progress on many important problems in extremal combinatorics , e.g.  @xcite . in relation to computer science ,",
    "the theory of graph limits shed new light on property and parameter testing algorithms  @xcite .",
    "central to dense graph convergence is the analytic representation of the limit of a convergent sequence of dense graphs , known as a _ graphon _",
    "@xcite ; we formally define this notion and other related notions in section  [ sec - defs ] .",
    "we are interested in graphons that are uniquely determined ( up to isomorphism ) by finitely many graph densities , which are called _ finitely forcible _ graphons . such graphons are related to various problems from extremal graph theory and from graph theory in general .",
    "for example , for every finitely forcible graphon @xmath0 , there exists a linear combination of graph densities such that the graphon @xmath0 is its unique minimizer .",
    "another example is the characterization of quasirandom graphs in terms of graph densities by thomason  @xcite which is essentially equivalent to stating that the constant graphon is finitely forcible by densities of @xmath1-vertex graphs ; also see  @xcite for further results on quasirandom graphs .",
    "lovsz and ss  @xcite generalized this characterization by showing that every step graphon , a multipartite graphon with quasirandom edge densities between its parts , is finitely forcible . other examples of finitely forcible graphons are given in  @xcite .",
    "early examples of finitely forcible graphons indicated that all finitely forcible graphons might posses a simple structure , as formalized by lovsz and szegedy , who conjectured the following  ( * ? ? ? * conjectures  9 and 10 ) .",
    "[ conj - compact ] the space of typical vertices of every finitely forcible graphon is compact .",
    "[ conj - dimension ] the space of typical vertices of every finitely forcible graphon has a finite dimension .",
    "both conjectures were disproved through counterexample constructions  @xcite . a stronger counterexample to conjecture  [ conj - dimension ]",
    "was found in  @xcite : conjecture  [ conj - dimension ] would imply that the number of parts of a weak @xmath2-regular partition of a finitely forcible graphon is bounded by a polynomial of @xmath3 but the construction given in  @xcite almost matches the best possible exponential lower bound from  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a general method for constructing complex finitely forcible graphons , which would include , as specific cases , the earlier ad hoc constructions from  @xcite . to this end , we will define a notion of computability of graphons . while there are numerous ways to define such a notion , we choose one of the weakest ( to obtain the strongest possible result ) : we will require that the density of the graphon between any pairs of its parts can be approximated within an arbitrary precision by a turing machine , without constraining time or space needed for the computation .",
    "such graphons able to be computed in this way will be called _ recursive graphons _ ; a formal definition can be found in subsection  [ sec - recursive ] .",
    "our main result reads as follows .",
    "[ thm - main ] for every recursive graphon @xmath4 , there exists a finitely forcible graphon @xmath5 such that @xmath4 is a subgraphon of @xmath5 , and the subgraphon is formed by a @xmath6 fraction of the vertices of @xmath5 .",
    "since every finitely forcible graphon is the unique minimizer of some linear combination of densities of subgraphs , theorem  [ thm - main ] shows that optimal solutions of problems seeking to minimize a linear combination of densities of subgraphs , which are among the simplest stated problems in extremal graph theory , may have unique optimal solutions with highly complex structure .",
    "in addition , since the class of recursive graphons includes graphons with the space of typical vertices possessing properties described in conjectures  [ conj - compact ] and  [ conj - dimension ] , theorem  [ thm - main ] immediately implies that both conjectures presented above are false .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the following generalization of the construction from  @xcite ( we give further details in section  [ sec - concl ] ) :    [ cor - main ] for every recursive non - decreasing function @xmath7 tending to infinity , there exist a finitely forcible graphon @xmath0 and positive reals @xmath8 tending to @xmath9 such that every weak @xmath8-regular partition of @xmath0 has at least @xmath10 parts .    since every graphon has weak @xmath2-regular partitions with @xmath11 parts , corollary  [ cor - main ] gives the best possible dependance on @xmath3 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm - main ] builds on the methods introduced in  @xcite , which were further developed and formalized in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the proof uses the technique of decorated constraints , which we present in subsection  [ sec - constraints ] .",
    "the general idea of the proof involves constructing an auxiliary structure within a graphon to enable the simulation of turing machine computations describing the graphon @xmath4 .",
    "the outputs of these simulations will restrict the density of the graphon in its various parts , rendering it unique up to a set of measure zero ( in a way analogous to that used in  @xcite ) . while this approach seems uncomplicated upon first glance",
    ", the proof hides a variety of ideas and technical details related to setting up the grids for simulating the computations of the turing machine , collecting their outputs before eventually forcing the graphon @xmath4 itself in a part of the graphon @xmath5 .",
    "the reward is a result enabling the embedding of very complex graphons in finitely forcible graphons with virtually no additional effort .",
    "we devote this section to introducing notation used throughout the paper .",
    "let us start with some basic general notation .",
