    "in the following we will consider relativistic and non - relativistic particles with mass @xmath0 , charge @xmath1 and spin 1/2 in external static electromagnetic fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the relativistic case",
    "the quantum dynamics are generated by a dirac - hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are hermitian @xmath7 matrices satisfying the algebraic relations @xmath8 . in dirac representation",
    "they read @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the pauli matrices and @xmath11 is a @xmath12 unit matrix .",
    "as it is well known , in leading non - relativistic order @xmath13 is replaced by the pauli - hamiltonian @xmath14 { \\bf 1}_2 -   \\frac{e\\hbar}{2mc}\\,\\vec{b}(\\vec{x})\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\ .\\ ] ] for further information , see @xcite .",
    "we remark that for the following the explicit form of the right - most term in ( [ hp ] ) , describing a coupling of spin to the translational degrees of freedom , is inessential",
    ". it can be any operator of the form @xmath15 , where the components of @xmath16 are suitable functions on phase space ; e.g. , @xmath17 would yield a spin - orbit coupling in a spherically symmetric potential .    in applications",
    "one is sometimes also interested in describing a coupling of spin and translational degrees of freedom that is semiclassically strong . in this case",
    "one would consider a ( pauli- ) hamiltonian of the form @xmath18 { \\bf 1}_2 +   \\vec{d}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{{\\text{i}}}\\nabla,\\vec{x}\\right)\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\ , \\ ] ] where again the components @xmath19 are suitable functions on phase space ( independent of @xmath20 ) .",
    "all of the above hamiltonians can be represented as weyl operators , i.e. , their action on @xmath21-component spinors @xmath22 , where @xmath23 applies to the case of dirac spinors and @xmath24 to pauli spinors , can be given as @xmath25 on the right - hand side the weyl symbol @xmath26 is a function on phase space taking values in the hermitian @xmath27 matrices .",
    "for the hamiltonians ( [ hd]),([hp ] ) and ( [ hpalt ] ) these arise upon replacing @xmath28 by @xmath29 .    in the case of the dirac - hamiltonian ( [ hd ] ) the symbol",
    "@xmath30 is a hermitian @xmath7 matrix with the two doubly degenerate eigenvalues @xmath31 these eigenvalues can be recognized as the classical relativistic hamiltonians for spinless particles @xmath32 and anti - particles @xmath33 .",
    "the fact that the corresponding eigenspaces are two dimensional reflects the quantum mechanical spin 1/2 of the particles and anti - particles .",
    "more precisely , at each point @xmath34 of phase space the eigenspaces of @xmath35 can be viewed as hilbert spaces of a spin 1/2 , one for particles and one for anti - particles .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "the situation is similar for the pauli - hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) , except for the absence of anti - particles : @xmath36 is a hermitian @xmath12 matrix , @xmath37 { \\bf 1}_2 -   \\frac{e\\hbar}{2mc}\\,\\vec{b}(\\vec{x})\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\ , \\ ] ] whose classical part ( independent of @xmath20 ) is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "this principal symbol therefore has one doubly degenerate eigenvalue , @xmath38 , which simply is the factor multiplying @xmath11 .",
    "it can readily be identified as the classical non - relativistic hamiltonian for spinless particles . as in the previous case spin",
    "is represented by the corresponding two dimensional eigenspace of the principal symbol , which in this case is trivial .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hpalt ] ) , however , leads to a different interpretation of its symbol , @xmath39 { \\bf 1}_2 +   \\vec{d}(\\vec{p},\\vec{x})\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\ , \\ ] ] since this is independent of @xmath20 and thus has to be considered as a classical quantity in its entirety .",
    "its two eigenvalues @xmath40 are classical non - relativistic hamiltonians of a particle with fixed spin up or down , respectively . here ` up ' and ` down ' are defined with respect to the direction of @xmath41 at the respective point @xmath34 in phase space .",
    "the eigenvalues ( [ hpalteigenv ] ) are non - degenerate as long as they are different , i.e. , away from mode conversion points where @xmath42 .    from the above discussions one may anticipate that in the semiclassical considerations of the hamiltonians ( [ hd ] ) and",
    "( [ hp ] ) to follow ( see also @xcite ) there will occur classical translational dynamics that are uninfluenced by spin , and quantum mechanical spin dynamics driven by the classical translational motion . in contrast , in the case of the hamiltonian ( [ hpalt ] ) the classical translational motion will depend on the ( fixed ) direction of the spin and there will be no additional spin dynamics .",
    "gutzwiller s trace formula provides a semiclassical expansion for the quantum mechanical density of states . since this quantity a priori requires a hamiltonian with a discrete spectrum , we now want to discuss the spectra of the hamiltonians ( [ hd ] ) , ( [ hp ] ) and ( [ hpalt ] ) .",
    "dirac - hamiltonians typically possess continuous spectra . indeed",
    ", if the electromagnetic fields vanish as @xmath43 , @xmath13 has an essential spectrum consisting of two half axes , @xmath44\\cup   [ + mc^2,+\\infty)$ ] , see @xcite for precise statements .",
    "thus , since we are interested in the discrete spectrum of a hamiltonian , we have to localise in energy to within the gap @xmath45 of the essential spectrum .",
    "to this end one can choose a smooth function @xmath46 that vanishes outside of some interval contained in @xmath45 and then considers the hamiltonian @xmath47 .",
    "this now has a purely discrete spectrum with eigenvalues @xmath48 , if the @xmath49 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to the other hamiltonians , if situations arise where their spectra are not purely discrete or when one is only interested in certain spectral stretches . for the purpose of deriving a semiclassical trace formula one",
    "then considers a truncated time evolution operator @xmath52 whose spectral expansion in position representation reads @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the eigenspinor of @xmath55 associated with @xmath49 .",
    "the gutzwiller trace formula has found many applications in the field of quantum chaos @xcite in which the principal questions are associated with the distribution of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of quantum hamiltonians in relation to properties of the corresponding classical dynamics . in this context one",
    "first confines oneself to some spectral interval @xmath56 that contains @xmath57 eigenvalues ; universal statistical properties then emerge in the semiclassical limit @xmath58 . here",
    "we implement this procedure by first choosing an interval @xmath59 \\ , \\ ] ] and then performing the limit @xmath60 ; and although the length of @xmath56 shrinks to zero , @xmath61 diverges in this limit ( see below ) . in this approach",
    "the localisation in energy described above hence appears to be very natural .",
    "the quantum mechanical observables we consider are ( bounded ) weyl operators , i.e. , they can be represented as in ( [ hweyl ] ) .",
    "their symbols @xmath62 are then functions on phase space taking values in the hermitian @xmath27 matrices , and we suppose that they allow for asymptotic expansions in @xmath20 , @xmath63 the precise meaning of such expansions is explained in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20-independent term @xmath64 , the principal symbol of the operator @xmath65 , represents the classical observable associated with @xmath65 , at least concerning the translational degrees of freedom .",
    "expectation values of observables can be represented in terms of the symbol once one introduces a matrix valued wigner transform of a spinor @xmath66 through @xmath67_{kl}(\\vec{p},\\vec{x } ) : = \\int{\\text{e}}^{-\\frac{{\\text{i}}}{\\hbar}\\vec{p}\\cdot \\vec{y}}\\overline{\\psi_k}(\\vec{x}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\vec{y})\\,\\psi_l(\\vec{x } + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\vec{y})\\ { \\text{d}}y \\ .\\ ] ] then @xmath68(\\vec{p},\\vec{x})\\,b(\\vec{p},\\vec{x } ) \\right)\\   { \\text{d}}p\\,{\\text{d}}x\\ .\\ ] ]",
    "gutzwiller s approach to the trace formula @xcite was to depart from a semiclassical expansion of the time evolution operator in position representation ( [ kernelexpan ] ) . expressing this in terms of a feynman path integral and evaluating it in leading semiclassical order with the method of stationary phase",
    ", he arrived at a representation of the kernel @xmath69 in terms of a sum over the classical trajectories connecting @xmath70 and @xmath71 in time @xmath72 . in this context",
    "he made the important observation @xcite that for not too small times @xmath72 each term in this sum must contain an extra phase factor that essentially consists of the morse index of this trajectory .",
    "here we are interested in a trace formula for quantum systems with spin that yields a semiclassical expansion of a weighted and smeared spectral density , where the weights are provided by the expectation values of an observable @xmath65 in the eigenstates of the hamiltonian and the smearing ensures convergence of the sums involved , see also @xcite . to this end the ` spectral ' side of the trace formula is given by @xmath73 in this expression @xmath74 is a smooth , regularising function with fourier transform @xmath75 that is also smooth and vanishes outside of some compact interval .",
    "the trace on the right - hand side will now be calculated in position representation , after the leading semiclassical order of ( [ kernelexpan ] ) , i.e. , the appropriate van vleck - gutzwiller propagator , has been introduced .      in an alternative approach to gutzwiller",
    "s semiclassical expansion of the propagator ( [ kernelexpan ] ) , making use of a feynman path integral , one represents the kernel in a way that is closely related to the wkb method .",
    "more precisely , one chooses the ansatz @xmath76 and determines the phase @xmath77 and the coefficients @xmath78 of the amplitude by requiring that @xmath69 solves the schrdinger ( dirac , pauli ) equation to arbitrary powers in @xmath20 with an appropriate initial condition at @xmath79 . in the cases of the quantum hamiltonians ( [ hd ] ) , ( [ hp ] ) and ( [ hpalt ] ) it turns out that the corresponding phases @xmath77 have to be solutions of hamilton - jacobi equations with @xmath80 , @xmath38 and @xmath81 , respectively , as classical hamiltonians ( see ( [ hdeigenv])([hpalteigenv ] ) ) .",
    "the matrix valued coefficients @xmath78 of the amplitudes are determined by a hierarchy of ( transport ) equations that can be solved order by order in @xmath20 , starting with the leading expression @xmath82 , which apart from the contribution of the translational motion contains the leading order of the spin dynamics . knowing the solutions @xmath77 and @xmath82 , one then still has to evaluate the integral ( [ kernwkb ] ) over @xmath83 with the method of stationary phase .",
    "the details of this calculation can be found in @xcite .    since @xmath77 is a solution of a hamilton - jacobi equation , it is a generating function of a canonical transformation , @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 , such that @xmath87 and @xmath34 are starting and end points , respectively , of a solution of the equations of motion generated by the respective classical hamiltonian .",
    "the stationary points @xmath88 of the phase in ( [ kernwkb ] ) are now uniquely related to classical trajectories from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , since the condition of stationarity reads @xmath89 .",
    "the stationary point @xmath88 itself hence is the momentum of the associated trajectory at time zero .",
    "thus the sum over the stationary points leads to a sum over classical trajectories ; see @xcite for the explicit form of these sums . in the cases of the dirac- and pauli - hamiltonians ( [ hd ] ) and ( [ hp ] )",
    "the trajectories that contribute are purely translational without contributions from spin ( since the respective classical hamiltonians contain no spin ) .",
    "the latter only contributes through weight factors that come from the leading term @xmath90 of the amplitude .",
    "since this is evaluated at the stationary point @xmath88 , the spin contribution derives from a precession along the associated classical trajectory . for a further discussion see also the next subsection ; more details are described in @xcite .    only in the case of the hamiltonian ( [ hpalt ] )",
    "is the spin already directly contained on a classical level , see ( [ hpalteigenv ] ) .",
    "here one has to deal with the ( two ) translational dynamics of a particle whose spin is tight to the direction of the external ` field ' @xmath41 , such that it follows this direction adiabatically along the trajectories of the particle .",
    "this adiabatic motion of the spin is reflected in the occurrence of a certain geometric phase , which has in the context of a bohr - sommerfeld quantisation been introduced by littlejohn and flynn @xcite , see also @xcite for a discussion in the context of a trace formula .      in the cases of the dirac- and pauli - hamiltonians ( [ hd ] ) and ( [ hp ] )",
    "there indeed is a dynamics of the spin degrees of freedom , which is driven by the classical translational motion .",
    "these driven dynamics derive from the transport equation for the lowest order amplitude @xmath91 after separation of the purely translational part .",
    "the spin transport equation that hence results reads @xcite @xmath92 with initial condition @xmath93 .",
    "its solution , the spin transport matrix @xmath94 , propagates the ( quantum ) spin 1/2 along the classical trajectory @xmath95 starting at @xmath34 . the vector @xmath16 depends on which hamiltonian one considers and contains the fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 ; for a pauli - hamiltonian @xmath98 the quantity @xmath99 is precisely the one described below ( [ hp ] ) .",
    "moreover , if the vector @xmath100 denotes the expectation value of the ( normalised ) spin operator @xmath101 in a two - component spinor @xmath102 , this ` classical ' spin obeys the equation @xmath103 of classical spin precession and thus provides an ehrenfest relation for the spin . in the relativistic case ( [ spinprecess ] )",
    "yields the well known thomas precession , which rubinow and keller @xcite were the first to derive semiclassically from the dirac equation .",
    "one can now combine the hamiltonian translational motion and the spin dynamics that are driven by the former one into a single dynamical system on a combined phase space , @xmath104 .",
    "in ergodic theory such combinations are known as ` skew products ' of the two types of dynamics . in applications to quantum chaos the ergodic properties of precisely these combined dynamics determine the ` quantum chaotic ' properties of the quantum system , see @xcite .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the ` semiclassical side ' of the trace formula emerges upon introducing the leading semiclassical order of the propagator ( [ kernwkb ] ) on the right - hand side of ( [ spectf ] ) and evaluating all integrals , which involve the variables @xmath105 , with the method of stationary phase .",
    "since this method requires all stationary points @xmath106 to be non - degenerate , the trace formula can only be derived under appropriate conditions on the classical systems . in particular , since the stationary points are such that the phase space points @xmath107 lie on a periodic orbit with energy @xmath108 ( that appears on the left - hand side of ( [ spectf ] ) ) and period @xmath109 , the conditions have indeed to be imposed on the periodic orbits .",
    "one such condition is that @xmath108 must not be a critical value of the relevant classical hamiltonians , i.e. , @xmath110 for all @xmath34 on the energy shell @xmath111 .",
    "this condition ensures that all stationary points with @xmath112 are non - degenerate .",
    "the corresponding points @xmath107 make up all of the energy shell @xmath113 and the contribution of these stationary points yields the leading semiclassical term ( also called weyl term ) on the right - hand side of the trace formula .    for the following we restrict our attention to the case where all non - trivial periodic orbits @xmath114 ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) are isolated and non - degenerate .",
    "this means that their monodromy matrices @xmath116 , describing the linear stability of the orbits , have no eigenvalues one .",
    "this does not exclude elliptic orbits , if these are isolated , but only parabolic ( marginally stable ) ones .",
    "furthermore , we give the trace formula explicitly for the case of a dirac - hamiltonian ( [ hd ] ) and with the inclusion of an observable @xmath65 .",
    "the other cases follow from this trace formula by specialising to the appropriate simplified situations ; e.g. , the pauli - hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) has no contribution from anti - particles and therefore only contains one type of ( translational ) classical dynamics .",
    "in contrast , the hamiltonian ( [ hpalt ] ) does lead to two types of classical dynamics , generated by ( [ hpalteigenv ] ) , but has no independent spin dynamics ; there only is an additional geometric phase as described in @xcite .",
    "now the trace formula reads @xcite @xmath117 the first term on the right - hand side is the so - called weyl term and yields the leading semiclassical approximation of the left - hand side .",
    "it essentially contains the averages @xmath118 of the principal symbol @xmath64 of the observable over the two energy shells @xmath119 .",
    "the two contributions are weighted according to the relative volumes of the respective energy shells .",
    "the characteristic quantities appearing in the sum over the two types @xmath120 of periodic orbits are the same as in the case of the gutzwiller trace formula for the spectral density of a quantum system without spin : there is an exponential factor with the actions @xmath121 , and an amplitude that contains the well known part @xmath122 with the associated primitive period , the maslov index @xmath123 , and the stability denominator .",
    "the additional factors come from the regularisation and from the presence of the observable .",
    "in particular , @xmath124 denotes an average of the projection of @xmath64 to one of the eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues ( [ hdeigenv ] ) , weighted with the spin transport matrix @xmath125 , along the periodic orbit @xmath126 . details of this average are described in @xcite .    a trace formula for a truncated spectral density , with only contributions from the discrete spectrum of @xmath13 , can be obtained from ( [ diractf ] ) by choosing the observable @xmath127 and removing the regularisation provided by the function @xmath128 .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath129 where here @xmath130 denotes the spin transport matrix associated with the transport of spin once along the periodic orbit .",
    "one immediately observes that in contrast to the gutzwiller trace formula without spin two types of classical dynamics ( particles and anti - particles ) occur , and spin contributes a factor of two in the weyl term as well as weights @xmath131 for the periodic orbits describing the effect of spin transport .",
    "obviously , the weyl term in ( [ tfdense ] ) yields the semiclassically leading contribution to the spectral density .",
    "this allows to derive the leading semiclassical asymptotics of the number @xmath61 of eigenvalues in the interval ( [ idef ] ) , which is given by @xmath132 times the weyl term , and hence @xmath61 diverges as @xmath133 in the semiclassical limit .",
    "many applications of the gutzwiller trace formula originate from problems in the field of quantum chaos ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . apart from the question for semiclassical quantisation rules ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) one of the major successes in this field was berry s semiclassical analysis of spectral two - point correlations @xcite based on the trace formula . in a certain range of validity , which stems from the so - called diagonal approximation berry employed , he verified that the two - point correlations of energy levels of classically chaotic quantum systems ( without spin ) follow the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "subsequently , bogomolny and keating @xcite extended berry s result in that they went one step beyond the diagonal approximation .",
    "the first application of trace formula techniques , without , however , having a complete trace formula available , to quantum systems with spin goes back to frisk and guhr @xcite .",
    "they considered a quantum hamiltonian of the type ( [ hpalt ] ) describing spin - orbit coupling in certain billiards . in spirit , they applied the trace formula in ` reverse direction ' in that they used quantum energy levels in order to obtain information about the contribution of various types of periodic orbits .",
    "similar studies can be found in @xcite .",
    "a second type of applications concerns an extension of the semiclassical analysis of spectral two - point correlations to quantum systems with spin 1/2 .",
    "if a time - reversal symmetry is present , kramers degeneracy implies that all energy levels of a quantum system with half - integer spin are doubly degenerate .",
    "after removal of this systematic multiplicity , the spectral statistics should be described by the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) of rmt , if the corresponding classical system is chaotic . without time - reversal symmetry",
    "kramers degeneracy is absent , and the relevant ensemble of rmt is the gaussian unitary one ( gue ) . in @xcite berry s semiclassical approach is carried out with the trace formula ( [ diractf ] ) , or ( [ tfdense ] ) , as a basis .",
    "it is shown that , within the same range of validity as in @xcite , indeed the two - point correlations agree with the gse or gue , respectively . moreover , in @xcite the bogomolny - keating method is carried over to the case of spin 1/2 , with the same findings . in both studies , apart from a chaotic translational motion , ergodic properties of the combined dynamics described below ( [ spinprecess ] ) are needed in order to obtain an agreement with the rmt predictions .",
    "the weyl term of the trace formula ( [ diractf ] ) moreover allows to determine a semiclassical average of the expectation values @xmath134 in eigenstates of @xmath13 with @xmath135 .",
    "the result is given by @xcite @xmath136 and does not require the classical system to be chaotic .",
    "the only requirement is that the set of periodic orbits on both energy shells must be of measure zero , which is a comparatively weak condition . only if one requires individual expectation values to approach the expression on the right - hand side of ( [ szegoe ] ) as @xmath60 one needs a stronger condition on the classical side ,",
    "since then no cancelations on the left - hand side are allowed . for the case of pauli - hamiltonians ( [ hp ] ) it has been proven @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that almost all expectation values indeed converge to the equivalent of the right - hand side of ( [ szegoe ] ) , if the combined dynamics of translational and spin degrees of freedom are ergodic . for quantum systems without spin such a result had been known before under the notion of quantum ergodicity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
