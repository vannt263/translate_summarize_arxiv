    "<S> they also support gapless edge states and/or nontrivial degenerate structures in the entanglement spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> while the notion of the spt phases is now established and widely recognized , in this work we demonstrate that site - centered inversion symmetry allows to distinguish different trivial one - dimensional phases . </S>",

    "<S> \\label{eq.ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term is the standard heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions which stabilize the celebrated haldane gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 term is the uniaxial single - ion anisotropy , which is commonly present in magnetic ions with @xmath0 such as ni@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the model with uniaxial anisotropy @xmath2 and @xmath4 is well understood @xcite . for small @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the system is in the haldane phase and undergoes a quantum phase transition into the `` large-@xmath6 '' phase at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> both phases are gapped and have the full symmetry of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the haldane phase is a well - known example of spt phases @xcite as discussed in the introduction . </S>",
    "<S> the large-@xmath6 phase is a trivial phase which is adiabatically connected to the product state @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the local spin state with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this state is the exact ground state of the hamiltonian   in the limit @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 term represents a staggered field , which occurs in many quasi - one - dimensional materials , including haldane gap systems , with an alternating crystal structure under an applied ( uniform ) field . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we only include the staggered field term without the uniform one .    in the limit @xmath13 , the spins are fully polarized along the staggered field , and the ground state is reduced to another trivial product state @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the local spin states with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . it was recognized earlier that there is no phase transition for @xmath19 ( for @xmath20 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the haldane phase is adiabatically connected to the nel state @xmath21 with imposed antiferromagnetic ( af ) order . in the spt framework , this is naturally understood ; since the staggered field breaks all the symmetries that protect the haldane phase as an spt phase , it reduces the haldane phase to a trivial phase which also includes the nel state @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us discuss the model with both @xmath2 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this model has been studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by a field theory and numerical methods where a quantum phase transition between the large-@xmath6 phase and the imposed af phase was found . </S>",
    "<S> this is rather surprising , since both phases are trivial and are adiabatically connected to product states @xmath22 and @xmath21 that have the full symmetry of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps even more surprising in the light of the recent concept of the spt phases , where the existing classification scheme @xcite would not distinguish them . while the nature of the phase transition were studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , why ( and when ) these two trivial phases are distinguished was not completely clarified . in the remainder of this paper , we demonstrate that this is an example of distinct spt phases and identify the symmetry which protects them .    _ </S>",
    "<S> bosonization. _ the standard bosonization procedure of @xmath0 chains starts from two coupled @xmath23 chains , and the low - energy effective field theory for @xmath24 is given by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath25 \\notag \\\\ & + { g_\\textrm{eff}}\\int dx \\cos{(2\\phi ) } , \\label{eq : effham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dual field of each other , satisfying @xmath28 = i(\\pi/2)[\\textrm{sgn } ( x - x')+1]$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian   represents the so - called sine - gordon field theory , which is ubiquitous in many problems in @xmath29 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> its properties essentially depend on the coupling constant @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath31 , the coupling @xmath32 is irrelevant under the renormalization group ( rg ) , and the system is renormalized in the low - energy limit into the free boson theory with @xmath33 , which is nothing but a gapless tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath34 and @xmath32 is non - vanishing , the interaction is rg - relevant , and the system acquires an excitation gap . in the absence of the staggered field , the haldane and the large-@xmath6 phases correspond to @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , both with @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that , within the effective hamiltonian  , the two phases with @xmath35 and @xmath36 are always separated by the critical point @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this actually comes from the fact that @xmath37 is the only interaction compatible with the symmetry and the compactification , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , up to subleading terms @xmath40 @xmath41 . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the effective theory can also have the @xmath42 term , which can be combined with the @xmath43 term as @xmath44 with a phase shift @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that , by changing @xmath45 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , the two phases with @xmath35 and @xmath36 are adiabatically connected without closing the gap @xcite . </S>",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fact , in the framework of bosonization , this is how a symmetry protects the haldane phase as an spt phase which is distinct from the trivial large-@xmath6 phase . </S>",

    "<S> , for brevity , among these three symmetries , we only show the representation of the bond - centered inversion @xmath48 in terms of the bosonic field @xmath26 , @xmath27 in table  [ table : symop ] . </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , forbids @xmath50 , which leads to the distinction of the two phases with @xmath35 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , table  [ table : symop ] shows that the site - centered inversion @xmath51 also has the same action on @xmath26 , forbidding @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath51 by itself is not sufficient to keep the distinction between the two phases ; they are adiabatically connected without gap closing , because of the vertex operators @xmath52 allowed in the absence of the u(1 ) symmetry of spin rotation about @xmath53 axis . according to table  [ </S>",
    "<S> table : symop ] , the combined operation @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the global @xmath47-rotation about @xmath53 axis ) , as well as @xmath48 , forbids @xmath52 . they still allow the next leading ones @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , they just replace the direct transition between the @xmath35 and @xmath36 phases by an intermediate phase with spontaneous @xmath57-symmetry breaking . </S>",

    "<S> this term breaks not only the u(1 ) spin - rotational symmetry about @xmath53 axis , but also both @xmath51 and @xmath55 as individual symmetries . </S>",

    "<S> we showed the existence of such phases by field - theoretical arguments based on bosonization and presented a general proof based on the mps formalism . </S>",
    "<S> while it is known that distinct trivial phases can exist in translation - invariant systems @xcite , it is surprising that only point - group symmetries can stabilize distinct trivial phases in simple 1d systems . </S>",
    "<S> our finding implies that more studies are needed for complete classification of quantum phases in one dimension under symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we derived non - local order parameter that could be measured in optical lattice realizations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , even without any measurement of the non - local order parameter , the quantum phase transition separating the distinct spt phases can be detected in standard experimental measurements , such as a divergence of the low - temperature specific heat when the gap is closing . </S>",
    "<S> this , in fact , is more in line with the operational definition of the spt phases .    </S>",
    "<S> the notion of the spt phases is not restricted to one - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , what appear as examples of spt phases in two dimensions were discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of universal theoretical description of quantum many - body systems in higher dimensions makes a systematic analysis of spt phases more difficult than in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it would be certainly an interesting direction for the future .    </S>",
