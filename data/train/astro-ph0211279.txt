    "powerful classical double - lobed radio galaxies are ( at low redshifts ) hosted almost exclusively by luminous early - type galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are usually elliptical galaxies . given that normal elliptical galaxies usually exhibit undetectable quantities of cool ( neutral ) gas , what fuels the central supermassive black holes in elliptical radio galaxies ?",
    "our @xmath4co survey of a complete sample of 3c galaxies at low redshift ( lim et al .",
    ", this volume ) reveals that the vast majority have 5@xmath5 upper limits in molecular gas masses of 2 - 5 x 10@xmath6 ( for a linewidth of  500 km / s and a galactic co - to - h@xmath7 conversion factor ) . to better understand the molecular gas content of classical radio galaxies",
    ", we are undertaking a survey of nearby early - type powerful radio galaxies .",
    "these galaxies were originally selected for study by verdoes kleijn et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with the hst , and were drawn from a catalog of one - hundred seventy - six radio - loud galaxies constructed by condon & broderick ( 1988 ) .",
    "of the eighteen galaxies where sensitive 12co measurements have now been made , we detected eight ( i.e. , a detection rate of 45% ) .",
    "the galaxies have molecular gas masses in the range 10@xmath8 10@xmath9 .",
    "all the galaxies detected have double - horned 12co line profiles characteristic of a rotating disk or torus , commensurate with the disk - like dust features seen in these galaxies . in the case of 3c 31 , our follow - up imaging observations with the iram pdbi confirm that the molecular gas is distributed in a rotating disk / torus with size similar to its dust disk .",
    "these results , summarized in table 1 , reinforce our argument ( lim et al .",
    "2000 ) that , in the vast majority of cases , the molecular gas in powerful classical radio galaxies most likely originates from a merger between a pre - existing elliptical galaxy and a relatively less massive gas - rich ( disk ) galaxy .",
    "radio activity is triggered only when sufficient gas reaches the nucleus of the elliptical galaxy , thereby explaining the relatively relaxed nature of both the accreted molecular gas and parent elliptical galaxy .",
