    "<S> we present a relativistic constituent - quark model that covers all known baryons from the nucleon up to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding invariant mass operator includes a linear confinement and a hyperfine interaction based on effective degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the model provides for a unified description of practically all baryon spectra in good agreement with present phenomenology and it can tentatively be employed for the relativistic treatment of all kinds of baryon reactions . </S>",
    "<S> predictions of states still missing in the phenomenological data base , especially in the lesser explored heavy - flavor sectors of charm and bottom baryons , should be important especially for future experiments in these areas .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is generally considered as the fundamental theory of strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> while it has been well established in the perturbative regime at high energies , qcd still lacks a comprehensive solution at low and intermediate energies , even 40 years after its invention . in order to deal with the wealth of non - perturbative phenomena </S>",
    "<S> , various approaches are followed with limited validity and applicability . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially also true for lattice </S>",
    "<S> qcd , various functional methods , or chiral perturbation theory , to name only a few . in neither one of these approaches the full dynamical content of qcd can yet be included . </S>",
    "<S> basically , the difficulties are associated with a relativistically covariant treatment of confinement and the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath1s ) , the latter being a well - established property of qcd at low and intermediate energies . as a result , most hadron reactions , like resonance excitations , strong and electroweak decays etc . </S>",
    "<S> , are nowadays only amenable to models of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> most famous is the constituent - quark model ( cqm ) , which essentially relies on a limited number of effective degrees of freedom with the aim of encoding the essential features of low- and intermediate - energy qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> the cqm has a long history , and it has made important contributions to the understanding of many hadron properties , think only of the fact that the systematization of hadrons in the standard particle - data base  @xcite follows the valence - quark picture . over the decades </S>",
    "<S> the cqm has ripened into a stage where its formulation and solution are well based on a relativistic ( or more generally poincar - invariant ) quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic constituent - quark models ( rcqm ) have been developed by several groups , however , with limited domains of validity . </S>",
    "<S> of course , it is desirable to have a framework as universal as possible for the description of all kinds of hadron processes in the low- and intermediate - energy regions . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially true in view of the advent of ever more data on heavy - baryon spectroscopy from present and future experimental facilities .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a rcqm that comprises all known baryons with flavors @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 within a single framework . </S>",
    "<S> there have been only a few efforts so far to extend a cqm from light- to heavy - flavor baryons . </S>",
    "<S> we may mention , for example , the approach by the bonn group who have developed a rcqm , based on the t hooft instanton interaction , along a microscopic theory solving the salpeter equation  @xcite and extended their model to charmed baryons  @xcite , still not yet covering bottom baryons . </S>",
    "<S> a further quark - model attempt has been undertaken by the mons - lige group relying on the large-@xmath7 expansion  @xcite , partially extended to heavy - flavor baryons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , efforts are invested to expand other approaches to heavy baryons , such as the employment of dyson - schwinger equations together with either quark - diquark or three - quark calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also an increased amount of more refined lattice - qcd results has by now become available on heavy - baryon spectra ( see , e.g. , the recent work by liu et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references cited therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our rcqm is based on the invariant mass operator @xmath8 where the free part corresponds to the total kinetic energy of the three - quark system and the interaction part contains the dynamics of the constituent quarks @xmath9 . in the rest frame of the baryon , </S>",
    "<S> where its three - momentum @xmath10 , we may express the terms as @xmath11 @xmath12 here , the @xmath13 correspond to the three - momentum operators of the individual quarks with rest masses @xmath14 and the @xmath9-@xmath9 potentials @xmath15 are composed of confinement and hyperfine interactions . by employing such a mass operator @xmath16 , with baryon four - momentum @xmath17 , the poincar algebra involving all ten generators @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 ) , or equivalently @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 ) , of time and space translations , spatial rotations as well as lorentz boosts , can be guaranteed . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the eigenvalue problem of the mass operator @xmath22 yields the relativistically invariant mass spectra as well as the baryon eigenstates ( the latter , of course , initially in the standard rest frame ) .    we adopt the confinement depending linearly on the @xmath9-@xmath9 distance @xmath23 @xmath24 with the strength @xmath25 @xmath26 , corresponding to the string tension of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath27 mev is only necessary to set the ground state of the whole baryon spectrum , i.e. , the proton mass ; it is irrelevant , if one considers only level spacings .    </S>",
    "<S> the hyperfine interaction is most essential to describe all of the baryon excitation spectra . in a unified model </S>",
    "<S> the hyperfine potential must be explicitly flavor - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , e.g. , the @xmath28 and @xmath29 spectra with their distinct level orderings could not be reproduced simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> at least for baryons with flavors @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 the type of hyperfine interaction taking into account sb@xmath1s has been most successful over the past years . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , it grabs the essential degrees of freedom governing the behavior of low - energy baryons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rcqm constructed along this dynamical concept , i.e. , on goldstone - boson exchange ( gbe ) , has provided a comprehensive description of all light and strange baryons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is not only true with regard to the spectroscopy but to a large extent also for other baryon properties , like electromagnetic and axial form factors  @xcite and a number of other reaction observables ( for a concise summary see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been tempting to extend this successful concept even to the heavier flavors @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by such studies one should in addition </S>",
    "<S> learn about the proper light - heavy and heavy - heavy hyperfine @xmath9-@xmath9 interactions . some exploratory work in this direction </S>",
    "<S> had already been undertaken some time ago in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , hinting to promising results also for charm and bottom baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore we have advocated for the hyperfine interaction of our universal rcqm the @xmath30 gbe potential @xmath31\\vec{\\sigma}_i \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}_j~.\\ ] ] here , we take into account only its spin - spin component , which produces the most important hyperfine forces for the baryon spectra . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath32 represent the pauli spin matrices of @xmath33 , the @xmath34 are the generalized gell - mann flavor matrices of @xmath30 for quark @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the exchange of the pseudoscalar 24-plet also the flavor - singlet is included because of the @xmath36 anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> the radial form of the gbe potential resembles the one of the pseudoscalar meson exchange @xmath37 \\label{delta}\\ ] ] for @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> herein the @xmath40-function must be smeared out leading to  @xcite @xmath41 \\,.\\ ] ] contrary to the earlier gbe rcqm  @xcite , which uses several different exchange masses @xmath42 and different cut - offs @xmath43 , corresponding to @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46=@xmath47 mesons , we here managed to get along with a universal gbe mass @xmath48 and a single cut - off @xmath49 for the 24-plet of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> only the singlet exchange comes with another mass @xmath50 and another cut - off @xmath51 with a separate coupling constant @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the number of open parameters in the hyperfine interaction could be kept as low as only three ( see tab .  [ free parameters ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> ccc +   + @xmath53 & @xmath49 [ @xmath54 & @xmath51 [ @xmath54 +   + 1.5 & 3.55 & 7.52 +    all other parameters entering the model have judiciously been predetermined by existing phenomenological insights . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the constituent quark masses have been set to the values as given in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fixed parameters ] . </S>",
    "<S> the 24-plet goldstone - boson ( gb ) mass has been assumed as the value of the @xmath55 mass and similarly the singlet mass as the one of the @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the universal coupling constant of the 24-plet has been chosen according to the value derived from the @xmath55-@xmath28 coupling constant via the goldberger - treiman relation .    </S>",
    "<S> ccccccc +   + & & coupling + @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath48 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 +   + 340 & 480 & 1675 & 5055 & 139 & 958 & 0.7 +    we have calculated the baryon spectra of the relativistically invariant mass operator @xmath22 to a high accuracy both by the stochastic variational method  @xcite as well as the modified faddeev integral equations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present universal gbe rcqm produces the spectra in the light and strange sectors with similar or even better quality than the previous gbe rcqm  @xcite ( see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : light ] and  [ fig : strange ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the right level orderings specifically in the @xmath28 , @xmath63 and @xmath29 spectra as well as all other @xmath64 ground and excited states are reproduced in accordance with phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons are exactly the same as for the previous gbe rcqm , which has already been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the case of the @xmath29(1405 ) excitation could still not be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> it remains as an intriguing problem for all three - quark cqms .     </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : light ] but for the strange baryons.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] +    what is most interesting in the context of the present work are the very properties of the light - heavy and heavy - heavy @xmath9-@xmath9 hyperfine interactions . </S>",
    "<S> can the gbe dynamics reasonably account for them ? in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : charm ] and  [ fig : bottom ] we show the spectra of all charm and bottom baryons that experimental data with at least three- or four - star status by the pdg  @xcite are available for   and @xmath65 are missing , as we are presently not in the position to calculate baryons with three different constituent - quark masses . ] . </S>",
    "<S> as is clearly seen , our universal gbe rcqm can reproduce all levels with respectable accuracy . in the @xmath66 and @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> spectra some experimental levels are not known with regard to their spin and parity @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> they are shown in the right - most columns of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : charm ] . </S>",
    "<S> obviously they could easily be accommodated in accordance with the theoretical spectra , once their @xmath68 s are determined . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the model predicts some additional excited states for charm and bottom baryons that are presently missing in the phenomenological data base .    </S>",
    "<S> of course , the presently available data base on charm and bottom baryon states is not yet very rich and thus not particularly selective for tests of effective @xmath9-@xmath9 hyperfine forces . the situation will certainly improve with the advent of further data from ongoing and planned experiments . beyond the comparison to experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the theoretical spectra produced by our present gbe rcqm are also in good agreement with existing lattice - qcd results for heavy - flavor baryons . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially true for the charm baryons vis -  - vis the recent work by liu et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further comparisons with results from lattice qcd and alternative methods will be given in a forthcoming more detailed article  @xcite , where also a number of additional theoretical spectra up to @xmath0 will be presented ( for which , however , no phenomenological data exist so far ) .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : light ] but for bottom baryons.,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=188 ] +    we emphasize that the most important ingredients into the present rcqm are relativity , or more generally poincar invariance , and a hyperfine interaction that is derived from an interaction lagrangian built from effective fermion ( constituent quark ) and boson ( goldstone boson ) fields connected by a pseudoscalar coupling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that such kind of dynamics is quite appropriate for constituent quarks of any flavor . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the hyperfine forces do not at all become tentatively small for baryons with charm and bottom flavors . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> at least the heavy - light interactions are of the same importance for the level spacings as the light - light interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this has already been seen for charm baryons in the work by the bonn group  @xcite and is also true for our universal gbe rcqm ( as will be detailed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite too ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is furthermore in line with findings from earlier lattice - qcd calculations  @xcite .    as a result </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated by the proposed gbe rcqm that a universal description of all known baryons is possible in a single model . here , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered only the baryon masses ( eigenvalues of the invariant mass operator @xmath22 ) . beyond spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> the present model will be subject to further tests with regard to the baryon eigenstates , which are simultaneously obtained from the solution of the eigenvalue problem of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> they must prove reasonable in order to make the model a useful tool for the treatment of all kinds of baryons reactions within a universal framework . </S>"
