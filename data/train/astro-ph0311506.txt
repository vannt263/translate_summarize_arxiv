    "_ planck _ is a european space agency satellite designed to produce high - resolution temperature and polarisation maps of the cmb .",
    "it possesses detectors sensitive to a wide range of frequencies from 30 to 857 ghz , split between two instruments the hfi and lfi , the high and low frequency instruments , respectively .",
    "_ planck _ is scheduled for launch in 2007 , when it will be inserted into a lissajous orbit around the second lagrange point of the earth - sun system . _",
    "planck _ will spin about its axis once per minute , sweeping its detectors along an almost great circle , the line of sight being almost perpendicular to the spin axis .",
    "the spin axis will nominally be repositioned every hour , and the roughly 60 or so circles corresponding to a single spin axis positioning may be binned together to form a ring .",
    "the spin axis passes through the centre of the solar panels and is directed towards the sun , thus maintaining the rest of the satellite in a cone of shadow produced by the solar panels .",
    "the scanning strategy is determined by the frequency and the positions of the spin axis repointings over the course of the mission .",
    "the baseline scanning strategy is such that the spin axis remains in the ecliptic plane throughout the course of the mission and it maintains its sun - wards direction by hourly respositionings of 2.5 . in reality",
    "this scanning strategy will not be employed due to the lack of coverage at the ecliptic poles ; the actual scanning strategy , however , has yet to be finalised .",
    "this paper will investigate some of the issues concerning the evaluation of parameters required for the pointing reconstruction of the _ planck _ satellite , specifically those resulting from non - zero off - diagonal elements in the inertia tensor as defined in the nominal satellite reference frame .",
    "the slight misalignment between the nominal spin axis of the satellite and the nearest principal axis of the inertia tensor defines the effective boresight angle and the rotation of the focal plane .",
    "these parameters may only be established using the science data , and they will vary over the course of the mission due to changes in the inertia tensor as consumables are depleted .",
    "it is therefore important to assess what the accuracy requirements on these parameters are , and whether it will be possible to extract the parameters to those required accuracies on a sufficiently regular basis .",
    "the variation of the misalignment over the course of the mission is not yet well defined and is currently under investigation .",
    "it is , however , expected that the frequency at which the roll and effective boresight angles must be evaluated will be of the order of once a week @xcite .    in section  [ section_acc_req ] the accuracy requirements of the effective boresight angle and the roll angle , the rotation of the focal plane , are discussed .",
    "methods of evaluating the roll and effective boresight angles through the use of galactic and extragalactic point sources are discussed in section  [ section_methods ] .",
    "the number of both galactic and extragalactic point sources likely to be detectable by _ planck _ are discussed in section  [ pt_sources_section ] .",
    "the simulated data on which our methods are tested is discussed in section  [ section_simdata ] , the results of which are discussed in section  [ section_results ] .",
    "( 7,7)(0,0 ) ( 8.5,0 )    the effect of unknown random pointing reconstruction errors on the recovered @xmath1 values may be seen in figure  [ acc_fig ] .",
    "this figure has been replicated from one first shown by  @xcite , using equation  [ c_ell_eqn ] modified from  @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the noise per beam , @xmath4 is the fractional sky coverage and @xmath5 is the window function .",
    "the sensitivity of an experiment to the @xmath6 multipoles is given by its window function .",
    "for a map made with a gaussian beam , the window function is given by : @xmath7 .",
    "if the beam sigma , @xmath8 , is known , the decreased sensitivity to the higher @xmath6 multipoles may be accounted for by multiplying by the window function .",
    "it is this which results in the exponential increase in the noise for the high multipoles in figure  [ acc_fig ] , as the noise is undiminished by the beam size . for low multipoles",
    "the noise is dominated by the first term in equation  [ c_ell_eqn ] which expresses the sample and cosmic variance .",
    "figure  [ acc_fig ] uses the expected beam size and noise levels for the 217 ghz frequency channel and assumes 70 per cent sky coverage .",
    "the grey curves enclose regions corresponding to the unsubtractable noise , given by equation  [ c_ell_eqn ] .",
    "the solid grey curves correspond to the error on each individual multipole , while the dashed grey curves the error on multipole bins of width 50 .    the black curves , in figure  [ acc_fig ] , correspond to the additional errors in the reconstruction of the @xmath0s due to the effects of unknown random pointing errors .",
    "this results in a decreased sensitivity to the higher @xmath6 multipoles as is seen in figure  [ acc_fig ] .",
    "the pointing uncertainty results in an effective smearing of the beam and hence an increase in the effective beam width .",
    "if this is well known , a new window function may be evaluated and the effects of the pointing errors will not be as dramatic as those shown .",
    "however , in reality the pointing errors will be correlated , smearing the beam more in one direction , which will lead to asymmetric effective beams .",
    "the effect of smearing the beam predominately in one direction is to increase the sensitivity to higher @xmath6 multipoles as compared to the uniform smearing shown infigure  [ acc_fig ] . in other words , for a given magnitude , correlated pointing errors will lead to a smaller reduction in sensitivity at high @xmath6 , than random pointing errors .",
    "however , given that the extent of the correlation of the pointing errors is not known and that the reduction in the maximum allowable pointing error is only significant for highly correlated pointing errors , the pointing errors are assummed to be random in the subsequent analysis .",
    "ideally , the pointing accuracy should be such that the additional errors introduced are less than the unsubtractable noise .    for each frequency channel , with the exception of 857 ghz in which the @xmath0s are not observable ,",
    "the unsubtractable errors on the @xmath0s , given the expected beam size and noise levels , were evaluated .",
    "hence , the ideal pointing accuracy required for each frequency channel may be found . these are shown in table  [ pt_acc_table ] , for the cases of 70 and 100 percent sky coverage .",
    ".the requirement on the random pointing error versus frequency channel , given fractional sky coverage , @xmath4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     tables  [ sinusoidal_ss_err_wk_min ] and  [ sinusoidal_ss_err_wk_ave ] show the effect of the increased requirements on the accuracy of the roll angle , on the variations in the weekly minimum and average values of the number of available point sources over the various sinusoidal scanning strategies . in table",
    "[ sinusoidal_ss_err_wk_min ] the minimum value of the weekly minimum drops below one for the requirement that the error in the roll angle , @xmath9 , is @xmath10 .",
    "the average value of the weekly minimum is less than one for the requirement that @xmath9 is @xmath11 . in this table",
    "the value of the roll angle is zero , which we have earlier established is the value of the roll angle with the greatest number of point sources available for its recovery .",
    "it is therefore desirable that the limit of the error on the roll angle is as large as possible in order to increase the range in the values of roll angles for which there may be a weekly reconstruction of the roll angle .",
    "we have shown here , in section  [ subsec_one_ring ] , that the roll angle can not be evaluated using data from a single ring .",
    "the cross - scan position of a point source can not be evaluated before the roll angle has been found as the cross - scan positions of the detectors are unknown .",
    "the cross - scan position of a point source can , however , be evaluated using data from a single ring , once the roll angle is known .",
    "the cross - scan position of a point source may also be evaluated by an extension to the method used to reconstruct the roll angle from two neighbouring rings , as discussed in section  [ two_rings ] .",
    "the evaluation of the cross - scan position using two rings is immune to the relative calibration errors between the detectors , but the area available to this method is the same as the area available for the reconstruction of the roll angle ; where the area available depends on both the signal - to - noise ratio of the point source and on the actual value of the roll angle . in comparison",
    "the area available to the extraction of the cross - scan position from a single ring is only dependent on the value of the roll angle , through its effect on the cross - scan positions of the detectors . in order to extract its cross - scan position ,",
    "the point source must lie within the range of the cross - scan positions of the detectors .",
    "this criterion leads to an opposite dependence on the roll angle , as compared to the two ring method ; the area available increases with the magnitude of the roll angle , with the minimum value occuring at zero roll angle .",
    "the main components of the error in the effective boresight are the error in the recovered cross - scan position and the error in the position of the point source .",
    "the error in the effective boresight affects the requirement on the roll angle error in order that the resultant error in the pointing meets the requirements as found in section  [ section_acc_req ] .",
    "the less stringent the requirements on the roll angle error , the greater the range in the roll angle which may be reliably reconstructed on a weekly basis .",
    "it is therefore possible to place requirements on the radial error in the position of the point source used in the evaluation of the effective boresight .",
    "using typical values of the error in the recovered cross - scan position , it is found that in order to meet the pointing requirement , the radial position error should be less than 10 .",
    "ideally the radial error should be @xmath123 in order to reduce the requirements on the recovery of the roll angle .",
    "we have investigated methods for the evaluation of parameters required for the pointing reconstruction of the _ planck _ satellite .",
    "the effect of pointing errors on the recovered @xmath0s has been assessed and requirements on the accuracy of the pointing reconstruction found , such that the effect of random pointing errors is less than the unsubtractable noise .",
    "the accuracy at which the roll angle is required is determined so that the uncertainty in the positions of the detectors due to the error in the roll angle is less than the limit on the pointing error .",
    "it is found that it is impractical to determine the roll angle from data from a single ring , as this would require an extremely high signal - to - noise ratio point source to successfully determine the roll angle .",
    "an alternative method using two neighbouring rings was developed , which allows the successful extraction of the roll angle to the required accuracy from a single point source , with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath13 .",
    "this method also has the additional advantage of using the ratio of the amplitudes of a point source as seen by the same detector on different rings , hence this method does not require the relative calibration of the detectors .",
    "this method , however , does rely upon the assumption that the roll angle is a slowly varying parameter , and it should be remembered that any abrupt changes to the inertia tensor will invalidate this assumption . once the roll angle is determined the cross scan position of any point source may be assessed .",
    "the effective boresight angle may then be evaluated using the cross scan position of a point source of known position .    due to the depletion of consumables over the course of the mission and the resultant variation in the values of the pointing parameters",
    ", these parameters should be evaluated on a regular basis . whether a method may be applied successfully on a regular basis ,",
    "will depend on the availability of suitable point sources over the course of the mission . in order to investigate this availability , the number of galactic and extragalactic point sources detectable by the _ planck _",
    "mission was determined .",
    "it was found that there is an insufficient number of suitable extragalactic point sources to evaluate these parameters , the roll and effective boresight angles , on a weekly basis .",
    "hence the number of galactic point sources available is crucial .",
    "the total number of galactic point sources observable by _ planck _ over the course of the mission , and more importantly the variation in the number observable on a weekly basis , depends upon the scanning strategy used .",
    "however , it was found that it was not possible to recommend a scanning strategy which will maximise the number of galactic point sources available .",
    "this is due to other constraints on the scanning strategy such as maintaining the earth aspect angle @xmath1415@xmath15 within the l2 orbit .",
    "the number of point sources available is also found to depend on the value of the roll angle .",
    "the method , presented here for the reconstruction of the roll angle from two neighbouring rings , is best suited for the evaluation of small magnitude roll angles .",
    "the larger the roll angle , the smaller the number of point sources available and the greater the chance of weeks with no suitable point sources . for roll angles @xmath16@xmath15 and @xmath17@xmath15 it is likely that there will be an occasional week in which there is no suitable point source to evaluate the roll angle .",
    "as the magnitude of the roll angle increases above these values the number of suitable point sources diminishes until @xmath18@xmath15 and @xmath19@xmath15 where the evaluation of the roll angle using the method presented here is no longer possible .",
    "this places a manufacturing requirement on the alignment of the focal plane with respect to the nominal scan direction .    while the evaluation of the roll angle does not require a known point source",
    ", the reconstruction of the effective boresight requires the position of the point source to be known .",
    "a known point source catalogue will therefore be required for the evaluation of the effective boresight angles , with positional errors less than 7 and ideally less than 2 , in order to meet the accuracy requirements on the pointing parameters .",
    "given the success of this method depends on the numbers of bright point sources available , and for the reconstruction of the effective boresight on their accurate positions , it is important that the iras sources which are found here to be potentially suitable for the reconstruction of these parameters are observed prior to launch , to confirm their point source nature , to improve upon their flux estimates and acquire accurate positions .",
    "any point source @xmath20 times the noise expected in a binned ring in the 857 ghz channel is potentially useful in evaluating these parameters . given the expected noise level this corresponds to point sources @xmath21  jy at 857 ghz .",
    "the method presented here will allow the weekly monitoring of the roll angle , given the number of point sources determined here , under the expectation of small roll angles and a slowly varying inertia tensor . when combined with a catalogue of accurate point source positions",
    ", this method will also allow the weekly determination of the effective boresight angle .",
    "it is expected that the determinations of these two angles from the science data will be used to determine their systematic offsets from the equivalent angles determined more accurately by the star tracker .",
    "we would like to thank the following members of the london planck anaylsis centre for helpful conversations : steve serjeant , luis mendes and dave clements .",
    "we would also like to thank dave clements and luis mendes for reading the manuscript .",
