    "according to the recent astronomical data from type ia supernovae @xcite as well as from the cmb spectrum @xcite , it is well known that our universe is experiencing an accelerating expanded phase . in order to comply with this feature , dark energy content for the universe",
    "is assumed @xcite within the framework of the general relativity ( gr ) , having undesired properties such as the violation of some energy conditions .",
    "nowadays , it is a well - known fact that modifying the law of gravity leads to possible explanations for the acceleration mechanism of the universe @xcite .",
    "various modified theory are proposed , one assumed as an algebraic function of the curvature @xmath12 , the so - called @xmath13 theory of gravity @xcite , other as an algebraic function for both the curvature and the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath14 @xcite.the recent and interesting kind of modified theory of gravity is the one base on the torsion scalar , as algebraic function of this later , denoted by @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the modified theory of gravity undertaken in this paper , called @xmath0 , is a modified version of the teleparallel ( tt ) essential based on the torsion scalar @xmath1 . in this way , the torsion , as the tt term",
    ", is replaced by an algebraic function of the torsion , and this , always in the optic to comply with the cosmological data . in this paper , we are interested in the cosmological behavior of realistic models of modified gravity describing the de sitter epoch of the current universe . as a check , we will study homogeneous perturbations around the de sitter solution of the dark energy density , to see whether we are able to regain the well known results .",
    "note that the analysis is possible only the explicit form of the algebraic function is known .",
    "we therefore consider an exponential form of @xmath0 .",
    "remember that this kind of model is well - known is the framework of @xmath13 @xcite , where the cosmological evolution has been explored .",
    "more precisely in the framework of @xmath0 theory of gravity , bamba and collaborators considered an exponential model and studied cosmological evolutions of the equation of state for dark energy .",
    "they result shows that the crossing of the phantom divide line of @xmath15 may be observed when a logarithmic correction is performed to the exponential model . in the paper @xcite",
    ", it is shown that for @xmath16 is pure - imaginary , the model is unstable .",
    "also , it is shown that the model defined by the equation ( 39 ) is stable if @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , in a work developed by bamba and collaborators , it has been shown that the model ( 39 ) of our paper should not produce  finite time singularities \" @xcite .",
    "the well known of finite time singularities is the big - rip .",
    "note that the big - rip appears only in the phantom phase .",
    "therefore , the model under consideration here may just reproduce a quintessence universe , meaning that the greater value of the effective parameter of equation of state is @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    ", we still obey these features of the considered model , considering the suitable values of the parameter @xmath18 as pointed out in @xcite , and try to check whether such a model should describe the de sitter stage of our current universe .",
    "this paper can be view as an extension of these cited paper , still in the optic to point out the how much this the exponential @xmath0 model can be assumed as a viable one .",
    "to do so , we perform a perturbation around the de sitter point and such for the behaviour of the perturbation function @xmath19 .",
    "we see that as the low red - shifts are being reached , the perturbation parameter goes to zero .",
    "this means that the exponential @xmath0 can describe the de sitter stage only for low red - shift .",
    "it is why for our study in this paper , we limit the values of @xmath2 to the lowest ones .",
    "it is can be view from our results that the behaviour of the parameter of the equation of state related to the dark energy is the same as in the bamba s paper @xcite , despite of using different values of the parameter @xmath18 belonging to the interval imposed by @xcite . also , in this paper , within suitable values of the input parameters we plot the cosmological parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 and also the behaviour of the perturbation function @xmath19 .",
    "our results perfectly fit with the cosmological observational data and more precisely , for the low - redshift , the function @xmath19 goes towards zero whereas @xmath21 tends to @xmath3 , showing the stability of the model under consideration around the de sitter solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in @xmath22 we present the generality on @xmath0 , putting up the general equation of motion and its associated generalized friedmann equations from which all the analysis are realized .",
    "the @xmath23 is devoted for obtaining the general scale factor according to the model .",
    "the conclusion and perspective are presented in the last section .",
    "the modified theory of gravity based on the torsion scalar is the one for which the geometric part of the action is an algebraic function depending on the torsion . in the same way as in the teleparallel gravity ,",
    "the geometric elements are described using orthonormal tetrads components defined in the tangent space at each point of the manifold . in general the line element",
    "can be written as @xmath24 where we define the following elements @xmath25 note that @xmath26 is the metric related to the minkowskian spacetime and the @xmath27 are the components of the tetrad which satisfy the following identity @xmath28 the connection in use in this theory is the one of weizenbock s , defined by @xmath29 once the previous connection is assumed , one can then expression the main geometric objects ; the torsion tensor s components as@xmath30 which is used in the definition of the contorsion tensor as @xmath31 the above objects ( torsion and contorsion ) are used to define a new tensor @xmath32 as @xmath33 the torsion scalar is defined from the previous tensor and the torsion tensor as @xmath34    let us write the action for the modified @xmath0 theory with matter as follows @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36=\\sqrt{-g}$ ] denotes the determinant of the tetrad , and @xmath37 the determinant of the space - time metric and the algebraic function @xmath0 is assumed as the sum of the teleparallel gravity term ( the torsion scalar @xmath1 ) , and an additive algebraic function @xmath38 as @xmath39 but for the instance we will continue working in the general scheme using the algebraic function @xmath0 , having in view that the additive function @xmath38 has to be used later .    by varying eq .",
    "@xmath40 with respect to the tetrad , one gets the following general equation of motion @xcite ,    @xmath41f_{t}+ \\frac{1}{4}\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\mu}f=\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{2 } \\mathcal{t}^{\\nu}_{\\mu } ,   \\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 denotes the stress tensor such that @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 being the energy density and the pressure of ordinary content of the universe respectively and @xmath46 , the four - velocity such that @xmath47 . still with the considered signature ( + , -,-,- ) , we assume the line element for the flat robertson - walker universe as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the universe scalar factor .",
    "therefore , the torsion scalar is performed giving @xmath50    from eq.@xmath51 , and using ( [ 4 ] ) , one gets the following gravitational field equations : @xmath52 @xmath53 here the  dot \" denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath54 , @xmath55 , the hubble parameter and @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the matter energy - density and pressure , respectively .",
    "the matter conservation equation reads @xmath56 by assuming that the matter content is a perfect fluid , the pressure and the energy density are related by the barotropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath57 where @xmath16 is the eos - parameter for matter . for standard matter ( non - relativist matter ) ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 , whereas for radiation ( relativist matter ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "now , making use of the relation @xmath62 , one can write the eqs.@xmath63 as functions of the effective energy density , @xmath64 , and effective pressure , @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67,\\\\   \\label{13 }   p_{eff } & = & p+\\frac{1}{\\kappa^{2}}\\left[f(t)+4\\left({\\dot h}+3h^{2}\\right)f_{t}(t)+4h{\\dot t}f_{tt}(t)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us define the dark energy density @xmath68 as @xmath69 and introduce the variable @xmath70 where , @xmath71 is the energy density of matter at present time , @xmath72 being the mass scale @xmath73 and @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the current radiation density ,",
    "@xmath2 the redshift parameter , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , written as a function of @xmath2 . the eos parameter for the dark energy , @xmath20 , is written as @xmath79 by combining eq.@xmath80 with eq.@xmath81 and using eq.@xmath82 , one gets @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 the torsion scalar can be written in function of the red - shift as @xmath86 where we used @xmath87 . by taking the trace form of eq .",
    "@xmath88 in the vacuum , one gets the following equation @xmath89 since we are considering the de sitter universe , the torsion has to be taken as the de sitter one , known as a constant , because of the constance of the hubble parameter , such that the trace equation becomes @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the de sitter torsion scalar .",
    "now , in order to check how much our model deviates from the de sitter one , say , checking it convergence to the de sitter model , we study perturbations around the de sitter solution of the dark energy density . then , we write the following equation @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a constant and the stability requires @xmath94 .",
    "eq.@xmath95 leads to @xmath96 in this case , by neglecting the contribution of radiation and taking into account only the non - relativist matter contribution , but assumed to be much smaller than @xmath97 , eq.@xmath98 becomes @xmath99 where @xmath100 @xmath101    here we have performed the variation of eq.@xmath102 with respect to @xmath1 , and also have used eq.@xmath103 .",
    "the solution of eq.@xmath104 is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is an integration constant .    as a check for our approach ,",
    "let us now consider an exponential model , to see the behaviour of the dark energy . in this paper , we assume the following exponential model ; @xmath107 .",
    "note that this model has been early used by bamba and collaborators in @xcite where they studied the cosmological evolutions of the equation of state for dark energy .",
    "they showed that the crossing of the phantom divide line of @xmath15 can be realized by combining to the exponential model a logarithmic one .",
    "in this section , our goal is just to check the convergence of the exponential model to the de sitter one . in this way",
    ", we have    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the scalar tensor at present time , with @xmath110 , and @xmath111 . by considering @xmath112 , and using eq  ( [ 24 ] ) within the expansion of the exponential function , one gets the following expression for the de sitter torsion @xmath113 in order to reach to an interesting physical result , among other conditions",
    ", we assume the case where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",

    "[ fig2 ] * from the equation ( [ 25 ] ) , we obtain the corresponding expression of @xmath118 as @xmath119 the graphs representing the evolution of this function are plotted at the fig . *",
    "[ fig1]*. here , we just try to show what happens at the low - redshift level .",
    "it can be observed that as the lowest redshift are being reached , i.e , @xmath120 , the curves at the right hand side seem to go toward zero .",
    "this is just the effect for having used a very large interval , i.e , @xmath121 - 1,+\\infty[$ ] because , indeed , at the level of low - redshift the curved tend to some values different from zero .    within the above expression",
    ", we perform the ones of the parameters of equation of state of the dark energy @xmath20 and the effective @xmath21 as @xmath122},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose the graphs representatives are plotted respectively at fig . * [ fig3 ] * and fig . *",
    "[ fig4 ] * .",
    "we see from the fig . * [ fig3 ] * that as the lowest redshift are being reached , the parameter @xmath20 tends to @xmath3 for the values of the input parameters @xmath18 and @xmath123 .",
    "the same is almost obtained for the effective parameter of eos @xmath21 showing for any of the considered values of the input parameters @xmath18 , the curves go toward @xmath3 .",
    "this is an interesting result .",
    "note that the effective parameter @xmath21 is the one that characterizes the whole content of the universe .",
    "also , it is well known that the de sitter universe is the one for which one has @xmath124 . therefore , due to fact that @xmath125 for @xmath120",
    ", one can conclude that within the exponential @xmath0 model , the de sitter stage of the universe is realized for the lowest values of the redshift .",
    "this result completely agrees with the one obtained by bamba and collaborators @xcite where they showed within others values of the input parameters that the parameter @xmath20 goes toward @xmath3 as the lowest redshift are being reached @xmath120 with an exponential @xmath0 model . in our case , due to the fact that we approximate the dark energy to the effective content of the universe , it is obvious that our result is in agreement with the one of @xcite .",
    "we point out that our study is just about low red - shift .",
    "note that as the title mentions , we are interested to see whether the exponential model should describe the de sitter stage of our current universe . therefore , we just have to limit our analysis to the low .",
    "this king of study is in the same way as the well know @xmath126 model , which works only for the current times .",
    "it is well known that for early times , @xmath126 model does not work .",
    "the spirit is just the same here .",
    "we just our study to the low red - shift because knowing that this can not lead any interesting result for high red - shift .",
    "our goal in this section in to obtain the expression of the scale factor for with , at the level of low - redshift , the standard de sitter expression may be recovered . to do this ,",
    "let us consider the eqs.@xmath127 and @xmath128 in the case where @xmath129 is a positive real number : @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath106 is a constant .",
    "we will assume @xmath132 .",
    "from the first equation of motion @xmath133 , one gets @xmath134 and the explicit expression of @xmath135 depending on cosmic time @xmath54 may be obtained . by substituting @xmath136 by @xmath137 ,",
    "one gets @xmath138 in the previous expression we have neglected the matter contribution .",
    "now by considering @xmath139 , the general solution for the expanding universe is @xmath140^{\\frac{2}{\\gamma}},\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is a positive constant .",
    "the above expression can be rewritten , given @xmath142^{\\frac{2}{\\gamma}},\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the value of the scalar factor @xmath49 at @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , the hubble parameter gives @xmath146 the interesting feature here is to observe that , as @xmath147 , for the the redshifts reaching the low possible ones , i.e , @xmath120 , the scale factor becomes @xmath148 , and for @xmath139 , @xmath149 .",
    "these results , once again confirm that the de sitter stage of the current dark energy dominated universe may be described for the lowest values for the redshift .",

    "in this paper , we consider the modified theory of gravity based on the torsion scalar , as the generalized version of the tt , where we assume an exponential model for the action .",

    "what has to be checked is whether within the exponential model , the perturbation @xmath19 function may vanish or converge toward a value whose the magnitude should be very less than 1 .    according to our results , the perturbation function @xmath19 converges and goes toward zero as the lowest values ( @xmath162 ) are approached .",
    "as it is well known , for the de sitter universe , the parameter of the effective equation of motion is @xmath3 . beside to the interesting convergence of the perturbation function",
