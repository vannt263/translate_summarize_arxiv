    "pursuit of quantitative stellar spectroscopy not infrequently introduces new puzzles as old puzzles are probed .",
    "recent determinations of the solar photospheric abundances of carbon and oxygen exemplify this claim . in a thorough review of light element photospheric abundances , holweger ( 2001 )",
    "recommends the abundances @xmath2(c ) = 8.592 @xmath3 , and @xmath2(o ) = 8.736 @xmath4 0.078 on the usual scale with @xmath2(h ) = 12.0 .",
    "these results based on 1d nlte analyses of permitted lines of ci and oi include corrections for the effects of solar granulation based on 2d modeling .",
    "prior to holweger s reassessment , the accepted carbon abundance was lower ( @xmath2(c ) = 8.52 @xmath4 0.06 ) and that of oxygen higher ( @xmath2(o ) = 8.83 @xmath4 0.06 ; grevesse & sauval 1998 ) . with the reassessment , the carbon - to - oxygen ratio is increased .",
    "more intriguingly , the errors assigned to the new solar abundances would formally allow a carbon - to - oxygen ratio greater than one .",
    "such a ratio is exceedingly puzzling in that it implies remarkable abundance differences between the photosphere and the corona , the outer planets , and unevolved stars and interstellar gas in the solar neighborhood . lowering the oxygen abundance and keeping the high value for the carbon abundance leads also to a conflict with the strength of observed water and methane bands in the spectra of very cool stars ( tsuji 2002 ) . recognizing the controlling influence of the co molecule on the partial pressures of carbon and oxygen , the simple observation of very weak c@xmath5 bands and strong tio bands in sunspot spectra shows that the carbon - to - oxygen ratio must be less than unity . yet , a precise determination of the photospheric ratio is of great interest .    in this paper",
    ", we reconsider the carbon abundance provided by the forbidden carbon line at 8727  .",
    "our reanalysis follows our successful study of the forbidden oxygen line at 6300  , which gave the abundance @xmath2(o ) = 8.69 @xmath4 0.05 with a 3d hydrodynamical model photosphere simulating the solar granulation ( allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2001a ) .",
    "the principal advantages of a forbidden line over permitted lines are twofold : ( i ) the line s @xmath6-value is most probably more accurately known than the @xmath6-values of the permitted lines , and ( ii ) the line is formed very close to lte , which is not true for the permitted lines .",
    "we argue that the possible downsides with the [ ci ] line , namely its relative weakness and possible blends , can be adequately addressed .",
    "our line profile calculations follow very closely those of allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2001a ) for the [ oi ] line at 6300  .",
    "we used a three - dimensional time - dependent hydrodynamical simulation of the solar surface as a model atmosphere ( asplund et al .",
    "2000a and references therein ) .",
    "the calculated flux profiles for the forbidden [ ci ] line at 8727.1   and a sii line at 8728   result from the average of a time sequence of flux profiles computed from 100 snapshots , which are equally spaced over 50 minutes of solar time . for each snapshot ,",
    "the integration over the solar disk makes use of intensity profiles for @xmath7 angles , accounting for the ( solid body @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ) rotational broadening ( dravins & nordlund 1990 ) .",
    "the uppsala opacity package ( gustafsson et al .",
    "1975 with subsequent updates ) was the source of the continuum opacities , partition functions , ionization potentials , and other basic data for the line synthesis as well as for the simulation .",
    "collisional broadening was evaluated using the unsld s approximation ( unsld 1955 ) for the [ ci ] line and the neighboring sii line .",
    "the [ ci ] 8727.1   line was identified in the solar spectrum by lambert & swings ( 1967a ) .",
    "they remarked upon a potential blending line of fei , but deemed its contribution to be negligible .",
    "kurucz ( 1993 ) calculated @xmath10 for this iron line , which leads to an equivalent width of @xmath11 m .",
    "kurucz also calculated the transition probabilities for the other 5 lines in the multiplet , and four of them appear in the solar spectrum .",
    "using the measured equivalent widths ( @xmath12 m ) to scale the @xmath13 s of these four lines , we estimate an equivalent width of @xmath14 m values . ] .",
    "nave et al . ( 1994 ) in a thorough reinvestigation of the laboratory fei spectrum did not list the fei line with its predicted wavelength of 8727.130  , but four stronger lines of the same multiplet were measured .",
    "three of the four measured lines appear relatively unblended in the solar spectrum . normalizing the line strengths measured by nave et al . to the relative ls - coupling strengths",
    ", we can scale the observed equivalent widths and obtain a third estimate of the equivalent width of the 8727.130   line : @xmath15 m .",
    "given that the solar feature has an equivalent width of about 6 m , the fei contribution is very small and can be neglected .",
    "gustafsson et al . ( 1999 ) eliminate the cn red system as another contributor of a blend .",
    "the predicted [ ci ] rest wavelength is 8727.126   with an uncertainty of about 0.015   ( moore 1993 ) .",
    "after correction for the gravitational redshift , the center of the feature in the solar spectrum is observed at @xmath16 (as determined with the method described in allende prieto et al .",
    "2002 ) . for weak lines ,",
    "we expect a significant convective blueshift ( allende prieto & garca lpez 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the predicted wavelength is likely to be in error by as much as its full quoted uncertainty .",
    "different calculations report results for the einstein @xmath17-value which have converged to @xmath17 = 0.640 s@xmath9 or @xmath13 = @xmath188.136  see galavis et al .",

    "this scan has a spectral resolving power in excess of half a million , and a maximum signal - to - noise of 2600 .",
    "the sii line dominates the shape of the local continuum in the region of the [ ci ] line .",
    "the abundance of silicon has been recently studied using the same 3d model atmosphere employed here ( asplund 2000 ) .",
    "recent 1d nlte calculations suggest that photospheric sii lines are not much affected by departures from lte ( wedemeyer 2001 ) . since the line s @xmath6-value is uncertain , we considered the factor @xmath21 $ ] and a multiplicative correction to the local continuum level as free parameters with which to adjust the continuum in the vicinity of the [ ci ] line .",
    "a variation in the central wavelength of the sii line has a similar effect as a change in the strength of the line .",
    "the velocity shift between kitt peak national observatory and the sun at the time of the observations has been corrected typically within several m s@xmath9 , but other factors ( setting of frequency scale in fts , conversion to air wavelengths , correction of individual scans with partial wavelength coverage , change of velocity shift over long integrations , etc . )",
    "can degrade the absolute accuracy of the wavelength scale up to 0.1 km s@xmath9 ( kurucz et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the gravitational redshift for photospheric photons intercepted at earth is @xmath22 km s@xmath9 .",
    "seasonal variations produced by the ellipticity of earth s orbit are about 0.1 m s@xmath9 , earth s surface gravity induces a correction of about 0.2 m s@xmath9 , and uncertainties in the solar radius and @xmath23 can hamper @xmath24 by about 0.3 m s@xmath9 .",
    "we are using a hydrodynamical model atmosphere which has been shown to predict the convective shifts of photospheric lines of weak and moderate strength within 0.1 km s@xmath9 ( asplund et al . 2000a ) .",
    "therefore , we should be able to predict the measured wavelength of the [ ci ] with an uncertainty of about 0.15 km s@xmath9 ( @xmath25  ) , an estimate significantly smaller than for moore s wavelength .",
    "we consequently adjust the wavelength of the line to best match the observations .",
    "we proceed to compare our calculated profiles to the solar observations adopting different values for the wavelength of the forbidden line @xmath26}$ ] . for each adopted @xmath26}$ ] , we minimize the @xmath27 between the observed and calculated spectra by changing the abundance of carbon @xmath28 , a multiplicative correction factor to the local continuum , and @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "there are obvious blends on both sides of the [ ci ] line .",
    "the line at 8726.8   is a cn line ( gustafsson et al .",
    "1999 ) , but other lines are unidentified .",
    "we believe there are no blends within the [ ci ] profile , but , if we are in error , the determined carbon abundance is an upper limit .",
    "first , we fitted 1   around the [ ci ] feature , between 8726.6 and 8727.6   in the solar atlas , using the nelder - mead simplex method ( nelder & mead 1965 ; press et al .",
    "we obtain the best fit , illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , for @xmath29 dex .",
    "we emphasize that the fit is achieved without invoking micro- or macroturbulence ; the line profile is predicted from the convective flows without additional parameters . by selecting a narrow interval excluding the core of the sii blending line , we are in effect adjusting the line s damping constant to get the optimum fit to the wing around the [ ci ] line ; the line depth in a damping wing scales as the product of the abundance and the damping constant .",
    "next , we repeated the experiment for a more restricted wavelength interval , between 8726.9 and 8727.25  . the carbon abundance changed by less than 0.01 dex , the multiplicative factor to adjust the continuum level changed by only 0.0003 , and the best values for the wavelength of the [ ci ] by less than 0.001  .",
    "our best fit yielded a reduced @xmath27 ( 37 frequencies and 4 degrees of freedom ) of 0.87 , and , therefore , the chance probability for this is @xmath30 .",
    "these figures are based on the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath31 derived by examination of an apparently clean segment of the spectrum around 8731.7  .",
    "2 shows the variation of the reduced @xmath27 and the carbon abundance as a function of the central wavelength for the the [ ci ] transition , when the more restricted wavelength interval is considered .",
    "the rest wavelength of the [ ci ] line that minimizes the @xmath27 is @xmath32  , after correction for the gravitational redshift .",
    "the synthetic spectra predict a blueshift of about 0.25 km s@xmath9 for the line , i.e. , a laboratory wavelength of 8727.146  .",
    "this differs from moore s wavelength of 8727.126   obtained not from laboratory measurements of the line but from ultraviolet lines connecting the ground configuration levels to excited levels . in the introductory remarks to her table of ci energy levels , she draws attention to kaufman & ward s ( 1966 ) revisions of ultraviolet wavelengths which imply revised energies for the ground configuration .",
    "these revisions predict a wavelength of 8727.141   in good agreement with our solar - based wavelength , even though the uncertainty remains at about 0.01  .",
    "the internal uncertainty in the fit for the carbon abundance can be estimated as 0.01 dex by confronting the expected accuracy in @xmath26}$ ] ( 0.004  , which includes the observational share of the error ) , with fig .",
    "2 . judging from the scatter in the most recently calculated @xmath33values , the derived carbon abundance is hardly affected by this factor ( @xmath34 \\simeq 0.005 $ ] dex ) .",
    "other systematic errors may arise from the uncertainties in the adopted continuum opacities , equation of state , etc .",
    ", probably about 0.02 dex . finally , if the contribution of the fei line discussed in  2 to the observed absorption is close to the lower limit of our estimates , the effect on the derived carbon abundance is truly negligible , but if it is close to the upper limit , that could decrease @xmath28 by @xmath35 dex .",
    "conservatively , we derive @xmath36 dex .",
    "as shown by strenburg & holweger ( 1990 ) , the forbidden line at 8727.1   is immune to departures from lte , and therefore our lte calculation of the line formation in a 3d lte model is likely to provide a reliable abundance .",
    "it is interesting to compare our 3d result to a standard analysis using one - dimensional model atmospheres .",

    "( 2001b ) , and the micro- and macro - turbulence derived with the model ( @xmath37 km s@xmath9 , macro=1.54 km s@xmath9 ) , leads to @xmath38 dex , the holweger - mller model gives @xmath39 dex , and a flux - constant marcs model atmosphere @xmath40 dex .",
    "our determination of the solar carbon abundance ( @xmath41 ) from the forbidden line at 8727.1   is lower than the most recent estimates based on this line .",
    "our lower abundance is mainly caused for two reasons : a revised @xmath42value ( @xmath43 dex ) , and the use of a 3d model atmosphere ( @xmath44 dex ) .",
    "other indicators of the solar photospheric carbon abundance are available .",
    "ci , ch , and c@xmath5 lines have received significant attention in the literature and suggest , when analyzed with empirical or theoretical 1d model atmospheres , higher abundances than our determination from the [ c i ] line ( see , e.g. grevesse et al .",
    "1991 ) . pending a full reanalysis with the 3d model",
    ", we note that the c abundance from the molecular lines will be reduced in the change from a 1d to 3d model due to the high temperature sensitivity of molecule formation and the presence of cooler gas in the 3d model ( asplund & garca prez 2001 ) . to assess the effect on the ci lines , we selected the weakest and least blended 13 lines in overlapping lists of solar lines used previously by bimont et al .",

    "nlte 3d calculations are not available , but if the 1d corrections for nlte effects from strenburg & holweger are adopted , the abundance is lowered to @xmath2(c ) = 8.42 @xmath4 0.06 , a value in harmony with our result from the [ ci ] line .",
    "our preliminary conclusion is that the lower carbon abundance is not contradicted by other indicators .    combining the updated solar abundances of carbon and oxygen from the forbidden lines , we obtain a number - density ratio c / o@xmath1 .",

    "revision of the solar c and o abundances using their forbidden lines brings these abundances into line with recent results for b stars and the orion nebula .",
    "one may speculate that this close correspondence in compositions may extend to other elements , for example , nitrogen , through revisions to either the solar , stellar or nebular abundances .",
    "unfortunately , the [ ni ] lines are too weak for positive identification in the solar spectrum ( lambert & swings 1967b ) .",
