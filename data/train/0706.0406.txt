    "the question of mode in evolution , especially in the context of speciation has engaged the attention of many evolutionists for over a century and continues to do so @xcite .",
    "the issue is whether evolution occurs by smooth gradual changes ( gradualism ) as put forwarded by darwin , or sudden large jumps ( punctuationism ) @xcite .",
    "some examinations of fossil record indicate that new species can arise by either mode , or even by a combination of the two @xcite .",
    "however , a complete and unambiguous answer is hard to obtain at the level of macroevolution due to the incompleteness and irreproducibility of the fossil data . in the last decade or so , researchers have become interested in carrying out long - term evolution experiments in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "typically one starts with a microbial population maladapted to a given environment such as a colony of starving bacteria , and track its evolutionary trajectories for thousands of generations as it undergoes adaptive changes .",
    "the results of such experiments have been found to be consistent with both modes of evolution .",
    "for instance , large populations of rna virus starting from a low fitness ancestor have been seen to gain fitness in a continuous manner @xcite . on the other hand , the fitness of bacteria _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite and rna virus @xmath1 @xcite show a punctuated pattern of evolution .",
    "theoretically , these results are understood using the concept of fitness landscape @xcite defined as a map from the genotypic space into the real numbers . if the fitness landscape is smooth and single - peaked , starting from a low fitness state the population fitness increases gradually until it has reached the peak value @xcite .",
    "the dynamics are different for a population moving on a rugged fitness landscape with multiple peaks @xcite . in this case , the population fitness increases smoothly until the population encounters a local fitness peak where it gets trapped as a better peak is separated by a fitness valley .",
    "the population thus enters the stasis phase and waits until a favorable mutation allows it to shift to a better peak where it can again get localised and so on .",
    "thus , the dynamics alternate between periods of _ stasis _ and rapid changes in fitness when the population _ jumps _ from a peak to an even better one .",
    "an example of this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ example ] .    ) and the fitness of the most populated genotype ( @xmath2 ) in a single realization of a maximally rugged fitness landscape . here",
    "@xmath3 . ]",
    "that the fitness landscape underlying the evolutionary process is multi - peaked is supported by several experiments @xcite .",
    "besides , these landscapes include biologically important and ubiquitous epistatic interactions @xcite as the contribution of individual genes to the fitness of the genotype is not independent @xcite .",
    "the class of landscapes considered in this work are maximally rugged and characterised by strong selection @xcite . in statistical physics ,",
    "such rugged landscapes with a large number of local optima have appeared in the context of spin glass theory .",
    "examples include random energy model @xcite and sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite where the energy of a spin configuration plays the role of genotypic fitness and the metastability in the spin glass dynamics can be viewed as punctuated equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the statistics of jumps which occur when the population fitness changes rapidly . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ example ] , an unambiguous way of defining a jump at time @xmath4 is the change in the fitness or identity of the _ most populated genotype _ at @xmath4 .",
    "the problem of such leadership changes arises in several other contexts such as change in the position of the optimal end point of directed polymer @xcite , highest degree node in a growing network @xcite , and velocity and position of the front particle in a single - file system @xcite . in the following sections , before analysing the realistic case of finite populations",
    ", we will study the infinite population limit in detail .",
    "we consider the dynamics of eigen s model @xcite that describes the population dynamics of self - replicating molecules which at low mutation rates and large times form a dynamic and heterogeneous quasispecies consisting of fittest genotype and its closely related mutants .",
    "the existence of such an error threshold is a generic result seen in both simple and complex fitness landscapes , and has been reviewed in @xcite ( for recent related works , see @xcite ) .",
    "the focus of this article is however the _ dynamics _ of the quasispecies model .",
    "we show that the population fraction at a genotype obtained within a simplified shell model @xcite ( also see @xcite ) of quasispecies dynamics is good only for highly fit sequences and at short times .",
    "however , the behavior of the most populated genotype is captured correctly by the shell model .",
    "we calculate exactly some properties of the jumps ( as defined above ) within the shell model which were obtained numerically in previous works @xcite .",
    "specifically , we show that the jump distribution decays as @xmath5 in time and @xmath6 as a function of the distance @xmath7 from the starting genotype for a class of fitness landscapes .",
    "the basic difference between a finite and infinite population is that while the former has a finite mutational spread in the genotypic space , all the mutants are available at all times in the quasispecies limit . due to this reason , at large times , a finite population gets trapped at a local fitness peak and the jump probability is governed by the rate of stochastic tunneling @xcite which allows the population to cross the fitness valley via few low fitness mutants . in the quasispecies model on the other hand , the reproduction or selection plays the more important role than the production of mutants and a jump occurs when the population at a fit genotype overtakes the less fitter one .",
    "although the underlying physical processes responsible for a jump are different for finite and infinite populations , we find that the jump distribution is robust in that it decays as @xmath5 in both the cases .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we define a class of mutation - selection models .",
    "section  [ quasi - shell ] discusses the dynamics of quasispecies model and shell model .",
    "we calculate exactly the statistics of jumps within the shell model in section  [ jump - shell ] .",
    "these results for infinite population limit are compared with those obtained in simulations of finite population in section  [ jump - finite ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary of our results .",
    "models    we consider a haploid , asexual population of size @xmath8 each of whose constituents carry a string @xmath9 of length @xmath10 where @xmath11 can assume @xmath12 values .",
    "the string @xmath13 can represent a genetic sequence ( @xmath14 ) , protein ( @xmath15 ) or a sequence of @xmath10 loci with @xmath16 alleles @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will deal with binary sequences for which @xmath17 and @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "the environment of the population is represented by a fitness landscape which is obtained by associating a non - negative real number @xmath20 to each sequence . in this article",
    ", we consider fitness @xmath20 to be a random variable chosen independently from a common distribution @xmath21 .",
    "this generates a maximally rugged fitness landscape with an exponentially large number ( in @xmath10 ) of local maxima @xcite and strong interactions amongst the loci @xcite .",
    "the population evolves on this fitness landscape in discrete time via selection and mutation , and we ignore other factors responsible for genetic mixing such as recombination .",
    "our model is thus applicable to microorganisms like _ e. coli _ and hepatitis c virus which have zero or very low recombination rate @xcite .",
    "consider a population well adapted to a given environment localised around a peak of the fitness landscape . a change in the environment brings about a change in the fitness landscape , and the population will typically find itself in a fitness valley .",
    "we consider the adaptation process of the population starting from such an initial condition .",
    "the population fraction @xmath22 of sequence @xmath13 at time @xmath4 is iterated using wright - fisher dynamics defined as follows . in each generation",
    ", an offspring selects a parent @xmath23 with probability @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fitness of the parent @xmath23 with sequence @xmath13 and @xmath26 is the average fitness of the population .",
    "then the probability @xmath27 that parent @xmath23 has @xmath28 offspring in one generation is given as p(n)= n n ( ) ^n ( 1- ) ^n - n  .",
    "this implies that the average number of offspring produced equals @xmath29 and hence the fitness @xmath20 has the physical meaning that it is proportional to the number of descendants produced per generation .",
    "further , as the relative variance in the offspring number decays as @xmath30 , it follows that the offspring number fluctuates from one generation to another for finite population but one can ignore these fluctuations arising due to random sampling for @xmath31 .",
    "after the reproduction process , point mutations are introduced independently at each locus of the sequence @xmath32 with probability @xmath33 per generation .",
    "thus , a sequence @xmath13 is obtained via mutations with the probability p_ = ^d(, ) ( 1 - ) ^l - d(, ) [ mut ] where the hamming distance @xmath34 is the number of point mutations in which the sequences @xmath13 and @xmath32 differ .",
    "since the selection process is not stochastic for infinite populations , the population frequency also does not fluctuate and one can work with the average frequency @xmath35 where the averaging is over all realizations of the sampling process .",
    "this leads to a deterministic nonlinear equation for the fraction @xmath36 @xcite , ( , t+1)=   [ quasi ] where the denominator is the normalization constant .",
    "quasi - shell    the focus of this section is the quasispecies model and the related shell model . in the following , we will mainly work with the unnormalised population @xmath37 defined as @xcite ( , t)=x(,t ) _",
    "= 0^t-1 _  w( ) x(,t ) in terms of which the nonlinear evolution ( [ quasi ] ) reduces to the following linear iteration ( , t+1)= _ ^ p_^ w( ) z(,t )  .",
    "linear since at the start of the adaptation process the population finds itself at a low fitness genotype , we start with the initial condition @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a randomly chosen sequence . for small mutation probability @xmath33 ( @xmath40 )",
    "as seen in various asexual microbes @xcite , after one iteration we have ( , 1)= ^d(,^(0 ) ) w(^(0 ) )  .",
    "one - gen thus each sequence gets populated in one generation with a fraction which is same for all the sequences in a _",
    "shell _ of constant hamming distance @xmath41 from the initial sequence @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of @xcite showed that dynamical properties involving the most populated genotype such as the distribution of evolution times and number of jumps are very well described by a simplified model which ignores mutations for further evolution and allows the population at each sequence to grow with its own fitness .",
    "thus within the shell model , the population @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "here we provide an analytical understanding of the quasispecies model leading to the shell model .",
    "we will find that the expression for @xmath37 in shell model is a good approximation for sequences with high fitness and at short times .",
    "for @xmath43 , consider ( [ linear ] ) for a sequence @xmath13 in the shell @xmath44 centred about @xmath39 and at a hamming distance @xmath41 from the center .",
    "the sum on the right hand side of ( [ linear ] ) has three kind of terms : ( i ) sequence @xmath13 does not mutate ( _ i.e. _ @xmath45 in the sum ) so that its contribution @xmath46 , ( ii ) a mutation occurs in @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the set of @xmath32 s lying inside shell @xmath44 that satisfy @xmath49 resulting in @xmath50 dependence and ( iii ) a mutation occurs either in the sequences in the inner shells that do not belong to set @xmath48 or , in the sequences in and outside shell @xmath44 giving a term of order @xmath51 and higher . in order to obtain @xmath37 to order @xmath50 , we can neglect the last contribution and iterate the population according to ( , t+1)= w()z(,t ) + _ ^ i ^d(, ) w( ) z(,t )  .",
    "the above equation is still coupled but one can make further simplifications by proceeding as follows .",

    "as argued in the last subsection , @xmath192 is given as the derivative ( with respect to @xmath7 ) of the average shell fitness . from the scaling form ( [ scal ] ) , we see that the average shell fitness is proportional to @xmath180 . for @xmath7 of order @xmath10 ,",

    "when some of these mutants further acquire a favorable mutation , then the whole population quickly jumps to the next local peak with higher fitness @xmath200 .",
    "the physical process involved when a jump occurs in a finite population is thus different from that in the quasispecies case . in the latter case ,",
    "each local peak is already populated albeit with a small frequency and a jump occurs when the population at a fitter sequence overtakes the current leader .",
    "we are interested in the jump distribution of large finite populations with @xmath196 close to one . at large times",
