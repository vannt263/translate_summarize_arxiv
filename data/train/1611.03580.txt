    "it is also well - known that the inequality admits no nontrivial extremizers , and this fact implies a possibility for to be improved by adding some remainder terms .",
    "in fact , the authors in @xcite proved that the following improved hardy inequality @xmath7 holds for all @xmath5 provided that @xmath0 is bounded , where the constant @xmath8 in is given by @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the lebesgue measures of the unit ball and @xmath0 on @xmath1 , respectively , and the absolute constant @xmath12 denotes the first zero of the bessel function @xmath13 .",
    "the constant @xmath8 is optimal if @xmath0 is a ball , but still the inequality admits no nontrivial extremizers .",
    "more generally , the authors in @xcite obtained the inequality @xmath14 for @xmath5 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a positive constant independent of @xmath17 .",
    "similar improvements have been done for the hardy inequality not only in the @xmath18-setting but in @xmath19-setting with some remainder terms , see for instance @xcite .",
    "hardy type inequalities are known as useful mathematical tools in various fields such as real analysis , functional analysis , probability and partial differential equations .",
    "in fact , hardy type inequalities and their improvements are applied in many contexts .",
    "for instance , hardy type inequalities were utilized in investigating the stability of solutions of semi - linear elliptic and parabolic equations in @xcite . as for the existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions of the heat equation involving singular potentials ,",
    "see @xcite . among others",
    "we refer to @xcite for the concrete applications of hardy type inequalities .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for a comprehensive understanding of hardy type inequalities .",
    "based on the historical remarks on the hardy type inequalities , our purpose in this paper is to establish the classical hardy inequalities in the frame work of equalities which immediately imply the hardy inequalities by dropping the remainder terms . at the same time , those equalities characterize the form of the vanishing remainder terms .",
    "our method on the basis of equalities presumably provides a simple and direct understanding of the hardy type inequalities as well as the nonexistence of nontrivial extremizers .    in what follows",
    ", we always assume @xmath20 and the standard @xmath21 norm is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "then the hardy type inequalities in @xmath18-setting that we discuss in this paper are the following : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the inequalities , , and are standard ( see @xcite for instance ) , while is rather new ( see @xcite ) . in addition , as we noticed in @xcite , the logarithmic hardy inequality has a scaling property .",
    "we state our main theorems .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the radial derivative defined by @xmath27 . the space @xmath28 denotes the completion of @xmath29 under the dirichlet norm @xmath30 .",
    "also the notation @xmath31 denotes the unit sphere in @xmath1 endowed with the lebesgue measure @xmath32 .",
    "our first theorem now reads :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath33 .",
    "then the equalities @xmath34 hold for all @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , the second term in the right hand side of or vanishes if and only if @xmath36 takes the form @xmath37 for some function @xmath38 , which makes the left hand side of infinite unless @xmath39 : @xmath40    we remark that as in , functions of the form imply the nonexistence of nontrivial extremizers for . the corresponding integral diverges at both origin and infinity .",
    "a similar result to theorem [ thm1 ] can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , the essential ideas for the proofs are different .",
    "indeed , the proof in @xcite is done by direct calculations with respect to the quotient with the optimizer of a hardy type inequality .",
    "on the other hand , we shall prove theorem [ thm1 ] by applying an orthogonality argument in general hilbert space settings .",
    "more precisely , an equality @xmath41 has been observed in @xcite .",
    "we should remark that and are the same for radially symmetric functions and are not the same for nonradial functions .",
    "in fact , the dirichlet integral is decomposed into radial and spherical components as @xmath42    next , we state the logarithmic hardy type equalities in the critical weighted sobolev spaces .    [ thm2 ] let @xmath43 .",
    "then the equalities @xmath44 hold for all @xmath45 and all @xmath46 with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is defined by @xmath24 .",

    "the proofs of all theorems in this paper is essentially based on orthogonality in general hilbert space settings .",
