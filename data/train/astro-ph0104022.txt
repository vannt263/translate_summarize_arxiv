    "a variety of recent observational measurements @xcite have sharply constrained the space available to the standard model cosmological parameters .",
    "specifically , phenomenological data fitting using the standard einstein - friedmann cosmological evolution equation @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is due to ordinary @xmath7 matter and where @xmath8 is due to a cosmological constant @xmath9 ) is found to favor current era values @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with the current era deceleration parameter @xmath12 then having to be of order @xmath13 . while these values are very supportive of the flat @xmath14 inflationary universe paradigm @xcite , they are nonetheless extremely troubling . specifically , solving eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath15 and @xmath16 yields @xmath17 where @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 the identification @xmath20 of the cosmological constant with a typical particle physics temperature scale @xmath21 of order @xmath22 degrees ( viz .",
    "@xmath23 sec@xmath24 ) would then yield ( for @xmath25 km / sec / mpc ) a value for @xmath26 of order @xmath27 , a value not only overwhelmingly larger than its obtained fitted value , but one not at all compatible with the bounded @xmath28 required by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) . or , alternatively , if an @xmath29 of order one is taken as a given , an associated @xmath26 of order @xmath30 could then only be reconciled with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) in the event that @xmath31 was of order @xmath32 and thus nowhere near flat .    to get round this problem",
    "the standard paradigm then proposes that instead of using such a particle physics based @xmath33 one should instead , and despite the absence of any currently known justification , fine - tune @xmath33 down by about 60 orders of magnitude and replace it by the phenomenological @xmath34 sec@xmath24 with the values @xmath35 , @xmath36 then ensuing .",
    "however , in its turn , such a proposal then engenders a further fine - tuning problem for the standard model since for such a value of @xmath33 the early universe associated with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) would need to be one in which @xmath37 would have had to be have been incredibly close to one at the planck time @xmath38 , while @xmath39 would have had to have been as small as @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , given such initial conditions , the universe would then be such that it would decelerate ( @xmath41 ) continually in all epochs until the cosmological constant finally manages to catch up with the red - shifting matter density , something which for the phenomenologically chosen value for @xmath33 would occur at the incredibly late @xmath42 when @xmath43 would at long last finally change sign . while it is very peculiar that such a turn around is to occur just in our particular epoch ,",
    "nonetheless , independent of one s views regarding the merits or otherwise of such a proposal , the proposal itself is actually readily amenable to testing , with a modest increase in the range of @xmath2 ( say to @xmath1 ) in the @xmath44 hubble plot being able to reveal the presence of any possible such turn around .",
    "moreover , such a study would be completely independent of any dynamical assumptions ( such as those required for the ( complementary ) extraction of cosmological parameters from the structure of the cosmic microwave background ) and would thus be completely clear cut .",
    "thus in and of itself it would be extremely informative to extend the range of the hubble plot .",
    "however , as we now show , it would be of additional interest since it would allow for a rather unequivocal comparison between standard cosmology and the recently proposed alternate conformal cosmology , a theory where cosmic acceleration is not at all of recent vintage .",
    "given the fine - tuning needs of the standard cosmology , it is of value to explore candidate alternate cosmologies both in and of themselves and also as a ( potentially instructive ) foil to the standard theory itself . of such possible alternate theories conformal gravity ( viz .",
    "gravity based on the fully covariant , locally conformal invariant weyl action @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the conformal weyl tensor and where @xmath47 is a purely dimensionless gravitational coupling constant ) is immediately suggested since it possesses an explicit symmetry ( conformal invariance ) which when unbroken would require the cosmological constant to vanish .",
    "the cosmology associated with the conformal gravity theory was first presented in @xcite where it was shown to possess no flatness problem , to thus release conformal cosmology from the need for the copious amounts of cosmological dark matter required of the standard theory .",
    "subsequently @xcite , the cosmology was shown to also possess no horizon problem , no universe age problem , and , through negative spatial curvature , to naturally lead to cosmic repulsion.@xmath48 finally , it was shown @xcite that even after the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken by a @xmath49 inducing cosmological phase transition , the cosmology is still able to control the contribution of the induced cosmological constant to cosmic evolution even in the event that @xmath49 is in fact as big as particle physics suggests , to thereby provide a completely natural solution to the cosmological constant problem . in the present paper",
    "we show that this control actually enables us to provide for a complete and explicit accounting of the recent high @xmath2 supernovae hubble plot data without the need for any fine tuning at all .    to explicitly analyze conformal cosmology it is convenient to consider the generic conformal matter action @xmath50",
    "\\label{5}\\ ] ] for massless fermions and a conformally coupled order parameter scalar field .",
    "for such an action , when the scalar field acquires a non - zero expectation value @xmath51 , the entire energy - momentum tensor of the theory is found ( for a perfect matter fluid @xmath52 of fermions ) to take the form @xcite @xmath53 with the complete solution to the scalar , fermionic and gravitational field equations of motion in a background robertson - walker geometry ( viz .",
    "a geometry in which @xmath54 ) then reducing to just one relevant equation , viz .",
    "@xmath55 , a remarkably simple condition which immediately fixes the zero of energy .",
    "we thus see that the evolution equation of conformal cosmology looks identical to that of standard gravity save only that the quantity @xmath56 has replaced the familiar @xmath57 , so that instead of being attractive the effective cosmological @xmath58 is actually negative to thus naturally lead to cosmic repulsion , and instead of being fixed as the standard low energy @xmath59 , the cosmological @xmath60 is instead fixed by the altogether different scale @xmath51 to thus enable it to be altogether smaller than @xmath59.@xmath61 as we shall see below , it is precisely the replacing of the cosmological @xmath59 by an altogether smaller @xmath60 that enables conformal gravity to naturally solve the cosmological constant problem .    given the equation of motion @xmath62 , the ensuing conformal cosmology evolution equation is then found ( on setting @xmath63 ) to take a form quite similar to eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , viz .",
    "@xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "further , unlike the situation in the standard theory where preferred values for the relevant evolution parameters ( such as the magnitude and even the sign of @xmath49 ) are only determined by the data fitting itself , in conformal gravity essentially everything is already a priori known . with conformal gravity not needing dark matter to account for non - relativistic issues such as galactic rotation curve systematics @xcite , @xmath67 can be determined directly from luminous matter alone , with galaxy luminosity counts giving a value for it of order @xmath68 or so .",
    "further , with @xmath9 being generated by particle physics vacuum breaking in an otherwise scaleless theory , since such breaking lowers the energy density , @xmath9 must unambiguously be negative , with it thus being typically given by @xmath69 where @xmath21 is a necessarily particle physics sized scale .",
    "then with @xmath60 also being negative , the quantity @xmath70 must thus be positive , just as needed to give cosmic acceleration ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "similarly , the sign of the spatial 3-curvature @xmath72 is known from theory @xcite to be negative , something which has been independently confirmed from a phenomenological study of galactic rotation curves @xcite . moreover , since @xmath60 is negative , the cosmology is singularity free and thus expands from a ( negative curvature supported ) finite maximum temperature @xmath73 , a temperature which is necessarily greater @xcite ( and potentially even much greater @xcite ) than @xmath21 . and",
    "finally , with @xmath60 being negative , the quantity @xmath74 must be negative for ordinary @xmath75 matter , with @xmath43 thus being negative in all epochs.@xmath76 consequently in the conformal theory we never need to fine tune in order to make any particular epoch such as our own be an accelerating one , and as we shall show below , the conformal theory not only gives some current era acceleration but in fact gives just the amount needed to account for the currently available hubble plot data .",
    "given only that @xmath49 , @xmath72 and @xmath60 are in fact all negative in the conformal theory , the evolution of the theory is then completely determined , with the expansion rate being found @xcite to be given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 . in terms of the parameters",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath21 we thus obtain @xmath80 at any @xmath81 without any approximation at all . from eq . ( [ 9 ] ) we thus immediately see that simply because @xmath73 is overwhelmingly larger than the current temperature @xmath82 , i.e. simply because the universe is as old as it is , it automatically follows , without any fine - tuning at all , that the current era @xmath83 has to lie somewhere between zero and one today no matter how big ( or small ) @xmath21 might actually be , with conformal gravity thus having total control over the contribution of the cosmological constant to cosmic evolution .",
    "conformal gravity thus solves the cosmological constant problem by quenching @xmath83 rather than by quenching @xmath49 itself ( essentially by having a @xmath60 which is altogether smaller than the standard @xmath59 ) , and with it being the quantity @xmath83 which is the one which is actually measured in cosmology , it is only its quenching which is actually needed . with conformal gravity thus being able to naturally accommodate a large @xmath49 we are now actually free to allow @xmath21 to be as large as particle physics suggests .",
    "then , for such a large @xmath84 we see that the quantity @xmath85 has to be completely negligible today@xmath86 so that @xmath87 must thus , without any fine - tuning at all , necessarily lie between zero and minus one today notwithstanding that @xmath21 is huge . moreover , noting that @xmath88 we immediately see that the current era @xmath83 is given by the completely bounded @xmath89 ( so that the current era curvature contribution to cosmic expansion is then given as @xmath90 ) , with the current deceleration parameter being given by the nicely bounded @xmath91 .",
    "the essence of the conformal gravity approach then is not to change the matter and energy content of the universe but rather only their effect on cosmic evolution , with the cosmological constant itself no longer needing to be quenched .    while completely foreign to standard gravity , a universe in which @xmath92 makes a completely negligible contribution to current era cosmic evolution is , as we now show , nonetheless fully compatible with the currently available @xmath0 hubble plot data",
    "specifically , through use of type ia supernovae the authors of @xcite were able to measure the dependence of luminosity distance @xmath93 on redshift out to @xmath4 . to fit their data we thus need to determine the dependence of @xmath93 on @xmath2 in the conformal theory , something we can readily do now that we have obtained the expansion factor @xmath94",
    "thus , in the conformal theory we find first that the hubble parameter is given as @xmath95 with its current ( @xmath96 ) value being found to obey @xmath97 , with the current age of the universe then being given by @xmath98/(-q_0)^{1/2}h_0 $ ] , viz .",
    "by @xmath99 . for temperatures well below @xmath73 and for the naturally achievable @xcite",
    "@xmath100 case of most practical interest to conformal gravity ( viz .",
    "a case where @xmath101 can be of order one ) we may set @xmath102 , so that for geodesics @xmath103^{1/2}$ ] we obtain @xmath104 then , with @xmath105 where @xmath106 , we find that we can express the general luminosity distance @xmath107 entirely in terms of the current era @xmath108 and @xmath87 according to the very compact relation @xmath109^{1/2}\\right\\}/q_0 \\label{13}\\ ] ] conformal gravity fits to the luminosity distance can thus be parametrized via the one parameter @xmath87 , a parameter which must lie somewhere between zero and minus one , with @xmath93 thus having to lie somewhere between @xmath110 and @xmath111 at temperatures well below @xmath73 . given eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) we turn now to a data analysis .",
    "for the fitting we shall follow @xcite and fit 38 of their 42 data points together with 16 of the 18 earlier lower @xmath2 points of @xcite , for a total of 54 data points with reported effective blue apparent magnitude @xmath112 and uncertainty @xmath113 .",
    "( while we thus leave out 6 questionable data points for the fitting , nonetheless , for completeness we still include them in the figures . ) for the fitting we calculate the apparent magnitude @xmath114 of each supernova at redshift @xmath2 via @xmath115 ( @xmath93 in mpc ) where @xmath116 is their assumed common absolute magnitude , and minimize @xmath117 as a function of the two parameters @xmath87 and @xmath116 . in all of our fits @xmath116 ( as determined using @xmath118 km / sec / mpc ) is found to be in agreement with the analyses of @xcite , with our best fit @xmath119 being obtained for @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "we display this fit as the upper curve in fig .",
    "( 1 ) where we also present as the lower curve the corresponding @xmath35 , @xmath36 standard model fit , a fit which gives @xmath122 ( and @xmath121 ) for the same 54 points . as we thus see , in the detected region the best fits of the two models are completely indistinguishable , only in fact departing from each other at the highest available redshifts .",
    "moreover , the conformal cosmology fits turn out to be extremely insensitive to the actual value of @xmath87 , with other typical @xmath123 fits being @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128.@xmath129 the data will thus support conformal cosmologies with a fairly broad range of negative values of @xmath87 beginning at @xmath130 .",
    "in fact such high quality @xmath130 fits ( viz . fits with @xmath131 )",
    "have already been reported earlier,@xmath132 with the authors of @xcite having noted in passing that such fits were actually as good as their best standard model fits , and with the authors of @xcite having presented such @xmath130 fits in an exploration of generic power law expansion rate cosmologies .",
    "what is new here is that we derive such @xmath130 fits within the framework of a well - defined cosmological model while also extending them to non - zero @xmath87 ( i.e. to non - zero @xmath49 ) .",
    "as we just noted , current hubble plot data do not allow us to resolve between standard and alternate gravity theories .",
    "however , since the standard theory is a decelerating one above @xmath4 while the conformal theory continues to accelerate , continuation of the hubble plot beyond @xmath4 will actually enable us to discriminate between the various options .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we plot the higher @xmath2 expectations .",
    "the highest curve in the figure is the conformal gravity fit for @xmath120 , the middle curve in the figure is the conformal gravity fit for @xmath130 , and the lowest curve in the figure is the @xmath35 , @xmath36 standard model expectation . as we see , the curves start to depart from each other fairly rapidly once we go above @xmath4 , with the three cases respectively yielding @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 at @xmath1 , a difference of at least @xmath136 magnitudes between standard gravity and the conformal alternative .",
    "( at @xmath137 the respective magnitudes are @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 . )",
    "since conformal gravity handles the cosmological constant problem , the primary problem troubling the standard theory , so readily ( its other successes and its own difficulties are discussed in @xcite ) it would thus appear to merit further consideration , with only a modest extension of the hubble plot readily enabling us to discriminate between standard gravity and its conformal alternative while potentially even being definitive for both.@xmath141 the author is indebted to drs . g. v. dunne , k. horne , d. lohiya , r. plaga and b. e. schaefer for helpful comments .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the department of energy under grant no .",
    "de - fg02 - 92er40716.00 .",
    "since this paper was first released it was announced @xcite that new analysis of sn 1997ff now puts this supernova at @xmath142 and establishes a lower bound on its luminosity large enough to definitively exclude the two most commonly considered non - cosmological explanations ( dust extinction and intrinsic luminosity evolution ) of the supernovae hubble plot data .",
    "interestingly , this lower bound turns out to be very close not only to the values ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) expected of @xmath130 and @xmath120 conformal gravity at @xmath3 but also to the nearby @xmath145 expectation of an @xmath146 , @xmath36 standard model at that @xmath2 , thus making further exploration of the @xmath147 region potentially very significant . in their analysis",
    "the authors of @xcite present their sn 1997ff data in the form of confidence contours in distance modulus ( @xmath148 ) versus redshift space . to illustrate their data we have augmented fig .",
    "( 2 ) by adding in the 68% and 95% confidence region values for the apparent magnitude @xmath114 ( as obtained from the quoted @xmath148 by adding @xmath121 ) at redshifts @xmath149 , @xmath3 and @xmath150 , and have presented an enlarged view of the relevant region in fig .",
    "( in these figures the two inner horizontal bars on the vertical data points represent the extent of the 68% confidence region at each of the chosen redshifts while the two outer bars represent the 95% confidence one . ) to estimate the effect of sn 1997ff on the @xmath151 that we obtained for our fits to the @xmath0 data we have calculated the change in @xmath152 generated by an effective additional data point with the 68% confidence region value of @xmath153 at redshift @xmath142 , to find typical values @xmath154 and @xmath155 to be compared with @xmath156 for the standard model .    while the conformal gravity @xmath157 values are actually less than those generated by some of the outlier points in the @xmath0 data,@xmath158 it is important to note that as well as possessing statistical errors the sn 1997ff data happen to also possess an explicitly identified systematic error .",
    "specifically sn 1997ff just happens to be lensed by two foreground galaxies at @xmath159 both of which lie very close to the line of sight , with the authors of @xcite estimating that this would cause sn 1997ff to appear 0.2 magnitudes or so brighter than it actually is . dimming the quoted distance modulus data by this amount would serve to move conformal gravity into the 68% confidence region with the modified @xmath160 then becoming @xmath161 and @xmath162 to be compared with a modified @xmath163 for the standard model .",
    "thus we see that at present it is not yet possible to discriminate between standard gravity and the conformal alternative , with both of the theories being compatible with the sn 1997ff data .",
    "in fact , given that there is a systematic lensing effect ( and as yet only one @xmath147 data point of course ) , we see that since the dimmed data straddle the coasting ( @xmath164 at all times ) universe ( equivalent to @xmath130 conformal gravity ) , at the present time one is not in fact able to determine whether the universe is actually accelerating or decelerating above @xmath4,@xmath165 with further data ( such as those anticipated in the upcoming snap satellite mission ) thus being needed to resolve the issue and identify any specific trend in the @xmath147 region that might exist .",
    "in fact , well in advance of the recent high @xmath2 data , it had been noted @xcite that in a @xmath166 ( and consequently @xmath167 ) conformal cosmology the current era @xmath87 would be zero . @xmath166 conformal gravity thus possesses a repulsion not present in a @xmath166 standard cosmology .",
    "the non - relativistic terrestrial and solar system conformal gravity expectations are completely standard @xcite , being controlled by a local @xmath59 whose dynamical generation is totally decoupled @xcite from that of the cosmological @xmath60 , with it being only in the continuation beyond the solar system that the standard and conformal gravity theories actually depart from each other .",
    "@xmath85 is suppressed by @xmath60 being small , and not by @xmath67 itself being small , with @xmath60 being made smaller the larger rather than the smaller @xmath51 gets to be , to thus enable the @xmath170 ratio to be as large as particle physics suggests while not leading to any 60 order of magnitude conflict with observation .      since redshift position uncertainties @xmath171 are also reported in the supernovae data , for completeness we have also minimized @xmath172 where @xmath173 ^ 2/2+[5log_{10 } d_l(q_0,z_i-\\delta z_i)-5log_{10 } d_l(q_0,z_i)]^2/2 $ ] is the effect of the redshift uncertainty , with it being the fitting procedure itself which is used to normalize @xmath174 to the apparent magnitude . with this prescription",
    "we then find that our best conformal gravity fit is now given as @xmath175 for the 54 points , to be compared with the corresponding best  @xmath35 , @xmath36 standard model fit of @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , the conformal cosmology fits continue to be insensitive to the actual value of @xmath87 , with other typical @xmath123 fits then being @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "while such @xmath182 fits would have to be associated with an @xmath183 , @xmath184 empty universe in the standard model , in the conformal theory they would instead be associated with a current era @xmath185 , @xmath186 universe , viz .",
    "one with its normal fill of matter but which is now in a curvature dominated phase .          even in the standard model",
    "fits to the data below @xmath4 some 10 of the 54 fitted points are each individually found to contribute an amount in excess of 2 units to the total @xmath176 ( the largest single individual contribution goes as high as @xmath187 ) , with all of these particular points thus lying quite a bit away from the expected standard model value . with there thus being a lot of scatter in the hubble plot data one can only extract limited information from any given single data point"
