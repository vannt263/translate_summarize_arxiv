    "metastable states and configurational entropy , are central concepts in our understanding of low temperature relaxation of disordered and glassy systems @xcite . in presence of time scale separation between `` fast '' and `` slow '' degrees of freedom relaxation",
    "is often described as a walk between metastable states , intended as regions of configuration space where the fast degrees of freedom reach a state of quasi equilibrium before the relaxation of slow degrees of freedom can effectively take place . according to the adam and gibbs theory @xcite the configurational entropy , i.e. the logarithm of the multiplicity of metastable states is related to the relaxation time by an inverse proportionality relation .",
    "the relation between metastability and relaxation is well understood in infinite range spin glasses with `` random first order transition '' @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of these systems is exactly described by the equations of ideal mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    "the mode coupling transition , spurious in liquid systems , is here driven by the existence of metastable states capable to trap the system for time scales diverging with the systems size .",
    "the divergence is of course a mean field artifact , but features of mean - field metastable states could well have a reflex in finite dimensional glassy systems @xcite .",
    "a well known problem in the study of metastable states is that while they are easy to define within mean field theory , their definition becomes elusive in finite dimensions .",
    "this problem has been studied in large detail in the context of systems with first order phase transition , where the problem of metastability , can be considered as satisfactorily understood @xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "this is not the case in glassy systems , where despite the appeal of a description of dynamics in terms of metastable states , only very rare contributions have tried to clarify the meaning of metastability beyond the phenomenological level @xcite .",
    "the `` random first order transition scenario '' has led to phenomenological attempts to treat the problem of glassy relaxation , and ergodicity recovery in analogy with kinetics of ordinary first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "liquids at low temperature would appear as `` mosaic states '' , in which locally frozen variables configurations could be composed combinatorially on a large scale .",
    "the typical size of the rigid regions could be computed in a nucleation theory , with the configurational entropy playing the role of an ergodicity restoration bulk driving force , competing with some postulated interface tension .",
    "these developments stimulated first principle calculations in microscopic disordered models . in ref .",
    "@xcite and later in @xcite a statistical description of the ergodic state and a computation of the glassy coherent length below @xmath0 was proposed through the asymptotic analysis of a landau - like glassy effective free - energy derived from microscopic models .",
    "unfortunately , in that papers it was not possible to make an explicit connection between the computed free - energy barrier and the relaxation time of the system .",
    "scope of this letter is to discuss this connection . in order to do that ,",
    "we start from an analysis of glassy relaxation based on separation of time scales .",
    "we argue that finite dimensional relaxation is dominated by metastable states that can be characterized along the classical lines of lebowitz and penrose ( lp ) @xcite , first proposed to describe metastable phases of matter in presence of first order phase transitions . according to lp ,",
    "metastable states can be considered as constrained equilibrium ensembles with : 1 ) an order parameter is homogeneous on a suitable mesoscopic length scale 2 ) a large time life and 3 ) a very small probability of return once abandoned . in analogy with the work of lp ,",
    "we use in our analysis models with long - but - finite range kac kind of interactions , which in our case have a disordered character .",
    "these offer the possibility of studying finite dimensional effects in an expansion around mean field , and the local mean - field character of correlations , postulated in the phenomenological mosaic description , appears as a consequence of the range of interaction @xcite .",
    "let us consider a spherical kac p - spin glass model@xcite defined for real spins @xmath1 on the @xmath2-dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath3 of linear size @xmath4 and hamiltonian @xmath5 where the couplings @xmath6 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian variables with zero average and variance @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an integer @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is a non - negative integrable function verifying the normalization @xmath11 . with this choice ,",
    "the couplings @xmath6 are sensibly different from zero only if all pairs of variables @xmath12 @xmath13 , so that only variables that are at distances @xmath14\\ ; { < \\atop\\sim}\\ ; \\gamma^{-1}$ ] effectively interact .",
    "the effective interaction range @xmath15 will be assumed to be large throughout the paper .",
    "we partition the lattice in boxes @xmath16 of a coarse graining length size @xmath17 and impose a local spherical constraint @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "we are interested to the regime where the three defining lengths are supposed , as in lp , to verify the relation @xmath20 and for definiteness we will have in mind the situation where @xmath21 for some @xmath22 .",
    "the model is chosen in such a way to reduce to the usual mean - field spherical @xmath8-spin model in the regime @xmath23 .",
    "let us recall the physics of this case @xcite that will be useful in the finite @xmath24 case . on lowering the temperature from the paramagnetic region one encounters two transitions .",
    "there is a first transition at the mode coupling temperature @xmath0 where ergodicity is broken .",
    "below @xmath0 an exponential number of ergodic components @xmath25 dominates the thermodynamics .",
    "the configurational entropy @xmath26 decreases as a function of the temperature , until it becomes zero at a `` kauzmann temperature '' @xmath27 , where a second transition is met .",
    "this structure of states can be studied through the so - called `` quenched glassy potential '' that considers the free - energy @xmath28 of a system @xmath29 constrained to have a fixed global overlap @xmath30 with a typical reference equilibrium configuration @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this function has the shape depicted in figure [ pot ] , in the region @xmath32 one finds a two minimum structure analogous to the free - energy as a function of the order parameter for mean - field systems with a first - order phase transition .",
    "the value of the overlap in the low minimum and high minima represent respectively the typical overlap among random configurations in different and the same ergodic components .",
    "both minima are associated to the exponential multiplicity of ergodic components , and their difference gives directly the configurational entropy times the temperature @xmath33 .",
    "we now address the question of restoration of ergodicity for finite @xmath24 and @xmath32 . the relaxation of model ( [ hp ] )",
    "can be conveniently studied through langevin dynamics @xmath34 where @xmath35 are lagrange multipliers that enforce in average the local spherical constraint at each time and the @xmath36 are white noise variables with correlations @xmath37 .",
    "an insight on the dynamics in the regime ( [ regime ] ) can be obtained studying the kac limit @xmath38 after the thermodynamic limit . through standard dynamical techniques",
    "-martin - siggia - rose formalism @xcite or dynamical cavity method @xcite- , it is possible to conclude @xcite that the finite time local equilibrium spin - spin correlation function @xmath39 on the scale @xmath17 , tends to a space homogeneous function , @xmath40 , that for temperatures larger then the kauzmann temperature @xmath41 verifies the usual equilibrium mean field equation for the spherical p - spin model @xcite @xmath42 this equation predicts ergodicity breaking below @xmath0 .",
    "the equilibrium correlation function in this regime approaches exponentially fast on a scale @xmath43 a non zero limit @xmath44 .",
    "conversely , for any finite @xmath45 , for finite or infinite @xmath4 , the system should be able to escape from the metastable states and @xmath46 coincide with the equilibrium correlation function @xmath47 . in the regime ( [ regime ] ) , the behavior of @xmath48 can be schematically depicted as in figure [ fig1 ] . as a function of time ,",
    "the small @xmath24 correlation function remains close to the mean field curve up to some characteristic time @xmath49 diverging when @xmath50 and it decays to zero on longer scales .",
    "since for small enough @xmath24 this characteristic time is arbitrary larger than the mean field relaxation time @xmath43 , one finds that the system equilibrates in the region of phase space where the local overlaps with the initial condition are close to @xmath51 before relaxing further .",
    "moreover , one can expect that on time scales of the order of @xmath43 , the system has homogeneous correlations on the scale of the box size @xmath17 , with typical fluctuation from cell to cell of @xmath52 scaling as @xmath53 . in turn , assuming independence of the fluctuations beyond some finite length , using extreme statistics one can estimate the maximum deviation @xmath54 $ ] to be at most of order @xmath55 .",
    "this , according to our hypothesis , can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "the previously discussed properties are enough to characterize the regions explored on scales smaller then @xmath49 as metastable states in the lebowitz - penrose sense .",
    "the role of the `` order parameter '' , homogeneous in space , is played by the overlap of the configuration of the system with the initial condition @xmath56 .",
    "formally , for any typical equilibrium configuration @xmath31 , we can define metastable states , as equilibrium ensembles where the configurations @xmath29 are such that in each box @xmath16 the overlap with the initial configuration @xmath57 is suitably close to @xmath51 .",
    "more precisely , one defines an interval @xmath58 $ ] , with @xmath59 and the set @xmath60 .",
    "the metastable state is the restricted ensemble @xmath61 as in the lp case , the definition of metastable state makes sense for a whole range of values of @xmath62 , such that a local fluctuation of the overlap larger then @xmath62 is with high probability pushed back to @xmath51 .",
    "however , in order for the definition to be useful , the value of @xmath62 should be fixed a posteriori in such a way that a fluctuation larger then that size should be amplified , and eventually run the system out of the metastable state with finite probability .",
    "we can now use this analysis to estimate the relaxation rate of our system as a decay rate of the metastable state .",
    "we can then proceeds as in lp , and argue that for the local langevin dynamics we are using , the relaxation rate @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the set of configuration @xmath29 belonging to @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 for at least one point @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is in principle a random variable that depends on the initial configuration @xmath31 and on the quenched random couplings @xmath70 .",
    "however the relaxation rate should be self - averaging with respect to both sources of noise , and its typical value can be computed considering the average of its log @xmath71 where @xmath72 stands for the canonical average over @xmath31 and the quenched average over the distribution of the disorder @xmath73 .",
    "( [ quattro ] ) is the main result of this paper .",
    "it connects the relaxation rate to a free - energy barrier computable in principle in purely static terms .",
    "for fixed disorder and given finite volume we can define an `` effective potential '' as the free - energy cost to keep the overlap with an equilibrium configuration @xmath31 in each of the boxes @xmath16 fixed to specified values @xmath74 : @xmath75)= \\sum_\\sigma \\prod_x \\delta(q_x(\\sigma,\\sigma^*)-q_x ) e^{-\\beta h(\\sigma , j)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the expression , we have anticipated the scaling of the free - energy with the interaction range @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "is is clear how @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be related to @xmath78 $ ] , in fact , for @xmath79 , with transparent notation @xmath80}.   \\label{sei}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the previous discussion , the dominant profile in @xmath77 is estimated as the constant @xmath81 for all @xmath19 . for this profile ,",
    "the extensive part of @xmath82 $ ] is a self - averaging quantity : @xmath83\\approx { e}(w_{\\sigma^*,j}[q_x = q_{ea}])$ ] .    for generic overlap profiles",
    "@xmath74 , we can consider @xmath84= { e}(w_{\\sigma^*,j}[q_x])$ ] , and ask if the knowledge of this quantity is enough to reconstruct the relaxation rate @xmath85 for small @xmath24 .    the restricted partition function @xmath86 is : @xmath87}.\\ ] ] each term of the sum on @xmath68 will be dominated by a single profile , minimizing @xmath78 $ ] in presence of the constraints . these will be profiles with a localized excitation around @xmath68 , corresponding to a finite free - energy cost with respect to the uniform state @xmath81 .",
    "for fixed @xmath31 and @xmath73 , different values of @xmath68 could give rise to different free - energy cost and different profile shapes .",
    "however , we could argue again that on the mesoscopic scale @xmath15 almost all sites @xmath68 would give the contributions of the same order and these dominate the relaxation rate .",
    "this is a stronger hypothesis than the other ones underlying our reasoning .",
    "it implies that the incipient spatial heterogeneities on a scale @xmath15 responsible for relaxation , have equal probability of appearing in any point of space , independently of the reference configuration @xmath31 and the realization of the quenched disorder @xmath73 . without that , the computation of @xmath88 should start from an evaluation of ( [ quattro ] ) .",
    "this is in principle possible and when done could allow the validation or refutation of the hypothesis .",
    "previous work @xcite was implicitly based on that strong hypotheses .",
    "within that framework , if we denote by @xmath89 the profile maximizing @xmath90 $ ] for @xmath91 , the relaxation rate will be given by @xmath92-v[q_x = q_{ea}]\\right)}\\ ] ] and @xmath93 $ ] will provide a landau free - energy functional that we can use in a nucleation - like theory .",
    "it is clear that restricted to profiles constant in space , @xmath94 , for small @xmath24 we have : @xmath95\\approx(l\\gamma)^d \\phi(q)$ ] , where @xmath96 is the mean - field potential . in order to compute the free - energy barrier within this self - averaging setting",
    ", one should consider spherically symmetric solutions with boundary conditions @xmath97 .",
    "formulated in this way the problem reduces to the computation of a critical droplet as suggested by phenomenological theories @xcite . according to conventional nucleation theory @xcite , close to @xmath41 where the two minima are close to degeneracy",
    ", one can use the `` thin wall approximation '' and evaluate the interface tension through the 1d instantonic solutions connecting the two minima .",
    "this competes with a bulk driving term given by the free - energy difference between the minima , which in our case is the mean - field configurational entropy .",
    "this first principle formulation confirms the prediction of phenomenological theories , that the configurational entropy provides the bulk driving force to ergodicity restoration .",
    "the actual computation of @xmath98 for fixed profile can be performed through a modified version of the replica method @xcite , needed to average over the spin reference configuration @xmath31 and the quenched disorder @xmath73 .",
    "this has been done for the model ( [ hp],[wij ] ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . without entering in the details of the discussion of that paper we just mention that within a specific replica ansatz it is possible to find a finite _ surface _ tension is found for @xmath99 approaching @xmath41 .",
    "this implies a glassy coherent length behaving as @xmath100 and an adam - gibbs free energy barrier @xmath101 .",
    "this result is supported by a more elaborated ansatz in @xcite . as discussed in @xcite , and in view of possible non self - averaging effects , these solution could in fact just provide approximations to the true barrier .",
    "the `` right '' replica solutions could change the exponent @xmath102 appearing in the relation . however , the general adam - gibbs structure of the formula , that only depends on the fact that the bulk ergodicity restoring force is the configurational entropy , should remain unchanged .",
    "summarizing , we have presented an argument that identifies as lebowitz - penrose metastable states the dominant configurations of relaxing glassy systems below the mode coupling transition .",
    "this allows to compute the relaxation time in purely static term through the evaluation of the probability of equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "the relation between relaxation time and free - energy barrier is summarized in eq .",
    "( [ quattro ] ) which is the main result of this letter .",
    "we have also discussed how previous results in the literature relate implicitly to a self - averaging hypothesis .",
    "if this holds , the relevant fluctuations have the shape of overlap droplets , and the bulk driving force for ergodicity restoration is provided by the configurational entropy . in agreement with phenomenological theories the relation of the relaxation time with the configurational",
    "entropy follows a generalized adam - gibbs equation .",
    "the argument has been presented in the case of disordered spin model , where playing with the interaction range one can have time scales as much separated as wanted and a mesoscopic scale for which correlations are homogeneous on short time scales . on the other hand",
    "our argument is actually only based on the hypothesis that time separation is such to allow partial equilibration of the fast degrees of freedom for fixed values of the slow one , and as such it should be generically valid when this condition is respected .",
