    "the problem of understanding cold nuclear matter from qcd first principles has remained quite challenging due to the intrinsic non - perturbative nature of the problem @xcite . while many non - perturbative problems such as the finite temperature problem can be studied using lattice qcd techniques , the problem of finite density qcd is marred by the presence of the fermion sign problem @xcite ; only low densities can be studied and that too only at large temperatures @xcite as all available methods are only valid for small values of @xmath1 . as such it is useful to find certain limiting cases for the study of cold nuclear matter , in which the problem of finite density qcd becomes somewhat more tractable .",
    "large @xmath0 qcd is a limit where the physics simplifies considerably @xcite .",
    "only planar diagrams contribute at leading order in @xmath0 while quark loops effects are suppressed . despite these simplifications , the problem of large @xmath0 qcd has remained unsolved .",
    "however , the problem in 1 + 1 dimension is more tractable @xcite ; here the physics simplifies considerably because gluons , due to the absence of magnetic fields in one spatial dimension , do not propagate .",
    "additionally , with appropriate choice of gauge ( either axial or coulomb ) , gluon - gluon interactions are absent and hence the theory looks very much like qed , in which color charges ( i.e. quarks ) interact via a coulomb potential .",
    "the self - energy corrections to the quark propagator come from an infinite number of ladder diagrams , which remarkably can be summed up exactly in spite of the need to solve a bootstrap equation .",
    "furthermore , the meson spectrum can be solved  albeit only numerically via a bethe - salpeter equation ; a linear  regge trajectory \" ( with no continuum ) is observed .    unlike the meson problem in 1 + 1 large @xmath0 qcd ,",
    "the baryon problem is highly non - trivial .",

    "indeed , the differences are large enough that one might worry the differences suggest a possible problem with the formulation of ref .  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to verify numerically that this is the case by going to exceptionally large box sizes .",
    "given this situation , it is quite useful to have a regime in which one can independently compute the mass of a baryon to verify that the winding effects are as large as they appear to be for practical - sized boxes .",

    "the principal attraction of this regime is that it appears to be tractable due to witten s mean - field arguments and the non - relativistic nature of heavy quark dynamics .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of baryonic matter ( as opposed to a single baryon ) a plausible but _ ad hoc _ assumption was needed : that at low densities the ground state is composed of individual baryons each in a color - singlet state with the wave function of quarks for each baryon orthogonal to the wave function of quarks in any other baryon .",
    "this structure appears quite plausible , but it is _ ad hoc _ in that one can construct mean - field configurations in which the entire state is color - singlet but can not be broken into individual color singlet baryons . in 3 + 1 dimensions",

    "the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the results .",

    "@xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "thus the leading order contribution to the energy comes from a coherent one - gluon exchange between pairs of @xmath0 quarks .",

    "similarly , spin effects are suppressed for heavy quarks .",

    "<S> this paper studies baryons and baryonic matter in the combined large @xmath0 and heavy quark mass limits of qcd in 1 + 1 dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this regime allows for a simple physical picture , which is computationally tractable . in this non - relativistic limit </S>",
    "<S> , baryons are composed of @xmath0 quarks that interact , at leading order in @xmath0 , through a color coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> using variational techniques , single baryon masses and interaction energies of low - density baryon crystal are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the single baryon calculations are very accurate and can be used as a cross - check to the general numerical approach based on hamiltonian methods for baryons and baryonic matter in 1 + 1 dimension for arbitrary quark mass recently proposed by bringoltz , which is based on a lattice in a finite box . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the bringoltz method differs from a previous approach developed by salcedo , _ et al . _ in its treatment of an effect due to the finite box size with periodic boundary conditions  namely , the existence of gauge configurations which wind around the box . </S>",
    "<S> as these are finite volume effects , one might expect them to be small for boxes that are large enough so that the baryon density approaches zero to high accuracy at the edges of the box . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effects of these windings appear to be quite large even in such boxes . </S>",
    "<S> the large mass infinite volume calculations performed here are consistent with the results of numerical calculations using the bringoltz approach and confirm the importance of gauge fields that wrap around for finite systems . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the baryon crystal interaction energy requires the assumption that at low - densities the ground state is composed of individual baryons , each in color - singlet states , with wave functions orthogonal to one another . </S>",
    "<S> while plausible , this assumption is somewhat _ ad hoc _ in that one can construct configurations in which the entire state is color - singlet but can not be broken into individual color - singlet baryons . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interaction energy of low - density baryon crystals calculated with this assumption is consistent with numerical results based on bringoltz s approach . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the assumptions regarding the color structure is justified in 1 + 1 dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this is useful , as it supports a similar assumption that was made in 3 + 1 dimensions , where there is no alternative means of calculation . </S>"
