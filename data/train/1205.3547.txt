    "direct reciprocity is among main reasons for cooperation between pairs of individuals that repeatedly meet each other @xcite .",
    "however , individuals , in particular humans , cooperate with others even when they seldom meet the same partners more than once , as is the case for large populations .",
    "reputation - based indirect reciprocity ( also called downstream reciprocity ; we simply call it indirect reciprocity in this paper ) seems to be a dominant mechanism that enables cooperation in this situation . in indirect reciprocity , individuals cooperate with others with good reputations and they in turn gain good reputations if they appositely behave ( e.g. , cooperate ) toward somebody else . the conditions under which indirect reciprocity realizes cooperation have been theoretically and numerically clarified in great details @xcite .    under the so - called image scoring , cooperation and defection",
    "are regarded to be good and bad behavior , respectively @xcite .",
    "laboratory experiments suggest that humans use image scoring to evaluate others behavior @xcite .",
    "however , main theories attain that image scoring does not stabilize cooperation @xcite .",
    "although some studies have shown the viability of cooperation under image scoring @xcite , the situations in which cooperation occurs are , in our view , quite restricted ( but see @xcite ; we discuss this reference in discussion ) . under image scoring",
    ", cooperation occurs only when individuals always cooperate in the first round @xcite , unconditional defectors sometimes cooperate @xcite , the number of interaction obeys the binomial distribution @xcite or poisson distribution @xcite , the probability that individuals recognize others reputations increases in time @xcite , or the reputations of individuals are revealed to others with a small probability @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reason for the discrepancy between the experiments and theory remains obscure .    for mathematical tractability and possible influences of the first seminal theoretical papers on this subject @xcite ,",
    "most theoretical results of indirect reciprocity are derived from the analysis of binary reputation models . in other words ,",
    "individuals are endowed with the binary reputation , i.e. , good ( @xmath0 ) or bad ( @xmath1 ) , depending on the last action toward others and other factors .",
    "however , the binary reputation may not be realistic in that only the last behavior of an individual in the social dilemma situation determines the reputation of the individual .",
    "in fact , experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite studies of indirect reciprocity in the context of online marketplaces often assume that the reputations are many valued , which complies with the reality of online marketplaces @xcite . more than binary valued reputations have also been employed in numerical studies of indirect reciprocity in theoretical biology literature @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , these studies are not concerned with relationships between the degree of cooperation and the number of the possible reputation values .    in this paper",
    "we analyze a trinary reputation model to identify stable populations that realize cooperation .",
    "the difference between the present results and those derived from the binary reputation models is remarkable . in particular",
    ", we find that image scoring can stabilize cooperation in the trinary reputation model .",
    "we consider an infinitely large population . in each generation",
    ", the so - called donation game is repeated for sufficiently many rounds .",
    "figure  [ fig : model](a ) illustrates the interaction in each round .",
    "two players are randomly selected from the population , one as donor and the other as recipient , with the equal probability .",
    "the donor intends to cooperate ( c ) or defect ( d ) toward the recipient according to the action rule @xmath2 , which we define below .",
    "we assume that the donor misimplements intended c such that the donor actually defects with probability @xmath3 and that the intended d is always correctly implemented .",
    "we seek the possibility of cooperation in the population under this kind of implementation error , which is adverse to cooperation @xcite .",
    "if the donor implements c , the donor pays cost @xmath4 , and the recipient obtains benefit @xmath5 . if the donor implements d , the payoffs to the donor and recipient do not change .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 such that the donation game is essentially the prisoner s dilemma .",
    "we assume that each player possesses a reputation that takes one of the three values , i.e. , @xmath7 ( good ) , @xmath8 ( neutral ) , or @xmath9 ( bad ) .",
    "the action rule @xmath2 is a function from the recipient s reputation to the donor s intended action ( i.e. , c or d ) .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath10 action rules , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) .",
    "for example , the allc and alld intend c and d regardless of the recipient s reputation , respectively .",
    "the so - called generous discriminator ( gdisc ) intends c when the recipient s reputation is either @xmath7 or @xmath8 and d otherwise .",
    "the so - called rigorous discriminator ( rdisc ) intends c when the recipient s reputation is @xmath7 and d otherwise .    at the end of each round ,",
    "the observer assesses the donor to be @xmath0 or @xmath1 depending on the donor s implemented action ( i.e. , c or d ) and the recipient s reputation ( i.e. , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 ) . such an assessment rule is a function from the donor s implemented action and the recipient s reputation to the observer s assessment and is called the second - order social norm , which extends the concept in the case of the binary reputation @xcite .",
    "there are @xmath11 social norms .",
    "for example , under the social norm called image scoring ( fig .  [",
    "fig : model](c ) ) , the observer assigns @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the donor s actions c and d , respectively , regardless of the recipient s reputation .",
    "another social norm named scoring ",
    "standing is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](c ) .",
    "finally , we assume that the assessment ( i.e. , @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) that the donor receives is opposite to the one assigned by the observer with probability @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we assume that the donor s reputation is publicly shared in the population .",
    "in other words , the donor s new reputation is instantaneously known to all the players in the population .",
    "we repeat many rounds of the game and define the payoff to each player as the sum of the payoff obtained in the games that involve the player .",
    "because the population is infinite , each pair of players plays the game at most once such that direct reciprocity is excluded .    for a later use ,",

    "we analyzed a trinary reputation model of indirect reciprocity and identified cooperative nash equilibria composed of a single action rule or mixture of two action rules .",
    "independent of details of the reputation dynamics ( i.e. , gradual or saltatory ) , we found at a small error level ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) that @xmath132 homogeneous populations and five mixed populations are cooperative and stable under different social norms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamicsa](a ) ) .",
    "when the error probabilities are even smaller , eight homogeneous populations and four mixed populations remain stable ( appendix b ) . in particular , under image scoring , the heterogeneous population composed of gdisc and cdc ( a variant of rdisc ) is stable in the error - free limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scoring](a ) ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : model](b ) for the definition of gdisc , cdc , and rdisc ) .",
    "the results derived from the trinary reputation model and those derived from the binary reputation model @xcite are similar in some aspects .",
    "for example , the standing  standing social norm ( i.e. , @xmath139 , @xmath187 ) in the trinary model coincides with the standing social norm in the binary model ( fig .  [",
    "fig : model](d ) ) if we merge the @xmath8 and @xmath9 reputations in the trinary model .",
    "therefore , the result that standing ",
    "standing enables cooperation is not surprising .",
    "similarly , scoring  judging ( i.e. , @xmath155 , @xmath147 ) , for example , is almost equivalent to judging in the binary model if we merge @xmath7 and @xmath8 reputations in the trinary model .",
    "however , the results for the trinary and binary models are fundamentally different in the following two aspects .",
    "first , shunning ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model](d ) in the case of the binary reputation model ) is more supportive of cooperation in the trinary than binary model . in the binary model ,",
    "shunning results in a cooperation probability of @xmath188 in the error - free limit unless a cooperation prone initial condition and a finite number of rounds are combined @xcite or reputations of players are only partially visible to others @xcite . in the trinary model , shunning  standing and shunning  judging stabilize full cooperation in the error - free limit ( appendix b ) . under these social norms , a donor meeting a recipient with an @xmath8 reputation receives @xmath1 irrespective of the action , which is common to the behavior of the binary model . in the trinary model , however ,",
    "even if a donor obtains a @xmath9 reputation , the donor easily receives @xmath0 either by cooperating with a @xmath7 recipient or justifiably defecting against a @xmath9 recipient . owing to the contribution of the justified defection , a donor gains @xmath0 more often than @xmath1 on average .",
    "if players with the @xmath7 reputation increase in number owing to this mechanism , players more likely receive @xmath0 than @xmath1 .",
    "this positive feedback sustains cooperation under shunning  related social norms in the trinary model .",
    "second , and the more important , image scoring is capable of supporting cooperation in our model .",
    "even if we consider self mutants , which avoid a b reputation and are as selfish as possible , image scoring supports cooperation if the probability that a g reputation transits to a b reputation in one step is positive . in previous literature , the self strategy is recognized as a strong competitor that spoils cooperation in the indirect reciprocity game with more than two possible reputation values @xcite .",
    "our conclusion that image scoring can support cooperation is consistent with the results derived from behavioral experiments @xcite and those derived from numerical simulations @xcite but opposite to those derived from the binary reputation model @xcite .",
    "we reached this conclusion by simply introducing a third reputation to the standard binary model of indirect reciprocity .",
    "the cooperation under image scoring in our model does not require forced cooperation in the first round @xcite , partial cooperation of defective players @xcite , binomially or poisson distributed number of rounds @xcite , growth of social networks used for transmission of reputation @xcite , or a small probability with which the donor s reputation is revealed to other players @xcite",
    ".    in our model , cooperation under image scoring occurs for the following intuitive reason .",
    "although the composition of the stable population depends on the benefit - to - cost ratio and the error probabilities , the main action rule present in the stable population is gdisc , which cooperates with @xmath7 and @xmath8 recipients and defects against @xmath9 recipients . in the equilibrium ,",
    "most gdisc resident players possess the @xmath7 reputation .",
    "if some alld mutants are present , a @xmath9 player in the population is likely to be alld and not gdisc . with the trinary reputation ,",
    "gdisc players justifiably defect ( i.e. , d against a @xmath9 recipient ) but do not selfishly defect ( i.e. , d against a @xmath7 or @xmath8 recipient ) .",
    "a donor that has justifiably defected would receive an @xmath8 reputation but not a @xmath9 reputation because few recipients have the @xmath9 reputation in the population .",
    "therefore , gdisc players would not obtain the @xmath9 reputation .",
    "gdisc players that happen to obtain the @xmath8 reputation , when selected as donor , likely meet a recipient with a @xmath7 reputation such that they regain the @xmath7 reputation .",
    "in contrast , alld players would obtain the @xmath9 reputation such that they are not helped by others .",
    "this contrasts with the case of the binary reputation model , in which a discriminating donor that defects against whatever recipient immediately receives the worst reputation ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) and then is defected by others .    the presence of downward saltation ( i.e. , transition from the g reputation to b reputation in one step ) is a key to make a cooperative population stable against invasion by self mutants . to explain this point intuitively ,",
    "let us consider a homogeneous population of gdisc and assume that the implementation and assessment errors are absent .",
    "if downward saltation is absent in the reputation dynamics , self mutants flip between g and n reputations by alternatingly cooperating and defecting . by doing so",
    ", the self mutants can elicit cooperation from gdisc residents and cooperate with probability @xmath188 .",
    "because gdisc residents cooperate with probability @xmath189 , the gdisc population is invaded by self mutants . however , if downward saltation can occur in the reputation dynamics , a nonnegligible fraction of self mutants possess the b reputation because they defect when they have the g reputation .",
    "in contrast , gdisc players maintain the g reputation because they cooperate even if they have the g reputation .",
    "therefore , in the presence of downward saltation , self mutants can not invade the population of gdisc residents .",
    "the mechanism of cooperation under image scoring in our model is similar to that under the so - called tolerant scoring proposed by berger @xcite .",
    "the population of tolerant discriminator , which defects against a recipient if the recipient has defected in the last two rounds and cooperates otherwise , is stable .",
    "berger s results and ours are different in the following aspects .",
    "first , berger assumed three action rules , i.e. , tolerant discriminator , which is similar to gdisc , allc , and alld and investigated the behavior of the model under tolerant scoring .",
    "we carried out an exhaustive search of the space of the action rule and social norms to find the viability of image scoring .",
    "second , in our model , cooperation is stable even if the reputation moves only one step in a round , if the self mutants are not considered .",
    "it should be noted that berger did not consider the self mutants .",
    "third , cooperation is realized by a homogeneous population of one type of players in the berger s model . in our model ,",
    "cooperation is realized by mixture of two types of discriminative players ( i.e. , gdisc and cdc ) .",
    "the present study has following limitations .",
    "first , we assumed that all the players in the population use the same social norm .",
    "this oversimplification excludes a possible situation in which different norms compete in a population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , we only analyzed the stability of populations composed of up to two action rules for simplicity .",
    "third , we analyzed local stability of the equilibria and disregarded dynamics .",
    "even when a cooperative equilibrium is locally stable , it may in fact attract a tiny fraction of initial conditions .",
    "fourth , we assumed that the reputation sharing is public .",
    "in other words , the information about the donor s new reputation immediately spreads from the observer to the entire population . in a large population ,",
    "such immediate spreading is impossible , and one has to assume , for example , that only a fraction of players gains the information about a donor in one game @xcite .",
    "under the saltatory reputation dynamics ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dynamics](b ) ) , we obtain @xmath190 equation   and the normalization @xmath37 lead to @xmath191 = \\frac{1}{z}\\left [   \\begin{array}{c }    ( 1-\\beta_{\\rm u}){\\phi^*}^2+\\beta_{\\rm u } \\phi^ * \\vspace{-2mm}\\cr    ( 1-\\beta_{\\rm d } \\beta_{\\rm u})\\phi^*(1-\\phi^ * ) \\vspace{-2mm}\\cr    ( 1-\\beta_{\\rm d})(1-\\phi^*)^2+\\beta_{\\rm d}(1-\\phi^ * )   \\end{array }   \\right ] ,   \\label{eq : ap_c2}\\ ] ] where @xmath192 .",
    "we defined cooperative equilibrium as stable population in which the probability of cooperation is larger than @xmath133 for some @xmath115 such that @xmath172 . to justify this criterion",
    ", we carry out additional numerical simulations with various error probabilities satisfying @xmath169 .",
    "the probability of cooperation in each stable homogeneous population is shown for various error probability values in fig .",
    "[ fig : robustness ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : robustness ] shows that , under @xmath193 out of the @xmath131 stable action  norm pairs , the probability of cooperation seems to converge to unity in the error - free limit .",
    "it should be noted that we identified @xmath132 , not @xmath193 , cooperative homogeneous populations in the main text .",
    "one of the @xmath193 action  norm pairs is excluded because it is stable only for large @xmath115 values ( i.e. , @xmath194 ) at @xmath195 ( table  [ table : tab1 ] ) .",
    "the probability of cooperation is larger than @xmath133 for some @xmath115 for five out of the nine stable heterogeneous populations composed of two action rules .",
    "for all the five heterogeneous populations , the probability of cooperation is larger than @xmath133 for a @xmath115 value smaller than @xmath134 at @xmath123 .    in the homogeneous populations , under eight out of the @xmath193 social norms for which the probability of cooperation seems to converge to unity in the error - free limit , i.e. , standing  standing , standing  judging , standing  shunning , judging  standing , judging  judging , judging  shunning , shunning  standing , and shunning  judging , the range of @xmath115 in which the corresponding action rule is stable tends to @xmath196 as the error probabilities become small .",
    "for example , under standing  standing , standing  judging , judging  standing , and judging  judging , the homogeneous population of rdisc is stable in the range @xmath197 when @xmath198 ; the corresponding range is @xmath145 when @xmath123 ( table  [ table : tab1 ] ) . under the other five social norms , i.e. , standing  scoring , scoring  standing , scoring  judging , scoring  shunning , and scoring ",
