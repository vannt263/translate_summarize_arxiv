    "recently , nanomechanical resonators ( namrs )  @xcite have demonstrated great potential for applications in quantum measurement @xcite and high - precision displacement detection @xcite , and have attracted considerable attention . with improved techniques , high quality factors ( from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) and large fundamental frequencies ( in the range of mhz - ghz )  @xcite  have been achieved .",
    "this puts the namr in the quantum limit in which the vibrational energy is smaller than the thermal energy , i.e. , @xmath4 . as a consequence ,",
    "namrs can serve as components in more sophisticated quantum systems @xcite operating under a large frequency range from the microwave to the optical domain . among these systems ,",
    "a namr embedded in a superconducting qubit is a good candidate for exploring various quantum phenomena at the boundary between classical and quantum regimes .",
    "for example , controllable coupling @xcite , quantum entanglement @xcite , squeezed state @xcite , quantum detection @xcite , ground - state cooling @xcite and phonon blockade @xcite have been studied . however , the usefulness of qubit - namr systems in further investigations is limited by their simple structures and the few degrees of freedom .",
    "more complex hybrid systems should thus be considered .",
    "one possibility is to engineer a qubit - namr system into a coplanar - wideguide ( cpw ) resonator .",
    "such a system can serve as the analog of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) providing a basic interaction between light and matter .",
    "it can also be used to study interesting phenomena such as quantum - classical transition @xcite .",
    "also , a tunable strong coupling between a microwave cavity and a namr mediated by a cooper pair transistor has been studied recently @xcite . moreover , strong coupling  @xcite or even ultrastrong coupling  @xcite between a cpw resonator and a superconducting qubit has been achieved .",
    "this can be important for quantum information processing .",
    "nevertheless , due to the size mismatch between typical namrs and cpw resonators , their direct coupling is in general weak and uncontrollable as well .    motivated by these issues",
    ", we generalize the setups in refs .",
    "@xcite and propose a tripartite system to realize a strong and controllable effective coupling between a namr and a cpw resonator via a flux qubit .",
    "the qubit has a large detuning from both the namr and the cpw resonator .",
    "after eliminating the degrees of freedom of the qubit using a unitary transformation and a second - order approximation , we are able to find the effective coupling between the two resonators .",
    "we further show that this effective coupling can be switched on or off and tuned from weak to very strong via controlling an external magnetic field parallel to the plane of the qubit .",
    "we also investigate the voltage - fluctuation spectrum ( vfs ) of the cpw resonator in the hybrid system .",
    "we show that the vfs depends on the qubit state .",
    "the resonant peak in the spectrum splits into two in the presence of the namr and the qubit .",
    "the separation between the pair of peaks increases when the coupling strength between the qubit and the namr is enhanced by increasing the magnetic field .",
    "we further give an analysis on the reflectance of an incident photon by the cpw resonator .",
    "we show that the incident photon can have a perfect reflection in the whole frequency range in the absence of the namr . however , in the presence of the namr , the reflectance dips at resonance .",
    "furthermore , the peak splitting occurring in the vfs is associate with an analogous split of the dip in the reflectance .",
    "in particular , the reflectance can be tuned from 1 to 0 by varying the coupling strength between the qubit and the namr .",
    "therefore , the namr can work as a quantum router to direct the incident photon from one channel to the other .",
    "we also discuss briefly the phase shift of a single photon traveling in the cpw resonator .",
    "specifically , the phase - shift spectrum shows a narrow spectral feature of non - zero shift close to the resonant point . in the presence of the namr ,",
    "this spectral feature also splits into a doublet .",

    "therefore , the coupling strength @xmath41 can be directly controlled by the external magnetic field @xmath5 .    to minimize the effect of the flux noise , we bias the flux qubit at its degeneracy point ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) . also , we use the eigenstates of the flux qubit as the new basis states . then , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . neglecting the fast oscillating terms via the rotating - wave approximation",

    "this frequency shift can be understood as a result of the dispersive interaction between the flux qubit and the cpw resonator , which induces a qubit - state - dependent frequency shift in the cpw resonator or a photon - number - dependent frequency shift in the flux - qubit transition frequency .",
    "as we concentrate on the cpw resonator and trace out the degrees of freedom of the flux qubit initially in the ground state , we can observe the red - shift of the frequency for the cpw resonator .",

    "the underlying physics is that the peaks of the cpw resonator and the namr are first shifted by the flux qubit due to the dispersive interaction , and then the states of the cpw resonator are dressed by the namr because of the induced effective coupling @xmath72 .",
    "that is why two peaks can be observed in fig .",
    "note that the reduced namr - cpw resonator system governed by the hamiltonian  ( [ reduced h ] ) is not in resonance when @xmath76 , since the modified frequencies of the namr and the cpw resonator are associated with the coupling strengths @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in our proposed hybrid system , while the coupling @xmath47 between the cpw resonator and the flux qubit is fixed , the coupling @xmath48 is however tunable via the externally applied magnetic field @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we also show the vfs of the cpw resonator for two different values of the coupling strength @xmath48 .",
    "these results reveal that as @xmath48 increases , the height of the left peak increases but that of the right peak decreases .",
