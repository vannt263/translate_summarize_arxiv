    "symmetries of quantum mechanical systems are described by a group of transformations that preserves its essential structures .",
    "they play a fundamental role in studying the properties of the quantum system and reveal fundamental aspects of the theory which are not present neither in the dynamics involved nor in the forces . space or time symmetries , internal symmetries , the study of invariant states or spontaneously broken symmetries are standard ingredients in the description of quantum theories . in many cases quantum numbers or superselection rules are labels characterizing representations of symmetry groups . the publication of the seminal books of weyl , wigner and van der waerden ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in the late twenties also indicates that quantum mechanics was using group theoretical methods almost from its birth .",
    "we refer , e.g. , to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  12 ) or @xcite for a more thorough introduction to various symmetry notions in quantum mechanics .",
    "it was shown by wigner that any symmetry transformation of a quantum system preserving the transition probabilities between two states must be implemented by a semi - unitary ( i.e. , by a unitary or an anti - unitary ) operator ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* introduction ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 2 ) ) .",
    "the action of a symmetry group @xmath0 on a system is given in terms of a semi - unitary projective representation of @xmath0 on the physical hilbert space , that can be described in terms of semi - unitary representations of @xmath6-central extensions of the group or by means of an appropriate representation group ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "since the main examples of symmetries considered in this article will be implemented in terms of unitary operators we will restrict here to this case .",
    "moreover , anti - unitary representation appear rarely in applications ( typically implementing time reversal ) and restrict to discrete groups .",
    "the situation with an anti - unitary representation of a discrete symmetry group can also be easily incorporated in our approach .    in order to motivate how the symmetry can be implemented at the level of unbounded operators ,",
    "consider a self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath7 on the hilbert space @xmath8 and let @xmath9 be the strongly continuous one - parameter group implementing the unitary evolution of the quantum system .",
    "then , if @xmath0 is a quantum symmetry represented by the unitary representation @xmath10 it is natural to require that @xmath5 and @xmath2 commute , i.e. , @xmath11 at the level of self - adjoint generators and , recalling that the domain of @xmath7 is given by @xmath12 we have that ( [ commute ] ) implies @xmath13 of course , the requirement that the unitary representation @xmath5 of the symmetry group @xmath0 commutes with the dynamics of the system as in eq .",
    "( [ commute ] ) is restrictive .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is a strongly continuous representation of a lie group , then ( [ commute ] ) implies the existence of conserved quantities that do not depend explicitly on time .",
    "nevertheless , the previous comments justify that in the context of a single unbounded symmetric operator @xmath7 ( not necessarily a hamiltonian ) it is reasonable to define @xmath0-invariance of @xmath7 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : first - inv ] ) ( see section  [ sec : vonneumannsymmetry ] for details ) .    in the study of quantum systems",
    "it is standard that some heuristic arguments suggest an expression for an observable which is only symmetric on an initial dense domain but not self - adjoint .",
    "the description of such systems is not complete until a self - adjoint extension of the operator has been determined , e.g. , a self - adjoint hamiltonian operator @xmath7 . only in this case",
    "a unitary evolution of the system is given .",
    "this is due to the one - to - one correspondence between densely defined self - adjoint operators and strongly continuous one - parameter groups of unitary operators @xmath14 provided by stone s theorem .",
    "the specification of a self - adjoint extension is typically done by choosing suitable boundary conditions and this corresponds to a global understanding of the system ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "accordingly , the specification of the self - adjoint extension is not just a mathematical technicality , but a crucial step in the description of the observables and the dynamics of the quantum system ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  x ) for further results and motivation ) .",
    "we refer also to @xcite for recent textbooks that address systematically the problem of self - adjoint extension from different points of view ( see also the references therein )",
    ".    the question of how does the process of selecting self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators intertwine with the notion of quantum symmetry arises .",
    "this question is at the focus of our interest in this article .",
    "we provide here natural characterizations of those self - adjoint extensions that are compatible with the given symmetries . concretely , if a symmetric operator is @xmath0-invariant in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq : first - inv ] ) , then it is clear that not all self - adjoint extensions of the operator will also be @xmath0-invariant .",
    "this is evident if one fixes the self - adjoint extension by selecting boundary conditions . in general , these conditions need not preserve the underlying symmetry of the system .",
    "we present in section  [ sec : vonneumannsymmetry ] and section  [ sec : invariantqf ] the characterization of @xmath0-invariant self - adjoint extensions from two different point of views : first , in the most general context of deficiency spaces provided by von neumann s theorem .",
    "second , using the representation theorem of quadratic forms in terms of self - adjoint operators .",
    "we prove in theorem  [ qainvariant ] a @xmath0-invariant version of the representation theorem for quadratic forms . in section",
    "[ sec : reduction ] we give an alternative notion of @xmath0-invariance in terms of the theory of von neumann algebras ( cf . , proposition  [ pro : affiliate ] ) .",
    "we relate also here the irreducible sub - representations of @xmath5 with the reduction of the corresponding @xmath0-invariant self - adjoint extension @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , we show that if @xmath7 is unbounded and @xmath0-invariant , then the group @xmath0 must act on the hilbert space via a highly reducible representation @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we apply the theory developed to a large class of self - adjoint extensions of the laplace - beltrami operator on a smooth , compact manifold with smooth boundary on which a group is represented with a traceable unitary representation ( see definition  [ def : traceable ] ) . in particular ,",
    "self - adjoint extension of the laplace - beltrami operator with respect to groups acting by isometries on the manifold are discussed . in this context",
    "the extensions are labeled by suitable unitaries on the boundary of the manifold ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "concrete manifolds like a cylinder or a half - sphere with @xmath15 or @xmath16 actions , respectively , will also be analyzed .",
    "apart from the previous considerations there are many instances where , though only partially , the previous problem has been considered .",
    "just to mention a few here we refer to the analysis of translational symmetries and the study of self - adjoint extensions of the laplacian in the description of a scalar quantum field in 1 + 1 dimensions in a cavity @xcite . in a different vein",
    "we quote the spectral analysis of hamiltonians in concentric spherical shells where the spherical symmetry is used in a critical way @xcite . in an operator theoretic",

    "for this we use systematically the notion of an unbounded operator affiliated to a von neumann algebra . in section",
    "[ sec : invariantlb ] we analyze the quadratic forms associated to the laplace - beltrami operator when there is a lie group acting on the manifold .",

    "it is thus natural to ask if given a symmetric operator one can find a closed extension of it that is self - adjoint and whether or not it is unique .",
