    "large sets of algebraic equations like ( 1.2 ) are not always easy to solve , especially when the domain of the solution is constrained , as it is here because of the triangle inequalities and their higher dimensional analogs . however , when the triangulation has a symmetry , solutions consistent with that symmetry are more easily obtained . a number of solutions of this type on triangulations of the manifolds @xmath14 and @xmath0 were exhibited in @xcite ( paper ii ) .",
