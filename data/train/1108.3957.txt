    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are the ionised nebulae ejected by low - intermediate mass stars that have undergone extensive mass loss during the agb phase . the central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) constitute a rich resource to study the late stages of binary stellar evolution .",
    "at least 40 close binary cspn are known that have orbital periods less than @xmath21 day ( miszalski et al .",
    "2011a ) and these make up at least @xmath3% of all cspn ( miszalski et al .",
    "2009a ) . with their short - lived nebulae ( @xmath210@xmath4 yrs ) close binary cspn are assured to have just recently passed through the common - envelope ( ce ) phase ( iben & livio 1993 ) . with significantly less time to undergo further angular momentum loss compared to other more evolved post - ce binaries ( schreiber & gnsicke 2003 ) , the orbital periods of close binary cspn reflect the true post - ce distribution .",
    "this makes them an excellent but relatively unexplored population to constrain ce population synthesis models .",
    "miszalski et al .",
    "( 2009a ) showed that there is a drop - off in the post - ce period distribution for periods @xmath5 1 day consistent with more evolved post - ce binaries ( rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "2008 ) . while the cause behind this sharp drop - off is not yet understood ( davis et al .",
    "2010 ) , even less is known about intermediate period binaries in pne ( @xmath21001500 days ) that are predicted by some models ( yungelson et al .",
    "1993 ; han et al .",
    "1995 ; de marco et al . 2009 ) and their anticipated connection with the period distribution of post - agb binaries that precede pne ( van winckel 2003a ) . at present",
    "there is essentially no hard evidence to support the existence of these binaries in pne , primarily because there have been no substantial long - term radial velocity monitoring campaigns .",
    "this is starting to change with some bright central stars included in the survey described by van winckel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "the best way to find intermediate period binaries is to look for giant or sub - giant companions whose orbits must be sufficiently large to accommodate their larger radii . as such cool companions are typically more luminous than their white dwarf ( wd ) companions , these binaries can usually only be found with the aid of uv photometry ( e.g. maxted et al .",
    "the arduous uv selection is already done for pne where the nebula acts as a natural signpost for the presence of a hot wd .",
    "all that is left is to identify a suitable cspn candidate too cool to ionise the pn and prove it has a physical connection to the nebula .",
    "a small number of cspn have suspected cool central stars ( e.g. lutz 1977 ; tab .",
    "4 of de marco 2009 ) , but very few have been studied in sufficient detail to rule out a line - of - sight superposition ( excluding k  1 - 6 , see frew et al .",
    "poor uv sensitivity is a likely explanation for suggestions that some are single cspn caught momentarily during a born - again phase ( bond & pollacco 2002 ) .",
    "perhaps the most studied of the cool central stars are those of the so - called a  35 type ( bond , ciardullo & meakes 1993 ) .",
    "the initial list included a  35 , lotr  1 and lotr  5 which have rapidly rotating sub - giants or giants accompanied by very hot white dwarfs peaking at uv wavelengths ( @xmath6 kk ) .",
    "the most interesting aspect of these binaries is that the secondaries of a  35 and lotr  5 both exhibit enhanced barium abundances ( thvenin & jasniewicz 1997 ) , while this has yet to be demonstrated for lotr  1 . since these initial discoveries bond , pollacco & webbink ( 2003 ) added webo  1 to the list and frew ( 2008 ) raised suspicions that the nebula of a  35 may not be a bona - fide pn .",
    "further additions of hd  330036 and as  201 may be drawn from barium enhanced yellow or d-type symbiotic stars which show extended nebulae ( schmid & nussbaumer 1993 ; pereira et al . 2005 ) , however the classification of such objects as pne is controversial ( corradi 2003 ; jorissen et al . 2005 ) . all these binaries may be classified as barium stars , peculiar red giants characterised by an overabundance of carbon and s - process heavy elements such as barium and strontium ( bidelman & keenan 1951 ) .",
    "they make up @xmath21% of all g  k giants , all of them are binaries with apparently wd companions ( mcclure et al .",
    "1980 ) and have orbital periods ranging from 87 up to @xmath22000 days ( jorissen & boffin 1992 ; mcclure & woodsworth 1990 ) . a smaller sample of barium dwarfs are known and are thought to evolved into barium giants , although they are less studied on the whole ( e.g. north , jorissen & mayor 2000 ; gray et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "boffin & jorissen ( 1988 ) devised what is now believed to be the canonical model for the formation of these stars . in this scenario the wind of its companion pollutes the future barium - enhanced star , most likely while it is on the main - sequence . this wind transfers carbon and s - process elements dredged up during thermal pulses on the agb .",
    "the agb star then evolved into a wd , which may have produced a pn , while the contaminated star evolved to become a red giant with chemical anomalies : a barium star .",
    "this accounts for the few known pne caught exactly during this phase , but there remains much work to identify and characterise further examples .",
    "none of the three firm examples , a  35 , lotr  5 and webo  1 , have determined orbital periods , while photometric monitoring has revealed the cool components to be rapid rotators with rotation periods of a few days .",
    "the rapid rotation could possibly have been caused by mass accretion ( jeffries & stevens 1996 ; theuns et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this work we present uv and optical observations of the _ _ diamond ring _",
    "_ pn a  70 ( pn g038.1@xmath025.4 , abell 1966 ) that prove the existence of a barium star binary cspn . the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al . 2006 ) recorded an unusually red @xmath7 mag colour for the cspn which suggested a sub - giant or giant classification .",
    "this prompted our investigation of the object even though it may have been possible to reach this conclusion from the original photographic magnitudes on blue ( 18.6 mag ) and red ( 17.4 mag ) plates .",
    "more recent studies of the abell sample lacked colour information for the cspn of a 70 and mostly repeated earlier measurements ( kaler 1983 ; kaler & jacoby 1989 ; kaler , shaw & kwitter 1990 ) .",
    "narrow - band imaging of the nebula was acquired by jewitt , danielson & kupferman ( 1986 ) , schwarz , corradi & melnick ( 1992 ) and most notably hua , dopita & martinis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we obtained spectroscopic observations of a  70 with gemini south under program gs-2009a - q-35 and the vlt under programs 083.d-0654(a ) and 085.d-0629(a ) .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] summarises the 0.7-wide longslit observations made using the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos , hook et al .",
    "2004 ) and the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 , appenzeller et al .",
    "1998 ) that had the blue - optimised e2v detector installed .",
    "basic data reduction was performed using the gemini iraf package and the eso fors pipeline after which the iraf task apall was used to trace and extract one - dimensional spectra . in all cases the surrounding nebula emission was subtracted close to the central star .",
    "flux calibration was also applied using spectrophotometric standard stars observed during the respective programs in the usual fashion .",
    "the s / n reached in the continuum near @xmath8   was measured using the splot task in iraf to range between 19 ( fors2 2009 ) and 30 ( gmos b ) .",
    "some narrow - band images were also observed by gmos ( see sect . [",
    "sec : imaging ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^,^,>,^ \" , ]     further distances imply a higher @xmath9 , higher @xmath10 , higher stellar luminosities and older @xmath11 , while shorter distances imply a lower @xmath9 , lower @xmath10 , lower stellar luminosities and a younger @xmath11 .",
    "if the ssv08 distance were adopted the stellar luminosities would imply an implausibly massive ionising star for the small associated @xmath11 and @xmath10 would be unusually low for a type i pn ( @xmath10 can reach 0.51 @xmath12 , see frew , parker & russeil 2006 ) .",
    "for these reasons we favour the 5.0 kpc sbr distance , although the accompanying @xmath9 is difficult to reconcile with the only moderately sub - solar oxygen abundance of 8.4 dex ( @xmath13 dex c.f .",
    "solar ) . a shorter distance would alleviate but not solve this problem , although a thick disk progenitor may be one solution to the problem .",
    "the type - i abundance of a  70 also places it against the general trend of decreasing n / o with increasing @xmath9 ( kppen & cuisinier 1997 ) and the empirical finding that most bipolar type - i pne are found at very low @xmath9 ( corradi & schwarz 1995 ) . whether the binary nature of a  70 could explain this incongruity remains to be proven .",
    "irrespective of the adopted distance , we can say that the white dwarf has turned onto the wd cooling track ( e.g. frew et al .",
    "2006 ) and that the luminosity of the companion is less certain .",
    "it could be either g8v ( for shorter distances ) or g8iv ( for larger distances , see sandage et al .",
    "improved central star magnitudes and spectroscopy are required to decide between each luminosity class , so for now we adopt g8iv - v .",
    "the g8iv - v star with ba  ii and sr  ii enhancement , chromospheric h@xmath1 emission and negligible to low radial velocity amplitude , coupled with the _ galex _ uv detection of the wd , all strongly support the presence of a barium star nucleus in a  70 . having detected a pn around a barium star is quite rare , however a  70 may represent an even more transient stage of stellar evolution if the secondary can be proven to be a sub - giant ( sandage et al .",
    "the evolutionary history of a  70 starts with the slightly more massive component of a binary system with a mass ratio near unity evolving through the agb , and after experiencing thermal pulses , becomes s - process enhanced . through heavy mass loss its",
    "s - process rich wind contaminated its less massive companion and reversed the mass ratio of the system to produce a barium star .",
    "the agb star then reached the pn phase , while its companion left the main sequence to become a subgiant , at which point we observe a  70  the penultimate phase in the making of a barium star ! a  70 thus represents an evolutionary stage just before webo  1 ( bond et al . 2003 ) , which is a carbon and s - process enhanced late - type giant star surrounded by a ring - like planetary nebula . similar to a  70 , webo  1 is chromospherically active and it undergoes rapid rotation every 4.7 days .",
    "such a short period , which is not expected as tidal forces should have synchronised the stars , may be due to spin - up of material accreting from the companion ( theuns et al .",
    "1996 ; jeffries & stevens 1996 ) .    given the present state of the system , we can also consider how a  70 will evolve , although the final state will depend on many parameters .",
    "in a few thousand years the nebula will disappear and the hot star will gradually cool off .",
    "soon after this the cool star will ascend the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the system will appear as a common barium star with a peculiar red giant and no visible companion . at the tip of the rgb",
    "the star will experience heavy mass loss by transferring matter to the white dwarf . during this time",
    "it may be observed as a symbiotic system where accreting matter will heat the white dwarf and ionise the wind of the cool giant .",
    "the barium stars have close ties with symbiotic stars as well as with planetary nebulae .",
    "several extrinsic s stars have been found to exhibit symbiotic - like features ( e.g. ake et al .",
    "1991 ) , while several symbiotic stars are also known to present overabundances of s - process elements ( smith et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ; pereira et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the d-type symbiotic stars are the closest relatives to barium stars ( schmid & nussbaumer 1993 ; pereira et al . 2005 ; jorissen et al . 2005 ) , especially considering some of them are surrounded by apparently _ planetary _ nebulae .",
    "schwarz ( 1991 ) discovered an inner and outer nebula around one of these , as  201 , of which the outer nebula is likely to be a pn ( ejected by the wd dwarf ) .",
    "miszalski et al .",
    "( 2011c ) found symbiotic characteristics in the galactic bulge pn m  2 - 29 , which also exhibits inner and outer nebulae , however the secondary has yet to observed against the glare of the primary .",
    "appendix [ sec : app ] describes the discovery of a bipolar nebula around hd  330036 ( cn  1 - 1 ) , which if considered to be a _ planetary _ nebula , would add further evidence to the link between barium stars with pne and barium enhanced d-type symbiotic stars .    observing a system such as a  70 implies that the initial mass ratio must have been close to unity .",
    "the rarity of such a configuration may be used as an argument against the present formation scenario , and indeed an identical approach was taken by corradi ( 2003 ) concerning the potential presence of mira secondaries in pne .",
    "such an a  70-like configuration can in principle occur since lucy ( 2006 ) found an excess of so - called twins , i.e. systems with mass ratios between 0.98 and 1 .",
    "as further binaries similar to a  70 and webo  1 are found , then these probabilities may have to be revised in favour of a greater frequency of twins .",
    "this would foster a greater overlap between symbiotic stars ( at least those of yellow or d-type ) and pne ( jorissen et al . 2005 ) , with the formal difference becoming notional .",
    "wide binaries will interact and produce genuine pne in a wide variety of cases , however only a relatively narrow range is currently observed ( e.g. de marco 2009 ) .",
    "the measurement of nebular s - process abundances in pne has considerable potential to improve agb nucleosynthesis models ( e.g. sterling & dinerstein 2008 , hereafter sd08 ; karakas et al .",
    "2009 ; karakas & lugaro 2010 ) .",
    "these abundances are a valuable constraint upon the number of third dredge - up episodes experienced during the thermally - pulsing agb phase .",
    "of particular interest are type - i pne whose he- and n - rich abundances are well - reproduced in models that require a progenitor mass @xmath14 m@xmath15 to achieve hot bottom burning . quantifying the stellar s - process abundances of a  70 via high - resolution spectroscopy will therefore be of great interest to compare against the type - i nebula abundance .",
    "the high surface brightness of a  70 compared to e.g. webo  1 may also allow nebula s - process abundances to be measured via nir spectroscopy .    in principle",
    "the s - process abundances of type - i pne should be relatively straight - forward to understand , however no firm patterns have been found so far ( karakas et al .",
    "sd08 noted that binary interactions may be responsible for reducing their measured s - process abundances , however the paucity of known binaries in their sample meant this remained untested .",
    "new discoveries of binary central stars in the sd08 sample should therefore help resolve the issue .",
    "miszalski et al . ( 2011b ) recently found a close binary in ngc  6778 which is a bipolar type - i pn in the sd08 sample with strong he and n enhancement ( he / h=0.155 and n / o=@xmath160.78 , perinotto , morbidelli & scatarzi 2004 ) .",
    "it is possible that post - ce binaries may reduce s - process abundances to a greater extent than wider binary systems , making wider binaries a potentially more reliable probe of s - process abundances in pne .",
    "the growing sample of a  70 and webo  1 as barium stars , and perhaps also me  1 - 1 , therefore provides a powerful alternative to analysis of close binaries in the sd08 sample .",
    "the discovery of the cool cspn of a  70 has important implications for further survey work to find similar binaries . to establish a physical connection between a cool cspn candidate and a pn a number of factors",
    "must be considered .",
    "the two most important being : ( i ) a uv excess or spectroscopic features of the wd must be detected to rule out the born - again scenario , and ( ii ) agreement between the radial velocities of the nebula and the cool star ( modulo the expected radial velocity amplitude of a binary ) .",
    "it is also preferable to have a small nebular diameter or equivalently an uncrowded field to help rule out a superposition ( e.g. ciardullo et al .",
    "a favourable spectroscopic distance should also preferably agree well with the approximate statistical nebula distance .",
    "a general lack of deep enough uv observations has made the task of confirming hot components in pne difficult .",
    "sahai et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found 9/21 agb stars to have fuv excesses which they attribute to a hot companion , but there has not been a systematic uv - excess survey of pne .",
    "the only other object studied so far is k  1 - 6 ( frew et al . 2011 ) , however no spectroscopic data were presented in this study .",
    "we also advise against searching too hard for a cool companion , especially in large pne where many candidates may be present .",
    "it is certainly possible that an intrinsically very faint @xmath17 mag single wd nucleus may be beyond the detection limit of typical optical surveys , and this is especially true for the most distant pne .",
    "this emphasises the crucial role of uv photometry to confirm such a  70-like binaries if they were located in more crowded stellar fields .",
    "on the other hand , the unique spectroscopic signature of a barium star is also a sound means to secure a binary confirmation and multi - object spectroscopy may be an efficient tool in this respect .",
    "we have presented 8-m optical spectroscopic and imaging observations of the unique diamond - ring pn a  70 . combined with _",
    "uv photometry , the data prove the binary nature of the central star which is expected to have an expected orbital period of a few hundred days .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * optical spectroscopy of the central star revealed a g8iv - v star , slightly enhanced in s - process elements , with chromospheric h@xmath1 emission .",
    "_ galex _ uv photometry detected the signature of a wd coincident with the central star , therefore providing the first clear proof for a barium dwarf binary inside a pn .",
    "this is firm evidence for the standard formation scenario of barium stars since barium dwarfs are generally difficult to observe ( e.g. gray et al .",
    "* radial velocities of the g8iv - v secondary were analysed in comparison to the @xmath18 km / s heliocentric nebula velocity of a  70 .",
    "fors2 observations are consistent with the nebula velocity proving they are physically connected , while one gmos observation presented a difference of 24 km / s .",
    "such a difference is of the same magnitude expected for orbital motion , if indeed this one measurement can be trusted .",
    "further observations are required at higher resolution to measure the orbital period and rv amplitude . *",
    "chemical abundances of the nebula were measured and found to have a type - i composition with strong he and n enrichment .",
    "as the g8iv - v companion is also s - process enhanced , this makes a  70 an exceptional laboratory for further improving our understanding of agb nucleosynthesis and the origin of type - i pne ( e.g. karakas et al . 2009 ) . *",
    "the distance remains uncertain , however it is clear that the wd has evolved onto the cooling track .",
    "a plausible 5 kpc distance would imply a height below the galactic plane of @xmath19 kpc , in contradiction with the type - i composition and the only slightly sub - solar oxygen abundance ( @xmath13 dex c.f .",
    "solar ) . it may be possible",
    "that a thick disk origin or binary stellar evolution could explain the type - i composition , but this remains to be proven with improved observations .",
    "* a  70 is one of very few pne with apparently cool central stars to have the wd detected in the uv .",
    "the observations presented here strongly suggest that insensitive uv observations were responsible for the non - detections of bond & pollacco ( 2002 ) and the conclusion that the companions are single nuclei caught during the ` born - again ' phase .",
    "a  70 also serves as a template to guide future discoveries of similar binary central stars .",

    "<S> the secondary shows ba  ii and sr  ii features enhanced for its spectral type that , combined with the chromospheric h@xmath1 emission and possible 2030 km / s radial velocity amplitude , firmly classifies the binary as a barium star . the proposed origin of barium stars is intimately linked to pne whereby wind accretion pollutes the companion with dredged - up material rich in carbon and s - process elements when the primary is experiencing thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . </S>",
    "<S> a  70 provides further evidence for this scenario together with the other very few examples of barium central stars . </S>",
    "<S> the nebula is found to have type - i chemical abundances with helium and nitrogen enrichment , which when combined with future abundance studies of the central star , will establish a  70 as a unique laboratory for studying s - process agb nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss guidelines to discover more binary central stars with cool secondaries in large orbits that are required to balance our knowledge of binarity in pne against the currently better studied post common - envelope binary central stars .    </S>",
