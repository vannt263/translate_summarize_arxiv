    "after the seminal work of burbidge @xcite , the method of creation of heavy elements through the slow neutron capture or s - process has been firmly established . a recent review that discusses our current understanding of the s - process may be found in kppeler @xcite it is now understood that a major fraction of the nuclear abundance in the mass region @xmath1 is due to the main s - process which takes place in he shells in low - mass agb stars of moderate mass .",
    "the role of the neutron capture reaction in s - process has been explored in many works .",
    "more accurate measurements have shown the inadequacy of the classical site - independent s - process and have paved the way to coupling with stellar models .",
    "a mass region , where the reaction cross - section plays a very important role , lies near the @xmath0 shell closure . here ,",
    "the elements ba ( @xmath2 ) to sm ( @xmath3 have small cross - sections for neutron capture reactions because of the proximity of the shell - closure . hence , they act as bottle - necks for the s - process reaction path .",
    "an s - process peak occurs at @xmath4ba .",
    "there are several s - only nuclides such as @xmath5ba , @xmath6nd , and @xmath7sm in this mass region . in the case of pairs of s - only isotopes such as @xmath5ba , the cross - sections and the abundances",
    "can be used to obtain the branching ratios of the s - process .",
    "nuclei on the s - process path that have comparable beta decay rates and neutron capture rates act as branch points as the nucleosynthesis path bifurcates towards both the proton and neutron rich sides while passing through them .",
    "the cross - sections at the branch points and s - only isotopes can provide important clues to the physical environments where the s - process takes place .",
    "although experimental measurements are available for many isotopes in the mass region , cross - section values are required for some unstable nuclei important to determine the branching ratios .",
    "such nuclei include @xmath8cs , @xmath9ce , @xmath10nd , and @xmath11pm",
    ". we should also remember that although the classical or canonical s - process calculations use the maxwellian averaged cross - sections ( macs ) at a single thermal energy ( @xmath12 30 kev usually ) , recent approaches , which couple stellar models with the s - process network , need macs at different thermal energies .",
    "measurements are not always available and extrapolation to too distant value from the measured ones may lead to errors .",
    "theoretical calculations can supplement the experimental measurements in this regard .",
    "there are some neutron capture reactions in this mass region whose studies are relevant for the astrophysical p - process .",
    "photodissociation reactions such as @xmath13 occur in extremely hot environments .",
    "explosively burning ne / o layer in core - collapse supernovae heated by the outgoing shock - wave may provide such an environment .",
    "cross section values are very important as various photo - dissociation reactions such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 compete at high temperature .",
    "the emitted neutrons also may be absorbed after the shock wave passes through the layer .",
    "thus it is very important to measure the cross - sections for relevant @xmath13 reactions at thermal energies .",
    "the reverse process , i.e. , @xmath16 reactions may serve the purpose .",
    "for example , dillmann @xcite studied a number of @xmath17 reactions with neutrons from the @xmath18li(@xmath19)@xmath18be reaction to simulate a maxwellian neutron distribution at 25 kev thermal energy .",
    "neutron capture reactions have been studied in various methods .",
    "older experiments usually used neutron beams of comparatively wide resolution . as the resonances in this region are narrow ( less than 1 ev ) , one gets an average cross - section in such experiments .",
    "extremely high resolution experiments using the neutron time of flight technique ( tof ) have been used to study the resonances .",
    "however , we are more interested in the maxwellian averaged cross - sections . in such cases ,",
    "the data have been compressed into coarse energy bins to obtain macs values . in some other experiments , sources of neutrons",
    "have been used that closely simulated the thermal neutron spectrum at certain temperatures .",
    "they can provide direct measurement of macs values .    in the present work ,",
    "we have studied low energy neutron capture cross - sections of the nuclei near @xmath0 . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly present our formalism . in section iii",
    ", we discuss our results for important neutron capture reactions near @xmath0 shell closure , first at various neutron energies and compare with experimental measurements .",
    "it is followed by a calculation of the macs values , first at 30 kev , and later at different thermal energies for some selected isotopes .",
    "finally we summarize our work .",
    "we have used a semi - microscopic procedure to calculate the neutron capture cross - section in the present work .",
    "this method has been followed in a number of our recent works @xcite .",
    "for example , in chakraborty @xcite , this procedure has been utilized to study proton capture reactions , important for the astrophysical p - process in mass @xmath20 region . in the present approach ,",
    "we extend it to study neutron capture reactions near @xmath0 shell closure .    to briefly describe our procedure ,",
    "we have assumed spherical symmetry for the target nuclei .",
    "the density profiles of the nuclei have been calculated in co - ordinate space in the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach using the fsu gold lagrangian density @xcite .",
    "the charge density is obtained from the point proton density considering the finite size of the proton using a standard gaussian form factor @xmath21 @xcite as follows .",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 fm is the root mean square ( r.m.s . ) charge radius of the proton .",
    "the charge density thus obtained is used to calculate r.m.s charge radii for some nuclei in and around the concerned region of shell closure to compare with experimentally available values .",
    "comparison with measured values serves as a check on the applicability and reliability of the lagrangian density used in the calculations .",
    "the nuclear density has then been folded with the ddm3y nucleon - nucleon interaction to obtain the optical model potential .",
    "the interaction at distance @xmath26 for density @xmath27 and projectile energy in centre of mass frame @xmath28 , supplemented by a zero range pseudo - potential , is given by v(r,,e)=t^m3y(r , e)g()with the m3y interaction @xcite in mev t^m3y=7999 - 2134 - 276(1-)(r)here @xmath28 is given in mev , @xmath26 in fm and @xmath29 is the mass number of the projectile .",
    "the density dependent factor is @xcite g()=c(1-^2/3 ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 taking values 2.07 and 1.624@xmath32 , respectively , obtained from nuclear matter calculation @xcite .",
    "we also use an additional spin - orbit potential @xmath33 with energy dependent phenomenological potential depths @xmath34 and @xmath35 according to scheerbaum prescription @xcite , given by @xmath36 with , _ vso=130exp(-0.013e)+40 + _ wso = -0.2(e-20 )    the ddm3y interaction provides only the real part of the potential . the imaginary part of the potential is taken to be identical with the real part .",
    "this optical model potential has been used to study the neutron capture reaction cross - sections .",
    "the computer code talys1.6 @xcite has been used for cross - section calculations . microscopic level densities , which are important ingredients in statistical model calculations of reaction cross - sections , are taken from the calculations of goriely included in the code .",
    "the @xmath37-strength functions for the dominant e1 @xmath37 transitions , are taken from goriely s hybrid model @xcite .",
    "width fluctuation corrections in compound nuclear decay are also considered .",
    "these are especially important near threshold energy of new channel openings where channel strengths differ significantly .",
    "radial densities are taken from rmf calculations . pairing energy correction",
    "has also been included . at low incident energies , _",
    "i.e. _ below a few mev , mainly binary reactions occur and very often the target and compound nuclei only are involved in the whole reaction chain .",
    "a maximum of 30 discrete levels are taken for both target nuclei and residual nuclei .",
    "hauser - feshbach calculations are performed with full @xmath38 coupling .",
    "all these options are included in talys code .",
    "the most important rmf result relevant to the calculation of neutron capture in the present formalism is the density profile .",
    "experimental results on density are available for three nuclei with @xmath0 , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath4ba , @xmath6nd , and @xmath39sm . in fig .",
    "[ density ] , we plot the charge density obtained in our calculation for these three nuclei .",
    "the experimental densities for @xmath4ba and @xmath6nd have been generated from the parameters for a three parameter gaussian function fitted to describe the electron scattering data of heisenberg @xcite for @xmath39sm , the fourier - bessel coefficients obtained from fitting the experimental results of moinester @xcite have been used .",
    "-4 cm   nuclei .",
    "solid lines denote the model values using the parameters obtained from fitting the experimental data .",
    "dashed lines indicate our results.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .charge radii of the nuclei studied in the present work .",
    "experimental charge radii values are from the compilation of angeli @xcite .",
    "[ chrad ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     kppeler measured the cross - sections for stable ce isotopes @xcite .",
    "they then constructed an optical model potential for this region and calculated the cross - sections for @xmath9la and @xmath40pr in the hauser - feshbach formalism .",
    "their calculated values for these two nuclei at 30 kev are 91 mb , 297 mb , and 205 mb , respectively .",
    "although their results for @xmath41ce and @xmath9pr are very close to our calculations , the value for @xmath9ce is smaller by more than a factor of two while that for @xmath40pr is larger by more than 25% and 20% , respectively .",
    "the results for la and pr isotopes are also close to experimental measurements . the nucleus @xmath4la is produced in the p - process .",
    "however , results for more neutron deficient ce isotopes do not agree well with experiments .    as one goes to heavier isotopes , agreement becomes poorer except in a few cases such as @xmath39nd and @xmath39sm , though they are still better than the most calculation .",
    "in general , the poor agreements may be due to the fact that away from the closed shell , deformation effects come into the picture . however , our calculation is unable to explain the recent results for @xmath6nd , a spherical nucleus with @xmath0 , though some of the older measurements for @xmath6nd are closer to our calculation .",
    "results for all the other nuclei with @xmath0 are explained with a good accuracy .    as already pointed out ,",
    "modern measurements have emphasized the importance of the macs values at various thermal energies .",
    "hence a number of works , apart from the already mentioned , have measured the macs values at different temperatures .",
    "we present the macs values at different temperatures for @xmath0 isotopes in table [ la139 ] and draw attention to some important results .",
    "heil @xcite have used neutron activation studies to measure the macs value at @xmath42 kev as @xmath43 mb in @xmath4ba . in the present work ,",
    "macs for @xmath4ba is calculated to be 10.2 mb at @xmath44 kev .",
    "natural lanthanum is nearly mono - isotopic .",
    "it is an important element as it can be easily detected in solar spectroscopy .",
    "it is produced in both s- and r - processes and is particularly suitable for monitoring s - process abundances from ba to pb .",
    "this has led to the study of @xmath45la through neutron tof spectroscopy as well as activation measurement . in table",
    "[ la139 ] , we present the macs values at different temperatures . obrien have measured the maxwellian averaged cross - section ( macs ) at @xmath46 kev as 31.6@xmath47 mb @xcite .",
    "our calculated value of @xmath48 mb agrees with the measurements .",
    "activation technique has also been used to measure macs at @xmath49 kev .",
    "the measured value 113.7@xmath504.0 @xcite is in excellent agreement with our calculation .",
    "terlizzi have measured the resonance parameters in the energy range 0.6 ev to 9 ev and have recalculated the macs values in the light of their measurements @xcite .",
    "their values also lie close to our calculated results .",
    "for example , their measurement yields a value of @xmath51 mb at @xmath49 kev after normalization to the value for 25 kev from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "kppeler @xcite also used the @xmath18li(@xmath19)@xmath18be reaction to study the thermal neutron capture by ce isotopes at 25 kev .",
    "they obtained a macs value of 12.0@xmath52 mb .",
    "this was extrapolated to other thermal energy values .",
    "as already mentioned , voss @xcite have obtained the macs values as a function of temperature for @xmath9pr .    as already mentioned , wisshak @xcite studied the neutron capture cross sections of nd isotopes .",
    "they have also calculated the macs values at different energy from their data .",
    "guber @xcite also measured the macs values between @xmath53 = 5 - 50 kev .",
    "both the above references have commented on the importance of the new measurements in s - process .",
    "to summarize , astrophysically important neutron capture reactions near the @xmath0 shell closure have been studied using a microscopic approach .",
    "densities of relevant nuclei near have been calculated in the rmf approach .",
    "the calculated charge densities and radii agree with experimental measurements , whenever available .",
    "the calculated density has been folded with ddm3y nucleon - nucleon interaction to obtain the optical model potential for neutron reactions .",
    "cross sections for @xmath17 reactions have been calculated and compared with measurements .",
