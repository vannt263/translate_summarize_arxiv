    "interest in the search for additional information in the hadron component of eas at mountain altitude in terms of very high energy interactions @xcite has been spurred by the necessity to have a continuity of multiproduction features between present colliders at @xmath3  1.8  tev and the future lhc high energy physics at @xmath4  =  16  tev ( @xmath4 represents here the centre of mass energy for the nucleon ",
    "nucleon collision ) .",
    "we review here the data obtained from calorimeters , or equivalent detectors , on high energy hadrons ( longitudinal development and lateral spread ) coupled with air shower arrays , where the primary energy is estimated from the electron and the muon components .    from qualitative considerations , the most energetic hadrons ( @xmath5 )",
    "can be supposed to conserve some significant properties correlated with the dynamics of the earliest interactions : for instance , the relation between the transverse momentum @xmath6 , the height h of the interaction , the hadron energy @xmath7 and the radial distance @xmath8 ,    @xmath9    has been suggested as a possible measure of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "+ following this line of inquiry , special attention has been given to the measurements of quantities like @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 ( where @xmath12 are the mean values per hadron ",
    "see @xcite ) and @xmath13 , the number of hadrons above the energy threshold @xmath14 . a convergent and significant increase of @xmath1",
    "was observed in the different experiments @xcite and the earliest interpretation was a tremendous rise of the transverse momentum @xmath15 , above @xmath4  =  5000  gev , the minimum for @xmath6 ( occuring from equation 1 when the hadrons come directly from the first interaction ) being situated around 2  gev / c @xcite .",
    "+ in more recent analysis measurements of hadron lateral distribution in tien shan calorimeter ( which unfortunately have never been repeated @xcite ) have been interpreted in terms of increasing role of high @xmath6 processes @xcite .",
    "the problem still remains open , since the number of reports on the subjest is small and measurements of hadrons suffer more than other eas components from systematic errors which have to be carefully estimated , using simulations of the detector response \" @xcite .    in parallel with our review of the experimental data , we have carried out eas simulations with the program corsika version 4.50 @xcite , regarded as containing the major features of the present collider physics , in the energy range 10@xmath16  10@xmath17  gev .",
    "our analysis has concentrated on the hadron lateral spread to explain the specific effects on the different factors combined in @xmath10 , such as the sum of energy deposited , @xmath18 , the hadron distance , @xmath8 , and the hadron content @xmath13 ( with consequences for the containment as well as the resolution of the detector ) . in order to appreciate the complexity of the hadron cascade mechanism , and",
    "how it can conserve or smear out the original interaction characteristics , the progression of our analysis is organized as follows :    * physical dependence of interaction parameters ( multiplicity , inelasticity , @xmath6 distribution .... ) * dependence on primary spectrum and composition * dependence on data acquisition and experimental resolution .",
    "the survey of this dependence has focused on the largest detector employed , i.e. the tien shan calorimeter of 36  m@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the angular emission of secondary hadrons depends on the ratio @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is longitudinal momentum in laboratory system .",
    "its evolution from cm frame to laboratory system is dominated , after lorentz transformation , by the well known collimation effect \" , the emitted jet becoming narrower as the hadron energy increases .",
    "the multiplicity grows as @xmath22 , inelasticity changes slowly and @xmath6 rises regularly @xcite , but in reasonable proportion ( circle shape points in figure  [ fig : ptve ] ) .",
    "+    other effects , such as the increase in @xmath6 for p  a collisions or a  a collisions ( as described for the cronin effect \" by schmidt and schukraft @xcite ) , or correlated with jet production , or the increase in @xmath6 for diffractive events @xcite are not very important or can be disregarded according to their respective cross sections .",
    "the correlation between @xmath15 and multiplicity ( or central rapidity density @xmath23 ) can not be neglected in the treatment of individual events more correlated with the semi  inclusive data ; the correlation of the ua1 experiment , described in @xcite , is included in corsika package ( for the option hdpm ) and has been used , without change , in the main part of our simulation .",
    "we have , nevertheless , performed some simulations with a @xmath6 generator following the most recent correlation @xmath15 with @xmath23 from the cern ua1 mimi collaboration @xcite , characterized by a greater rise of @xmath15 at large multiplicity . in this way , we ascertained that the subsequent relative changes in @xmath24 are of second order when compared to the attempt to explain @xmath24 with @xmath15 values exceeding 2  gev / c at @xmath4  =  5  tev @xcite ( squares on figure  [ fig : ptve ] ) .",

    "this effect will be even greater than in the tien shan ionization calorimeter in all the other detectors quoted .",
    "the values of @xmath14 correspond to larger hadron densities near the axis , increasing the probability of aggregation in the same chamber bin . also for larger resolution distance ( i.e. wider bins )",
    "this probability increases .",
    "+ the simulation suggests that the hadron component and its lateral spread needs to be measured with more accurate calorimeters and a resolution distance substantially smaller than 25  cm .",
    "+ we have shown that the rise @xmath24 is a consequence only of the complex treatment of the data which is inadequate for the superposition of hadrons , and the rise of @xmath15 derived from @xmath24 and shown in the figure  [ fig : ptve ] is not valid .",
    "the lateral spread of muons above 200 and 500  gev , also correlated with @xmath15 in earliest interactions , does nt require such an enhancement of @xmath15 @xcite ; the main bulk of these lateral muon distributions being explained with a constant value of @xmath15  =  0.4  gev / c @xcite .    as follows from our simulations ,",
    "even if @xmath15 is rising with energy , the hints in @xmath37 and @xmath24 can not be expected to reflect the @xmath6 behaviour , as they depend on several factors of the hadron cascade developement .    to explain the enhancement in figure  [ fig : ervne ] , an extremely large increase in primary mass , proportional to the primary energy ,",
    "was introduced in the simulation @xcite to transform the general decrease of @xmath24 versus @xmath28 in a visible increase .",
    "such conjectures are no longer necessary and the agreement can be obtained without a large increase of the primary mass .",
    "+ the @xmath6 dependence used here in the 3 options of corsika covers a wide range of models ; for instance , the values of @xmath6 in option 2 are very close to the values used in sybill @xcite as shown in @xcite by knapp , heck and schatz , and we can conclude that the present measurements of hadrons at mountain altitudes are in agreement with a majority of models used in eas simulations .",
    "they require neither a large @xmath15 enhancement nor a noticeable increase of primary mass .",
    "their significance will remain limited until the resolution distance of the detectors is seriously improved . as it was advanced by clay @xcite",
