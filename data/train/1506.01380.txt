    ", we measure the half - light radius , encapsulating half the sources integrated light .",
    "the corresponding parameter in galfit is the half - light radius along the semi - major axis ( @xmath39 ) , which can be converted to circularized effective radius ( @xmath40 ) , with @xmath41 the axis ratio .",
    "we manually subtracted the background in each image stamp , masking sources and using the mode of the pixel flux distribution .",

    "if @xmath49 reached the extreme value @xmath51 or @xmath52 , galfit was rerun while forcing @xmath53 for star - forming and @xmath54 for quiescent galaxies .",
    "these values correspond to the median @xmath49 of galaxies with well - constrained fits and @xmath55 .    at @xmath3",
    ", this happens for @xmath56 quiescent and @xmath57 star - forming galaxies . to explore systematic effects introduced by the choice of profile ,",
    "we set @xmath58 or @xmath59 for bright ( @xmath60 ) and compact sources ( @xmath45 ) and find on average @xmath61 , corresponding to a systematic uncertainty of @xmath62 .",
    "we add this in quadrature to the uncertainties from the monte carlo procedure for each galaxy .",
    "systematic biases of this level do not affect the main results . for comparison , @xcite derived typical systematic uncertainties on size of @xmath63 for faint f160w@xmath64 and small @xmath65 galaxies",
    ".    as many galaxies have modest snr , we tested the reliability of our measurements by a simulation , in which we inserted source models , convolved with the instrument psf , in the f160w images .",

    "we find @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 the input and output effective radii , showing that we can recover the sizes of faint compact sources without bias . as an additional test",
    "we determine the size distribution of point sources , by inserting psfs in the images and measuring their size .",
    "we can constrain the size of bright objects to @xmath71 at 95% confidence , which we adopt as a minimum uncertainty on the sizes .",
    "we crossmatched our sample at @xmath72 with the size catalogs of @xcite , based on the 3d@xmath73hst photometric catalogs @xcite .",

    ".               we also measure the average sizes by stacking the background subtracted image stamps of the two subsamples , normalizing each by mean stellar mass .",
    "neighbouring sources were masked .",
    "the final stacks were obtained by calculating the mean value at each pixel location of the image stamps .",
    "we ran galfit using the same input parameters as for the individual galaxies .",
    "errors were estimated by bootstrapping , i.e. randomly selecting galaxies , recreating the image stacks and rerunning galfit .    in figure [",
    "fig : fig1 ] we show the stacks and examples of individual galaxies .",
    "the stack of quiescent galaxies is redder than the stack of star - forming galaxies and has a more compact morphology .",
    "we also show stellar mass surface density profiles ( @xmath80 ) , obtained from the light profile measured in concentric apertures of radius @xmath81 and assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio . for the stacked profiles we used the mean mass of the galaxies in each stack .",
    "they are consistent with the individual profiles within the uncertainties , suggesting that the stack does not reveal an extended low surface brightness component , down to a surface brightness limit of @xmath82 .",
    "a substantial fraction of sources show signs of agn activity either from x@xmath73ray detections or strong @xmath83 ( rest - frame @xmath84 , tracing hot dust ) . as wfc3/f160w ( @xmath85 ) corresponds to rest - frame @xmath86 ( uv ) at @xmath1 , it could be that an agn is dominating their central light , leading to small sizes of the single  fits .    in the quiescent sample",
    "we find four x@xmath73ray detected galaxies , two of which are spectroscopically confirmed type - ii qsos @xcite .",
    "another has strong @xmath83 , which could either point towards dust - obscured star - formation or agn activity .",
    "several have small positive residuals after subtracting the best fit , suggesting the presence of a central point source . these @xmath2 ( 31% )",
    "galaxies were re - fit with two components , a  model and a pointsource - like model ( represented by a gaussian with fwhm@xmath87pixels ) to trace possible agn light . in these models ,",
    "the point source accounts for @xmath88 of the total light ( with @xmath89% and @xmath90% for the type - ii qsos , but on average @xmath91% for the remaining 3 agn candidates ) .",
    "the average size of the  component increases by @xmath92 ( from a median @xmath93 to @xmath94 ) .    amongst the star - forming galaxies two are x@xmath73ray detected , and four are very bright at @xmath83 ( l@xmath95 or @xmath96 ) .",
    "re - fitting with a two - component model attributes @xmath97 of the light to a point source , while the extended component changes in size by @xmath98 ( from @xmath99 to @xmath100 ) .",
    "we note that for the most extended sources , adding central light reduces the  index @xmath101 of the extended component , and can result in a smaller @xmath102 .",
    "we additionally estimated the possible agn contribution from the galaxy seds .",
    "we first determine the best fitting powerlaw bluewards of rest - frame @xmath103 and at observed @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "then we fit the sum of the powerlaw and the original best - fit eazy template to the data .",
    "the contribution of the agn powerlaw template to f160w is @xmath105 for the 5 quiescent galaxies and @xmath106 for the 6 star - forming galaxies .    while the two - component fits and seds indicate that a point source contribution is probably small , the true contribution and its effect on the sizes remain unclear .",
    "we show the effective radius as a function of stellar mass in figure [ fig : msize ] .",
    "quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 are very compact , with a bootstrapped median size .",
    "when we remove agn we find a similar result : .",
    "star - forming galaxies have .",
    "they are  larger than quiescent galaxies .",
    "both samples have a large spread in size , with some almost as large as at @xmath4 , showing that at @xmath3 the population is already very diverse . on average the sizes lie well below the @xmath4 relation @xcite , by  for quiescent and for star - forming galaxies .",
    "quiescent galaxies are also smaller than at @xmath107 .        in figure",
    "[ fig : sb ] we show  index versus size for the @xmath3 galaxies , and a sample at similar mass at @xmath107 .",
    "star - forming galaxies have smaller  index , with on average @xmath108 , compared to @xmath109 for quiescent galaxies . the difference between the two populations",
    "is also clear from the stellar mass density profiles in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , with quiescent galaxies having steeper profiles and more centralized flux . in figure",
    "[ fig : sb ] we also plot @xmath110 , defined as the average stellar mass density inside the radius where @xmath111 falls of by a factor of two @xcite , with uncertainties from the monte carlo procedure described in section [ sec : gf ] .",
    "quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 have a median , much higher ( @xmath112 ) than for star - forming galaxies : , and more similar to @xmath107 quiescent galaxies : .",
    "when stacking we find  ( quiescent ) and  ( star - forming ) , and  indices  and , respectively .",
    "the effective radius of the quiescent stack is slightly larger than the median of the individual galaxies , by @xmath113 at @xmath114 significance , but overall the results are consistent .",
    "[ fig : rz ]    in figure [ fig : rz ] we show the median sizes at the respective mean redshifts of the two subsamples . comparing with lower redshift , they continue to follow a trend of decreasing size with increasing redshift .",
    "our control sample of galaxies at @xmath37 with @xmath115 corresponds well with the results of @xcite , which suggest the same trend .",
    "we fit a relation of the form @xmath116kpc at @xmath117 , using the measurements of @xcite at @xmath118 .",
    "we find  for quiescent and  for star - forming galaxies .",
    "we note that our sample at @xmath3 includes higher mass ( @xmath119 ) galaxies .",
    "if we remove the most massive galaxies , we find the same evolutionary relation .    to test for incompleteness for diffuse galaxies , we redshift a stellar - mass matched sample with @xmath120kpc and @xmath121 at @xmath122 to @xmath123 and find 70% completeness .",
    "our results show that the galaxies at @xmath3 in this study obey similar relations between size and star - forming activity as galaxies at lower redshift .",
    "quiescent galaxies are compact , while star - forming galaxies are more extended and diffuse .",
    "the difference is also clear when selecting purely on size : if we define compactness as @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath124 ( 93% ) of massive compact galaxies would be classified as quiescent , and @xmath125 ( 81% ) of larger galaxies as star - forming ( figure [ fig : sb ] ) .",
    "the number density of compact , , quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 is @xmath10 , increasing by @xmath11 between @xmath1 and @xmath107 , towards @xmath126 .",
    "this suggests we are probing a key era of their formation , and we would expect to see their star - forming progenitors in abundance .",
    "small effective radii for star - forming galaxies have been reported at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "they are rare in our sample : we find 1/14 with @xmath8 .",
    "on average , star - forming galaxies at @xmath3 are twice as large as quiescent galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "if they are the direct progenitors of @xmath127 compact quiescent galaxies , we expect them to be similar , not only in size , but also in  index and central surface density @xcite .",
    "however , we find smaller @xmath101 for star - forming galaxies , while the central densities indicate that they must increase in @xmath110 by @xmath128 , to match the more cuspy profiles of @xmath129 quiescent galaxies .    in a recent simulation , ( ilustris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) trace the evolution of galaxies to @xmath130 .",
    "they indeed identified two theoretical formation tracks : one in which a brief and intense central starburst prompted by a gas - rich major merger causes the galaxies half - mass radius to decrease dramatically .",
    "the second is that of a more gradual but early formation , with small galaxy sizes due to the higher density of the universe . in the second case ,",
    "nearly all of the stellar mass is in place at @xmath131 .    comparing with the observations",
    ", we find that 19/44 of massive @xmath3 galaxies are classified as quiescent , whereas all similarly massive galaxies in illustris are still actively star - forming , with a typical @xmath132 .",
    "this level of star - formation is ruled out at @xmath133 by herschel observations of the @xmath3 quiescent galaxies @xcite . at the same time , the fraction of compact galaxies in our sample is 47% , versus @xmath134 in illustris . hence massive galaxies appear to quench their star - formation earlier and to be more compact than in simulations .",
    "the paucity of compact star - forming galaxies at @xmath3 and their large median rest - frame uv size is puzzling . at face value",
    "it suggests that the rapid increase in number density of compact quiescent galaxies can not be explained by simple shutdown of star - formation in typical star - forming galaxies of similar stellar mass .",
    "a possible solution is a rapidly forming dense core , i.e. a central starburst .",
    "then the chance to observe the progenitors in our sample is small , as it is proportional to the duration of the main star - forming episode .",
    "for example , if compact cores of @xmath107 quiescent galaxies formed at random times between @xmath135 , with a typical 100myr central starburst duration , their predicted number density at @xmath3 would be @xmath136 .",
    "the observed number density of compact star - forming galaxies is @xmath137 : smaller , but in a similar range given the large uncertainties .",
    "we note that the remarkably high fraction of quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 ( figure [ fig : rz ] ) is still uncertain .",
    "current limits on the average dust - obscured sfr are weak ( @xmath138 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hence some of the quiescent galaxies could be star - forming .",
    "cosmic variance is significant ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "highly obscured massive star - forming galaxies might also be missed by near - ir surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the abundance and redshift distribution of such galaxies is still very uncertain .",
    "finally , extended ( @xmath140kpc ) galaxies with small @xmath49 and low surface brightness are more difficult to detect than compact galaxies ( e.g. trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we caution that the light profiles measured here may not be representative of the stellar mass distribution due to color gradients , with rest - frame uv sizes larger than rest - frame optical sizes .",
    "this would imply that the size evolution is stronger .",
    "however , using control sample at @xmath15 , we find no difference between uv and optical , consistent with @xcite , who show this effect is @xmath141 at @xmath5 and decreasing with redshift .",
    "galaxy sizes may also be overestimated if dust is obscuring a central starburst .",
    "submm sizes of obscured starbursting galaxies could be small : @xmath142kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a direct comparison of alma submm and rest - frame optical / uv morphologies for the same objects with measured stellar mass will reveal the effect of dust obscuration on uv / optically measured galaxy sizes",
