    "exclusive production of the higgs boson can be an alternative to the present studies of higgs in inclusive processes .",
    "there is recently a growing theoretical interest in studying exclusive processes .",
    "only a few processes have been measured so far , mostly at the tevatron ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "khoze , martin and ryskin developed an approach in the language of off - diagonal unintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "this approach was applied to exclusive production of higgs boson @xcite . in our recent papers",
    "we applied the same formalism to exclusive production of @xmath0 and @xmath2 quarks .",
    "quite large cross sections have been found @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the standard model higgs production is of the order of 1 fb for light higgs @xcite .",
    "the dominant @xmath2 decay channel is therefore preferential from the point of view of statistics .",
    "it was argued that the leading - order contribution is rather small using a so - called @xmath6 = 0 rule .",
    "here we show a quantitative calculation which goes beyond this simple rule . in our calculation",
    "we include exact matrix element for massive quarks and the 2 @xmath7 4 phase space .",
    "this fully four - body calculation allows to impose cuts on kinematical variables .",
    "different types of backgrounds to higgs production were studied before e.g. in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us concentrate on the simplest case of the production of @xmath8 pair in the color singlet state .",
    "color octet state would demand an emission of an extra gluon which considerably complicates the calculations .",
    "we do not consider the @xmath9 contribution as it is higher order compared to the one considered here .",
    "we write the amplitude of the exclusive diffractive @xmath8 pair production @xmath10 in the color singlet state as + @xmath11 where @xmath12 are helicities of heavy @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . above @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "are the off - diagonal unintegrated gluon distributions in nucleon 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fractions of active gluons are calculated based on kinematical variables of outgoing quark and antiquark : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are transverse masses of the quark and antiquark , respectively , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are corresponding rapidities .    the bare amplitude above is subjected to absorption corrections . the absorption corrections are taken here in a simple multiplicative form .",
    "let us consider the subprocess amplitude for the @xmath8 pair production via off - shell gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the vertex factor @xmath23 in expression ( [ amplitude ] ) is the production amplitude of a pair of massive quark @xmath13 and antiquark @xmath14 with helicities @xmath24 , @xmath25 and momenta @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the color singlet @xmath8 pair production amplitude can be written as @xcite @xmath28 the tensorial part of the amplitude reads : @xmath29 the coupling constants @xmath30 . in the present calculation",
    "we take the renormalization scale to be @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "the exact matrix element is calculated numerically .",
    "analytical formulae are shown explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal parton distributions ( i=1,2 ) are calculated as @xmath33}{d \\log k_t^2 } |_{k_t^2 = q_{it}^2 } \\ ; f(t_i ) \\end{array } \\label{kmr - off - diagonal - ugdfs}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a sudakov - like form factor relevant for the case under consideration .",
    "it is reasonable to take a running ( factorization ) scale as : @xmath35 or @xmath32 .",
    "the factor @xmath36 here can not be calculated from first principles in the most general case of off - diagonal ugdfs .",
    "it can be estimated in the case of off - diagonal collinear pdfs when @xmath37 and @xmath38 . then @xmath39 .",
    "typically @xmath40 1.3  1.4 at the tevatron energy .",
    "the off - diagonal form factors are parametrized here as @xmath41 . in practical calculations",
    "we take @xmath42 = 2 gev@xmath43 . in the original kmr approach the following prescription for the effective transverse momentum",
    "is taken : @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in evaluating @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath47 needed for calculating the amplitude ( [ amplitude ] ) we use different collinear distributions .",
    "it was proposed @xcite to express the @xmath48 form factors in eq .",
    "( [ kmr - off - diagonal - ugdfs ] ) through the standard sudakov form factors as : @xmath49 the cross section for the four - body reaction is calculated as @xmath50 the details how to conveniently reduce the number of kinematical integration variables are given elsewhere .",
    "let us proceed now with the presentation of differential distributions of charm quarks produced in the edd mechanism .",
    "in this case we have fixed the scale of the sudakov form factor to be @xmath52 .",
    "such a choice of the scale leads to a strong damping of the cases with large rapidity gaps between @xmath13 and @xmath53 .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figx ] we show distribution in rapidity .",
    "the results obtained with the kmr method are shown together with inclusive gluon - gluon contribution .",
    "the effect of absorption leads to a damping of the cross section by an energy - dependent factor . for the tevatron this factor is about 0.1 .",
    "if the extra factor is taken into account the edd contribution is of the order of 1% of the dominant gluon - gluon fusion contribution .",
    "the corresponding rapidity - integrated cross section at @xmath1 = 1960 gev is : 6.6 @xmath54b for the exact formula , 2.4 @xmath54b for the simplified formula ( see eq .",

    "the details of the off - shell matrix element can be found in ref .",
    "in contrast to the exclusive @xmath62 production @xcite , due to a large factorization scale @xmath63 the off - shell effects for @xmath61 give only a few percents .",

    "[ fig : dsigma_dmbb_pdfs ] we show the most essential distribution in the invariant mass of the centrally produced @xmath2 pair , which is also being the missing mass of the two outgoing protons . in this calculation",

    "we show results with different collinear gluon distributions from the literature : grv @xcite , cteq @xcite , gjr @xcite and mstw @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with radiatively generated gluon distributions ( grv , gjr ) allow to use low values of @xmath72 whereas for other gluon distributions an upper cut on @xmath73 is necessary .",
    "the lowest curve in fig.[fig : dsigma_dmbb_pdfs ] represents the @xmath74 contribution @xcite .",
    "while the integrated over phase space @xmath74 contribution is rather small , it is significant compared to the double - diffractive component at large @xmath75 100 gev .",
    "this can be understood by a damping of the double diffractive component at large @xmath76 by the sudakov form factor @xcite . in addition , in contrast to the double - diffractive component the absorption for the @xmath74 component is very small and in practice can be neglected .    in the left panel of fig.[fig : dsigma_dmbb_fully ] we show the double diffractive contribution for a selected ( cteq6 @xcite ) collinear gluon distribution and the contribution from the decay of the higgs boson including natural decay width calculated as in ref .",

    "the phase space integrated cross section for the higgs production , including absorption effects with @xmath77 is somewhat less than 1 fb . the result shown in fig.[fig : dsigma_dmbb_fully ] includes also the branching fraction for br(@xmath78 0.8 and the rapidity restrictions .",
    "the second much broader breit - wigner type peak corresponds to the exclusive production of the @xmath79 boson with the cross section calculated as in ref .",
    "the exclusive cross section for @xmath1 = 14 tev is 16.61 fb including absorption .",
    "the branching fraction br(@xmath80 0.15 has been included in addition .",
    "in contrast to the higgs case the absorption effects for the @xmath79 production are much smaller @xcite .",
    "the sharp peak corresponding to the higgs boson clearly sticks above the background . in the above calculations we have assumed an ideal measurement .    in reality",
    "the situation is , however , much worse as both protons and in particular @xmath4 and @xmath5 jets are measured with a certain precision which automatically leads to a smearing in @xmath76 .",
    "experimentally instead of @xmath76 one will measure rather two - proton missing mass ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the experimental effects are included in the simplest way by a convolution of the theoretical distributions with the gaussian smearing function @xmath82 with @xmath83 = 2 gev which is determined mainly by the precision of measuring forward protons . in the right panel",
    "we show the two - proton missing mass distribution when the smearing is included .",
    "now the bump corresponding to the higgs boson is below the @xmath2 background . with the experimental resolution assumed above the identification of",
    "the standard model higgs seems rather difficult .",
    "the situation for some scenarios beyond the standard model may be better .",
    "can the situation be improved by imposing further cuts ? in fig .",
    "[ fig : y3y4_edd ] we show the distribution for the edd background in @xmath86 and @xmath84 .",
    "in contrast to the higgs @xcite the cross section for the @xmath2 continuum has maxima far from the diagonal . this can be used to impose cuts on quark / antiquark rapidities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigma_dmbb_cuts ] ( left panel ) we show the result for a more limited range of @xmath4 and @xmath5 rapidity , i.e. not making use of the whole coverage of the main lhc detectors . here we omit the @xmath79 contribution and concentrate solely on the higgs signal .",
    "now the signal - to - background ratio is somewhat improved .",
    "this would be obviously at the expense of a deteriorated statistics .",
    "similar improvements of the signal - to - background ratio can be obtained by imposing cuts on jet transverse momenta .",
