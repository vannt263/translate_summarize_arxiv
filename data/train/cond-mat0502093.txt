    "it consists of four organic ligands ( bis(bipyridyl)-bipyrimidine ) and four transition - metal ions ( e.g. mn@xmath1 , fe@xmath1 , co@xmath1 , ni@xmath1 or zn@xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "each metal - ion is situated in an approximately octahedral environment of nitrogen atoms .",
    "the total charge 8 + of the complex is countered by anions , e.g. @xmath13 .",

    "we include the strong electrostatic interactions between electrons localized on the metal - ions and the ligands as well as the weak tunneling of electrons between them . a crucial feature of our model is that the orbital and charging energies on the ligands and ions are very different , a situation common in transition - metal complexes . we are interested in how the electron spins on the molecule couple to form the total magnetic moment and how this coupling is affected by total electron number which can be electrically controlled in a three terminal transport setup ( which is not considered here ) .",
    "the metal - ions mediate the coupling between electrons on the ligands _ and vice versa_. we also want to study the effect of an unpaired electron spin on a mediating metal - ion on the ligand - ligand spin coupling , which will in turn determine the total spin formed by the ion and ligand subsystems .",

    "the resulting maximal spin is however more than twice as large as for fe@xmath1 .",
    "the charge - sensitive spin - polarization requires a strong local coulomb charging effect and metal - to - ligand charge - transfer ( mlct ) barrier .",
    "the former can be achieved chemically by introducing electron - donating sidegroups on the ligands  @xcite . the electrochemical experiments  @xcite were performed near room temperature where thermal occupation of high - spin excited states of the metal - ions becomes possible .",

    "this offers an interesting perspective for single - molecule transport where the immediate nuclear environment of the device can be controlled at the level of chemical synthesis . + the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : el - struct ]",
    "we discuss the minimal set of orbitals involved in electron addition processes and the intramolecular magnetic coupling .",
    "this serves as a motivation for the correlated electron model which we introduce in section [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : pt ] we discuss a perturbative treatment of the ion - ligand tunneling in this model to gain a simple understanding of the role of spin degrees of freedom on the ions .",

    "we conclude with a discussion of implications for electron tunneling experiments in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we can expect that the dominant molecular orbitals ( mos ) at the fermi energy are either @xmath20-like orbitals from the metal 2 + ions or @xmath21-orbitals from the ligands .",

    "the important point is that the empty or singly occupied @xmath24-orbitals on the metal - ions have different approximate symmetry ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this means we can consider ligands and metal - ions weakly coupled systems and discuss the tunneling of electrons between them . the remaining question is whether extra electrons prefer to occupy the metal - ion @xmath20-orbitals or the ligand @xmath21-orbitals . as far as charging effects",
    "are concerned , one expects that the onsite energy @xmath27 on the metal ions is larger than the on - site energy @xmath28 on the ligands because orbitals are more contracted on the metal - ions .",
    "furthermore , electrons would favor positions between two positively charged ions , i.e. on the bridging ligand .",

    "localized spins on the mediating metal ions ( co@xmath1 ) counteract the nagaoka effect , but the direct exchange coupling with the neighboring ligands can compensate for this .",
    "the total spin in the nagaoka state for the co@xmath1 complex is therefore more than twice as large as for the fe@xmath1 complex .",
    "low temperature electron tunneling experiments can access the change of the molecular spin as a function of added charge .",
    "spin - blockade effects  @xcite will dominate the single - electron tunneling around transitions between charge states with maximal spin  @xcite .",
    "also , the @xmath90 kondo effect usually expected for odd @xmath99 will also be suppressed . in any case",
    "the nagaoka mechanism lowers maximal spin states in energy .",
    "even as low lying total - spin excitations nagaoka states have clear transport fingerprints due to spin - selection rules  @xcite .",
    "other molecular complexes can also show the above behavior .",
    "it is essential that the connectivity of the electron - accepting centers is appropriate  @xcite for the nagaoka mechanism to be effective .",

    "<S> extra electrons preferably occupy redox orbitals on the ligands . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic interactions between these ligands are mediated by transition - metal ions _ and vice versa_. using both perturbation theory and exact diagonalization we find that for certain charge states the maximally attainable total spin ( either @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) may actually be achieved . due to the nagaoka mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> all unpaired electron spins couple to a total maximal spin , including unpaired electron spins on the metal - ions in the case of co@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are chosen to be consistent with cyclovoltammetry experiments in which up to twelve redox states have been observed . </S>",
    "<S> the above effect may also be realized in other complexes with an appropriate connectivity between the redox sites . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal spin states of such a charge - switchable molecular magnet may be experimentally observed as spin - blockade effects on the electron tunneling in a three - terminal transport setup . </S>"
