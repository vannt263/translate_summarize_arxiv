    "a control of processes of quantum tunneling through potential barriers by external signals is a part of the field called quantum control which is actively developed now , see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "excitation of molecules , when one should excite only particular chemical bonds @xcite , formation of programmable atomic wave packets @xcite , a control of electron states in heterostructures @xcite , and a control of photocurrent in semiconductors @xcite , are typical examples of control by laser pulses .",
    "a control of quantum tunneling through potential barriers is also a matter of interest , since tunneling is a part of many processes in nature .",
    "the computation of probability for a classically forbidden region has a certain peculiarity from the mathematical stand point : there necessarily arises here the concept of motion in imaginary time or along a complex trajectory @xcite .",
    "the famous semiclassical approach of wentzel , kramers , and brillouin ( wkb ) @xcite for tunneling probability can be easily reformulated in terms of classical trajectories in complex time .",
    "the method of complex trajectories is also applicable to a nonstationary case @xcite .",
    "the method has been further developed in papers @xcite , where singularities of the trajectories in the complex plane were accounted for an arbitrary potential barrier ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recent achievements in the semiclassical theory are presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "let us focus on the main aspects of tunneling under nonstationary conditions . when the electric field @xmath1 acts on a tunneling particle of the initial energy @xmath2 , it can absorb the quantum @xmath3 ( with the probability proportional to the small parameter @xmath4 ) and tunnel after that in a more transparent part of the barrier with the higher energy @xmath5 .",
    "the pay in the absorption probability may be compensated by the probability gain in tunneling . in this case",
    "the system tends to absorb further quanta to increase the total probability of passing the barrier .",
    "this mechanism of barrier penetration is called photon - assisted tunneling .",
    "if @xmath3 is not big , the process of tunneling , with the simultaneous multiquanta absorption , can be described in a semiclassical way by the method of classical trajectories in the complex time @xcite .",
    "when a tunneling particle of the energy @xmath2 is acted by a short - time pulse , the tunneling probability is associated with the particle density carrying away in the outgoing wave packet .",
    "the particle energy after escape is @xmath6 , where the energy gain @xmath7 , should be extremized with respect to the number of absorbed quanta @xmath8 and the energy @xmath9 of each quantum @xcite .",
    "according to the perturbation theory , the both probabilities , of absorption and emission of quantum , are small being proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "after absorption , @xmath10 is positive which enhances the total probability due to increase of the tunneling rate .",
    "after emission , @xmath10 is negative and the particle should tunnel with a smaller energy in a less transparent part of the barrier ; in this case there is no gain in the probability due to tunneling as for absorption . at first sight ,",
    "tunneling in a nonstationary field can not be assisted by an emission of quanta of this field since one should pay in probability twice .",
    "thus , one can expect the double loss in probability due to the emission of quanta and the reduction of tunneling transparency .",
    "this conclusion is correct as soon as the nonstationary field is small and the perturbation theory is applicable .    under increase of the nonstationary field",
    "the process of tunneling with emission of quanta becomes completely different compared to one , predicted on the basis of the perturbation theory @xcite . the crucial role here plays the fact , that the non - perturbative wave function is mainly determined by its big phase ( real or imaginary ) . in this case",
    "there is no the double loss in probability .",
    "the quantum process is not simply reduced to separate emission and tunneling .",
    "however , the phase behavior can be interpreted in the way of enhancement of the total probability due to emission processes which competes now with the reduction of the tunneling transparency .",
    "the competition between the enhancement of the total probability due to emission and the reduction of it due to tunneling results in the unexpected effect : the total probability ( defined as a particle density , carrying away by the outgoing wave packet ) becomes not exponentially small for the certain particle energy @xmath11 in the well .",
    "this energy depends on parameters of the nonstationary field and in a vicinity of @xmath11 the probability sharply peaks as a function of energy .",
    "this reminds , formally , a resonant behavior and is called euclidean resonance @xcite .",
    "the energy @xmath11 can be called the resonant energy . in [ sec : eucl ] this phenomenon is deduced from the analysis of the quantum mechanical phases using only simple physical arguments .",
    "as well known , nuclear coulomb barriers may be very significant in nuclear physics , playing a role of blockade for particle approach or escape @xcite .",
    "the famous example of such a nuclear process is alpha decay of nuclei which has a small probability since the alpha particle should penetrate through a very non - transparent nuclear coulomb barrier @xcite . as any tunneling process",
    ", alpha decay can be influenced by a nonstationary field .",
    "the duration of artificially generated pulses ( see , for example , @xcite ) is too long compared to the nucleus characteristic time of @xmath12s which makes impossible their influence on alpha decay .",
    "a role of a nonstationary field can be played by a moving charged particle which collides the decaying nucleus .",
    "for example , a proton of the energy of @xmath13mev sweeps the tunneling region in , approximately , @xmath12s .",
    "an incident proton , moving towards a tunneling alpha particle , reduces its energy due to the coulomb interaction between them .",
    "since the energy is lost but not gained during tunneling , euclidean resonance may be expected . as shown below",
    ", this happens . at the certain energy of the incident",
    "proton the simultaneous tunneling of alpha particle has not an exponentially small probability , according to euclidean resonance .    in other words , due to interaction with an incident proton of the certain energy ,",
    "the alpha particle escapes the nucleus and goes to infinity with no influence of the coulomb barrier .",
    "this stimulation of alpha decay by a proton constitutes the new type of nuclear reaction .",
    "normally , nuclear reactions involve strong interaction at nuclear distances . in this case , only the short range start of the alpha particle from the nucleus is due to strong interaction and the main physics occurs further , at the larger distance where strong forces do not act and only coulomb effects are involved .",
    "this new type of nuclear reactions has a very resonant character with respect to an energy of the incident proton . as shown below",
    ", the typical resonance energy of a proton is in the range of @xmath0mev .",
    "one should emphasize , that this resonance results from solely coulomb effects in contrast , for example , to resonances in nuclear physics due to formation of compound nuclei .",
    "a penetration of a particle through a potential barrier is forbidden in classical mechanics . only due to quantum effects",
    "the probability of passing across a barrier becomes finite and it can be calculated on the basis of wkb approach , which is also called the semiclassical theory .",

    "the integration goes under the barrier between two classical turning points where @xmath17 .",
    "one can use the general estimate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the barrier height and @xmath20 is the frequency of classical oscillations in the potential well .",
    "a semiclassical barrier relates to a big value @xmath21 .",
    "what happens when the static potential barrier @xmath22 is acted by a weak nonstationary electric field @xmath23 ?",
    "in this case there are two possibilities for barrier penetration : ( i ) the conventional tunneling , which is not affected by @xmath23 , shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , and ( ii ) an absorption of the quantum @xmath3 of the field @xmath23 and subsequent tunneling with the new energy @xmath5",
    ". the latter process is called photon - assisted tunneling .",
    "the total probability of penetration across the barrier can be schematically written as a sum of two probabilities @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fourier component of the field @xmath23 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) relates to photon - assisted tunneling and it is a product of probabilities of two quantum mechanical processes : absorption of the quantum @xmath3 and tunneling through the reduced barrier @xmath26 .",
    "the length @xmath27 is a typical barrier extension in space .",
    "when the frequency is high @xmath28 , the second term starts to dominate at sufficiently small nonstationary field @xmath29 .",
    "this is a feature of tunneling processes .",
    "normally a nonstationary field starts to dominate at bigger amplitudes @xmath30 . when the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) exceeds the first one , further orders of perturbation theory should be accounted which correspond to the multiple absorption , shown in fig .",
    "[ 2](b ) .",
    "let us specify a shape of a field pulse in the form @xmath31 with the fourier component @xmath32 . in this case , in addition to the steady particle flux from the barrier ,",
    "an outgoing wave packet is created which carries away the certain particle density .",
    "then the probability @xmath33 of the transition through the process of absorption of @xmath8 quanta and subsequent tunneling with the higher energy @xmath34 , shown in fig .",
    "[ 2](b ) , is @xmath35= \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\hbar}\\hspace{0.05cm}\\theta a{\\cal e}\\right)^{2n}\\exp(-a)\\ ] ] where @xmath36 here the total energy transfer @xmath37 is introduced ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the maximum transition probability through the barrier is determined by some finite value of @xmath10 , which provides a minimum of @xmath39 and is defined by the condition @xmath40 .",
    "an existence of such a minimum is possible if a grow up of small @xmath10 reduces @xmath39 , that is , under the condition @xmath41 of sufficiently short pulses . in other words ,",
    "sufficiently short and not very small pulses ( however , still much smaller than the static barrier field ) strongly enhance tunneling by photon assistance .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) omits some details and it is rather an illustration of a tunneling mechanism with quanta absorption .",
    "for example , the accurate perturbation theory starts with the linear @xmath42-term .",
    "the exact nonperturbative theory , which is a generalization of the conventional semiclassical approach , results in the same @xmath39 .",
    "the semiclassical approach is also sensitive to the sign of @xmath42 since the classical energy transfer is determined by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a classical particle trajectory .",
    "the strong photon - assisted tunneling exists only at positive @xmath42 .",
    "besides the absorption of quanta in fig .  [ fig2 ] , also the emission is possible , shown in fig .",
    "this process is provided by negative frequencies @xmath45 and the energy transfer is also negative @xmath46 . in this case eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) gives @xmath47 which does not correspond to any extreme since @xmath48 .",
    "so , on the basis of perturbation theory , one can conclude that emission processes can not enhance a barrier penetration at least for the pulse amplitude on the border of applicability of the perturbation theory @xmath49 .",
    "may an emission process enhance a tunneling rate when the signal amplitude is not small @xmath50 ?      at the big pulse amplitude @xmath42 its contribution to the classical action , generally speaking , is big , compared to planck s constant , @xmath51 and the wave function @xmath52 is mainly determined by its big phase @xmath53 , which can be imaginary as well .",
    "another condition of a big phase is a slow varying pulse @xmath54 since a big phase should be built up during a long time . here",
    "@xmath19 is the barrier height and , therefore , @xmath55 is some intrinsic time of the problem .",
    "one has to note , that within the conditions ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) the pulse amplitude can be still less compared to the static field of the barrier @xmath56 .",
    "suppose @xmath57 and @xmath58 to relate to the classical turning points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . at @xmath59 ,",

    "@xmath23 the modulus of the wave function of the outgoing particle @xmath61 has an extreme ( maximum ) value at @xmath62 which relates to the maximum amplitude of the outgoing wave packet at @xmath63 .",
    "according to feynman @xcite , an extreme wave function corresponds to a classical trajectory of the particle connecting the points @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "but in the present situation there are no classical trajectories under a barrier .",
    "however , one can find a connection between two constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 without an exact solution of schrdinger equation .",

    "this phase connection , as follows from the solution of schrdinger equation , is applicable in our case of decay of a metastable state . but it does not mean , that its applicability is automatically valid in other situations with a big phase .",
