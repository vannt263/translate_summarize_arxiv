    "whiting1 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) is a halo globular cluster at a heliocentric distance d@xmath945kpc , as first shown by @xcite .",
    "it was discovered by @xcite during a search for galaxies in the zone of avoidance , and originally it was classified as an open cluster by @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite confirmed its association with the milky way halo with deep @xmath15 photometry , and updated the heliocentric distance to d@xmath929.4kpc .",
    "they derived an age of 6.5gyr and metallicity @xmath1=0.004@xmath00.001 from isochrone fitting and estimated a@xmath16=0.11 mag and ( m - m)@xmath17=17.34 .",
    "in latter study , measured caii indexes ( @xmath18caii ) of three stars in whiting 1 give metallicity [ fe / h ] ranging from @xmath21.1 to @xmath20.4 ( @xmath1 ranging from 0.002 to 0.008 ) .",
    "they pointed out that whiting1 is spatially close to the trailing stream of sgr dsph , and its kinematics is consistent with that of this galaxy .",
    "besides , it follows very nicely the sgr dsph age - metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "only a few globular clusters in the halo of the galaxy are known to have comparably young ages ( @xmath19 , pal1  rosenberg et al .",
    "1998a ; pal12  rosenberg et al . 1998b ; segue3",
    " ortolani et al . 2013 ; crater  belokurov et al . 2014 ) , making whiting1 a member of a rare class of objects .",
    "up to now no nir photometry of whiting1 has been reported in the literature and in this study we aim to obtain the fundamental properties through the nir cmd using data from the eso science archive . also , a search for variable star population has never been performed .",
    "the next section describes our data .",
    "section 3 , 4 and 5 present our analysis and results of the nir data : cluster structural parameters and cluster fundamental parameters - age , metallicity and distance modulus .",
    "section 6 describes our search for variable stars in @xmath6 band and our conclusions are drawn in section 7 .",
    "whiting1 was observed in the nir on 2006",
    "september 4 at the eso ntt ( new technology telescope ) with sofi ( son of isaac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in large - field imaging mode .",
    "sofi is equipped with a 1024@xmath201024 detector , with a pixel scale of 0.292arcsecpix@xmath21 and fov of 4.98 x 4.98 .",
    "we had 15 images in @xmath22 ( each was the average of 4 frames of 15sec integration ) and 32 images in @xmath23 ( each was the average of 6 frames of 10sec integration ) .",
    "the seeing during the observations was 0.8  0.9 on average for both filters .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with iraf , and included flat fielding , sky / bias / dark subtraction , image alignment and combination .",
    "the sky frame was created by median combination of all images with the task _ imcombine _ , applying the _ avsigclip _",
    "3-@xmath24 rejection algorithm , and appropriate thresholds to excise the stars .",
    "a constant was added to the sky subtracted images during the final combination to set their median value to zero , accounting for the sky variations during the observations .",
    "next , we performed psf photometry ( stetson 1987 ) with daophot / iraf .",
    "only 99 stars were measured in both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the 100% completeness limits were defined from the first drop in the luminosity function which give @xmath2519.5mag and @xmath2618.2mag ( magnitude bins varied from 0.1 to 0.3 ) , and the photometric errors for stars brighter than these limits are typically less than 0.1mag .",
    "the photometric calibration was based on 9 stars for @xmath22 , and 7 stars for @xmath23 , in common with the two micron all sky survey @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 @xmath28 where the lower case letters mark the instrumental magnitudes , and the upper case ones mark the standard magnitudes ( hereafter we will use the designation k for @xmath29 filter ) .",
    "optical images of whiting1 were collected with emmi ( eso multi - mode instrument ; dodorico 1990 ) and efosc2 ( eso faint object spectrograph and camera ; snodgrass et al .",
    "2008 ) on the 3.58-m eso ntt ( new technology telescope ) at la silla , chile , typically to fill small gaps in other programs or during periods of poor weather conditions .",
    "binning by a factor of two was used on all occasions , making the pixels scales 0.33 and 0.24arcsecpix@xmath21 and the fov 5.6 x 9.9 and 4.1 x 4.1 , respectively for both instruments .",
    "five epochs were obtained in @xmath6 band , and the first was paired with @xmath30 band for quasi - simultaneous color information .",
    "the total integration for each epoch was split into three images , taken with some offsets to minimize the effects from the detector s cosmetics .",
    "a detailed log of the observations is presented in table  [ table_obslog ] .",
    ".log of the optical monitoring observations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the differential light curves ( fig.[light_curves ] ) of the candidate variables # 359 and # 834 were generated with respect to the reference stars # 672 and # 851 which are the nearest stable stars similar in magnitude and color .",
    "the maximum peak - to - peak variation of both candidates is @xmath9 0.2 mag over the monitoring period of 35 days with available data for 4 epochs .",
    "we plotted all 273 stars with three and more epochs in @xmath6 band on cmd @xmath6 vs. @xmath31 ( see fig.[cmd_optic ] ) . here , we used @xmath32 magnitudes from the first epoch .",
    "we selected the stars that lie within the determined cluster radius and one can see on the diagram that the cluster members mainly represent the lower part ms population .",
    "more massive stars have already evolved from the ms and the to - point is well visible at @xmath33 mag .",
    "some rgb stars are also present . for comparison , we plotted isochrones of parsec v1.1 @xcite , which are reddened with the proper extinction ( see fig .",
    "[ cmd_optic ] ) to match the observed ms , to - point , rgb and the clump .",
    "the used parameters are in consistence with the previously obtained ones .",
    "the two candidate variables ( empty circles in the latter figure ) lie in the middle and in the upper part of the ms but their luminosities are not high enough to suspect them neither as @xmath34 scuti nor as even dimmer @xmath35 doradus pulsating variables . according to the best fitting isochrones the masses of both stars are close to 1 solar mass and the detected amplitude variations about 2 tenths of magnitude within a time span of a month may be related to stellar eclipses by a companion star  a likely possibility , taking into account their position on the cmd .",
    "another option is a rotational modulation by sun - like spots  the variation study @xcite among a sample of sun - like stars reveals at least one object - hd 129333  with similar amplitude .",
    "however , due to the sparsity of the available data any further clarification of the nature of the variability of these stars is not possible .",
    "in an attempt to strengthen our knowledge of whiting1 we used nir photometry and determined the physical parameters of whiting1 .",
    "we fitted isochrones to @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 color - magnitude diagram and derived an age t=5.7@xmath00.3gyr , metallicity @xmath1=0.006@xmath00.001 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath20.5@xmath00.1 ) and distance modulus @xmath3=17.48@xmath00.10 .",
    "our results confirm that whiting 1 is a young and moderately metal - rich globular cluster .",
    "it is one of the youngest from the sgr dsph .    in the nir cmd",
    ", we noticed a clustering of objects at @xmath36 , @xmath37 with radius r@xmath91.5@xmath10 , presumably a background galaxy cluster .",
    "we estimated a redshift and z@xmath91 is based on a comparison with the colors of galev evolutionary synthesis models @xcite for e / sa galaxies .",
    "our multi - epoch @xmath6 band monitoring led up to the discovery of two candidate variable stars within the cluster radius .",
    "their differential light curves give maximum peak - to - peak variation of @xmath90.2 mag for both candidates over the monitoring period of 35 days and taking in to account their position on the cmd diagram the stars are likely to be eclipsing binaries .",
    "authors would like to thank venelin kozhuharov for his valuable help on fitting analysis and the anonymous referee for his / her constructive comments and suggestions that helped us to greatly improve to the paper .",
    "the data used in the publication were retrieved from the eso science archive .",
    "they were obtained under program ids : 59.a-9002(a ) , 59.a-9908(a ) , and 60.a-9013(a ) .",
