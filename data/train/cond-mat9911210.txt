    "in this paper , we continue the investigation proposed in @xcite and started in @xcite , on the influence of realistic interactions on the expression for the free energy of the interacting bose system .",
    "the method we propose is distinct from other treatments in two main aspects .",
    "firstly , it allows for the treatment of finite - range interatomic potentials whereas nearly all theoretical studies relying on a mean - field description have focused on a two - body contact potential .",
    "secondly , the exact quantum statistics , both of the condensate and of the non - condensate atoms , is treated analytically at arbitrary temperature .",
    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in systems of trapped , interacting bosonic atoms @xcite has led to renewed theoretical efforts @xcite to understand the properties of bose gases .",
    "the need to go beyond the contact potential ( also discussed in @xcite ) appears because the ground state energy of a contact potential with negative scattering length ( relevant for the @xmath1li ) is not bounded from below .",
    "the present study of finite - range potentials , based on a variational principle resulting from the jensen - feynman inequality , avoids this artefact .",
    "this variational principle ( originally formulated by feynman @xcite to treat the problem of an electron in a polarizable medium ) is extended in section ii  to treat many - body systems with finite - range interactions , thereby incorporating the quantum statistics of the particles analytically . to investigate interaction potentials different from the contact potential , the t - matrix formulation used in @xcite",
    "can also be applied . in this formulation , the limit of the contact potential is given by the long wavelength limit . in a sense ,",
    "the present method is the ` real space ' complement of the ` momentum space ' t - matrix calculation : the knowledge of the pair correlation function @xmath2  of the model system in the present approach allows to effectively study the effects of the spatial dependence of the interaction potential .",
    "the system which we analyze in the present paper consists of a fixed number of bosonic atoms in a parabolic confinement .",
    "the interatomic interaction studied in detail in this paper is a morse potential where the parameters are determined by the scattering length and the neutral atomic radius .",
    "although in the most recent experiments @xcite mixtures of gases with different spin states are examined , we consider only the spin - polarized bose gas in the present analysis .",
    "the results of the path integral variational method elaborated in section ii , applied to the spin - polarized gas of bosons interacting through a morse potential , are reported in section iii , and the specific case of lithium is investigated using the experimentally derived interatomic potential ( from spectroscopy measurements of abraham _ et al . _",
    "the discussion of the results and a comparison with other methods are presented in section iv .",
    "the essential property of realistic interatomic interactions is that atoms repel at short distances and attract when they are some distance apart . in this section ,",

    "for a repulsive morse potential ( @xmath85 , full line ) we find that the size of the atom cloud is expanded since @xmath86 .",
    "an attractive morse potential ( @xmath87 , discussed below , dashed line in the inset ) on the other hand will contract the gas .      for morse potentials with negative scattering length , @xmath71 has two minima separated by a free energy barrier .",
    "there is again a minimum for @xmath54 of the order of @xmath68 , but a second minimum is found at a much higher frequency near @xmath88 where @xmath7 reflects the range of the attractive part of the interaction and @xmath89 .",
    "this second minimum has a free energy value of the order of @xmath90 where @xmath8 reflects the depth of the attractive part of the interatomic potential .",
    "the average distance between the bosons is of the order of @xmath91 and is thus comparable to the range of the interatomic potential .",

    ". we will refer to this state as the ` clustered ' state , and to the state corresponding to the minimum with @xmath92of the order of @xmath68 as the ` gaseous ' state .",
    "since the free energy in the clustered state is lower than the free energy in the gaseous state , the latter is metastable with respect to a transition to the clustered state . when the scattering length is not negative , the minimum in the free energy at a large ( ` cluster ' ) value of @xmath54  is not present .",
    "this property of the free energy has been checked numerically for a morse potential and has been obtained analytically for any two - step square well potential with a non - negative scattering length .    for the negative scattering lengths ,",
    "only the specific heat associated with the gaseous state shows a peak as a function of temperature , and thus we find a condensation temperature only in the gaseous state , as expected .",
    "the interaction induced shift in the condensation temperature is opposite to the shift for potentials with positive scattering length , as shown in figure 2 .      as discussed above for the morse potentials with negative scattering length ,",
    "there are in general two minima in the free energy .",
    "however , when the number of particles is increased at fixed temperature , we find that the minimum in the variational free energy associated with the gaseous state disappears above a critical number @xmath93 of particles .",

    "this theoretical value for @xmath93 in the limiting case of @xmath106 was also obtained by salasnic @xcite using a gaussian variational wave function and the rayleigh - ritz variational principle .",
    "the advantage of the present method , however , is that unlike a variational approach based on a trial wave function , the current technique allows to calculate @xmath93 at any temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the critical number @xmath107 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "figure 3 represents a phase diagram in the @xmath108 plane for the case of negative scattering length @xmath109 , a value typical for the experiments on ultra cold trapped atoms ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "this specific choice for @xmath110 corresponds to @xmath111 at zero temperature .",
    "several regions can be distinguished in this phase diagram : a region where the metastable gaseous state exists and is not bose condensed@xmath112 a region where the metastable gaseous state exists as bose condensate , and finally a region where only the clustered state was found by the present approach .",

    "note that the decrease in the condensate fraction is much less pronounced in the case of houbiers et al .",

    "the agreement between the clustered state for the morse potential and for the experimental potential is good , and increases in accuracy as the number of particles increases .",
    "also the critical number @xmath93 remains the same .",
    "the result for the critical number of particles for the experimental setup of @xcite , with scattering length and trapping parameters such that @xmath143 , is @xmath144 in the present approach .",
    "this number @xmath93  represents the maximum number of atoms in the trap that still can undergo bose - einstein condensation .",
    "thus it is an upper bound to the average number of atoms which is reported in @xcite to lie between @xmath145 .",
    "the method proposed in this paper allows to incorporate any two - body interaction @xmath36 in the description of the thermodynamics of an interacting bose gas . from this point of view , its application is more general than the gross - pitaevskii model which takes into account a two - body contact potential @xmath146 with scattering length @xmath11 , and which hence neglects the range and shape of the interatomic potential . from the expression of the expectation value of the two - body interaction in the jensen - feynman inequality ,",
    "it is clear that this approximation will be valid as long as the range of the interatomic potential ( of the order of @xmath7  for the morse potential used above ) is much shorter than the typical length scale @xmath147 over which the pair correlation function varies .",
    "indeed , in that case , the expectation value of the interatomic potential essentially depends on the value of the pair correlation function in the origin and on the scattering length : @xmath148 however , even for short - range interactions , the typical length scale of the pair correlation function can become comparable to the range of the interatomic interactions .",
    "this happens for interatomic potentials which allow for a clustered state ( a bound state involving many particles ) . in that case , the details of the interaction potential become important and models based on the gross - pitaevskii equation using a contact potential lead to an unphysical result : the free energy in these models is not bound from below .",
    "this artefact is avoided in the present treatment by taking into account the range of the interatomic potential .",
    "bose - einstein condensation in a gas with negative scattering length has been achieved experimentally : for a parabolically confined gas of lithium atoms a bose - einstein condensate of at most @xmath145 bosons @xcite was observed , comparable to the critical number for this experiment , predicted from the theory presented here .",
    "it should be noted that the present analysis does not describe the dynamics of a cooling bose gas nor does it describe the dynamics of the formation of the clustered state .",
    "the critical number of bosons beyond which bose - einstein condensation is no longer possible may be different in the experiment due to the dynamical effects .    in the theoretical approach presented here , as well as in the two - fluid models",
    "@xcite for the condensate and even in the monte carlo simulations @xcite , it is tacitly assumed that the system is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is also clear that the measurements are done on systems that are not in equilibrium at all ; even obtaining a steady state seems at present out of the experimental reach @xcite .",
    "this means that in discussing the theoretical results we rely on our intuition of how the calculated equilibrium situation is reached without conflicting with the known experimental facts for the non - equilibrium situation . for our approach , this means that we have to argue how it is possible that a metastable state with a much higher energy than the ground state can be studied experimentally , while the ground state itself does not even show up circumstantially . for distinguishable particles",
    "it is generally accepted that the life - time of a metastable state is proportional to the energy - barrier between the two states and inversely proportional to their energy difference .",
    "there are different scenarios possible .",
    "the first one implicates gravity : as soon as a cluster of a few atoms is formed it leaves the trap due to the gravitational force , thereby reducing the number of atoms available for condensation and increasing the average energy present in the trap , because the low - energy states can escape now . in this scenario one is allowed to start with a number of atoms larger than the calculated @xmath93 .",
    "after some time of operation , clustering will reduce the number of atoms in the trap .",
    "once the number of atoms is lower , the metastable state becomes available as the first excited state of the system .",
    "if the collision rate in this state does not differ fundamentally from the collision rate of the previous situation , the clustering will go on , and eventually all particles will have left the trap . if there is a change in collision rate , or if the state is almost collision free , the metastable state can get the necessary life - time to be available for experimentation . for @xmath149rb",
    "this change in collision - rate was found @xcite to be due to the influence of the condensate on the loss - rate of three - body recombinations .",
    "this characteristic was predicted by kagan _",
    "@xcite who suggests also to use it as the signature of the presence of the condensate .",
    "the physical origin of the change in collision rate is due to a change in distribution . while in the high temperature phase the distribution is gaussian ( at least to a good approximation ) it would remain gaussian ( with different parameters ) if the particles were distinguishable .",
    "projecting it on the symmetric irreducible representation of the permutation group as required for indistinguishable particles , the distribution takes the equilibrium of the condensate and its excitations into account .    in this paper",
    ", we presented a path - integral variational method which 1 ) exactly treats the quantum statistics at any temperature and 2 ) allows to incorporate finite range two - body interactions in the description of the thermodynamics of the bose gas . after presenting this technique",
    ", we focused on a gas of parabolically trapped bosonic atoms interacting though a morse potential .",
    "the effect of this interaction on the condensation temperature was studied . for morse potentials with a negative scattering length , a phase diagram was derived showing the influence of the interaction on the region in @xmath108 parameter space favorable to bose - einstein condensation . apart from the interaction induced shift in condensation temperature , the region in @xmath150 parameter space available for bose - einstein condensation",
    "is reduced by the presence of a clustered phase .",
    "the effect of the interaction and the bose statistics on the critical number of particles above which the gaseous state was no longer found in the present treatment , was calculated .",
    "we identified a temperature above which  bose - einstein condensation is no longer possible regardless of the number of particles .",
