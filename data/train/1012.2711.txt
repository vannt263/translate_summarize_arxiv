    "we do not consider the two ion escape processes which is possible for @xmath50 because in this high - energy regime the immediate escape of both ions dominates and no new time scales or processes emerge . in order to avoid artificial transient effects we have to ensure that the initial conditions are distributed uniformly over the energy shell . to this end",
    ", we briefly describe in the following the preparation of the initial ensemble .",
    "first , the positions of the ions @xmath51 are distributed randomly in the interior of the well , which we define to be @xmath52 . due to",

    "generally , with increasing initial energy the region in phase space allowing for escape grows and the particles leave the well more quickly .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows the escape times on a logarithmic scale for initial conditions on the energy shell @xmath47 which lie additionally in the plane @xmath35 formed by the pss .",
    "the border of the grey area defines the border of the energy shell . a comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) shows that the longest escape times belong to initial conditions close to the stable manifold of the period one orbit @xmath59 .",
    "this orbit is marginally unstable because it originates from @xmath40 which is one of the dominant stable periodic orbits .",
    "consequently , the particles starting in the vicinity of the stable manifold of @xmath59 approach the fixed point , stay in its vicinity for a long time and escape afterward via the unstable manifold leading to infinity . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( a ) shows the probability density of the kinetic energy of the escaping ion @xmath60 for initial energy @xmath29 , where @xmath61 is recorded at the border of the well @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath60 possesses a sharp peak at the maximal value for the kinetic energy , which is determined by energy conservation .",
    "obviously , the coulomb term as well as the potential energy of the escaped ion is zero .",
    "furthermore , the minimum energy of the residual ion is @xmath63 .",
    "thus the maximum kinetic energy of the escaped ion is @xmath64 which amounts in our case to @xmath65 . since there is still a remaining coulomb contribution ( the detector is at a finite distance from the trap ) for the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( a ) , the maximum kinetic energy @xmath66 is smaller , i.e. @xmath60 has a sharp cut - off at @xmath67 and not at @xmath68 .",
    "the general appearance of @xmath60 , namely an increase followed by a plateau - like behaviour , can be understood intuitively . for @xmath29",
    "the phase space contains a regular island of bounded dynamics in the potential well ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ( d ) ) .",
    "consequently , the ions starting in this integrable structure do not contribute to the escape .",
    "due to the fact that these initial conditions correspond to small kinetic energies , the distribution @xmath60 decreases for @xmath69 .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( b ) shows the distribution of escape times @xmath70 which has a dominant peak followed by a steep drop . with decreasing initial energy the tail of the distribution",
    "becomes more pronounced until a collapse occurs for @xmath28 and no escape of ions is possible anymore .",
    "the peak of @xmath70 corresponds to the immediate emission process .",
    "a further analysis of the correlation between the kinetic energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( a ) ) and the escape time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( b ) ) reveals that the peaks in @xmath60 belong to initial conditions with particularly long escape times and thus to particles starting in the vicinity of the stable manifolds of marginally unstable fixed points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and the corresponding discussion of the marginally unstable periodic orbits ) .",
    "the width of these peaks of @xmath71 corresponds to the volume in phase space which gets transported along the unstable manifold out of the trap .",
    "the structure of these manifolds becomes more complicated with decreasing energy leading to a sequence of peaks in @xmath60 .",
    "finally , the channel of the energy shell towards infinity becomes thinner .",
    "accordingly , the distribution of kinetic energies develops into a delta distribution located at @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "in this central section of our work the dynamics following a ramp of the well with many ions is explored .",
    "a ramp means that the depth of the well is reduced instantaneously . due to the fact that the number of degrees of freedom increases according to the number of particles , the energy shells of the static system for many ions are topologically complicated objects of high dimensionality .",
    "hence a uniform distribution of initial conditions on an energy shell is not only difficult to achieve but in particular also not a natural starting point for an experimental setup .",
    "instead we use as initial conditions an ensemble which is sampled in position space randomly in small intervals @xmath74 around the coulomb crystal configuration with all initial momenta set to zero . for the interval widths",
    "@xmath74 we choose , as a typical value , the twentieth part of the mean crystal distance . instead of the uniform distribution on a given energy shell",
    "this is indeed a more realistic scheme with respect to an experimental preparation of such a setup . for the charge of the ions @xmath4 and the depth @xmath13",
    "we choose @xmath30 and @xmath75 such that the coulomb crystal exists for up to ten ions in the well . in a second step",
    "the well is ramped up by @xmath76 and the resulting dynamics is observed and analyzed .",
    "[ [ three - ions ] ] three ions + + + + + + + + + +    for @xmath77 the ions oscillate with comparatively small amplitudes and no significant energy transfer among them occurs .",
    "however , for a further reduction of the well s depth @xmath13 the coulomb interaction gains importance such that the dynamics becomes more and more chaotic : for a larger @xmath76 the ions oscillate with larger amplitudes and thus the relative distance between them can become small .",
    "therefore , the probability increases that in the course of the dynamics after the ramp an ion gains enough kinetic energy to be emitted . still , due to energy conservation",
    "there is an energy threshold for a single ion - escape to become possible .",
    "nevertheless , above this threshold not every initial condition leads to an emission - event . for @xmath78",
    "the escape of a single ion becomes energetically possible .",
    "for this energy which is slightly above the mentioned threshold value the escape process is typically characterized by a phase of motion during which two neighbouring ions move in the same direction .",
    "this leads to a strong enhancement of the kinetic energy of the third outermost ion which gets `` kicked '' out of the potential well . after the escape of one ion the relevance of the coulomb repulsion decreases and the remaining ions start quasi - periodic oscillations around the equilibrium positions of the two - ion coulomb crystal .     probability distribution of escape times @xmath70 of a single ion when",
    "three ions are loaded into the trap and the well is ramped from @xmath75 to @xmath79 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] the distribution of the escape times for a ramp to @xmath80 is presented , which shows asymptotically ( large @xmath81 ) an algebraic decay .",
    "the long tail is due to initial conditions with total energies hardly above the energy threshold .",
    "consequently , for these events the energy exchange process leading to an ion - escape has to be very efficient meaning that two ions must transfer a large fraction of their kinetic energy to the third ion such that the latter can leave the well .",
    "accordingly , a larger @xmath76 of the ramp of the potential does not necessarily yield a higher kinetic energy of an individual escaping ion because the emission occurs also in case a smaller portion of the kinetic energy of two ions is transfered to the third one . by a ramp of the well to even smaller depths @xmath82 the two ion emission process becomes possible .",
    "finally , for @xmath83 all initial conditions yield two ion escape . in this regime",
    "the emission occurs generally in a synchronized manner , i.e. as pairs where the difference between the escape times @xmath84 of the two ions of a pair is small compared to all other time scales ( see below for a more detailed discussion of this process ) .",
    "we remark that by fine - tuning @xmath76 it is also possible to achieve the situation where @xmath85 can become large .",
    "such a two - ion emission occurs if the ramping of the well @xmath76 is tuned to be only slightly above the energy threshold for two - ion emission .",
    "these events are rare and their fraction remains below 0.75 % in the regime @xmath86 .",

    "the single initial condition used for the simulation corresponds to the configuration of the coulomb crystal for @xmath75 . in this case",
    "we observe that eight ions leave the well .",

    "accordingly , we take @xmath88 different initial ensembles of ions , ramp up the trap by @xmath76 and record the kinetic energy as well as the escape time of the emitted ions .",
    "thus all following results are ensemble properties .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] shows the logarithm of the frequency distribution @xmath89 of the kinetic energy and the escape time for a ramp from @xmath75 to @xmath90 . in this case",
    "six ions escape from the trap .",

    "[ fig : fig8 ] corresponds to two emitted ions . in the inset",

    "@xmath91 belonging to the third and fourth ion is almost identical to the corresponding distribution for the first and the second ion .",
    "obviously , @xmath85 is very small compared to the interpair emission time intervals @xmath92 .",
    "additionally , the distribution @xmath91 decreases rapidly , i.e. to a very good approximation the emission process can indeed be regarded as pairwise .",
    "an intuitive physical explanation of this result is given in the following : before the ramp the initial ensembles are spatially close to the highly symmetric coulomb crystal configuration .",
    "due to the instantaneous reduction of the potential depth much potential energy is transfered into the system .",
    "subsequently , these now excited chains relax by the emission of ions .",
    "since the symmetry of the trap is preserved by the ramp , the forces acting on the outermost ions immediately after the instantaneous reduction of the potential have the same absolute value but opposite signs and consequently the ions escape in opposite directions within a small time - interval .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] reveals that @xmath92 increases within a sequence of pairs whereas the kinetic energy decreases .",
    "this behaviour can be explained as follows .",
    "the force which pushes the ions outwards is largest for the first pair and decreases with every subsequently emitted pair .",
    "additionally , every escaping pair is slowed down by the coulomb repulsion of the previously emitted ions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] these two characteristics can be seen as a `` fanning out '' of the trajectories with a decreasing slope .",
    "thus the escape velocity becomes smaller with every emitted pair . by ramping the trap to different potential depths in the regime where the emission of six ions occurs ,",
    "the time difference between the consecutive pairs @xmath92 can be tuned , i.e. @xmath92 decreases with increasing @xmath76 . moreover , since the total energy of the ensemble after the ramp is higher for larger @xmath76 , the kinetic energy of each emitted pair increases as well .",

    "so far we have discussed the situation when the ramp leads to an emission of an even number of ions . yet , it is also possible that after the ramp only an odd number of ions can leave the trap . for these cases",
    "the scenario is the following .",
    "first one observes the emission of a maximal even number of ions in terms of synchronized pairs according to the discussion provided above .",
    "afterwards , a single ion leaves the well .",
    "its escape from the trap can be delayed significantly with respect to the emission of the last pair .",
    "such an event occurs when the ramp is chosen only slightly above the necessary energy threshold and can be explained straightforwardly .",
    "after the emission of the pairs the remaining ions oscillate chaotically in the trap .",
    "accordingly , it can take a very long time until , in the course of the dynamics , the randomly distributed kinetic energy accumulates onto a single ion which can then be emitted .",
    "consequently , the distribution of the kinetic energies of the last single escaping ion is not peaked at a certain value as for the pairwise emission but it shows an exponentially decreasing tail .",

    "for @xmath96 we have @xmath97 .",
    "however on the scale on which the dynamics is observed this behaviour is suppressed by the large power of the denominator and the fact of a small value of the prefactor @xmath98 . due to the parity asymmetry of the potential",

    ", the emission of a pair with @xmath106 occurs at @xmath107 .",
    "this behaviour can be traced back to the shape of the trap .",
    "obviously , due to the asymmetry of the potential the leftmost ion has a lower potential energy .",
    "thus compared to the rightmost ion a larger fraction of its kinetic energy is needed for the emission from the trap after the ramp of the potential depth . since the potential difference due to the asymmetry of the trap decreases towards the origin , the difference of potential energies is less for the next two outer ions .",
    "thus they escape pairwise again .",
    "for a larger ramping @xmath76 one observes also an energetic and temporal separation of the emission for the later escape events , that is for an appropriate choice of @xmath76 the third and fourth ion etc can be separated as well . due to the fact that these results are obtained for a random sampling of the ions initial position in the vicinity of the corresponding coulomb crystal we expect that effects like micromotion do not alter qualitatively the results .",
    "furthermore , this statement is supported by our numerical observation that no significant changes occur when the ions are additionally given a small initial momentum , i.e. the emission properties of the ions from the trap are very robust .",
    "we have studied the nonlinear escape dynamics of long - range coulomb interacting ions from a one - dimensional trap . as a necessary prerequisite",
    "we have first accounted for the few ion setup , its phase space structure , and observed that the phase space of two ions in the static potential well can be regular , mixed or chaotic depending on the energy . for energies larger than a certain threshold",
    "the energy shell extends towards infinity and consequently the escape of ions from the trap is possible .",
    "it has been elucidated that the manifolds of unstable periodic orbits play a crucial role in this emission process .",
    "particles starting in the vicinity of the stable manifold show the longest escape times from the well and contribute to dominant peaks in the distribution of the kinetic energy of the escaping ions .",
    "our main result concerns the escape dynamics of an ensemble of ions initially in a configuration close to the coulomb crystal when the potential depth is decreased by an instantaneous ramp of the trap .",

    "@xmath76 the number of the emitted pairs , the time differences between the consecutive pair emission events and the average kinetic energy of each pair can be varied .",
    "if the ramp is chosen such that an odd number of ions can escape , one observes after a maximal even number of ions escaping pairwise the emission of a single ion .",
    "its escape can be delayed significantly .",
    "moreover , the kinetic energy distribution possesses an exponentially decreasing tail , because the dynamics leading to its escape is chaotic .",

    "<S> we show that an instantaneous reduction of the trap s potential depth leads to the synchronized emission of a sequence of ion pairs if the initial configurations are close to the crystalline ionic configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding time - intervals of the consecutive pair emission as well as the number of emitted pairs can be tuned by changing the final trap depth . </S>",
