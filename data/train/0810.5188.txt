    "since the era of the einstein observatory @xcite , luminous point - like x - ray sources , of which x - ray luminosities exceed a few times @xmath8 ergs s@xmath5 , were frequently found at off - center regions of nearby normal galaxies .",
    "these x - ray sources are called ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of ulxs has remained one of the important unresolved issues in x - ray astrophysics , for nearly three decades .",
    "both observational ( e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretical ( e.g. , @xcite ) studies suggest that the x - ray properties of ulxs resemble those of galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) in high accretion rates . however , we currently have two distinct interpretations of ulxs ; intermediate mass bhbs with a mass of @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the solar mass ) radiating at sub- or trans - eddington luminosities , and stellar - mass bhbs shining at highly super - eddington luminosities .",
    "we urgently need to distinguish the two alternative .",
    "x - ray spectra of well - studied ulxs are approximated by either a multi - color disk ( mcd ; @xcite ) model or a power - law ( pl ) one ( or their combination ) .",
    "furthermore , several ulxs are reported to show a spectral transition between the mcd - like and pl - like states ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these properties could be explained , in the simplest manner , by regarding the mcd - like and pl - like states as analogous to the classical high / soft and low / hard states of galactic bhbs , respectively .",
    "however , this naive interpretation has encountered several difficulties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent observational studies ( e.g , @xcite ) revealed that the x - ray spectra of the mcd - like ulx requires a temperature profile in the accretion disk that is flatter than those in the standard accretion disk @xcite assumed in the mcd model .",
    "the flat temperature profile is theoretically predicted by a concept of slim accretion disk @xcite , in which an optically - thick advection and/or photon trapping ( e.g. , @xcite ) become important due to high accretion rates .",
    "the slim disk interpretation can solve several basic problems with the mcd model , including too - high disk temperatures and variable innermost disk radii @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mcd - like ulx is thought to harbor a slim accretion disk rather than a standard disk . on the other hand , photon indices of the pl - like ulxs ( @xmath11",
    "; e.g. , @xcite ) are steeper than those of the classical low / hard state bhbs ( @xmath12  @xmath13 ; e.g , @xcite ) . because such a steep photon index is observed from galactic bhbs when they are in the very high state ( vhs ; @xcite ) in which comptonization plays an important role @xcite , the pl - like ulxs are thought to be in the vhs @xcite . in the recent suzaku @xcite observation of a nearby normal galaxy ngc 1313 , @xcite have reinforced the vhs and slim disk state interpretations of two ulxs therein , x1 and x2 , respectively .",
    "so far , these typical ulx properties have been observed from objects with very high luminosities ( e.g. , @xmath14 ergs s@xmath5 ) , which require either a high bh mass or an extreme super - eddington condition ( or both ) .",
    "if , however , such ulx properties are confirmed in less luminous objects with a luminosity within a few times the eddington limit of galactic stellar - mass bhbs , we will become sure that the ulx phenomena can appear without highly - supper eddington luminosities .",
    "particularly important is to search for spectral transitions among such objects .",
    "source 3 ( hereafter , src 3 ) in the nearby spiral ( sabcd ) galaxy ngc 2403 is one of the most suitable targets for our purpose .",
    "originally discovered by the einstein observatory @xcite , it was later revealed with asca to exhibit an mcd - type spectrum with an innermost disk temperature of @xmath15 kev and an innermost disk radius of @xmath16 km @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its bolometric luminosity , @xmath17 ergs s@xmath5 , places it in between luminous ulx and ordinary stellar - mass bhbs . in order to examine whether this object exhibits the ulx - like behavior , we conducted a suzaku observation of ngc 2403 ; then the object was again found in the mcd - like state .",
    "we also utilized chandra and xmm - newton archival data of src 3 , and discovered a spectral transition that resembles those observed in more luminous ulxs . in the present paper , these results are utilized to strengthen the classification of src 3 as a ulx with a rather modest luminosity .",
    "we employ the distance to ngc 2403 of @xmath18 mpc @xcite , as determined from observations of cepheid variables .",
    "the suzaku observation of ngc  2403 was conducted on 2006 march 1617 , during the science working group phase . the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) onboard suzaku were operated in the normal clocking mode without any window option , and in the normal mode , respectively .",
    "the nucleus of the ngc 2403 galaxy was placed at the xis nominal position @xcite .    utilizing the headas 6.5.1 software package , we reprocessed the data from the revision 2 processing , and created new cleaned event files .",
    "the present paper concentrates on the xis data , because no significant x - ray signals were detected with the hxd in this observation .",
    "we screened the data under the following criteria ; the spacecraft is outside the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , the time after an exit from the saa is larger than 436 s , the geometric cut - off rigidity is higher than @xmath19 gv , the source elevation above the rim of bright and night earth is higher than and , respectively , and the xis data are free from telemetry saturation . as a result ,",
    "we have obtained @xmath20 ks of good exposure . in the scientific analysis below , we utilize only those events with a grade of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 .",
    "figure [ fig : img_suzaku ] shows a 0.5  10 kev suzaku xis image of ngc 2403 , superposed on an optical image taken from the digitized sky survey ( dss ; @xcite ) .",
    "two bright point - like x - ray sources are clearly seen in the figure ; the brighter and fainter of them correspond to src 3 and source 5 ( hereafter src  5 ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "in addition to the point sources , we clearly observe faint x - ray emission , extending along the optical galaxy .",
    "the detailed properties of this extended ( possibly diffuse ) x - ray emission will be reported in a separate paper @xcite . in the summer of 2004 ,",
    "a supernova , sn2004dj , exploded in this galaxy @xcite .",
    "although x - ray emission from sn2004dj was detected with chandra in 2004 @xcite at a @xmath21  @xmath22 kev flux of @xmath23 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath24 , we found no significant x - ray enhancement at the location of the supernova ( the filled star in figure [ fig : img_suzaku ] ) above a @xmath21  @xmath22 kev flux upper limit of @xmath25 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath24 .",
    "we integrated x - ray signals of src 3 within a circle denoted as * src3 * in figure [ fig : img_suzaku ] .",
    "the background spectrum was derived within a circle * bgd3*. in order to reduce possible contributions from the extended x - ray emission , we adopted a radius of ( corresponding to @xmath26 kpc at the distance of @xmath27 mpc ) for these regions , which is slightly smaller than a typical integration region used in the suzaku analysis of point sources ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_src3_suzaku ] shows background - subtracted two - band x - ray lightcurves of src 3 , obtained with the three front - illuminated ( fi ) ccd cameras ( xis 0 , 2 and 3 ; @xcite ) of the xis . summed over the three fi ccds ,",
    "the time - averaged count rate of src 3  is measured to be @xmath29 cts s@xmath5 and @xmath30 cts s@xmath5 in the soft ( @xmath21  @xmath31 kev ) and hard ( @xmath31  @xmath32 kev ) bands , respectively .",
    "the data suggest a variation on a time - scale of @xmath33 ks in the middle of the observation , it is statistically insignificant ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the soft and hard band , respectively ) . as a result ,",
    "the hardness is found to be rather constant throughout the exposure .",
    "below , we hence analyze the time - averaged spectrum of src 3 .",
    "figure [ fig : src3_suzaku ] shows background - subtracted xis spectra of ngc 2403 src 3 , presented without removing the instrumental response .",
    "the x - ray spectra obtained with fi and background - illuminated ( bi ) ccd camera ( xis 1 ; @xcite ) were both binned into energy intervals each with at least 100 events .",
    "thus , the x - ray signals were significantly detected over the 0.410 kev range .",
    "the spectrum appears to be rather featureless , without any clear sign of emission or absorption features .    to analyze the spectra , we calculated a response matrix function ( rmf ) and an auxiliary response file ( arf ) , using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen @xcite , respectively .",
    "the reduction of the effective area due to contaminants on the optical blocking filters of the xis was taken into account by xissimarfgen .",
    "we performed the spectral fitting using xspec version 12.4.0 .",
    "we fitted the src 3 spectra with the mcd and pl models , as a standard way in analyzing the spectra of galactic bhbs and ulxs .",
    "the fi and bi spectra were jointly fitted , with the model normalization allowed to differ between them .",
    "we found that the fluxes from bi and fi spectra agreed with each other , within 4% .    conducting the spectral fitting",
    ", we found the absorption column density , which was left free , to fall below the galactic line - of - sight value of @xmath36 @xmath24 toward ngc 2403 @xcite .",
    "this effect may be ascribed to residual soft diffuse emission within the src 3 region , which remains even after subtracting signals from the bgd3 region , due to brightness gradients . according to @xcite ,",
    "the diffuse emission in ngc 2403 can be described by thermal plasma emission model with two temperatures of @xmath37 kev and @xmath38 kev , having a metalicity of @xmath39 solar .",
    "we hence took into account the contamination , by adding two apec components in xspec with the temperature fixed at @xmath40 kev and @xmath41 kev , both of which were subjected to the galactic absorption .",
    "their relative normalization was fixed at the value determined with the total diffuse emission ( @xcite ) , while their summed luminosity was left free .",
    "we left free the absorption to the ulx component .",
    "the spectral parameters obtained in this analysis are summarised in table [ table : src3_suzaku ] .",
    "the pl model was rejected with @xmath42 , because the observed x - ray spectrum has a more convex shape , as revealed by residuals in figure [ fig : src3_suzaku ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the mcd model successfully described the x - ray spectrum of src 3 with @xmath43 . the derived absorption column density for the ulx component , @xmath44 @xmath24 , is higher by a factor of about 3 than the galactic value , but this amount of excess absorption is attributed reasonably to that within the ngc 2403 galaxy , and/or an additional absorber localized around the source .",
    "the thermal plasma components were found to have only a negligible contribution to the observed spectrum , with a @xmath21  @xmath32 kev luminosity of @xmath45 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "this luminosity is reasonable in view of the results by @xcite .",
    "the innermost disk temperature of src 3 was obtained as @xmath0 kev .",
    "the x - ray flux was measured to be @xmath46 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath5 in the 0.7  7 kev range , without correcting for absorption .",
    "these give an absorption - corrected bolometric luminosity of @xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 , with @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the inclination of the accretion disk to our line of sight .",
    "the value of @xmath47 agrees with that obtained with asca in 1997 @xcite within statistical errors , while @xmath48 is lower by about @xmath49% . through a relation @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the stefan - boltzmann constant ,",
    "the apparent innermost disk radius is calculated as @xmath52 km .",
    "the true innermost radius is determined as @xmath1 km , applying the correction as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a correction factor for the inner boundary condition @xcite , and @xmath55 is a spectral hardening factor @xcite which represents the ratio of the color temperature to the effective temperature .",
    "we also examined the `` variable-@xmath56 '' disk model , in which the dependence of the local temperature on the radius @xmath57 from the bh is assumed to scale as @xmath58 , with the index @xmath56 being a positive free parameter @xcite . while this model with @xmath59 reduces to a simple mcd model , that with smaller value of @xmath56 , down to 0.5 , is considered to approximate the x - ray spectra from a slim disk @xcite .",
    "the fit was acceptable , but with no significant improvement ( @xmath60 ) over the mcd fit .",
    "all the parameters became consistent with those of the mcd model ; @xmath61 , @xmath62 kev , and @xmath63 km .",
    "in order to better understand the nature of src 3 , its intensity - correlated spectral variations are considered to be of particular importance ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we analyzed the archival chandra  and xmm - newton  data of ngc 2403 .",
    "so far , 5 chandra acis exposures toward ngc 2403 have been conducted , 4 of which were motivated by the discovery of sn2004dj @xcite",
    ". however , ngc 2403 src 3 was within the acis field of view on only three occasions . furthermore , in the first observation performed on 2001 april 17 ( obsid = 2014 ) , the acis spectrum of ngc 2403 src 3 was severely distorted by event pileup ( @xmath64 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we analyzed only the data in the remaining two observations ( obsid = 4628 and 4630 ) , wherein src 3 was placed at a relatively large distance from the acis aimpoint ( see @xmath65 in table [ table : chandra ] ) , so that a broadened point spread function made the event pileup insignificant .",
    "the log of these two observations is shown in table [ table : chandra ] .",
    "the data were read out in the timed - exposure mode with the standard frame time of @xmath27 s , and telemetered in the faint format . in obsid",
    "= 4628 and 4630 , src 3 was placed on acis - s3 ( a bi chip ) and s2 ( an fi one ) , respectively .    utilizing the ciao 3.4 software and referring to caldb 3.3.0.1",
    ", we reprocessed all the data to create new level-2 event files in the standard manner .",
    "we removed acis_detect_afterglow correction , and applied a `` new '' bad pixel file created by acis_run_hotpix . after removing x - ray point sources detected by wavdetect within the acis field of view",
    ", we produced a 0.3 - 12 kev lightcurve covering the entire ccd chip , and then discarded those time intervals where the count rate exceeds 120% of that averaged during the observation .",
    "this procedure gave us the good exposures as listed in table [ table : chandra ] .",
    "the acis spectra of ngc 2403 src 3 were extracted within a circle centered on the x - ray peak , and those of bgd from a concentric annulus .",
    "the radii of these regions are also shown in table [ table : chandra ] .",
    "the rmf and arf files were generated , assuming an x - ray point source , with the ciao tools mkacisrmf and mkarf , respectively .",
    "so far , xmm - newton observations of ngc 2403 have been performed 5 times .",
    "however , only the data obtained in three of them are public at present , of which the observational log is given in table [ table : xmm ] . although the results in the individual observations were separately reported by several authors @xcite , we re - analyzed all the data in a sytematic way .",
    "the third observation ( obsid = 0164560901 ) was motivated by the explosion of sn2004dj .",
    "on all these occasions , the epic mos and pn cameras were operated in the nominal full frame mode .",
    "the medium optical - blocking filter was adopted in the first and second observations ( obsid = 0150651101 and 0150651201 , respectively ) , while the thick one was utilized in the third observation . in the first and second observations",
    ", we do not use the pn data , because src 3 fell on the gap of the pn chips .",
    "we used the science analysis system ( sas ) version 7.0.0 to reduce the xmm - newton data .",
    "all data were reprocessed by emchain or epchain , based on the current calibration files ( ccf ) , which was latest at the beginning of our analysis ( 2007 july ) .",
    "after @xcite , we rejected high - background periods , using the point - source removed lightcurve with pattern = = 0 and # xmmea_em / p in 10  15 kev . as a result , we obtained good exposures , as shown in table [ table : xmm ] .",
    "for the spectral analysis , mos events with pattern @xmath66 , # xmmea_em and flag = 0 , and pn ones with pattern @xmath67 , # xmmea_ep and flag = 0 , were finally selected .",
    "we integrated the epic spectra of ngc 2403 src 3 and bgd , within a circle of @xmath68 radius and an annulus of @xmath69@xmath70 radius , respectively , both centered on src 3 . because the pn image of the third observation revealed a faint point - like source within the bgd annulus , a circle of @xmath71 radius around this contaminating source was removed from both mos and pn data .",
    "we created the rmf and arf , utilizing the sas tools , rmfgen and arfgen respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : ufspec ] compares the chandra and xmm - newton spectra of ngc 2403 src 3 with the suzaku one , in the form of the unfolded spectrum ( panel a ) and of the ratio to the suzaku best - fit mcd model ( panel b ) .",
    "all the data are presented in 0.7  7 kev , where the energy ranges of all the three instruments overlap . in the chandra ( 4628 ) and xmm - newton ( 0164560901 ) observations ,",
    "the spectral shape of src 3 thus coincides well with those in the suzaku  observation , indicating that the source was in the mcd - like spectral state on these occasions .",
    "in addition , the spectral normalization is similar , to within @xmath72 , among these three data sets .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray spectrum in the chandra observation of obsid = 4630 exhibits a distinct and less convex shape , which is approximated by a power - law , at least above @xmath73 kev where the effect of interstellar absorption become unimportant . the flux on this occasion is estimated to be lower by about @xmath74 than that in the suzaku  observation . in figure [ fig : ufspec ] ,",
    "the deconvolved spectra have been derived using the absorbed mcd or pl model ( whichever is more successfull ) to be described below .",
    "the raw chandra and xmm - newton spectra of src 3 in the individual observations are shown in figures [ fig : src3_chandra ] and [ fig : src3_newton ] , respectively .",
    "we applied the mcd and pl models to these spectra , in the same way as for the suzaku  data , and obtained the results summarised in table [ table : src3 ] .",
    "we neglected the contamination from the diffuse x - ray emission associated with the host galaxy , because the integration area , we adopted for chandra and xmm - newton data , were more than an order of magnitude smaller than that for suzaku data .",
    "as figure [ fig : ufspec ] suggests , the mcd model better reproduced the observed x - ray spectra in general , except for that from the chandra observation of obsid = 4630 .",
    "when the source was in the mcd - like state , the spectral parameters exhibited only small deviations from the suzaku measurements .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of src 3 was found to vary only about 10% among these observations .",
    "similar mcd parameters were reported by @xcite and @xcite , based on the third xmm - newton observation .",
    "the chandra spectrum of obsid = 4630 , in contrast , was better reproduced by a pl model with a photon index of @xmath6 . the x - ray flux on this occasion",
    ", @xmath75 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath5 in the 0.7  7 kev range , was lowest among the data sets analyzed here .",
    "the absorption column density became larger by a factor of about @xmath31 ",
    "@xmath76 than those in the other observations ; @xmath77 @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , an apparent @xmath78 change was reported from a transient ulx , cxou j132518.2 - 430304 , which was discovered within the host galaxy of centaurus a @xcite",
    ". however , such significant changes in @xmath78 , associated with transitions between the pl - like and mcd - like states , are uncommon among galactic bhbs .",
    "therefore , this @xmath78 change from src 3 is likely to be an artifact , caused presumably because a simple pl model is inappropriate to describe the softest end of the chandra spectrum from obsid=4630 .",
    "we discuss this issue briefly in section 5 .",
    "although the mcd model gave a better fit than the pl model to all the xmm - newton data , the third xmm - newton dataset still exhibit some residuals with @xmath79 ( figure 6c ) .",
    "this urged us to apply the variable-@xmath56 disk model to this dataset and the other mcd - like ones , as we did for the suzaku spectrum .",
    "then , all the spectra in the mcd - like states were successfully reproduced by the variable-@xmath56 disk model .",
    "the fit was significantly improved in the third xmm - newton observation and the chandra obsid @xmath80 4628 , and yielded @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "in the suzaku observation of ngc 2403 performed on 2006 march 16  17 , src 3 exhibited a curved 0.4  10 kev spectrum , which can be reproduced by the mcd model .",
    "we obtained the innermost disk temperature and radius of the source as @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 km , respectively .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the source was measured as @xmath83 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "making use of the archival chandra and xmm - newton data , we found the source to exhibit similar mcd - type spectrum on 4 occasions , while a pl - shaped spectrum on one occasion ( chandra observation of obsid = 4630 ) when the 0.7  7 kev flux was about @xmath84% and @xmath85% lower than those in the suzaku observation and the chandra observation of obsid = 4628 , respectively .",
    "this flux change between the mcd - like and pl - like states are larger than the relative flux uncertainties between suzaku , chandra , and xmm - newton ( @xmath86% ; e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the mcd - like states ,",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath48 of src 3 exhibited only small variations across more than 8 years from the asca observation @xcite to the suzaku one .",
    "both of these parameters are located at the lowest end of those of typical ulxs .",
    "the value of @xmath88 derived in these observations corresponds to the radius of the last stable orbit , @xmath89 ( @xmath90 being the schwarzschild radius ) , around a non - rotating bh with a mass of @xmath91 .",
    "because the eddington luminosity of such a bh becomes @xmath92 ergs s@xmath5 , the properties of src 3 in the mcd - like states can be understood consitently as a @xmath93 bh radiating at close to @xmath94 , wherein a standard accretion disk is formed down to @xmath95 , like in the high / soft state of normal galactic bhbs .",
    "this apparently reconfirms the conclusion by @xcite .",
    "then , can we really explain the overall behavior of src 3 , by assuming that it was in the standard high / soft state during the suzaku observation ?",
    "one difficulty with the high / soft state interpretation comes from the fact that the third xmm - newton dataset preferred a variable-@xmath56 disk model with @xmath81 , which is smaller than that in the standard accretion disk . to see this in a systematic manner , we plotted in figure [ fig : variable - p ] , the parameters determined from the variable-@xmath56 disk model , against the observed x - ray flux in the @xmath96 ",
    "@xmath97 kev range .",
    "although errors are rather large , the plot reveals a tendency that @xmath88 and @xmath56 become smaller , and @xmath47 gets higher , as the flux increases .",
    "such behavior is numerically predicted by the slim disk model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation is not affected significantly by possible flux uncertainties among the three sattelites , because the three xmm - newton data points reveal the same behavior .",
    "therefore , it is natural to regard that the source was actually in the slim disk state during these observations .",
    "moerover , figure [ fig : variable - p ] indicates that src 3 was in the transition regime between the standard high / soft state ( @xmath59 ) and the slim disk regime ( @xmath98 ) when observed with suzaku .",
    "another difficulty with the high / soft interpretation is provided by the spectral transition , revealed by the chandra data ( obsid = 4630 ) , when the source was @xmath99% less luminous than in the suzaku data . the spectral slope of this pl - like state , @xmath100 , is too steep for the source to be interpreted as in the low / hard state ( @xmath12  @xmath13 ; e.g , @xcite ) , which would be realized when the source becomes less luminous than in the high / soft state . in contrast",
    ", this steep slope agrees very well with those of galactic bhbs in the vhs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , galactic bhbs have been observed to become less luminous when they make a transition from the slim disk state to the vhs .",
    "these comparisons suggest that the pl - like state of src 3 corresponds to the vhs .",
    "since comptonization of disk photons by hot coronae is thought to become important in the vhs @xcite , we tried a comptonization model , * comptt * in xspec @xcite , on the chandra spectrum of src 3 in obsid = 4630 .",
    "the electron temperature of the comptonizing coronae was fixed at @xmath101 kev , as seen in the vhs of xte j1550 - 564 @xcite .",
    "the model successfully described the data with parameters shown in table [ table : compton_4630 ] , giving a fit goodness similar to that with the pl model .",
    "the optical depth of the corona , @xmath102 , is comparable to those of the galactic bhb in the vhs ( @xmath103 ; e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath78 has become consistent with those found in the mcd - like states ; this is because the comptonized continuum flattens in energies below that of the seed photons ( @xmath104 kev ) .",
    "although the derived value of @xmath105 is lower than the disk temperature @xmath106 kev measured in the mcd - like state , the discrepancy could be due to a disk truncation at a radius larger than that of the last stable orbit , as is suggested in the `` strong '' vhs of xte j1550 - 564 @xcite .    from these considerations ,",
    "we conclude that ngc 2403 src 3 normally resides at the lowest end of the slim disk state and makes occasional transitions into the vhs .",
    "since the dominance of these two spectral states is regarded as an essential property of the ulxs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we may regarded src 3 as a ulx , in spite of its moderate luminosity .",
    "in addition , we may regard src 3 as radiating at @xmath107 , for the following two reasons .",
    "one is that the transisions of bhbs between the vhs and the slim disk state is obvseved at @xmath108 , while the other is that the value of @xmath109 would not be observed if the source were radiating with @xmath110 , thus , @xmath48 of the source gives the bh mass as @xmath111  @xmath112 .",
    "we may independently estimate the bh mass using @xmath88 determined by the variable-@xmath56 disk model . in this case , the simple assumption of @xmath113 would underestimate a mass of the bh that hosts a slim disk , because the x - ray photons would also be radiated from the region inside the last stable orbit @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite evaluated a factor to correct the underestimation as @xmath114 ",
    "@xmath115 , by analyzing numerically simulated x - ray spectra from the slim disk with the variable-@xmath56 disk model ( the extended disk black body model in their paper ) for a wide range of mass accretion rate . combining this correction factor and",
    "@xmath88 derived from our variable-@xmath56 disk model fit ( figure [ fig : variable - p]b ) , we estimate the bh mass of ngc 2403 src 3 as @xmath116  @xmath117 .",
    "this value agrees very well with that derived from the eddington limit argument .",
    "therefore , we can consistently interpret the available data of ngc 2403 src 3 , by considerig that it hosts a bh with a mass of @xmath118  @xmath117 , radiating at @xmath107 .",
    "finally , let us discuss implications of the present results on the ulx phenomenon in general . obviously",
    ", they do not give direct support to the intermediate mass bh interpretation of ulx , since the observed luminosity of src 3 is well within the eddington limits of ordinary - mass stellar bh .",
    "nevertheless , one important discovery is that this relatively low - luminosity object exhibits clear ulx behavior , including in particular a transition between the slim disk state and the vhs . in other words , the ulx phenomenon appears even at a luminosity range of @xmath119 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "this is within @xmath120 times the eddington luminosity of any stellar - mass bhs , even if we consider the least massive known bhbs as gro j0422@xmath12132 ( @xmath122 ; @xcite ) , gro j1655@xmath12340 ( @xmath124@xmath125 ; @xcite ) , and gx 339 - 4 ( @xmath126 ; @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the ulx behaviour in this case does not require any highly ( @xmath127 ) super - eddington luminosity .",
    "extrapolating this conclusion to more luminous ulxs , we suggest that they are not radiating at highly super - eddington luminosities , either , even though their mass accretion rates are very likely to be `` super - critical '' .",
    "that is , ulxs are thought to be bhs which are significantly more massive than galactic bhbs , accreting matter at super - critical rates , and yet radiating at about their eddington limit .",

    "ohsuga for his valuable theoretical comments .",
