    "combined with the jeans equation , and by specifying some functional form for the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 , we numerically solved the two equations .",
    "we demonstrated that the velocity anisotropy parameter plays an important role in attaining a density profile that is finite in mass , energy and spatial extent .",
    "if combined again with some empirical density profile from simulations , our theoretical predictions of the anisotropy parameter , and the radial pseudo - phase - space density @xmath1 in the outer regions of the dark matter halo , agree very well with the data of @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "the predictions are also acceptable in the middle regions of dark halos .",
    "disagreements occur in the inner regions , probably because some important physics has been ignored .",
    "the second - order variational calculus reveals the seemingly paradoxical , but actually complementary , consequence that the equilibrium state of self - gravitating systems is not only the global minimum entropy state for the whole system  under the condition of energy conservation and the assumption that @xmath3 is an unknown variable function , whereas the two second - order velocity moments @xmath4 and @xmath5 are known invariant functions of the radius @xmath6  but also , simultaneously , the local maximum entropy state for every and any small part of the system .",
    "this finding suggests that equilibrated self - gravitating systems are not in the maximum entropy states , and the local statistical properties of self - gravitating systems should be different from their global properties .    in a follow - up work @xcite , by introducing an effective pressure instead of a radial pressure to construct the specific entropy , we used the entropy principle .",
    "we proceeded in a similar way as in @xcite and obtained a new entropy stationary equation .",

    "( i ) the entropy forms are only chosen phenomenologically , without robust physical origins . ( 2 ) we calculate the first - order variation only with respect to the density profile , but we treat other variables , such as the pressure , as known functions .",
    "thus , the variational calculus is incomplete .",
    "( 3 ) we could still miss some crucial physics .",
    "nevertheless , from these works , we can still draw the following conclusions .    1",
    ".   both the concept of entropy and entropy principle are still valid for self - gravitating systems .",
    "this finding implies that the entropy - based statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems is also valid , and we do not agree that a dynamical theory can account for the coarse - grained phase - space density ( cf .",
    "entropy is extensive .",
    "we first constructed the specific entropy , and then obtained the total entropy in the additive and hence extensive way , as in equation  ( 4 ) of @xcite or equation  ( 6 ) of @xcite .",
    "the fact that such an extensively defined entropy works very well indicates that a non - extensive entropy , such as the entropy of @xcite , is not necessary .",
    "the equilibrium states also consist of mechanical equilibrium . in @xcite and @xcite , we combined the entropy stationary equation with the jeans equation to predict the final state of the system .",
    "this proved to be a successful approach .",
    "the success of this treatment indicates that the final states are not only statistical equilibrium states , but also mechanical equilibrium states .",
    "local and global equilibria are different .",
    "that is , for an equilibrated self - gravitating system , the local statistical properties differ from the global properties .",
    "this difference suggests that we should develop the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems in a different way from the standard statistical mechanics of short - range interactions .",
    "we use the above four principles to formulate the theoretical framework of the statistical mechanics for spherically symmetric collisionless self - gravitating systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : relaxme ] , we present the series of moment equations , which are derived from the spherical collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) and are employed to characterize the mechanical equilibria of the system . in section  [ sec : ergodic ] , we demonstrate that ergodicity is invalid globally for self - gravitating systems , but that it can be re - established locally if the particles are treated as indistinguishable . in section",
    "[ sec : core ] , we present the entire framework of the statistical mechanics , with a truncated distribution function ( df ) to show how it is possible to work with this statistical mechanics . we give a discussion and conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in physical dynamics , relaxation refers to the essential process by which a system approaches equilibrium or by which a perturbed system returns to equilibrium @xcite .",
    "so far , four collisionless relaxation processes have been identified as being responsible for the equilibrium state of self - gravitating systems : ( i ) violent relaxation , ( ii ) landau damping , ( iii ) phase mixing and ( iv ) chaotic mixing .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of these relaxation processes .",
    "there could also be other possible relaxation mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", @xmath8 is the fine - grained statistical df .",
    "the cbe is an approximation that results from the liouville equation when the particle number of the system is very large , and the @xmath2-body df can be separated as the product of single - particle dfs as @xmath9 here , @xmath10 denotes the phase - space coordinates for the @xmath11-th particle .",
    "this assumption implies that positions of gravitating particles are uncorrelated ( i.e. the probability of finding a particle near any phase - space position is unaffected by the presence or absence of particles at nearby points ; see * ? ? ?",
    "we refer to this separability of the @xmath2-body df as the statistical independence of particle positions .",
    "furthermore , the gravitational effect exerted on a specific particle is collectively represented by the mean gravitational potential @xmath12 , contributed from all the particles of the system .",
    "this mean background potential @xmath12 , as well as the uncorrelation assumption , suggests that the direct gravitational interaction between any two particles is unimportant , and hence should be neglected ( i.e. the particles among themselves are collisionless ) .    the cbe might not be a good approximation in very dense regions , such as the center of a dark matter halo , where two - body relaxation might play an important role . in this case , the cbe would be better replaced by , say , the balescu - lenard equation @xcite .    throughout this work , spherical symmetry",
    "is always assumed for self - gravitating systems .",
    "however , we believe that it is not difficult to extend our results to general cases . we multiply the steady - state cbe with various powers of velocity , and we integrate over all velocities to obtain the moment equations of all orders ( see appendix  [ sec : appdx ] ) . the second - order equation is the familiar jeans equation : @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes either @xmath15 or @xmath16 and the barred quantities indicate the corresponding velocity moments .",

    "[ fig : moments ] we show independent velocity moments up to the 10th - order for spherically symmetric self - gravitating systems .",
    "these non - vanishing moments are the effective thermodynamic variables for self - gravitating systems . obviously , the number of equations of mechanical equilibria ( i.e. the moment equations  [ eq : meq2 ] ) is less than the number of independent moments .",
    "the series of moment equations  ( [ eq : meq2 ] ) does not constitute a closed equation system , because the moments @xmath28 , the one - dimensional transverse moments of all orders ( @xmath29 ) , do not appear in the differential terms , and hence there are no differential equations for them .    the df @xmath26 that satisfies the cbe is the fine - grained df , or phase - space density . any physical quantity constructed with the fine - grained df @xmath26 , such as the entropy @xmath30 ,",

    "also , it is not difficult to prove that the statistical independence suggested by equation  ( [ eq : nbdf ] ) is also held for the coarse - grained df .    with the definition of the coarse - grained df , we can find the relationship between the coarse - grained velocity moment @xmath38 and the fine - grained moment @xmath39 of any quantity @xmath40 , a smooth function of @xmath41 .",
    "we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 within the small phase - space element @xmath44 , and we use the definition of the coarse - grained df of equation  ( [ eq : cgdf1 ] ) . integrating both sides of equation  ( [ eq : qdf1 ] ) over * _ v _ * , we obtain @xmath45 @xmath46 where the last approximation is obtained by taylor expansion with respect to * _ x _ * to the second order .",
    "hence , we can see that , although the coarse - grained df does not obey the cbe , the coarse - grained moments differ from the fine - grained moments by only up to the second - order small quantities determined by the size of the finite volume element .",
    "so , we can safely use these moment equations to characterize the mechanical equilibria of the system , regardless of whether these moments are derived from the fine - grained or coarse - grained df .     vs. the radius @xmath6 of a virialized cold dark matter halo , which is calculated using equation  ( [ eq : rv ] ) .",
    "the simulation data are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the result also implies that the cbe is a very good approximation for describing self - gravitating systems , such as dark matter halos . ]",
    "multiplying both sides of the velocity - moment equations  ( [ eq : meq2 ] ) by @xmath47 and integrating over the radius @xmath6 , we can obtain the generalized virialization relations as @xmath48 @xmath49 in which @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath52 , equation  ( [ eq : exvir ] ) reduces to @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the total kinetic and potential energy contained in the @xmath6-sphere , and @xmath56 is the radial pressure . by differentiating equation  ( [ eq : exvir ] ) with respect to @xmath6 , we can immediately restore the moment equations  ( [ eq : meq2 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the moment equations are equivalent to the generalized virial equations  ( [ eq : exvir ] ) , and hence the mechanical equilibria are identical to the virial equilibria .    from equation  ( [ eq : vir1 ] )",
    ", we define the virialization ratio @xmath57 as a function of @xmath6 as @xmath58 with the density profile @xmath59 , the velocity dispersion profiles @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the simulated dark matter halo ( see * ? ? ?",

    "ergodicity , or equiprobability principle , is the fundamental for equilibrium statistical mechanics . in physics and thermodynamics",
    ", the ergodic hypothesis says that , over long periods of time , the time spent by a particle in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region ( i.e. that all accessible microstates are equiprobable over a long period of time ) .",
    "below , we illustrate that the ergodic hypothesis is not valid for the whole self - gravitating system , but can be re - established in any local finitely small volume element .      in the usual thermodynamic system with short - range interactions , such as an ideal gas , when ergodicity is valid , the constituent particles are driven by irregular forces and perform brownian motions . as a result , the particles can traverse any place of the system , and can attain any possible value of the momentum ( or velocity ) . in this sense ,",
    "the stochastic motion of particles and the complete relaxation of the system are , respectively , the necessary and sufficient condition for the validity of ergodicity . for instance , in an ideal gas , the motion states at some instant @xmath63 of the two particles @xmath64 and @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ergodic](a ) are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . because of the randomness of the motion , at some later time @xmath68 , the microstate of the system is also available by exchanging the motion states between @xmath64 and @xmath65 . if the two microstates before and after the exchanging of the two particles are equiprobable , i.e. @xmath69 = p[a({\\textbf{\\emph q}}_2 , { \\textbf{\\emph p}}_2),b({\\textbf{\\emph q}}_1 , { \\textbf{\\emph p}}_1)]$ ] , then the ergodicity is valid , and vice versa .",
    "however , the above statement of ergodicity is invalid for the whole collisionless self - gravitating system . fig .",
    "[ fig : ergodic](b ) shows the typical regular , or non - resonant , orbit of a gravitating particle moving in an equilibrated spherical gravitational field .",
    "an unclosed curve resembles a rosette in an orbital plane , and eventually passes close to every point in the annulus of an invariant torus , on which the energy and angular momentum of the particle are conserved @xcite . even if the orbit suffers from some small perturbations , according to the kolmogorov - arnold - moser theorem",
    ", the torus corresponding to the regular orbit with fundamental frequencies sufficiently incommensurable will survive the small perturbations .",
    "it retains its topology such that the motion in its vicinity remains regular and confined to the slightly deformed invariant torus @xcite .",
    "hence , such regular motion of the particle is definitely not ergodic motion , in which the particle can not traverse any place of the system , and also can not attain any value of the velocity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "additionally , @xcite indicates that violent relaxation can not wipe out all the information concerning the initial conditions when the system settles down into an equilibrium configuration ( see their fig .",
    "this correlation between the initial and final states also implies that violent relaxation can not give rise to the global ergodicity for the whole system and hence the relaxation is incomplete .",
    "@xcite derived a df of self - gravitating systems , on the basis of the complete relaxation and global validity of ergodicity .",
    "however , the lynden - bell distribution leads to the isothermal mass profile of a gravitating system , with infinite mass , energy and spatial extent .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have already suggested that some kind of incomplete relaxation mechanism should be considered .",
    "for example , the suggested cure by @xcite for incomplete relaxation is to introduce a cut - off in phase - space , so that complete violent relaxation takes place in a limited region only .",
    "shu s approach , however , is to consider additional macroscopic constraints @xcite .",
    "self - gravitating systems are not the only long - range interaction systems in which ergodicity is broken .",
    "@xcite have reported that many ergodicity - breaking events can be found in other long - range systems , such as the generalized hamiltonian mean field model , the ising and the @xmath70 long- plus short - range model ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "so , it seems that the ergodicity breaking could be a common feature of long - range interaction systems .",
    "ergodicity is the basis of equilibrium statistical mechanics for any thermodynamic system .",
    "if ergodicity is completely invalid , then the equilibrium statistical mechanics can not exist .",
    "fortunately , we can re - establish the local ergodicity for equilibrated self - gravitating systems in the following way .",
    "imagine that , at some instant , within a finitely small ( not infinitesimal ) volume element of the system , all the collisionless gravitating particles have deterministic trajectories and labels , and are moving extremely rapidly in randomly oriented straight lines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : indistinguish](a ) . at the next instant , some of the original particles move out of the volume element , but",
    "some others will move into this very element . as time passes ,",
    "this process occurs repeatedly and continuously , so that the particles are constantly superseded .",
    "because these particles are not confined within this volume element , if the observer s field of vision is restricted within this element , these particles can not trackable . in this case",
    ", it is not possible to define the microstates of the local element .",
    "however , if these particles are treated as indistinguishable , even if they have definite trajectories and labels , then the physical picture of the microscopic motions is renewed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : indistinguish](b ) . in this picture , at every instant , these particles , which are losing their trajectories and labels , are randomly and homogeneously populated in the volume element under consideration .",
    "the homogeneous distribution of these indistinguishable particles at an instant exhibits a static distribution pattern , and these different patterns at different instants naturally constitute an ensemble .",
    "when the system is in its equilibrium state , all the background field quantities ( i.e. the velocity moments given by equations  [ eq : vm ] or [ eq : vmts ] ) fluctuate at a magnitude proportional to the inverse of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the particle number of this volume element , with @xmath73 .",
    "so , these moments can be considered as local invariants , which define a confined hypersurface for this volume element .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that every member of the ensemble of the local distribution patterns occurs with equal probability in this hypersurface .",
    "so , in this sense , the microstates of the volume element ( i.e. , the local microstates ) can be defined , and hence the local ergodicity can be re - established .",
    "we provide an intuitive understanding of how to identify the local ergodicity .",
    "if the particles are treated as indistinguishable , if these particles are randomly and homogenously distributed within the finite volume element under consideration and if the velocity distribution is independent of the spatial coordinates , then the local ergodicity can be re - established ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : distxv ] ) .",
    "such a requirement is extremely easy to satisfy , and hence the local ergodicity should always be valid .    in the previous subsection",
    ", we proved the invalidity of global ergodicity by regarding the gravitating particles as distinguishable , with deterministic trajectories and labels . even if the particles are globally treated as indistinguishable , the validity of global ergodicity can not be recovered . according to the ensemble theory ,",
    "the probability distribution of the microstates of a closed system at a fixed energy is derived by assuming that all states on the energy hypersurface in phase space have equal probability . however , as @xcite have argued , the hypersurface of a constant energy for an isolated self - gravitating system is unbounded , and thus the microcanonical probability distribution can not be defined .",
    "this implies that ergodicity , or equiprobability , is broken globally .",
    "the paradox of ensemble inequivalence comes from the following argument ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the canonical ensemble",
    ", the heat capacity at constant volume is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mean value of the energy .",
    "whereas for the self - gravitating system at constant energy ( i.e. in the microcanonical ensemble ) , according to the virial theorem , @xmath76 , so @xmath77 .",
    "because the kinetic energy defines the temperature , as @xmath78 , we obtain the heat capacity of the microcanonical ensemble as @xmath79 with the positive and negative specific heat derived in equations  ( [ eq : cv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cv2 ] ) , respectively , we can see that the microcanonical ensemble and the canonical ensemble are inequivalent for self - gravitating systems .",
    "we propose that such a paradox should originate from the misuse of the ensemble theory .",
    "in fact , a detailed analysis indicates that the ensemble theory is established only upon the validity of global ergodicity , and hence is only applicable for short - range interaction systems . in section",
    "[ sec : gergodic ] , we have demonstrated that the global ergodicity is not valid for self - gravitating systems , so the relationships of equations  ( [ eq : cv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cv2 ] ) , and any other conclusions based on ensemble theories , are rootless for self - gravitating systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as mentioned in section  [ sec",
    ": lergodic ] , @xcite have presented an alternative argument against the existence of the microcanonical ensemble for self - gravitating systems .",
    "they have suggested that the hypersurface of a fixed energy for an isolated self - gravitating system is unbounded , and thus the microcanonical probability distribution can not be defined .",
    "moreover , they have also demonstrated that the canonical ensemble does not exist .",
    "hence , without the validity of ensemble theory , the relationships of equations  ( [ eq : cv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cv2 ] ) should be , at most , considered as two different definitions of the so - called ` heat capacity ' for self - gravitating systems .    in the next section ,",
    "we demonstrate the significance of this local ergodicity in deriving the boltzmann - gibbs entropy for self - gravitating systems .",
    "as addressed in the introduction , in the previous studies @xcite , we found the following .",
    "( i ) both the concept of entropy and the entropy principle are still valid for self - gravitating systems .",
    "( ii ) entropy is additive and hence extensive .",
    "( iii ) the equilibrium states consist of mechanical equilibria .",
    "( iv ) the local statistical properties differ from the global properties .",
    "indeed , we have demonstrated in section  [ sec : gergodic ] that the global ergodicity for self - gravitating systems is broken .",
    "however , if the particles are treated as indistinguishable , then the local ergodicity can still be re - established .",
    "such a characteristic of ergodicity suggests that the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems should be quite different from the standard statistical mechanics of short - range interaction systems .",
    "we first derive the appropriate entropy form for self - gravitating systems , on the basis of the local ergodicity and the statistical independence of particle positions suggested by equation  ( [ eq : nbdf ] ) .",
    "the local ergodicity implies that the indistinguishable gravitating particles should obey fermi - dirac - like statistics ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : macrocell]a ) .",
    "we assume that the center of a finite volume element is located at @xmath80 , whose volume is @xmath81 .",

    "@xcite also included the isotropic jeans equation ( i.e. the last integral term ) as an additional constraint . by extremizing @xmath151 with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath152",
    ", they derived an equation for the mass density of fully relaxed galaxies .",
    "although they did not obtain acceptable results , this approach still provides a correct line of thought , because , as we have mentioned previously , the final relaxed states of self - gravitating systems are not only statistical equilibrium states , but also mechanical equilibrium states .",
    "hence , the mechanical equilibrium equations should also be considered as constraints to the total entropy @xmath153 , and the jeans equation represents the second - order mode of the mechanical equilibria of self - gravitating systems .",

    "we see that , in our statistical - mechanical approach , as more and more moments and moment equations are involved , more and more expansion coefficients are needed to express the df of equation  ( [ eq : lmpd2 ] ) .",

    "additionally , it might also be unnecessary to invoke the general @xmath129-function other than the boltzmann - gibbs entropy ( cf .",
    "see also the discussion by @xcite about the validity of boltzmann - gibbs statistics when using large deviation tools .",

    "the equilibrium states of self - gravitating systems also consist of mechanical equilibria . by multiplying the steady - state cbe with various powers of velocity , and integrating over all velocities",
    ", we obtain the moment equations of various orders . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appdx ] , we demonstrate that the df @xmath26 is inseparable . as a result ,",

    "the moment equations can be further transformed into the generalized virialization equations  ( [ eq : exvir ] ) , and hence mechanical equilibria are actually identical to the generalized virial equilibria .",
    "one subtlety that should be pointed out is that the df @xmath26 , which satisfies the cbe , is the fine - grained df .",
    "all the velocity moments are derived from this fine - grained df , whereas the important df for statistical mechanics is the coarse - grained df .",
    "although the coarse - grained df does not obey the cbe , fortunately , we find that the coarse - grained moments differ from the fine - grained moments only by up to second - order small quantities determined by the size of the finite volume element .",
    "so , we can safely use these moment equations to characterize the mechanical equilibria of the system .",
    "ergodicity , or the equiprobability principle , is fundamental for equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "however , ergodicity is invalid for the whole collisionless self - gravitating system , because , for example , a gravitating particle moves in a static gravitational field along a specific curve , on which the energy and angular momentum of the particle are conserved .",
    "such a regular motion of the particle is definitely not an ergodic motion , in that the particle can not traverse any place in the system , and also can not attain any value of velocity .",
    "even if the particles are treated as indistinguishable , the validity of global ergodicity can not be recovered , either . according to the ensemble theory ,",
    "the probability distribution of the microstates of a closed system at a fixed energy is derived by assuming that all states on the energy hypersurface in phase space have equal probability .",
    "however , the hypersurface of a constant energy for an isolated self - gravitating system is unbounded .",
    "thus , the microcanonical probability distribution can not be defined , which implies that ergodicity , or equiprobability , is broken .",
    "it seems to be a disaster if global ergodicity is invalid , because the equilibrium statistical mechanics can not exist without the validity of ergodicity .",
    "fortunately , ergodicity can be re - established locally in the following manner . within an imagined finitely small volume element of the system ,",
    "none of the collisionless gravitating particles can be tracked , because these particles are not confined within this limited volume element .",
    "hence , these particles should be treated as indistinguishable . at some instant ,",
    "these particles , randomly and homogeneously populated in the element , exhibit a static distribution pattern .",
    "these different patterns of different instants naturally constitute an ensemble .",
    "when the system is in its equilibrium states , the background field quantities ( i.e. all the velocity moments ) are local invariants , which define a hypersurface for this volume element .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that every member of the ensemble of the local distribution patterns occurs with equal probability in this hypersurface .",
    "intuitively , if within the finitely small element , the particles are randomly and homogenously distributed , and the velocity distribution is independent of spatial coordinates , then the local ergodicity should be valid and can be re - established .",
    "we assume that the minimum phase - space element ( i.e. the microcell ) can accommodate only one gravitating particle , as it is impossible for two gravitating particles to be close to each other but simultaneously to be relatively static .",
    "because of the local ergodicity , the particles will populate these microcells with equal probability , which also indicates that all the microstates for this element occur with equal probability .",
    "so , the microstates of the indistinguishable gravitating particles within this volume element should be counted with fermi - dirac - like statistics .",
    "moreover , because both the direct gravitational interaction and the statistical correlation between any two gravitating particles can be neglected , which is exactly the same reason to justify the cbe , it is reasonable to assert that the microstates of one volume element do not depend on those of any other elements ( i.e. local microstates are spatially independent ) .",
    "hence , the total microstate number of the whole system can be expressed as the product of the microstate number of all the elements .",
    "based on the local ergodicity , and by using fermi - dirac - like statistics , with a non - degenerate condition and the spatial independence of the local microstates , we rederive the boltzmann - gibbs entropy , which is exactly the correct entropy form suitable for collisionless self - gravitating systems . finally , the boltzmann - gibbs entropy is additive and hence extensive , which means that the non - extensive @xcite entropy as well as the general @xmath129-function @xcite are not necessary .",
    "the equilibrium states of self - gravitating systems consist of both mechanical / virial and statistical equilibria , of which the latter should be characterized by the statistical equilibrium equations , derived from entropy principle .",

    "hence , the idea that boltzmann - gibbs statistics can only produce a canonical distribution , such as a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , is not correct .",
    "we also discuss the problems of negative specific heat and ensemble inequivalence .",

    "<S> this is consistent with the validity of the collisionless boltzmann equation , and should be the correct entropy form for collisionless self - gravitating systems . apart from the usual constraints of mass and energy conservation , we demonstrate that the series of moment or virialization equations must be included as additional constraints on the entropy functional when performing the variational calculus ; this is an extension to the original prescription by white & narayan . </S>",
    "<S> any possible velocity distribution can be produced by the statistical - mechanical approach that we have developed with the extended boltzmann - gibbs / white - narayan statistics . finally , we discuss the questions of negative specific heat and ensemble inequivalence for self - gravitating systems .    </S>",
