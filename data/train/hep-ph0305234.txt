    "the precision of present and upcoming high energy experiments is unprecedented and clearly requires an analogous level of accuracy on the theoretical side .",
    "one of the steps towards achieving this goal is to push the level of higher order corrections in perturbation theory further .",
    "however , the calculation of the corresponding feynman diagrams becomes more and more involved as the number of loops and legs of the graphs increases .",
    "typically the occurring tensor integrals are expressed in terms of scalar integrals which are then reduced to a set of master topologies .",
    "these master topologies are the basic ingredients and thus the bottleneck for any attempt to perform a higher order calculation .",
    "a milestone in this respect has been the analytic calculation of the master integrals for the planar  @xcite and non - planar  @xcite massless two - loop box diagrams with on - shell external legs and the ones with one external leg off - shell  @xcite .",
    "these results triggered the analytical computation of two - loop matrix elements for 2 @xmath2 2 scattering processes with on - shell legs  @xcite and 1 @xmath2 3 processes with one off - shell leg  @xcite , which are necessary for the next - to - next - to - leading order calculation of prominent processes like two - jet production in hadronic collisions or three - jet production in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "on the other hand , the two - loop four - point functions with two external legs off - shell still await their analytical calculation .",
    "these integrals are for example needed to calculate the production of two massive vector bosons in hadronic collisions at two loops .",
    "the reason for the lack of analytical results is the increasing number of scales as the number of off - shell legs increases , leading to more complicated analytic structures .",
    "the same argument is true if the diagrams contain massive internal lines .",
    "such diagrams are certainly important in view of a forthcoming @xmath3 collider at tev energies , where the experimental precision will be such that the standard model is tested at the two - loop level . however , a major part of the corresponding two - loop master integrals with massive propagators may not be accessible analytically .",
    "thus the development of numerical methods seems natural to make progress in loop calculations .",
    "this is not at all straightforward , as different kinds of singularities  infrared ( ir ) , ultraviolet ( uv ) and threshold singularities  are present . even in the absence of ir and uv divergences",
    ", one has to face problems due to a complicated analytic structure : for physical kinematics the integral generically has singularities within the integration region , which typically hinder a successful , numerically stable evaluation . at the one - loop level",
    "this problem is less severe because the integration space can be reduced to lower dimensionality and because the analytical structure is completely understood .",
    "solutions for multi - leg one - loop diagrams have been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "however , beyond one loop the problem is not satisfactorily solved in a general and constructive way , although promising approaches have been proposed  @xcite . in the presence of infrared divergences",
    "the situation is even more difficult .",
    "one first has to obtain a numerically integrable function by subtracting the infrared poles . as these poles are in general overlapping , this is a highly non - trivial task . in this paper",
    "we will focus on this problem , i.e. on the isolation of infrared divergences from general multi - loop feynman diagrams .    in  @xcite we proposed a constructive method which enables to calculate multi - loop integrals numerically for unphysical kinematics , and applied it to diagrams with massless propagators .",
    "it served to check the results for the massless on - shell double boxes and to make predictions for the massless doubles boxes with one off - shell leg , the latter being confirmed by the subsequent analytical calculation later .",
    "this method is based on _ sector decomposition _ , originally used to disentangle overlapping uv divergences in the proof of the bphz theorem  @xcite . the basic concept being very simple",
    ", it has a wide range of applicability .",
    "for example , it has been used to derive high energy approximations for one - loop integrals  @xcite .",
    "sector decomposition also has been employed to extract logarithmic mass singularities from massive multi - scale integrals in the high energy limit at two loops  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the concept of sector decomposition has been elaborated to a highly automated program package , allowing to convert dimensionally regulated feynman integrals into a laurent series in @xmath4 .",
    "the coefficients of the poles are sums of multi - dimensional parameter integrals . in a kinematic region where thresholds are absent ,",
    "the latter can be evaluated with standard numerical integration routines . in simple cases ,",
    "analytic integration is also possible .",
    "the numbers of loops and legs are in principle arbitrary , but of course limited by cpu time and disk space .",
    "recently the method has been extended to deal also with phase space integrals  @xcite .    in this article , we show how to generalise the proposed method to arbitrary feynman diagrams .",
    "this is achieved by extending the algorithm to graphs with arbitrary masses and propagator exponents . with these extensions",
    "one is able to deal with very different types of multi - loop / multi - scale problems , most of which are at the edge or beyond the present state of the art of analytic calculations .",
    "more precisely , we present numerical results for massless two - loop 4-point functions with two external legs off - shell , and for the three most difficult master topologies for bhabha scattering at two loops , at two numerical points where @xmath5 .",
    "we also give numerical results for 3-loop , 4-loop and 5-loop massless 2-point functions relevant for the calculation of beta - functions , and finally for the massless on - shell planar 3-loop box diagram .",
    "although we do not provide a solution for arbitrary physical kinematics in general , we note that there is an important class of diagrams , namely diagrams with only one scale , where there is no kinematical restriction .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly present the method , extended to include also non - integer propagator powers , respectively feynman parameters in the numerator . in section 3",
    "we collect applications of the method , presenting numerical results for the types of diagrams listed above .",
    "section 4 contains the discussion of our results and the conclusions .",
    "the formalism of iterated sector decomposition enables to extract in a constructive way the divergences of arbitrary scalar @xmath6-loop @xmath7-point integrals , where the divergences are regularised by dimensional regularisation .",
    "the method has been described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "here we only sketch it briefly , focusing on the features that have not been elaborated previously , i.e. the possibility of arbitrary propagator powers and the inclusion of massive propagators .    a scalar graph @xmath8 with @xmath7 propagators and @xmath6 @xmath9-dimensional loop momenta , where the propagators can have arbitrary , not necessarily integer powers @xmath10 , has the following representation in momentum and feynman parameter space : @xmath11 here @xmath12 are the propagator momenta , i.e. linear combinations of external and loop momenta , @xmath13 .",
    "the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be straightforwardly derived from the momentum representation .",
    "they also can be constructed from the topology of the corresponding feynman graph as follows .    cutting @xmath6 lines of a given connected @xmath6-loop graph such that it becomes a connected tree graph @xmath16 defines a _ chord _ @xmath17 as being the set of lines not belonging to this tree .",
    "the feynman parameters associated with each chord define a monomial of degree @xmath6 .",
    "the set of all such trees ( or _ 1-trees _ ) is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the 1-trees @xmath19 define @xmath14 as being the sum over all monomials corresponding to a chord @xmath20 .",
    "cutting one more line of a 1-tree leads to two disconnected trees , or a _ 2-tree _ @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the set of all such 2-trees .",
    "the corresponding chords define monomials of degree @xmath23 .",
    "each 2-tree of a graph corresponds to a cut defined by cutting the lines which connected the 2 now disconnected trees in the original graph .",
    "the momentum flow through the lines of such a cut defines a lorentz invariant @xmath24 .",
    "the function @xmath25 is the sum over all such monomials times minus the corresponding invariant : @xmath26\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal f}_0(\\vec x ) & = & \\sum\\limits_{\\hat t\\in { \\cal t}_2}\\ ; \\bigl [ \\prod\\limits_{j\\in { \\cal c}(\\hat t ) } x_j \\bigr]\\ , ( -s_{\\hat t})\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal f}(\\vec x ) & = &   { \\cal f}_0(\\vec x ) + { \\cal u}(\\vec x ) \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{n } x_j m_j^2\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14 is a positive semi - definite function .",
    "its vanishing is related to the uv subdivergences of the graph .",
    "overall uv divergences , if present , will always be contained in the prefactor @xmath27 . in the euclidean region , @xmath15 is also a positive semi - definite function of the feynman parameters @xmath28",
    ". its vanishing does not necessarily lead to an ir singularity . only if some of the invariants are zero , for example",
    "if some of the external momenta are light - like , the vanishing of @xmath15 may induce an ir divergence .",
    "thus it depends on the _ kinematics _ and not only on the topology ( like in the uv case ) whether a zero of @xmath15 leads to a divergence or not .",
    "this fact makes it much harder to formulate general theorems on the ir singularity structure of feynman graphs .",
    "examples of @xmath14 and @xmath15 functions will be given below .",
    "in multi - loop integrals , the singular regions  leading to at most @xmath29 infrared poles upon integration in parameter space  are generally _ overlapping _ , such that the set - up of a simple subtraction scheme becomes impossible . in",
    "@xcite we have developed an algorithm and computer program to disentangle such overlapping regions .",
    "it can briefly be sketched as follows :    step 1 : : :    a `` primary '' sector decomposition of all feynman parameters    eliminates the @xmath30-function and maps the integral to    a sum of @xmath7 ( @xmath71)-dimensional parameter    integrals over the unit cube : the decomposition    @xmath31    and appropriate variable substitutions lead to    @xmath32    where @xmath33 contain only positive    semi - definite functions and where the singularities can only be    located at @xmath34 .",
    "step 2 : : :    sector decomposition is performed iteratively for sets of parameters    @xmath35 which make the transformed    @xmath36 or @xmath37 functions    vanish at @xmath38 .",
    "the iteration stops if    @xmath39 and    @xmath40 , where the dots denote    positive semi - definite remainder terms and @xmath41 is    a kinematic invariant which is assumed to be positive . at this point",
    "all divergences are non - overlapping , the poles will be entirely    contained in overall factors    @xmath42 , with @xmath43    a negative integer .",
    "step 3 : : :    subtractions are performed using taylor expansion around    @xmath34 . after subtraction , it is safe to expand in    @xmath4 up to the desired order , leading to the form    @xmath44 note that the method in principle allows to    calculate coefficients of the laurent series in @xmath4    to arbitrary order @xmath45 .",
    "step 4 : : :    the coefficients @xmath46 in ( [ laurent ] ) are sums of    subtracted and expanded subsector integrals in terms of bounded    functions of feynman parameters .",
    "these can be evaluated numerically ,    or even analytically in simple cases .    in",
    "@xcite we were concentrating on massless integrals .",
    "the iteration always stopped , as each sector decomposition reduces the degree of the monomials which are relevant for the ir behaviour of the integral . including propagator masses",
    ", it is clear that the ir behaviour of a diagram can only improve , and hence this extension of the algorithm does not pose any principle problem . on the other hand",
    ", a new technical feature appears , which is that the feynman parameters associated with massive lines occur quadratically in @xmath15 , stemming from the term proportional to @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq0def ] ) . in this case",
    "it is not guaranteed that the iteration stops if one proceeds thoughtlessly .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that a polynomial of the type @xmath47 can produce an endless loop if a sector decomposition in @xmath48 is followed by one in @xmath49 .",
    "a possible way out is to decompose first all parameters which occur quadratically , in our example @xmath50 . then no dangerous situation is present anymore and one can proceed as usual .",
    "the corresponding modification of the code is straightforward , and examples of such a situation are the two - loop qed graphs calculated below .",
    "we note that with the generalisation of the algorithm presented in this article , integrals with arbitrary numerators , and thus tensor integrals , can be treated .",
    "as is well known , after integration over the loop momenta , tensor integrals correspond to linear combinations of integrals with monomials of feynman parameters in the numerator ( times tensors carrying the lorentz structure ) .",
    "these numerators are taken into account by our program and may cancel ir singularities which would be present in the scalar diagram .",
    "another possibility is to express tensor integrals by feynman parameter integrals which do not have polynomial numerators , but are partly in shifted dimensions , as advocated in@xcite . as our method treats the space - time dimension as a parameter , this way is viable as well .",
    "in this section we discuss a number of applications of our algorithm , ranging from 2-loop 4-point functions to 5-loop 2-point functions .",
    "we note that sector decomposition also is useful for the calculation of graphs which are not plagued by ir or uv divergences , as it produces integrands which are bounded and positive definite in kinematic regions where no thresholds are approached .",
    "the technical problem of integrable singularities inside multi - dimensional integration regions hinders the direct computation of the parameter integrals for general kinematics .",
    "however , this is not a limitation intrinsic to our procedure , as more sophisticated numerical integration routines than the one we use could overcome this problem .",
    "however , for the time being , we have to restrict ourselves to the non - physical region , where all mandelstam variables are negative , in the case of the box functions .    for the numerical evaluations we have used the standard monte carlo package",
    "bases @xcite .",
    "the numerical precision for all quoted results is 1% or better .",
    "the integration time for all 2-loop boxes to reach the demanded precision is of the order of an hour on a pc with a pentium iv ( 2ghz ) processor . for the 3-loop propagators the required time is less , whereas for the 5-loop propagator it took a few days to reach this precision .",
    "as the topological functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the basic input for our algorithm , we first give the parameter representation of the general planar and non - planar double box topologies .",
    "these representations are used as a starting point for the particular 2-loop box examples calculated below .",
    "the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the planar double box graph @xmath51 , as shown in fig.([figp]a ) , are given by @xmath52 where we use the short - hand notations @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in the examples considered in the following , we will set some of the @xmath56 and/or @xmath57 to zero .",
    "the parameter representation of the general non - planar double box + @xmath58 , fig.([figp]b ) , is given by @xmath59      for the massless 4-point functions considered in this subsection , two legs are off - shell and the internal lines are massless .",
    "the topologically different positions of the off - shell legs give rise to three master integrals for both the planar- and the non - planar double box with two legs off - shell .",
