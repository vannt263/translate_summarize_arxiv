    "there is great current interest in identifying communities in networks .",
    "informally , communities in networks , or graphs , are subgraphs whose vertices are more strongly connected to one another than to the vertices outside the subgraph .",
    "a variety of approaches have been taken to make concrete the idea of communities , giving rise to a number of efficient methods for community identification ( for useful overviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have introduced a label - propagation algorithm ( lpa ) for identifying network communities .",
    "initially , each vertex in the graph is assigned a unique numeric label .",
    "the label for each vertex is replaced with the most frequent label from its neighbors .",
    "relabeling continues until a stable set of labels is reached .",
    "network communities are defined as the sets of vertices bearing the same labels .",
    "the lpaoffers a number of desirable qualities , including conceptual simplicity , ease of implementation , and practical efficiency ",
    "the algorithm rapidly @xcite finds community assignments of high quality , as measured by the popular modularity measure @xcite .",
    "the lpawas originally presented operationally , with communities defined as the outcome of a specific procedure . in this work",
    ", we consider an equivalent mathematical formulation , in which community solutions are understood in terms of optima of an objective function .",
    "we define an objective function @xmath0 based on the number of edges that connect vertices with identical labels , and show that the lpaidentifies local optima of @xmath0 . this is formally equivalent to minimizing the hamiltonian for a ferromagnetic potts model @xcite .",
    "the mathematical formulation exposes a number of interesting properties of the lpa . a feature of conspicuous importance is that the globally optimal solution for any network is the uninteresting trivial solution in which all vertices are assigned the same label , with other solutions found by label propagation corresponding to suboptimal local maxima of @xmath0 .",
    "the objective function optimized by label propagation thus corresponds poorly to our conceptual understanding of communities  an increase in @xmath0 need not produce what we would consider to be better communities . in particular",
    ", attempts to improve on the label propagation algorithm by facilitating its escape from local maxima in @xmath0 may be counterproductive . we demonstrate that this can create practical difficulties for improvement upon the standard lpa .",
    "we next consider adding a term to the original objective function that penalizes undesirable solutions , producing algorithms that propagate labels subject to constraints .",
    "we examine several possibilities for the penalty term . of special interest",
    "is a penalty term that works to divide vertices into groups of equal total degree , yielding a label propagation variant that strictly maximizes the modularity @xcite while maintaining the favorable computational complexity of the standard lpa .",
    "we characterize the effectiveness of the several label propagation algorithms through application to a model network and a selection of real - world networks .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in we",
    "briefly summarize the original operational presentation of the label propagation algorithm @xcite .",
    "in , we reformulate the label propagation algorithm as a mathematical optimization problem , and in consider drawbacks of the lpathus revealed .",
    "we address the drawbacks in by adding constraints to the optimization problem , with attendant notes on implementation in the appendices .",
    "performance of several label propagation variants are compared in , for both unipartite and bipartite networks .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion in .",
    "the identification of communities in networks is a topic of great recent interest .",
    "formulation of the problem presents two main challenges .",
    "first , the notion of community is imprecise , requiring a definition to be provided for what constitutes a community .",
    "second , community solutions must also be practically realizable for networks of interest .",
    "the interplay between these challenges allows a variety of community definitions and community identification algorithms suited to networks of different sizes , as measured by the number of vertices @xmath1 or edges @xmath2 in the network .    a prominent formulation of the community - identification problem is based on the modularity @xmath3 introduced by @xcite .",
    "the quality of communities given by a partition of the network vertices is assessed by comparing the number of edges between vertices in the same community to the number expected from a null model network .",
    "formally , this is @xmath4 where the @xmath5 are components of the adjacency matrix for the network , and @xmath6 is the community for vertex  @xmath7 .",
    "the presence of the kronecker delta term @xmath8 restricts the sum to edges within communities .",
    "the probability of an edge existing between vertices  @xmath7 and  @xmath9 in the null model network is given by @xmath10 .",
    "the standard choice of null model takes the probability of an edge to be proportional to the product of the degrees @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the vertices , giving @xmath13 with this choice for @xmath10 , the modularity becomes @xmath14 communities are then sought by finding partitions of the set of vertices that have a high value for modularity .",
    "the global maximum of @xmath3 is generally inaccessible , as the number of possible partitions for a set grows too rapidly to be feasibly examined for all but the smallest networks , although effective heuristics exist for finding high modularity solutions .",
    "a seminal example is the greedy agglomerative hierarchical algorithm @xcite , wherein pairs of communities are successively merged so as to cause the largest possible increase in @xmath3 at each step .",
    "recently , @xcite have introduced a label - propagation algorithm ( lpa ) for identifying network communities .",
    "in contrast to the above modularity - based approach , communities are defined in the lpaas vertex partitions identified by a specific algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is conceptually simple in its operation .",
    "initially , each vertex in the graph is assigned a unique numeric label .",
    "the label for each vertex is then replaced with the most frequent label amongst its neighbors ; when several labels are equally frequent , the current label is kept if it is among the most frequent , while otherwise a new label is chosen at random from the most frequent .",
    "vertices are repeatedly relabeled , with the algorithm terminating when the label for each vertex is ( one of ) the most frequent of the labels for the neighbors of the vertex . to avoid possible cycles and ensure termination , @xcite suggest updating the vertex labels asynchronously and in random order .",
    "network communities are then associated with sets of vertices bearing the same labels .",
    "the lpaoffers a number of desirable qualities . as described above , it is conceptually simple , being readily understood and quickly implemented .",
    "communities found can be of high quality , as assessed , e.g. , by the modularity .",
    "the algorithm is efficient in practice .",
    "each relabeling iteration through the vertices has a computational complexity linear in the number of edges in the graph .",
    "the total number of iterations is not _ a priori_clear , but relatively few iterations are needed to assign the final label to most of the vertices ( over 95% of vertices in 5 iterations , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "two related works are of particular note .",
    "first , @xcite have identified the label propagation algorithm as formally equivalent to minimizing the hamiltonian for a kinetic potts model , and used this to argue that , at least in some networks , the identified communities may be meaningless .",
    "additionally , through empirical investigation of two real - world networks , @xcite have shown that the number of distinct community solutions may be very large  much larger than the number of network vertices . taken together ,",
    "these observations highlight the need for further assessment of the quality of communities found using label propagation .",
    "second , @xcite have examined the lpaas a basis for analyzing large networks , focusing on performance characteristics and limitations .",
    "they suggest a number of extensions and optimizations , resulting in a modified algorithm that is able to find communities in a network with tens of millions of edges in a few minutes using a desktop pc .",
    "this study thus suggests that label propagation has tremendous potential as an effective and efficient method for community identification .",
    "thus far , the lpahas been presented operationally  the community solutions are defined as the outcome of a specific procedure . alternatively , an equivalent mathematical formulation , first recognized by @xcite , can be given , where community solutions are understood in terms of the results of applying an optimization procedure to an objective function .",
    "the optimization procedure is the lpa , while the objective function remains to be specified .",
    "the mathematical reformulation thus requires defining the objective function , which provides an alternate means of understanding solutions found by the lpa .    to effect this reformulation",
    ", we first express the lpaoptimization procedure as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the current label for vertex  @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the new label for vertex  @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the set of vertices neighboring @xmath19 in the network , and @xmath21 is the kronecker delta . in the event that multiple values would maximize the sum , the result of @xmath22 should be taken as for the procedural description of lpa , i.e. , keep the current label if it would satisfy , otherwise take a label at random that satisfies .",
    "can be written in terms of the adjacency matrix @xmath23 for the network , giving @xmath24 where @xmath1 is the number of vertices in the network .",
    "consistent with the lpa , the adjacency matrix elements @xmath25 are all elements of @xmath26 . however , the discrete nature of the @xmath25 is never made use of , so the form in is equally applicable to weighted networks .",
    "next , we introduce an objective function @xmath0 that is maximized by the optimization procedure .",
    "intuitively , we can view the lpaas working to assign labels so as to increase the number of edges that connect vertices with identical labels .",
    "formally , this number has the expression @xmath27 can be rewritten in terms of the network adjacency matrix , giving @xmath28 we note that maximizing @xmath0 is equivalent to minimizing the hamiltonian for a ferromagnetic potts model ; this connection has been previously recognized by @xcite . the use of a potts model hamiltonian in network partitioning has been explored in depth by @xcite .",
    "it remains to be verified that the optimization rule in does in fact maximize the objective function in .",
    "consider updating the label for some vertex  @xmath29 .",
    "we rewrite to treat vertex  @xmath29 separately , yielding @xmath30 taking advantage of the symmetry of the adjacency matrix , we can simplify , giving @xmath31 the final term on the right hand side of is exactly of the form maximized by the lpaoptimization rule as expressed in , while the other terms are independent of the label on vertex  @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the objective function never decreases under the action of the lpa , ultimately reaching a local maximum or limit cycle .",
    "an important property of the label propagation algorithm is immediately apparent from the form of @xmath0 . for any network , the lpaallows an uninteresting trivial solution in which all vertices are assigned the same label @xcite . from @xmath0",
    ", we see that the trivial solution is in fact the globally optimal solution .",
    "other solutions found by label propagation correspond to local maxima of @xmath0 .",
    "as the lpaoptimization procedure in produces only local changes , the search for maxima in @xmath0 is prone to becoming trapped at a local optimum instead of the global optimum .",
    "while normally a drawback of local search algorithms , this characteristic is essential to the function of the lpa : the trivial optimal solution is avoided by the dynamics of the local search algorithm , rather than through formal exclusion .",
    "the label propagation algorithm as a search scheme thus depends on a certain degree of ineffectuality .",
    "a typical way to attempt improvement of a local search algorithm is to make it more able to escape from local maxima in @xmath0 .",
    "such improvements to the lpamay be quite counterproductive , as better solutions in terms of @xmath32notably , the global maximum  may be quite useless in practical terms . despite this , label propagation in practice can produce communities that are of high quality in terms of , e.g. , modularity : the local maxima are frustrated equilibria , with localized groups of well - connected vertices having the same label and with comparatively few edges between the groups .",
    "generally , there is a poor correspondence between @xmath0 and our conceptual understanding of communities . maximizing @xmath32 , be it by label propagation or another approach , need not produce better communities .",
    "regardless , using the lpaworks by maximizing @xmath0 , raising the question of whether , and in what sense , we are improving community quality .",
    "operationally , it is again unclear what it might mean to try improving the lpa .",
    "does improving the search efficacy actually give better communities ?",
    "how do we prevent our optimizations from reaching the global maximum of @xmath0 , or other uninteresting solutions with high values of @xmath0 ?",
    "to illustrate the difficulties involved , we consider a possible optimization of the label propagation algorithm . when a vertex label is to be updated , it is necessary to handle the case where multiple labels are equally frequent for the neighboring vertices . in the standard lpa ,",
    "these ties are broken by keeping the current label for the vertex , if it is one of the most frequent , or otherwise by selecting a label at random from the most frequent . in our optimized version",
    ", we will always select a label at random from the most frequent ; in light of this additional randomization , we denote the modified algorithm as lpar . the tie - breaking rule for the standard lpacorresponds to halting when a plateau in the @xmath0 space is reached , while lparcorresponds to allowing a random walk on the plateau in search of better solutions .    in",
    ", we show the number of communities found for one thousand applications of the standard lpaand the putatively optimized lparto networks derived from the southern women data .",
    "the data were collected by @xcite as part of an extensive study of class and race in the deep south .",
    "the network represents interactions of a group of 18 women at 14 various events in and around natchez , mississippi during the 1930s .",
    "this much - studied network is typically found to have two communities using methods of social network analysis @xcite , in accord with the conclusions from the original ethnographic study .",
    "unfortunately , our attempted optimization has a perverse result with the southern women network : the principal effect of the optimization is to drastically increase the frequency at which the algorithm assigns the same label to all vertices , failing to capture any aspect of the known community structure .        at least in the southern women network ,",
    "several practical drawbacks arise from the key conceptual drawback discussed above .",
    "optimization is made difficult , as seen in this case based on comparison with a known community structure .",
    "further , the objective function optimized by lpaprovides no mechanism for testing the quality of the resulting community solutions  we must instead assess quality through auxiliary considerations such as the number of communities or , e.g. , the modularity @xmath3 of the community solution .",
    "a well - established approach for eliminating undesirable solutions is to modify the objective function by adding a constraint term that penalizes the undesirable solutions . denoting the modified objective function as @xmath33 and the penalty term as @xmath34",
    ", we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a parameter that weights @xmath34 against the original objective function @xmath0 . numerous choices are possible for @xmath34 ; we consider three possibilities below .    within the specific area of communication identification , the approach has been used at least since the landmark paper by @xcite applying methods of statistical mechanics to combinatorial optimization problems , including graph bipartitioning .",
    "we base a first penalty term @xmath37 on their classic work .",
    "we seek to divide the vertices into groups of the same size . in terms of the labels ,",
    "we define @xmath38 the penalty term @xmath37 produces the smallest value when all vertices have unique labels , and the largest value when all vertices have the same label .",
    "thus , the trivial global optimum of @xmath0 is penalized and hopefully avoided .    alternatively , following a strategy that mirrors contemporary methods for community detection",
    ", we can try to divide the vertices into groups which have a similar total degree .",
    "we define a second penalty term @xmath39 to capture this idea .",
    "the total degree @xmath40 of the vertices with a given label @xmath41 is @xmath42 where @xmath11 is the degree of vertex  @xmath7 .",
    "a suitable definition for @xmath43 is @xmath44 as with @xmath45 , @xmath43 is minimal when all vertices have unique labels and maximal when all vertices have the same label , working to avoid the trivial global optimum .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath43 in the form @xmath46 incorporating @xmath43 into @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath47 if we select @xmath48 where @xmath2 is the number of edges in the network , the objective function may be written as @xmath49 in , @xmath3 is the standard modularity measure @xcite .    recalling that the label propagation rule as given by requires only that a symmetric matrix be used , we can see from that modularity can be be locally maximized by the label propagation algorithm ; we denote this modularity - specialized algorithm as lpam .",
    "implementation issues are described in appendix  sec : lpamimplementation .",
    "we note that lpam , due to the effect of @xmath43 , is well suited to aggressive optimization , but we do not pursue such optimizations in the present work .",
    "the penalty term @xmath43 plays the same role as the null model network used to define the modularity ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the idea holds quite generally : various null model networks could be used to define specialized modularity measures , or penalty terms could equivalently be introduced into the objective function .",
    "this allows the interesting historical interpretation that @xcite made use of a modularity measure for community identification over two decades ago .    as a further example",
    ", we develop an analogous label propagation algorithm to maximize a recently introduced @xcite version of modularity adapted to the important special class of bipartite networks .",
    "the vertices of a bipartite network can be partitioned into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent ; equivalently , the vertices in a bipartite graph can be assigned one of two colors , say red and blue , with no edges present between vertices bearing the same color .",
    "there are thus two distinct kinds of vertices , providing a natural representation for many affiliation or interaction networks , with one kind of vertex representing actors and the other representing relations .",
    "the distinction between the two parts of the network can be incorporated into a modularity measure by defining a suitable null network model .",
    "in contrast to the standard choice given in , the two kinds of vertices must be treated separately , with non - zero probability of an edge only between vertices belonging to different parts of the network . for a red vertex @xmath7 with degree @xmath50 and a blue vertex @xmath9 with degree @xmath51 ,",
    "the null model is defined so that @xmath52 using , the bipartite modularity @xmath53 is @xmath54 the sums in are to be interpreted as running over the vertices in the two parts of the network , i.e. , @xmath7 is restricted to run over only the red vertices , while @xmath9 is restricted to run over only the blue vertices .",
    "for the present work , it is simpler to allow unrestricted sums over all the vertices . to do this , for each vertex",
    "@xmath19 we associate two degree measures , a red degree @xmath55 and a blue degree @xmath56 .",
    "if vertex  @xmath19 is red , we require @xmath57 , while if it is blue we require @xmath58 . in either case , the non - zero degree is the number of edges incident on the vertex . with this construction , becomes @xmath59 where now the sums run over all vertices .",
    "we now define a penalty term @xmath60 for bipartite networks as @xmath61 where @xmath62 adapt to bipartite networks .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath60 as @xmath63 writing the full objective function , we have @xmath64 with @xmath65 becomes @xmath66 the label propagation rule can again be used to maximize the bipartite modularity ; we denote the algorithm as lpab .",
    "implementation issues for lpabare treated in appendix  sec : lpabimplementation .",
    "we now turn to a comparison of the quality of solutions found by the various label propagation algorithms discussed above . to quantify the solution quality , we will focus principally on the modularity @xmath3 , although it is not strictly optimized except by lpam .",
    "along with the lpa , lpar , and lpamvariants discussed above , we will additionally consider a hybrid algorithm , consisting of the standard lpafollowed by optimization with lpam .",
    "the hybrid approach ensures that we are at a maximum in the modularity , rather than just finding a solution that hopefully offers a high value of @xmath3 .    to begin",
    ", we apply the algorithms to randomly generated networks with a known community structure . the most typical such class of networks , introduced by @xcite , consists of four communities , each containing 32 vertices .",
    "edges exist between pairs of vertices belonging to the same community with probability @xmath67 and between all other pairs of vertices with probability @xmath68 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath67 and @xmath68 are set so as to preserve the average degree @xmath69 of the vertices at a value of 16 , while varying the average number of edges  @xmath70 between a vertex and members of other communities . as @xmath70 increases",
    ", the communities become increasingly difficult to identify .",
    "although these model networks differ significantly from real networks with community structure @xcite , they do provide a simple initial test of community detection algorithms .    in",
    ", we show the modularity values for communities found by the four algorithms . each point shown",
    "gives the average modularity from communities found in 1000 instances of the random network model .",
    "as expected , @xmath3 drops as @xmath70 increases .     of community solutions from random networks with known community structures .",
    "each point shows the average @xmath3 over 1000 instances of the random networks in relation to the average number @xmath70 of inter - community links for each vertex .",
    "the hybrid algorithm consists of allowing the standard lpato run its course and find a solution , followed by application of lpamto the lpasolution in order to ensure that a local maximum of @xmath3 is reached .",
    "error bars are smaller than the points . ]    since we know the actual communities for the model networks , we may additionally assess the accuracy of the label assignments by directly comparing to the known values .",
    "we use the normalized mutual information @xmath71 @xcite for the comparison . consider two schemes @xmath72 and @xmath73 for dividing the @xmath74 vertices into community groups .",
    "the probability @xmath75 that a vertex is assigned to community @xmath76 in scheme @xmath72 and to community @xmath77 in scheme @xmath73 is taken to be proportional to the size of the intersection between the sets of vertices @xmath78 and @xmath79 constituting the communities , so that @xmath80 using the probability as defined in , we can calculate the normalized mutual information as @xmath81 is expressed in terms of the usual mutual information @xmath82 and entropies @xmath83 and @xmath83 @xcite , defined as @xmath84 in , we have made use of the common shorthand abbreviations @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . the base of the logarithms in is arbitrary , as the computed measures only appear in the ratio in .    the normalized mutual information allows us to measure the amount of information common to two different partitioning schemes .",
    "accordingly , we can explore the efficacy of the algorithm by taking one of the partitions to be the known modular structure of the model networks and the other to be the structure found using label propagation . when the found modules match the real ones , we have @xmath88 , and when they are independent of the real ones , we have @xmath89 .",
    "thus , as @xmath70 increases , we expect @xmath71 to decrease . in , we present values of @xmath71 from comparison of the real communities to the same community solutions used for the @xmath3 calculations in , observing the expected decrease from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .     between the found and actual community solutions",
    "each point shows the normalized mutual information @xmath71 over 1000 instances of the random networks in relation to the average number @xmath70 of inter - community links for each vertex .",
    "the hybrid algorithm consists of allowing the standard lpato run its course and find a solution , followed by application of lpamto the lpasolution in order to ensure that a local maximum of @xmath3 is reached .",
    "error bars are smaller than the points . ]    from , it is tempting to conclude that lpamis superior to the other label propagation variants .",
    "however , this conclusion is not borne out when the algorithms are applied to real networks . in",
    ", we list several networks that we have investigated using the label propagation algorithms .",
    "the networks considered are a network of friendships between members of a university karate club @xcite ; a network of frequent associations between dolphins living near doubtful sound , new zealand @xcite ; a network of collaborations between jazz musicians @xcite ; a network of co - authorships for scientific papers concerning networks @xcite ; and a network of co - authorships for scientific preprints posted to the condensed matter archive @xcite between the years 1995 and 2003 @xcite .",
    "we give their sizes in terms of the number of vertices @xmath1 and number of edges @xmath2 . to indicate the degree",
    "to which the networks feature community structures , we also provide the modularity @xmath3 , as determined using a greedy agglomerative hierarchical ( gah ) method based on that of @xcite , wherein pairs of communities are successively merged so as to cause the largest possible increase in @xmath3 at each step .",
    "while edge weights are available in some cases , in this work we uniformly treat all network edges as unweighted .",
    ".basic properties of networks used to test label propagation algorithm variants .",
    "the sizes of the network are described by the number of vertices @xmath1 and number of edges @xmath2 .",
    "each network has significant modular character , as indicated by the modularity @xmath3 . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     despite the success of lpabon the southern women network , it is less successful on the other networks .",
    "performance is quite similar for lpaand lpabon the scotland corporate interlocks network , but lpabis otherwise outperformed by the other label propagation variants .",
    "indeed , lparprovides the best results for the larger networks , in contrast to its poor results for the southern women network .",
    "values of @xmath53 for community solutions found using the label propagation variants are generally somewhat less than the values , shown in , for communities found using a greedy agglomerative hierarchical approach .",
    "we have examined the label - propagation algorithm as an optimization problem , identifying community solutions that it finds with the maxima of an objective function .",
    "the objective function , which is just the number of network edges connecting vertices with the same labels , has the significant conceptual drawback that increasing the objective function need not produce what we would consider to be better communities .",
    "markedly , the globally optimal solution is completely uninformative , with all vertices in the same community .",
    "label propagation thus depends on reaching one of the large number of local maxima in the objective function to avoid the trivial global solution .",
    "attempts to improve on the algorithm may be counterproductive , giving less information while reaching nominally better solutions . by modifying the objective function",
    ", we defined several label - propagation algorithms that are constrained to avoid assigning all vertices to the same community .",
    "one of the constrained label - propagation algorithms , lpam , finds local maxima in the modularity @xmath3 ; another , lpab , finds local maxima in a modified modularity @xmath53 for bipartite networks .",
    "although formally equivalent , there are important conceptual differences between the usual definition of the modularity @xmath90 in terms of a null model network and the version based on constraints presented here .",
    "for example , the parameter @xmath91 seems quite arbitrarily chosen in the constraint - based version .",
    "in fact , the community solutions found by lpamare not especially sensitive to the choice of @xmath36 .",
    "the value can , for instance , be cut in half to @xmath92 with significant change only in the case of the mean modularity for zachary s karate network  in which the mean modularity value actually increases by about 10% .",
    "more significantly , the constraint as given in makes clear that modularity favors communities of similar size , with size measured by the total degree of the vertices in the community . as the distribution of community sizes may be far from uniform ( see , for example , fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the constraint approach points immediately towards a practical difficulty in detecting community by maximizing modularity .",
    "in contrast , difficulties due to varying community sizes were recognized @xcite only some time after the original introduction of modularity using a null model .",
    "corresponding properties hold in the case of the bipartite modularity @xmath53 .",
    "again , @xmath36 seems arbitrarily chosen ; halving the parameter value to @xmath93 again only causes a significant change for the small southern women network , increasing the mean bipartite modularity found by about 10% . in the bipartite case ,",
    "communities of similar size are also favored , but the relevant size is now the geometric mean of the total degrees within the community for the two parts of the network , as seen in .",
    "we thus expect that community identification methods based on maximizing @xmath53 will also have difficulties with networks consisting of communities of diverse sizes .",
    "although this latter fact has been anticipated @xcite based on parallels to the unipartite case , it has not been previously demonstrated .    in light of the results for the real - world networks ( for unipartite networks , for bipartite networks )",
    ", it seems clear that the main label propagation variants we have considered  lpa , lpam , lpar , lpab  all give good community results .",
    "the performance differences indicate that the algorithm variants explore slightly different portions of the community solution space .",
    "no variant is clearly superior , which is not surprising given that we are trying to identify communities without prior information on their number , size , or nature .",
    "when compared to the modularity values for community solutions generated by greedy agglomerative hierarchical methods , the label propagation variants appear to provide no advantage or , in the case of bipartite networks , to entail a distinct disadvantage .",
    "we stress that the difference in modularity values should not be overvalued , for two main reasons .",
    "first , the modularity measure , while popular , is not the only possibility , nor is it without drawbacks ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "second , the algorithms are quite different , so no single point of comparison will be determinative in general . a more thorough characterization of performance is needed to establish reliable guidelines for choosing appropriate algorithms to analyze particular networks ; this will be the subject of future work .",
    "the performance of lpamis especially interesting : although it is the only variant directly maximizing @xmath3 , other variants produce better results in terms of @xmath3 for some of the networks considered .",
    "this appears to be due to a fundamental difference in the role played by the modularity in the algorithm variants .",
    "lacking an objective function , @xcite used the modularity of the final community solution to assess the acceptability of their lpa , as did we when assessing lparin the present work .",
    "thus , in lpaand lpar , the modularity is used diagnostically to select a best result from candidate solutions produced based on other considerations .",
    "in contrast , the modularity plays an essential role in lpam , impacting the final community solution as well as the intermediate community states reached during the course of the algorithm .",
    "the dynamical path followed through the space of label assignments is driven to favor states where all communities are similar in total degree , although there is little reason to believe such paths are universally ideal or particularly free of local maxima .",
    "thus , the null model network used in defining the modularity  regardless of its suitability as a model of the final communities  may be an impractical model of the intermediate communities .",
    "this might be addressed by varying @xmath34 , gradually introducing the penalty term @xmath43 and thus the null network mode .",
    "similar considerations hold for lpaband the corresponding null network models for bipartite networks .",
    "overall , we have found the label propagation algorithm to be a promising approach to understanding networks , with a number of desirable qualities .",
    "label propagation seems well suited as a basis for more specialized community - detection methods , as well as application to other aspects of networks besides community structure .",
    "a clear understanding of the drawbacks of label propagation , as well as its strengths , will help to avoid problems and facilitate further applications .",

    "the label propagation algorithm presented by @xcite has desirable performance properties .",
    "each relabeling iteration through the vertices has a computational ( time ) complexity @xmath94 linear in the number of edges @xmath2 in the graph . for many networks , the number of vertices @xmath74 scales with the number of edges , so the computational complexity for each relabeling step",
    "can instead be given as @xmath95 .",
    "as seen in , the objective function for the lpacan be constrained to reproduce the modularity .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to adapt the algorithm itself to obtain an efficient procedure for maximizing the modularity .",
    "modifications can be made so as to maintain the @xmath96 time complexity .",
    "here , we consider the constraint @xmath43 given in , i.e. , we implement lpam .    first , consider the objective function from .",
    "recall that the lpaupdate rule ( ) can be applied with any symmetric matrix @xmath97 playing the role of the adjacency matrix @xmath25 ( see ) .",
    "further , it is clear that the objective function may be shifted by adding an arbitrary constant @xmath98 without altering the locations of the maxima in the space of label assignments . by setting @xmath99 , we eliminate the diagonal elements @xmath100 from consideration , producing an objective function @xmath101 and update rule @xmath102 the above transformation eliminates constant self - interaction terms .",
    "next , identify @xmath97 as @xmath103 to match the lpamvariant , giving @xmath104 or , equivalently , @xmath105 the first sum in corresponds to the counting of labels on neighboring vertices in the original label propagation algorithm .",
    "write this as @xmath106 the second sum in can be rewritten as @xmath107 where @xmath108 analogously to the volume of a graph , @xmath109 can be viewed as a sort of volume for the labels .    incorporating into , we obtain @xmath110 the modified label propagation rule , as expressed in ,",
    "can be readily implemented so that each pass through the vertices requires @xmath96 worst - case time complexity .",
    "the algorithm is initialized by assigning a unique numerical label @xmath41 to each vertex and by setting @xmath40 to the degree of the vertex .",
    "the first term , @xmath111 , requires that the labels of the neighbors for each vertex be counted and is thus @xmath96 ; this is unsurprising as it is equivalent to the unmodified label propagation algorithm , which is @xmath96 .",
    "the second term appears to require that each possible label be checked for each vertex , giving @xmath112 .",
    "however , it is only necessary to consider the labels of the neighbors for each vertex  no other label can make a positive contribution to the modularity , but a zero contribution can be had by assigning an unused label .",
    "a list of unused labels can be kept , allowing @xmath113 access .",
    "additionally , the @xmath40 must be updated if the label changes , but this is also @xmath113 for each vertex . in total , checking and updating the @xmath40 terms for all vertices",
    "is @xmath96 .",
    "the final term in is @xmath114 in total . with all three terms taken into account ,",
    "the modified algorithm thus has worst - case @xmath96 time complexity .",
    "in , we have presented an objective function corresponding to the bipartite modularity @xmath53 , with form @xmath115 we can not directly apply the label propagation update rule from , as @xmath116 is in general asymmetric . despite this , we can define a label propagation rule for @xmath33 .",
    "we rewrite by first taking advantage of the symmetry of @xmath25 and @xmath117 , giving @xmath118 next , we switch the dummy indices @xmath17 and @xmath19 , resulting in @xmath119 averaging , we obtain @xmath120 which is in terms of a symmetric matrix and thus suitable for use with .",
    "the objective function , as expressed in , can be converted into the lpablabel propagation rule for bipartite modularity in a fashion directly parallel to that presented in appendix  sec : lpamimplementation .",
    "the resulting update rule has the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 by updating @xmath123 and @xmath124 when labels change , the algorithm can be implemented efficiently .",
    "the details , omitted here , are similar to those given in appendix  sec : lpamimplementation and result in the same @xmath96 worst - case time complexity for each iteration of lpab ."
