    "in his seminal work _ sums of circuits _ @xcite , paul seymour stated the following conjecture , which he has addressed as a `` folklore conjecture , probably due to tutte . ''",
    "[ conj:1 ] any bridgeless cubic graph can be embedded on a surface of its own genus in such a way that the perimeters of all regions are circuits .",
    "as much as this conjecture was folklore in the nineteen seventies , today s methods of topological graph theory enable rather easy constructions of counterexamples .",
    "there is evidence that several people were aware that conjecture [ conj:1 ] is false for toroidal graphs .",
    "apparently , an example of a toroidal cubic graph disproving conjecture [ conj:1 ] appears in the ph.d .",
    "thesis of xuong @xcite .",
    "richter @xcite found further examples of 2-connected ( but not 3-connected ) cubic graphs of genus one for which the conjecture fails .",
    "zha @xcite constructed graphs @xmath0 , for each integer @xmath1 , whose genus is @xmath2 , but every embedding in the orientable surface of genus @xmath2 has a face that is not bounded by a cycle of the graph .",
    "( the examples of zha are not cubic graphs , though . )",
    "it is also stated by zha in @xcite that archdeacon and stahl , and huneke , richter , and younger ( respectively ) informed him of having constructed further examples of toroidal cubic graphs disproving conjecture [ conj:1 ] .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to bring a rich new family of counterexamples to the attention of interested graph theorists .",
    "our real goal is to provide simple examples , yet powerful enough to exhibit some additional extremal properties . in particular , we shall consider ( cubic ) graphs of genus one .",
    "if a cubic graph @xmath3 has an embedding in the torus with a face whose boundary is not a cycle , then @xmath3 contains an edge @xmath4 whose removal yields a planar graph .",
    "we call such a graph _ near - planar _ and refer to the edge @xmath4 as a _ planarizing edge _ ( see @xcite )",
    ". our main result , theorem [ thm:1 ] , gives a simple recipe for constructing near - planar ( cubic ) graphs , all of whose embeddings of small genus have facial walks that are not cycles .",

    "conjecture [ conj:1 ] claims that @xmath8 for every bridgeless cubic graph @xmath3 .    the well - known _ cycle double cover conjecture _ claims that every 2-edge - connected graph admits a collection of cycles such that every edge is contained in precisely two of the cycles from the collection .",
    "such a collection is called a _ cycle double cover _ of the graph .",

    "suppose that @xmath3 has a strong embedding @xmath55 in a surface of genus @xmath2 , and consider a facial cycle @xmath56 containing the edge @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath56 intersects all cycles @xmath52 and hence contains , for each @xmath58 , a path @xmath59 joining @xmath39 and @xmath54 . since every edge belongs to two facial cycles only , this implies that there is a facial cycle @xmath60 in the planar embedding of @xmath49 that contains an edge in @xmath59 and is not @xmath55-facial .",
    "since @xmath49 is a subdivided 3-connected graph , the cycle @xmath60 is induced and nonseparating . by lemma [ lem : facial or non - separating ] , @xmath60 is surface - non - separating under the embedding  @xmath55 .",
    "let us now consider the cycles @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "since each @xmath60 is induced and @xmath63 are at distance at least two from each other , the union @xmath64 of these cycles is an induced subgraph of @xmath3 .",

    "the graph has @xmath82 disjoint cycles that show that @xmath83 in the planar embedding of @xmath84 .",
    "now , theorem [ thm:1 ] applies .",
    "let us observe that euler s formula implies that _ every _ orientable ( 2-cell ) embedding of the graphs @xmath78 from corollary [ cor:1 ] has genus at most @xmath85 .",
    "the largest possible genus of a strong embedding of @xmath78 is @xmath86 , and this bound is attained if and only if @xmath78 has a cycle double cover consisting of three hamilton cycles of @xmath78 .",

    "the proof is essentially the same as the proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] .",
    "let us only remark the main differences .",
    "first of all , there are pairwise disjoint subgraphs @xmath26 ( @xmath53 ) , where each @xmath39 is a union of cycles ( i.e. an eulerian subgraph ) of @xmath27 that separates the surface so that one part ( called the _ interior _ of @xmath39 , @xmath87 ) contains @xmath17 and the previous cycles @xmath88 , and the other part of the surface ( the _ exterior _",
    "@xmath89 ) contains @xmath18 and @xmath90 .",

    "we set @xmath68 . for @xmath91 , having constructed @xmath92 , we take @xmath93 together with all facial cycles that intersect @xmath92 and denote this subgraph of @xmath3 by @xmath87 .",

    "( if @xmath3 is a cubic graph , then @xmath39 is disjoint union of one or more cycles , but in general , it is just an eulerian subgraph of @xmath3 . )",
    "the rest of the proof is the same as for theorem  [ thm:1 ] .",
    "in view of the cycle double cover conjecture and its embedding counterpart ( conjecture [ conj : oricdc ] ) , it is of interest to show that ( cubic ) graphs of small genus admit strong embeddings in some surface .",
    "some existing work in this area is @xcite .",
    "let us remark that for cubic graphs this follows from known results about possible counterexamples to the cycle double cover conjecture .",
    "goddyn @xcite proved that a minimum counterexample has girth at least 10 , and huck @xcite extended this further by proving that its girth is at least 12 .",
    "the reductions used in those proofs can be made so that embeddability in a fixed surface is preserved .",
    "they can be summarized as follows .",
    "[ thm : huck ] let @xmath94 be an integer . if there is a 2-edge - connected graph whose genus ( or non - orientable genus ) is at most @xmath2 and that does not have a cycle double cover , then there is such a graph @xmath3 with the following properties :        [ cor:2 ] if a 2-edge - connected graph @xmath3 has genus at most 16 or has nonorientable genus at most 33 , then it has a cycle double cover . in particular ,",
    "if it is cubic , then it admits a strong embedding in some surface .    by theorem [ thm : huck ]",
    ", we may assume that @xmath3 is cubic and has girth at least 12 .",
    "the girth condition implies that the order @xmath96 of @xmath3 satisfies @xmath97 since @xmath3 is cubic , @xmath98 .",
    "since every facial walk has length at least 12 , we have that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the number of facial walks . by euler s formula , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the euler characteristic of the surface in which @xmath3 is embedded .",
    "this implies that @xmath103 . in particular",
    ", the genus ( or the nonorientable genus ) is at least 17 ( respectively , 34 ) .",
    "the proofs of goddyn @xcite and huck @xcite do not preserve orientability of embeddings , so it remains an open problem if the last conclusion of corollary [ cor:2 ] can be strengthened by concluding that a strong embedding in some orientable surface exists .",
    "a recent paper by ellingham and zha @xcite discusses this problem and provides a solution for projective - planar graphs .        if conjecture [ conj : oricdc ] is true , then the answer to problem [ prb:1 ] is trivial  such an embedding exists if and only if the input graph is 2-edge - connected . on the other hand ,",
