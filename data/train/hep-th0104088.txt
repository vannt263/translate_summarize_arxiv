    "the very notion of _ really existing objects _ , i.e. _ physical objects carrying energy - momentum _ , necessarily implies that all such objects must have definite stability properties , as well as propertiies that do not change with time ; otherwise everything would constantly change and we could not talk about objects and structure at all , moreover no memory and no knowledge would be possible . through definite procedures of _ measurement _ we determine , where and when this is possible , quantitative characteristics of the physical objects .",
    "the characteristics obtained differ in : their nature and qualities ; in their significance to understand the structure of the objects they characterize ; in their abilities to characterize interaction among objects ; and in their universality .",
    "natural objects may be classified according to various principles .",
    "the classical point - like objects ( called usually particles ) are allowed to interact continuously with each other just through exchanging ( through some mediator usually called field ) universal conserved quantities : energy , momentum , angular momentum , so that , the set of objects `` before '' interaction is the same as the set of objects `` after '' interaction , no objects have disapeared and no new objects have appeared , only the conserved quantities have been redistributed .",
    "this is in accordance with the assumption of point - likeness , i.e. particles are assumed to have no internal structure , so they are undestroyable . hence",
    ", classical particles may be subject only to elastic interaction .    turning to study the set of microobjects , called usually elementary particles : photons , electrons , etc .",
    ", physicists have found out , in contrast to the case of classical particles , that a given set of microobjects may transform into _ another _ set of microobjects under definite conditions , for example , the well known anihilation process : @xmath5 .",
    "these transformations obey also the energy - momentum and angular+spin momentum conservation , but some features may disapear ( e.g. the electric charge ) and new features ( e.g. motion with the highest velosity ) may appear .",
    "hence , microobjects _ allow to be destroyed _",
    ", so they have structure and , consequently , they would not admit the approximation `` point - like objects '' . in view of this",
    "we may conclude that any theory aiming to describe their behaviour must take in view their structure . in particular , assuming that the planck formula @xmath3 is valid for a free microobject , the only reasonable way to understand where the characteristic _ frequency _ comes from is to assume that this microobject has a periodic dynamical structure .",
    "the idea of conservation as a dynamics generating rule was realized and implemented in physics firstly by newton a few centuries ago in the frame of real ( classical ) bodies : he invented the quantity _ momentum _",
    ", @xmath6 , for an isolated body ( treated as a point , or structureless object ) , as its integral characteristic , postulated its time - constancy ( i.e. conservation ) , and wrote down his famous equation @xmath7=@xmath8 . this equation says , that the integral characteristic _ momentum _ of a given point - like object may ( smoothly ) increase _ only _ if some other object loses ( smoothly ) the same quantity of _ momentum_. the concept of _ force _ , @xmath8 , measures the momentum transfered per unit time .",
    "the conservative quantities _ energy _ and _ angular momentum _ ,",
    "consistent with the momentum conservation , were also appropriately incorporated .",
    "the most _ universal _ among these turned out to be _ the energy _ , since , as far as we know , every natural object carries energy .",
    "this property of universality of energy makes it quite distinguished among the other conservative quantities , because its change may serve as a relyable measure of _ any _ kind of interaction and transformation of real objects .",
    "we especially note , that all these conservative quantities are carried by some object(s ) , _ no energy - momentum can exist without corresponding objects - carryers_. in this sense , the usual words `` energy quanta '' are sensless if the corresponding carryers are not pointed out .",
    "so , theoretical physics started with idealizing the natural objects as particles , i.e. objects _ without structure _ , and the real world was theoreticaly viewed as a collection of _ interacting _ , i.e. energy - momentum exchanging , particles .",
    "as far as the behaviour of the real objects as a whole is concerned , and the interactions considered do not lead to destruction of the bodies - particles , this theoretical model of the real world worked well .    the 19th century physics , due mainly to faraday and maxwell , created the theoretical concept of _ electromagnetic field _ as the _ interaction carrying object _ , responsible for the observed mutual influence between distant electrically charged ( point - like ) objects .",
    "this concept presents the electromagnetic field as an extended ( in fact , infinite ) continuous object , having dynamical structure , and although it influences the behaviour of the charged particles , it does not destroy them .",
    "the theory of the electromagnetic field was based also on balance relations of new kind of quantities .",
    "actually , the new concepts of _ flux of a vector field through a 2-dimensional surface _ and _ circulation of a vector field along a closed curve _ were coined and used extensively .",
    "the faraday - maxwell equations in their integral form establish , in fact , where the time - changes of the fluxes of the electric and magnetic fields go to , or come from , in both cases of a _ closed _",
    "2-surface , and of a _ not - closed _",
    "2-surface with a boundary , and in this sense they introduce a kind of _ ballance relations_. we note , that these fluxes are new quantities , specific to the continuous character of the physical object under consideration ; the field equations of faraday - maxwell do not express directly energy - momentum balance relations as the above mentioned newton s law @xmath9 does . nevertheless , they are consistent with energy - momentum conservation , as it is well known .",
    "the corresponding local energy - momentum quantities turn out to be quadratic functions of the electric and magnetic vectors .",
    "although very useful for considerations in finite regions with boundary conditions , the pure field maxwell equations have time - dependent solutions in the whole space that could hardly be considered as mathematical models of really existing fields . as a rule ,",
    "if these solutions are time - stable and not static , they occupy the whole 3-space , or its infinite sub - region ( e.g. plane waves ) , and , hence , they carry _ infinite _ energy and momentum ( infinite objects ) . on the other hand , according to cauchy s theorem for the dalembert wave equation [ 1 ] , which is necessarily satisfied by any component of the vacuum field in maxwell theory , every _ finite _ ( and smooth enough ) initial field configuration is strongly time - unstable : the initial condition blows up radially and goes to infinity , and its forefront and backfront propagate with the velocity of light . hence , faraday - maxwell equations _ can not describe finite time - stable _ localized field - objects .",
    "the inconsistences between theory and experiment appeared in a full scale at the end of the last century and it soon became clear that they were not avoidable in the frame of classical physics .",
    "after planck and einstein created the notion of _ elementary field quanta _",
    ", named later by lewis [ 2 ] _ photon _ , physicists faced the above mentioned problem : the light quanta appeared to be real objects of a new kind , namely , they did not admit the point - like approximation like newton s particles did .",
    "in fact , every photon propagates ( transitionally ) as a whole with a _ constant _ velocity and keeps unchanged the energy - momentum it carries , which _ should _ mean that it is a _",
    "free _ object . on the other hand",
    ", it satisfies planck s relation @xmath3 , which means that the very existence of photons is intrinsically connected with a periodical process of frequency @xmath10 , and periodical processes in classical physics are generated by _",
    "external _ force - fields , which means that the object _ should not _ be free .",
    "the efforts to overcome this undesirable situation resulted in the appearence of quantum theory , quantum electrodynamics was built , but the assumption `` the point - like approximation works '' _ was kept as a building stone _ of the new theory , and this braught the theory to some of the well known singularity problems .",
    "modern theory tries to pay more respect to the view that the point - like approximation does not work in principle in the set of microobjects satisfying the above planck s formula .",
    "in other words , the right theoretical notion for these objects should be that of _ extended continuous finite _ objects , or _",
    "finite field objects_. during the last 30 years physicists have been trying seriously to implement in theory the `` extended point of view '' on microobjects mainly through the string / brane theories , but the difficulties these theories meet , generated partly by the great purposes they set before themselves , still do not allow to get satisfactory results .",
    "of course , attempts to create extended point view on elementary particles different from the string / brane theory approach , have been made and are beeng made these days [ 3 ] .",
    "anyway , we have to admit now , that after one century away from the discovery of planck s formula , we still do not have a complete and satisfactory self - consistent theory of single photons .",
    "so , creation of a self - consistent extended point of view and working out a corresponding theory is still a challenge , and this paper aims to consider such an extended point of view on photons as _ screw solitons _ in the frame of the newly developed eed [ 4 ] .",
    "first we summurize the main features / properties of solitons and photons .",
    "the concept of soliton appears in physics as a nonlinear elaboration - physical and mathematical- of the general notion for exitation in a medium .",
    "it includes the following features : 0.4 cm i. physical . 0.4 cm 1 .",
    "the medium is homogeneous , isotropic and has definite properties of elasticity .",
    "the exitation does not destroy the medium . 0.3 cm 3 .",
    "the exitation is finite : 0.3 cm -at every moment it occupies comparetively small volume of the medium ,    -it carries finite quantities of energy - momentum and angular momentum , and of any other physical quantity too ,    -it may have translational - rotational ( may time - periodical ) dynamical structure , i.e. besides its straightline propagation as a whole it may have internal rotational degrees of freedom . 0.3 cm 4 . the exitation is time - stable , i.e. at lack of external perturbations its dynamical evolution does not lead to a self - ruin . in particular , the spatial shape of the exitation does not ( significantly ) change during its propagation . 0.3 cm the above 4 features outline the physical notion of a _",
    "solitary wave_. a solitary wave becomes a _ soliton _ if it has in adition the following property of stability : 0.3 cm 5 .",
    "the exitation survives when collides with another exitation of the same nature .",
    "0.3 cm we make some comments on the features 1 - 5 .",
    "feature 1 requires homogenity and some ealstic properties of the medium , which means that it is capable to bear the exitation , and every region of it , subject to the exitation , i.e. draged out of its natural ( equilibrium ) state , is capable to recover entirely after the exitation leaves that region .",
    "feature 2 puts limitations on the exitations considered in view of the medium properties : they should not destroy the medium .",
    "feature 3 is very important , since it requires _ finite _ nature of the exitations , it enables them to represent some initial level self - organized physical objects with dynamical structure , so that these objects `` feel good '' in this medium .",
    "this finite nature assumption admits only such exitations which may be _ created _ and _ destroyed _ ; no point like and/or infinite exitations are admitted .",
    "the exitation interacts permanently with the medium and the time periodicity available may be interpreted as a measure of this interaction .",
    "feature 4 guarantees the very existence of the exitation in this medium , and the shape keeping during propagation allows its recognition and identification when observed from outside .",
    "this feature 4 carries in some sense the first newton s principle from the mechanics of particles to the dynamics of continuous finite objects , it implies conservation of energy - momentum and of the other characteristic quantities of the exitation .",
    "the last feature 5 is frequently not taken in view , especially when one considers single exitations .",
    "but in presence of many exitations in a given region it allows only such kind of interaction between / among the exitations , which does not destroy them , so that the exitations get out of the interaction ( almost ) the same .",
    "this feature is some continuous version of the elastic collisions of particles .",
    "0.4 cm ii .",
    "mathematical 0.4 cm 1 .",
    "the exitation defining functions @xmath11 are components of _ one _ mathematical object ( usually a section of a vector / tensor bundle ) and depend on @xmath12 spatial and @xmath13 time coordinates . 0.3 cm 2 .",
    "the components @xmath11 satisfy some system of nonlinear partial differential equations ( except the case of ( 1 + 1 ) linear wave equation ) , and admit some `` running wave '' dynamics as a whole , together with available internal dynamics . 0.3 cm 3 .",
    "there are ( infinite ) many conservation laws",
    ". 0.3 cm 4 .",
    "the components @xmath11 are localized ( or finite ) functions with respect to the spatial coordinates , and the conservative quantities are finite . 0.3 cm 5 .",
    "the multisoliton solutions , describing elastic interaction ( collision ) , tend to many single soliton solutions at @xmath14 .",
    "0.4 cm comments : 0.3 cm 1 .",
    "feature 1 introduces some notion of _ integrity _ : _ one exitation - one mathematical object _ , although having many algebraically independant but differentially interrelated ( through the equations ) components @xmath11 . 0.3 cm 2 .",
    "usually , the system of pde is of _ evolution _ kind , so that the exitation is modelled as a dynamical system : the initial configuration determines fully the evolution .",
    "the `` running wave '' dynamics as a whole introduces galileo / lorentz invariance and corresponds to the physical feature 4 .",
    "the nonlinearity of the equations is meant to guarantee the spatially localized ( finite ) nature of the solutions",
    ". 0.3 cm 3 .",
    "the infinite many consrvation laws frequently lead to complete integrability of the equations",
    ". the spatially localized nature of @xmath11 represents the finite nature of the exitation",
    ". 0.3 cm 5 .",
    "the many single soliton asymptotics at @xmath15 of a multisoliton solution mathematically represents the elastic character of the interactions admitted , and so it takes care of the stability of the physical objects beeing modelled .",
    "0.4 cm the above physical / mathematical features are not always strictly accounted for in the literature .",
    "for example , the word _",
    "soliton _ is frequently used for a _ solitary wave _ exitation .",
    "another example is the usage of the word soliton just when the energy density , being usually a quadratic function of the corresponding @xmath11 , has the above soliton properties [ 5 ] .",
    "also , one usually meets this soliton terminology for spatially _ localized _ , i.e. going to zero at spatial infinity , but _ not _ spatially _ finite _ @xmath11 , i.e. when the spatial support of @xmath11 is a compact set .",
    "in fact , all soliton solutions of the well known kdv , sg , nls equations are localized and _ not _ finite . it is curious , that the _ linear _ ( 1 + 1 ) wave equation has spatially finite soliton solutions of arbitarary shape .    further in this paper we shall present 1-soliton screw solutions of the vacuum eed equations , so we may , and shall , use the more attractive word soliton for solitary wave .",
    "we hope this will not bring any troubles to the reader .",
    "the screw soliton solutions we are going to present are of photon - like character , i.e. the velocity of their translational component of propagation is equal to the velocity of light @xmath16 , and besides of the energy - momentum , they carry also internal angular ( spin , helicity ) momentum accounting for the available rotational component of propagation",
    ". therefore , this seems to be the proper place to recall some of the well known properties of _",
    "photons_.    first of all , as it was explained in the introduction , photons should not be considered as point - like objects since they respect the planck s relation @xmath3 and carry internal ( spin ) momentum , so they have to be considered as extended finite objects with periodical rotational - translational dynamical sructure .",
    "we assume that the concept of soliton , as described above , may serve as a good mathematical tool in trying to represent mathematically the real photons , so that , their well known integral properties to appear as determined by their dynamical structure .    we give now some of the more important for our purposes properties of photons . 0.3 cm 1 .",
    "photons have zero proper mass and electric charge .",
    "the ( straightline ) translational component of their propagation velocity is constant and equal to the experimentally established velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "photons are time - stable objects .",
    "every interaction with other objects kills them .",
    "the existence of photons is generically connected with some time - periodical process of period @xmath17 and frequency @xmath18 , so that the planck relation @xmath3 , or @xmath4 , where @xmath19 is the planck constant , holds . 0.3 cm 4 .",
    "every single photon carries momentum @xmath6 with @xmath20 and spin momentum equal to the planck constant @xmath19 .",
    "photons are polarized objects . the polarization of every single photon is determined through the relation between the translational and rotational directions of propagation , hence , the 3-dimensionality of the real space allows just two polarizations .",
    "we call the polarization _",
    "right _ , if when looking along its translational component of propagation , i.e. from befind , we find its rotational component of propagation to be _ clock - wise _ , and the polarization is _ left _ when under the same conditions we find _ anti - clock - wise _ rotational component of propagation",
    ". 0.3 cm 6 .",
    "photons do not interact with each other .",
    "i.e. they pass through each other without changes .",
    "0.4 cm these well known properties of photons would hardly need any comments .",
    "however , according to our oppinion , these properties strongly suggest to make use of the soliton concept for working out a mathematical model of their structure and propagation . and",
    "this was one of the main reasons to develop the extension of faraday - maxwell theory to what we call now extended electrodynamics ( eed ) .",
    "we proceed now to recall the basics of eed , in the frame of which the screw soliton model of photons will be worked out .",
    "we are going to consider just the vacuum case of eed in relativistic formulation .",
    "the signiture of the space time pseudometric @xmath21 is @xmath22 , the canonical coordinates will be denoted by @xmath23 , so the components @xmath24 in any canonical coordinate system are @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding volume 4-form @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 since @xmath30 .",
    "the hodge @xmath31-operator is defined by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 and @xmath36 forms respectively . in terms of @xmath37",
    "we have @xmath38 .",
    "we have also the exterior derivative @xmath39 and the coderivative @xmath40 .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath41 are : @xmath42 , are the components @xmath43 of the electric vector @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the components @xmath46 of the magnetic vector @xmath47 , respectively .    in terms of @xmath48",
    "the vacuum maxwell equations are given by @xmath49 in eed the above equations ( 1 ) are extended to @xmath50 in components , equations ( 2 ) are respectively : @xmath51 the maxwell energy - momentum tensor @xmath52\\ ] ] is assumed as energy - momentum tensor in eed because its divergence @xmath53\\ ] ] is obviously zero on the solutions of equations ( 3 ) and no problems of maxwell theory at this point are known .",
    "the physical sense of equations ( 3 ) is , obviously , local energy - momentum redistribution during the time - evolution : the first two equations say that @xmath0 and @xmath1 keep locally their energy - mimentum , and the third equation says ( in correspondence with the first two ) , that the energy - momentum transferred from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is always equal locally to the energy - momentum transferred from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , hence , any of the two expressions @xmath54 and @xmath55 may be considered as a measure of the rotational component of the energy - momentum redistribution between @xmath0 and @xmath1 during propagation ( recall that the spatial part of @xmath56 is @xmath57 and the spatial part of @xmath58 is @xmath59 ) .    obviously , all solutions of ( 1 ) are solutions to ( 3 ) , but equations ( 3 ) have more solutions . in particular , those solutions of ( 3 ) which satisfy the relations @xmath60 are called _",
    "nonlinear_. further we are going to consider only the nonlinear solutions of ( 3 ) .",
    "some of the basic results in our previous studies of the nonlinear solutions of equations ( 3 ) could be summarized in the following way : for every nonlinear solution @xmath61 of ( 3 ) there exists a canonical system of coordinates @xmath62 in which the solution is fully represented by two functions @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , as follows : @xmath66 @xmath67 we call @xmath68 the _ amplitude _ function and @xmath69 the _ phase _ function of the solution",
    ". the condition @xmath70 allows to set @xmath71 , and further we are going to work with @xmath72 , and @xmath72 will be called _",
    "phase_. as we showed [ 4 ] , the two functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 may be introduced in a coordinate free manner , so they have well defined invariant sense .",
    "every nonlinear solution satisfies the following important relations : @xmath73 we recall also the _ scale factor _ @xmath74 , defined by the relation @xmath75 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that it depends only on the derivatives of @xmath72 in these coordinates and is given by @xmath76",
    "note that eed considers the field as having two components : @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as we mentioned earlier ,",
    "the third equation of ( 3 ) describes how much energy - momentum is redistributed locally with time between the two components @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the field : @xmath77 gives the transfer from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and @xmath78 gives the transfer from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , thus , if there is such an energy - momentum exchange equations ( 3 ) require permanent and equal mutual energy - momentum transfers between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are always orthogonal to each other and these two mutual transfers depend on the derivatives of the field functions through @xmath56 and @xmath79 ( i.e. through @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which are not equal to zero in general ) , we may interpret this property of the solution as a description of an _ internal rotation - like _ component of the general dynamics of the field .",
    "hence , any of the two expressions @xmath82 or @xmath78 , having the sense of local energy - momentum change , may serve as a natural measure of this rotational component of the energy - momentum redistribution during the propagation . therefore ,",
    "after some appropriate normalization , we may interpret any of the two 3-forms @xmath83 and @xmath84 as local _ spin - momentum _ of the solution .",
    "making use of the above expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 we compute @xmath85 : @xmath86 since @xmath87 , this expression says that we shall have nonzero local spin - momentum only if @xmath72 is _ not _ a running wave along @xmath88 . the above idea to consider the 3-form @xmath84 as a measure of the spin momentum of the solution suggests also some additional equation for @xmath72 ,",
    "because the spin momentum is a conserved quantity and its integral over the 3-space should not depend on the time variable @xmath89 .",
    "this requires to have some nontrivial _",
    "closed 3-form _ on @xmath90 , such that when restricted to the 3-space and ( spatially ) integrated to give the integral spin momentum of the solution",
    ". therefore we assume the additional equation @xmath91 in our system of coordinates this equation is reduced to @xmath92 i.e. @xmath93 equation ( 10 ) has the following solutions :    1@xmath94 . running wave solutions @xmath95 ,    2@xmath94 .",

    "the running wave solutions @xmath101 , defined by @xmath102 lead to @xmath103 and to @xmath104 , and by this reason they have to be ignored .",
    "the solutions @xmath105 and @xmath106 , defined respectively by 2@xmath107 and 3@xmath107 , give the same scale factor @xmath108 .",
    "since at all spatial points where the field is different from zero we have @xmath109 , we may choose @xmath110 , so we obtain the following _ nonrunning _ wave solutions of ( 10 ) : @xmath111 where @xmath112 accounts for the two different polarizations .",
    "clearly , the physical dimension of @xmath113 is _ length _ ,",
    "@xmath100 is dimensionless and the _ scale _ factor is @xmath114 .",

    "therefore , at all points of the 3-region @xmath122 , occupied by the solution at @xmath119 , under the additional conditions @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the directions of the representatives of @xmath115 at all spatial points will be the same , independently on the spatial shape of the 3-region @xmath122 . at every subsequent moment",

    "hence , the solution in terms of ( @xmath168 ) in this sytem of coordinates will look like ( we assume @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , @xmath171 and we write just @xmath172 for @xmath100 ) .",

    "we choose the coordinates @xmath176 as usual : @xmath177 grows rightwards , @xmath178 grows upwards , and then @xmath88 is determined by the requirement to have a right orientation .",

    "when @xmath88 grows from @xmath183 to @xmath184 the magnetic vector @xmath116 on this screw line ( which is the central screw line of the screw cylinder ) turns around the axis @xmath88 and stays always directed to it , while the electric vector @xmath115 rotates around the @xmath88-axis and it is always tangent to this rotation ; at the same time the poynting vector keeps its @xmath182-orientation .",
    "this situation corresponds to the clockwise polarizarion ( looking from behind ) .",
    "if @xmath126 then the electric vector @xmath115 stays always directed to the @xmath88-axis and since we have chosen @xmath170 , i.e. the solution propagates along @xmath182 , the magnetic vector @xmath116 rotates around the @xmath88-axis anticlockwise ( looking from behind ) and is always tangent to this rotation .",
    "so , this corresponds to the anticlockwise polarization .",
    "we note once again that any actual assumption @xmath124 would make the representatives of the magnetic vector ( when @xmath127 ) @xmath116 parallel to each other at every point of the plane @xmath185 at @xmath165 .",
    "this may cause some instabilites with time , so in order to have all representatives of @xmath116 ( or @xmath115 in the other polarization ) at every point of that plane to be directed to the @xmath186axis and not to be paralel to each other , we may use @xmath100 for the necessary corrections .",
    "this remark shows the importance of the relation @xmath187 , @xmath100 must be equal to the angle between the two lines passing through the points @xmath188 $ ] and @xmath189 $ ] , where @xmath143 .",
    "now , every point @xmath190 inside the solution region follows its own screw line so , that the distance @xmath191 between this screw line and the @xmath88-axis is kept the same when @xmath88 grows .",
    "since the spatial periodicity along @xmath88 is equal to @xmath184 , ( note that @xmath161 is in fact the maximum value of @xmath113 ) , we obtain an interpretation of the scale factor @xmath192 as the distance between the screw line inside @xmath138 along which @xmath192 and the @xmath88-axis .",
    "this , in particular , means that for @xmath193 , i.e. for a very thin screw cylinder , the scale factor @xmath114 is approximated by @xmath194 ; it also follows that the relation between the longitudinal ant transverse sizes of the solution is approximately equal to @xmath2 .",
    "we turn now to the integral spin - momentum ( helicity ) computation . according to our assumption",
    "its density is given by any of the correspondingly normalized two 3-forms @xmath84 , or @xmath83 . in order to have the appropriate physical dimension we consider now the 3-form @xmath34 defined by @xmath195.\\ ] ]",
    "its physical dimension is `` energy - density @xmath196 time '' . since @xmath197 at most , and in view of ( 8)",
    ", we see that @xmath34 is closed : @xmath198 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath34 to @xmath199 ( which will be denoted also by @xmath34 ) is also closed : @xmath200=0,\\ ] ] and we may use the stokes theorem .",
    "we shall make use of the solutions @xmath201 of equation ( 10 ) .",
    "we have @xmath202 , @xmath203 , so , in view of our approximating assumption @xmath192 , we integrate @xmath204 over the 3-space and obtain @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the integral energy of the solution , @xmath207 is the intrinsically defined time - period , and @xmath112 accounts for the two polarizations . according to our interpretation",
    "this is the integral intrinsic angular momentum , or spin - momentum , of the solution , for one period @xmath17 .",
    "this intrinsically defined action @xmath208 of the solution is to be identified with the planck s constant @xmath19 , @xmath209 , or @xmath3 , if we are going to interpret the solution as an extended model of a single photon .",
    "0.3 cm * remark*. for the connection of @xmath84 with our earlier definition of the local intrinsic spin - momentum through the nijenhuis torsion tensor of @xmath210 one may look in our paper , cited as the last one in [ 5 ] .",
    "according to our view , based on the conservation properties of the energy - momentum and spin - momentum , photons are real objects and not theoretical imagination .",
    "this view on these microobjects as _ real extended _ objects , obeying the famous planck relation @xmath3 , almost necessarily brings us to favor the soliton concept as the most appropriate and self - consistent working theoretical tool for now , because _ no point - like conception is consistent with the availability of frequency and spin - momentum of photons , as well as with the possibility photons to be destroyed_. so , the dynamical structure of photons is a real thing , clearly manifesting itself through a consistent rotational - translational propagation in space , and their finite nature reveals itself through the finite 3-volumes of definite shape they occupy at every moment of their existence , and through the finite values of the universal conserved quantities they carry .",
    "the dynamical point of view on these objects reflects theoretically in the possibility to make use of , more or less , _ arbitrary _ initial configurations , i.e. to consider them as dynamical systems .",
    "this important moment allows the localizing functions @xmath211 from differential topology to be used for making the spatial dimensions of the solution finite , and not smoothly vanishing just at infinity as is the case of the usual soliton solutions .",
    "our theoretical screw example , presenting an exact solution of the nonlinear vacuum eed equations , was meant to present a , more or less , _ visual image _ of the well known properties of photons , of their translational - rotational dynamical structure , and , especially , of the nature of their spin - momentum . of course",
    ", we do not insist on the function @xmath212 chosen , any other localisable inside the circle @xmath149 function would do the same job in this theoretical example .",
    "so far we have not experimental data concerning the shape of single photons , and we do not exclude various ones , so our choices for the amplitude @xmath68 and for the scale factor @xmath213 are rather admissible approximations than correct mathematical images .",
    "the more important moment was to recognize the dynamical sense of the quantity @xmath214 , and to find that the spin - momentum conservation equation @xmath215 gives solutions for the phase function @xmath216 , which helps very much to visualize the dinamical properties of photons in our aproach .",
    "so , we are able to obtain a general expression for the integral spin - momentum , which , in fact , is the planck s formula @xmath209 .",
    "moreover , the whole solution @xmath61 describes naturally the polarization properties of photons , it clearly differs the clockwise and anticlockwise polarizations through pointing out the different roles of @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the two cases .",
    "an important moment in our approach is that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are considered as two components of the same solution , so the couples @xmath125 and @xmath217 give together the 3-dimensional picture of _ one _ solution .",
    "this , of course , would require the full energy - momentum tensor @xmath218 , to be two times the usual @xmath219 , given by ( 4 ) : @xmath220 .",
    "finally , we d like to mention that , making use of the localizing functions @xmath221 , we may choose an amplitude function @xmath68 of a `` many - lump '' kind , i.e. at every moment @xmath68 to be different from zero inside many non - overlaping 3-regions , probably of the same shape , so we are able to describe a flow of consistently propagating photon - like exitations of the same polarization and of the same phase",
