    "the sky contains a variety of objects , for example pulsars @xcite and quasars @xcite , that produce extravagantly energetic signals such as collimated jets of electromagnetic radiation . in many cases ,",

    "energy extraction from such a black hole is widely believed to be described by the highly nonlinear equations of force - free electromagnetism @xcite . as our ability to observe these systems improves , a better quantitative and qualitative understanding of these interesting nonlinear equations is required .",

    "energy extraction is possible only for rotating kerr black holes , and the greater the rotation , the easier it becomes .",
    "moreover it is a process that occurs near the black hole horizon , and is largely insensitive to the physics at spatial infinity .",
    "this suggests that much of the physics of force - free electrodynamic energy extraction can be captured by studying the near horizon region of maximally - rotating extreme kerr black holes , such as the one in cygnus x-1 @xcite .",
    "fortuitously , the dynamics of this region  known as nhek for near horizon extreme kerr  is governed by an enhanced conformal symmetry which does not extend to the full kerr geometry @xcite .",
    "this symmetry motivated the kerr / cft conjecture pertaining to the quantum structure of black holes @xcite and also has potential consequences for observational astronomy @xcite . in this paper , it enables us to find large families of exact axisymmetric non - null ( @xmath2 ) solutions of the equations of force - free electrodynamics , exhibiting a variety of complex behaviors .",
    "these axisymmetric solutions do not extract angular momentum , which precludes energy extraction .",
    "the more general case will be analyzed in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",

    "for the special case of the event horizon at @xmath85 , where @xmath97 diverges ( since @xmath239 ) , we must instead define the energy and angular momentum flux densities threading the black hole , denoted by @xmath240 and @xmath241 respectively , by @xmath242 the factor of @xmath243 introduced here compensates for the one in the definition of @xmath74 .",
