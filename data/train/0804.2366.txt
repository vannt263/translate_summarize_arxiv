    "95% of all stars end their lives as white dwarfs .",
    "about 20% of the hot post - agb stars are h deficient .",
    "most of these are the result of a ( very ) late he - shell flash , but the evolutionary status of a fraction of about @xmath0% of the hottest h - deficient stars , namely the o(he ) stars @xcite , is as yet unexplained .",
    "o(he ) stars form a small group of four extremely hot post - agb stars which exhibit absorption - line spectra dominated by heii . for a detailed introduction see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( v)ltp evolutionary models can explain the observed he / c / o abundances in wolf - rayet and pg1159 stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they have never reproduced he - dominated surface abundances .",
    "recently , miller bertolami & althaus ( 2006 ) presented a `` numerical test '' where they increased the mass - loss rate of a ltp star artificially in order to `` blow away '' the h from the stellar surface .",
    "however , this is in contradiction with radiation - driven wind theory @xcite and , if at all , valid for low - mass o(he ) stars only ( see below ) .    as an alternative , a third post - agb",
    "evolutionary sequence might exist and the o(he ) stars could be the successors of the rcrb stars which are relatively cool ( @xmath1 around 10000k ) stars with he - dominated atmospheres , too . if this is true , we can expect similar metal abundances . in order to investigate on these in o(he ) stars , we have performed fuv observations of all four objects with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) .",
    "previous spectral analyses of o(he ) stars were based on optical , uv ( international ultraviolet explorer , iue ) , and x - ray ( rosat ) observations @xcite . the photospheric parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : php ] .    [",
    "tab : php ]    lcr@.lr@.lr@.lr@.lr@.l & & & & & & + & & & + lotr4 & 120 & 5&5 & 0&5 & 0&004 & 0&001 & 0&008 + hs1522 + 6615 & 140 & 5&5 & 0&1 & 0&003 & + hs2209 + 8229 & 100 & 6&0 & 0&2 & + k1 - 27 & 105 &  6&5 & 0&2 & 0&005 & 0&005 & + majority rcrb & & & 0&0001 & 0&010 & 0&004 & 0&005 + v854 cen & & & 0&5 & 0&030 & 0&0003 & 0&003 +    since high - resolution and high - s / n uv spectra are a prerequisite for a reliable determination of metal abundances in hot stars , we have applied for observations with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis )",
    ". we were awarded observational time in cycle 13 .",
    "unfortunately , stis encountered a failure during that cycle on aug 4 , 2004 while our first observations were scheduled on aug 9 .    a fuse campaign in 2002 ( cycle 3 , program c178 , exposure time about 40ksec ) was more successful .",
    "for the analysis of the obtained fuv spectra we used tmap , the tbingen nlte model - atmosphere package @xcite , and calculated fully - line blanketed models in order to identify weak photospheric lines . in the course of this analysis",
    ", it turned out that the spectra are strongly contaminated by interstellar absorption and the s / n was not sufficient for our purpose .",
    "the mass - loss rates could be determined from the ovi @xmath21031.9 , 1037.6  resonance doublet @xcite and appear in agreement with radiation - driven wind theory .",
    "one o(he ) star ( hs1522 + 6615 ) was included in a re - observation campaign ( cycle 7 , program u103 , exposure time about 4ksec ) and our own re - observation proposal ( cycle 8 , program h024 , 204ksec in order to improve the s / n ) was accepted .",
    "these observations were scheduled for summer 2007  the fuse failure on july 12 , 2007 prevented them .",
    "thus , at the moment , we can not determine the photospheric metal abundances of the o(he ) stars reliably .",
    "the group of four known o(he ) stars divides into two sub - groups , two high - mass ( @xmath3 , the central star ( cs ) of the planetary nebula ( pn ) lotr4 and hs1522 + 6615 ) and two low - mass ( @xmath4 , cspn of k1@xmath527 and hs2209 + 8829 ) members .",
    "its is possible that different evolutionary scenarios are valid for each group .",
    "the low - mass o(he ) stars may be so - called post early - agb stars , i.e. they experienced the first thermal pulse ( tp ) after their departure from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "@xcite calculated an evolutionary track for a @xmath6 post early - agb star which closely matches the positions of the cspn of k1@xmath527 and of hs2209 + 822 in the @xmath7 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teffg ] ) . due to an artificially increased mass - loss rate ( ten times higher than predicted by radiation - driven wind theory )",
    ", a strong h deficiency is achieved .",
    "spectral analysis of the fuse spectra has shown that the mass - loss rates of o(he ) stars are not higher than predicted by radiation - driven wind theory @xcite and therefore , any change of the surface composition due to a stellar wind is unlikely . moreover , for the h abundance in these o(he ) stars , presently only upper limits are known ( tab .  [",
    "tab : php ] ) .",
    "therefore a further , detailed investigation on a distinct `` sdo(he ) @xmath8 o(he ) @xmath8 do white dwarf '' evolutionary channel ( cf .",
    "* ) is necessary .",
    "however , it is worth to note that the do - type cspn pg1034 + 001 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : teffg ] ) may be a descendant from low - mass o(he ) or pg1159 stars .",
    "the high - mass o(he ) stars appear to follow the `` normal '' born - again scenario @xcite where a ( very ) late tp causes the h - deficiency .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to note that both known objects , the cspn of lotr4 as well as hs1522 + 6615 , show remaining h in their spectra ( tab .  [",
    "tab : php ] ) .",
    "since their surface gravity @xmath9 is relatively low , gravitational settling during their following evolution might turn them into h - rich ( da ) white dwarfs .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether the extremely hot do white dwarf kpd0005 + 5106 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teffg ] , cf .",
    "werner et al .",
    "these proceedings ) is a successor of high - mass o(he ) stars .",
    "an alternative o(he ) scenario is that of double - degenerate mergers .",
    "similar h / he surface compositions suggest that o(he ) stars are the progeny of rcrb stars @xcite and they follow a `` rcrb @xmath8 o(he ) @xmath8 do white dwarf '' sequence .",
    "available fuse spectra of o(he ) stars do not show isolated metal lines and thus , allow to give upper limits for metal abundances only .",
