    "it will be shown that this alteration depend both on the energy and the type of the ion .",
    "\\(b ) the spectral index of any ion released at the sources in the disc volume is constant in the energy interval @xmath36-@xmath2 ev .",
    "the plausibility of this fundamental hypothesis is rooted on the measurements of the spectral indices collected in more than half a century by balloon and satellite detectors ( see fig . 4 , 5 and 6 ) .",

    "though the present calculation ignores the mechanism that accelerate cosmic rays in the milky way , two constraints have to be obeyed by the accelerator , whatever it might be , in the range @xmath36-@xmath2 ev : ( 1 ) spectral indices generated at the sources placed in the disc volume are independent of energy ; ( 2 ) the cosmic - ray sources are uniformly distributed in the disc volume at any energy @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated by full simulation of cosmic - ray motion that the displacement of the cosmic rays from the sources to any point in the galaxy has a modest effect on the spectral indices released at the sources .",
    "for example , the propagation of helium in the disc entails an index modification of 0.04 in the energy band @xmath32-@xmath51 ev being at the sources 2.65 . while for most calculations",

    "the theory predicts the exact position where the ankle is observed , at @xmath55 ev and that of the knee as well , and many other features .",
    "the quantitative characteristics of the ankle of the @xmath53 @xmath54 derive from those of the ankles of the individual ions .",
    "the proton ankle is at the lowest energy while the iron ankle is at the maximum energy , which turns out to be @xmath2 ev .",
    "the theory distinguishes an ankle in the grammage versus energy and an ankle in the cosmic - ray intensity versus energy .",
    "the knees are intimately related by the theory to the ankles of any ions , and since there exist an excellent quantitative agreement with numerous experimental data , the maximum energy involved in the knee - ankle relationship is the fe ankle energy .",
    "the fe ankle energy in the grammage is at @xmath2 ev , and as a consequence , it delimits the range of application of this theory . above the energy of @xmath2 ev the results reported in this paper and the companion one @xcite have to be regarded as numerical exercises .",
    "in fact , physical phenomena having empirical evidence operate above @xmath2 ev but they are not incorporated in the @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath52 as it is presently formulated .",
    "the results of the calculations depend on the geographic site of the sources generating the extradisc component .",
    "for instance , if the sources of the extradisc component would be the ensemble of the spiral galaxies , due to the similarity of the milky way galaxy , only minor modifications of the calculations would be necessary to determine @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "if the sources of the extradisc cosmic rays would be placed in the local superclaster of galaxies , the present calculations are not sufficiently precise for a number of reasons . if the extradisc component are just reentrant particles escaped from the disc of the milky way , as already suggested @xcite , the calculations are exact .",

    "let us preliminarily notice that the interpolation of the energy spectra of individual ions with a constant spectral index in a restricted energy band it is an established tradition at energies below @xmath10 ev .",
    "an index slightly depending on energy would probably conform better to some data , in some energy intervals .",
    "this refinement , however , it is still uncommon , and unnecessary in the present work , and consequently omitted here .",
    "the fundamental hypothesis of the present calculation incorporated in the @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 is that all ions at the sources have constant spectral indices .",
    "this simple hypothesis predominantly concurs in the prediction of the @xmath53 @xmath54 leading to the excellent agreement with experimental data as shown , for example , in figure 1 .",
    "figure 4 reports the energy spectra of 11 different ions in the interval @xmath57-@xmath10 ev .",
    "the spectra form a grid of parallel straight lines in the flux units shown .",
    "@xmath58 @xmath59 the regular forms of these spectra with no dips and no spikes justify the postulate of @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 . though the evidence for constant indices is solid and irrefutable below @xmath60 ev there",
    "exist in @xmath61 magnificent and universal phenomena that modify indices released at the sources .",
    "the ensemble of the processes referred to as solar modulation occurring in all stars is an example of violation of the @xmath48 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath62 @xmath30 at low energy .",
    "thus , local phenomena evidently violates the postulate . in order to ascertain",
    "if additional local phenomena in the galaxy , besides solar modulation and the knees , in the interval @xmath36-@xmath2 ev alter the indices , a careful examination of the experimental data is mandatory .",
    "a compilation of indices of a number of nuclides from hydrogen to nickel is shown in figure 5 . this compilation based on measurements of the indices mainly between @xmath57-@xmath10 ev",
    "is referred to as wiebel - sooth compilation @xcite and the corresponding parameters incorporated in the theory are called @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 ( low energy ) . another compilation of spectral indices collecting measurements at higher energies @xcite between @xmath32-@xmath10 ev is also shown in the same figure 5 ( blue open dots)and it is referred to as @xmath66 @xmath64 @xmath65 ( high energy ) .",
    "the spectral indices shown in figure 5 accumulate around a common value of 2.65 between @xmath36-@xmath10 ev .",
    "it is also evident from the experimental data on the indices shown in figure 5 ( red dots ) that higher the atomic mass harder the index .",
    "this correlation between indices and atomic mass is more pronounced for @xmath44 than @xmath67 ion blend .",
    "notice that the parameters of the wiebel - sooth compilation incorporated in the @xmath44 ion blend based on the interval @xmath68@xmath69(@xmath70 ) up to @xmath32 ev are three orders of magnitudes from the knee energy region ( e.g. @xmath10-@xmath71 ev ) while those of the @xmath45 ion blend are closer .",
    "if the postulate of the constant spectral indices is exactly described by a straight line ( in logarithmic scales of intensity and energy ) either the @xmath44 or @xmath45 blend would suffice to correctly calculate the chemical composition . in this circumstance",
    "the differences in the chemical composition at any energy are only due to the ion abundances at the normalization energy of the theory .",
    "if quite small violations of the postulate take place , then , the differences originating from the two ion blends become significant .",
    "recent experimental data between 40 and 400 @xmath70 indicates that the proton index changes from 2.77 @xmath72 0.02 to 2.67 @xmath72 0.03 in the interval @xmath73@xmath74 ev taking into account the data of atic2 @xcite and cream experiments @xcite .",
    "the hardening of the index seems to affect the helium spectrum as well .",
    "in fact , the index of 2.70 @xmath72 0.02 measured at low energy below @xmath75 @xmath70 decreases to the value of 2.62 @xmath72 0.05 above @xmath75 @xmath70 up to the maximum energy explored to day of @xmath76 ev @xcite .",
    "the alteration of the h and he indices in the preknee energy region would entail a change in the h / he flux ratio which has been proved to be constant at low energy , @xmath77 ev @xcite .",
    "the h / he flux ratio versus energy has been examined in another paper @xcite where it has been shown that the problem of the h / he flux ratio above @xmath77 ev , is , at the present times , inextricable .",
    "the recent data of the cream experiment @xcite do not resolve the problem of the h / he flux ratio below @xmath10 ev due to the large error bars of the experiment at high energy , in the decade @xmath51-@xmath10 ev .",

    "the @xmath67 blend is a variant of the @xmath45 blend where the dominant nuclei , e.g. protons and helium , h and he have the classical value of 2.74 @xcite and 2.72 @xcite believed for many years to be standard , reliable measurements .",

    "the slight increase in the ( ca+fe ) fraction in the interval @xmath32-@xmath109 ev for the @xmath67 blend is caused by the tiny difference in the ca and fe slopes ( 2.66 for fe and 2.650 for ca , see table 2 ) with respect to the light ion slopes ( 2.74 for h and 2.72 for he ) .",
    "the strong increase of the ( ca+fe ) fraction between @xmath109 ev and @xmath110 ev is due not only to the difference in the indices(2.70 light ions against 2.60 heavy ions ) but predominantly to the high fall of the light ion flux ( light ion knees ) above the nominal knee of the complete spectrum at @xmath111 ev .",
