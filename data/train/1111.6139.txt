    "john nuttall , whose name appears in the title along with such distinguished , actually illustrious , colleagues , initiated the study of convergence of pad approximants for multivalued analytic functions on the plane . obviously , he was not the first to consider this problem ; the best known result in this sense is a theorem of markov ( or markoff ) @xcite , see also @xcite , which assures the _ locally uniform _ convergence of diagonal pad approximants to markov functions : if @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a positive measure compactly supported on @xmath2 with an infinite number of points of increase , then the diagonal pad approximants @xmath3_{\\widehat \\sigma}$ ] ( see the definition in section [ sec : statement ] ) to @xmath4 , which coincide with the approximants of the chebyshev or @xmath5-continued fraction for this function , converge to @xmath4 uniformly on compact subsets of the complement to the convex hull of the support of @xmath1 , and the convergence holds with a geometric rate",
    ". this theorem applies in particular to functions as @xmath6 in the same vein , dumas @xcite studied the case of the function of the form @xmath7 with points @xmath8 in general position and the branch of the square root selected in such a way that @xmath9 is bounded at infinity .",
    "dumas observed that the poles of the pad approximants to @xmath9 can be dense in @xmath10 .",
    "however , nuttall was the first to abandon the real line completely and start a convergence theory in a truly complex situation . from the dumas work it was clear that in a general situation we can no longer expect uniform convergence .",
    "the appropriate notion is the convergence _ in capacity _",
    "@xcite , that was developed independently by gonchar and nuttall .",
    "this is an analogue of convergence in measure , where the lebesgue or plane measure is replaced by the logarithmic capacity of the set .",
    "still , the question about the domain of convergence ( even in capacity ) remained : if the approximated function @xmath9 has a multi - valued analytic continuation to @xmath10 except for a finite number of branch points , then the single - valued pad approximants @xmath3_f$ ] can not converge to @xmath9 in this whole domain .",
    "they must `` choose '' the appropriate region of convergence where @xmath9 is single - valued too , and the boundary of this region should attract a sufficient number of poles of @xmath3_f$ ] .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in @xcite nuttall generalized markov s theorem by considering a class of hyperelliptic functions of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a polynomial of even degree and simple poles , and @xmath13 are holomorphic functions",
    "( it was extended later to meromorphic functions in the work of stahl @xcite and suetin @xcite ) . for these functions he found the domain where the convergence takes place",
    ": it is a complement to a system of arcs determined by the location of the branch points .",
    "nuttall characterized this set as having a minimal logarithmic capacity among all other systems of cuts making the approximated function single - valued in their complement ( see e.g.  figure  [ fig : polespade ] ) . in @xcite nuttall",
    "conjectured also that this result is valid for any analytic function on @xmath10 with a finite number of branch points .",
    "the complete proof of this conjecture was given , even in a greater generality , by h.  stahl in a series of papers @xcite , under the only assumption that the singularities of the function @xmath9 form a _",
    "polar set _ , i.e.  a set of logarithmic capacity zero , see theorem [ thm : stahl ] below .",
    "stahl also characterized the analytic arcs forming the boundary of this domain as trajectories of a rational quadratic differential with poles at the singularities of @xmath9 .",
    "they are also a case of the so - called boutroux curves , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the general results of nuttall and stahl ( and also of gonchar and rakhmanov @xcite ) deal essentially with convergence in capacity and weak ( equivalently , @xmath14-th root ) asymptotics of the denominators and residues of the pad approximants .",
    "however , strong or szeg - type asymptotics is extremely interesting , at least in order to clarify the behavior of the spurious poles .",
    "as it was mentioned , poles that appear within the domain of convergence in capacity and that receive the name ( coined by g.  baker in the 1960s ) of _ spurious _ , _ floating _ or _ wandering _ poles @xcite , can become the main obstacle for the uniform convergence .",
    "for some classes of elliptic and hyperelliptic functions @xcite , the dynamics of the spurious poles is completely determined by the properties of the riemann surface underlying the approximated function . moreover , in the elliptic case @xcite there is only one wandering pole , which greatly simplifies the description of the asymptotic behavior of the pad approximants .",
    "the results in @xcite were obtained when the approximated functions could be represented as cauchy integrals supported on the critical trajectory of certain quadratic differential with four poles when this trajectory consists of two disconnected components ; the analogue for the chebotarev set was treated in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the strong asymptotics of the pad denominators and the residues of the pad approximants for a canonical class of algebraic functions  a generalization of the jacobi weight on @xmath15 $ ] , revisiting and extending the results of j.  nuttall in @xcite .",
    "we look at this problems from two different perspectives , which give us two formally distinct answers .",
    "one of the main goals is to understand the relation between these two asymptotic expressions , in order to get new insight into the nature of this problem and the methods we have used .    at the final stage of the preparation of this manuscript we learned about the closely related work @xcite where the authors also apply one of the techniques used by us to the asymptotic analysis of the pad denominators in a slightly more general situation .",
    "our works , although close in spirit , have a number of substantial differences , and thus are rather complementary than overlapping .",
    "let @xmath16 , @xmath17 , be distinct and in general , non - collinear points on the complex plane @xmath10 , @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the set of functions @xmath9 holomorphic at infinity and such that @xmath9 can be continued analytically ( as a multivalued function ) to the whole @xmath20 .",
    "a _ diagonal pad approximant _ to @xmath21 is a rational function @xmath22_f = p_n / q_n$ ] of type @xmath23 , that is , such that both @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 denotes the class of algebraic polynomials of degree @xmath26 ) , which has a maximal order of contact with @xmath9 at infinity : @xmath27 this condition may be impossible to satisfy , but following frobenius , we can obtain the coefficients of @xmath28 and @xmath29 as a solution to the linear system @xmath30 equations form an undetermined homogeneous linear system .",
    "although the solution of is not unique , the pad approximant ( rational function ) @xmath31 is .",
    "hereafter , @xmath32 will always stand for the unique pair of relatively prime polynomials determining @xmath33 , and @xmath29 is taken monic .",
    "the degree of @xmath29 could be strictly @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless , in the beginning we assume that @xmath14 is a normal index , so that @xmath29 is of degree exactly @xmath14 and holds .",
    "the tight connection of the analytic theory of pad approximants with the ( complex ) orthogonal polynomials is given by the fact that the denominators @xmath29 satisfy an orthogonality relation @xmath35 where we integrate along a closed jordan curve encircling @xmath36 .",

    "@xmath58-property _ , namely @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the normal vectors to @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath58-property and its generalizations play a crucial role in many branches of analysis and mathematical physics , see e.g.  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on a canonical example of a function from @xmath19 .",
    "namely , let @xmath62 , @xmath17 , be such that @xmath63 .",
    "we additionally assume that no proper subset of @xmath64 s adds up to an integer , so that the corresponding stahl s compact @xmath40 is a continuum .",
    "this is a sufficient condition for an underlying riemann surface having the maximal genus ( see below ) .",
    "however , for more precise hypotheses , see assumption [ assumption1 ] .",
    "the simplest non - trivial example of this situation is when @xmath41 , when @xmath43 is star - shaped ( chebotarev continuum ) .",
    "as it follows from the works of stahl , such `` stars '' along with analytic curves are the main building blocks for a generic @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath65 where the expansion is convergent in the neighborhood @xmath66 of infinity .",
    "we will agree in denoting by @xmath67 the branch of the square root in @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "as it was mentioned above , our main goal is to find the strong asymptotics of the pad denominators @xmath29 , as @xmath70 .",
    "we derive this asymptotics using two complementary methods . the first one , developed in section [ sec : wkb ] ,",
    "is based on the differential equation satisfied by @xmath9 and is a combination of the original ideas of nuttall from @xcite with some new developments in the asymptotic theory of generalized heun differential equations .",
    "the second method is the non - linear steepest descent analysis of deift and zhou ( see e.g.  @xcite ) based on the matrix riemann - hilbert problem @xcite solvable in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath51 . in section [ sec : rh ] we apply it exclusively to the case of @xmath41 .",
    "these two methods provide formally different expressions for the leading term of asymptotics of the pad denominators and pad residues .",
    "we find their comparison in section [ sec : comparison ] very illuminating .",
    "the form of the asymptotics for @xmath29 and @xmath51 was actually conjectured by nuttall in @xcite in terms of a function solving certain _ scalar _ boundary value problem .",
    "we show also that our results match the nuttall s conjecture , see section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the key observation is that function @xmath9 in is semiclassical : it satisfies the ode @xmath71 it can be proved by standard methods ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that as a consequence , the pad denominators @xmath29 , the pad numerators @xmath72 , and the remainders @xmath51 satisfy the laguerre equations :    [ theorem1 ] for each normal index @xmath14 there exist polynomials @xmath73 and @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 is solved by @xmath51 , @xmath76 and @xmath72 .",
    "in the case of @xmath29 , the ode is of the form @xmath77    let us use the notation @xmath78 for the zeros of the polynomials @xmath79 from theorem [ theorem1 ] : @xmath80 in order to simplify the situation and concentrate on the main ideas we impose the following assumptions on the zeros of @xmath79 :    [ assumption1 ] there exists a constant @xmath81 such that for all sufficiently large @xmath14 , latexmath:[\\[\\label{mainassumption }    in other words , all zeros @xmath78 of @xmath79 belong to the disk @xmath83 , and they stay away from the zeros of @xmath84 and from each other . and has to be treated separately .",
    "we avoid further discussion of this situation for the sake of simplicity . ]",
    "observe that the second part of this assumption is completely innocent : in a general case , we will have a reduction in genus and in a number of cycles in the basis of the underlying riemann surface , see below .    from assumption [ assumption1 ]",
    "it follows that for all sufficiently large @xmath14 the zeros of @xmath85 lie in the disk @xmath86 , see e.g.  @xcite , so that that the set @xmath87 is uniformly bounded .",

    "van vleck polynomial _ , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "theorem 2.1 from @xcite gives a global description of the trajectories of the quadratic differential @xmath92 .",

    "this formula should be understood in the following way : the right hand side is chosen for @xmath109 according to the branch of @xmath110 described above , and then both the left and the right hand sides are continued analytically along @xmath95 . in this way this formula may be extended from progressive paths to rectangles in the @xmath111 plane .",

    "observe also that from our conjecture [ assumption1 ] it follows that all zeros of @xmath47 are simple .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in 1986 j.  nuttall published in constructive approximation the paper @xcite , where with his usual insight he studied the behavior of the denominators ( `` generalized jacobi polynomials '' ) and the remainders of the pad approximants to a special class of algebraic functions with 3 branch points . </S>",
    "<S> 25 years later we try to look at this problem from a modern perspective . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , the generalized jacobi polynomials constitute an instance of the so - called heine - stieltjes polynomials , i.e.  they are solutions of linear ode with polynomial coefficients . on the other , they satisfy complex orthogonality relations , and thus are suitable for the riemann - hilbert asymptotic analysis . along with the names mentioned in the title , </S>",
    "<S> this paper features also a special appearance by riemann surfaces , quadratic differentials , compact sets of minimal capacity , special functions and other characters . </S>"
