    "in this paper , we consider a fluid described by the following equations in @xmath0 , @xmath1 with initial data @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a scalar function of @xmath4 .",
    "system ( [ goal_system ] ) describes the motion of a nonhomogeneous , also called density - dependent , fluid .",
    "the nonnegative scalar function @xmath5 is the density of the fluid , @xmath6 its velocity , and @xmath7 is the incompressible hydrostatic pressure generated by the divergence free constraint .",
    "the term @xmath8 is a slight generalization of a compressible pressure .",
    "this system is intended as a toy model for a general class of problems arising from mixture theory , which present the coehexistence of the hydrostatic pressure and a compressible pressure term .",
    "for instance , consider a simplified version of the model in @xcite , composed of just two constituents , a solid(/gel ) phase @xmath9 and a liquid phase @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the velocities of the solid and the liquid phase respectively , @xmath13 are source terms and @xmath14 is an experimental constant . using the last two conservation constraints , system ( [ biofilms_system ] ) can be reduced to @xmath15 where the equation for the solid phase velocity @xmath16 presents a pressure term composed by two parts , one incompressible part @xmath17 and the compressible one @xmath18 .",
    "more generally , these kinds of problems , which are characterized by the interaction between compressible and incompressible pressure terms , arise from _ mixture theory _ , as , for instance , models of biofilms @xcite , tumor growth @xcite and organic tissues and vasculogenesis @xcite .",
    "anyway , models deriving from mixture theory are similar to system ( [ biofilms_system1 ] ) , by replacing the compressible pressure @xmath19 with a more general function @xmath20 only depending on the solid phase . as a matter of facts , model ( [ biofilms_system1 ] ) presents several analytical difficulties , which we are trying to understand by studying a simplified version . in order to do this",
    ", the first idea is to consider a model where the solid phase @xmath9 and the liquid @xmath10 have the same transport velocity @xmath21 , and whose equation contains a compressible pressure term .",
    "these assumptions give the following model :    @xmath22    where @xmath5 is the density of the fluid and @xmath23 a general compressible pressure .",
    "actually , by defining a new pressure term @xmath24 , model ( [ density_dependent_ours ] ) can be reduced to    @xmath25    which is just the homogeneous incompressible euler equations plus a transport equation for the density variable and , although the techniques developed in this paper continue to work , it can be solved in a trivial way .",
    "therefore , we are going to study a mathematical generalization of model ( [ density_dependent_ours ] ) , represented by our system in ( [ goal_system ] ) , which has got most of the analytical difficulties of model ( [ biofilms_system1 ] ) .",
    "let us notice that system ( [ goal_system ] ) is somewhat similar to the density - dependent incompressible euler equations",
    "@xmath26 which have been studied by many authors , see for instance _ j. e. marsden _",
    "@xcite , _ h. beiro da veiga _",
    "a. valli _ @xcite & _ r. danchin _ @xcite .",
    "let us remark that , in @xcite , _ valli _ and _ zajaczkowski _ have studied model ( [ density_dependent ] ) by using an approximating system where the divergence of the velocity field gradually vanishes in a similar way to the chorin - temam projection method in @xcite . although model ( [ goal_system ] ) looks quite similar to the density - dependent model ( [ density_dependent ] ) , it happens that , apart from the vorticity method , which we have still not fully explored , most of the ideas used to approach it do not apply to our system .",
    "the main problem is that we can not expect to gain one more space derivative for the pressure term @xmath7 with respect to the regularity of the other unknowns @xmath27 , as it is in the case of classical incompressible fluids .",
    "this can be viewed by applying the divergence operator to the velocity equation in ( [ goal_system ] ) , which yields @xmath28 now , if @xmath29 , h^{m}(\\mathbb{r}^{d}))$ ] , then @xmath30 , h^{m}(\\mathbb{r}^{d}))$ ] , namely @xmath31 , h^{m-1}(\\mathbb{r}^{d}))$ ] . on the other hand , if we look at the method of resolution of the density - dependent euler equations in @xcite , this leads to consider the following elliptic equation in the pressure term @xmath32 in this case , the regularity of @xmath5 and @xmath33 guarantees , if @xmath34 + 1 $ ] , one more space derivative of regularity for the pressure term , namely : if @xmath27 belong to @xmath35 , h^{m}(\\mathbb{r}^{d}))$ ] , then @xmath7 belongs to @xmath36 , h^{m+1}(\\mathbb{r}^{d}))$ ] .",
    "conversely , considering system ( [ goal_system ] ) and the related elliptic equation ( [ pressure_elliptic ] ) , we realize that it is not easy to obtain energy estimates on equation ( [ pressure_elliptic ] ) , since we have not enough regularity in terms of the incompressible pressure @xmath7 .",
    "this is exactly what happens for system ( [ biofilms_system1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , here we estabilish the well - posedeness of system ( [ goal_system ] ) , using an approximation based on paradifferential calculus .",
    "next , we show the convergence of a new singular perturbation approximation that can be considered as a continuous - in time - version of the projection method in @xcite , which turns out to work also on the homogeneous incompressible euler equations .",
    "finally , we briefly show that also the more classical artificial compressibility method in @xcite works on system ( [ goal_system ] ) .",
    "we point out that these three methods - the application of paradifferential calculus , our continuous version of the projection method and the adapted artificial compressibility , which we have applied in order to prove well - posedness of system ( [ goal_system ] ) - do not seem to work on the density - dependent euler equations , see remarks [ remark1 ] , [ remark3 ] , and [ remark2 ] .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , we explain some structural characteristics of system ( [ goal_system ] ) , which will be useful in the following .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the definition of the first type of approximation based on paradifferential operators and the related proof of existence and uniqueness . in section 3",
    ", we prove the convergence of our continuous version of the projection method .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we shortly discuss the artificial compressibility approximation and its convergence .",
    "[ first_remark ] notice that , when the function @xmath37 only depends on the density variable @xmath5 , the velocity equation in ( [ goal_system ] ) , with the divergence free condition @xmath38 , leads to system ( [ density_dependent_ours ] ) and then to ( [ reduced ] ) , where the homogeneous incompressible euler equations can be solved in order to get the unknown density @xmath5 by its transport equation .",
    "therefore , in that case we have smooth solutions to system ( [ goal_system ] ) , in accordance with the regularity of the solutions to the homogeneous incompressible euler equations , which can be seen in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 . system ( [ goal_system ] ) can be written in the compact form    @xmath41    with initial data ( [ initial ] )    @xmath42    where , in the @xmath43-dimensional case    @xmath44    and , in the general @xmath45-case , for @xmath46    @xmath47    the symbol @xmath48 associated to the paradifferential operator related to system ( [ goal_compact ] ) is    @xmath49    we get the eigenvalues    * @xmath50 * @xmath51 * @xmath52    and the related eigenvectors    * @xmath53 , * @xmath54 , * @xmath55 , * @xmath56 , * @xmath57 , * @xmath58 .    *",
    "assumptions * : [ assumptions ] notice from above that , in order to have real and semisimple eigenvalues , which is an essential property to guarantee hyperbolicity ( see @xcite ) , we have to assume @xmath59 strictly positive .",
    "now , let us go back to the general setting of system ( [ goal_compact ] ) .",
    "first , let us neglect for a while the incompressible pressure term @xmath60 in ( [ goal_compact ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is easy to check that we are considering a friedrichs symmetrizable hyperbolic system , whose ( positive definite , since remark [ assumptions ] and remark [ translation ] ) symmetrizer is the diagonal @xmath61 matrix    @xmath62    to clarify the calculations below , we write the explicit expression of    @xmath63    for @xmath64 .",
    "[ translation ] since ( [ symmetrizer1 ] ) and ( [ symm_aj ] ) , we require that the scalar variable @xmath5 is not vanishing for every @xmath65 .",
    "this can be obtained by recalling that the density equation in ( [ goal_system ] ) can be written as @xmath66 therefore , if the initial datum @xmath67 in ( [ initial ] ) is not vanishing for all @xmath68 , then @xmath69 can not vanish under some standard assumptions of regularity .",
    "in particular , if the initial datum for the density @xmath67 is in @xmath70 and @xmath71 , lip(\\mathbb{r}^{d}))$ ] , the positivity of @xmath5 follows by the results in @xcite . in the following",

    "finally , notice that the non - vanishing density variable is a condition also required by the particular case of system ( [ density_dependent_ours ] ) where , as in ( [ biofilms_system1 ] ) , the compressible pressure @xmath76 and , overall , by the general system ( [ biofilms_system1 ] ) , where @xmath9 is the considered density .",
    "this last observation shows that , although explicitly shown only by the expression of the symmetrizer ( [ symmetrizer1 ] ) , this is an intrinsic hypothesis of models ( [ goal_system ] ) , ( [ density_dependent_ours ] ) and ( [ biofilms_system1 ] ) .    at this point , applying the symmetrizer @xmath77 to system ( [ goal_compact ] ) , we obtain the symmetric formulation    @xmath78    we point out that    @xmath79    this means that the @xmath80-scalar product preserves the gradient function @xmath17 and this essential fact makes possible to merge energy estimates induced by the symmetrizer , as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , with the leray projector in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ symmetric_compact ] ) using ( [ reasonable ] ) .",
    "then , we have    @xmath81    now , following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we project equation ( [ symmetric ] ) onto the space of the divergence free velocity @xmath33 .",
    "namely , setting    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the standard leray projector and , applying the projector operator ( [ projector ] ) to ( [ symmetric ] ) , this last equation becomes    @xmath84    by definition ( [ projector ] ) , @xmath85 thanks to the divergence free property of the unknown @xmath33 in ( [ goal_system ] ) .",
    "this observation leads to the alternative formulation    @xmath86    alternatively , it is possible to project system ( [ goal_compact ] ) and , after that , apply the symmetrizer @xmath80 just to get energy estimates .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath87    without any condition on the divergence of the velocity field @xmath33 , i.e. the second equation in ( [ goal_compact ] ) , which is implicitly contained in ( [ proj_formulation ] ) and ( [ proj_formulation_no_symm ] ) .    systems ( [ proj_formulation ] ) and ( [ proj_formulation_no_symm ] ) are equivalent .    applying the symmetrizer @xmath80 in ( [ symmetrizer1 ] ) to equation ( [ proj_formulation_no_symm ] )",

    "following @xcite , the first idea is to approximate the compact and translated version ( [ goal_system_translated ] ) of system ( [ goal_compact ] ) by a simple regularization of the equations , using mollifiers @xmath117 .",

    ". moreover , the initial data ( [ compact_incompressible_initial_data ] ) associated to system ( [ compact_incompressible ] ) are consistent with respect to the hypothesis of slightly compressible initial data in @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to the incompressible limit in @xcite , the proof of convergence of a solution to system ( [ compact_incompressible ] ) to a solution to the goal system ( [ goal_system ] ) is straightforward here , provided , as we have already point out , the apposite translation on the variable @xmath5 that we have made in section 2 .",
    "[ remark2 ] applying the artificial compressibility method to system ( [ density_dependent ] ) , we obtain an approximation system whose matrices and the related friedrichs symmetrizer do not satisfy the assumptions stated in @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the two - dimensional case , setting @xmath488 , we have the system @xmath504"
