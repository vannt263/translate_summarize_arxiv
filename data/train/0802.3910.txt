    "the most important internal driver of disk galaxy evolution are stellar bars , because they efficiently redistribute angular momentum between the disk and dark matter halo ( e.g. , combes & sanders 1981 ; weinberg 1985 ; athanassoula 2002 ) . to put bars in a cosmological context ,",
    "we must determine what effects environment has on bar and galaxy evolution .",
    "the bar fraction and properties in clusters relative to that found in field galaxies depend on several factors , such as the epoch of bar formation , the higher densities in clusters at early times leading to earlier collapse of dark matter halos , and the relative importance of processes such as ram pressure stripping , galaxy tidal interactions , mergers , and galaxy harassment .",
    "for example , tidal interactions can induce a bar in a dynamically cold disk , but they may also heat the disk , making it less unstable to bar formation .",
    "previous studies have found opposing results for the bar fraction in isolated galaxies and those that are perturbed or in clusters ( van den bergh 2002 ; varela et al .",
    "we use our large supercluster sample of galaxies ( @xmath22000 over @xmath3 -15.5 to -24.0 ) from the stages survey of the abell 901/902 supercluster ( @xmath1  0.165 ) to investigate the fraction and properties of bars and their host disks in a dense environment .",
    "to study galaxies in a dense cluster environment , we use the space telescope a901/902 galaxy evolution survey ( stages ; gray et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the abell 901/902 supercluster ( @xmath1  0.165 , number of galaxies per unit area n=250mpc@xmath4 ) consists of three clusters : a901a , a901b , and a902 with an average core separation of @xmath2  1mpc .",
    "the a901 clusters show irregular x - ray morphologies , suggesting that they are not yet relaxed ( ebeling et al .",
    "the stages survey includes high resolution @xmath0 acs f606w images ( psf @xmath2  @xmath5 , corresponding to @xmath2  300pc at @xmath1  0.165 and @xmath6 = 70 km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 . ] ) of the abell 901/902 supercluster , along with spectrophotometric redshifts of accuracy @xmath8/(1 + @xmath9 )  @xmath2  0.02 down to @xmath10= 24 from the combo-17 survey ( wolf et al 2004 ) .",
    "multi - wavelength coverage is available for this field from @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and xmm - newton .",
    "dark matter maps for the supercluster have been constructed using gravitational lensing by gray et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and heymans et al .",
    "( 2008 , mnras submitted ) .",
    "the cluster sample contains 798 bright , @xmath13 , galaxies .",
    "to identify and characterize the properties of bars , we employ the widely used method of fitting ellipses to the galaxy isophotes out to sky level with the iraf task ellipse ( e.g. , friedli et al . 1996 ; jogee et al . 1999 ; knapen et al . 2000 ; marinova & jogee 2007 ) .",
    "we generate plots of the surface brightness ( sb ) , ellipticity ( @xmath14 ) , and position angle ( pa ) as a function of radius for each galaxy .",
    "we also plot overlays of the fitted ellipses onto the galaxy image .",
    "we use both the overlays and radial plots to identify bars .",
    "a galaxy is identified as barred if ( a )  the @xmath14 profile rises to a global maximum while the pa stays constant and ( b )  after the global max , the @xmath14 drops and the pa changes characterizing the disk region . to ensure reliable morphological classification",
    ", we exclude all galaxies with outer @xmath15 ( i @xmath16 ) . with our psf of @xmath2  @xmath5 , ( @xmath2  300pc at @xmath1  0.165 )",
    ", we can not reliably detect bars with diameter smaller than @xmath2  1.8kpc . however , such small bars are usually nuclear bars , whereas we focus only on primary bars , which have diameters greater than 2kpc .",
    "when working in the rest - frame optical , bars heavily obscured by dust and sf will be missed , while such bars can be detected in the rest - frame nir ( eskridge et al .",
    "2000 , knapen et al .",
    "2000 , marinova & jogee 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , partially obscured bars can be missed in ellipse - fits because dust and sf along the bar can cause the pa to vary marginally more than the 10@xmath17 allowed by the constant pa criterion .",
    "in fact , studies of nearby galaxies suggest that the bar fraction increases by a factor of @xmath2  1.3 in the nir , compared to the optical ( marinova & jogee 2007 ) . as we do not have rest - frame nir images for abell 901/902 , we resort to a second method of classifying bars : visual classification .",
    "the visual classification method tends to capture partially obscured bars somewhat better than ellipse fits , because visual classification takes into account , not only the stellar light in the bar , but also secondary signatures , such as the shape of dust lanes , the overall morphology of the disk , and spiral arms .",
    "all bar studies to date carried out in field samples define the bar fraction @xmath18 as the ratio ( number of barred _ disks_/ total number of _ disks _ ) . an accurate determination of @xmath19 therefore hinges on an accurate way to identify disk galaxies . in field samples , both locally and at intermediate redshifts , two techniques are widely used to identify disks : srsic cuts ( @xmath202.5 ) based on single component fits , and luminosity - color cuts to isolate blue cloud galaxies from the red sequence .",
    "these methods have limitations even in field samples : the srsic cut can miss bright disks with prominent bulges ( where @xmath212.5 ) and the luminosity - color selection misses bright disks with red colors ( caused by old stellar populations or dust - reddening ) .    in dense cluster environments , where disk galaxies can be red , and where the luminosity function is dominated by faint dwarf galaxies , it becomes even harder to identify disks via either method .",
    "we illustrate these uncertainties in disk selection in the supercluster as follows .",
    "the barred galaxies identified in @xmath22  3 , from ellipse fit and visual classification , are plotted on the color - luminosity ( figure  1a ) and srsic -luminosity ( figure  1b ) planes .",
    "because bars are disk signatures , we can use the strongly barred galaxies missed by the two methods as a lower limit on their failure to select disk galaxies .",
    "for bright galaxies , we find that 46% ( 45/97 ) and 40% ( 39/97 ) of disks with prominent , visually - identified bars are missed , respectively , by the blue cloud color - luminosity cut and srsic cut .",
    "it is clear that the uncertainties in disk selection will cause a large and dominant error in the optical bar fraction @xmath18 in clusters .",
    "we therefore adopt the following approach in the a901/902 supercluster ( 1 )  we define a new quantity @xmath23 as the proportion of _ all galaxies _ ( rather than disk galaxies ) , which are barred . thus , @xmath23 is not as heavily affected as @xmath18 by the uncertainties in disk selection .",
    "( 2 )  we explore how @xmath23 and bar properties vary as a function of galaxy properties , such as color ( figure 1a ) , stellar mass ( figure 1c , d ) , sfr ( figure 1c ) , specific sfr ( figure 1d ) , and bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "( 3 )  when comparing the frequency of bars in clusters to that in the field , we can only use @xmath18 , since no measurements of @xmath23 exist in the field .",
    "we estimate @xmath18 by selecting disks via visual classification , rather than from color - luminosity or srsic cuts .",
    "disk are identified visually based on features such as spiral arms and stellar bars , or the presence of a bulge+disk from the light distribution .",
