    "the possibility that an appreciable fraction of the atomic hydrogen ( ) found in the spiral arms of disk galaxies is dissociated molecular gas was first suggested about a decade ago from a comparison of the relative placement of the dust lanes ,  regions ( h@xmath0 ) , and  ridges in parts of m83 ( allen , atherton , & tilanus 1985 , 1986 ) and m51 ( tilanus & allen 1987 ) .",
    "this interpretation of the observations is based on the density - wave model for spiral structure , in which the temporal sequence of massive star formation is spread out in space across a spiral arm by the action of a density wave driving the interstellar gas .",
    "more detailed work has subsequently been done , including comparisons with other spiral tracers , such as the nonthermal radio continuum and the co emission , for m83 ( tilanus & allen 1993 ) , for m51 ( vogel , kulkarni , & scoville 1988 ; tilanus & allen 1989 , 1990 , 1991 ; rand , kulkarni , & rice 1992 ; knapen et al .",
    "1992 ) , and more recently for m100 ( knapen & beckman 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "shaya & federman ( 1987 ) provided the first theoretical discussion of the uv photodissociation process as an explanation for the generally - flat radial distribution of  in galaxies .",
    "more recently , from observations of the  emission from galaxies and quantitative modelling of the results , stacey et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have confirmed that photodissociation regions ( pdrs ; e.g.  hollenbach & tielens 1995 ) are the sites of substantial  production in galaxy disks .",
    "madden et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have even suggested that , in their preferred model , virtually all of the  in the disk of ngc 6946 could be produced in pdrs .",
    "unfortunately , the angular resolution available with current instrumentation in the  line at @xmath5 is inadequate for the study of individual pdrs in nearby galaxies .",
    "the morphological details of tracers in spiral arms represent new evidence for the production of  by the extensive dissociation of h@xmath2  in pdrs .",
    "there are two new elements in the present study .",
    "first , m81 ( ngc3031 ) is a galaxy which is not bright in co emission ( e.g.  brouillet et al .",
    "the conventional interpretation using co as a tracer for h@xmath2  is that this galaxy contains relatively little molecular gas , contrary to the situation for the previously - studied galaxies m83 , m51 , and m100 .",
    "second , the availability of uv image data for m81 from the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) permits a comparison of the  morphology to the distribution of uv photons at @xmath6 nm ( @xmath7 ev ) , in the middle of the range of photon energies which are important for the dissociation of h@xmath2  ( stecher & williams 1967 )  molecules into higher vibrational states of the ground electronic state ( through lyman - werner band transitions ) .",
    "subsequently , photons with lower energies down to @xmath8 ev can then also dissociate h@xmath2  by facilitating transitions into the vibrational continuum of the ground electronic state . ] . to interpret the uv data , any effects of patchy obscuration by dust",
    "must be understood to properly compare the uv and  morphologies .",
    "h@xmath0 images of m81 aid in our investigation of this effect . in our galaxy ,",
    "the far - uv extinction ( in mags ) at @xmath9 nm is greater than the extinction at h@xmath0 ( @xmath10 nm ) by a factor of more than 3 .",
    "therefore , any effect of varying obscuration on the morphology of the h@xmath0 in m81 is greatly magnified in the far uv .",
    "the 640 sec far - uv exposure of m81 ( fuv0556 ; hill et al .",
    "1995 ) is from the uit / astro-1 archive , and is centered at @xmath11 nm with bandwidth 35.4 nm ( stecher et al .",
    "the vla  data were taken by b.  hine & a.  rots , and are provided by d.  westpfahl _ vs. _ @xmath12 ) and more suitable for comparison with the uv image . ] .",
    "we used the  data cube to calculate a map of  column density n ( ) .",
    "only those pixels with absolute values in excess of 2.5 times the rms noise in the channel maps are used in the moment calculation , with the additional restriction that such values must occur in at least two adjacent velocity channels ( which are separated by 10 ) .",
    "m.  kaufman and n.  devereux provided h@xmath0 images of m81 .",
    "although we use the newer data ( devereux , jacoby , & ciardullo 1995 ) for our illustrations , the older data ( kaufman et al .",
    "1989a ) provide an important `` second opinion '' in a few cases where smoothed cosmic - ray hits on the ccd look like  regions , or where foreground stars are imperfectly subtracted .    in combining the different data sets",
    ", we first ensure that the astrometry of the individual images is consistent by checking the positions of the center of the galaxy and several foreground stars ( uv and h@xmath0 ) and the location and orientation of the general spiral arm features ( ) .",
    "the original astrometry provided with the data sets is excellent .",
    "any difference in alignment between images appears to be no greater than @xmath13 , which is negligible in comparison with the final resolution of @xmath1 used here .",
    "the next step is to smooth the different images to a common resolution of @xmath1 , which is that of the  image ( linear resolution 150 pc at our adopted distance of 3.7 mpc ) .",
    "the angular resolutions of the uv and h@xmath0 images are determined by fitting 2d gaussian profiles to a number of point - like sources in the frames .",
    "we then convolve the images with the appropriate gaussians in order to obtain smoothed images at the resolution of the  image .",
    "the images are then interpolated to a common pixel grid in order to facilitate a direct comparison of the positions of various features .",
    "full - sized uit images of m81 in the near- and far - uv ( fuv ) are shown as figures 1 & 2 in hill et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and are not duplicated here .",
    "similarly , the full h@xmath0 image is figure 1 in devereux et al .",
    "our independent derivation of the  column density map is essentially identical to figure 13 in kaufman et al .",
    "( 1989a ) . for reference ,",
    "figure [ fullgal ] shows a contour representation of the fuv image ( smoothed to @xmath1 ) , overlaid on a grey - scale representation of the  image of the galaxy .",
    "five frames indicate the locations of the sub - fields , which we will discuss in more detail below .",
    "first , the radial distributions of the three tracers are considered .",
    "figure [ radials ] shows the radial distributions of the three tracers :  ( bottom panel ) , fuv ( middle panel ) , and h@xmath0 ( top panel ) .",
    "the curves are derived from the input images by averaging in elliptical annuli of widths @xmath14 spaced every @xmath14 ( @xmath15 pc ) along the major axis .",
    "we used @xmath16 for the inclination angle of the galaxy , and pa @xmath17 for the position angle of the major axis ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) ; these values were kept constant for all ellipses and for each input image data set .",
    "the large - scale axially - symmetric morphology of the galaxy is reproduced clearly in the profiles of fig.[radials ] .",
    "both the fuv and h@xmath0 are centrally peaked , whereas the  profile reflects the central deficiency of atomic hydrogen seen in fig.[fullgal ] . from @xmath18",
    "to @xmath19 the three tracers show similar features : first , the fuv and h@xmath0 , which trace massive star formation , both rise to their maximum values near @xmath20 , after which they both generally decline .",
    "more surprising is the detailed correlation of the peaks and valleys of these two profiles between @xmath21 and @xmath22 radius , which strongly suggests that dust extinction does not appreciably affect the morphology of either the fuv or the h@xmath0 emission . in the following section",
    "we show that even the details of the fuv and h@xmath0 images on the @xmath23 pc scale appear to be largely unaffected by dust .",
    "second , the  distribution shows roughly the same behavior as the massive - star tracers . the steep rise between @xmath18 and @xmath21 discussed above",
    "is clearly reproduced in , as are the relative dip around @xmath24 and the secondary peak at @xmath25 .",
    "the conventional interpretation of this behavior is simply that more  leads to more star formation .",
    "however , our preferred alternative interpretation is that the  radial profile naturally follows those of fuv and h@xmath0 because the  is a _ product _ of the star formation , through dissociation , rather than a precursor to it .",
    "thus , where the star formation is enhanced , more  is produced , which is just what the radial profiles show .",
    "earlier work on m81 ( e.g.  kaufman et al .   1989a ) and on many other nearby galaxies shows that the  and the h@xmath0 trace spiral structure in much the same general way at a linear resolution of @xmath26 kpc . hill et al .",
    "( 1995 ) also showed the excellent correspondence between h@xmath0 peaks and fuv peaks in m81 .",
    "the -fuv images overlaid in fig.[fullgal ] further illustrate this general coincidence .",
    "however the detailed correspondence between fuv , h@xmath0 , and  emission is more complicated . to illustrate this richness of detail",
    ", we present and discuss the images in 5 fields positioned as indicated in fig.[fullgal ] . in figs .",
    "[ fieldone]-[fieldfive ] , we show for each field first the contours of the fuv emission overlaid on a grey - scale representation of itself , then overlaid on the h@xmath0 , and finally on the  emission . in each middle panel",
    "we also mark the @xmath27-band dust filaments of kaufman , elmegreen & bash ( 1989b ) .",
    "dust in the galaxy is unevenly distributed , and the continuum extinction at @xmath9 nm is about 4 times that at visual wavelengths .",
    "therefore the fuv image ought to show significantly more small - scale structure than the h@xmath0 image .",
    "instead , the opposite occurs ; the fuv emission is smoother and spread more widely than the h@xmath0 , as can be seen from a comparison of the `` fuv - on - fuv '' and `` fuv - on - h@xmath0 '' panels in figs .",
    "[ fieldone]-[fieldfive ] .",
    "there are two aspects to this unexpected h@xmath0-fuv correspondence .",
    "first , every reliable bright peak in the h@xmath0 has a counterpart in the fuv .",
    "second , there are many places with extended and relatively intense fuv emission which have little or no associated h@xmath0 .",
    "the fact that every reliable bright peak in the h@xmath0 has a counterpart in the fuv must mean that the effects of extinction on the morphology are small on the scale of 150 pc , so that either both the h@xmath0 and the fuv appear either essentially unobscured , or both are partly hidden in approximately the same way .",
    "the extinction may also be so high that _ neither _ the fuv _ nor _ the h@xmath0 are visible-[fieldfive ] in this paper .",
    "with such a patchy geometry it is unlikely that _ all parts _ of a large  region consisting of half a dozen o stars could be hidden , as is corroborated by detailed comparisons of the thermal radio emission with the h@xmath0 in e.g.  m101 ( israel , goss , & allen 1975 ) , ngc 6946 ( van der kruit , allen , & rots 1977 ) , and m51 ( tilanus et al .   1988 ) .",
    "none of those galaxies appear to harbor large  regions which are entirely hidden by dust . ] .",
    "there are a few regions which appear to emit relatively strong h@xmath0 but do not have a counterpart in fuv .",
    "such regions are for instance located at @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( in the middle of a uv void in field  1 ) , at @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( linear structure @xmath32 long in field  3 ) , or at @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( small crescent - shaped object in field  3 ) . however , none of these h@xmath0 features appear on the older h@xmath0 image of kaufman et al .",
    "( 1989a ) ( not shown here ) , confirming that these features on the devereux et al .",
    "h@xmath0 image are most probably not  regions at all , but artifacts such as ( smoothed ) cosmic ray events or improperly - subtracted foreground stars image of kaufman et al .  also shows a number of ``  regions '' which do not appear on the devereux et al .   h@xmath0 image . ] .",
    "while every reliable bright peak on the h@xmath0 image has a counterpart in the fuv image with the same position and general shape , there are many places with extended and relatively intense fuv emission which have little or no associated h@xmath0 .",
    "there are even regions of relatively bright fuv emission , such as those at @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( field  1 ) , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( field  4 ) , which show hardly any counterparts in h@xmath0 at the present levels of sensitivity .    in principle",
    ", some of these uv sources could be artifacts on the uit fuv image .",
    "there are five kinds of artifacts in the uit data which could be important for us : 1 ) _ `` bright spots '' : _ there are one or two bright spots in each uit camera ; they occur within 200 pixels of the edge of the image .",
    "the m81 image is in the central parts of the field , so we are not concerned with these artifacts .",
    "2 ) _ cosmic rays : _ these are rare on uit images , ranging from none to several per image . they are always very bright , saturated , and extended blobs which do not look like stars . the full - resolution uit fuv frame we have used does not appear to have such features .",
    "3 ) _ foreground galactic stars : _ typically there are one or two uv - bright galactic foreground stars in each uit field at the intermediate galactic latitudes of m81 .",
    "these are mostly v @xmath39 mag a stars , so they are bright in optical ccd images .",
    "again , there are no such stars known within the optical image of m81 .",
    "4 ) _ scratches : _ the uit detector is photographic film , and scratches can appear on it from the handling and developing processes .",
    "these are visible at faint levels , but are easily recognizable as long narrow parallel lines .",
    "smoothing will reduce their impact , and our m81 image does not show the effects of scratches .",
    "5 ) _ dust specks : _ during densitometry of the flight film in a clean room environment , some dust contamination still appears , which mimics stars .",
    "since only the larger specks are important for this paper , the reality of all bright sources is easily confirmed by comparison with the uit 128 sec shorter exposure of the same field ( fuv0557 ) .    the features in m81 which are relatively strong in the uv but weak in h@xmath0 are not artifacts .",
    "apparently , the stars which power these regions produce ample amounts of dissociating fuv photons at @xmath9 nm , but relatively few ionizing photons at @xmath40 nm .",
    "we shall refer here to this stellar population as `` b - stars '' , but recognize that late o and early a stars may be included .",
    "differences in the relative amounts of uv and h@xmath0 in any given region could arise from differences in age , as has been discussed for m81 by hill et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and/or from variations in the imf .      from the third panel in figs.[fieldone]-[fieldfive ] ,  is often found alone at faint levels in the spiral arms , without closely - associated uv and with little or no h@xmath0 at the present sensitivity .",
    "however , in the neighborhood of a fuv concentration , the  tends to be brighter , and the brightest peaks are located at the _ periphery _ of the uv concentrations rather than at the position where the uv has its local maximum . the  may show a peak slightly offset from the fuv peak , for example in the small uv region near @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( field  1 ) ; but , more often , the  forms an elongated patch next to the fuv , such as near @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( field  2 ) , or @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( field  3 ) . on a larger scale ,  ridges a kiloparsec ( @xmath47 ) or more in length are found preferentially alongside uv ridges , such as the u - shaped  feature stretching across field  2 along the northern edge of the uv near @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the  ridge stretching in a n - s direction just to the east of the uv in field  3 near @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "some of the most interesting cases are those where the  surrounds the uv concentration , such as the fuv peak sitting inside the depression near @xmath52 , @xmath53 ( field  3 ) , and another at + @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( field  1 ) .",
    "a rather spectacular example of this morphology is the region near @xmath56 , @xmath31 ( field  3 ) where the  forms a `` halo '' surrounding two peaks of a large uv - emitting region .",
    "the northern peak of this pair corresponds with the relatively bright  region # 44 in the catalog of petit , sivan , & karachentsev ( 1988 ) and is also # 131 in kaufman et al .",
    "the southern peak is actually a loose group of small , faint  regions including # 55 in petit et al .  and several others , which also appear in fig.3 of kaufman et al .",
    "( 1987 ) but are apparently too faint to be catalogued there .        in the five fields",
    "we have identified a total of 144 sites of locally - enhanced fuv emission ( `` fuv peaks '' ) , of which 21 are `` strong '' + ( erg@xmath57@xmath58s@xmath59@xmath59arcsec@xmath60 ) . in 63% of the cases ( 90 ) ,",
    "h@xmath0 emission is associated and coincident with the fuv peak , in 13% ( 18 ) the associated h@xmath0 emission is slightly offset .",
    "for 10% ( 14 peaks ) of the fuv peaks no associated h@xmath0 emission is evident on our images at the present level of sensitivity .",
    "another 15% ( 22 ) could not be easily classified ; this category includes regions with diffuse h@xmath0 emission , possible unsubtracted residuals from foreground stars in the h@xmath0 image , and sources on the uv image which may be galactic foreground stars .      of the 144 fuv peaks",
    ", only 8% ( 11 peaks ) do not show any appreciable  emission that can reasonably be considered as associated with the uv peak ( i.e.  within @xmath61 pc ) . in 11% of the cases ( 16 )",
    "the is coincident with the fuv , but in a striking majority of 81% of all fuv peaks the  is seen offset from the fuv .",
    "the latter category includes cases where the bright  peak is offset from the fuv , but there is still emission from the wings of the  extending towards the position of the fuv peak . of our 21 strong fuv peaks , one ( 5% ) may have coincident  emission , but 20 , or possibly all ( 100% ) have associated  emission offset from the fuv peak .",
    "the conventional description of the star formation process begins with the ( possibly triggered ) gravitational collapse of massive gas clouds in the disk of a galaxy .",
    "these `` super - clouds '' may be in the form of  or h@xmath2 , depending on the physical conditions in the ism ( e.g.  elmegreen 1991 and references therein ; elmegreen 1993 ) .",
    "the denser parts of these clouds cool further ( and turn into h@xmath2  if they are nt already in that form ) in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ; stars then form and evolve in these gmcs ( e.g.  shu et al .",
    "1993 ) . in this picture ,",
    "a small fraction of the gas is consumed in the star formation process , and a larger fraction may be ionized and/or evacuated by stellar winds and supernovae . some photodissociation of h@xmath2  into  has also been observed on the surfaces of specific gmcs in our galaxy ( e.g.  blitz 1993 , section 6 ; andersson & wannier 1993 ; kuchar & bania 1993 ) and column densities of order  have been reported ; but the photodissociation process is usually not thought of as being responsible for producing a substantial fraction of the galactic .",
    "however , our model for the morphology of the uv , h@xmath0 , and  in m81 leads to the conclusion that a large fraction , and possibly all , of the  in the inner spiral arms of that galaxy is a photodissociation product .",
    "the , h@xmath0 , and fuv structures observed in m81 can be understood if `` chimneys '' , like those proposed by norman & ikeuchi ( 1989 ) , are common in the spiral arms of this galaxy . in this picture ,",
    "holes 100 pc in size are blown out of the galactic disk by concentrations of high - mass star formation activity , similar to that discovered above the galactic  region ic1805 by normandeau , taylor , & dewdney ( 1996 ) . from our vantage point above the disk of m81 , such concentrations of star - forming activity are seen essentially free of obscuration , since the hot stars have evacuated or destroyed most of the intervening dust in m81 .",
    "the gas in m81 is largely in the form of h@xmath2 at least in the main part of the disk ;  is produced extensively by uv photons from the young stars impinging on the inner surfaces of these structures .",
    "the detailed structure of such an  layer may resemble the  morphology of the galactic star - forming region g216 - 2.5 , which has been explained as a pdr by williams & maddalena ( 1996 ) .",
    "this region shows a layer of  @xmath62 pc thick spread over 300 pc on the outer surface of a molecular cloud ; the  column density is of order .",
    "the cause of the photodissociation is thought to be two young stars located @xmath63 pc from the  layer .    in fig.[cartoon",
    "] we show a simplified cross - sectional sketch of the various morphologies which may arise in such a picture .",
    "the observer views the galaxy disk from above .",
    "case i illustrates the ic1805 geometry , which forms the basis for our model .",
    "a young star cluster has formed just above the mid - plane in a dense layer of molecular gas .",
    "the h@xmath2  layer is shown in the sketch as a smooth medium but will have structure . if o stars are present , the accompanying h@xmath0 will be roughly coincident with the uv . since the star - formation activity has opened a chimney up into the halo , the observer sees the optical and uv emission with little obscuration , even though the h@xmath2  layer underneath the bottom of the chimney will contain dust and may be opaque .",
    "the , produced from the h@xmath2  by photodissociation , is spread over the inner surface of the chimney and will appear to the observer to be enhanced at the edges of the region , owing to the longer lines of sight there .",
    "case ii is the same geometry as case i , but since the chimney has blown out on the far side of a more - or - less opaque disk of gas , the observer may measure nothing more than a patch of  emission .",
    "case iii in fig.[cartoon ] shows a particularly energetic star - forming region located very close to the mid - plane of the galaxy . in this case",
    ", chimneys may blow out on both sides of the disk , leaving a hole right through the galaxy .",
    "the photodissociated h@xmath2  will appear to the observer as an  `` cocoon '' wrapped around the boundary of the uv - emitting region , as seen e.g.  in field 3 .",
    "case iv is a one - sided version of case iii , formed in a non - uniform part of the h@xmath2  layer ; it is a more energetic example of the model for g216 - 2.5 by williams & maddelena ( 1996 ) .",
    "a simple way to obtain a rough order of magnitude for the  column density in a pdr is to consider the case where the dust opacity controls the depth to which uv penetrates the surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "this will occur when self - shielding by h@xmath2  is relatively unimportant ( low volume density ) . in this case , the uv penetrates and dissociates to a depth where the uv opacity @xmath64 . with the usual values for dust - to - gas ratio appropriate for translucent lines of sight in the galaxy , namely , n(h ) =  @xmath65 a@xmath66  atoms ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) , and using @xmath67 a@xmath66  ( seaton 1979 ) , we have @xmath68 at n(h ) = atoms , predominantly in the form of .",
    "this value is close to the threshold values of n ( ) found in the immediate neighborhood of fuv concentrations in the five fields under discussion in this paper and shows that the dissociation picture provides the right order of magnitude for the  column density .",
    "many authors have developed detailed models of pdrs including self - shielding ; the review by hollenbach & tielens ( 1995 ) lists many relevant references .",
    "in particular ,  production in pdrs has been considered by federman , glassgold , & kwan ( 1979 ) for equilibrium models ; time - dependent models have been computed by roger and dewdney ( 1992 ) and by bertoldi & draine ( 1996 ) .",
    "sternberg ( 1988 ) has provided a convenient analytic solution to a simple semi - infinite slab geometry in equilibrium with uv radiation incident on one side .",
    "the solution gives the steady - state  column density along a line of sight perpendicular to the face of the slab , as a function of the fuv flux @xmath69 in units of draine s ( 1978 ) standard values @xmath70 for the ism near the sun , and the total volume density of h nucleii @xmath71 ( ) + @xmath72(h@xmath2 ) in the gas .",
    "using the parameters in this equation adopted by madden et al .",

    "the uv flux of this region integrated over a circular aperture @xmath74 in diameter on the full - resolution image is given by hill et al .  as f@xmath75 = erg@xmath57@xmath58s@xmath59@xmath76 ; we obtain a somewhat larger value of by direct integration of the contours of our ( smoothed ) image in fig.[fieldthree ] over the same area .",
    "this observed flux must be corrected for extinction at 150 nm .",
    "there are two parts to this correction : galactic foreground extinction , and extinction in m81 itself .",
    "consistent with our conclusion that the uv and  regions are essentially `` naked '' , the extinction in m81 itself is taken to be completely `` gray '' , caused by similar obscuration of parts of the emitting region both at uv and h@xmath0 .",
    "this kind of extinction can be revealed by a comparison of the thermal radio flux density of an  region with its h@xmath0 flux . with this method ,",

    "however , the detected  will have been heated by the photodissociation process to @xmath92 k , and the factor of @xmath93 in density is easily understood if the kinetic temperature of the precursor h@xmath2  is less than a plausible @xmath94 k.      the photodissociation picture provides a reasonable explanation for the  morphologies and column densities in the spiral arms of m81 .",
    "the underlying gas is of modest density , @xmath3 h nucleii , but must be widespread , since every uv source has photodissociated  in its immediate vicinity .",
    "the amount of h@xmath2  present in the spiral arms of m81 is uncertain , but it is likely to be at least as much as the , and may be significantly greater .",

    "table 3 ) .",
    "the conventional conversion factor linking @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) surface brightness and h@xmath2  column density must _ underestimate _ the quantity of molecular gas in the spiral arms of m81 _ by at least a factor of five . _",
    "a similar discrepancy was noted by kaufman et al .",
    "( 1989b ) in their study of the dust lanes in m81 .",
    "allen ( 1996 ) reviewed the case for using @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) brightnesses to infer h@xmath2  column densities in galaxy disks and concluded that this practice is unreliable .",
    "our present result in m81 contributed to that conclusion .",
    "our detailed morphological study of the fuv , h@xmath0 , and  in m81 at a resolution of 150 pc indicates that most of the  is uv - dissociated h@xmath2 , at least in the inner spiral arms of this galaxy . in this picture , the  in the spiral arms is a _ product _ of the star formation process rather than a precursor .",
    "a corollary of this picture is that the disk of m81 must harbor a large reservoir of molecular gas which has so far escaped detection , e.g.  in the @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) line .",
    "since m81 has a generally low level of heat production , as evidenced by the faintness of the nonthermal radio continuum and the generally low surface brightness in h@xmath0 emission , this molecular gas is likely to be generally cold and therefore faint in e.g.  @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) emission .",
    "the `` skins '' of these molecular clouds may be sufficiently warmed by nearby uv sources to be visible in @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) , but this emission will have a small spatial filling factor .",
    "the underlying cold clouds may be visible in the inner disk of m81 as broad emission lines of @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) characteristic of gmcs , but unusually faint and with abnormally low values of the @xmath4co(2 - 1)/@xmath4co(1 - 0 ) ratio .",
