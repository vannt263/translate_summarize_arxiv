    "in this paper we concentrate on the few - body interactions of @xmath3 mesons in three nucleon systems . these complement our knowledge on the @xmath3-nucleon interaction and properties of the @xmath3 meson itself .",
    "considerable experimental , phenomenological and theoretical work has been devoted to understand the @xmath9he system .",
    "early saturne experiments found a large cross section for the @xmath15he reaction close to the @xmath3 threshold , @xcite .",
    "one interesting feature of this process is an enhancement of the meson formation amplitude in the few mev energy region close to the threshold .",
    "a similar effect was also noted in the studies of the @xmath16 reactions made at celsius , @xcite . both of these reactions indicate the possibility for virtual or quasi - bound states to be formed in these systems .",
    "it is expected that in the deuteron the state of interest is a virtual state , whereas in helium it may also be virtual but there a bound state is not ruled out , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "while the slopes of the formation amplitudes indicate the existence of such states , more detailed properties may be found only with an extrapolation of these amplitudes below the @xmath9he threshold .",
    "this is made possible with the pion production experiments @xmath1 @xmath5h@xmath17 and @xmath18he@xmath19 undertaken by cosy , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these results obtained at backward angles supplement the older saturne cross sections measured some distance away from the threshold , @xcite .    in this work we present a multiple - channel @xmath0-matrix analysis of @xmath9he formation .",
    "in addition to the reactions listed above , we also include the data from the @xmath8 @xmath5h@xmath6 @xmath5he @xmath3 process studied at brookhaven , @xcite . altogether the data comprise 17 measurements .",
    "the number of important @xmath0-matrix parameters , obtained with some minor theoretical input , amounts to 4 .",
    "unfortunately the system is not strongly constrained , and so new data are welcome .",
    "a parallel study is devoted to the effect of @xmath3-@xmath11 mixing in these systems .",
    "it has been suggested in ref.@xcite that such a mixing is enhanced by the existence of a @xmath20he bound state .",
    "this enhancement has been found in a subsequent experiment , @xcite .",
    "these two related questions are discussed in this paper , which is organised as follows :    * section [ sect2 ] defines the mixed states of our system . *",
    "section [ sect3 ] discusses the @xmath0-matrix method applied to the four - channel two body subsystems of the meson-3n system .",
    "a full description , in the isospin symmetric limit , within a zero range approximation requires at least five real @xmath0-matrix elements .",
    "couplings to the open three - body and four - body channels induce phases .",
    "since the present data is not sufficient for a full determination of all the relevant @xmath0-matrix elements , a model of @xmath21(1535 ) dominance is used to remove some ambiguities . * in section [ sect4 ] the comparison with the experimental data indicates an attractive @xmath9he scattering length and the existence of a @xmath9he virtual state . also the question of @xmath3-@xmath11 mixing close to the @xmath9he threshold is discussed . * in section [ con ] some conclusions are made .",
    "let the isospin invariant states of @xmath3 and @xmath14 mesons be described by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "due to some isospin mixing interaction @xmath24 these states mix into the physical states @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the relation of these two equivalent sets of states is    @xmath27 \\ \\ \\ \\ { \\rm and } \\ \\ \\ \\     \\mid    \\pi   ) =   n [ \\mid   \\bar { \\pi } )   +   \\theta   \\mid   \\bar { \\eta } ) ] , \\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is a mixing parameter and @xmath29 is the normalisation factor .",
    "these two sets of states form a complete orthonormal basis with the relations @xmath30 the mixing parameter follows from interactions at the quark level .",
    "the latter are due to differences in the light quark masses and to electromagnetic effects . for calculations of the mixing angle",
    "we refer to the review in ref .",
    "this angle is usually expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the meson energies .",
    "the transitions in the few - body systems may be analysed in terms of the scattering matrices @xmath33 that lead to the physical @xmath3 and @xmath11 in the final states @xmath34 on the other hand , when discussing the formation processes and final state @xmath3 interactions , that are supposed to be isospin conserving , it is more convenient to use the isospin basis @xmath35 the simple relationship between these amplitudes is @xmath36 @xmath37 the physical @xmath33 matrix elements are used to describe the experimental data .",
    "however , to parameterise these data we are going to use the isospin basis amplitudes for the scattering matrix @xmath33 and for the reaction matrix @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , the s - wave scattering matrix @xmath38 for the _ idealised _ four channel two - body system @xmath39 , @xmath40he@xmath41 , @xmath42@xmath43he@xmath44 , @xmath45h@xmath46 is introduced .",
    "these channels are denoted by the suffices @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the important couplings to open few - body channels are at first forgotten . the scattering matrix and the basic interactions are described and parameterised in terms of a real @xmath0-matrix .",
    "next , the heitler equation for the @xmath33-matrix is solved .",
    "this becomes a simple matrix equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the channel indices and @xmath50 is a diagonal matrix of the cm momenta in each channel . here",
    "the region of interest spans from about 10 mev below the @xmath51he threshold to some 10 mev above it . for these low energies the experimental data exists",
    "also , in this region the @xmath52 elements are believed to be constant .",
    "the model used here supposes the interactions to conserve isospin . in this way the @xmath0-matrix is calculated in - between the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath53 states . since the isospin symmetry for the @xmath8 is supposedly not violated one has @xmath54 and , in addition",
    ", some simple symmetries relate the matrix elements in the @xmath42@xmath2he@xmath44 and @xmath45h@xmath46 channels . in this way",
    "the parameters needed to fix the 4@xmath554 @xmath0-matrix are reduced from 10 to 6 .",
    "these are @xmath56 . in practice ,",
    "only five of these matrix elements are needed , since the coupling to the entrance @xmath57 channel is very small and so one finds @xmath58 to be irrelevant .",
    "other elements are related by the isospin symmetry : @xmath59 .",
    "the solution of the four dimensional eq.([k1 ] ) may be brought to a typical form @xmath60 where the scattering length in the @xmath61 system @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 and the transition length @xmath64 is @xmath65 for the pion production amplitudes one obtains @xmath66 where @xmath67 + i q_{\\eta } k_{p,\\eta } k_{\\eta,\\pi } }                                    { 1- i 3 q_{\\pi } k_{\\pi,\\pi}}\\ ] ] and the isospin relationship between the @xmath68 and @xmath69 is satisfied .",
    "equations ( [ k2 ] - [ k6 ] ) contain expressions which change rapidly in the small @xmath70 region .",
    "one such term involves the scattering length @xmath62 . a quasi - bound state , if it exists , is given by the condition @xmath71 which is to be satisfied by a complex momentum @xmath72 . for a large @xmath73",
    "this momentum is close to the threshold and the factor @xmath74 induces rapid energy dependence of the formation amplitudes in this region .",
    "this has been found in the @xmath3 production experiment @xcite , @xcite , but one can expect a similar behaviour in other channels .",
    "however , in the pion production amplitudes another factor arises which tends to suppress such an effect .",
    "it is due to the @xmath75 of eq.([k6 ] ) .",
    "there the existence of a quasi - bound state is expressed as the dominance of @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath76 were to differ from @xmath62 in a significant way , then one would expect a sizable energy dependence in the pion formation amplitude .",
    "however , as will be seen later , the indications are that @xmath77",
    ". this question is discussed in the following section .",
    "the real physical situation involves the coupling of the two body channels to the continuum spectrum of three - body @xmath78 and four - body @xmath79 channels .",
    "the coupling to these systems may be strong and it is not easy to calculate .",
    "on phenomenological grounds it requires additional terms in the @xmath0-matrix , so that @xmath80 where the summation ( an integration ) over the continuum few - body channels @xmath81 is to be performed .",
    "this equation induces complex contributions to the real two channel matrix elements . in this subsection",
    "we estimate the magnitude of these contributions .",
    "the phases that arise are calculated in terms of a model or left to a best fit determination .",
    "the fine tuning of the parameters is done in the next section .",
    "the large matrix elements are those related to the low energy @xmath10he channel .",
    "these enter essentially in the form of final state interaction factors in the @xmath10he system .",
    "one can visualise the relationship between the @xmath0-matrix parametrisation and a model description of the meson formation via an expression @xmath82.\\ ] ] here , @xmath83 denotes a wave function in the initial channel @xmath84 and @xmath85 is an operator responsible for the meson formation .",
    "the term in square brackets is the final state wave function expressed in terms of the @xmath86he scattering matrix @xmath87 . up to terms linear in the final momentum @xmath88 , one obtains from eqs.([k2 ] ) and ( [ k9 ] ) @xmath89.\\ ] ] the @xmath90 and @xmath91 are results of the integrations in eq.([k9 ] ) .",
    "the radius @xmath92 reflects the range of final state interactions and is expected to be close to the @xmath5he radius .",
    "formula ( [ k10 ] ) contains effects from all the channels characterised by high intermediate momenta i.e. all @xmath0-matrix elements other than @xmath93 or @xmath94 , which have already been specified explicitly .",
    "now , we show that the other matrix elements are small . some will be needed only to the leading order , whereas others may be simply neglected . to do this",
    "we resort to the experimental data .",
    "the saturne cross section , @xcite , for the @xmath1 @xmath2he @xmath3 reaction is given by @xmath95 of eq .",
    "( [ k2 ] ) .",
    "these data , given in fig .",
    "[ petafit . ] , fix @xmath96 rather precisely to the value of @xmath97 fm . on the other hand , provided @xmath98 , there is a whole region of @xmath99 and @xmath100 values that are equally likely .",
    "for example , the modulus of eq.([k2 ] ) is invariant with respect to the sign change @xmath101 .",
    "these two possibilities describe different physics .",
    "large positive values of @xmath102 correspond to a virtual state , an analogue of the nn spin 0 state at low energies and the singularity of the scattering matrix given by eq.([k7 ] ) is located in the third quadrant of the complex @xmath88 plane .",
    "the other option , a negative length , signifies a quasi - bound state , which is analogous to the deuteron .",
    "one sees that the formation cross section can not distinguish between these two possibilities .    the brookhaven data , for the @xmath8 @xmath5h@xmath6 @xmath5he @xmath3 process",
    ", @xcite , permits one to extract two small @xmath0-matrix elements .",
    "these data are described by the amplitude @xmath103 giving @xmath104 fm , a value that depends only slightly on the choice of @xmath105 .",
    "the coupling of @xmath5he@xmath3 to @xmath5he(@xmath5h)@xmath11 is rather weak , and an inspection of eq.([k3 ] ) tells us that its contribution to im@xmath94 is quite small .",
    "therefore , the brookhaven experiment implies that the @xmath10he state decays mainly into three- or four - body systems .",
    "now , both @xmath3 formation experiments permit a simple description of the two body channels .",
    "since it is well established that low energy @xmath106 physics is dominated by the @xmath107 resonance we extend this dominance to few body systems .",
    "thus the channel coupling is given by @xmath108 where the @xmath109 couple the resonance to the meson - nucleon channels , @xmath110 denotes a suitable average of the resonance propagator over the binding and recoil energies and the @xmath111 are the form factors for the meson-@xmath5he ( @xmath5h ) systems .",
    "the latter are expected to be about unity in the @xmath112 channel and small in the @xmath11 channels due to the high momenta involved .",
    "the ratio @xmath113 may be extracted from @xmath107 decay .",
    "next , eq.([k12 ] )  when combined with the @xmath114 data  yield @xmath115 fm , a negligible value .",
    "there is another consequence of eq.([k12 ] ) , the phase of @xmath116 is given by the phase of the @xmath107 propagator .",
    "for low energy @xmath10he scattering , the relevant energies in the meson - nucleon system fall well below the resonance .",
    "therefore , the dominant mode of decay is closed and @xmath116 is almost real .",
    "the uncertainty in the relative sign in the coupling constants @xmath117 and @xmath118 may be removed by the @xmath107 state wave function , where the su(3 ) coupling mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite gives a positive sign for @xmath119 .",
    "we are now ready to study the @xmath7 @xmath120 reaction , @xcite . given a small value of @xmath119 , alongwith a negligible @xmath121 , then eqs .",
    "( [ k5 ] , [ k6 ] ) and the experimental data from ref .",
    "@xcite yield a crude estimate of @xmath122 fm .",
    "the data used consists of 8 measurements of the @xmath2he@xmath112 cross section in the threshold region @xcite , 4 measurements of the @xmath5h@xmath123 cross section @xcite , 4 measurements of the @xmath2he@xmath124 cross section @xcite , and one result for the @xmath8 @xmath5h@xmath6 @xmath5he @xmath3 reaction @xcite .",
    "we limit the available data to the low energy @xmath86 region to stay with the approximation of a constant @xmath0-matrix .",
    "the first two reactions yield absolute values of the @xmath125 and @xmath126 matrix elements . however , the relative phase of these has to be left to an experimental determination .",
    "we set @xmath127 where @xmath128 is well determined from the @xmath129 and @xmath123 formation experiments .",
    "the phase @xmath83 and the @xmath3-@xmath11 mixing angle @xmath130 are free parameters . to elucidate the interference pattern in the equations of the previous section ,",
    "the @xmath11 formation amplitudes are now presented in a simplified form .",
    "forgetting an irrelevant overall phase , up to terms linear in small @xmath131 one has @xmath132\\ ] ] @xmath133.\\ ] ] in these equations the two @xmath0-matrix parameters are real .",
    "a positive sign for @xmath134 is preferred by the @xmath107 dominance and also by the best fit to the experimental data .    using the * minuit * minimization package , an overall best fit search to the data yields :    @xmath135 fm , @xmath136 fm , @xmath137 fm , @xmath138 ,    @xmath139 fm , @xmath140 fm ,    @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the small difference between @xmath143 and @xmath144 is due to the explicit inclusion of @xmath131 .",
    "as discussed in the last section , the large error in @xmath144 arises since the @xmath3 formation cross section is not restrictive on the values of @xmath145 .",
    "the real part of the @xmath2he @xmath86 scattering length is seen to be large and positive  signalling the existence of a virtual - state in this system .",
    "the idea behind the detection of @xmath3-@xmath11 mixing at cosy was to exploit the ratio of the charged and neutral pion cross sections @xmath146 , @xcite . according to isospin invariance , @xmath146 should equal 2 .",
    "however , the mixing induces corrections such that @xmath147 there is an additional reason for studying the ratio @xmath146 , rather than the separate cross sections , since in this way most of the systematic errors are removed . because of that we limit our discussion to the data obtained in one laboratory .",
    "the amplitudes obtained in the previous section and @xmath148 [ @xmath149 $ ] reproduce the trends in the measured values to a fair degree as is shown in table  [ table1 ] and fig .  [ ratio ] . in the latter , as a crude attempt to estimate systematic errors in the two measured cross sections , the effect of doubling the experimental error bars is shown as a dashed line .",
    "this is seen to have a minor effect .",
    "the data and overall fit from the model display a maximum just above the @xmath3-threshold .",
    "however , in the data a minimum below the threshold is also indicated , but it is not reproduced here . for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ pi0xsection ] , the @xmath1 @xmath150 cross section calculated with a mixing angle of @xmath151 is plotted against the experimental results @xcite .    the last step in this analysis has been a more detailed extraction of the @xmath3-@xmath11 mixing parameter @xmath130 .",
    "notice that eqs.([k14 ] ) and ( [ k15 ] ) , which are essential for that procedure , have a very simple structure at the threshold , @xmath152 .",
    "this point determines the unknown phase @xmath153 .",
    "we find two basic solutions that differ by the sign of @xmath130 , where the negative sign is ruled out on physical grounds .",
    "the actual value of @xmath130 is then extracted by the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath146 and the energy independence in @xmath154 below the threshold indicated in table i. however , the best fit parameters are not well determined and their errors are large .",
    "the need for more precise and more numerous data is evident .",
    "the value of the mixing parameter obtained here is smaller than the @xmath155 extracted from the @xmath156 reaction , @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations yield values in the region of @xmath157 @xcite - @xcite , although angles twice as large have also been suggested , @xcite .",
    "so far we have assumed that all the isospin violation is due to the @xmath3-@xmath11 mixing . however , there are other sources of such a violation .",
    "these can enter in two ways .",
    "* the two reactions @xmath7 @xmath5h@xmath8 and @xmath1 @xmath5he@xmath14 need not be exactly in the ratio 2 to 1 as is assumed in eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) , since they contain explicit isospin violation effects such as the difference between the @xmath5he and @xmath5h nuclear wavefunctions , coulomb interactions and different meson momenta .",
    "this effect is analysed in terms of an additional free parameter @xmath158 , by assuming @xmath159 to be @xmath160 .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath161 is found to improve our @xmath146 ratio in fig .",
    "3 . in this way",
    ", the mixing parameter is reduced to @xmath162 .",
    "however , this procedure uses a very limited data base .",
    "an extension of the data could possibly lead to a different value of @xmath158 .",
    "+ on the other hand qualitative theoretical arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite do seem to suggest a value of @xmath163 that is greater than unity ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "one conclusion from this type of overall renormalisation is that the error in @xmath130 could well be larger .",
    "* an additional isospin violation effect in the @xmath1 @xmath2he@xmath3 reaction could also arise from @xmath165-@xmath166 mixing .",
    "however , since our approach is based on phenomenological @xmath0-matrix parameters such an effect would not change directly the present determination of @xmath130 .",
    "presumably this would contribute to an overall normalisation correction and so is taken into account by the above @xmath158 correction .",
    "the conclusion is that , eventhough these two effects could be at a 10% level , they do not lead to any dramatic effect at the @xmath3- threshold and so are incorporated in the multiplicative factor @xmath158 .",
    "in addition to the above corrections , it should be remembered that eq .",
    "(  [ t1 ] ) is written down for s - waves under the assumption that these dominate in the backward scattering , whereas a more correct expression would involve the effect of higher partial waves .",
    "that possibility was incorporated by simply adding an additional `` background '' contribution as a complex constant ( @xmath167 ) to @xmath168 .",
    "however , the best fit procedure indicated that @xmath167 was very small and so ruled out any significant contribution of this kind .",
    "the @xmath169matrix formalism developed here is able to account for the structure seen at the @xmath3-threshold in the experimental ratio @xmath159 as a manifestation of @xmath3-@xmath11 mixing .",
    "it also enables an estimate of 0.010(5 ) to be made of the mixing angle .",
    "unfortunately , at present this estimate has a large uncertainty , which could be significantly reduced by the removal of several uncertain systematic effects in the available experimental data .",
    "this clearly exposes the need for more precise data over the energy range covering the @xmath3-threshold .",
    "such data should be detailed within the range @xmath170= 1.55  1.59 gev .",
