    "the presence of a softening branch of the stress - strain curve , usually caused by initiation , propagation and coalescence of defects such as micro - cracks or micro - voids , is a phenomenon typical of quasi - brittle materials .",
    "softening often leads to localization of strain into narrow bands whose width is related to an intrinsic length dictated by the heterogeneities of the material microstructure .",
    "softening can be conveniently incorporated into damage models , but can also be described by plasticity with a negative hardening modulus .",
    "however , constitutive models within the classical continuum framework of simple materials do not contain any length scale reflecting the typical size of microstructural features .",
    "therefore , the localization processes due to softening are not described properly and mathematical models lead to ill - posed problems accompanied by localization of strain into subdomains of zero volume and consequently to vanishing dissipation .",
    "various enrichments incorporating some information about the material heterogeneity have been developed .",
    "they utilize , for example , additional kinematic variables , weighted spatial averages , higher - order gradients , or rate - dependent terms ; see e.g.  the comparative studies and review papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these techniques on the one hand preclude localization and loss of ellipticity of the governing equations , but on the other hand significantly complicate the overall analysis .",
    "for instance , in the case of higher - order gradient models , the regularity conditions of internal variables at the evolving elasto - plastic interface are not easy to characterize .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the investigation of the aifantis explicit fourth - order gradient plasticity model , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite or  @xcite , under conditions leading to non - uniform stress fields . to keep the analysis transparent , we confine ourselves to one - dimensional tension tests and perform our analysis in the framework of the so - called energetic solutions introduced in an abstract setting in  @xcite and in the context of finite - strain plasticity in  @xcite , generalizing earlier variational formulations of damage  @xcite and fracture  @xcite .",
    "building on this basis , we will derive the governing equations and appropriate boundary and jump conditions .",
    "in particular , the often questioned regularity conditions for internal variables at the elasto - plastic interface will emerge naturally in a consistent and unified way .",
    "detailed solutions for four different test problems with various regularity of the yield stress and stress distributions will be presented and compared to results obtained from the standard non - variational gradient formulation available in  @xcite .",
    "the present work can also be viewed as a continuation and extension of results provided in our previous paper  @xcite , where the second - order gradient plasticity model was investigated .",
    "the main difference from our previous work is that now we treat a more complicated model with higher - order regularity requirements on internal variables and more intricate conditions at the elasto - plastic interface .",
    "in addition , we approach the problem utilizing the nowadays standard variational framework for rate - independent evolution .",
    "this study is also closely related to several one - dimensional studies into energy - based second - order gradient models of strain - softening damage and plasticity .",
    "in particular , @xcite performed a detailed analysis of stability and bifurcation of localized and homogenous states , obtained in the closed form , for a parameterized family of gradient damage models .",
    "these results were later refined by  @xcite , who studied size effects and snap - back behaviour at the structural scale predicted by the same group of damage models .",
    "the combination of damage and plasticity has been the subject of recent contributions by @xcite and  @xcite , with the emphasis on the competition between brittle and ductile failure ; the former work , as well as  @xcite , also contain a validation against experimental data .",
    "theoretical results of fracture and plasticity as @xmath0-limits of damage models within one - dimensional setting are described in  @xcite , and non - local damage or fracture analyses in bars under tension are discussed in  @xcite and @xcite ; all these works also employ a variational formulation .",
    "our analysis extends these contributions by treating a model regularized by the fourth derivative of internal variables and by deriving the regularity of internal variables directly from energy - minimization arguments , rather than enforcing them through additional boundary conditions at the moving elastic - inelastic interfaces .",
    "the energetic formulation for rate - independent processes comprises several steps and relies on two principles . in the abstract",
    "setting  @xcite , the state of the system within a fixed time horizon  @xmath1 is described in terms of a `` non - dissipative '' field  @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where  @xmath5 denotes the spatial domain , and a  `` dissipative '' field  @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which specifies the irreversible processes at time  @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the state of the system is fully characterized by the state variables  @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "typically , @xmath11 is the displacement field and @xmath12 is the field of internal variables related to the inelastic phenomena , such as plastic strain or damage .",
    "further , we consider the total free ( helmholtz ) energy of the body  @xmath13\\times\\mathcal{q}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}\\cup\\{+\\infty\\}$ ] together with the dissipation distance  @xmath14 which specifies the minimum amount of energy spent by the continuous transition from state  @xmath15 to state  @xmath16 . for notational convenience",
    ", we will sometimes refer to the dissipation distance by @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 .",
    "then , the process  @xmath19\\rightarrow\\mathcal{q}$ ] is an energetic solution to the initial - value problem described by  @xmath20 if it satisfies    a.   * global stability : * for all  @xmath8 $ ] and for all @xmath21 @xmath22 which ensures that the solution minimizes the sum  @xmath23 , b.   * energy equality : * for all @xmath8 $ ] @xmath24 which expresses energy balance in terms of the internal energy , dissipated energy  @xmath25 , and time - integrated power of external forces  @xmath26 , c.   * initial condition : * @xmath27    the dissipation along a process  @xmath28 is expressed as @xmath29 where the supremum is taken over all  @xmath30 and all partitions of the time interval  @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 .",
    "together , the two principles   and   along with initial condition   naturally give rise to an * incremental problem : * for @xmath33 @xmath34 \\tag{ip } \\label{sect:1:eq : ip}\\ ] ] amenable to a numerical solution , in which each step is realized as a minimization problem , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the main conceptual difficulty with this incremental problem is that it represents a global minimization , which is computationally cumbersome and physically difficult to justify for non - convex energies .",
    "it is reasonable , however , to assume that stable solutions to   are associated with local minima ; for comparative studies into evolution driven by local and global energy minimization see e.g.  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the variational approach offers many advantages , among which we highlight that it provides a unified setting for the analysis , allows for discontinuities in space , incorporates the governing laws with boundary conditions and provides regularity conditions at the elasto - plastic interface .    for the uniaxial displacement - controlled tension test",
    ", we can further specify all the quantities introduced above in more detail .",
    "displacement  @xmath35 , where we have used the light face letter since  @xmath36 is now a scalar field , as a function of the spatial coordinate  @xmath37 , represents the `` non - dissipative '' component ; the total linearized strain is simply the spatial derivative  @xmath38 .",
    "the `` dissipative '' variables , describing the irreversible processes , are plastic strain  @xmath39 and cumulative plastic strain  @xmath40 , i.e.  @xmath41 . , where  @xmath42 denotes a primitive integral of a function  @xmath43 .",
    "since such an affine transformation does not affect the solution , we adopt  @xmath36 instead of  @xmath44 as our primal variable in further considerations for convenience . ]",
    "the corresponding function spaces are as follows :    [ sect:1:eq:2 ] @xmath45    where  @xmath46 denotes prescribed displacements on the boundary ( specifying the dirichlet boundary condition ) and  @xmath47 stands for the space of all lebesgue square - integrable functions with square - integrable generalized derivatives up to order  @xmath48 ; later on , we will employ a subset  @xmath49 consisting of functions vanishing at the boundary , for details we refer to e.g.  @xcite . consequently , we identify  @xmath50 , which now depends on time ( due to the time - dependent values presented on the boundary ) , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and define the total free energy of the body @xmath53 and the dissipation distance @xmath54 quantities appearing in the definitions of energies represent the young modulus  @xmath55  [ pa ] , softening modulus  @xmath56  [ pa ] , characteristic length of the material  @xmath57  [ m ] , initial yield stress  @xmath58  [ pa ] , a function describing the distribution of the cross - sectional area along the bar  @xmath59  [ m@xmath60 , and prescribed body force density  @xmath61  [ n / m@xmath62 . for completeness ,",
    "let us note that the power of external forces in   has the form  @xmath63 , where  @xmath64 denotes the reaction force as a function of time and the dot stands for the time derivative .",

    "in addition to conditions  , which have been deduced as optimality conditions following from the first two lines of  , the last two lines of   provide us with boundary and regularity conditions for the plastic strain .",
    "let us first discuss the * boundary conditions*. again , we have to distinguish between the plastic part of the physical boundary , @xmath116 , and the elastic part , @xmath117 .    1 .",
    "* boundary point in a plastic state * , characterized by @xmath118 : + the variation @xmath81 as well as its derivative @xmath119 at such a point can have an arbitrary sign and the terms that multiply them must vanish .",

    "therefore , for a boundary point in an elastic state we obtain the inequality condition @xmath122 .",
    "recall that @xmath123 at the left boundary and @xmath124 at the right boundary . regarding the second condition , tested by the derivative of the variation of plastic strain",
    ", we have to distinguish the following two subcases : 1 .",
    "nonzero derivative of plastic strain at the boundary : + if @xmath110 and @xmath125 at a boundary point ( which necessarily means @xmath126 at the left boundary and @xmath127 at the right boundary , by virtue of the universally valid admissibility condition @xmath128 ) , then the variation of plastic strain , @xmath119 , has an arbitrary sign , and the term @xmath129 that multiplies @xmath119 in the first sum in the fourth line   must vanish .",
    "since @xmath130 , this gives the boundary condition @xmath120 .",
    "zero derivative of plastic strain at the boundary : + if @xmath110 and @xmath131 at a boundary point , then the derivative of the variation of plastic strain , @xmath119 , can be positive at the left boundary and negative at the right boundary , which means that @xmath132 can be negative .",
    "consequently , the term @xmath133 that multiplies @xmath132 in the first sum in the fourth line   must not be negative ( note the minus sign before the sum ) . since @xmath56 and @xmath134 , the resulting condition reads @xmath135 .",
    "but this actually can not be satisfied as a strict inequality , because @xmath136 in combination with @xmath110 and @xmath131 would lead to a violation of the admissibility condition @xmath128 in the near vicinity of the boundary point .",
    "so once again , we conclude that @xmath137 must vanish .",
    "we have found that the boundary condition @xmath120 applies independently of the state of the material at the boundary . on top of that , we have @xmath121 and @xmath118 if the boundary point is in a plastic state , and @xmath122 and @xmath110 if the boundary point is in an elastic state .",
    "all this can be summarized by the following boundary conditions : @xmath138    let us now turn our attention to the * continuity or regularity conditions * that can be deduced from the jump terms in the last two lines of .",
    "again , in the * plastic domain * the variation of plastic strain and its derivative have arbitrary signs and remain continuous , and so the jumps in @xmath133 and in @xmath139 must vanish .",
    "in other words , continuity of these terms must be preserved . note that @xmath72 and @xmath140 are continuous by assumption , but continuity of @xmath137 or @xmath141 is not assumed apriori , and in fact is not maintained at points where for instance @xmath142 or @xmath143 have a jump .    inside the * elastic domain * ,",
    "the plastic strain is identically zero and thus all its derivatives are zero , too , which means that the corresponding jump terms in the last two lines of automatically vanish .",
    "however , special attention should be paid to those points of the boundary of the elastic domain which at the same time belong to the closure of the plastic domain ( recall that the plastic domain is an open set ) , i.e. , to the points of the * elastoplastic interface * , formally defined as @xmath144 .",
    "since these are not internal points of @xmath107 , we can not directly infer that all derivatives of @xmath72 vanish here .",
    "continuous differentiability of @xmath72 implies that @xmath110 and @xmath131 at @xmath145 , but higher derivatives could in principle exhibit a jump .",
    "so it is necessary to examine again the corresponding jump terms in .",
    "the variation @xmath81 at @xmath145 can be zero or positive , but never negative .",
    "therefore , the resulting optimality condition is the inequality @xmath146 .",
    "the last condition to be derived is the most delicate one .",
    "the derivative of the variation of plastic strain , @xmath119 , can not be set to a nonzero value at a point of @xmath145 without simultaneously prescribing a positive value of @xmath81 , otherwise the admissibility condition @xmath147 would be violated in the vicinity of that point .",
    "still , various combinations of @xmath81 and @xmath119 can be selected such that the latter becomes increasingly `` more important '' and the jump term with @xmath81 , which could potentially compensate for the negative contribution of the jump term with @xmath119 , becomes negligible .",
    "this argument leads to the conclusion that the jump term with @xmath119 must vanish , i.e. , @xmath133 must remain continuous .",
    "since @xmath110 in @xmath107 and @xmath148 , we must have @xmath120 at @xmath145 . to avoid any doubt that this optimality condition is necessary , it is demonstrated in  [ sect : b ] that if the potential solutions of the localization problem are constructed with the condition @xmath120 at @xmath145 relaxed and then the minimum principle is imposed , the resulting optimum solution is the same as that constructed directly , with condition @xmath120 at @xmath145 explicitly imposed .    for clarity and completeness , we compare the governing equations , boundary conditions , and regularity conditions for internal variable  @xmath72 and the two different formulations in tab .",

    "we have derived the description of a one - dimensional gradient plasticity model which provides not only the appropriate differential equation , representing the yield condition inside the plastic zone , but also appropriate forms of boundary and jump conditions at the elasto - plastic interface .",
    "2 .   on the basis of the derived conditions that follow from the variational principle , two problems with discontinuous data ( a bar or layer with discontinuous yield stress and a bar with discontinuous cross - sectional area ) have been investigated .",
    "these examples are amenable to analytical solution and have provided physically reasonable results .",
    "two additional examples have been analysed , one with continuous but not continuously differentiable data and the other with smooth data .",
    "numerical solutions have been constructed and compared to the alternative non - variational formulation , demonstrating that the variationally consistent formulation leads to higher peak loads and elongations at structural failure .",
    "we have also investigated the influence of various data on the evolution of the plastic zone and on load - displacement diagrams for all four prototype problems .",
    "it has been shown that the plastic zone monotonically expands from the weakest section of the bar . in spite of the softening character of the material model , the structural response exhibits first hardening after the onset of yielding , later followed by softening .",
    "such a behaviour is related to a gradual expansion of the plastic zone to stronger segments of the bar .",
    "further , it has been demonstrated that the solution corresponding to the variational formulation satisfies the energy balance along the evolution path of the localization process .",
    "contrary to that , the standard formulation exhibits systematic lack of balance in the sense that the sum of elastic and dissipated energies exceeds the work done by external forces . in all cases ,",
    "however , the dissipated energy remains finite and non - zero .",
    "the variational approach is based on the non - negative first variation of the functional .",
    "solutions corresponding to local minima of the functional have to satisfy this condition and moreover have to be stable .",
    "hence , an analysis of the second variation providing some explicit requirements on physical constants is presented in  [ sect : a ] for the simplest case of a bar with perfectly uniform data .",
    "let us note that although we have not employed variable elastic or plastic moduli , the variational approach is perfectly suited to handle problems with discontinuities in such data .",
    "the presented framework can also be extended to higher dimensions using e.g.  the von mises yield function with isotropic softening .",
    "then , the free boundary conditions for the scalar cumulative plastic strain at the elastoplastic interface are analogous to those for  @xmath72 for sufficiently smooth fields only . however , in the multi - dimensional setting the required regularity is difficult to establish since , for instance , the embeddings  @xmath233 or  @xmath234 no longer hold ; its rigorous investigation is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the analysis presented in the main part of the paper has been based on the condition of non - negative first variation of the energy functional  @xmath78 .",
    "this condition is , however , only a necessary one , yet is not sufficient to ensure that the solution is a local minimum , thus that it is energetically stable .",
    "therefore , in this section we discuss the behaviour of the energy functional in the vicinity of a solution  @xmath235 satisfying   , drawing inspiration from a related analysis by  @xcite .    in particular , we will investigate the second variation of the energy functional given by eq .  .",
    "our objective is to show that the second variation is positive for all those nonzero admissible variations  @xmath236 and  @xmath81 for which the first variation  @xmath237 vanishes , to ensure that the solution  @xmath235 is stable .",
    "overall procedure will be described in six steps for better clarity . in  [ subsect : a.1 ] , we start with the elimination of the displacement field from the functional  @xmath78 in order to simplify stability conditions discussed in  [ subsect : a.2 ] , where the corresponding eigenvalue problem will be derived . in",

    ", we can simplify the problem by eliminating the displacement field and constructing a reduced functional that depends on the plastic strain field only .",

    "the second variation of the reduced functional  @xmath247 is given by @xmath250 and is independent of  @xmath72 because  @xmath247 is quadratic .",
    "we would now like to prove that the quadratic form  @xmath251 is positive definite in the space of all those admissible variations  @xmath81 for which  @xmath252 .",
    "note that  @xmath72 is not arbitrary but represents the solution of the problem described by conditions   , which were derived from the requirement  @xmath253 for all admissible variations  @xmath80 and  @xmath81 ( and which could alternatively be derived , in a slightly different format , from the condition  @xmath254 for all admissible variations  @xmath81 ) . integrating the term with  @xmath255 in   twice by parts and exploiting the properties of function  @xmath72 ( in particular , the fact that  @xmath110 in  @xmath107 ) , we can rewrite the first variation of  @xmath247 as @xmath256\\delta\\kappa\\,\\mbox{d}x\\\\ \\nonumber & & + \\int_{\\mathcal{i}_e } \\left[a\\sigma_0-k_e\\left(\\overline{u } - \\int_{\\mathcal{i}_p}{\\kappa}\\,\\mbox{d}x\\right)\\right]\\delta\\kappa\\,\\mbox{d}x\\\\ & & -\\sum_{\\partial\\mathcal{i}_{ep}}hal^4\\kappa''n\\delta\\kappa'+\\sum_{\\partial\\mathcal{i}_{ep}}(hal^4\\kappa'')'n\\delta\\kappa \\label{mj13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath86 denotes the outer normal to  @xmath106 .",

    "to proceed further , we need to assume that the expression in the square brackets in   is strictly positive ( not just nonnegative ) in  @xmath107 .",
    "this assumption means that the normal force in the entire elastic domain is below the yield limit , which is true for all the localized solutions presented in this paper .",
