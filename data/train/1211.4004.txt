    "the first results on the mass and decay rates of the higgs - like particle observed by atlas and cms at the lhc @xcite already imply some significant bounds on the parameters of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , once we interpret the newly discovered particle as the lightest @xmath4 state in this theory .",
    "new results for the properties of this particle have just been presented by the atlas and cms experiments with up to 17  fb@xmath0 of 7 and 8  tev data @xcite .",
    "new results on the search for tau lepton pairs at high invariant masses reported by the cms collaboration @xcite set tighter constraints on heavier higgs particles . on another front",
    "the lhcb collaboration has obtained the first observation of the @xmath5 rare decay and reported a first determination of its decay branching fraction @xcite .",
    "constraints on weakly interacting dark matter particles have also been significantly improved since the higgs - like particle discovery with the updated results on the direct search by the xenon collaboration @xcite .",
    "all these new data have a drastic impact not only on the sm but also on theories of supersymmetry and in particular the mssm .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a detailed analysis of the implications of the observation of a higgs - like particle and the first determination of its properties .",
    "there , we refined a previous study @xcite of the implications of the value @xmath6 gev for both the constrained and unconstrained versions of the mssm and analysed the impact of the first data for the newly observed particle . by reviewing the different regimes of the mssm",
    ", we concluded that two of those exhibited the best agreement with its properties : i ) the decoupling regime in which the @xmath4 boson has sm - like properties with the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 bosons being heavy and decoupled from the gauge bosons and ii ) a regime where light susy particles such as tau  sleptons , charginos and third generation scalar quarks affected the @xmath4 boson rates , in particular in the @xmath10 channel .",
    "the study presented in this paper updates that work with a focus on the regions of pmssm parameters allowed , and favoured , by the latest lhc higgs data and other results .",
    "we evaluate the constraints obtained in the framework of the phenomenological mssm ( pmssm ) , with the neutralino as the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , with 19 free parameters using flat parameter scans .",
    "our analysis tests the compatibility of a large sample of generated pmssm points , fulfilling the constraints from other mssm searches at lep and the lhc , flavour physics data and dark matter searches and the direct searches for supersymmetric particles in channels with missing transverse energy at the lhc .",
    "the qualitative results of our previous study  @xcite stay the same , and are even strengthened ; there are quantitative changes which make this update interesting . while the statistical accuracy of the lhc results is still limited and",
    "the data have not settled , we expect a steady improvement with the analysis of the full statistics collected in the 8  tev run and then with higher energy lhc operation from 2014 .",
    "the present study provides conclusions which are already a useful guidance for the current susy searches at the lhc and it defines a template for further analyses , once results with better precision will be available .",
    "the essential elements of the pmssm scans with the various constraints and the relevant ranges for the variation of its parameters have been already presented in ref .",
    "the tools used to perform our analysis given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we proceed to the presentation of our updated analysis and its results in the next section .",
    "section  3 has a short conclusion .",
    "the analysis is based on the latest results for the mass of the new higgs  like particle and its signal strengths in the individual channels .",
    "we use a weighted average of the results reported by the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc and also cdf and d0 at the tevatron @xcite with their estimated statistical uncertainties , as summarised in table  [ tab : input ] . in the following ,",
    "we use the notation @xmath11 to indicate the ratio of the @xmath4 branching fraction to the final state @xmath12 , br(@xmath13 ) , to its sm value .",
    "then , we compute the so - called `` signal strengths '' , _ i.e. _ the ratios of the products of production cross sections times decay branching fractions for the pmssm points to their sm values , which we denote with @xmath14 for a given @xmath15 channel , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the relevant production cross section .    the signal strengths corresponding to each accepted pmssm point are compared to their experimental values .",
    "both atlas and cms have provided updates for the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath2 and @xmath20 channels with the full 7  tev statistics of 4.7  fb@xmath0 and @xmath21  13  fb@xmath0 of the 8  tev data .",
    "atlas has also updated the result for the @xmath22 channel based on 4.8 + 13  fb@xmath0 .",
    "these updates result in improved determinations of the signal strengths in the @xmath22 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 channel and data from both lhc experiments in the important @xmath2 and @xmath20 channels .",
    "we also include the combined tevatron result for the @xmath23 channel . while these results are compatible with the sm expectations , or the mssm in the decoupling regime with heavy susy particles , within their present accuracy , the situation with the data for most of the channels does not appear to have settled .",
    "after the atlas update , the results for the @xmath22 channel hint more significantly to a possible enhancement of its rate , but a confirmation from cms with the larger 8  tev data set would be comforting .",
    "results on the @xmath19 and @xmath18 yields are aligned at values which are consistently about 1@xmath17 above the sm expectation for atlas and 1@xmath17 below it for cms .",
    "the important , but experimentally difficult , @xmath2 channel still requires more data and a careful control of the sm backgrounds . at present",
    ", the spread of the experimental results by atlas and cms , covers the range of values predicted by the mssm , as we highlight in figure  [ fig : mu ] .",
    ".input values for the higgs mass and rates used for the study .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another possibility leading to the suppression of the @xmath24 rate is when the decay channels into susy particles are kinematically accessible .",
    "this is particularly important in the case of the decays @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( because of cp invariance the @xmath9 boson can not decay into two sfermions of the same nature ) and to a lesser extent @xmath27 and @xmath28 which can be significant for not too large values of @xmath29 for which the total @xmath30 widths are not too strongly enhanced .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : h ] where the points having a branching fraction br@xmath31 larger than 15% are displayed in the plane @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "this is typically the area in which we have light staus with large couplings to the higgs , yielding also an enhancement of @xmath33 .",
    "the branching fractions into charginos and neutralinos are less significant even for @xmath34 $ \\sim$}}~}10 $ ] .",
    "the invisible decays @xmath35 have more phase space , but the rate is generally small as the lsp has to be bino  like if is light enough and it thus couples only weakly to the higgs bosons ( figure  [ fig : h ] ) .      finally , we should note that the higgs data have also an impact on direct dark matter searches , which are now starting to probe the bulk of the region of the neutralino - nucleon scattering cross section predicted by the mssm .",
    "in particular , the latest results reported by the xenon collaboration improved the earlier 95% c.l .",
    "limit by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "-@xmath37 scattering cross section as a function of the @xmath38 mass .",
    "the black dots represent valid pmssm points , the dark grey dots the subset of points compatible at 90% c.l . with the lhc higgs results and the light grey dots compatible at 68% c.l .",
    "the region enclosed by the grey continuous line contains 99.5% of the points",
    "compatible at 90% c.l . with the lhc higgs results .",
    "the dashed line represents the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit contour set by the xenon100 experiment with 225 live days of data.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    we compare the new xenon limit with the predicted spin ",
    "independent @xmath39@xmath37 cross sections as a function of the lsp mass for the points fulfilling various selections in figure  [ fig : dd ] .",
    "the xenon limit removes 28% of the accepted mssm points before the constraints from the lhc higgs results are applied .",
    "this fraction decreases to 24% and 15% when we restrict to the points compatible with the measured higgs mass and rates at , respectively , the 90% and 68% c.l .",
    "this indicates that the pmssm points favoured by the lhc higgs results , tend to have a lower @xmath39@xmath37 scattering cross section , as a result of the large value of @xmath40 that they imply .",
    "in this paper , we have updated the study of the phenomenological mssm performed in ref .",
    "@xcite by including the new experimental data recently released .",
    "we performed a @xmath41 probability analysis based on a sample of @xmath42 generated pmssm points and presented the regions of the relevant mssm parameters which show agreement at the 68% and 90% c.l . with the updated lhc results .",
    "the new , and more precise , atlas and cms data for the decay channels @xmath10 , @xmath43 , @xmath18 , @xmath2 and @xmath44 , the updated cms constraints from the @xmath45 search mode , and the new lhcb result for the @xmath46 decay branching fraction have a significant impact on the pmssm parameter space .",
    "our earlier results stay qualitatively the same and are even strengthened . in particular , we have shown that the possibility of being outside the decoupling regime for the mssm higgs sector by , for instance , allowing the heavier cp  even @xmath7 state to be the observed higgs particle , is now being ruled out .",
    "the scenario in which the total @xmath4 boson decay width is suppressed , in particular when the @xmath47 coupling is not sm  like even for @xmath48 , which enhances the branching fractions for some of the channels still plays a role in view of the increased statistical significance of a possible enhancement in the rate of the @xmath49 decay channel .",
    "this also suggests the possibility of some light supersymmetric particles , such as staus , charginos and third generation squarks , contributing to the @xmath50 loop - induced vertex . nevertheless , for not too extreme choices of the pmssm parameters , we find that the contributions of the susy particles to the @xmath33 branching fraction should not exceed , in general , the @xmath51 level .",
