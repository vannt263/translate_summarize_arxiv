    "the role of sequential resonant - tunneling ( rt ) in semiconductor quantum - wells for charge transport  @xcite as well as light amplification  @xcite has been discussed since the early 1970s .",
    "subsequently , multiple proposals were introduced in the 1980s to predict intersubband lasing in semiconductor superlattice structures . with the advent of a unique rt based charge injection scheme , a unipolar mid - infrared ( ir ) intersubband",
    "laser , the so - called quantum - cascade laser ( qcl ) , was first demonstrated in 1994  @xcite .",
    "mid - ir qcls have since undergone rapid progress and room - temperature continuous - wave operation is now obtained over the spectrum .",
    "based on similar design principles , the operating frequency range of these devices has also been extended to terahertz frequencies ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "however , due to additional challenges associated with the charge transport in these low - frequency devices , terahertz qcls are still required to be cryogenically cooled  @xcite .",
    "it then becomes increasingly important to better understand the transport processes in terahertz qcls to improve the existing designs , with a goal to ultimately achieve room - temperature operation .",
    "the best temperature performance for terahertz qcls is obtained with the resonant - phonon ( rp ) designs  @xcite , and operation up to @xmath2 without magnetic field  @xcite , and @xmath3 with magnetic field  @xcite has been demonstrated . for qcls , almost universally across all different designs and operating frequencies , rt plays an important role in the electrical injection process to populate the upper radiative level  @xcite . for the resonant - phonon terahertz qcls ( rptqcls )",
    ", rt also plays an important role in the lower level depopulation .",
    "newer designs with rt based extraction have also been demonstrated recently achieving very low threshold current densities  @xcite .",
    "the radiative levels in a terahertz qcl have small energy separation in the range of @xmath4 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the potential barriers in the multiple quantum - well ( qw ) structure are therefore kept thick to obtain tightly - coupled levels in order to maintain selectivity of the injection as well as the depopulation processes .",
    "this makes the coupling energies ( as characterized by the anticrossing energy @xmath5 for the coupled levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) similar in value to the low - temperature energy level broadening , which is expected to be of the order of a few @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , the loss of coherence ( or dephasing ) in the rt process has a significant bearing on the electron transport across the barriers  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "simple density - matrix models are used to incorporate the important role of coherence in the rt transport of qcls .",
    "we consider the case of tight binding for intermodule transport , since the intermodule energy anticrossings @xmath5 are typically much smaller than the intramodule energy level separations , where each module can consist of one or more qws and the qcl structure is a periodic repetition of one or more such modules . in the first part of the paper , we use a density - matrix model similar to the 2-level model first proposed by kazarinov and suris  @xcite and then later also discussed in refs .   among others .",
    "we modify the model to extend to 3 levels to describe a qcl in a more general sense , and derive analytical expressions for current transport across the injector barrier both below and above the lasing threshold . despite the simplicity of the model",
    ", we can gain useful information about qcl operation from the derived results that includes information about the possible temperature degradation mechanisms in rptqcls .",
    "the results presented in this section are applicable to mid - ir qcls as well . in the second part of the paper",
    ", we use a similar model to estimate the optical gain spectrum of rptqcls .",
    "a coherent rt assisted depopulation process is stipulated to be the cause of broad gain bandwidths that are typically observed in these lasers  @xcite .",

    "an accurate estimation of the electrical transport characteristics of a qcl is quite challenging , and more so for a terahertz qcl .",
    "computationally intensive numerical techniques based on monte - carlo simulations  @xcite and nonequilibrium green s functions  @xcite have produced reasonably good results ; however , an accurate description of the temperature degradation mechanisms in terahertz qcls is still lacking .",
    "also , such computational techniques fall short of providing a good intuitive picture of qcl operation .",
    "hence , more often than not , analysis based on simple rate equations are used during the design process .",
    "the 3-level model presented in this section is a step toward developing a simpler transport model that still captures the nuances of qcl operation and also provides a better understanding of how various parameters affect its characteristics both below and above the lasing threshold .    for simplicity",
    "yet still captures the essentials , in what follows we discuss a 3-level qcl design with two wells per module as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3levcb ]  @xcite , in which level @xmath11 is the injector state , and the radiative transition is from level @xmath12 .",
    "even though typically qcl designs include many more levels per period , the results obtained here hold for the triplet of levels consisting of the injector level and the two radiative levels ( levels @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3levcb]b ) , regardless of a particular design , and including the mid - ir designs . due to the various intrasubband and intersubband scattering mechanisms that contribute to quantum transport , the electron wavepackets undergo dephasing , which manifests itself as broadening of the energy levels .",
    "the tunnel - coupling between the levels of the same module is strong , therefore , dephasing has a relatively negligible effect on the intramodule intersubband transport  @xcite .",
    "however , the intermodule transport across the injector barrier is critically affected by the dephasing time of the wavepackets since the @xmath14 tunneling time ( half of the inter - well _ rabi _ oscillation period @xmath15 ) is now longer and of the same order . to incorporate the role of coherence in the @xmath14 rt transport , we use density - matrix ( dm ) rate equations corresponding to the tightbinding basis states of fig .  [ fig:3levcb](b )  @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath16 dm for this basis set can be written as  @xcite @xmath17 -\\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\left [ \\bar{\\bar{h } } ' , { { \\bar{\\bar{\\rho}}}}_{(1',3,2 ) } \\right ] \\quad \\label{eq : dm3lev1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath18 includes various radiative and non - radiative perturbation potentials to the conduction - band potential @xmath19 . the advantage of writing the dms with the tightbinding basis of fig .",
    "[ fig:3levcb](b ) is two - fold .",
    "first , it allows inclusion of dephasing phenomenologically by means of decay of the coherences associated with levels @xmath11 and @xmath20 due to non - zero off - diagonal terms in @xmath19 corresponding to those levels .",
    "second , whereas the eigenstates of @xmath9 depend sensitively on the externally applied electrical bias because of coupling between spatially separated states , the chosen basis states remain more or less independent of the bias in the range of interest (  close to the `` design bias '' corresponding to the @xmath21 alignment ) , which keeps the form - factors for various intramodule scattering rate calculations approximately invariant of bias . in a first order approximation , we assume rt to be independent of the electron wavevector in the plane of the qws .",

    "<S> , we use a three - level density - matrix model to obtain useful analytical expressions for current transport through the injector barrier in a qcl . </S>",
    "<S> an expression for the slope discontinuity in the current - voltage characteristics at the lasing threshold is derived . </S>",
    "<S> this value is shown to be a direct measure of the population inversion at threshold , and contradicts the previously held belief of it being indicative of ratio of the laser level lifetimes . in the second part of the paper , we use density matrices to compute the gain spectrum for a resonant - phonon terahertz qcl design . </S>",
    "<S> the large anticrossing of the doublet of lower radiative levels is reflected in a broad gain linewidth due to a coherent rt assisted depopulation process . at certain bias conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the gain spectrum exhibits double peaks which is supported by experimental observations . </S>"
