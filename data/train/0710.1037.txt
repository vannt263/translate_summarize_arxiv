    "we introduce a new numerical method for solving high order linear spectral problems by shooting and matching .",
    "the numerical construction of pure - point spectra is important in determining the linear stability of coherent structures .",
    "examples of such structures are : ground and higher excited states of molecules in quantum chemistry ( johnson  @xcite , hutson  @xcite , gray and manopoulous  @xcite , manopoulous and gray  @xcite , chou and wyatt  @xcite , ledoux  @xcite , ledoux , van daele and vanden berghe  @xcite , ixaru  @xcite ) ; nonlinear travelling fronts in reaction - diffusion such as autocatalysis or combustion ( billingham and needham  @xcite , metcalf , merkin and scott  @xcite , doelman , gardner and kaper  @xcite , terman  @xcite , gubernov , mercer , sidhu and weber  @xcite ) ; nerve impulses ( alexander , gardner and jones  @xcite ) , neural waves ( coombes and owen  @xcite ) ; solitary waves or steady flows over compliant surfaces ( pego and weinstein  @xcite , alexander and sachs  @xcite , chang , demekhin and kopelevich  @xcite , kapitula and sandstede  @xcite , bridges , derks and gottwald  @xcite , allen  @xcite , allen and bridges  @xcite ) ; laser pulses ( swinton and elgin  @xcite ) ; nonlinear waves along elastic rods ( lafortune and lega  @xcite ) ; ionization fronts ( derks , ebert and meulenbroek  @xcite ) or spiral waves ( sandstede and scheel  @xcite ) .    for such problems the matching condition is typically a discriminant known as the evans function ( evans  @xcite , alexander , gardner and jones  @xcite ) or miss - distance function ( pryce  @xcite , greenberg and marletta  @xcite ) .",
    "it measures the degree of ( possibly transversal ) intersection of the stable and unstable solution subspaces satisfying the longitudinally separated far field boundary data .",
    "the stable subspace decays in the direction of wave propagation whilst the unstable subspace decays in the opposite direction .",
    "equivalently , the evans function is the determinant of the set of solution vectors spanning both subspaces . with this end - goal",
    "matching condition in mind , the problem boils down to how to numerically construct the solution subspaces in a robust fashion , as well as where to match longitudinally .",
    "this is especially difficult for large scale problems .",
    "these might either emerge from high order systems , or more specifically , we envisage the stability of nonlinear travelling waves with multi - dimensional structure ; for example wrinkled fronts travelling in a fixed longitudinal direction . the transverse structural information can be projected onto finite dimensional transverse basis , generating a large linear spectral problem posed on the one - dimensional longitudinal coefficient function set ( see ledoux , malham , niesen and thmmler  @xcite ) . hitherto such large problems could not be solved by shooting and matching and were resolved by projecting the whole problem onto a finite basis and solving the resulting large algebraic eigenvalue problem .",
    "however recently , in the context of the evans function , humpherys and zumbrun  @xcite proposed continuous orthogonalization as a viable approach to help make large scale problems amenable to shooting and matching .",
    "here we provide our own answer .",
    "we propose the _ new _ grassmann gaussian elimination method ( ggem ) which resolves several numerical problems all in one , in particular it :    1 .",
    "evolves the solution along the underlying grassmann manifold avoiding representation singularities .",
    "2 .   retains analyticity in the spectral parameter .",
    "3 .   allows for matching anywhere in the longitudinal computational domain .",
    "4 .   has polynomial complexity , operations are of the order of the size of the system cubed .",
    "5 .   naturally evolves the solution in what in practice is the optimal coordinate representation ( generated by optimal partial pivoting ) .    for each property",
    "what is new , expected , proved , numerically observed , and its context ?",
    "first , evolving the solution subspaces , considered as curves in the grassmann manifold is not new for autonomous problems  see hermann and martin  @xcite , martin and hermann  @xcite brockett and byrnes  @xcite , shayman  @xcite , rosenthal  @xcite , ravi , rosenthal and wang  @xcite , zelikin  @xcite , abou ",
    "kandil , freiling , ionescu and jank  @xcite and bittanti , laub and willems  @xcite .",
    "using riccati systems to solve nonautonomous spectral problems is also not new  see johnson  @xcite , hutson  @xcite , pryce  @xcite , manopoulous and gray  @xcite , gray and manopoulous  @xcite and chou and wyatt  @xcite .",
    "here riccati systems correspond to the flow of the linear spectral problem projected onto the grassmann manifold with a fixed coordinate patch representation  see schneider  @xcite . also see schiff and shnider  @xcite and chou and wyatt  @xcite who use this connection to integrate riccati systems through singularities .",
    "that we have a numerical method that avoids representation singularities for nonautonomous systems is _",
    "new_. the idea is as follows . given data that lies in a suitable coordinate patch of the grassmann manifold , pullback to the stiefel manifold .",
    "evolve the solution one steplength along the stiefel manifold either directly using a runge  kutta method or a lie group method . then project onto a suitable and possibly different coordinate patch of the grassmann manifold using optimal gaussian elimination . in this last step",
    ", the practical method we propose picks a quasi - optimal coordinate patch in which to best represent the solution in the grassmann manifold ( see below and section  [ sec : nm ] ) .",
    "note that on first inspection the stiefel manifold is the direct natural setting for the stable and unstable solution subspaces .",
    "afterall in each case we have to construct the full set of solutions to a large system of differential equations satisfying the correct respective asymptotic boundary conditions in the far field .",
    "each solution set represents a curve in the stiefel manifold of dimension commensurate with the size of the solution set .",
    "that the spectral problems are linear means that all the relevant spectral information can be reconstructed from the flow in the corresponding grassmann manifold .",
    "that the matching condition is determinental , means that we only need the grassmann flow information  see martin and hermann  @xcite and brockett and byrnes  @xcite where this reduction was first considered for autonomous linear control problems ( in practice we will also need to retain a complex scalar field to ensure analytic dependence on parameters ) .",
    "this reduction is crucial because long - range integration along the stiefel manifold has been problematic ( due to multiple distinct exponential growth and decay rates ) and one of the simplest resolutions in the evans function context was to use plcker coordinates  whilst ignoring the plcker relations ( more on these below ) .",
    "second , retaining analyticity away from the essential spectrum is _ standard _ for any shooting method ; we prove analyticity in section  [ sec : sp ] .",
    "this allows for a global search for eigenvalues in that region by numerically computing the change in argument of the evans function round any closed contour . invoking the argument principle",
    ", this integer value represents the number of zeros of the evans function , and hence the number of eigenvalues counting multiplicity , inside the contour ; see brockett and byrnes  @xcite , alexander , gardner and jones  @xcite and ying and katz  @xcite .",
    "third , that our method allows matching anywhere in the longitudinal domain is _",
    "new_. we provide substantive numerical evidence .",
    "previously , other than in trivial cases , most numerical practioners used the common - sense rule of thumb of integrating the spectral problem from both ends of the longitudinal domain and matching at a point roughly centered on the front ( which is assumed to be localized ) . when solving the linear problem with plcker coordinates , it was first important to rescale for the far field spatial behaviour to neutralize its total exponential growth . integrating from the far field initial conditions ( a subset of the spatial eigenvectors ) , the solution remains roughly constant until the coefficient matrix starts to reveal its nonautonmous character due to the integration step impinging on the front",
    ". accuracy is retained whilst integrating through the front , but thereafter the problem becomes stiff .",
    "the issue is that the numerical methods can not resolve the simultaneous exponential growth and decay character associated with the other far - end stable and unstable subspaces .",
    "fourth , having polynomial complexity is _ essential _ and we provide here a _",
    "new _ alternate .",
    "after humpherys and zumbrun  @xcite introduced their continuous orthogonalization method in this context , which also has polynomial complexity , any new numerical spectral shooting method should have this property and also be competitive .",
    "previous successful methods used plcker coordinates , ignoring the quadratic plcker relations ( see section  [ sec : gs ] ) .",
    "they solved the flow for the corresponding linear vector field in the higher dimensional plcker embedding space .",
    "details of this plcker coordinate or compound matrix approach can be found in , for example , alexander and sachs  @xcite , brin  @xcite and allen and bridges  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the number of plcker coordinates typically grows exponentially with the order of the original system , and so this approach can not be used for medium to large order systems .",
    "however the continuous orthogonalization method of humpherys and zumbrun , and our method , are especially suited to large scale problems .",
    "fifth , our method for dynamic _",
    "practical optimal _ coordinate representation is _",
    "new_. given data on the stiefel manifold , for example generated by advancing the solution one steplength along the stiefel manifold , how can we project down onto the grassmann manifold using the best representation patch possible ?",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "the natural map projection from the stiefel to the grassmann manifolds is a linear fractional map ( milnor and stasheff  @xcite ; martin and hermann  @xcite ) .",
    "this map represents the action of equivalencing by transformations whose rank matches that of the stiefel manifold ( this takes us from the space of frames to the space of spaces spanning those frames ) .",
    "the stiefel manifold has a non - square matrix representation .",
    "projection onto the grassmann manifold corresponds to equivalencing by a full rank submatrix of the non - square stiefel matrix  this renders the corresponding submatrix as the identity matrix .",
    "we are free to choose which submatrix to equivalence by , each distinct choice corresponds to the matrix representation of a coordinate patch on the grassmann manifold .",
    "we can use gaussian elimination , via elementary column operations , to render any given full rank submatrix of the stiefel matrix as the identity matrix .",
    "the key is to try to pick the full rank submatrix which has the largest determinant  this corresponds to choosing the grassmannian patch that gives the best representation for the projection from the stiefel to grassmann manifold .",
    "ideally we would check the size of every full rank submatrix of the stiefel matrix and equivalence by the one with the largest determinant .",
    "however this is an np problem ( equivalent to using the plcker coordinates described above ) .",
    "we provide a practical solution of polynomial complexity .",
    "the method maximises the pivot used at each step of the gaussian elimination process . in the current context",
    ", we call it quasi - optimal gaussian elimination",
    ".    our paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : gs ] , we provide a tailored review of grassmann manifolds and their representation .",
    "we then show , in section  [ sec : vf ] how flows generated by linear vector fields on the stiefel manifold , produce a natural flow on the underlying grassmann manifold that is decoupled from the flow through the remaining fibres .",
    "we subsequently show how this leads to using riccati systems to resolve spectra , but that singularities that develop in the riccati flows present spectral matching problems . in section  [ sec : pgi ]",
    "we introduce two new practical approaches to avoiding these representation singularities .",
    "one is the idea behind our main method , the grassmann gaussian elimination method .",
    "the other is a modification of the riccati approach that changes the coordinate patch when deemed necessary .",
    "also in this section we show the connection between the riccati and continuous orthogonalization approaches .",
    "we present our proposed grassmann gaussian elimination method fully in section  [ sec : nm ] , including details of how in practice to choose the quasi - optimal grassmannian coordinate representation patch .",
    "we review the evans function in section  [ sec : sp ] and discuss further simple practical numerical refinements that retain analyticity and prevent potential numerical overflow .",
    "we then implement and compare all the competing numerical methods in section  [ sec : es ] in three distinct applications . finally in section  [ sec : conclu ] we conclude and present future directions .",

    "can be represented by an @xmath12 matrix of rank @xmath0 , say @xmath13 .",

    "any element of @xmath23 has a unique matrix representation @xmath27 whose @xmath26th @xmath25 submatrix is the identity matrix .",
    "for example , if @xmath28 then any element of @xmath29 can be uniquely represented by a matrix of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "conversely , a @xmath12 matrix of this form represents a @xmath0-plane in @xmath23 .",
    "each coordinate patch @xmath23 is an open , dense subset of @xmath8 and the union of all such patches covers @xmath8 . for each @xmath26",
    ", there is a bijective map @xmath34 given by @xmath35 each @xmath36 is thus a local coordinate chart for the coordinate patch @xmath23 of @xmath8 .",
    "for all @xmath37 , if @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the @xmath40th @xmath25 submatrix of @xmath27 , then @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath39 represents the transformation between representative patchs and depends holomorphically on @xmath27 , we deduce @xmath42 is holomorphic . note that @xmath8 has a structure of a complex manifold ( see griffiths and harris  @xcite ) .",
    "further the unitary group @xmath43 acts continuously and surjectively on @xmath8 .",
    "hence @xmath8 is compact and connected .",
    "lastly , the general linear group @xmath44 acts transitively on @xmath8 and it is a homogeneous manifold isomorphic to @xmath45 ( see chern  @xcite or warner  @xcite ) .",

    "if we change the basis , the basis for the image changes by the determinant of the transformation matrix .",
    "hence the map is a point in @xmath51 .",
    "we can recover @xmath14 from its image @xmath48 as the set of all vectors @xmath52 such that @xmath53 .",

    "it can also be realized as follows .",
    "a natural coordinatization of @xmath51 is through the determinants of all the @xmath25 submatrices of @xmath14 , normalized by a chosen minor characterized by an index @xmath26 , hence @xmath56 .",
    "these minor determinants  the plcker coordinates  are not all independent , indeed , they satisfy quadratic relations known as the _ plcker relations _ ( which may themselves not all be independent ) .",
    "the image of the plcker map @xmath54 is thus the subspace of @xmath57 cut out by the quadratic plcker relations .",
    "recall that we can consider the stiefel manifold as a principle fibre bundle @xmath58 .",
    "our goal here is to characterize the induced decomposition of the tangent space @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "we can decompose the tangent space @xmath59 into horizontal and vertical subspaces ( see , for example , montgomery  @xcite ) @xmath61 the horizontal subspace @xmath62 is associated with the tangent space of the grassmannian base space , while the vertical subspace @xmath63 is associated with the fibres homeomorphic to @xmath10 .",
    "let us choose the coordinate patch representation @xmath23 for @xmath8 for some @xmath18 .",

    "hence we compare the remaining five methods in figure  [ bouss : matchright ] in this case .",
    "we see that using the mbius  magnus method to integrate through a singularity does not introduce loss in accuracy .",
    "the resulting evans function can have poles , as seen in figure [ fig3bb ] , which appear at @xmath257-values where the riccati equation has a singularity at the matching point .",
    "this means that in some cases the matching point should be chosen rather carefully in order not to have the poles interfering with the eigenvalue(s ) .",

    "however it is clear from the right plot in figure  [ figrge ] , that multiple successive steps can be integrated in the same coordinate patch .",
    "for example , between @xmath371 and @xmath372 the coordinate patch does not change . performing the whole quasi - optimal gaussian elimination process only when a certain criterion is satisfied , reduces the computing time . using the riccati - qoge method",

    "this generates an evans function very similar to that in figure  [ figrge ] . as seen in figure  [ figrge2 ] the quasi - optimal gaussian elimination process",

    "we now outline several directions in which we plan to use and extend these methods .",

    "see deng and nii  @xcite , gesztesy , latushkin and makarov  @xcite and gesztesy , latushkin and zumbrun  @xcite . from a numerical perspective",
    "we have , together with niesen , implemented some of the methods we propose in this paper in a multi - dimensional context .",
    "in particular , it is well known in autocatalysis and combustion that planar travelling fronts can be unstable to transverse perturbations and develop into steadily propagating travelling fronts with wrinkles . in ledoux , malham , niesen and thmmler  @xcite",
    "we show that the wrinkled fronts themselves develop an instability as a diffusion parameter is further increased .    for large scale problems the lie group methods we propose using the magnus expansion may become prohibitive .",
    "this is because of the effort required to compute the matrix exponential  see moler and van loan  @xcite , celledoni and iserles  @xcite , munthe - kaas and zanna  @xcite and iserles and zanna  @xcite . for the examples we considered this",
    "was not an issue .",
    "however it remains to be seen if such lie group methods will be cost effective for larger problems  the methods we proposed based on runge  kutta integration such as ggem - rk can be used as they scale favourably with system size .",
    "the constructs and grassmannian reductions we have considered in this paper , it turns out , have their origins in the control theory literature dating back to the early seventies , in particular in the pioneering papers of hermann and martin  @xcite , martin and hermann  @xcite and brockett and byrnes  @xcite .",

    "riccati methods in particular also have their origins in the quantum chemistry literature also dating back to the early seventies  a recent survey of these numerical methods can be found in chou and wyatt  @xcite .",
    "however also see light and walker  @xcite , johnson  @xcite , hutson  @xcite and gray and manopoulous  @xcite .",
    "in particular the log - derivative and @xmath453-propagation methods correspond to special choices of grassmannian patch in the riccati methods we mention above .",
    "prfer methods , for which we can think of the patch evolving , originate even further back ; see prfer  @xcite and pryce  @xcite .",
    "of course , our quasi - optimal gaussian elimination process for choosing a suitable representative patch was inspired by the schubert cell decomposition of the grassmann manifold ; see for example billey  @xcite , griffiths and harris  @xcite , kleiman and laksov  @xcite , kresch  @xcite , postnikov  @xcite , sottile  @xcite and , in a somewhat different vein , kodama  @xcite . since the grassmann manifold is the disjoint union of schubert cells , the question is , can we express the flow on the grassmann manifold as a flow on schubert cells ( see griffiths and harris and also ravi , rosenthal and wang  @xcite ) ? can we construct the corresponding flow on the cohomological ring of schubert cycles ( chern  @xcite ; fulton  @xcite ) ?",

    "<S> we present a new numerical method for computing the pure - point spectrum associated with the linear stability of coherent structures . in the context of the evans function shooting and matching approach , </S>",
    "<S> all the relevant information is carried by the flow projected onto the underlying grassmann manifold . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to numerically construct this projected flow in a stable and robust manner . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the method avoids representation singularities by , in practice , choosing the best coordinate patch representation for the flow as it evolves . </S>",
    "<S> the method is analytic in the spectral parameter and of complexity bounded by the order of the spectral problem cubed . for large systems it represents a competitive method to those recently developed that are based on continuous orthogonalization . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this by comparing the two methods in three applications : boussinesq solitary waves , autocatalytic travelling waves and ekman boundary layer . </S>"
