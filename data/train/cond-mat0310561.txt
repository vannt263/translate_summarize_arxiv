    "the dynamics of excitons in chain - like systems , like conjugated polymers,@xcite polysilanes,@xcite and molecular j - aggregates,@xcite have attracted much attention over the past decades .",
    "the dynamics in these systems result from the complicated interplay between various processes , in particular from relaxation to the ground state ( population relaxation ) , from migration of the exciton to sites with different excitation energy ( population redistribution ) , and from relaxation caused by nuclear displacements ( exciton self - trapping ) .",
    "population relaxation is distinguished in radiative and nonradiatiave channels . with regards to migration ,",
    "two limiting situations are usually considered .",
    "the first one is the case of incoherent energy transfer ( frster transfer ) , which takes place between strongly localized excitations on the chain .",
    "this is also referred to as hopping transfer in a disordered site energy distribution . in the other limit , one deals with weakly localized exciton states , which may extend over many repeat units of the chain .",
    "transitions between such band - like exciton states are possible due to their scattering on lattice vibrations and are often referred to as intraband relaxation .",
    "the net effect of the above processes may be probed by various optical techniques , of which steady - state and time - resolved fluorescence spectroscopy are the most frequently used ones .",
    "common quantities extracted from such experiments are the decay time of the total fluorescence intensity following pulsed excitation and the steady - state as well as the dynamic stokes shift .",
    "as most of the dynamic processes mentioned above are influenced by temperature in a different way , one often also probes the temperature dependence of the fluorescence .",
    "the temperature dependence of the fluorescence decay time has drawn particular attention in the case of molecular j - aggregates of polymethine dyes . in these systems ,",
    "the frenkel exciton states are delocalized over tens of molecules ( weakly localized excitons ) .",
    "the coherent nature of the excitation extended over many molecules leads to states with giant oscillator strengths , which scale like the number of molecules over which the exciton state is delocalized .",
    "these so - called superradiant states lie near the bottom of the bare exciton band , and , especially at low temperatures , lead to ultrafast spontaneous emission ( 10 s to 100 s of ps ) .   upon increasing the temperature",
    ", these systems typically exhibit an increase of the fluorescence lifetime , which is a trend that is highly unusual for single - molecule excitations and is intimately related to the extended nature of the exciton states .",
    "this unusual temperature dependence was first observed for the j - aggregates of pseudoisocyanine ( pic ) ,   and later has been confirmed for other types of j - aggregates , in particular , 5,5,6,6-tetrachloro-1,1-diethyl-3,3-di ( 4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine ( tdbc ) ,  @xcite 1,1-diethyl-3,3-bis(sulfopropyl)-5,5,6,6-tetrachlorobenzimidacarbocyanine ( bic ) ,  @xcite and 3,3-bis(sulfopropyl)-5,5-dichloro-9-ethylthiacarbocyanine ( thiats ) .",
    "@xcite the slowing down of the aggregate radiative dynamics is usually attributed to the thermal population of the higher - energy exciton states , which in j - aggregates have oscillator strengths small compared to those of the superradiant exciton states .",
    "@xcite in spite of the basic understanding that the redistribution of the initial exciton population over the band states plays a crucial role in this problem , the theoretical efforts to describe this redistribution and to fit all details of this behavior have not been fully successful so far  @xcite ( see the discussions presented in ref .  ) . in particular , as we have found from our previous study on homogeneous model aggregates ,  @xcite the initial excitation conditions seem to play a crucial role in the interpretation of the measured fluorescence lifetime : under certain conditions this lifetime probes the intraband relaxation time scale , rather than the superradiant emission time .    the stokes shift of the fluorescence spectrum in linear exciton systems has been considered previously by various authors ; studies of its temperature dependence are rare .",
    "one of the first studies concerned the stokes shift in polysilanes at liquid - helium temperatures , which was modelled in a phenomenological way by assuming that intraband relaxation is determined by one energy - independent relaxation rate in combination with the number of available lower - energy exciton states in a disordered chain.@xcite relaxation by migration to the lowest - exciton state available on a linear chain also forms the main ingredient of the theoretical study of chernyak et al.@xcite on the relation between the fluorescence lineshape and the superradiant emission rate deep in the red wing of the density of states of disordered j - aggregates at cryogenic temperatures . for @xmath0-conjugated polymers",
    "the time - dependent shift of the luminescence spectrum ( dynamic stokes shift ) has been modeled by assuming excitons localized on a few repeat units , which migrate spatially as well as energetically through frster transfer.@xcite it was concluded that the stokes shift in these systems can not be explained from nuclear displacements , as would be the case for single molecules , and that the migration process plays a crucial role.@xcite also for j - aggregates , with strongly delocalized exciton states , the believe is that the stokes shift induced by nuclear displacements is small , in fact much smaller than the stokes shift of their single - molecule constituents .",
    "the explanation lies in the fact that for a delocalized excitation the weight of the excitation on each molecule of the chain is small , which leads to a small nuclear displacement on each molecule .",
    "the measured stokes shift differs for various types of j - aggregates , for instance for pic a shift can hardly be detected,@xcite while for tdbc,@xcite bic,@xcite and thiats @xcite a clear shift can be observed . as far as we are aware , the temperature dependence of the stokes shift was only measured for thiats aggregates.@xcite it shows an interesting non - monotonic behavior , analogous to the one found in disordered narrow quantum wells,@xcite where it finds its origin in thermally activated escape from local minima in the random potential .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to model the temperature dependence of the dynamics of weakly localized excitons in linear chains and to establish the effect on the fluorescence lifetime and stokes shift",
    ". we will be mostly interested in temperatures up to about 100 k , where scattering on acoustic phonons is the dominant scattering mechanism .",
    "the current paper is an extension of our previous work , where we studied the temperature dependence of the fluorescence lifetime and restricted ourselves to ideal ( homogeneous ) frenkel chains .",
    "@xcite here , we consider a more detailed model , which includes on - site ( diagonal ) disorder .",
    "it is well - known that this model provides a good basis for understanding the complex ( linear and nonlinear ) optical dynamics in j - aggregates .",
    "we will take into account the following factors that seem to be essential under common experimental conditions : ( i ) _ localization _ of the exciton states by the site disorder , ( ii ) coupling of the localized excitons to the _ host vibrations _",
    "( not only to the vibrations of the aggregate itself as was done in refs .   and  ) , ( iii ) a possible _ non - equilibrium _ of the subsystem of localized frenkel excitons on the time scale of the emission process , and ( iv ) the nature of the excitation conditions ( resonant versus non - resonant ) .",
    "we use a pauli master equation to describe the evolution of the populations of the localized exciton states and the intraband redistribution of population after the initial excitation .",
    "previously , such a master equation was also used to model the exciton dynamics in disordered quantum wells@xcite and polysilane films.@xcite as observables , we focus on the stokes shift of the fluorescence spectrum and the decay times of the total as well as the energy dependent fluorescence intensity .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present the model hamiltonian of frenkel excitons with diagonal disorder , the main effect of which is localization of the exciton states on finite segments of the aggregate .",
    "we briefly reiterate the basic facts concerning the structure of the exciton eigenenergies and eigenfunctions close to the band bottom , which is the spectral range that mainly determines the exciton optical response and dynamics .",
    "the pauli master equation that describes the transfer of populations between the various exciton eigenstates , is introduced in sec .",
    "the numerical solution of this equation under various conditions is obtained and used in sec .",
    "[ sssd ] to study the steady - state fluorescence spectra and the temperature dependence of the stokes shift and in sec .",
    "[ lt ] to study the temperature dependent fluorescence lifetime .",
    "the results are also discussed in terms of back - of - the envelope estimates based on the low - energy exciton structure . finally , we summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "we consider a generic one - dimensional frenkel exciton model , consisting of a regular chain of @xmath1 optically active sites , which are modeled as two - level systems with parallel transition dipoles .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the state in which the @xmath4th site is excited and all the other sites are in the ground state .",
    "the excitation energy of site @xmath4 is denoted @xmath5 .",
    "we will account for energetic disorder by assuming that each @xmath5 is taken randomly , and uncorrelated from the other site energies , from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath6 and standard deviation @xmath7 .",
    "hereafter , @xmath8 is set to zero .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath9 are considered to be nonrandom , and are assumed to be of dipolar origin : @xmath10 @xmath11 . here",
    ", the parameter @xmath12 represents the nearest - neighbor coupling , which is positive for the systems of our interest , namely those that have the optically dominant states at the bottom of the exciton band .",
    "molecular j - aggregates are prototype examples of such systems . diagonalizing the @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 yields the exciton eigenenergies and wavefunctions .",
    "in particular , the @xmath15th eigenvalue @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 ) is the energy of the exciton state @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the @xmath4th component of the @xmath15th eigenvector .    as has been shown in ref .",
    ", in the absence of disorder ( @xmath20 , the case of a homogeneous chain ) the eigenvectors in the presence of long - range dipolar interactions with an accuracy of the order of @xmath21 agree with those for the case of nearest - neighbor hopping : @xmath22 where we introduced the wavenumber @xmath23 and @xmath24 is used as quantum label for this homogeneous case .",
    "these states are extended ( delocalized ) over the entire chain .",
    "it turns out that the state @xmath25 is the lowest ( bottom ) state of the exciton band .",
    "close the bottom ( @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 ) and in the limit of large @xmath1 , the exciton dispersion relation reads  @xcite @xmath28 furthermore , assuming that the chain is short compared to an optical wavelength , the oscillator strengths of the states @xmath29 close to the bottom of the band are given by @xmath30 here , the oscillator strength of a single molecule is set to unity .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) , the lowest state @xmath25 ( with the energy @xmath31 ) accumulates almost the entire oscillator strength , @xmath32 .",
    "its radiative rate is thus given by is @xmath33 , i.e. , roughly @xmath1 times larger than the radiative rate @xmath34 of a monomer.@xcite the @xmath25 state is therefore referred to as the superradiant state .",
    "the oscillator strengths of the other odd states @xmath35 are much smaller ,  @xmath36 , while the even states ( @xmath37 ) carry no oscillator strength at all , @xmath38 . as a consequence ,",
    "the exciton absorption band occurs at the bottom of the exciton band , red - shifted with respect to the monomer absorption band .",

    "( b ) oscillator strength per state @xmath39 , and ( c ) absorption spectrum @xmath40 calculated for different disorder strengths : @xmath41 ( solid ) , @xmath42 ( dashed ) , and @xmath43 ( dotted ) .",
    "the disorder results in a tail of states below the bare exciton band edge @xmath44 , which is more pronounced for larger degree of disorder .",
    "each spectrum for the oscillator strength per state has a well defined maximum and shows that the states in the tail carry most of the oscillator strength .",
    "this spectrum also tends to widen upon increasing @xmath45 .",
    "the absorption spectra simply reflect the fact that @xmath46.,width=188 ]    in the presence of disorder ( @xmath47 ) , the exciton wave functions become localized on segments that are smaller than the chain length @xmath1 .",
    "one of the important consequences of this localization is the appearance of states below the bare exciton band bottom @xmath48 ; these states form a tail of the density of states and in fact carry most of the oscillator strength . as a consequence ,",
    "the linear absorption spectrum of the exciton system is spectrally located at this tail .",
    "all these properties are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the density of states , @xmath49 , the absorption spectrum , @xmath40 , and the oscillator strength per state , @xmath50 , are depicted for three values of the disorder strength : @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "these quantities have been calculated in the standard way using numerical simulations and the definitions :    [ 2 ] @xmath53 @xmath54    0.5 cm where the angular brackets denote the average over the disorder realizations .",
    "the statistics was improved using the smoothening technique developed in ref .  .",
    "despite the fact that the tail of the density of states does not show any spectral structure , it has been shown that the exciton wave functions and energy levels in this spectral region do exhibit a specific ( local ) structure .",
    "@xcite this structure is revealed by plotting the wave functions obtained for a particular realization of the disorder ( see fig .",
    "[ figwave ] for the case of @xmath55 ) .",
    "the tail states ( filled in black ) have an appreciable amplitude only on localized segments of a typical size @xmath56 ( localization length ; in the current example @xmath57 ) . some of them have no nodes within the localization segments ( states 1 - 6 and 8 in fig .  [ figwave ] , with the states counted starting from the lowest one ) .",
    "such states can be interpreted as local excitonic ground states .",
    "they carry large oscillator strengths , approximately @xmath56 times larger than that of a monomer , and thus mainly contribute to the excitonic absorption and emission .",
    "the typical spontaneous emission rate of these states is @xmath58 .     and energy levels @xmath16 in the vicinity of the bottom of the exciton band for a particular realization of the disorder at @xmath41 .",

    "the baseline of each state represents its energy in units of @xmath12 .",
    "the wave function amplitudes are in arbitrary units .",
    "it is seen that the lower states ( filled in black ) are localized on segments of the chain with a typical size small compared to the chain length .",
    "some of these localized states can be grouped into local manifolds of two or sometimes three states that overlap well with each other and overlap much weaker with the states of other manifolds [ see the doublets of states ( 2,9 ) and ( 6,10 ) , and the triplet ( 1,7,11 ) ( states counted starting from the lowest one ) ] .",
    "the higher states ( filled in gray ) are more extended and cover several segments at which the lower states are localized.,width=226 ]    some of the local ground states have partners localized on the same segment ; examples are the doublets of states ( 2,9 ) and ( 6,10 ) in fig .",
    "[ figwave ] .",
    "these partner states have a well defined node within the localization segment and can be assigned to the first ( local ) excited state of the segment .",
    "their oscillator strengths are typically several times smaller than those of the local ground states . sometimes , but less frequently , a local manifold contains three states , such as the triplet ( 1,7,11 ) , with the third state being similar to the second excited state of the segment and having an oscillator strength small compared to that of the local ground state as well . the rest of the local ground states ( see the states 3 , 4 , 5 and 8) do not have well defined partners , because the latter ( higher in energy ) are extended over a few ( adjacent ) @xmath56-site segments ( the states 12 , 13 , 14 and 15 )",
    ". the oscillator strengths of these high - energy state are also small compared to those of the local ground states .",
    "such states form mixed manifolds .",
    "the mean energy spacing between the levels of a segment represents the natural energy scale in the tail of the density of states .",
    "the local spectral structure corresponding to this spacing , however , turns out to be hidden in the total density of states , because the mean absolute energy difference between the local ground states of different segments is approximately 1.5 times as large as the energy spacing between states within a single segment .",
    "@xcite in spite of the fact that this local structure is not visible in the density of states and the absorption spectrum , it is clear that it plays a crucial role in the low - temperature dynamics of the excitons , because the dynamics is governed by the local structure of wave functions and spectral distribution .    as is observed in fig .  [ figwave ] , above the states that extend over a few adjacent segments , states occur that are extended over many segments ; they hardly carry any oscillator strength at all . in spite of this",
    ", these states play an important role in the problem of the temperature dependence of the exciton fluorescence decay time .",
    "increasing the temperature , leads to their thermal population , which in turn leads to slowing down the fluorescence decay .    ,",

    ", the oscillator strengths have been rescaled by the average value @xmath63 of @xmath64 in the interval and for the disorder strength under consideration .",
    "it is clearly seen that the width of each of the distributions is of the order of its mean . ]    to end this section , we stress that the segment size @xmath56 has the meaning of a _ typical _ number and in practice undergoes large fluctuations.@xcite first , the actual localization length of exciton states , as may for instance be assessed from the participation ratio , is energy dependent ; it becomes smaller towards lower energy and even over the narrow region of the absorption band , this difference may be sizable.@xcite second , even when we focus on a narrow region within the absorption band , the stochastic nature of the disordered system gives rise to large fluctuations in the localization size of the exciton wave functions .",
    "for the optical dynamics , it is important that these fluctuations are also reflected in fluctuations of the oscillator strength of the exciton states . to illustrate this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ figdistr](a ) the simulated distribution of the oscillator strength per state in an energy interval of width @xmath65 centered at the energy where the average oscillator strength per state has its maximum ( cf .",

    "we make the following observations : ( i ) the distributions have a width that is comparable to their mean , confirming the large fluctuations in segment size and extent and shape of the wave functions .",
    "( ii ) in both narrow energy intervals , states are found with hardly any oscillator strength , which indicates that at both energies states occur with nodes . from the distributions",
    "it appears that such states with nodes are more abundant at the center of the absorption band ( i.e. , towards higher energy ) , which is consistent with the above explained local structure .",
    "we have confirmed this by doing a statistical analysis of the node structure of the wave function , using the value of @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "the criterion for the node structure developed in ref .  ) .",
    "( iii ) interestingly , the distributions plotted on the scale of @xmath67 appear to be invariant under changing the disorder strength .",
    "this is consistent with an invariance of the local structure of the exciton energies and wave functions near the lower band edge .",
    "to describe the dynamics of the exciton eigenstates @xmath70 of the hamiltonian with site disorder , we will account for the effect of spontaneous emission and the scattering of excitons on lattice vibations .",
    "we will describe this combined dynamics on the level of a pauli master equation for the populations @xmath71 of the exciton states : @xmath72 where the dot denotes the time derivative , @xmath73 is the spontaneous emission rate of the exciton state @xmath70 ( with @xmath74 the dimensionless oscillator strength ) , and @xmath75 is the transition rate from the localized exciton state @xmath76 to the state @xmath70 . this transition rate is crucial in the description of the redistribution of the exciton population over the localized exciton states . the model for @xmath75",
    "is based on certain assumptions about the coupling between the excitons and the lattice vibrations . in refs .   and",
    ", only the coupling between the excitons and the vibrations of the linear chain itself was taken into account . in reality , however , the exciton chains that we are interested in , such as linear aggregates , are not isolated , but are embedded in a host medium , so that the excitons are coupled to the host vibrations as well .",
    "the density of states of the latter is large compared to that of the vibrations of the chain itself .",
    "for this reason , it is natural to assume that it is the coupling of the excitons to the host vibrations that determines the exciton intraband relaxation in the linear chain .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the glassy model for @xmath75 which we have introduced in our previous publication dealing with homogeneous molecular aggreates .",
    "@xcite this model assumes a weak linear on - site coupling of the excitons to acoustic phonons of the host medium and ignores correlations in the displacements of the different sites on the chain . within this model ,",
    "the transition rates are given by ( see for details ref .  )",
    "@xmath77 here , the constant @xmath78 is a parameter that characterizes the overall strength of the phonon - assisted exciton scattering rates .",
    "its microscopic definition involves the nearest - neighbor excitation transfer interaction @xmath12 , the velocity of sound in the host medium , and the mass of the sites in the exciton chain.@xcite in this paper , we will consider @xmath78 as one composite parameter , which may be varied to account for different host and ( or ) exciton systems",
    ". the spectral factor @xmath79 describes that part of the @xmath80-dependence of @xmath75 which derives from the exciton - phonon coupling and the density of phonon states .",

    "due to the presence of the factors @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the transition rates meet the principle of detailed balance : @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "thus , in the absence of radiative decay ( @xmath86 ) , the eventual ( equilibrium ) exciton distribution is the boltzmann distribution .    within the debye model for the density of phonon states",
    ", the spectral factor is given by@xcite @xmath87 .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the applicability of this model to glassy host media is restricted to a very narrow frequency interval of the order of several wave numbers ( see , for instance , refs .   and  ) .",
    "therefore , we rather consider a simple linear approximation for this factor , latexmath:[$s(e_\\nu - e_{\\mu } ) =    and .",
    "this scaling properly accounts for a decrease of the exciton - phonon interaction in the long - wave acoustic limit  @xcite and prevents the divergence of @xmath75 at small values of @xmath89 .",
    "we checked that the results reported in this paper are not essentially affected by assuming a higher power in the dependence of @xmath75 on the energy mismatch .",
    "in disordered systems , the overlap integral @xmath90 appearing in the expression for @xmath75 plays a much stronger role in the optical dynamics than the details of the dependence of @xmath91 on the energy mismatch .",
    "the fact that @xmath75 is proportional to this overlap integral allows one to distinguish between two types of exciton transitions occurring in the vicinity of the bottom of the exciton band ( the region of main interest at low temperatures ) , namely intrasegment and intersegment transitions .",
    "these two types of transitions involve , respectively , states localized on the same localization segment of the chain and states localized on different segments .",
    "as has been established in ref .",
    ", for both processes the overlap integrals scale inversely proportional to the typical segment size @xmath56 , while numerically the intrasegment overlap integral is approximately 50 times as large as the intersegment one ( independent of the disorder strength @xmath7 ) . furthermore , the overlap integrals between the local states of a segment and one of the higher states that is extended over the same segment as well as the adjacent ones ( such as the states 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 in fig .",
    "[ figwave ] ) , are of the same order as the intrasegment overlap integral .",
    "this implies a specific scenario for the exciton intraband relaxation at low temperatures .",
    "let us assume that the exciton , initially created in the blue tail of the absorption band ( a condition which is usually met in experiments ) , quickly relaxes to one of the exciton states of a local manifold .",
    "denote the two local states involved by the quantum labels 1 ( ground state ) and 2 ( excited state ) . because of the difference in intra- and intersegment overlap integrals discussed above , the exciton first relaxes within the local manifold , provided that the intrasegment transition rate is larger than the radiative rates @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . only after this first step of relaxation",
    ", the exciton can hop to the states of other ( adjacent ) local manifolds , again , provided the intersegment hopping rate is larger than @xmath92 .",
    "note that if @xmath92 is larger than any transition rate @xmath75 , the exciton emits a photon before any relaxation step ( intra- or intersegment ) occurs . on this basis",
    ", one may distinguish between a fast and a slow limit of intrasegment relaxation . to this end",
    ", we compare the typical value of the intrasegment transition rate @xmath94 at zero temperature , with the radiative rate @xmath95 of the local ground state . if @xmath96 , we are in the fast - relaxation limit .",
    "this inequality guarantees that at zero temperature , the exciton fluorescence decay is governed by the radiative process with a rate of the order of @xmath95 .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath97 , the intrasegment relaxation rate @xmath94 dictates the exciton fluorescence decay .",
    "this is very similar to the distinction of fast and slow relaxation which we have previously made in the case of fully delocalized excitons in homogeneous molecular aggregates.@xcite the reader may find an elaborate discussion on the principle difference between these two limits in ref .  .    for the remainder of this paper",
    ", it is useful to find the value of @xmath78 that distinguishes between the limits of fast and slow intrasegment relaxation ; we will denote this value by @xmath98 .",
    "we first estimate @xmath94 by replacing @xmath99 by @xmath100 , giving @xmath101",
    ". then we equate @xmath94 to the superradiant decay rate @xmath95 , which is typically @xmath102 , and obtain @xmath103 if we restrict for a moment to nearest - neighbor interactions , we may even go one step further by realizing that , as a consequence of wave vector quantization and level repulsion within localization segments , the typical energy difference @xmath104 then scales like @xmath105,@xcite which leads to @xmath106 from this expression , it is clear that @xmath98 steeply decreases with decreasing segment size , i.e. , with increasing degree of disorder .",
    "this steep scaling is not essentially affected by taking into account long - range dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "thus , if the degree of disorder increases and the excitons become more localized , there is a strong tendency of the system to move into the fast - relaxation limit , where the radiative decay governs the fluorescence kinetics .",
    "following intraband relaxation , the next relaxation step involves transitions between states of different segments ( exciton migration ) .",
    "similarly to the above , one may distinguish the limits of fast and slow intersegment relaxation , defined as @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . here",
    ", the states @xmath109 and @xmath110 denote the ground states localized on adjacent segments and it is assumed that @xmath111 . if the transfer process is slow , the exciton spontaneously decays before it makes a hop to an adjacent localization segment with @xmath112 . as a result",
    ", the fluorescence spectrum is expected to coincide with the absorption band , because the latter is mainly determined by the total collection of local ground states ( the segment states with appreciable oscillator strength ) , i.e. , in the absorption spectrum each local ground state contributes , independent of the value of its energy . however ,",
    "if the intersegment transfer process is fast , the exciton can make down - hill hops before the fluorescence is emitted .",
    "therefore , lower - energy local ground states will give a larger contribution to the fluorescence spectrum than higher - energy ones ; this gives rise to a visible red shift ( stokes shift ) of the fluorescence spectrum with respect to the absorption band ( see sec .",

    "[ figsssp](a ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this large value for @xmath78 lies outside the range of validity of our theory .",

    "the typical energy difference between the local ground states is of the order of the absorption band width .",

    "the number of states with still lower energy then strongly reduces , giving rise to an increased expectation value for the distance to such lower energy states .",
    "in fact , already after one jump the exciton has a strongly suppressed chance to jump further during its lifetime ; it will generally emit a photon without further jumps ( migration ) .",
    "thus , the states deep in the tail of the dos can typically not be reached by the excitons , simply because they occur at a low density .",
    "this qualitatively explains the fact why the stokes shift of the fluorescence spectrum does not exceed the absorption band width , even for @xmath78 large compared to @xmath113 ( see fig .",
    "[ figsssp ] ) . upon a small increase of the temperature from zero , however , it becomes easier to reach those lower - lying states , because the spatial migration to other segments may take place by thermally - activated transitions involving exciton states that are extended over several localization segments as intermediate states .",
    "@xcite it is this indirect hopping that is responsible for the increase of the stokes shift at temperatures small compared to the absorption band width .",

    "this simply results from the fact that the absorption band widths for these two values of the disorder strength are ( in temperature units ) 40 k and 300 k , respectively .",
    "we recall that the rate of up - hill transfer @xmath188 $ ] , @xmath189 being of the order of the absorption bandwidth .",

    "[ figsssp](b ) : detection at the position of the red half maximum of this spectum ( solid line ) , at the peak of this spectrum ( dashed line ) , and at the blue half maximum ( dotted line ) .",
    "the average was performed over 10000 realizations of the disorder.,width=226 ]    we see that at zero temperature the decay times clearly differ for the three detection energies . for the case of red detection , we observe a decay time of 152 ps . based on the average oscillator strength per state at this red - wing energy , we arrive at a purely radiative decay time ( @xmath217 ) of 145 ps .",
    "the agreement between these numbers indicates that at the red side the decay time at zero temperature is determined completely by radiative decay ; intraband relaxation has no effect at this energy .",
    "the reason is that this detection energy lies very deep in the tail of the dos , where the occurrence of neighboring segments with lower energy is negligible . for the detection at the peak position",
    ", we find a zero temperature decay time of 100 ps , which is about 16% faster than the purely radiative time scale of 120 ps at this energy .",
    "the difference is due to relaxation to lower lying exciton states in neighboring segments .",
    "naturally , this effect is even stronger at the blue position , where the observed decay time of 44 ps is considerably faster than the purely radiative decay time of 168 ps . at this blue position ,",
    "also an increased influence from intrasegment relaxation exists , as at these higher energies a fraction of the states already represent an excited segment state , with one node ( cf .",
    "[ figdistr ] ) .",
    "we also observe from fig .",
    "[ figtaue ] that at high temperature the decay times for the different detection energies approach each other and in fact they then all tend to the decay time of the total fluorescence intensity ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ figtauoff](b ) ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the scattering rates are then large enough for the exciton populations to become equilibrated on the time scale of emission .",
    "a comparable observation was made in ref .",
    "for the decay of the populations of the various exciton states for homogeneous aggregates .",
    "we finally observe that the temperature dependence is non - monotonic in the same temperature range for which the stokes shift behaves non - monotonically ( cf .",
    "[ figstokes ] ) .",
    "indeed , we attribute this behavior to the same temperature activated intersegment relaxation via higher lying exciton states . at the blue detection side ( which still lies in the red tail of the dos )",
    ", this effect leads to a decrease of the lifetime , as it opens extra decay channels . on the red side ,",
    "the situation is more subtle .",
    "this energy is so deep in the red tail of the dos , that even the activated migration hardly opens new channels for decay . instead",
    ", the activated relaxation occurring at the blue side towards lower energies will be lead to extra contributions in the fluorescence intensity at the red side and , thus , to a growth of the decay time at this energy . at the peak position , we deal with the intermediate situation and we see a very small net effect .",
    "we notice that the general characteristics displayed in fig .",
    "[ figtaue ] very well cover the experimental results reported by scheblykin et al.@xcite",
    "we have performed a numerical study of the temperature dependence of the exciton dynamics in linear frenkel exciton systems with uncorrelated diagonal disorder . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the resulting temperature dependent steady - state fluorescence spectrum , its stokes shift relative to the absorption spectrum , and the decay time of the total fluorescence intensity following pulsed excitation .",
    "the complicated exciton dynamics reflected in these observables is governed by the interplay between thermal redistribution of the excitons over a set of eigenstates , which are localized by the disorder , and their radiative emission .",
    "the redistribution of exciton population within the manifolds of localized exciton states was described by a pauli master equation .",
    "the transition between two localized states was assumed to originate from the coupling of the excitons to acoustic phonons of the host medium , the transition rates being proportional to the overlap integral of the corresponding wave functions squared .",
    "the model is characterized by two free parameters , @xmath7 , which denotes the degree of disorder , and @xmath218 , the phonon - assisted exciton scattering rate , which sets the overall scale for transition rates between exciton states .",
    "the fact that our model only accounts for scattering on acoustic phonons , in principle limits us to temperatures of the order of 100 k and less .",
    "this covers the temperature range of many experiments performed on linear dye aggregates .",
    "besides , as is clear from our simulations , if the exciton scattering rate is large enough , equilibration within the exciton space ( on the time scale for radiative dynamics ) already occurs at temperatures below 100 k. above the equilibration temperature , the precise nature of the scattering mechanism becomes unimportant . in practice , the fact that in our pauli master equation for the exciton populations , homogeneous broadening ( dephasing ) can not be considered , probably yields a stronger limitation to the accuracy at elevated temperatures than the restriction to acoustic phonons . incorporating dephasing , i.e. , accounting for the possible breakdown of coherence within delocalization segments , requires considering the exciton density operator ( also see end of sec .  [ fs ] ) .",
    "> from our simulations we found that the stokes shift of the fluorescence spectrum shows an anomalous ( non - monotonic ) temperature dependence : it first increases upon increasing the temperature from zero , before , at a certain temperature , it starts to show the usual monotonic decrease .",
    "this behavior was found previously for disordered quantum wells and physically derives from thermal escape from local potential minima.@xcite we have shown that for disordered chains , the details of this behavior and the temperature range over which the anomaly takes place can be understood from the specific features of the exciton energy spectrum in the vicinity of the lower band edge : it is formed of manifolds of states localized on well separated segments of the chain and higher states that are extended over several segments .",
    "the migration of excitons between different segments augmented via intermediate jumps to higher states , is responsible for the non - monotonic behavior found in our simulations .",
    "interestingly , such a non - monotonic behavior of the stokes shift has recently been observed for the linear aggregates of the cyanine dye thiats in a glassy host.@xcite    we also found that the temperature dependence of the decay time of the total fluorescence intensity is very sensitive to the initial excitation conditions . for broadband resonant excitation",
    ", the fluorescence decay time decreases upon increasing the temperature .",
    "the reason is that the initially created population of superradiant states is transferred to higher ( dark ) states .",
    "it is the time of this transfer that determines the fluorescence decay time .",
    "as this transfer time decreases with growing temperature , a decreasing fluorescence lifetime is found .",
    "because fluorescence experiments are hard to perform under resonant excitation , it will be difficult to observe this effect of intraband redistribution in fluorescence .",
    "it would be of interest , however , to study its effect on resonantly excited photon echo experiments.@xcite    in the case of off - resonance blue - tail excitation ( the condition that is usually met in fluorescence decay experiments ) , the fluorescence decay time goes up with growing temperature , showing a nearly linear growth after a low - temperature plateau .",
    "the extent of the plateau depends on both the absorption bandwidth and on the ratio of the rates for exciton hopping and radiative emission .",
    "this behavior , a decay time that grows with temperature , with a possible plateau at low temperatures , agrees with fluorescence experiments performed on the j - bands of linear molecular aggregates .",
    "it is of particular interest to note that a nearly linear dependence has been observed for aggregates of bic@xcite and thiats@xcite .",
    "based on the density of states of homogeneous exciton systems , it has been suggested that such a linear dependence could only occur for two - dimensional systems.@xcite it follows from our results that in the presence of disorder , a ubiquitous ingredient for molecular aggregates , one - dimensional exciton systems may exhibit such a linear temperature dependence as well . in a separate paper,@xcite",
    "we will show that using the model analyzed in the present paper , it is possible to obtain good quantitative fits to the absorption spectrum , the temperature dependent stokes shift , as well as the temperature dependent fluorescence lifetime measured for aggregates of the dye thiats.@xcite                                                                                                    this type of exciton diffusion was recently suggested to explain the temperature - dependent trapping of excitons in linear molecular aggregates , see a.v .",
