    "the kuiper belt consists of a large number of small objects in heliocentric orbits beyond neptune .",
    "the existence of the kuiper belt was suggested on theoretical grounds by edgeworth ( 1943 ) and kuiper ( 1951 ) , but it was not until 1992 that the first kuiper belt object ( kbo ) was detected ( jewitt & luu  1993 ) . to date , more than @xmath11 kbos are known .",
    "they are thought to be relics of the sun s accretion disk , and to hold signatures of the planetary migration process . their physical properties , including their mass - distribution , compositions , and binary - fraction may thus hold the key to our understanding of the formation and evolution of the early solar system .",
    "a comprehensive review is provided by luu & jewitt  ( 2002 ) .",
    "the properties of kuiper belt binaries place important constraints on theories of solar system evolution . in particular , the distributions of separations and mass ratios are a unique signature of the binary formation process . over the past decade , more than @xmath12 resolved kuiper belt binaries have been discovered and studied ( noll et al .  2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "these can be broadly divided into two groups ( noll et al .",
    "the first consists of small satellites in orbits about larger kbos .",
    "these systems are believed to have formed through a large collision , followed by tidal evolution , much like the earth - moon and pluto - charon systems ( hartmann & davis  1975 ; cameron & ward  1976 ; mckinnon  1989 ) .",
    "the second - more abundant - group , consists of comparable mass , large separation binaries .",
    "these are inconsistent with the classical formation mechanisms , and have prompted an abundance of new theoretical models ( weidenschilling  2002 ; goldreich et al .",
    "2002 ; funato et al .",
    "2004 ; astakov et al .  2005 ; lee et al .  2007 ; schlichting & sari  2008 ; gamboa surez et al .",

    "recently , sheppard & jewitt  ( 2004 ) postulated the existence of a third group of kuiper belt binaries . by following the light curves of kbos",
    ", they were able to identify an unresolved , comparable - mass small - separation binary - candidate , 2001  qb@xmath6 , based on its variability , photometric range , and period .",
    "their analysis indicates that at least @xmath3 of all large kbos may in fact be unresolved close - binary systems .",
    "our current interpretation of the observed light curves of kbos relies on the classical theory of the equilibrium figures of rotation .",
    "the equilibrium configurations of rotating fluid bodies is a classical problem that was first investigated by newton in the context of the figure of the earth .",
    "newton showed that the slow rotation of the earth causes it to become a slightly oblate spheroid . in 1742 , maclaurin generalized the problem , by relaxing the assumption of slow rotation .",
    "he derived a general relation between the velocity of rotation and the eccentricity of the resulting equilibrium spheroid .",
    "maclaurin s relation implies that for any given angular velocity , two equilibrium solutions may be found , with different eccentricities .",
    "decades later , jacobi ( 1834 ) realized that triaxial ellipsoids are also possible equilibrium configurations of homogeneous rotating masses .",
    "the study of possible equilibrium configurations of binary systems was introduced by roche ( 1847 ) .",
    "roche considered the equilibrium form of a satellite rotating about a rigid sphere in a circular keplerian orbit .",
    "the satellite is deformed both by rotation and by the tides exerted by its spherical companion .",
    "a more accurate approach was later taken by darwin ( 1906 ) , who revisited the problem , allowing for mutual deformations of both bodies .",
    "solutions to darwin s problem may be found only in the limit of equal mass ratio ( @xmath13 ) or extreme mass ratio ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "both the roche and darwin solutions rely on the assumption that the equilibrium configurations are triaxial ellipsoids . a thorough review , analytic derivation , and stability analysis of these classical equilibrium configurations can be found in chandrasekhar  ( 1969 ) .    in modern astrophysical research ,",
    "these classical roche ellipsoidal approximations are used in the study of a wide range of contact - binaries , including binaries in the solar system . weidenschilling ( 1980 )",
    "used equal - mass darwin models to fit the observed light curves of asteroids 624  hektor and 216  kleopatra . in 1984 , leone et al .",
    "analytically constructed arbitrary mass - ratio roche ellipsoidal models .",
    "when computing a roche binary model for an arbitrary mass ratio , each component is in turn assumed to be spherical while the ellipsoidal configuration of its companion is calculated .",
    "leone et al .",
    "( 1984 ) used their theoretical photometric - range as a function of the angular velocity to constrain the mass ratios and densities of observed variable asteroids .",
    "cellino et al .",
    "( 1985 ) explicitly computed the light curves arising from the equilibrium roche models of leone et al . , and compared them with an observed sample of asteroid light curves to constrain their orbital parameters and densities .",
    "jewitt & sheppard  ( 2002 ) used the observed period and photometric range of kbo 20000  varuna to consider possible ( single ) jacobi ellipsoid and roche binary models for this object .",
    "takahashi & ip  ( 2004 ) computed the light curves arising from roche ellipsoidal configurations , to confirm the nature of the suspected binary kbo 2001  qg@xmath6 .",
    "lacerda & jewitt  ( 2007 ) constructed a library of jacobi - ellipsoid and roche - binary light curves , and investigated the nature and densities of four variable kbos ( 20000  varuna , 2003  el@xmath15 , 2001  qg@xmath6 , and 2000  gn@xmath16 ) and of the trojan asteroid 624  hektor .",
    "descamps  ( 2008 ) applied roche binary models to a sample of variable asteroids .",
    "all of the binary models mentioned above rely on the assumptions of the roche approximation , namely that each component is deformed by the tides of a _ spherical _ companion , and that the resulting configurations are ellipsoids rotating in keplerian orbits . in this paper",
    "we present new numerical computations of the equilibrium configurations of tidally locked homogeneous binaries , orbiting in circular orbits .",
    "we self - consistently take into account the tidal and rotational deformations of _ both _ components , and relax the assumptions of ellipsoidal configurations and keplerian rotation . for comparable - mass small - separation binaries ,",
    "departures from ellipsoidal configurations and keplerian rotation become significant .",
    "numerical solutions of the equilibrium configurations were previously computed for the cases of general mass ratio homogeneous binaries ( hachisu & eriguchi  1984a ) and for equal - mass polytropic binaries ( hachisu & eriguchi  1984b ) .",
    "these previous works expanded the local gravitational potentials in terms of legendre polynomials , which were used to approximate the potential on the surface of the two components . in our models",
    "we explicitly compute the local gravitational and rotational potentials on the surface of the two bodies , and use a newton - raphson based scheme to converge to an equilibrium solution , for which the surface of each of the components is an equipotential surface .",
    "we then use our numerical solutions to calculate the light - curves that these equilibrium configurations exhibit if placed in the kuiper belt , and demonstrate how these models can be used by fitting the observed light curve of kuiper belt binary 2001  qg@xmath6 .    in our computations",
    "we make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the bodies gravity dominates over their internal strength , so that they take the forms of rotating _ fluid _",
    "binaries appropriate for their angular velocity .",
    "the ratio of the material rigidity to self - gravity determines a size scale above which bodies may be considered gravity - dominated . for rigid monoliths ,",
    "this size scale is @xmath17  km .",
    "however , many of the smaller solar - system bodies are expected to be `` rubble - piles '' , for which the effective rigidity is reduced ( goldreich & sari  2009 ; and references therein ) .",
    "rubble piles larger than a few hundred kilometers are likely to be gravity dominated . in addition , over the age of the solar system , even smaller bodies will gradually take the forms dictated by gravity .",
    "second , we assume that the densities of the two binary components are equal . while this is likely the case for binaries formed through collisions , it is not necessarily true for binaries created via three - body interactions or due to dynamical friction . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "when the density ratio is infinite , one of the bodies is effectively compressed into a point mass while the other takes a form similar to the classical roche solution .",
    "these two limiting cases therefore span the range of possible configurations for different density - ratios .",
    "third , we assume that the binaries are tidally locked , so that their orbital and spin frequencies are equal , and their orbits circularized .",
    "if the orbital and spin velocities differ , the tidal bulge is carried ahead ( or lags behind ) the companion .",
    "torques then act to re - align the system , inducing oscillations about the equilibrium aligned configuration .",
    "internal dissipation damps these oscillations , and results in synchronized circular orbits . for the fiducial physical properties of large kbos ( @xmath18  km , @xmath19  g  cm  @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 )",
    ", such synchronization is expected to occur on time scales that are shorter than the age of the solar system for binaries forming with initial separations @xmath23 ( goldreich & sari  2009 ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the numerical method that we use to compute the equilibrium configurations as a function of the mass ratio and angular velocity .",
    "additional details are provided in appendix  a. in section  3 we discuss the equilibrium figures of rotation .",
    "we first use analytic approximations to clarify the nature of the equilibrium solutions and the evolution surrounding the `` roche limit '' . we then present exact solutions for the equilibrium configurations using our numerical approach . in section  4 we show that our equilibrium configurations are generally non - ellipsoidal , and deviate from pure keplerian rotation .",
    "we explain how the angular momentum depends on the mass ratio , angular velocity and tidal deformations . in section  5",
    "we compute the light curves that arise from the numerical configurations ( the numerical procedure used to compute the light curves is described in appendix  b ) .",
    "we explain how the reflection properties of the materials affect the observed variability , and demonstrate the differences between our light curves and those resulting from the classical roche approximations .",
    "finally , in section  6 , we use our models to fit the observed properties of kuiper belt binary 2001  qg@xmath6 , and to derive the physical properties and bulk density of this system .",
    "we summarize in section  7 .",
    "we are interested in finding the self - consistent equilibrium configuration of tidally - locked homogeneous binaries , rotating in circular orbits .",
    "we assume that the bodies are strengthless , so that their equilibrium configurations are determined by the conditions that the total ( gravitational @xmath24 rotational ) potential is constant along the surface of each of the bodies ( but may differ between the two bodies ) .",
    "the parameters that determine the equilibrium configurations are the mass ratio @xmath25 ; the separation between the components @xmath26 ; and the scaled angular velocity , @xmath27 . here",
    "we treat the separation and angular velocity as two independent parameters , and solve for the total mass of the system . for",
    "non - spherical configurations , the mass , separation , and angular velocity are not related through kepler s law , and our choice of parameters allows us to conveniently explore the non - keplerian nature of the solutions .",
    "our numerical procedure is described in detail in  [ equations ] .",
    "we summarize the numerical scheme below .",
    "we parametrize the surface of each body by specifying the distance from its center to the surface along @xmath28 preset angular directions , @xmath29 .",
    "we associate each of the @xmath28 surface - points with the small surface area surrounding it , and with a `` mass - cone '' stretching from the center to this surface area .",
    "the mass in the @xmath30th cone is then @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the solid angle that the cone occupies .",
    "we distribute the @xmath28 points evenly , so that each cone covers an equal solid angle as viewed from the center of the body .",
    "the potential at a point located on the surface is then the sum of the gravitational potential induced by the mass in all cones of both components , and the rotational potential about the common center of mass . for a model with @xmath33 points sampling the surface of @xmath34 , and @xmath35 points sampling the surface of @xmath36 ,",
    "our goal is to solve for the @xmath37 values of @xmath38 for which the total potential along the surface of each body is constant .",
    "the value of the potential may differ between the two bodies .",
    "we explicitly compute the gravitational and rotational potentials ( see  [ equations ] ) .",
    "our algorithm solves for @xmath39 variables , namely the values of the distances @xmath38 defining the surfaces of the bodies , and the values of the constant potentials along their surfaces , @xmath40 on @xmath34 and @xmath41 on @xmath36 .",
    "the equations that we solve are the @xmath37 conditions of constant potential , and the additional constrains provided by the given mass ratio @xmath0 , and separation @xmath26 , @xmath42 ( see  [ equations ] ) , where @xmath43 is the center of mass position of @xmath44 , along the direction separating the two components .",
    "we use a newton - raphson scheme to solve for the variables , @xmath45 that satisfy equations  ( [ f ] ) .",
    "we start with an initial guess for the configurations , and in each iteration correct the current guess by a small amount @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the jacobian derivatives matrix .",
    "we compute the jacobian analytically , and iterate the newton - raphson scheme until the solution has converged so that @xmath48 to within some numerical threshold , and the correction @xmath49 is small compared to @xmath50 .",
    "we define the @xmath51 direction to be pointing from the more massive component to its companion , and the @xmath52 direction to be parallel to the angular velocity vector .",
    "we assume that the equilibrium configurations have reflection symmetries about the @xmath53 and @xmath54 planes .",
    "we therefore distribute our @xmath28 points on the surface of a quarter - sphere . in the discussion that follows , we use @xmath55 points on a quarter - sphere for each of the components .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief introduction to the basic physical concepts underlying the derivation of equilibrium figures of rotations . we start by introducing the properties of single rotating maclaurin spheroids .",
    "we then proceed to examine the properties of infinitesimal spheroids orbiting a massive companion .",
    "while the exact equilibrium configuration of a satellite may be far from spheroidal , this exercise captures the basic properties of the equilibrium figures of binary systems .",
    "we then proceed to examine triaxial ellipsoids .",
    "we write the equations for the single jacobi ellipsoids , and then study infinitesimal triaxial ellipsoids satellites in binary systems .",
    "in section  [ numres ] we present our numerical results for the general equilibrium configuration of mutually deformed binaries .",
    "our numerical configurations deviate from pure ellipsoidal forms .",
    "we discuss the properties of our solutions and compare them with the previous estimates based on the roche ellipsoids in section  [ discussion ] .      in his classical derivation of the rotational distortion of the earth ,",
    "newton argued that since the earth is in equilibrium , the weights of liquid filling two canals , one stretching from the center of the earth to the equator , and the other from the center to the pole , must be equal .",
    "this is equivalent to demanding that the equator and the pole are a part of the same equipotential surface .",
    "newton further pointed out that since the accelerations associated with both gravity and rotation are proportional to the distance from the center of the earth , these weights ( or , equivalently , the surface potentials measured relative to the center ) are given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the height of the surface , and @xmath58 the acceleration on the surface .",
    "when maclaurin later addressed the general problem of spheroidal equilibrium configurations , he followed the arguments outlined by newton .",
    "for the potentials on the equator and at the pole we have ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the gravitational acceleration on the equator , @xmath61 is the gravitational acceleration at the pole , @xmath62 is the angular velocity , @xmath63 the semi - major axis @xmath64 of the spheroid , @xmath65 is the semi - minor axis , and @xmath66 is the eccentricity .    for a spheroid ,",
    "the gravitational acceleration along the equator and at the pole are analytical functions of the eccentricity @xmath66 , and are given by ( e.g. chandrasekhar  1969 ) ,    @xmath67    requiring that the potentials on the equator and at the pole are equal then yields , @xmath68 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] providing the relation between the eccentricity and angular velocity for maclaurin spheroids .",
    "let us now consider the problem of a binary system , comprised of a massive primary of mass @xmath69 orbited by an infinitesimal spheroidal ( @xmath70 ) satellite .",
    "here we assume that the system is tidally locked , so that the spin and orbital angular velocities are equal . for an infinitesimal satellite , the system s center of mass is effectively at the center of the massive primary , and we assume that the satellite is in a circular keplerian orbit .    the massive primary exerts a tidal force on the spheroidal satellite .",
    "on the point facing the primary , this results in an acceleration opposing the satellites own gravitational acceleration , of magnitude @xmath71 , where @xmath26 is the separation between the two components . on the polar axis ,",
    "the primary serves to compress the secondary , providing an acceleration along the polar axis of @xmath72 .    following the previous line of argument ,",
    "the potentials on the surface of the secondary can be readily computed .",
    "writing @xmath73 for the potential on the equatorial point facing the primary , and @xmath74 for the polar potential ,    [ spheroidal_v_om ] @xmath75    with @xmath76 .    demanding that these two potentials are equal , and assuming keplerian rotation , @xmath77 we now obtain @xmath78 which relates the eccentricity and rotational velocity of infinitesimal spheroids in binary systems .",
    "we note that the resulting spheroids are _ not _ genuine equilibrium configurations , because even for the eccentricities dictated by equation  ( [ spheroid - eccentricity ] ) , for which @xmath79 , the value of the potential varies along the surface the spheroids .",
    "figure  [ compv ] shows the equatorial ( @xmath73 ) and polar ( @xmath74 ) potentials ( relative to the satellite center , see equation  [ spheroidal_v_om ] ) , as functions of eccentricity for three representative values of the angular velocity .",
    "the solid curves show the equatorial potential , and the dashed curves show the polar potential .",
    "equilibrium configurations arise where the two potentials obtain equal values and the curves cross .",
    "this is shown by the filled circles in figure  [ compv ] .",
    "for low angular velocities ( panel a ) there are two eccentricity solutions for a given angular velocity .",
    "the lower eccentricity solution is stable",
    ". a flattening of the equilibrium spheroid will result in restoring forces acting to raise the poles and compress the equator , and vice versa .",
    "the higher eccentricity solution is unstable .",
    "a flattening of the equilibrium spheroid will result in forces that act to flatten it even further , driving the eccentricity away from the equilibrium value .",
    "figure  [ compv ] shows that the polar potential is always positive ( relative to the satellite center ) , and the forces on the pole are therefore always directed toward the center .",
    "however , the equatorial potential on the point facing the primary becomes negative at large eccentricities , resulting in an outward force acting to unbind the material .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that there is a limiting angular velocity for which only one solution exist .",
    "this is known as the `` roche limit '' configuration . for even higher angular velocities ( panel c ) ,",
    "the potential at the pole is higher than the potential at the equator for _ any _ eccentricity , and no equilibrium solution can be found .",
    "note that at the `` roche limit '' , the potential is still positive , and the material remains bound .",
    "the roche limit is therefore crossed before the `` roche lobe '' is filled .",
    "for larger values of angular velocity , the force on the pole is _ always _ larger than the force on the equator ( see panel c ) , and the configuration is therefore driven to an ever increasing eccentricity .",
    "eventually , the potential on the equator will become negative , resulting in mass shedding along the equator .",
    "even though the roche limit occurs before the roche lobe is filled , once the roche limit is crossed the configuration will evolve to shed mass .",
    "while our example assumed an unrealistic spheroidal configuration for the infinitesimal satellite , we find that it captures much of the physics at play in homogeneous binary systems .",
    "this includes the existence of two solutions , one of which is stable and the other not ; the existence of a `` roche limit '' that is reached before the roche lobe is filled ; and the understanding that despite this fact , beyond the roche limit mass shedding will eventually occur . as we discuss below , the same principles apply for triaxial configurations .",
    "triaxial ellipsoids ( @xmath80 ) are defined by two eccentricities , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . to find the equilibrium configurations of single triaxial rotating ellipsoids",
    ", we demand that the surface potential along the three principal axes be equal .",
    "this provides two equations , which can be solved for the two eccentricities .",
    "the gravitational accelerations along the principle axes of a triaxial ellipsoid are ( e.g. chandrasekhar  1969 ) , @xmath83 where @xmath84    a comparison of the potential along the semi - major axis @xmath63 , and the other equatorial axis @xmath85 , yields @xmath86 whereas for the minor ( polar ) axis @xmath87 , @xmath88 these two equations can be solved numerically for the values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 given an angular velocity @xmath62 .",
    "these solutions are the jacobi ellipsoids .",
    "if an infinitesimal triaxial ellipsoid is rotating about a massive spherical primary , the potential must be modified to include the tidal and gravitational contributions of the primary . in this case , @xmath91 and @xmath92    assuming keplerian rotation ( equation  [ kepler ] ) , we may express the above equations in terms of the eccentricities @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and the angular velocity only ,    [ om - roche ] @xmath93    these are the roche ellipsoidal solutions for an extreme mass ratio ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "figure  [ rochee ] shows the roche ellipsoid solutions for @xmath14 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the angular velocities given by equations  [ om - roche]a and b ( dark and gray contours ) as functions of the eccentricities @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "equilibrium solutions exist when the two equations yield equal values of angular velocity .",
    "examples of equilibrium configurations are shown by the filled symbols .",
    "the circles correspond to @xmath94 , and the triangle to @xmath95 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the positions of the equilibrium solutions ( solid curve ) .",

    "two equilibrium solution are found ( see filled circles ) .",
    "panel ( c ) shows that there exists a maximal value of angular velocity for which only one solution can be found .",
    "this is the `` roche limit '' ellipsoid , occurring at @xmath95 ( for @xmath14 ) , shown here by the filled triangle . for values of angular velocity beyond the `` roche limit ''",
    ", no solution can be found for _ any _ combination of eccentricities .",
    "we have computed the equilibrium configurations of rotating binary systems for mass ratios , @xmath0 , between  @xmath1   and  @xmath2 . for each value of @xmath0 , we found solutions starting at a very low angular velocity ( large separation ) , for which the rotational and tidal deformations are small , and following a sequence of increasing angular velocity , ending at the roche limit where an equilibrium solution can no longer be found .    in this section we present examples of our numerical results for the equilibrium figures of rotation .",
    "these results were obtained using the numerical method described in section  [ method ] , which allows the bodies to take _ any _ form that is symmetric about the @xmath53 and @xmath54 planes - axis , and the rotation is about the @xmath97-axis . ] .",

    "consider the gravitational potential that a primary of mass @xmath69 creates on the surface of its companion , which has a semi - major axis @xmath63 , and is located at a distance @xmath26 . on the axis connecting the two components , @xmath100.\\ ] ]",
    "the first term is constant , and does not produce any forces .",
    "the second terms gives rise to the circular orbital motion .",
    "the third term is the lowest order tidal force , which produces the symmetric deformations that were considered in the analysis of the roche equilibrium ellipsoidal configurations ( section  [ triaxials ] ) .",
    "the fourth term is the first _",
    "asymmetric _ correction to the tidal potential , and is a factor @xmath101 smaller than the previous term .",
    "asymmetric deformation are therefore always small at large separations .",
    "in addition , the primary is not spherical , as it is also deformed by rotation and by tidal interactions .",

    "we have carried out computations of the light curves of kuiper belt binaries , based on the equilibrium figures of rotation presented in section  [ numres ] .",
    "the light curves depend on the relative positions of the observed binary , the observer , and the light source ; on the inclination of the orbit relative to the plane of the sky ; and on the reflecting properties of the materials composing the surface of the observed system .    for binaries in the kuiper belt the observed geometry is simple . at a distance of @xmath138  au , the observer ( on earth ) , light source ( the sun ) , and the observed kuiper belt binary are almost aligned , so that the `` phase - angle '' between the line - of - sight and the kbo - sun direction always remains small ( @xmath139 ) .    the reflecting properties of kbos are not well constrained .",
    "here we consider two simple options .",
    "first , we consider uniform reflection , which produces an observed intensity proportional to the projected area on the plane of the sky . for the given geometry",
    ", this can result from simple `` backscatter '' reflection .",
    "second , we study the case of diffuse ( `` lambertian '' ) reflection , for which light is reflected equally in all directions , and the observed intensity from a surface area depends only on the cosine of the angle between the sun and the normal to the reflecting surface .",
    "the absolute intensity of light as seen from earth also depends on the distances between the sun , the kbo , and earth , and on the kbo s size and albedo .",
    "here we ignore the absolute intensities and instead focus on the normalized relative light - curves .",
    "we tile the surface of a given equilibrium configuration with surface triangles , and then compute the light intensity for a given orbital phase , inclination , and reflection law , taking into account possible obscurations of different tiles .",
    "the numerical procedure is described in detail in  [ lcequations ] .",
    "we have verified that our results reproduce previous light - curve computations given similar configurations ( see appendix  [ sanity ] ) .    in figure  [ lcex ]",
    "we show an example of a light curve computed for a mass ratio @xmath140 , an angular velocity @xmath141 , and an edge - on orbit .",

    "both light curves have been normalized so that the intensity equals @xmath2 at the maximum ( note that for a given albedo the absolute intensity is larger for backscatter reflection ) .",
    "the light curve shape depends on the orbital parameters . in large separation ( small @xmath62 ) binaries ,",
    "the eclipses only span a small fraction of the orbit , and the light curves generally appear to be slowly varying outside of the eclipses , as the projected area gradually changes . in close binaries ( large @xmath62 )",
    ", such `` plateaus '' do not exist between the two eclipses . for the mass ratio considered in figure  [ lcex ]",
    ", @xmath141 corresponds to a close binary , and the eclipses indeed appear to span most of the orbit .",
    "the mass ratio determines the depth of the eclipses . even for the case of backscatter reflection ,",
    "for which the intensity is proportional to the projected area , eclipses are deepest for equal mass components . in this case",
    "the tidal deformations are largest , and the projected area is a strong function of orbital phase .",
    "the deformations for extreme - mass ratio binaries are smaller ( and more spheroidal ) , and the relative depth of the eclipses is thus smaller . for diffuse reflection the impact of",
    "the mass ratio is even larger .",
    "one of the most indicative differences between backscatter and diffuse reflections , is the relative depth of the two minima . in backscatter",
    "reflection , which is sensitive only to the total projected area , the depths of the two minima are always equal , regardless of whether the small body is in front of the large body or vice versa .",
    "however for diffuse reflection , which is sensitive to the surface curvature , the two minima exhibit different depths .",
    "when the small body in viewed in front of the large body , a larger fraction of the surface is inclined relative to the light source , and so the reflected intensity is smaller .",
    "an additional parameter that affects the depth of the eclipses is the orbital inclination .",
    "figure  [ lcex ] shows the maximal variation that obtains for an edge - on orbit .",
    "higher inclinations result in smaller variations .",
    "next we examine the differences between light curves computed assuming the roche approximation and light curves computed using our numerical solution . as an example , we consider the light curve of an equal mass binary , with an angular velocity @xmath142 . in figure  [ comproche ]",
    "we show the ratio between the light intensity resulting from the roche configuration appropriate to this angular velocity , and our non - ellipsoidal non - keplerian configurations .",
    "both light curves were computed using the numerical procedure described in appendix  b , assuming edge - on inclination and diffuse reflection .",
    "they differ only by the equilibrium forms .",
    "the phase is defined so that the maxima of each individual light curve is obtained at @xmath135 and @xmath143 .",

    "larger albedo variations are likely to be associated with color variations ( e.g. iapetus ) .",

    "next , they consider the possibility of an elongated shape . sj04",
    "use the observed photometric range to infer an axis ratio @xmath154 ( assuming the intensity is proportional to the projected area ) .",

    "this maximum variation occurs for a jacobi ellipsoid with @xmath159 and @xmath160 ( chandrasekhar  1969 ; farinella et al .  1981 ) and more elongated objects are dynamically unstable .",
    "however , we note here that the maximum variation quoted in sj04 applies to backscatter reflection , whereas for diffuse ( lambert ) reflection these axis - ratios yield a variation of @xmath161  mag .",
    "sj04 also note that the rotational period of 2001  qg@xmath6 is too long to cause significant elongation for reasonable densities .",

    "we create a library of light curves for comparison with observations .",

    "in this paper we introduce a numerical method for computing the self - consistent equilibrium configurations of tidally - locked homogeneous binaries , rotating in circular orbits .",
    "the equilibrium configurations depend on the mass ratio , angular velocity , and separation between the two components .",
    "we explicitly compute the gravitational and rotational potentials on the surface of the two components , and use a newton - raphson - based scheme to converge to an equilibrium solution , for which the surfaces of each of the bodies is an equipotential surface .",
    "our numerical procedure is described in detail in section  [ method ] and  [ equations ] .    in section  [ results ]",
    "we discuss the properties of the equilibrium figures of rotation .",
    "we begin with simple analytic approximations that we use to study the characteristics of the equilibrium solutions .",
    "we confirm that for low angular velocities ( large separations ) , two equilibrium configurations always exist , differing by their eccentricity .",

    ", the material is still bound , and so the roche limit is crossed before the roche lobe is filled .",

    "we find numerical solutions for the equilibrium configurations for mass ratios , @xmath0 , between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for each value of @xmath0 we find solutions starting at a very low angular velocity ( large separation ) , for which the rotational and tidal deformations are small , and following a sequence of increasing angular velocity , terminating at the roche limit where an equilibrium configuration can no longer be found .",

    "ellipsoidal fits are generally good approximations at large separations and for extreme mass ratios . even at small separations and for comparable masses , the typical rms deviation between a numerical solution and an ellipsoid fitted to it is @xmath207 .",

    "we inspect the angular momenta of the equilibrium configurations .",
    "we decompose the angular momenta into `` spin '' and `` orbit '' components , and explain the trends in the angular momentum - angular velocity parameter - space . as the angular velocity increases , it shifts from being orbit - dominated to being spin - dominated , creating a minimum in the angular momentum .",
    "we discuss the increasing value of this minimum with increasing mass ratio , and demonstrate the `` drift '' of the angular momentum to higher values as the tidal deformations grow .    in section  [ seclc ] ,",
    "we calculate the light curves that arise from our numerically computed equilibrium configurations , if placed in the kuiper belt .",
    "in addition to the configurations , the observed light curves also depend on the inclination of the orbit relative to the plane of the sky , and on the reflecting properties of the surface of the objects .",
    "we consider two possibilities for the reflecting properties .",
    "first we consider an observed intensity that is proportional to the projected area on the plane of the sky , as is appropriate for backscatter reflection from kuiper belt objects .",
    "second , we consider the possibility of diffuse ( lambert ) reflection , in which the reflected light from a surface area is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the sun and the normal to the surface .",
    "we note , that backscatter reflection is sensitive only to the total projected area , and therefore always yields two equal minima",
    ". however , diffuse reflection , which is sensitive to the surface curvature , generally produces two minima of different depths .",
    "when the small body is viewed `` in front '' of the large body , a larger fraction of the surface is inclined .",

    "we distribute the @xmath28 points evenly in @xmath217 and in @xmath221 to ensure that each point covers an equal solid angle @xmath32 , as measured from the center of the body .",
    "we assume that the equilibrium configurations are symmetric about the @xmath53 and @xmath54 planes .",
    "this assumption allows us to only sample a quarter of a sphere when mapping the surface of each body .",
    "each surface patch corresponds to a `` mass - cone '' stretching from the patch to the center of the body . for homogeneous bodies , the mass within the @xmath30th `` cone '' , stretching from @xmath222 to the surface where @xmath223 , is @xmath224 .",
    "the total mass in the body is @xmath225 .",
    "the potential at a point located on the surface of a body is the sum of the gravitational potentials induced by the mass in all the cones in both components , and the rotational potential about the common center of mass .",
    "our goal is to solve for the values of @xmath38 , for which the total potential along the surface of each body is constant .",
    "while the surface of each body must be equipotential , the values of the potential may differ between the two bodies .      to compute the gravitational potential at some surface point ,",
    "we must first evaluate the distance between this point and a mass element @xmath226 inducing the potential .",
    "we can write the distance between two points that belong to @xmath34 or @xmath36 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 as @xmath229 with    [ abeq ] @xmath230    where @xmath231 +   \\cos(\\theta_i ) \\cos(\\theta_j)\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath232 the plus ( minus ) sign in equation  [ aeq ] ( [ beq ] ) should be used if @xmath233 is in @xmath34 and @xmath30 is in @xmath36 , and the minus ( plus ) sign should be used if @xmath233 is in @xmath36 and @xmath30 in @xmath34 . if both points are in the same mass , @xmath234 such that @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "given this distance , the gravitational potential due to the total mass in cone @xmath30 with extent @xmath38 , at a point @xmath228 is @xmath237 where @xmath191 and @xmath238 are the functions of @xmath239 specified by equation  [ abeq ] , and @xmath240 is the solid angle covered by cone @xmath30 .    for the rotational potential at a point @xmath228 we can write @xmath241      consider a model with @xmath33 points sampling the surface of @xmath34 , and @xmath35 points sampling the surface of @xmath36 .",
    "the conditions of constant - potentials provides @xmath37 equation . for points @xmath242 on the surface of @xmath44 these equations",
    "can be written as , @xmath243 the variables in these equations are the @xmath37 values @xmath38 , and the values of the constant potentials on the surfaces of the two components , @xmath40 on @xmath34 , and @xmath41 on @xmath36 .",
    "two additional equations are therefore required to solve the problem .",
    "one of these equations is the constrain provided by the given mass ratio , @xmath0 , @xmath244 where @xmath245 and @xmath246 are the solid angles occupied by cones on @xmath34 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the last equation is for the distance between the individual center - of - masses of the two bodies , @xmath247    to summarize , the set of equation to be solved can be written as @xmath48 , where @xmath248 is the @xmath39 dimensional vector , @xmath249 the upper parentheses denote the size of each vector .    in the numerical procedure , we start with an initial guess for the configurations , and iterate using a newton - raphson method ( but see  [ ls ] ) , correcting the values of our variables @xmath250 by @xmath251 , where @xmath47 is the jacobian derivatives matrix .",
    "we compute the derivatives analytically .",
    "we iterate the newton - raphson scheme until the solution has converged , so that @xmath48 to within some numerical threshold , and the correction @xmath49 is small compared to @xmath50 .      as mentioned in section  [ a1 ] , we assume that the equilibrium configurations are symmetric about the @xmath53 and @xmath54 planes .",
    "we therefore distribute @xmath28 points on the surface of a @xmath252-sphere , between @xmath253 and @xmath143 , and between @xmath254 and @xmath135 .    when computing the potential produced by the @xmath30th cone with orientation ( @xmath255 , the contributions of the three symmetric cones , at @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 must also be included .",
    "we find that the numerical efficiency is much increased if instead of using equation  [ separation ] for the distance between the center - of - masses , we use two equation ,    @xmath260    we therefore solve an over - constrained problem , with @xmath261 equations for @xmath39 variables .",
    "we substitute the newton - raphson matrix division @xmath46 , with a so - called `` left - matrix division '' @xmath262 , which is the solution , in the least squares sense , to the over - constrained system of equations , @xmath263 .",
    "we use the values of @xmath49 derived using this modified newton - raphson scheme to correct the current solution , and iterate to convergence .",
    "we consider the accuracy of our numerical method , as it applies to our best fit solution to the observed light curve of kuiper belt binary 2001  qg@xmath264 .",
    "this model has @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath265 .    given these parameters ,",
    "we compare models constructed with various sampling resolutions , namely @xmath266 and @xmath183 points on a quarter - sphere .",
    "we begin by estimating the `` true '' equilibrium configurations , by extrapolating the functions @xmath267 to @xmath268 for each direction @xmath269 . for each @xmath28",
    "we then compute the rms difference between the numerical solution and this `` true '' configuration , @xmath270 , where @xmath271 are the distances from the center - of - mass to the surface in the numerical solution , and @xmath272 are the distances from the center - of - mass to the surface in the extrapolated , `` true '' solution .    since each solution is given at different azimuthal and polar angles , we first interpolate the center - to - surface distances of the high - resolution solutions onto the directions in which the lowest - resolution solution is known .",
    "we use these interpolated versions of the high - resolution solutions both to estimate the true configurations and to compute the rms differences .",
    "figure  [ accuracy ] shows our results for the rms difference versus the number of points .",
    "the filled symbols are for the more massive primary , and the empty symbols are for the lower mass companion .",
    "for example , the rms difference between the primary solution with @xmath183 points and the `` true '' solution is @xmath273 .",
    "we note , that the interpolation process introduces some errors that may increases this rms .",
    "these values can be compared with the rms difference between the numerical solution and the best fit ellipsoid ( see section  4.1 and figure  [ non - e ] ) which are @xmath274 and @xmath275 for the primary and companion , respectively .",
    "to compute the observed luminosity , we tile the surface of a given binary - configuration with triangles , typically two triangles for each of the @xmath28 points used when computing the equilibrium configuring . for the computations presented in sections  [ results ] and  [ discussion ] , which contain @xmath55-point on a quarter - sphere , this corresponds to @xmath276 triangular tiles on each of the components .",
    "we compute the @xmath277 coordinates of the vertices of the triangular tiles . given the orbital phase and inclination , we then rotate the coordinate system such that the positive @xmath97-direction points toward the observer .",
    "tiles with higher values of @xmath97 are closer to the observer , and may block tiles with lower values of @xmath97 from sight .",
    "we now sort the tiles of both bodies according to their mean @xmath97 values . for each tile , we compute the area projected on the @xmath53 plane , @xmath278 , and the angle between the normal to the tile surface and the sun , @xmath279 .",
    "we define a `` visibility '' function for each tile , @xmath280 , describing the fraction of the tile s projected surface that is visible to the observer . for each tile",
    ", we estimate the visibility function by searching for other tiles which may block it from sight .",
    "we start with the tile closest to the observer ( highest @xmath97 value ) , and search for possible overlaps between its @xmath53 position and the @xmath53 positions of all the lower-@xmath97 tiles .",
    "when an overlap exists , we reduce the visibility function of the lower tile , by an amount corresponding to the fraction of its area that overlaps with the higher tile , @xmath281 .",
    "we then repeat this procedure for every other tile , correcting the visibility of lower tiles .",
    "this provides an _ overestimate _ of the reduction in visibility , since several high tiles may cover the _ same _ part of a lower tile , resulting in a `` double - reduction '' of the same covered area .",
    "this error remains small due to the simple shapes considered here .",
    "the total observed light is given by @xmath282 for the case of backscatter reflection , and by @xmath283 for the case of diffuse ( lambertian ) reflection .",
    "to compute the light curve due to a given configuration viewed at a given inclination , this process must be repeated for a set of orbital phases between @xmath135 and @xmath284 .      to verify the accuracy of our light - curve computations",
    ", we compared our models against published results for similar configurations .",
    "in particular we focused on previous suggested models for qg@xmath264 .",
    "two previous published models exist , both using the roche ellipsoidal solutions .",
    "the first is by takahashi & ip ( 2004 ) , and the second by lacerda & jewitt ( 2007 ) .    according to takahashi & ip ( 2004 ) ,",
    "qg@xmath264 consists of two components with a mass ratio , @xmath285 .",
    "the primary has @xmath286 and @xmath287 , and a secondary has @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "the separation is @xmath168 times the primary s semi - major axis .",
    "the system is illustrated in figure  [ ticonf ] .",
    "takahashi & ip find that their best fit indicates a @xmath169 diffuse reflection plus @xmath170 backscatter ( uniform ) reflection .",
    "for these parameters , they infer a bulk density of @xmath171  g  @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ tilc ] shows the light curve that we compute given the parameters inferred by takahashi & ip , along with the observed data points ( left ) .",
    "a comparison of this light curve with that presented in figure  2 of takahashi & ip ( right ) , shows that our results are nicely consistent .    according to lacerda & jewitt ( 2007 ) , qg@xmath264 is a binary with a mass ratio @xmath290 .",
    "their primary has @xmath291 and @xmath292 , and their secondary @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "the separation is @xmath168 times the primary semi - major axis .",
    "this system is illustrated in figure  [ ljconf ] .",
    "note that lacerda & jewitt accepted this configuration even though the two components overlap .",
    "they argue that they chose to accept it , because of the inaccuracies imposed by the ellipsoidal and keplerian nature of the roche approximation , and due to our poor understanding of the formation mechanisms of such binaries .",
    "lacerda & jewitt find that backscatter reflection best fits the observed light curve .",
    "these parameters indicate a bulk density of @xmath177  g  @xmath10 . in figure  [ ljlc ]",
    "we display the light curve that we compute based on the parameters inferred by lacerda & jewitt ( 2007 ) .",
    "our light curves are again nicely consistent with those computed by lacerda & jewitt and shown in their figure  9 ( lower - left panel ) .",
