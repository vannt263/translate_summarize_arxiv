    "as is well known , neutron stars of high densities are ideal extra - terrestrial test beds for theories of nuclear matters , quark matters and high energy physics ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . for instance , the possible existence of the quark star ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a variant of the neutron star , could lend direct support to the theory of quark matter @xcite . besides , the relation between the mass and the radius of a neutron star could determine , up to certain accuracy , the equation of state ( eos ) of relevant nuclear matter through the process of inversion @xcite .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive study of observed data and statistics of neutron stars is likely to lead to fruitful results in the fields mentioned above .",
    "traditional means to gather information about neutron stars have so far relied on electromagnetic waves emitted from them",
    ". however , with the advent of gravitational wave detectors of various designs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , including resonant antennas ( e.g. exploper and niboe ) , ground - based interferometers ( e.g. ligo and virgo ) , and the space - based interferometer lisa , it is generally believed that neutron stars , as promising gravitational wave emitters , can be observed and analyzed in the gravitational wave channel within one or two decades .",
    "for example , it has been argued that the frequency of detection of gravitational waves emitted in the mergers of binary neutron stars could be as high as several hundreds per year in the near future @xcite . besides , gravitational waves could also be emitted during the formation of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "being spurred on by the possibility of inferring the internal structure of neutron stars from the gravitational wave signals emitted by them , researchers have been actively examining the peculiarities embedded in such signals @xcite .    despite that the evaluation of gravitational waves emitted in violent stellar activities such as binary mergers and asymmetric core collapse",
    "has indeed posed a grand challenge to researchers in numerical relativity , linearized theory of pulsating neutron stars pioneered by @xcite can still provide useful insight into such complex situations . by analogy of radiating electric circuits @xcite , linearized gravitational waves are analyzed in terms of quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) , which are damped harmonic pulsations with time dependence @xmath0 and are characterized by complex eigenfrequencies @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the qnm frequencies of a pulsating neutron star can reflect the physical characteristics of the star , such as its mass @xmath2 , radius @xmath3 and eos as well @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite also noted that the frequency @xmath4 and the damping time @xmath5 of the leading axial and polar @xmath6-modes of non - rotating neutron stars follow approximately the equations : @xmath7 , \\label{bbf1}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\tau } & \\approx & \\frac{1}{m}\\left[a_\\i \\left(\\frac{m}{r}\\right)^2+b_\\i\\left(\\frac{m}{r}\\right)+c_\\i \\right],\\label{bbf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are model - independent constants determined from curve fitting",
    ". these universal behaviors seem to undermine the possibility of inferring the characteristics of a neutron star from its @xmath6-mode qnms . instead , they are indicative of a common feature shared among neutron stars with different eos s .    to seek the physical mechanism underlying the universality in the gravitational wave of neutron stars , we showed in a recent paper @xcite that ( i ) the scaled complex eigenfrequencies @xmath13 of @xmath6-mode oscillations , to a good approximation , depend only on the compactness @xmath14 .",
    "( ii ) eqs .",
    "( [ bbf1 ] ) and ( [ bbf2 ] ) are equivalent to a single formula of @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are complex constants .",
    "( iii ) the universality indicated by ( [ tla ] ) is a direct reflection of the fact that the the mass distribution inside neutron stars with different eos s can be nicely approximated by the tolman vii model ( tviim ) proposed by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further pinpoint the crux of the mechanism leading to the universal behavior ( [ tla ] ) for axial @xmath6-mode pulsations .",
    "inspired by the success of tviim , we propose here yet another simple approximation , namely the centrifugal barrier approximation ( cba ) , in which the potential in the axial gravitational wave equation @xcite is replaced by a standard centrifugal barrier in the tortoise radius plus a constant determined from continuity of the potential at the stellar surface .",
    "the cba potential yields the correct asymptotic behavior of the actual potential at the center of the star and is a good global approximation as well .",
    "the wave function of the axial gravitational wave equation in cba then becomes exactly solvable .",
    "it is remarkable that the universal behavior ( [ tla ] ) can still be reproduced with cba using the tortoise radius of tviim star as an input .",
    "hence , the observed universality in neutron star axial pulsations is in fact ascribable to ( i ) the centrifugal potential at the center of the star ; ( ii ) the continuity of the potential ; and ( iii ) the tortoise radius of tviim star , which will be given explicitly in sect .",
    "2 of our paper .    to understand quantitatively the universal behavior ( [ tla ] )",
    ", we establish here a scaled co - ordinate logarithmic perturbation theory ( sclpt ) , which is a generalization of the logarithmic perturbation theory ( lpt ) formulated previously to study qnms of  dirty black holes \" @xcite . applying sclpt to cba and using the tortoise radius of tviim star",
    ", we obtain from first principle the numerical values of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in ( [ tla ] ) .",
    "the universal behavior ( [ tla ] ) is therefore substantiated analytically .",
    "while the cba star itself clearly displays universality as mentioned above , we can also obtain accurate qnm frequencies of individual realistic neutron stars from those of cba with sclpt .",
    "as a consequence , we are able to consider the eos - dependence of the scaled qnm frequency @xmath15 from the static structure of a star ( e.g. mass distribution ) , thereby paving the way for inferring the eos of a star from its gravitational wave spectra .",
    "thus , the universality and individuality in qnms of neutron stars constructed with different eos s are fully explored with sclpt developed in this paper .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in sect .  2 , after briefly reviewing the scaling behavior of the axial gravitational wave equation , we introduce cba and show that under such approximation qnms still manifest the generic behavior summarized in ( [ tla ] ) . in sect .",
    "3 we formulate sclpt to study how qnm frequencies are affected by changes in the potential and the tortoise radius of the star . in sect .",
    "4 we apply sclpt to expand the scaled qnm frequency @xmath15 as a quadratic function of the compactness of the star and in turn corroborate the universal behavior in ( [ tla ] ) . in sect .  5 sclpt is applied to investigate the eos - dependence of the scaled qnm frequency @xmath15 .",
    "we then conclude our paper in sect .  6 with a discussion studying the applicability of cba and sclpt to @xmath20 and trapped modes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unless otherwise stated , geometrized units in which @xmath21 are adopted in the present paper and numerical results are shown for the least damped mode of quadrupole gravitational waves .",

    "it is clearly shown that both the real and imaginary parts of the scaled frequency @xmath15 are well approximated by quadratic functions in compactness @xmath43 , as indicated by the dotted lines in the corresponding figures .",
    "this in turn leads to the universality discussed in sect .  1 .    to investigate the physical origin underlying the universality",

    "in fact , our conjecture is verified by fig .",
    "[ f3 ] where @xmath64 is plotted against @xmath65 for tviim and other realistic stars .    as the integral in ( [ inti_eq ] ) could not be evaluated analytically , we are not able to express @xmath66 in terms of simple functions of @xmath59 and hence it is not possible to find the analytical form of the wave function in nsrwe even inside the star .",
    "however , we could expand @xmath67 as a power series around the center of the star : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant dependent on @xmath43 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the leading term in the expansion of @xmath71 is nothing but a centrifugal barrier in @xmath72 .",
    "despite that the leading two terms of the expansion in ( [ vcea ] ) can nicely approximate the potential at the center of the star , it usually produces a discontinuity across the stellar surface .",
    "as qnms are sensitive to discontinuities , we have to adopt another potential @xmath73 given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is obtained from ( [ str ] ) .",
    "this potential is similar to the one in ( [ vcea ] ) around @xmath76 and , in addition , is continuous across the stellar surface .",
    "this scheme is termed the centrifugal barrier approximation ( cba ) in our paper .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that under cba the wave function of nsrwe inside the star is simply given by @xmath77 , e.g. for @xmath78 : @xmath79 here @xmath80^{1/2}\\ ] ] is the scaled effective wave number .",
    "in addition to its simplicity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , cba also yields qnms ( denoted by the solid line in the figure ) close to those of tviim and realistic neutron stars",
    ". therefore , qnms of cba manifest the universal behavior ( [ tla ] ) .",
    "this remarkable discovery is indeed the crux of the present paper .",
    "as the scaled potential in ( [ cbav ] ) is completely characterized by @xmath81 and @xmath63 , which is also a function of @xmath43 , the cause of the observed universality in neutron star axial pulsations then becomes obvious and understandable . in a nutshell ,",
    "the universality is attributable to ( i ) the centrifugal potential at the center of the star ; ( ii ) the continuity of the potential ; and ( iii ) the tortoise radius @xmath63 of tviim star .",
    "after locating the physical origin of the universality in qnms of neutron stars , we further consider the following questions : ( i ) can the coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in ( [ tla ] ) be obtained analytically from cba ?",
    "( ii ) can qnms of realistic stars be obtained from those of cba ?",
    "we hold positive views on these challenging issues . in this paper",
    ", we aim to develop a perturbative study to consider how changes in compactness and eos could affect the frequencies of the qnms of a star . in fact , the simplicity and generality of cba directly leads to a feasible perturbative analysis for qnms of neutron stars and in turn provides appropriate solutions to these two questions .",
    "as discussed above , axial oscillations of neutron stars are described by nsrwe with a potential term dependent on the distribution of energy - mass density and the pressure inside a star .",
    "qnms of these oscillations are the eigen - solution to ( [ kg_eq ] ) and , in addition , they are regular at the origin and satisfy the outgoing boundary condition at spatial infinity .",
    "it is well known that the wave function of qnms diverges at spatial infinity and is not amenable to standard perturbation theory ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to this end , we will generalize the logarithmic perturbation theory for qnms , previously formulated by @xcite to study how the qnms of a black hole respond to static perturbations such as a static mass shell , to consider qnms of neutron stars . in this case , the scaled nsrwe ( [ kg_sc ] ) that makes use of the scaled coordinate @xmath82 is obviously more amenable to perturbative expansion since outside the star @xmath83 depends only @xmath82 and is independent of the stellar mass .",
    "therefore , the method developed here is referred to as the scaled - coordinate logarithmic perturbation theory ( sclpt ) . in the subsequent discussion",
    ", we will show that shifts in scaled qnm frequencies can be expressed in terms of integrals with finite domains of integration .      to formulate a perturbative expansion for the qnm frequency",
    ", we introduce a formal perturbation parameter , @xmath84 , to measure the departure of the stellar configuration from an unperturbed one , which has a scaled circumferential ( tortoise ) radius @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , a scaled potential @xmath87 , and a qnm with a scaled frequency @xmath88 .",
    "analogous to other perturbation theories , we will assume that the qnm wave function is known .",
    "this assumption does not pose any problems to our current study because we will use the cba potential as the unperturbed system and , as mentioned above , the wave function can be obtained analytically . besides , @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be obtained from ( [ str ] ) and ( [ cbav ] ) , respectively .",
    "the subject of interest in this paper is to obtain the qnm frequency of a perturbed star whose potential function , as a function of @xmath89 , can be expressed as : @xmath90 for @xmath91 . here",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 are the circumferential and tortoise radii of the perturbed star , respectively , which are also functions of @xmath84 , with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    outside the star ,",
    "it is clear from ( [ sp ] ) that @xmath50 , as a function of @xmath96 , is independent of @xmath84 and hence @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "it is therefore more convenient to adopt the scaled tortoise coordinate @xmath89 and the scaled circumferential radius @xmath82 to describe wave propagation inside and outside the star , respectively .",
    "each of these radial coordinates has its own advantage .",
    "the scaled tortoise coordinate description casts the nsrwe into the standard klein - gordon equation form , whereas the use of the scaled circumferential radius simplifies the form of @xmath50 outside the star . in our formalism",
    ", we will apply these coordinates in different regions of interest .    in the following",
    "we seek a power series expansion for the qnm frequency @xmath99 of the perturbed star : @xmath100 we will find a general expression for @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) and explicitly determine the leading two expansion coefficients , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .      inside the star",
    "we adopt the scaled tortoise coordinate @xmath89 as the independent variable and consider the solution to ( [ kg_sc ] ) as a function of three independent variables @xmath89 , @xmath15 and @xmath84 , namely : @xmath105 this solution is specified by the regularity condition at the origin and holds for @xmath106 . outside the star ( @xmath107 ) , the scaled circumferential radius is used instead and we regard the solution to ( [ kg_sc ] ) there as a function of @xmath82 and @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , @xmath108 is a solution that satisfies the outgoing wave boundary condition at spatial infinity . outside the star ,",
    "nsrwe is identical to the regge - wheeler equation of black holes and therefore @xmath108 can be obtained from the leaver s series solution originally developed for determination of qnms of black holes @xcite .",
    "for each @xmath84 , we can evaluate the qnm frequency @xmath15 by matching the logarithmic derivatives of @xmath109 and @xmath110 at @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath112 where @xmath113 it is interesting to note that @xmath114 are matched at the scaled radius @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 ) that would vary with @xmath84 .      to generate an expansion for the qnm frequency @xmath99 , we firstly expand @xmath117 as a power series in the perturbation parameter @xmath84 : @xmath118 where @xmath119 and we have suppressed the dependence on @xmath88 in the expansion coefficients @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) . by transforming ( [ kg_sc ] ) into the form of the riccati equation : @xmath122 making use of the expansions ( [ vexp ] ) and ( [ fexp ] ) , and comparing equal powers of @xmath84 , we show that @xmath123 here @xmath124 and for @xmath125 , @xmath126,\\ ] ] and we have used the prime to symbolize differentiation with respect to @xmath89 .",

    "we aim to evaluate qnms of realistic stars from those of cba star with sclpt developed here . for a realistic star whose compactness @xmath43 and potential @xmath184",
    "are known , we compare it with a cba star with the same compactness @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the tortoise radius of the cba star . however , in this case the scaled circumferential radii of the two stars in consideration are the same . in other words , @xmath189 for @xmath190 .",
    "besides , it is convenient to take the formal expansion parameter @xmath191 in the current situation .",
    "as both @xmath192 and @xmath193 for @xmath194 , the matrix elements @xmath195 and @xmath196 can be simplified and respectively take the form : @xmath197 @xmath198\\tpsi^2_0(\\tx)\\d\\tx \\nonumber \\\\&&+\\tpsi^2_0(\\tr_{*0})\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\tr_{*1}^2}{2 } \\frac{\\d^2 f_0}{\\d\\tx^2}+ \\tr_{*1}\\frac{\\d f_1}{\\d\\tx}\\right)_{\\tx=\\tr_{*0 } } -\\frac{\\tomega_1 ^ 2}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2f_+ } { \\partial\\tomega^2}\\right)_{\\tr=\\tr_0}\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first and second order shifts in qnm frequency then follow directly from ( [ freq1 ] ) , ( [ freq2 ] ) and ( [ freq3 ] ) .    figure [ f4 ] shows qnms obtained from the perturbation scheme outlined above for stars constructed from various eoss with a common compactness @xmath199 . the unfilled , dark , and grey symbols respectively indicate the exact , the first and the second order results , while the star is the unperturbed frequency of cba .",
    "it is clearly shown that the second order perturbation results can nicely approximate the exact ones .",
    "we have also applied sclpt to stable neutron stars with a larger ( or smaller ) compactness and found that the second - order results are indeed reliable .",
    "in fact , the first order formula readily suffices to yield accurate prediction of the shift in @xmath200 .    on the other hand",
    ", we have to point out the limitations of sclpt . as in other cases ,",
    "perturbation theory is likely to break down in the presence of instabilities .",
    "therefore , we expect that the accuracy of perturbative results obtained from sclpt gets worse when the star becomes unstable against perturbation .",
    "we verify this point by applying sclpt to neutron stars constructed with gm24 eos @xcite , which are known to be unstable if the compactness is greater than @xmath201 .",
    "as clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , where qnms of cba and gm24 stars with @xmath202 are shown , the deviation of the second - order result from the exact value increases as the compactness approaches the border of stability .",
    "however , as far as @xmath200 is concerned , both the first and second order results are satisfactory .",
    "the main achievement in the present paper is the discovery that the universality in the qnm frequency of axial pulsations of neutron stars in fact originates from the cba , under which the potential term in the scaled nsrwe is essentially a centrifugal barrier .",
    "there are two parameters in the scaled potential , namely the scaled circumferential radius @xmath175 and tortoise radius @xmath63 of the star .",
    "while the former is just the inverse of the compactness @xmath43 , the latter can be determined from that of tviim .",
    "these two parameters completely determine the qnms of cba and in turn give rise to the observed universality .    in order to consider how the the physical characteristics of a neutron star could affect the frequencies of its qnms ,",
    "we have also developed a systematic perturbative scheme sclpt , which is designed to cope with the divergence in qnm wavefunction at spatial infinity .",
    "direct application of sclpt to cba then successfully predicts the universality in the qnm frequency of realistic neutron stars . the advantage of application of the scaled coordinates ( @xmath82 and @xmath89 ) in our study becomes manifest in this regard because the potential @xmath50 outside a star is independent of its detailed internal structure save its compactness , leading to the observed universality @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", sclpt can also predict small deviations in qnm frequencies from those of cba for individual realistic neutron stars .",
    "this opens possibilities for researchers to link the qnm frequencies observed from a distant star with its internal structure and eos as well .",
    "we are currently working on the inverse problem of sclpt , namely inferring the internal structure of a pulsating neutron star from its gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "relevant progress in this direction will be reported elsewhere in due course .",
    "so far we have used the least - damped @xmath6-mode to illustrate the principle and accuracy of our method .",
    "however , the results mentioned in the present paper are general and hold for modes of higher orders ( i.e. modes with frequencies higher than that of the least - damped one ) .",
    "more interestingly , we note that the @xmath203-mode ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) also displays similar universality . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , where the real and imaginary parts of the scaled qnm frequencies of the @xmath20-modes of various realistic stellar models , tviim and cba are plotted against the compactness , the universality summarized in ( [ tla ] ) is clearly exhibited .",
    "it is remarkable that the corresponding values obtained from application of second - order sclpt to cba ( the solid line ) successfully capture the essence of such universal behavior . to further examine the validity of cba and sclpt in this case ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] the scaled qnm frequency of a @xmath20-mode of a cba star ( the star symbol ) and other realistic stars ( the unfilled symbols ) with a common compactness @xmath204 , the first and second order results obtained from applying sclpt to the cba star ( respectively denoted by the corresponding dark and grey symbols ) .",
    "it is obvious that sclpt can indeed reproduce accurate eigenfrequencies for the @xmath20-mode .    despite that we have demonstrated here the validity of cba and sclpt for ordinary @xmath6-modes and @xmath20 modes ; we have to caution that the trapped mode is an exception to our method .",
    "as is well known , trapped modes usually exist in ultra - compact stars with compactness greater than 1/3 and have small decaying rates @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of such modes is the development of a local minimum in the potential @xmath66 inside the star when @xmath205 .",
    "hence , gravitational waves are trapped in the potential minimum and acquire much longer lifetime .",
    "the analysis proposed in the present paper relies on the validity of the cba model whose potential term @xmath66 is obviously a monotonic function inside the star .",
    "in fact , the cba potential deviates significantly from those of tviim ( or other ultra - compact stars ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] , trapped modes of cba are no longer good approximation to those of tviim if @xmath205 and therefore it is not possible to obtain the trapped modes of tviim ( or other ultra - compact stars ) from application of sclpt to cba .",
