    "strongly correlated electron systems , 2005 ( sces05 ) was held in vienna .",
    "this classical city , with its legendary coffee houses ( many just outside the conference venue ) , proved a superb setting to review and discuss the latest discoveries in this active area of materials and condensed matter physics research .",
    "sces05 is a direct descendant of the first international conference on valence fluctuations , held in rochester new york in 1977@xcite .",
    "the consistency with which the discovery of new materials and new concepts has outstripped expectations is simply extraordinary . in 1977 ,",
    "the concept that localized f - electrons could form heavy bands was treated with considerable skepticism and the possibility of electronically mediated superconductivity in dense local moment systems was regarded as highly radical !",
    "our meeting in vienna celebrated 30 years since these seminal discoveries , yet it was also a forward looking conference , with a host of incredible new discoveries .",
    "i came away from the meeting feeling like a kid , with a huge sense of excitement about the prospects for the future .",
    "strongly correlated electron physics is a field never far from applications , and strong links between research and the development of rare earth magnets , thermo - cooling , cryogenics , multiferroics and applied superconductivity continue today .",
    "we often forget however the equally important role of this field of physics as frontier science in the `` middle ground '' of our quantum universe .",
    "the domain of experiments reported at this conference spans a temperature range from room temperature to millikelvin , and within this playground , we have the opportunity to explore the general principles that govern collective behavior in matter , often using discoveries made on one scale , to understand the physics on another .",
    "for example , discoveries made in actinide and rare earth `` heavy electron physics '' have had broad influence on our understanding of magnetism and high temperature superconductivity in more complex oxide materials , yet they have also influenced research into quantum dots and mesoscopics .",
    "but the discoveries and ideas of strongly correlated electron physics also enjoy an influence that stretches far further along the energy axis , on one side out to the physics of the early universe , neutron stars , quark gluon plasmas and anisotropic color superconductivity , and on the other side , down to the low energy physics of helium-3 and the tiny energy scales of atom traps ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ) . today , experimental discovery and theoretical ideas developed through strongly correlated electron systems continue to enjoy a strong mutual influence with these kindred fields of research .    0.2 cm     to @xmath0 , ideas and research on strongly correlated electron systems in the lab have a broad connection with physics on far lower , and far greater energy scales . ,",
    "one of the themes of this field , is the quest to discover new quantum phases of matter and realize them in practical materials . along the way , we need to learn the guiding principles that help us to navigate amongst the vast space of the periodic table .",

    "kim , harrison et al.@xcite report on a plethora of new phases that develop in @xmath1 upon application of high magnetic fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . ) .",
    "they have discovered that the high field specific heat of this material ( doped with rhodium to suppress some of the order around the critical point ) closely resembles that observed near a metamagnetic phase transition in @xmath6 .",
    "metamagnetism involves a sudden cross - over magnetization from unpolarized to fully polarized fermi liquid .",
    "studies of the quasi two dimensional material @xmath7 suggest that metamagnetism takes place in materials that lie close to the critical end - point of a line of first order `` ferromagnetic '' phase transitions@xcite . a new analysis of harrison et al .",
    "provides further support for the idea that quantum critical end points can act as nucleating point for new quantum phases .",
    "i was also excited by new progress towards identifying the the `` hidden order '' ( ho ) that develops in this @xmath1 below 17k@xcite .",
    "it is this order which is persists up to the high fields where nexus of new phases begin .",
    "three new pieces of insight about the ho were announced at vienna .",
    "it is now increasingly clear that the ho state is distinct from a large moment antiferromagnetic phase that phase - coexists with the hidden order under pressure . at this meeting ,",
    "sato et al@xcite showed measurements of the susceptibility under pressure which indicate that heavy fermion superconductivity is unique to the hidden order phase , and does not develop in the large moment antiferromagnet .",

    "the absence of parity conservation implies that both singlet and triplet pairs coherently coexist .",
    "experimental and theoretical work on this material has progressed at an impressive rate in the two years since its discovery .",
    "mamoru yogi presented new nmr data@xcite which provides a striking confirmation of this co - existence of triplet and singlet pairs , exhibiting a small coherence peak characteristic of s - wave superconductivity , slowly crossing over to a @xmath17 dependence at low temperatures that is characteristic of line nodes around the fermi surface ( fig .",

    "the inclusion of this `` kondo physics '' into heavy electron superconductivity is a largely unexplored theoretical challenge .",
    "one of the paradoxes that needs to be explored concerns the strong coulomb repulsion between the f - electrons which we expect to severely suppress the s - wave pairing component of the f - electrons , so that @xmath21 in a kondo lattice , this suppression is total , because of the local @xmath22 gauge symmetry associated with the f - spins@xcite . from this perspective , it is difficult to understand how the pair - condensation entropy can be associated with s - wave pairing and f - electrons at the same time , and this is an interesting paradox to motivate future work .",

    "the same group has now succeeded in adding more @xmath28 atoms to form a bilayer quantum fluid .",
    "the new bilayer system remains a fermi liquid up to a much higher critical coverage around @xmath29 , where it undergoes a quantum phase transition into a magnetic state .",
    "saunders notes that bilayer @xmath3 may closely resemble a two - dimensional heavy fermion system , in which the lower layer of atoms is an almost localized spin system and the upper layer behaves as a conduction band.zero point `` valence fluctuations '' between the layers may play an important role , causing spin exchange between the upper and lower fluid that closely resembles the physics of a two dimensional kondo lattice ( [ fig4 ] .",
    "the observed specific heat curves show a maximum @xmath24 and appears to indicate the presence of an as - yet unexplained gap @xmath30 in the excitation spectrum . as the filling of the second layer is increased , the inverse mass of the fermi liquid appears to collapse linearly to zero as the critical coverage is approached , while @xmath24 vanishes with a power law .",

    "this is an exciting new discovery that should be a great encouragement to the field , prompting new theoretical work and tending to support the idea that the physics of quantum criticality seen in electronic heavy fermion systems may in fact , be universal to a much broader class of fermionic matter .",
    "one of the dreams of numerical approaches , is to develop tools that on the one hand , can provide us with new insights into simple models but on the other hand , can guide us in the discovery of materials with new quantum properties .",
    "there is a strong tradition of creative numerical algorithms in the field of strongly correlated electrons , one that stretches back to ken wilson s pioneering numerical renormalization group solution to the kondo model@xcite .",
    "this tradition continues today .    a modern descendant of wilson s numerical renormalization group approach is the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite . for one - dimensional models ,",
    "this has become a state - of - the - art tool .",
    "an example of beautiful work in this direction , is provided by the dmrg study of the quarter filled , one dimensional kondo lattice , by hotta and shibata @xcite .",
    "earlier dmrg work on this topic had proposed that at a quarter filling , the kondo lattice becomes unstable to an insulating state , with with long - range staggered dimer order @xmath32 hotta and shimuzu have carefully studied the size dependence of dimer correlations using dmrg , triangulating their results by comparing even and odd - numbered chains .",
    "they conclude that the dimer order has power - law correlations , but no long range order .",
    "this work illustrates how , despite great advances , very careful scaling studies continue to be absolutely vital before drawing hard and fast conclusions about the thermodynamic limit .",
    "continued progress is also being made in the application of direct diagonalization approaches .",
    "one of the unsolved pieces of physics that challenges the theoretical community is the doniach quantum phase transition that is believed to separate local moment magnetism , and heavy electron paramagnetism in the metallic kondo lattice@xcite .",
    "zerec et al presented a finite temperature `` lanczos '' diagonalization study of the two dimensional kondo lattice@xcite , in which the temperature dependence of the specific heat shows a two - peak structure that may signal the approach to the magnetic quantum critical point .",
    "i have the sense that these approaches will be amongst the first to provide us with the first detailed phase diagram of the two dimensional kondo lattice .",
    "one area of immense interest , is the application of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) to strongly correlated systems .",
    "dynamical mean field theory@xcite regards strongly correlated electron systems as an effective impurity , or cluster of atoms , embedded in a self - consistently determined environment .",
    "this approach is in many ways , the 21st century descendant of density - functional theory , but now , the free energy is now a functional of the local , or cluster approximated green s functions .",
    "the challenge becomes to efficiently compute the functional of the local or cluster green s functions .",
    "many interesting papers were presented which marry the dynamical mean field theory with local , or cluster `` solvers '' provided by a variety of other methods .",
    "for example , koller and hewson@xcite showed how the combination of dmft , with the use of numerical renormalization group to provide the impurity solver , could provide new insight into strong polaronic renormalization of electron masses in a holstein - hubbard model .    in an innovative piece of work ,",
    "hanke , aichorn , dahnken , arrigoni and potthoff@xcite demonstrated how they can extract the functional dependence of the free energy on cluster greens functions from a monte carlo study of clusters .",
    "the function is then used to compute the translationally invariant lattice green s functions .",
    "dieter vollhardt@xcite showed how the older density functional theory can be combined with the dmft , and illustrated the tremendous potential of these hybrid methods for the study of metal - insulator transitions in vanadium oxide systems , notably @xmath33 .",
    "vollhardt showed how these methods were able to track both the incoherent local background , and the dispersive component of the electron spectral functions , which contained `` kinks '' in the dispersion , corresponding to mass - renormalization effects .",
    "frontier research of this sort is , i believe , slowly providing the framework for ab - initio many body studies of the future .",
    "a vital middle ground for research in our field , is the development of new , phenomenological approaches .",
    "condensed matter physics is driven largely by experimental discovery .",
    "phenomenology is not only a stepping stone to deeper theoretical insight , it is also the key to a closer interplay between theory and experiment .    two interesting pieces of phenomenology caught my eye at sces05 .",
    "achim rosch@xcite discussed `` gr \" uneisen '' parameter @xmath34 can be used to characterize pressure or field - tuned quantum phase transitions .",
    "the gr \" uneisen parameter is the ratio of the thermal expansivity @xmath35 to the specific , heat @xmath36 @xmath37 near a quantum critical point , the characteristic scale of the fermi liquid @xmath38 . collapses to zero as power of the separation @xmath39 from the critical point .",
    "simple scaling analyses show that the collapse of this scale to zero leads to a a divergence of the temperature dependent gr \" uneisen parameter at a quantum critical point , given by @xmath40@xcite .",
    "rosch showed how degree of divergence of the gruneissen parameter is an important method to delineate between `` local '' and `` spin density wave '' magnetic quantum critical points .",
    "moreover , the gr \" uneissen parameter should should change sign at a quantum critical point , making it an extremely useful tool for hunting for quantum phase transitions .",
    "one of the most useful unifying trends in strongly correlated electron systems is the kadowaki woods relation@xcite @xmath41 between the quadratic `` @xmath42 '' coefficient of the resistivity ( @xmath43 ) and the specific heat coefficient @xmath44 .",
    "the constancy of this quantity over a wide range of strongly correlated materials is a reflection of the local character of the quasi - particle interactions .",
    "tsujii et al .",
    "@xcite have made the observation that several @xmath45 compounds with a large orbital degeneracy , develop a consistently lower kadowaki woods ratio . in a lovely piece of phenomenology , in which they analyze the dependence of the fermi liquid properties on spin degeneracy @xmath46 , tsujii",
    "et al find that both @xmath42 and @xmath47 scale as @xmath48@xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath24 is the characteristic scale of the fermi liquid , so that the kadowaki woods relation becomes @xmath50 this degeneracy dependence accounts for the low kw ratio in @xmath45 compounds , and when taken into account , brings them into line into align with the broad majority of lower spin degeneracy materials .",
    "there were so many fascinating discoveries i encountered in the meeting that seem prime fodder for future phenomenological work . here",
    "are three phenomena that may fall into this category :    * gegenwart pointed out a fascinating property of the fermi liquid ground - state of @xmath51 , as it is field tuned towards the quantum critical point@xcite .",
    "although the specific heat coefficient @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the quadratic coefficient of the resistivity all diverge , it is the modified kadowaki woods ratio @xmath54 rather than @xmath55 that remains constant . what simple model for the momentum - dependent interactions in a fermi liquid model can account for this scaling ?",

    "* in the heavy electron superconductor @xmath19 , a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinikov ( fflo ) phase , ( in which the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated ) is observed at low temperatures , near the pauli - limited upper critical field@xcite . as the field is rotated away from the c - axis , a sequential heirachy of fflo phases develop@xcite , manifested by a sequence of plateau s in the magnetization .",
    "this physics does not fit into the existing understanding of fflo phases , and it may involve the stabilization of vortex structures through the development of antiferromagnetism in the vortex cores . traditionally , fflo phases are treated using non - uniform solutions of the boguilubov de gennes equation@xcite , but the interplay with magnetism makes such an approach far too complicated for these systems .",
    "would it be possible , i wonder , to develop a landau ginzburg theory for fflo phases that can take antiferromagnetic vortex cores into account ?",

    "strontium titanate may offer the possibility of a text - book quantum phase transition , because there are no complicating effects of electron damping in insulators . in this system",
    ", the temporal quantum fluctuations of the electric polarization should count as one additional dimension , so the quantum critical behavior in strontium titanate should be equivalent to an ising phase transition in four - dimensions .",

    ", we still do not have a theory for how zero - point spin fluctuations melt antiferromagnetic order in a metal .",
    "indeed , our understanding of such quantum phase transitions is far better evolved for insulating antiferromagnetic order , than it is for metallic antiferromagnets . at this meeting ,",

    "si , ingersent , smith and rabello@xcite have proposed that the bad - actor heavy electron quantum critical points are quasi - two dimensional spin fluids in which the important critical spin fluctuations are critically correlated in time .",
    "local quantum criticality is certainly the most mature theory of heavy electron quantum criticality that we have at the current time .",
    "many other ideas have also been advanced as contenders .",
    "one of the ideas floating around the community , is that the composite electrons which form the heavy electron fluid may break into spinons and holons at the quantum critical point .",
    "this has been an idea explored by catherine pepin in her recent work@xcite .",
    "the idea of deconfined spinons also features in the ideas of `` deconfined criticality '' advanced by senthil et al.@xcite .",
    "none of these approaches is yet able to provide a clear idea of how to connect the a state of three dimensional magnetic order to the three - dimensional heavy electron paramagnet .",
    "my own belief is that progress on quantum criticality may benefit by partially refocusing our effort towards developing a mean - field theory to connect local moment magnetism with the heavy fermion metal .",
    "just as landau and weiss mean theory of ferromagnetism provided the key insights into the soft modes of classical criticality , i suspect that a proper mean - field theory linking the kondo lattice to local moment magnetism will provide key insight into the unusual zero modes responsible for the quasi - linear resistivity @xmath66 and the unusual logarithmic temperature dependence of the specific heat coefficient @xmath67 seen in heavy electron criticality@xcite .",
    "the discovery of heavy fermion behavior in bilayer @xmath3 announced at this conference@xcite provides tremendous new impetus to theoretical studies of heavy fermion criticality .",
    "here we have an absolutely two dimensional heavy fermion system to which we may compare our theories .",
    "bilayer @xmath3 , is in essence , a localized layer of heisenberg spins , coupled vertically via a kondo coupling to an upper layer of mobile fermions .",
    "one of the challenges this poses , is to connect the phase diagram of the two dimensional quantum antiferromagnet , with the two dimensional kondo lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] )        there are two ways for zero point quantum fluctuations to melt the magnetic order in a quantum antiferromagnet :    * by increasing the zero - point fluctuations of the spin ( by reducing the size @xmath68 of the spin or increasing the magnetic frustration ) , or * by coupling the spin fluid via a kondo coupling to a two - dimensional fluid of fermions .",
    "these two processes define two orthogonal axes of a phase diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . along the `` frustration ( x- ) axis '' that loosely defines insulating antiferromagnets",
    ", there is a quantum phase transition from a spin liquid to an ordered two dimensional antiferromagnet",
    ". this quantum phase transition has been extensively studied , and is the source of inspiration for `` deconfined quantum criticality '' advanced by senthil et al .",
    "as a theory for critical behavior which is dominated by the formation of a fluid of deconfined spinons@xcite . along the kondo ( y- ) axis , there is the quantum phase transition from antiferromagnet to heavy electron fermi liquid .",
    "a working mean - field theory would show us how these two phase transitions are connected .",
    "for highly frustrated , low spin lattices , we will also have to understand how a gapped spin liquid can make a transition to the heavy fermi liquid , and whether , as seems the case in both @xmath69@xcite and @xmath70@xcite , there is an intermediate non - fermi liquid ground - state separating the antiferromagnet from the fully developed fermi liquid .",
    "there are some interesting technical practical problems to be solved to actually realize this phase diagram in a controlled calculation .",
    "one important aspect to the problem , is finding a way to control the fluctuations to form a mean - field theory .",
    "in classical criticality , this kind of control was obtained by generalizing the three component magnetization to an @xmath46 component order parameter , the so called `` spherical model '' , where the @xmath71 rotation group is replaced by the @xmath72 rotation group@xcite . in heavy fermion physics , we have yet to find the appropriate large @xmath46 expansion to described the phases on both sides of the quantum critical point . for a long time",
    ", our field has followed the example of the particle physics , in trying to use the @xmath73 group for this purpose .",
    "the problem with @xmath73 group , is that singlets are baryons , and they require complexes of @xmath46 particles , @xmath74 but in condensed matter physics , the formation of singlets between pairs of particles - electrons in superconductors , spins in antiferromagnets , plays a very important role .",
    "an important group for our purposes , may well be the group @xmath75 , which preserves the special relationship between up and down electrons@xcite . in sp ( 2n ) ,",
    "the spin labels on the states are given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 runs from @xmath79 to @xmath46 , and a pair operator still defines a singlet @xmath80 one of the nice properties of this group , is that it preserves a local @xmath22 particle - hole gauge symmetry@xcite , yet surprisingly , this symmetry has has not yet been applied to the kondo impurity , or kondo lattice problems .",
    "another important technical problem , is how to tune @xmath68 , as one does in insulating antiferromagnets , while maintaining a perfectly screened kondo lattice .",
    "this part of the problem was fortunately solved some years ago by parcollet and georges , who pointed out that that one could consider a family of kondo lattice models of different spin @xmath68 , in which each spin is coupled to @xmath81 screening channels@xcite .",
    "the `` mean - field theory '' that appears in this kind of eliashberg or dynamical mean field theory .",
    "recent results of jerome rech at rutgers , and my collaborators gergely zarand and olivier parcollet indicate @xcite that it may be possible to exactly compute the mean - field phase diagram in the large @xmath46 limit using this scheme , using schwinger bosons .",
    "schwinger bosons are an effective method to describe low dimensional antiferromagnetism , and our most recent work confirms that they can also describe the fully screened fermi liquid physics of the one and two impurity kondo model .",
    "one of the exciting aspects of this kind of approach , is that the initial mathematical formulation involves a gauge theory of electrons interacting with spinons , which carry the local moment spin , and charged spinless fermions , or `` holons '' which mediate the kondo interaction .",
    "remarkably , when one solves the equations for the fully screened kondo model , one finds that spinon and holons develop a gap in the fermi liquid .",
    "antiferromagnetism corresponds to the condensation of spinons , and when this happens , the gap for both holons and spinons must collapse suggesting a kind of critical behavior featuring a co - existence of critical spin and charge fluctuations ( see fig.[fig7 ] . ) .",
    "taken seriously , this appears to predict that a heavy electron fermi liquid near to a quantum critical point may have new , low lying spinon and holon excitations .",
    "we hope to report on these results in future meetings .",
    "i came to my first conference as a new ph.d .",
    ", twenty one years ago , in cologne 1984 , just as the ideas of heavy electron bands , and heavy electron superconductivity were becoming accepted phenomena .",
    "i was excited , had the sense that realistically , we d probably had our fair quota of big discoveries .",
    "had anyone tried to convince me that d - wave superconductivity at @xmath82 superconductivity , quantum dots , routine experiments at @xmath83 in things called atom traps , and a completely new class of phase transition , would be part of the near future , i would certainly have dismissed it as wonderful science fiction ! yet all of this happened in the past twenty years .",
    "so perhaps you today - as a student are wondering , if now , finally , the big discoveries are past ?",
    "absolutely not ! today , the reasons for optimism about research in strongly correlated electrons are at least as bright as twenty years ago , and if the past is any lesson for the future , major discoveries - both experimental and theoretical , will come that will continue to outstrip our expectation .",
    "i think think as experimentalists and theorists , especially the students in the audience - we can not be too ambitious with our research at this time .",
    "it is still an exciting time , and i wish you good spirits and good luck as you return to your home institutions .",
    "this research was supported by the national science foundation , usa , grant dmr-0312495 .",
    "i am indebted to john saunders , for discussions about his bilayer @xmath3 data , and to neil harrison and jaime moreno for providing figure 2 . at very short notice .",
    "thanks to stephen julian for drawing the possible non - fermi liquid phase of @xmath70 to my attention .",
