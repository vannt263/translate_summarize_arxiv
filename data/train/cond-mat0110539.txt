    "the formation , resonant or phonon - assisted , of qw excitons and their following relaxation towards a final ( quasi- ) equilibrium thermodynamic state at low lattice temperature @xmath2 are the subject of numerous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies .",

    "thermalization of hot photoexcited excitons down to the temperature of the cold lattice occurs mainly via scattering by thermal bulk longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons and is much more efficient for quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) systems as compared to bulk semiconductors .",
    "this follows from the relaxation of momentum conservation in the @xmath13-direction ( the qw growth direction ) for quasi-2d systems : the ground - state mode @xmath14 , i.e. , the energy state @xmath15 , couples to the continuum energy states @xmath16 , rather than to the single energy state @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the longitudinal sound velocity and @xmath19 is the in - plane translational mass of excitons ) as occurs in bulk materials . as a result , the la - phonon assisted kinetics of qw excitons becomes dominant at @xmath20 @xmath10 : in this case exciton - exciton scattering can be neglected while bose - einstein ( be ) statistics already strongly influences the relaxation process at low temperatures .",

    "<S> acoustic - phonon - assisted thermalization kinetics of excitons in quantum wells ( qws ) is developed for small concentrations of particles , @xmath0 @xmath1 , when particle - particle interaction can be neglected while bose - einstein statistics already strongly influences the relaxation processes at low temperatures . in this case </S>",
    "<S> thermalization of qw excitons occurs through nonequilibrium states and is given by the following scenario . during the first transient stage , which lasts a few characteristic scattering times , </S>",
    "<S> the correlations with an initial distribution of qw excitons disappear . </S>",
    "<S> the next , adiabatic stage of thermalization usually takes many characteristic scattering times , depends only upon two control parameters , the lattice temperature @xmath2 and the degeneracy temperature @xmath3 , and is characterized by a quasi - equilibrated distribution of high - energy qw excitons with effective temperature @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the thermalization law of high - energy particles is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a marginal value of the continuous eigenvalue spectrum of the linearized kinetics . by analyzing the linearized phonon - assisted kinetics of statistically - degenerate qw excitons , we study the dependence @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical estimates refer to high quality gaas and znse qws . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose a special design of gaas - based microcavities , which considerably weakens the bottleneck effect in relaxation of excitons ( polaritons ) and allows us to optimize the acoustic - phonon - assisted thermalization processes . </S>"
