    "rotation - powered ( `` recycled '' ) millisecond pulsars ( msps ) were discovered at x - ray energies during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey @xcite . in its lifetime , _ rosat _ detected x - ray emission from 10 msps in the field of the galaxy and one in the globular cluster m28 @xcite .",
    "these observations established that msps are very faint x - ray sources with typical x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 . in recent years , the superb sensitivity of the _ _ chandra _ _ and _ _ xmm - newton _ _ x - ray observatories have permitted much more detailed studies of these objects . _",
    "chandra _ , in particular , with its unprecedented sub - arcsecond angular resolution , has proven to be ideally suited for studies of globular clusters , where msps are found in great abundance .",
    "in addition , both facilities have allowed detailed spectroscopic and timing studies of the nearby msps in the field of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "herein , we summarize the current state of affairs and examine future prospects in the x - ray study of msps .",
    "radio timing surveys have revealed that globular clusters are veritable treasure troves of msps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as such , they allow a very efficient way to study msps at x - ray energies due to their inherent faintness of these objects , which necessitates very long exposures .",
    "this is best examplified by the detection of x - ray counterparts to all 19 msps with known radio timing positions ( fig .",
    "1 ) in a deep _ chandra _ acis - s exposure of 47 tuc .",
    "the large majority of the 47 tuc msps ( 16 out of 19 ) appear to be soft , thermal x - ray sources with temperatures @xmath2 k , emission radii @xmath3 km , and luminosities @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the inferred effective emission areas imply that this radiation originates from the heated magnetic polar caps of the pulsar , as suggested by theoretical pulsar models @xcite .",
    "the thermal nature of the observed x - ray emission was subsequently confirmed with _",
    "hrc - s timing observations , which revealed relatively broad pulsations with relatively low ( @xmath450% ) pulsed fractions @xcite .",
    "for several msps , there is indication of an additional thermal component ( implying non - uniform heating of the polar cap ) , similar to what is seen in several nearby field msps @xcite .",
    "these similarities in x - ray properties imply that , in general , no systematic differences exist between msps in globular clusters and those in the field of the galaxy .",
    "it has been speculated that globular cluster msps should differ from those in the field of the galaxy due to repeated dynamical binary exchanges and accretion episodes , which may alter the magnetic field topology of the pulsar from a dipolar to a multipolar one @xcite .",
    "however , the x - ray data indicates that even if most globular cluster msps do undergo `` re - recycling '' , this does not significantly alter the observable properties of these objects .",
    "m@xmath5 , @xmath6 km ns with two point - like antipodal hot spots @xcite .",
    "the panels show pulse profiles for ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , and ( @xmath13 , @xmath12 ) , from top to bottom , respectively . the solid lines in each plot correspond to a h atmosphere ( _ black _ ) and blackbody emission ( _ green _ ) with no doppler effect included .",
    "the dashed lines show the effect of doppler boosting and aberration for @xmath14 ms .",
    "all fluxes are normalized to the value for @xmath15 . ]",
    "it has been shown that modeling x - ray spectroscopic and timing data of thermal msps can be used to extract important information regarding the properties of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "given that the vast majority of msps appear to be thermal x - ray sources , it is important to develop realistic theoretical models to ascertain whether this method can be employed to gain useful insight into the properties of msps .",
    "such models of surface emission from msps need to incorporate general relativistic effects of gravitational redshift and bending of photon trajectories as well as special relativistic effects ( doppler boosting and aberration ) due to the rapid motion of the stellar surface .",
    "it is also necessary to consider an optically - thick , weakly magnetized light - element atmosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such an atmospheric layer is expected at the surface of a msp given the standard formation scenaro of msps , involving accretion of a substantial amount of gas @xcite .",
    "the synthetic pulse profiles of msps generated using these models are characterized by broad pulsations and moderate pulsed fractions , which are significantly larger than those of a blackbody emission spectrum for the same assumed parameters ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . most notably , unlike the beamed radio emission , the duty cycle of the x - ray radiation is always 100% and is observable for all combinations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these characteristics have important implications for population studies of msps ( see below ) .",
    "km and @xmath18 m@xmath19 .",
    "the dashed line shows the expected antipodal position of the secondary polar cap.,title=\"fig : \" ]   km and @xmath18 m@xmath19 .",
    "the dashed line shows the expected antipodal position of the secondary polar cap.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a hydrogen atmosphere polar cap x - ray emission model has been found to be in fair agreement with the available x - ray data of the three nearest known msps , psrs j04374715 @xcite , j21243358 , and j0030 + 0451 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a blackbody emission model is inconsistent the observed pulse profiles .",
    "this provides compelling evidence that a gaseous atmosphere is indeed present at the surface of these neutron stars . for psrs j04374715 and",
    "j21243358 , the data indicates that the two polar caps are not diametrically opposite on the stellar surface , implying an off - center dipole magnetic axis .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the thermal x - ray pulsations offers interesting constraints on the mass - to - radius ratio ( @xmath20 ) of the neutron star .",
    "in particular , for j04374715 , j21243358 , and j0030 + 0451 we find @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 km , respectively ( 68% confidence ) , assuming @xmath18 m@xmath19 .",
    "modeling of the thermal x - ray pulse profiles from msps also gives useful limits on the magnetic field geometry of the pulsar , which in turn provides stringest observational constraints on theoretical pulsar models .",
    "for example , ruderman has postulated the presence of crustal `` plates '' on the ns surface formed by shear stresses on the crust caused by neutron superfluid vortex lines pinned to lattice nuclei .",
    "the motion of these plates would cause the magnetic fields of msps to migrate across the stellar surface , resulting in either an aligned magnetic field or one pinched at one of the spin poles .",
    "however , the observed thermal pulse shapes and pulsed fractions from the nearest msps ( @xmath243050% ) suggest that the magnetic field resembles a ( nearly ) centered dipole and is moderately inclined with respect to the spin axis ( see fig .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the dipole fields of these ( and likely all ) msps do not have a tendency to migrate towards the spin pole or align with the spin axis .",
    "moreover , the infered x - ray  emitting areas are consistent with the classical polar cap area [ @xmath25 km ] and do not favor so - called `` squeezed '' polar caps @xcite .",
    "h ) . note the remarkable absence of hard x - ray photons between phases 0.4 and 0.7 , which can be explained by a geometric occultation of the intrabinary shock by the unusual main - sequence secondary star ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . ]",
    "a number of radio eclipsing binary msps , such as the canonical `` black widow '' pulsar b1957 + 20 @xcite , 47 tuc j and o @xcite , and m71a @xcite , exhibit unresolved hard non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "this is likely synchrotron radiation from a shock formed by the action of the pulsar wind on the companion star @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies ( complemented by optical observations ) of these systems offer a useful diagnostic of the properties of msp winds .",
    "the eclipsing binary msps psr j17405340 in the globular cluster ngc 6397 @xcite and psr j00247204w in 47 tuc @xcite exhibit very peculiar radio , optical , and x - ray properties that set them apart from other msps ( see fig .",
    "the unusual behavior of these systems most probably stems from the fact that they are bound to unevolved ( main - sequence  like ) companions .",
    "this is at odds with the standard formation scenario of msps , which requires the companion to evolve off the main sequence in order for accretion and spin - up to commence @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the current binary partners were not the stars that spun up the msps . as the dense environment of a globular cluster core is conducive to close dynamical encounters between stars , it is very likely that the present companion was acquired in a close binary - binary exchange encounter .",
    "these `` exchanged '' binaries offer a unique opportunity to study nss transitioning from accretion to rotation power .",
    "in particular , the observed x - ray and optical properties of the radio msp psr j00247204w are remarkably similar to those of the low - mass x - ray binary and x - ray millisecond pulsar sax j1808.43658 in quiescence .",
    "this supports the conjecture that the non - thermal x - ray emission and optical modulations seen in the sax j1808.43658 system in a quiescent state are due to interaction between the wind from a reactivated rotation - powered pulsar and matter from the companion star .",
    "the striking similarities between the two systems provide further support for the long - sought connection between millisecond radio pulsars and accreting neutron star systems .",
    "a very small subset of msps show remarkably sharp x - ray pulsations , indicative of non - thermal magnetospheric emission processes .",
    "these msp include the exceptionally energetic psrs b1937 + 21 @xcite , b182124 @xcite , and j0218 + 4232 ( @xmath26 ergs s@xmath1 , @xmath27 g ) @xcite as well as the mildly recycled relativistic binary msp psr j07373039a @xcite .",
    "this striking difference in x - ray spectral properties compared to most other msps implies a substantially different physical regime in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "models of pulsars suggest that the combination of spin properties of these four pulsars place them near the locus of theoretical curvature radiation ( cr ) pair - production death lines @xcite on the @xmath28 diagram .",
    "therefore , in these of pulsars , pair - production in the magnetosphere probably occurs via curvature radiation emitted by accelerating electrons . on the other hand , most msps ( such as those in 47 tuc ) ,",
    "lie well below the theoretical cr pair production death lines . in these objects , inverse compton scattering ( ics ) is the primary e@xmath29 production mechanism and the conditions in the magnetosphere favor substantial heating of the polar caps by a return flow of e@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "due to the inherent faintness of msps , at present , only a handful of nearby objects can be studied in great detail @xcite .",
    "the next generation of x - ray facilities , _ constellation - x _ and _ xeus _ , are expected to have @xmath24100 times greater sensitivity than which would enable studies of a much greater sample of msps .",
    "more importantly , these telescopes could be employed in blind timing searches for nearby ( @xmath312 kpc ) msps that are not observable at radio frequencies due to unfavorable viewing geometry .",
    "this is possible because the effect of light bending combined with the ( nearly ) antipodal configuration of the two msp hot spots ensure that the thermal radiation is seen by all distant observers for any combination of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , at radio frequencies a pulsar is not observable if @xmath32 exceeds the opening half - angle @xmath33 of the radio emission cone .",
    "figure 5 shows the x - ray pulsed fraction of a 10 km , 1.4 m@xmath19 msp as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "also shown are lines delineating the region of the @xmath34 plane for which a pulsar with a given radio emission cone width is observable at radio frequencies . if we assume a uniform distribution of pulsar obliquities ( @xmath16 ) and viewing angles ( @xmath17 ) , for @xmath35 a substantial portion ( @xmath2445% ) of the msp population is invisible to us in the radio .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider an x - ray timing survey with a limiting pulsed fraction sensitivity of @xmath2410% , only @xmath24515% ( depending on the mass and radius of the star ) of the msps will go undetected as pulsed sources though they will still be detected as x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the galactic population of msps may in fact be preferentially clustered in a certain range of @xmath16 due to the poorly understood effects of the accretion and magnetic field reduction processes during the lmxb phase on the ns .",
    "a deep x - ray timing survey of nearby ( @xmath311 - 2 kpc ) msps may , in principle , reveal whether this is indeed the case",
    ".     plane for msps .",
    "the solid lines represent contours of constant thermal x - ray pulsed fraction for @xmath6 km and @xmath18 m@xmath19 .",
    "the dot - dashed , dashed , and dotted lines show 10@xmath36 , 30@xmath36 , and 60@xmath36 , respectively , opening half - angles of the radio emission cone . ]",
    "to date , nearly 40 msps have been detected at x - ray energies , 19 of which are found in the globular cluster 47 tuc @xcite . it has become apparent that x - ray spectroscopic and timing observations of msps represent a very promising approach towards elucidating important pulsar properties that are not measurable by other observational means such as radio timing observations .",
    "further study of these sources will provide more important information regarding the x - ray properties of the galactic population of msps , as well as valuable insight into the fundamental properties of nss .",
    "we would like to thank g. rybicki , c. heinke , m. van den berg , f. camilo , p. freire , a. harding , and w. becker for their valuable contribution to the work described herein .",
