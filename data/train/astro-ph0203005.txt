    "it is widely accepted that many bright galaxies possess low - level nuclear activity .",
    "the palomar optical spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies by ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1995 , 1997a , 1997b ) showed that more than 40% of the 486 galaxies with @xmath8 mag and @xmath9 have optical spectra classified as seyfert nuclei , low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; heckman 1980 ) , or transition objects ( spectra intermediate between liners and nuclei ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , what fraction of these objects are genuine active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which we take to be objects powered by nonstellar processes .",
    "extensive observations have been made in various wavelengths to clarify the nature of these classes of objects ( for reviews see ho 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "x - ray observations play a key role in this regard .",
    "this paper presents the first systematic analysis of a large sample of liners and low - luminosity seyfert galaxies observed with the _ asca _ satellite .",
    "the gross spectroscopic characteristics of liners can be explained by a variety of ionization mechanisms , including traditional photoionization by a low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) , photoionization by a population of unusually hot stars , and mechanical heating by shock waves .",
    "recent reviews on this topic have been given by filippenko ( 1996 ) and barth ( 2002 ) .",
    "if liners are low - luminosity versions of agns , which are powered by accretion onto massive black holes , we expect them to emit nonthermal , hard x - rays . on the other hand , x",
    "- rays from thermal plasmas are expected from shock - heated gas .",
    "hot stars also have soft thermal spectra in the x - ray band .",
    "thus , x - ray observations can help discriminate between the various models for liners .",
    "we note , however , that hard x - rays ( hereinafter defined as @xmath10 kev ) are not a signature unique to agns : potential contributors to the hard - energy band include x - ray binaries , supernovae , and hot ( @xmath11 kev ) gas produced by starburst activity . an unambiguous search for agns using x - ray data",
    "thus requires careful consideration of the spectral , structural , and variability properties of the sources .",
    "many seyfert galaxies have been identified in the palomar survey .",
    "the median h@xmath12 luminosity of these sources is @xmath13 @xmath14 ergs s@xmath1 , which is more than 23 orders of magnitude lower than in classical seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , dahari & de  robertis 1988 ; whittle 1992 ) .",
    "x - ray observations of such low - luminosity seyferts ( hereinafter llseyferts ) are necessary to determine whether they are genuine agns and whether they are similar to luminous agns .",
    "in addition to studying the origin of activity in liners and llseyferts , the x - ray properties of these sources themselves hold great interest . by defining an llagn sample using strong agn candidates based on detailed study of individual objects",
    ", we can investigate the nature of llagns as a class , compare them with more luminous agns , and potentially constrain models for accretion flows .",
    "for example , the spectral properties ( continuum shape , absorption column , fe  k - line strength , presence or absence of ionized absorbers ) and variability characteristics can be used to probe the structure of the central engine , in a region of parameter space that is likely to be quite unique because of the extreme conditions involved . in the regime of low mass accretion rate",
    ", it has been suggested that advection - dominated accretion flows may be present ( narayan & yi 1994 ; see reviews by kato , fukue , & mineshige 1998 and quataert 2001 ) .",
    "comparisons between observations and theoretical predictions are critical for testing these and other ideas .",
    "x - ray observations of liners and llseyferts , both in the soft and hard energy bands , have been published by a number of authors .",
    "however , most , if not all , previous studies have been limited either by sample size or restricted energy bandwidth . in the soft x - ray band , data based on observations with _ einstein _  and _ rosat _  have been presented by halpern & steiner ( 1983 ) , koratkar et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , komossa , bhringer , & huchra ( 1999 ) , roberts & warwick ( 2000 ) , lira , lawrence , & johnson ( 2000 ) , and halderson et al .",
    "the primary disadvantages of observations in the soft x - ray band are contamination by emission from hot gas , often observed in galaxies , and decreased sensitivity to absorbed agns .",
    "the number of hard x - ray observations of liners and llseyferts prior to _ asca _ is very limited . because of sensitivity limitations ,",
    "only a few of the brightest objects have been observed ( e.g. , m81 and ngc 3998 ) . the significantly improved sensitivity and imaging capability in the broad energy band ( 0.510 kev ) of _ asca _ provide an unprecedent opportunity to study systematically objects with low - level activity .",
    "this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of _ asca _ observations of liners and llseyferts . in a subsequent paper ( terashima et al .",
    "2001 , hereinafter paper ii ) , we discuss the origin of the x - ray emission using the x - ray properties derived here , along with comparisons with data from other wavelengths , and the broader implications for llagns .",
    "previous _ asca _",
    "results based on smaller samples can be found in serlemitsos , ptak , & yaqoob ( 1996 ) , terashima ( 1998 , 1999a , 1999b ) , awaki ( 1999 ) , and ptak et al .",

    "notes on individual objects are given in section 9 .",
    "section 10 summarizes the main results .",
    "the galaxies in this study were chosen from the palomar survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "we selected objects classified by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) as liners and seyfert galaxies which were either in the _ asca _ data archives as of 1999 december or belonged to our own proprietary observing programs .",
    "we decided to analyze seyferts with @xmath13 @xmath15 ergs s@xmath1 , roughly the luminosity of ngc 4051 , the lowest luminosity `` classical '' seyfert galaxy .",
    "luminous seyferts which have been extensively studied were excluded .",
    "the list of galaxies we analyzed is shown in table 1 , where we list the hubble types , distances , heliocentric velocities , and optical spectroscopic classifications .",

    "we omitted a few objects with ambiguous spectral classification .",
    "the liner  2 ngc 4486 ( m87 ) was also excluded because of the complexity of its x - ray emission ( matsumoto et al .",
    "1996 ; reynolds et al . 1996 ; allen , di  matteo , & fabian 2000 ) . the x - ray spectrum of m87 consists of multiple components , namely emission from an agn and hot gas from the host galaxy and the virgo cluster . properly measuring the spectral parameters of the agn component",
    "requires detailed image analysis and a sophisticated modeling of the thermal emission , including the effects of multiple temperatures , metal abundances , and temperature and metalicity gradients .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the two transition objects ngc 4569 and ngc 4192 , which were analyzed by terashima et al .",

    "several objects in the southern hemisphere ( ngc 1097 , 1365 , 1386 , and 4941 ) , which have good _ asca _ data , were also used .",
    "the optical classifications for these objects were taken from phillips et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , storchi - bergmann , baldwin , & wilson ( 1993 ) , vron - cetty & vron ( 1986 ) , and storchi - bergmann & pastoriza ( 1989 ) .",
    "the final sample consists of nine liner  1s , 12 liner  2s , eight seyfert  1s , and nine seyfert  2s .",
    "some of these objects were observed at least twice with _",
    "whenever possible we analyzed the multiple observations to achieve better photon statistics and to search for variability . in total",
    "there are 53 observations , as summarized in table  2 .",
    "section 9 gives comments on the observations which were not used .",
    "a log of the _ asca _ observations is shown in table 2 .",
    "it gives the start date of the observations , observation modes , count rates obtained for the sis and gis detectors , and net exposure times after data screening .",
    "the gis detectors ( ohashi et al . 1996 ; makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) were operated in the ph mode with the nominal bit assignment for all the observations .",
    "the spread discriminator was not turned on in the observations of ngc 3079 , 4258 , and 5194 .",
    "the clocking and telemetry modes of the sis detectors ( burke et al . 1994 ; yamashita et al .",
    "1999 ) are also summarized in table 2 . in the sis observations ,",
    "in which both the faint and bright modes were used , the two data sets were combined after the faint - mode data were converted to the format of the bright - mode data ; the only exception was the 1995 observation of ngc 4579 ( see terashima et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "the data were screened using the following set of criteria : ( 1 ) elevation angle above the earth s limb greater than 5@xmath17 , ( 2 ) cut - off rigidity greater than 6 gev c@xmath1 , ( 3 ) avoidance of south atlantic anomaly , and ( 4 ) elevation angle above the day earth s limb greater than 25@xmath17 ( sis only ) . x - ray spectra and light curves were extracted from a circular region with a typical radius of 3@xmath184@xmath18 for sis and 6@xmath18 for gis .",
    "a smaller extraction radius was used in some cases to avoid a bright nearby source .",
    "background spectra were accumulated from a source - free region in the same field .",
    "we fitted the sis and gis spectra simultaneously using the xspec spectral - fitting package ( version 10 ) .",
    "the spectra of the two sis detectors were combined , as were those from the two gis detectors .",

    "the results of the spectral fits are presented in figures  1_a_1_l_. in each figure , the left column displays the sis spectra , the right column the gis spectra . within each plot , the upper panel shows the data and the best - fit model , and the lower panel shows the residuals of the fit . for multi - component models",
    ", we plot each component with a different line type in the upper panel .",
    "we fitted the spectra with a simple power - law model modified by photoelectric absorption along the line of sight .",
    "we added a gaussian component to those objects which showed an indication of a linelike emission feature around 6 kev .",
    "the results of the fits are shown in table 3 .",
    "errors are not shown for the fits with poor reduced @xmath20 because the error estimations using the @xmath21 criterion are not valid .",
    "acceptable fits were obtained for only several objects : ngc 3031 , 3147 , 3507 , 3998 , 4203 , 4579 ( 1998 observation ) , 4639 , and 5033 .",
    "the other objects show significant residuals in the soft - energy band and/or a more complicated continuum shape . in many objects",
    "emission lines are seen in the region 0.62 kev , indicative of the presence of a sub - kev thermal plasma . in the next subsection",
    "we evaluate a model consisting of a hard component and a soft thermal plasma component .",
    "several objects show both a heavily absorbed hard component and a less absorbed soft component . in order to fit such a spectral shape",
    ", we tried a partially covered power - law model .",
    "this model is equivalent to one consisting of a combination of an absorbed power law plus and a scattered power law , as is often observed in seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , turner et al .",
    "1997 ; awaki et al .",
    "2000 ) if one assumes that the power - law slopes of these two components are same .",
    "although the power - law slopes of the soft and hard components could be different , we assumed that they have the same slope because of limited photon statistics .",
    "we considered this model for ngc 1052 , 2273 , 2639 , 2655 , 4565 , and 4941 ; the results are shown in table 4 .",
    "some of these objects ( ngc 1052 , 2639 , 2655 , and 4565 ) seem to have a softer component accompanied by emission lines from a thermal plasma . in the next subsection",
    ", we examine a multi - component model which consists of a partially covered power law and a soft thermal plasma .",
    "we also tried a thermal bremsstrahlung model instead of a power - law model .",
    "again , we added a gaussian line when a linelike feature was seen around 6 kev",
    ". we did not attempt the thermal bremsstrahlung model for those objects with a heavily absorbed continuum shape , since the temperature can not be well determined and a heavily absorbed continuum is likely to indicate the presence of an obscured agn .",
    "the result of these fits are given in table 5 .",
    "again errors are not shown for the fits with poor reduced @xmath20 .",
    "this thermal model resulted in significantly worse fits for those objects which were well fitted with a power - law ( plus gaussian ) model , except for the relatively faint objects ngc 3507 and ngc 4639 , for which @xmath20 values similar to those of the power - law fits were obtained .",
    "note that these two galaxies are fainter than the rest of objects which are well fitted with a simple power - law model .",
    "only a few objects were represented successfully by a simple power - law model ; the majority indicated the presence of emission from a soft thermal plasma in addition to the hard component .",
    "therefore , we investigated multiple - component models .",
    "we first adopted a model consisting of an absorbed power law plus a raymond - smith ( rs ; raymond & smith 1977 ) thermal plasma modified by galactic absorption .",
    "the abundance was allowed to vary only if a meaningful constraint could be obtained .",
    "in many cases the abundance was not well constrained and was fixed at 0.1 solar or 0.5 solar , values typically observed for thermal plasmas in normal and starburst galaxies . a gaussian line was also added if a linelike feature was seen around 6 kev .",
    "when the continuum shape suggests the presence of both a heavily absorbed and a lightly absorbed component , we used a partially covered power - law model instead of a simple power law ; this applied to ngc 1052 , 2655 , and 4565 .",
    "both models were tried for ngc 2639 .",
    "the results of the fits are summarized in table 6 .",
    "the fits were successful for all the objects except ngc 4258 ( 1993 observation ) and ngc 4636 , which show very complicated spectra .",
    "thus , a model consisting of an rs plasma plus a hard power - law component can be applied to nearly all objects , with a few objects not requiring the soft component .",
    "this `` canonical '' model successfully represents the spectra of the liners and llseyferts discussed here .",
    "ptak et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that this model was also applicable to starburst galaxies .    in objects",
    "whose continuum was not heavily absorbed , we also evaluated the possibility that in the two - component model the power law could be substituted by a thermal bremsstrahlung model . in all the cases , we obtained @xmath20 values ( table  7 ) similar to those for the rs plasma plus power - law model .",
    "some objects show apparently weak fe  l emission compared to other emission lines such as the k lines from o , ne , mg , and si .",
    "for these objects , we fitted the abundances of fe and the @xmath12-processed elements separately .",
    "we fixed the abundances of the @xmath12-processed elements at 0.5 solar because the photon statistics are too limited to allow these abundances to be constrained individually .",
    "the abundance of fe was allowed to vary .",
    "we assumed a power - law shape for the hard component in these fits .",
    "only objects with a relatively good signal - to - noise ratio for the soft component were fitted with this model .",
    "the results are tabulated in table 8 .",
    "the @xmath20 values show improvement for ngc 1097 , 3079 , 4636 , and 5194 , compared to the case of a rs plasma with solar abundance ratios .",
    "the spectra of only two objects , ngc 4258 ( 1993 observation ) and ngc 4636 , can not be fitted with the models described above . as discussed in section 9 , we applied more complex models to these objects .",
    "tables 9 and 10 summarize the parameters of the fe k emission line . adding a gaussian component to the best - fit continuum model improved the @xmath20 values ( @xmath22 ) for the 16 objects shown in table 9 .",
    "the additional parameters in the fit are the center energy , line width , and line intensity . in cases where the photon statistics are limited",
    ", we assumed the line to be narrow .",
    "for ngc 2639 , the line center energy was fixed at 6.4 kev in the source rest frame .",
    "table 10 gives upper limits for the rest of the objects in which the fe k emission line is not clearly seen .",
    "we summarize the best - fit models and parameters for all the spectral classes .",
    "tables 11 and 12 present results for the soft and hard components , respectively .",
    "these tables show that the spectra of most of the objects analyzed here are well represented by the canonical model and that a small fraction of liner 1s , seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s do not require the soft rs component .",
    "thus , this canonical spectrum appears to be widely applicable to liners and llseyferts .",
    "figure  2 shows histograms of the spectral parameters ( photon index , absorption column , and temperature for the rs component ) for each spectral class . since the errors of the spectral parameters for many objects are large , we present _ weighted _ histograms , where the same area of a rectangle is assigned to each data set and the width of the rectangle is the error range in the spectral fits . in generating the histograms of photon indices and absorption column densities , we excluded objects with very low signal - to - noise ratios or cases where the photon index was not well constrained ( ngc 404 , 1386 , 4192 , and 7743 ) .",
    "the histogram of the temperature of the rs component is created using objects which clearly show the presence of the soft thermal component .",
    "the objects for which the temperature was not well constrained were excluded .",
    "the distribution of photon indices for the four spectral classes are similar to each other , although liner  2s and seyfert  2s have somewhat broader distribution than liner  1s and seyfert  1s .",
    "this difference is possibly due to the larger errors in the type  2 objects .",
    "the distributions of the absorption column densities appear different from each other . very large column densities  in excess of @xmath6 @xmath7  are observed in several seyfert  2s , one liner  1 ( ngc 1052 ) , and one seyfert  1 ( ngc 4258 , 1993 observation ) .",
    "no liner  2s in the present sample are obscured by @xmath23 @xmath7 .",
    "we note that in objects with very high columns ( @xmath24 @xmath7 ) , only scattered emission would be seen , and the _ apparent _ ( observed ) column densities would be much lower than the true column densities .",
    "such is the situation in ngc 1365 and ngc 5194 .",
    "the temperature of the rs component is confined to the range 0.50.8 kev .",
    "this distribution is similar to that presented by ptak et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a smaller , more heterogeneous sample of liners , seyferts , and starburst galaxies .    apart from the absorption column densities , which exhibit greater diversity , the spectral parameters of the liners and seyferts in our sample are rather homogeneous .",
    "the canonical model we have adopted , however , can also be applied to starburst galaxies and normal galaxies ( e.g. , ptak et al .",
    "the apparent similarity of the spectra , therefore , does not in itself imply that the different classes of objects share the same x - ray production mechanism , nor does it necessarily mean that they are physically related .",
    "recall that , with very few exceptions , the hard component of the spectral fit could just as well be represented by a power law or a thermal bremsstrahlung model . therefore , we need to analyze carefully all the available information  morphology , variability , and multiwavelength information  before we can draw firm conclusions regarding the nature of these sources .",
    "this is the subject of paper ii .",
    "the total x - ray fluxes and luminosities , and the respective quantities for the the hard and soft components separately , are listed in tables 13 and 14 .",
    "the best - fit model was assumed to calculate them . as for the hard component",
    ", we assumed a power law rather than a thermal bremsstrahlung model for all the cases , since the power - law model gave better or similar results compared to a thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the total ( soft plus hard components ) fluxes and luminosities in the 0.52 kev and 210 kev bands are shown in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the observed and absorption - corrected fluxes and luminosities for the power - law component are given in columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) for the 210 kev band , and in columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) for the 0.54 kev band .",
    "since the estimated fluxes and luminosities of the soft component depend on the assumed abundance , we show two cases ( abundance = 0.1 solar and 0.5 solar ) if the abundance was assumed in the fits .",
    "the fluxes and luminosities of the hard component depend only weakly on the assumed abundance of the soft component .",
    "x - ray variability is one of the most important characteristics of agns .",

    "<S> the x - ray spectra of most objects are well described by a canonical model which consists of ( 1 ) a soft component from a thermal plasma with @xmath3 kev and ( 2 ) a hard component represented by a power law with a photon index of @xmath4 or thermal bremsstrahlung emission with @xmath5 10 kev . </S>",
    "<S> several objects do not require the soft thermal component , and their continua are well fitted by a single power - law model . </S>",
    "<S> some objects show heavy absorption with column densities in excess of @xmath6 @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect in several objects fe  k line emission with equivalent widths ranging from 50 ev to 2 kev .    </S>",
    "<S> variability on timescales less than a day is uncommon in our sample . by comparing multiple observations made with _ </S>",
    "<S> asca _ or with published 210 kev observations from other satellites , we show that at least eight objects are variable on timescales of a week to several years . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the morphologies of many objects , both in the soft and hard bands , are consistent with being pointlike relative to the telescope point - spread function ; a few are clearly extended in either or both energy bands </S>",
