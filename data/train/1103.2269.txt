    "qcd string is formed at the distances larger than the confinement scale and is described by an effective string theory , which has a well - defined semiclassical expansion around a long - string ground state .",
    "the leading order , known as the lscher term  @xcite , is universal and possesses a number of remarkable properties , owing to the fact that the transverse size of the long string is also large . the number of transverse degrees of freedom of the effective string resides in an overall coefficient of the lscher term , which is the only input parameter that equals @xmath0 for a bosonic string in @xmath1 space - time dimensions .",
    "a long - standing idea is to extract physical consequences directly from this well - established picture of qcd string .",
    "i consider in this letter two cases where qcd string is outstretched , so that the effective string theory is applicable : a rectangular wilson loop , determining the static potential , and meson scattering amplitudes in the regge kinematical regime , determining the reggeon trajectory .",
    "i emphasize similarities between these two cases and describe how they can be solved in the mean - field approximation , which is justified by large @xmath1 , but turns out to be exact at any @xmath1 .",
    "i take into account contributions to the scattering amplitudes from both qcd string and perturbative qcd and discuss some experimental consequences .",
    "a linear static potential @xmath2 between heavy quarks in qcd corresponds to the area - law behavior of a @xmath3 rectangular wilson loop w(rt ) = ^-t v(r ) [ potential ] for @xmath4 and results in quark confinement .",
    "this implies that the gluon field forms a flux tube or a string for @xmath5 larger than the confinement scale .    in string theory a linear potential",
    "is associated with a classical string , while a quantization of an outstretched string with the dirichlet boundary condition in @xmath1 dimensions yields  @xcite v(r)= , [ vstring ] where @xmath6 is the string tension .",
    "equation  ( [ vstring ] ) was first obtained  @xcite in the large-@xmath1 limit , where only transverse degrees of freedom are essential , and then derived  @xcite by the virasoro quantization of the string with the dirichlet boundary condition . what was most important with the formula in eq .",
    "( [ vstring ] ) was a recognition of the fact that it to be exact for any @xmath1 order by order in @xmath7 , since the lorentz anomaly vanishes at large @xmath5 so the quantization is consistent  @xcite .",
    "the root in eq .",
    "( [ vstring ] ) becomes imaginary for small distances , which is related to tachyonic instability , but there is no tachyon for long strings .    for a covariant quantization",
    "the lorentz anomaly is translated into the virasoro anomaly .",
    "it is now possible to describe qcd string in @xmath8 by an effective string theory with a nonpolynomial action  @xcite @xmath9 where the conformal anomaly is expressed ( modulo total derivatives and the constraints ) via an induced metric ^_ind = 2 x    polyakov formulation .",
    "it was shown  @xcite by analyzing the effective string theory order by order in @xmath10 that the virasoro anomaly vanishes and the spectrum reproduces that  @xcite of the nambu ",

    "the consideration of scattering amplitudes for qcd string is pretty much similar to the above analysis of the static potential .",
    "they are given by a momentum - space disk amplitude for ( smeared ) stepwise  @xcite p^(t)=1_i p_i^ 12 _ i p_i^sign(t - t_i ) , [ stepx ] where @xmath11 is a parametrization of the momentum - space loop @xmath12 and @xmath13 will play the role of a regularization .",
    "the ( smeared ) discontinuities of the step function  ( [ stepx ] ) correspond to momenta of colliding particles ( all of them are considered as incoming ) .",
    "such a momentum - space loop is closed as a consequence of the momentum conservation . for @xmath14 ,",
    "when the action is quadratic , this momentum - space amplitude coincides with the usual coordinate - space disk amplitude for the polygonal loop x^(t)= 2 p^(t ) , [ xp ] whose vertices @xmath15 obey @xmath16 .",

    ", quantum fluctuations can be taken into account in a semiclassical approximation resulting in the lscher term  @xcite , which is well - known for a @xmath3 rectangle with @xmath30 : @xmath31 we shall now demonstrate how this shifts the reggeon intercept .",

    "it is clear that each set of modes results in the lscher term = 124 t [ trvsst ] for @xmath37 .",
    "there are @xmath38 such sets , so their contribution to the intercept of the regge trajectory is  @xcite ( 0)=.

    "@xmath14 it comes  @xcite now from the path integral over reparametrizations ( or the boundary metrics ) , while for @xmath39 the classical part @xmath35 in the decomposition  ( [ deco ] ) additionally contributes through the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "( [ ellik ] ) , is known as the grtzsch modulus which is monotonic in @xmath28 .",

    "the quadratic fluctuations around this mean field are stable for @xmath56 , i.e.  for - t > .",

    "qcd string is stretched between quarks , when they are moved apart , and makes sense of an effective string theory .",

    "therefore , the above reggeon trajectory is of physical relevance for qcd .",
    "the linear trajectory  ( [ linear ] ) can not extend to very large values of @xmath63 , where perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is applicable .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the reggeization of the @xmath64 trajectory in pqcd is due to double logarithms coming ( in the axial gauge ) from ladder diagrams and resulting in the @xmath18 amplitude a=-1^(s/^2 ) = .5 , where @xmath65 is the bessel function and @xmath66  gev is an infrared cutoff in pqcd .",
    "strictly speaking , the running of @xmath67 with @xmath50 is beyond the accuracy of the calculation , but it is expected from asymptotic freedom and provides the asymptote @xmath68 as @xmath69 , which follows from the quark counting rule .    in the sum - over - path representation of meson scattering amplitudes in qcd the separation of pqcd and qcd string can be performed by splitting the integral over the proper time into two domains : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the domain @xmath70 is associated with small paths and , correspondingly , pqcd , while domain @xmath71 is associated with large paths and , correspondingly , qcd string .",

    "they can be described by an effective string theory , which is an effective description for the degrees of freedom of long strings . in this situation",
    "it does not matter what is the actual qcd string ( if any ) which makes sense for all distances .",
    "two such candidates for qcd string are :    * migdal s elfin string  @xcite , whose worldsheet is populated by two - dimensional elementary fermions ; * holography based on the ads / cft correspondence in a confining background , where extra degrees of freedom are described by higher dimensions .    in both cases the extra degrees of freedom are needed to provide asymptotic freedom at small distances , but at the distances larger than the confinement scale the mean - field approach apparently works well , reproducing the same results as for the nambu ",
    "goto string .",
    "this issue will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "the ways the dirichlet disk amplitude ( reproducing the static potential ) and the scattering amplitude ( reproducing the linear reggeon trajectory ) are considered are pretty much similar , although the latter refers , strictly speaking , to scattering of tachyons , when the reparametrization path integral decouples .",
    "in qcd we deal with off - shell scattering amplitudes , when the reparametrization path integral plays a crucial role in maintaining the projective symmetry . the path integral over reparametrizations obeying @xmath94 yields  @xcite = for the ( singular ) green function at coinciding arguments , which is associated with the lovelace reggeon vertex that results in consistent off - shell scattering amplitudes  @xcite , reproducing the above results .",
    "there is , however , a big difference in the square - root behavior of the static potential  ( [ vstring ] ) and the linear reggeon trajectory  ( [ linear ] ) of qcd string .",
