    "in the last years , spin - glass models without spin - inversion symmetry @xcite have received a large amount of attention : probably the main reason for this big effort is that they are thought to describe structural glasses that in nature , as opposed to spin glasses , do not enjoy this symmetry .",
    "one of them , the ferro - potts - glass ( fpg),@xcite is a very direct generalization of the ising edwards - anderson spin glass : the spins can take @xmath3 different values , and two neighboring spins contribute to the total energy a factor @xmath4 if they are in the same state and a factor @xmath5 if they are in different states .",
    "the bonds @xmath6 are quenched random variables that can be distributed , for example , under a gaussian or under a bimodal distribution . in the fpg ,",
    "as we will discuss better in the following , the missing spin - inversion symmetry has the collateral effect of allowing the existence of a ferromagnetic phase at low values of the temperature ( this is why we define it ferro - potts - glass ) : because of this possible contamination the analysis of the glassy critical points of the model can potentially become very complex , and even lead to misleading conclusions .",
    "in fact , as we will discuss below , progress can be expected from the consideration of more refined models , where a gauge symmetry forbids the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the fpg is a candidate for describing orientational glasses : a @xmath3-state spin models a quadrupole moment which can be directed in @xmath3 ( discrete ) directions.@xcite however , its main interest is maybe originated from some of the properties of its infinite - range version : for @xmath7 , for example , the mean field fpg undergoes a glass transition@xcite where the order parameter is discontinuous.@xcite a number of different lattice models,@xcite in other words , can be analyzed to clarify the finite - range behavior of systems showing the equilibrium properties typical of glasses : it is also important to remember that a number of important connections have been found@xcite between the mean - field dynamical equations of the model and the mode - coupling theory of the structural glass transition,@xcite that describes the evolution of the density correlations in a supercooled liquid above the dynamical transition temperature .    even if the mean - field results can be an important starting point , in a next step , since real systems have short - range interactions , it is important to study finite dimensional systems .",
    "great part of the mainly numerical effort has been focused on the @xmath8 model in @xmath1 , to model a realistic quadrupolar glass.@xcite the first numerical studies@xcite found that the lower critical dimension @xmath9 is close to @xmath2 . in a numerical study with a zero - temperature scaling approach , banavar and",
    "cieplak@xcite suggested that the fpg with gaussian couplings has a @xmath9 slightly greater than @xmath2 , while the fpg with bimodal couplings has a @xmath9 slightly below @xmath2 ( but such a measurement had large intrinsic errors ) . a few months later monte carlo simulations@xcite hinted that the transition seems to take place at a temperature compatible with @xmath10 for both families of couplings , which suggested indeed that @xmath11 .",
    "further simulations in the bimodal@xcite and gaussian@xcite models were consistent with these results , although one could not exclude the possibility of @xmath12 being small but larger than zero .",
    "a later study based on a high - temperature expansion@xcite did not allow to reach a final conclusion .",
    "only recently we start to have clearer evidences about the situation : a large scale numerical study , based on a finite size scaling analysis of the correlation length @xcite , gives what looks like a reliable evidence of a transition to a glass phase at finite @xmath12 , making in this way a strong case for @xmath9 being slightly below @xmath2 for the three - state fpg .",
    "another interesting model that has been studied in detail is the @xmath13 model in @xmath1 , because of the intrinsic interest of the limit of a large number of states . old@xcite and recent@xcitenumerical simulations seem to suggest that there is no spin glass transition at finite temperature ( but all the warnings about the dangers of ferromagnetic effects at low @xmath14 in this model stay in effect ) .",
    "this finding is in marked contrast with the predictions of mean field theory that indeed undergoes two transitions:@xcite new models could be useful to understand better the connections among the mean field and the finite dimensional picture , and for example potts - glass models with medium - range interactions@xcite could be relevant at this effect",
    ".    it has also been argued@xcite ( although some controversy exists@xcite ) that the choice of the coupling distribution might be relevant in removing the phase transition on the @xmath13 model .",
    "the disease of the fpg that we have discussed before is the designated culprit : the lack of the spin inversion symmetry ( which in ising spin glasses is connected to a gauge symmetry that forbids a spontaneous magnetization@xcite ) allows ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures.@xcite a partial relief to this problem can be obtained by using a distribution of couplings non - symmetric around zero,@xcite but this choice does not recover the lost ( important ) gauge invariance .    a different ( and natural ) definition of a frustrated potts model containing quenched disorder ,",
    "the random permutation potts glass ( rppg ) , has been introduced a few years ago.@xcite the key point of the rppg ( and of the similar model where only a set of possible couplings is allowed , the commutative random permutation potts glass , crppg , where an additional symmetry is very useful to help checking thermalization , see [ model ] ) is that it retains the gauge invariance which prevents ising spin - glasses from entering ferromagnetic ordering at low temperature .",
    "the same paper@xcite analyzed numerically the @xmath15 , four - dimensional model ( both in the rppg and in the crppg versions ) on lattices of volume @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the two models were found to exhibit the same critical behavior , with a glassy phase characterized by a divergence of the overlap susceptibility .",
    "a preliminary value of @xmath18 was estimated from that divergence , and the critical temperature was obtained from the analysis of the binder parameter : the critical behavior was found to be reached under a discontinuity , that was related to the one observed in the random energy model.@xcite it is also interesting to note that carlucci@xcite has discussed the relation connecting the ( c)rppg and the chiral potts model introduced by nishimori and stephen,@xcite which in mean field shows the same type of transition for @xmath7.@xcite the authors of ref . also present a dynamical study of their models , and they observe clear aging effects .    in this work we investigate , by means of monte carlo simulation and finite - size scaling analysis , the critical properties of the three and of the four dimensional @xmath15 crppg . in @xmath1 , the finite - size behavior makes possible that the system undergoes a kosterlitz - thouless transition , although a @xmath9 barely lower than @xmath2 is surely compatible with the significance of our numerical data . in @xmath0 , we confirm the existence of the spin - glass transition reported in ref .  , but the use of a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) computer ( see the appendix and ref .  ) allows us to obtain more accurate estimates of the critical exponents , universal dimensionless quantities and non universal critical couplings of the model .    the remaining part of this work is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we define the model and comment on its symmetries .",
    "we describe the relevant observables in section  [ observables ] .",
    "section  [ montecarlosect ] is devoted to a discussion of the numerical methods : the details of the simulations are described in section  [ simulations ] and the finite - size scaling method in section  [ fss ] .",
    "further details about the computation are given in section  [ comp_details ] , while the problem of thermalization is addressed in section  [ thermalization ] .",
    "the results for the @xmath1 model are discussed in section  [ results3d ] , and those for @xmath0 are discussed in section  [ results4d ] .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] . in the appendix",
    "we give details about the fpga and about how they have actually been used .",
    "we consider a system of spins @xmath19 defined on a @xmath1 ( and @xmath0 ) dimensional simple cubic lattice of linear size _",
    "( volume @xmath20 ) and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath21 where the sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighboring sites .",
    "the spins can take the values @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are quenched permutations of @xmath22 , defined on the links of the lattice.@xcite we define our quenched couplings ( to implement the commutative model of ref . ) by extracting random permutations of @xmath24 that commute with our `` reference permutation '' @xmath25 .",
    "only links from @xmath26 to @xmath27 such that @xmath28 give a non - zero contribution to the energy .",
    "the rppg and crppg are deeply connected@xcite to the chiral - potts model analyzed by nishimori and stephen.@xcite    the symmetry with respect to the reference permutation @xmath29 helps in defining an order parameter @xmath30 governed by a probability distribution symmetric under @xmath31 ( this turns out to be crucial for checking that the system has reached thermal equilibrium@xcite ) .",
    "we define two copies of the system ( two real replicas ) @xmath32 and we allow them to evolve independently at the same temperature and the same realization of quenched random couplings @xmath23 .",
    "the _ modified _ overlap between the two replicas at site @xmath26 is defined as @xmath33      the main quantities that we will consider here are defined in terms of the fourier transform of @xmath34 : @xmath35 the momentum space propagator is defined from the relation : @xmath36 in the thermodynamic limit and at the critical point , the propagator is expected to have poles at @xmath37 : @xmath38 where the correlation length @xmath39 diverges at the critical point , and @xmath40 .",
    "we also define the non - connected susceptibility : @xmath41 on a finite lattice an extremely useful definition of the correlation length can be obtained from the discrete derivative of @xmath42 . using @xmath43 , where @xmath44 belongs to the canonical cartesian basis , one obtains:@xcite @xmath45 we also compute and analyze the cumulant : @xmath46 we define the energy as : @xmath47 so that it lays in the @xmath48 $ ] interval . when we need to estimate the derivative with respect to @xmath49 of an observable @xmath50 , we estimate it by measuring the connected correlation function @xmath51 .",
    "bias - corrected@xcite reweighting techniques@xcite allow us to use the numerical data taken at temperature @xmath14 to compute expectation values at nearby temperature values @xmath52 , and to get in this way estimates that cover all the relevant part of the critical region .",
    "in the @xmath1 model we have analyzed lattices of linear sizes @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the critical behavior of the model ( see section  [ results3d ] ) has suggested to simulate a wide range of values of @xmath49 , ranging from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "we have analyzed between @xmath57 and @xmath58 different samples of the smaller systems and around @xmath59 samples for @xmath60 .    in @xmath0 , we have analyzed lattices of linear sizes @xmath61 and @xmath54 , with @xmath49 ranging from @xmath62 to @xmath55 .",
    "the main computer effort has been accomplished around @xmath63 and @xmath64 , close to the critical point . at these temperatures",
    ", we have simulated @xmath59 samples for @xmath65 and @xmath66 samples for @xmath67 .",
    "for the other @xmath49 values we have simulated between @xmath57 and @xmath58 samples .",
    "we have also analyzed @xmath68 samples of the system deep into the low - temperature region , at @xmath69 .",
    "we give here a few details about the finite size scaling approach that we have used for our analysis . when using the _ _ quotient method__@xcite one compares the mean value of an observable @xmath50 , in two systems of sizes @xmath70 and @xmath71 , using the value @xmath49 where the correlation length in units of the lattice sizes coincides for both systems .",
    "if , for the infinite volume system , @xmath72 the basic equation of the quotient method is : @xmath73 where the dots stand for higher - order scaling corrections , @xmath74 is the correlation length critical exponent , @xmath75 is the ( universal ) first irrelevant critical exponent , and @xmath76 is a non universal amplitude .    just below the lower critical dimension , at a distance @xmath77 , the critical exponent @xmath78",
    "is expected to be of order @xmath77 .",
    "this means that , for a limited range of lattice sizes , the slope of the @xmath79 curves at @xmath12 grows very slowly ( almost logarithmically ) with @xmath80 .",
    "this could make life hard for a numerical study where one looks for a crossing of the @xmath79 curves , since the curves for the different lattice sizes would be basically parallel in the critical region .",
    "in other words , distinguishing a _ merging _ of the @xmath79 curves from a _ crossing _ becomes very hard .",
    "if one works precisely at the lower critical dimension ( i.e. @xmath81 ) , one may expect that one of two mutually excluding scenarios is realized .",
    "if @xmath10 , the curves for @xmath79 would not join ( if plotted versus @xmath82 , the curves for lattices of size @xmath80 and @xmath83 should displace uniformly by a @xmath80-independent amount ) . on the other hand , if @xmath84 one would have a kosterlitz - thouless picture , where the curves for @xmath79 merge for all @xmath85 .",
    "it is clear that distinguishing a kosterlitz - thouless scenario from @xmath86 but very small is numerically challenging .    the most precise way of extracting the critical point @xmath87 is to consider the crossing point of dimensionless quantities such as @xmath79 and @xmath88 .",
    "when comparing their values in two systems of size @xmath70 and @xmath71 , one finds that they take a common value at @xmath89 the non universal amplitude @xmath90 depends on the dimensionless quantity that one considers .",
    ".for each lattice size of the @xmath1 model , we show the simulated temperatures , number of samples , number of emcs per sample and emcs per measurement . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the cumulant @xmath88 scales like @xmath79 at the critical point , it might have played the same role than @xmath79 ( by using eq .",
    "[ ajuste ] ) .",
    "however , we find that it has much larger scaling corrections than @xmath79 , and that these corrections shift the crossing points to higher temperatures , out of the range that we have analyzed ( and where we believe the real asymptotic critical behavior can be observed ) .",
    "we have therefore not used @xmath88 in our study of the critical point .",
    "our results compare fairly with the ones obtained in ref .   by analyzing systems of linear sizes @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( @xmath49",
    "must be renormalized since our hamiltonian differs by a factor @xmath93 from the one of ref .  ) .    to obtain the critical exponents we consider the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 , whose associated exponents , see eq .",
    "[ quotients - formula ] , are @xmath96 and @xmath97 . taking the logarithm of the quotients of these expectation values at the crossing points of @xmath79 , we obtain the effective size - dependent exponents that we show in table  [ tab : crit_4d ] .",
    "we can summarize our best estimate for the @xmath98 exponents as @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 : these error are statistical in nature and can not , obviously , fully take care of the systematic effects .",
    "as was happening in the determination of the value of the critical coupling , the estimated exponents lack the precision necessary for obtaining a reliable infinite volume extrapolation . ref",
    ".   was quoting a value of @xmath18 in the range between @xmath104 and @xmath55 , obtained from the study of the overlap susceptibility in the warm phase of a lattice @xmath65 .",
    "although our estimate is not very close to this value , it is clear that we are still dealing with lattice of intermediate size , and that a careful analysis of scaling corrections , that we hope will soon be possible , will probably lead to reconcile these results .",
    "our results should characterizes , if universality holds , the spin glass transition to a potts glass , independently from the detailed model one selects .",
    "finally , we also show in table  [ tab : crit_4d ] the finite - size estimates of the universal quantity @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath79 evaluated at the critical coupling .",
    "we have presented a numerical study of the @xmath106-state crppg in @xmath0 , and , for the first time , in @xmath1 : we have used monte carlo simulations , reweighting techniques and a finite size scaling analysis . in @xmath1",
    "our evidence clearly shows that we are very close to the lower critical dimension , and suggests that a kosterlitz - thouless like behavior is possible , even if we could be dealing with a transient effect . in @xmath0",
    "we are able to collect a large number of thermalized samples for systems defined on large lattices , of linear size @xmath60 .",
    "thanks to such a large scale numerical simulation we are able to qualify the spin - glass transition first found in ref .  , and we obtain size - dependent estimates of the critical coupling , of the critical exponents @xmath74 and @xmath107 and of the scale - invariant quantity @xmath105    in both cases , the use of a fpga gives us the power needed to achieve thermalization , a target very ambitious for standard computers .",
    "we have been very careful in checking thermalization , and also thanks to the built - in symmetry of the crppg we have succeeded in this task .",
    "numerical computations have been performed at bifi .",
    "we acknowledge partial financial support from cam - ucm and ucm - bsch , and from mec through research contracts fis2006 - 08533-c03 and tec2007 - 64188 .",
    "j.  l. velasco is a dga fellow .",
    "we thank stefano mossa , giorgio parisi and cristina picus for a number of conversations about the glassy potts models and more .",
    "we thank raffaele tripiccione and all the janus collaboration for a continuous help that could not have been more important for us .",
    "the problem of the glassy state , for example , is a typical problem of very high complexity .",
    "a large ( maybe infinite ) number of time scales is involved , and numerical simulations have to try to give hints about dynamics at very long times : very large correlation and thermalization times imply that , already on lattices of medium size , a huge computational effort is required .",
    "this is a typical situation where conventional computers could be not enough to do the job .",
    "the use of fpga programmable chips for the simulation of spin systems has been proposed several years ago@xcite : conventional computers are not optimized towards the computational tasks relevant for our typical calculation , and a fpga can be programmed ( at run time ) in order to optimize the execution of the specific problem that one wants to solve .",
    "fpga devices comes with numerous embedded and sizable memory blocks ( ram blocks ) , and thousands of configurable logic blocks with programmable interconnections .",
    "a configurable logic blocks can be programmed to perform complex logic operations and provide storage ( flip - flop registers ) at the same time .",
    "a number of features that characterize our model are indeed optimal for being dealt with by a fpga : we have discrete variables that can take a small number of values ( four for our @xmath15 system ) , and the interaction is local in physical space . the metropolis algorithm and the random number generators discussed in section  [ comp_details ]",
    "have been implemented in the fpga in a very effective way .",
    "ram blocks have a natural @xmath108 ( width @xmath109 depth ) grid structure . a @xmath110 cubic matrix of bits can be obtained by _ stacking _ many of them , and access to all of them with the same memory address corresponds to addressing an entire plane in a @xmath110 grid .",
    "we consider one such structure per each bit needed to represent fields ( and interactions ) defined on the sites of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "locality of interactions ( nearest neighbors ) allows for a high grade of internal parallelism : in a checkerboard scheme , all black or all white sites of a lattice plane can be updated simultaneously ( i. e. at the same clock cycle ) .",
    "moreover , when simulating two real replicas and mixing black ( white ) sites of a system with white ( black ) ones of its replica , all sites in a plane can be processed in parallel .",
    "simultaneous local updates can then be performed by replicating small computation cells , each executing the few simple logical operations to compute local energies , and including a 32 bit comparator for the metropolis test .",
    "precomputed transition probabilities ( that allows to avoid lengthy computations of transcendental functions ) are stored as several small look - up tables in configurable logic ( _ distributed _ ram ) , and addressed by the computed energy variations values ( each look - up tables serves two distinct computation cells ) .",
    "the iterative processes involving 32 bit integer arithmetics for random number generators have also been _",
    "parallelized _ , by cascading many 32 bit integer adders and _ _ xor__s , and allowing for the generation of hundreds of 32 bit random numbers per clock cycle . for further details ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "we use the fpga device virtex 4/lx200 , manufactured by xilinx . depending on lattice size and number of parallel updates ( between @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) our designs run at clock speeds between @xmath68 and @xmath113 mhz .    in ref .",
    "its performances have been compared with the ones of a @xmath114 ghz pentium iv device : for the @xmath1 model the fpga performs 1800 times faster than a pentium , while this factor is @xmath115 in @xmath0 .",
