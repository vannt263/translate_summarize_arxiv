    "a large number of technical applications include chemically reacting flows comprising an interplay between convective and diffusive species transport and chemical reaction processes . due to the large number of chemical species involved and the stiffness of the kinetic ordinary differential equations ( ode ) with time scales ranging from nanoseconds to seconds , simulation of chemically reacting flows ( for instance in combustion processes ) is often nearly impossible in reasonable computing time , whenever using detailed reaction mechanism models .",
    "this calls for multiscale approaches and appropriate model reduction techniques .    in chemical reaction kinetics modeled by dissipative ode systems with spectral gaps",
    "it is observed that solution trajectories bundle near invariant manifolds of successively lower dimension during time evolution caused by the multiple time scales generating spectral gaps .",
    "this time scale separation of the model solution into fast and slow modes is the basis for most model and complexity reduction techniques , where the long time scale system dynamics is approximated via elimination of the fast relaxing modes by enslaving them to the slow ones .",
    "the outcome of this is in the ideal case an invariant manifold of slow motion ( denoted as slow invariant manifold ( sim ) ) possessing the property of attracting system trajectories from arbitrary initial values .",
    "many model reduction methods make use of a species reconstruction technique for sim approximation which is provided by an implicitly defined function mapping a subset of the chemical species of the full model  called reaction progress variables ( rpvs)onto the full species composition by determining a point on a sim .    among the first model reduction methods",
    "have been the quasi  steady  state assumption ( qssa ) @xcite and the partial equilibrium approximation ( pea ) @xcite . in the qssa approach",
    "certain species are supposed to be in steady state whereas in the pea approach several ( fast ) reactions are assumed to be in equilibrium .",
    "due to their conceptual simplicity both the qssa and the pea are still used nowadays although more sophisticated model reduction methods have been developed . in 1992",
    "maas and pope introduced the intrinsic low dimensional manifold ( ildm ) method @xcite which has become very popular and widely used in the reactive flow community , in particular in combustion applications .",
    "however , both qssa / pea manifolds and ildms are not invariant .",
    "other popular techniques are computational singular perturbation ( csp ) @xcite proposed by lam in 1985 , the method described in @xcite , which is based on equation - free approaches , and in @xcite , the relaxation redistribution method has recently been published .",

    "describe a method , where finite - time lyapunov exponents and vectors are used to determine slow manifolds @xcite .",
    "the use of those manifolds for the numerical solution of differential equations is obvious in the g - scheme @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are other approaches , whereof a few are presented in chapter [ chapterthree ] of this work , including the invariant constrained equilibrium edge preimage curve ( ice - pic ) introduced by ren et al .  in 2006",
    "@xcite , an iterative model reduction method called zero  derivative principle ( zdp ) presented in @xcite , the flow curvature method proposed by ginoux in @xcite , the functional equation truncation ( fet ) approach by roussel @xcite , and methods by adrover et al .",

    "@xcite . additionally , there is a trajectory  based optimization approach based on a variational principle proposed by lebiedz et al .",
    ", described in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is the discussion of common ideas and concepts underlying diverse kinetic model reduction approaches . in particular , various points of view on the latter variational principle are presented yielding a deeper insight into its fundamental ideas and its relation to other techniques for sim identification .",
    "this paper considers two ode test models for sim computation , both well suited for analytical treatment due to the availability of explicit formula for the sim to be approximated by various model reduction techniques .",
    "those systems are two  dimensional allowing a clear visualization of phase space dynamics .",
    "the first system is the linear model    [ linsys ] @xmath0    with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , whereas the second system is a nonlinear one , the davis  skodje model @xcite    [ ds ] @xmath4    in both cases @xmath5 measures the spectral gap in the system meaning that varying this parameter modifies the degree of attraction of the sim . in the linear system",
    "the sim obviously corresponds to the slow eigenspace of the system matrix , for the davis  skodje model the sim is the stable manifold of the fixed point @xmath6 which is tangent to the slow eigenspace of the system jacobian evaluated at @xmath6 .",
    "general analytical solutions are given by    [ ansol ] @xmath7    for the linear model and by    [ ansolds ] @xmath8    for the nonlinear davis  skodje model , with integration constants @xmath9 to be determined by setting initial values .",
    "for the linear system ( [ linsys ] ) , trajectory  based model reduction in terms of eliminating the fast modes implies here setting @xmath10 equal to zero which leads to    [ redansol ] @xmath11    resulting in the sim @xmath12 .",
    "the same procedure applied to the davis ",
    "skodje model yields @xmath13 for the sim .    in general , an autonomous kinetic ode model can be formulated as @xmath14 with @xmath15 modeling the full composition state vector of the system .",
    "most kinetic model reduction approaches define a subset of the state variables , the rpvs @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the index set for the rpvs that parameterize a sim .",
    "species reconstruction is the process of fixing the rpvs at a given point in time @xmath18 and determining the free variables ( non rpvs ) @xmath19 from @xmath20 , which implicitly defines a species reconstruction function @xmath21 mapping the rpvs to the full species composition thus determining a point on a sim .",
    "regarding the linear model ( [ linsys ] ) and its solution ( [ ansol ] ) with @xmath22 , elimination of the fast mode leads to @xmath23 , that is @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the species reconstruction function .",
    "we call @xmath26 the point of interest ( poi ) in the following .    model reduction by species reconstruction for initial value problem ( [ linsys ] ) together with @xmath27 yields    [ reducedmodel ] @xmath28    with analytical solution of the reduced model equation ( [ redlinmod ] )    @xmath29    it is obious that it coincides with the general analytical solution of the full model ( [ ansol ] ) where the fast modes @xmath30 have been eliminated a priori and the initial value has been chosen on the manifold defined by the function @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the model ( [ linsys ] ) together with @xmath27 corresponds to the reduced system ( [ reducedmodel ] ) for @xmath31 .",
    "the same arguments hold for the nonlinear davis  skodje test problem ( [ ds ] ) , ( [ ansolds ] ) .",
    "finding a functional with @xmath32 that automatically eliminates the fast modes ( in the case of the two test examples from above a criterion that yields @xmath33 ) without knowing the analytical solution @xmath34 of the underlying ode model equations is the main challenge of trajectory  based model reduction approaches .",
    "the resulting general species reconstruction problem can be formulated as    @xmath35    with ( [ zdp_dyn ] ) describing the kinetic model equations and ( [ zdp_rpv ] ) the fixation of the rpvs at time @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath36 in ( [ zdp_ac ] ) contains possible additional constraints ( for instance chemical element mass conservation relations ) and can be omitted for the two test models above . as mentioned in the introduction , there are plenty of different approaches to find a criterion @xmath37 that ( approximately ) eliminates the fast modes of the system to obtain a poi that identifies the slow modes and thus the sim representing the reduced system .",
    "since all methods share the same objective , there should be some basic concepts underlying , combining , and collecting different approaches .",
    "the focus of this chapter is the discussion of such basic concepts .",
    "the first concept various model reduction approaches make use of time derivatives of the state vector , i.e. @xmath38 containing terms of type @xmath39 in the following , some of these methods are briefly reviewed to be able to place them in a context .",
    "a particular species reconstruction method is discussed in @xcite , which annulates the derivatives of the non rpvs motivating the name zero  derivative principle ( zdp ) .",
    "the zdp can in our above framework be fomulated as    [ zdp ] @xmath40    the poi @xmath26 is intended to lie in a small neighborhood of a sim which is approached with increasing derivative ",
    "order @xmath41 and reached in the limit @xmath42 as it is shown in @xcite .    by the help of the linear model ( [ linsys ] )",
    ", the operation of the zdp can be illustrated .",
    "remember , that elimination of the fast modes characterizes the sim .",
    "considering the general analytical solution of ( [ linsys ] )    [ anasol ] @xmath43    the fast modes of the system are represented by the second term of the sum @xmath44 since it includes the ` fast eigenvalue ' @xmath45 . besides the fixation of the rpv , an additional constraint @xmath46 is needed for obtaining a specified trajectory  ideally leading to the elimination of the fast modes ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is achieved via the zero of the @xmath47 derivative of @xmath48 @xmath49 ( in the limit @xmath42 ) where the corresponding eigenvalues of each mode is taken to the power of @xmath41 . solving the equation @xmath50 for @xmath10 ( @xmath51",
    "is fixed by the fixation of the rpv ) yields @xmath52 with r being independent of @xmath41 . since @xmath53 , @xmath54 for @xmath55 , meaning a decreasing contribution of the fast mode for increasing value of @xmath41 .",
    "the same arguments hold for the nonlinear davis  skodje test model ( [ ds ] ) from @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates fast modes elimination via the zdp approach .",
    "another model reduction method based on derivative  of  the  state  vector  concept is the flow curvature method proposed by ginoux @xcite , comprising a species reconstruction technique that computes a special ( n-1)-dimensional manifold , the flow curvature manifold , which is defined by the location of the points at which the flow curvature vanishes . for an @xmath56-dimensional dynamical system , the zero point of the flow curvature of a trajectory curve",
    "is defined as @xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 . replacing the flow curvature by its successive lie derivatives ( in a two - dimensional system it is defined by the determinant of the first and third time derivatives ) yields successively higher order approximations of the sim ( see @xcite ) . for singularly ",
    "perturbed systems , i.e.  systems comprising a small parameter @xmath60 controlling the time scale separation of the system , the analytical equation of the slow manifold resulting from matched asymptotic expansion in singular perturbation theory @xcite , which is given by a regular perturbation expansion in @xmath61 , equates with the fcm up to a suitable order in @xmath61 . the invariance property of the flow curvature manifold can be shown via the darboux  invariance  theorem  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , maas and pope introduced the widely used idlm method in 1992 @xcite where a local time scale analysis is performed via matrix decomposition of the jacobian of the right hand side of the ode system .",
    "in @xcite , roussel could demonstrate the coincidence between the ildm method and his fet approach .",
    "the operation concept of fet is shown for a planar system    [ fet ] @xmath62    the functional equation @xmath63 is achieved by substituting @xmath64 with @xmath65 into ( [ fet]b ) .",
    "differentiation of the functional equation ( [ fetfe ] ) with respect to @xmath66 yields @xmath67 motivated by the observation that the error in the ildm method is directly related to the neglect of curvature @xcite , which is proportional to @xmath68 here , equation ( [ fet2 ] ) becomes @xmath69 which is called the truncated equation .",
    "thus , we now have two equations ( ( [ fetfe ] ) and ( [ fette ] ) ) in the two unknowns @xmath70 for every @xmath66 allowing the computation of an approximation to the one - dimensional manifold by using an iterative method to solve ( [ fetfe ] ) .",
    "the resulting manifold is called functional equation truncation approximated ( feta ) manifold @xcite .",
    "its approximation of the one - dimensional sim is valid insofar as @xmath68 is small .",
    "already kaper and kaper @xcite pointed out the direct relation between the ildm method and the neglect of the curvature , which is used as a central idea in the above fet approach .",
    "the concept of the zero point of a derivative of the state vector is used here as well .",
    "adrover et al .",
    "@xcite presented a method for model reduction which is based on a geometric characterization of local tangent and normal dynamics .",
    "this description finds its justification in the fact that the flow along a slow manifold is slower than the attraction / repulsion to / from it .",
    "the method uses a ratio @xmath71 of the local stretching ( contraction ) rates of vectors orthogonal to the sim compared to those tangent to the sim .",
    "then this ratio is maximized w.r.t .",
    "again a two - dimensional dynamical system is considered for demonstration @xmath73 possessing a one - dimensional sim @xmath74",
    ". then the stretching ratio @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 being the scalar product , @xmath81 indicating the euclidean norm , and @xmath82 being the jacobian of the right hand side @xmath83 evaluated at @xmath84 .",
    "here , @xmath85 denotes the tangential stretching rate and @xmath86 the normal stretching rate .",
    "the reduction method can be viewed as a local embedding technique : locally projecting the dynamics onto the slowest directions . in the @xmath87dimensional case ( @xmath88 )",
    "the tangential stretching rate is still given by @xmath89 while the definition of normal stretching rates is @xmath90 where the maximum is taken over all vectors @xmath91 belonging to the normal space @xmath92 at @xmath84 .",
    "this value can be computed by the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath93 holds , obviously a derivative  of  the  state  vector  concept is used in this method .      even in the simplest model reduction",
    "approaches qssa @xcite and pea @xcite the idea of taking the zero point of a derivative of species can be found . in the qssa approach",
    "certain species are supposed to be in steady state , meaning the zero point of the first time derivative of these certain species is regarded .",
    "the correlation between the two model reduction methods is analyzed in @xcite , where it is shown that qssa can be interpreted as a limiting case of pea .",
    "in @xcite and follow - up publications of lebiedz et al .",
    "@xcite a species reconstruction method for identifying sims is presented based on a variational principle exploiting trajectory  based optimization    [ op ] @xmath94",
    "@xmath95    the choice of the objective criterion @xmath96 in ( [ op_of ] ) has been discussed in @xcite , @xmath97 has been widely used recently .    solving the optimization problem ( [ op ] ) ,",

    "accordingly , the sim approximation error decreases exponentially with increasing time interval ( @xmath101 fixed ) which is also confirmed by numerical results for realistic chemical combustion processes including thermochemistry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "similar to the stretching  based diagnostics approach by adrover described in chapter ( [ adrover ] ) the optimization criterion ( [ objcrit ] ) @xmath102 contains the second derivative of the state vector @xmath103 .",
