    "hadronic processes can be classified as being either soft or hard , where soft ( hard ) means strong interaction processes with a small ( large ) momentum transfer .",
    "the hard sector is well described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) where the coupling constant ( @xmath0 ) is small ( compare to the hard momentum transfer ) and a perturbative expansion in terms proportional to powers of @xmath0 works .",
    "this is done by means of qcd factorization@xcite@xcite which has been thoroughly tested and taken as the most powerful tool in describing high energy hadronic collisions . on the other hand",
    ", soft processes are characterised by an energy scale of the order of the hadron size ( @xmath1 ) where @xmath0 is large enough to make the higher order terms non - negligible , thus making the soft processes intrinsically non - perturbative . to gain understanding of soft or non - perturbative qcd ,",
    "it is therefore advantageous to first consider soft effects in hard scattering events , since the hard scale gives a firm ground in terms of a parton level process which is calculable in pqcd .",
    "this hard - soft interplay is the basis for the research field of diffractive hard scattering .",
    "encoding the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , one can separate the hard perturbation contributions from the soft non - perturbative ones . following this idea ,",
    "factorization is still being used and has been carefully proved in diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis)@xcite . in the framework of regge factorization , the so called ingelman and schlein ( is ) model@xcite has been largely used in describing hard diffractive events in electron - proton ( ep ) collisions@xcite .",
    "the is model essentially considers that diffractive scattering is attributed to the exchange of a pomeron , i.e. a colorless object with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the pomeron is treated like a real particle , and one considers that a diffractive ep collision is due to an electron - pomeron collision and that a diffractive proton - proton ( pp ) collision is due to a proton - pomeron collision .",
    "however , the nature of the pomeron and its reaction mechanisms are still unknown .",
    "diffractive study may help us understanding more about the qcd pomeron structure .",
    "one should be careful that factorization seems to be broken when going from ddis at hera to hadron - hadron collisions at the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "theoretical studies@xcite predicted that the breakdown of the factorization is due to soft rescattering corrections associated to reinteractions ( referred to as multiple scatterings effects ) between spectator partons of the colliding hadrons that fill in the rapidity gaps related to pomeron exchange .    in order to constrain the modelling of the gap survival effects and",
    "also improve our limited understanding of diffraction , it will be crucial to , in experimental point of view , discriminate the diffractive production from the non - diffractive processes .",
    "indeed , diffractive events can be characterized by having a rapidity gap ( rg ) , say , a region in rapidity or polar angle without any particles .",
    "another definition is to require a leading particle carrying most of the beam particle momentum , which is kinematically related to a rg .",
    "these rgs in the forward or backward rapidity regions , connect directly to the soft part of the events , and therefore non - perturbative effects , on a long space - time scale .",
    "thus , the experimental signature for diffractive production is either the presence of one(two ) rg(s ) in the detector or one(both ) proton(s ) tagged in the final state(s ) .",
    "the potential for using rg vetoes to select diffractive events are highly favoured by the newly installed herschel forward detectors@xcite at lhcb , due to its low instantaneous luminosity and wide rapidity coverage .",
    "similar scintillation counters are also installed at alice@xcite and cms@xcite .",
    "potentially intact proton(s ) tagging to select(or exclude ) exclusive(or diffractive ) events can be realized by using the approved afp@xcite and installed ct - pps@xcite forward proton spectrometers , associated with the atlas and cms central detectors@xcite at the lhc .",
    "the installation of forward detectors at the lhc may provide possibility , somehow open a new window to study new physics at tev scale , whereas diffractive events may serve as one of the most important background source .",
    "besides regge factorization or the amount of gap survival probability which are widely accepted approximations , resonance production , in the central and forward ( proton excitation ) regions , is also an important issue .",
    "related studies can be found , i.e. , in refs@xcite@xcite@xcite . in any case , diffractive productions worth being carefully studied and precisely estimated .",
    "a lot of works on diffraction can be found in the literatures for a long time which include , i.e. , diffractive dijet@xcite , heavy flavour jets@xcite@xcite@xcite , drell - yan pair@xcite , photon@xcite and also diffractive higgs productions@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , etc . in our present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the hard diffractive z boson pair production at the lhc .",
    "diffractive hadroproduction of single electroweak boson was first observed experimentally at the tevatron@xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis were presented in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite at the tevatron , in @xcite at the rhic , and in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite at the lhc .",
    "typically , ref.@xcite show that single diffractive w boson production asymmetry in rapidity is a particularly good observable at the lhc to test the concept of the flavour symmetric pomeron parton distributions and may provide an additional constraint for the pdfs in the proton .",
    "ref.@xcite show that diffractive gauge bosons production can be useful to constrain the modelling of the gap survival effects .",
    "all these referees show that by using gauge boson productions , studies of the pomeron structure and diffraction phenomenology are feasible . for diboson production , diffractive w boson pair is the frontier one which have been studied in refs.@xcite@xcite .",
    "the z boson pair diffractive is less important due to its small production rate compare to w boson pair production .",
    "nevertheless , at the lhc high energy frontier , still worth being studied rather than at the tevatron .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the production mechanisms starting from general production to diffractive ones .",
    "we show the details concerning the parameterization for the diffractive pdfs in the pomeron .",
    "in addition , we present the theoretical estimations for the gap survival probability factor . typically , the forward detector acceptances are considered .",

    "it would be still interesting to check whether the data follow at least the shape of the ratio as a function of @xmath105 as we shown in the future measurements .",
    "the total cross sections ( in unit of pb ) for single diffractive ( sd ) , double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) , photon - photon induced ( @xmath80 ) and non - diffractive ( nd ) z boson pair reactions as a function of proton - proton center - of - mass energy at the 7 , 8 , 13 and 14 tev lhc .",
    "both the detector acceptances of @xmath75 and @xmath74 are considered .",
    "the rapidity gap survival probability factor is not taken into account here . ]    finally in fig.[xsection ] we show the total cross sections ( in unit of pb ) for the single diffractive ( sd ) and double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) cross sections , and compare to the photon - photon induced ( @xmath80 ) as well as non - diffractive ( nd ) z boson pair reactions , as a function of proton - proton cms energy of 7 , 8 , 13 and 14 tev at the lhc .",
    "we use solid , dashed , dotted and dash - dotted curves to present sd , dpe , @xmath80 and nd cross sections , respectively . for sd , dpe and @xmath80 production , both the detector acceptances of @xmath75 ( thin curve ) and @xmath74 ( thick curve ) are considered .",
    "notice here the rapidity gap survival probability factor is not taken into account .",
    "features can been found in the figures are list as the following :    * the cross sections for different production mechanisms increase linearly as functions of the colliding energy . *",
    "typical size order is normally @xmath106 as excepted . * results from considering atlas - afp detector acceptance ( @xmath74 )",
    "are comparable with that from totem - cms ( @xmath75 ) but a little smaller .",
    "when the rapidity gap survival probability factor is considered , we can find that the sd cross section is at the order of @xmath107 .",
    "for the dpe production rate is about @xmath108 which is small but still larger than that of @xmath80 induced production which is only about 0.1 fb .",
    "the smallness of the z boson pair production , however , is not a thoroughly bad thing .",
    "as we said , when go to lhc energy frontier , exclusive production may open a new window to new physics searching@xcite@xcite while in this case diffractive may serve as the important background .",
    "if a new sector is produced through gauge z boson pair production , such mechanism can be tested with a typical clean environment .",
    "a rich program at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is being pursued in diffractive physics by all collaborations either based on the identification of large rapidity gaps or by using dedicated proton spectrometers . in our present study",
    ", we perform the calculation from phenomenological analysis of z boson pair hard diffractive production at the lhc . our calculation is based on the regge factorization approach .",
    "diffractive parton density functions ( dpdfs ) extracted by the h1 collaboration at desy - hera are used and uncertainties by using different fits in the dpdfs are discussed .",
    "the multiple pomeron exchange corrections are considered through the rapidity gap survival probability factor .",
    "we display various kinematical distributions for both the single diffractive(sd ) and double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) productions .",
    "we give also numerical predictions for their cross sections and compare with the photon - induced and non - diffractive ones .",
    "the contributions from both quark - anti - quark collision and gluon - gluon fusion modes are displayed and compared .",
    "we define the appropriate ratios of diffractive over non - diffractive ( nd ) productions , by using which predictions affected by theoretical errors associated with scale variations can be reduced .",
    "typically the single diffractive ratio is varies between @xmath101 and @xmath102 while the double pomeron exchange ratio varies in the range @xmath104 for 7,8 ( 13 , 14 ) tev .",
    "we make predictions which could be compared to future measurements at the lhc where forward proton detectors are installed and detector acceptances are considered .",
