    "strong evidences for a solution of the longstanding problem on the ratio @xmath1 between the widths for the weak processes @xmath11 and @xmath12 originated from theoretical analyses @xcite of kek nucleon coincidence data @xcite . in the authors opinion , this puzzle was due to the non  trivial interpretation of experimental data , which required a careful analysis of nuclear medium effects on the weak decay nucleons , rather than to a poor understanding of the weak decay mechanism .",
    "indeed , the lately extracted @xmath1 values @xcite turned out to be in agreement with the previous , pure theoretical estimates of refs .",
    "@xcite obtained by using one  meson  exchange potentials to describe the one  nucleon induced , @xmath2 weak transitions .",
    "nevertheless , further theoretical and experimental work is desirable in order to confirm the previously mentioned evidence in favor of a solution of the @xmath1 puzzle .",
    "indeed , on the one hand such an evidence relies on particular theoretical descriptions of both the weak decay mechanism and the subsequent propagation of the produced nucleons within the residual nucleus . in this direction ,",
    "the use of alternative weak decay or / and intranuclear cascade models is of interest . on the other hand , one has to consider that another problem of the field is still unsolved : it concerns the asymmetry of the protons emitted in the non  mesonic decay of polarized hypernuclei , measured to be not far from zero in recent experiments @xcite while a large negative number is predicted by the theoretical models@xcite .",
    "recently , a strong effect of nucleon final state interactions ( fsi ) was pointed out @xcite without , however , bringing new hints for a possible solution of the asymmetry puzzle . the connections existing among the weak decay observables [ @xmath1 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the width for two ",

    "very recent measurements of single @xcite and double  coincidence @xcite nucleon spectra from the non  mesonic hypernuclear decay were reported with accuracies largely improved with respect to the ones at disposal in previous experiments @xcite in forms that suggest suitable comparisons with theory .",
    "some of these experiments have somehow managed to derive values of @xmath1 .",
    "they are discussed in the following paragraphs .",
    "the @xmath1 ratio was obtained by kek ",

    "was obtained @xcite by neglecting the two  nucleon induced decay mechanism ( for @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ) . as the very same authors of refs .",
    "@xcite noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , these determinations of the ratio may be affected by the fact that in the experiment the neutron  induced decay width was estimated indirectly , from the proton measurement , using the relation @xmath22 , which neglects two  nucleon stimulated non  mesonic decays .",
    "this method also required the measurement of the total decay width @xmath23 as well as the decay rates for the mesonic channels @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , for which previous data from ref .",
    "@xcite were used in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , the severe energy losses suffered by protons inside the ( thick ) target and detector materials and the consequently high kinetic energy threshold ( about @xmath28 mev ) for proton detection in kek",
    " e307 did not permit an easy reconstruction of the proton spectrum emitted by the nucleus , which is essential for the indirect evaluation of @xmath29 .",
    "theoretical input about nucleon rescattering in the residual nucleus @xcite was indeed necessary to supply to this problem .",
    "as a consequence , in ref .  @xcite the hypothesis was advanced that @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) might be overestimated ( underestimated ) in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite because of an underestimation in the number of emitted protons .    a controversial determination of the ratio from kek  e369 data , based on non - demonstrated , delicate hypotheses and theoretical input ( again from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this experiment ,",

    "however , one has to note that the previous approximate relation between @xmath1 and @xmath39 is only valid when fsi and two  nucleon induced decay effects can be neglected .",
    "the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite and the results presented in sections [ single ] and [ subsec : np ] prove that fsi are not negligible even when a high detection threshold such as @xmath40 mev is used .",
    "in the experiments kek  e462 ( @xmath34he ) and kek ",
    "e508 ( @xmath7c ) , nucleon ",
    "nucleon coincidence spectra were also measured @xcite .",
    "quite clean angular and energy correlations between neutron  neutron and neutron  proton emitted pairs ( i.e. , back  to  back kinematics and @xmath41 mev ) were observed , thus representing the first direct experimental evidence of the existence of the two  body decays @xmath11 and @xmath42 .",
    "the ratio , @xmath43 , between the numbers of emitted neutron  neutron and neutron  proton pairs was measured to be around @xmath44 for both @xmath34he and @xmath7c after applying the angular and energy restrictions : @xmath45 and @xmath46 mev .",

    "@xcite concluded that , under these constraints , @xmath47 on the basis of a supposed cancellation of fsi and two  nucleon stimulated decays effects . in a very recent work @xcite ,",
    "the result @xmath48 was deduced by the kek collaboration for @xmath7c after correcting for fsi effects by making use of the number of detected proton  proton pairs in addition to measurements of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . a rather schematic method , not completely reliable in our opinion , quite in line with the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , was applied to determine @xmath1 .",
    "we shall discuss the effect of fsi and two  nucleon induced decays in the extraction of @xmath1 from measurements of @xmath43 in section [ subsec : nnnp ] .    despite this recent experimental progress , improved and/or independent measurements are awaited for a really complete understanding of the @xmath2 reaction in nuclei . on this respect ,",
    "the observation of the weak decay of neutron and proton rich hypernuclei @xcite would also be source of new information .    on the theoretical side , refs .",
    "@xcite presented an extensive study of single and double  coincidence nucleon spectra for the non  mesonic decay of @xmath34he and @xmath7c hypernuclei .",
    "a one  meson  exchange ( ome ) model was used for the @xmath2 transition in a finite nucleus framework .",
    "the two  nucleon induced decay channel @xmath51 was taken into account via the polarization propagator method in the local density approximation of refs .",
    "the intranuclear cascade code of ref .",
    "@xcite was used to simulate the nucleon propagation inside the residual nucleus .",
    "comparison with kek  e462 and kek ",
    "e508 coincidence data @xcite lead to the determination of @xmath1 values around 0.3 - 0.4 for both @xmath34he and @xmath7c .",
    "the relationship between @xmath1 and the observable ratio between neutron  neutron and neutron  proton pairs , @xmath43 , was established for the first time in ref .",
    "it was shown that fsi and two  nucleon induced decays significantly affect the extraction of @xmath1 from coincidence data even when favorable energy and angular correlation restrictions are imposed on the observed nucleon pairs .",
    "coincidence measurements of course make the determination of @xmath1 easier and cleaner , since fsi and two  nucleon induced decay effects are reduced with respect to the ones emerging in analyses of single nucleon observables such as @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , contrary to what claimed in refs .",
    "@xcite , they do not permit an exclusive identification of the non  mesonic decay channels as neutron and proton  induced .",
    "thus , @xmath52 ( see figures 11 and 12 of ref .",
    "@xcite and the present discussion in section [ subsec : nnnp ] ) , indicating that to determine @xmath1 one has to rely on experimental as well as theoretical coincidence spectra .",
    "with the purpose of making the extraction of @xmath1 less model dependent , in the present paper we make use of an alternative framework for hypernuclear decay : it consists of a nuclear matter formalism @xcite extended to finite nuclei via the local density approximation , with the same weak ome transition potential ( containing @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 exchange ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition to the monte carlo intranuclear cascade code of ref .  @xcite . at variance with previous analyses , in the present paper",
    "we follow a microscopic approach for the two  nucleon induced decay , also including the channels @xmath59 and @xmath5 besides the standard mode @xmath51 .",
    "most of the results shown are for the intermediate",
    " mass hypernucleus @xmath7c , but we also present some results for a heavier hypernucleus , @xmath32y .",
    "both cases can be well described within a local density approximation .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the weak decay models employed in the calculation are outlined in section  [ weakdecay ] . in section  [ inc ]",
    "we give a few details of the intranuclear cascade simulation .",
    "numerical results for single and double coincidence nucleon distributions are presented and compared with data in section  [ results ] .",
    "the contribution of the two  nucleon induced decay channels is analyzed with special regard .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the weak decay transitions as well as the distributions of the weak decay nucleons are obtained by means of a many  body description of the @xmath0 self  energy in nuclear matter , based on the polarization propagator method ( ppm ) originally proposed by oset and salcedo @xcite .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) is employed to extend the calculation to finite nuclei .",
    "this approach was previously established @xcite to evaluate the non  mesonic decay widths of @xmath7c .",
    "there is a major value of this model which by itself adds sufficient novelty to the present work with respect to previous analyses @xcite of the nucleon spectra from hypernuclear non  mesonic decay .",
    "we must indeed emphasize that the present approach is more microscopic ( i.e. , less phenomenological ) than the previous ones . indeed , in addition to the generally considered @xmath51 channel , also the @xmath59 and @xmath60 mechanisms are now evaluated .",
    "the present approach is then more in line with the functional approach in the framework of the bosonic loop expansion used in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the difference that a clear separation into one and two  nucleon induced channels is now possible .",
    "we start with a brief summary concerning the evaluation of the one  nucleon ( @xmath61 ) induced decay widths @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "details can be found in refs .",
    "it is convenient to work first with the partial decay width @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the @xmath0 energy ",
    "momentum , @xmath64 is the fermi momentum of nuclear matter and the @xmath65 s represent the isospin projections of the baryons . using the standard goldstone rules for diagrams in nuclear matter , it is straightforward to write for the partial decay width : @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) stands for the energy  momentum of particles ( holes ) .",
    "the meaning of each @xmath67 and @xmath68 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figme1 ] , where we have drawn the @xmath0 self  energy diagrams from which the relevant transition amplitude is obtained . from the energy  momentum conservation in each vertex we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath71 represents the spin and isospin projections of particle  @xmath72 .",
    "the one  meson  exchange weak transition potential , @xmath73 , takes into account the complete pseudoscalar and vector meson octets ( @xmath74 ) through the parameterization of ref .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ gamdirexc ] ) runs over all spins and isospins of the weak transition potential .",
    "note that the first term in the _ r.h.s .",
    "_  of this equation is the usually called direct contribution , while the second one is the exchange term .    the particle and hole propagators are , respectively : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the nucleon total free energy and @xmath77 the nucleon binding energy .    by integrating eq",
    "( [ gamdirexc ] ) over @xmath78 one obtains the @xmath64dependent width : @xmath79 where for the @xmath0 wave  function , @xmath80 , we take the @xmath81 wave  function of a harmonic oscillator and the @xmath0 energy , @xmath82 , is taken as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the experimental @xmath0 binding energy . to evaluate the decay width for a particular nucleus , one uses either an effective fermi momentum or the lda @xcite . in the last case",
    ", @xmath64 is spatially dependent and the transition rate reads @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the fourier transform of @xmath80 .",
    "finally , by summing up over the isospin of baryons one obtains : @xmath87 and the @xmath61induced decay width is : @xmath88 we have to stress that exchange terms are very important for an accurate evaluation of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the present work calculates exactly the exchange terms in nuclear matter .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) corrections have not been taken into account , because a precise evaluation of rpa  exchange terms is a rather involved task , which goes beyond the scope of the present contribution .    at this point",
    "we have to mention that the models of refs .",
    "@xcite have been recently improved . on the one hand , a more realistic @xmath0 wave ",
    "function , obtained in terms of the experimental hyperon binding energy , has been considered in the lda calculation of refs .",
    "@xcite , leading to a reduction of about 25% on the @xmath61induced decay rates , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and of 30 - 40% on the @xmath90induced ones , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , with respect to the original results . on the other hand ,",
    "a numerically more accurate evaluation of the distorted final state wave  functions has been implemented in the finite nucleus approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and the rates increase by about 15% . in both cases",
    "the ratio @xmath1 is essentially left unchanged .",
    "the updated predictions , used in the present work , are given in table  [ gammas ] .",
    "fortunately , the spectra discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , being normalized per non  mesonic weak decay , are not affected by the corrections of ref .",
    "note that the non  mesonic rate @xmath94 of the finite nucleus calculation is underestimated by about 25% because it lacks the contribution of the @xmath90stimulated mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "the lda result is overestimated because two  body final state interactions between the emitted nucleons were not considered . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the omission of this effect leads to rates larger by as much as a factor of two .",
    "however , this factor disappears in the normalized spectra discussed in the present work and used for the important purpose of extracting @xmath1 from measured distributions .",
    ".non  mesonic weak decay rates ( in units of the free @xmath0 decay width ) predicted for @xmath7c by the updated finite nucleus approach ( omea and omef calculations ) of ref .",
    "@xcite and lda model of refs .",
    "@xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we want to note that for the case with @xmath95 , kim et al .",
    "@xcite have recently extracted a ratio @xmath48 by employing the number of detected proton  proton pairs in addition to the measurement of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . a schematic method for accounting for fsi effects , similar to the one employed in ref .",
    "@xcite for single ",
    "nucleon observables , was adopted for this purpose .",
    "in addition , @xmath90stimulated decay channels were neglected . the discrepancy between this kek determination and our detailed prediction of table  [ datann ] for @xmath96 ( compare especially the central values )",
    "demonstrate that analyses of data such as those of refs .",
    "@xcite show certain limitations .",
    "we have presented a study of single and double  coincidence nucleon spectra for the non  mesonic weak decay of @xmath0hypernuclei .",
    "one  meson  exchange models have been used to describe one and two  nucleon induced decay processes , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in a nuclear matter framework which has been adapted for finite nuclei predictions via the local density approximation . besides , an intranuclear cascade code based on monte carlo techniques has simulated the final state interactions of the outgoing nucleons with the residual nucleus .    unlike previous papers ,",
    "here we have adopted a microscopic approach for describing the two  nucleon induced decay , which included the channels @xmath4 and @xmath60 in addition to the mode @xmath6 already considered in previous phenomenological studies .",
    "the use of a different theoretical approach for calculation meets our main purpose of making the extraction of the ratio @xmath1 from data less model dependent .",
    "the results have been compared with previous finite nucleus analyses @xcite , with special consideration for the two  nucleon induced decay mechanism , and with a considerable amount of recent data by kek @xcite . apart from some difference ascribable to the phase space dependence and to the different weak decay models adopted for the two  nucleon induced decay channels , the present predictions for the observable ratios @xmath39 and @xmath43 confirm the finite nucleus results .    the single  neutron spectra for @xmath7c and @xmath32y measured by kek ",
    "e369 and kek ",
    "e508 have been reproduced with reasonable accuracy . on the contrary , the kek ",
    "e508 single  proton spectrum for @xmath7c is in strong disagreement with our prediction .",
    "the theoretical distribution would reproduce these data only by enforcing artificially large values for @xmath1 , which , in turn , would lead to a serious overestimation of the mentioned single  neutron spectra . as a consequence of that , through the weak interaction model independent analysis of @xmath39 data for @xmath7c we determined @xmath97 , a value that largely overestimates pure theoretical predictions ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 .",
    "the contribution of the two  nucleon induced decay channels in these analyses turn out to be of moderate size when high nucleon kinetic energy cuts such as 60 mev are imposed . on the contrary ,",
    "fsi effects reveal to be of great importance when determining @xmath1 from single  nucleon data .",
    "a demonstration of that is the inapplicability of the relation @xmath98 , which neglects fsi and two  nucleon stimulated decay effects , sometimes used in experimental analyses .",
    "even the naf model of fsi proposed by kim et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite is far from being supported by a detailed calculation .",
    "concerning nucleon ",
    "nucleon correlation observables , while there is fair agreement among our predictions and data in the case of @xmath49 , we overestimate the observations in the case of @xmath50 .",
    "the origin of such a difference is likely the same as the one responsible for the mentioned disagreement on the single ",
    "proton spectra .",
    "another indication supporting this possibility comes from the fact that we also overestimate the experimental distributions for @xmath99 .",
    "we have thus advanced the hypothesis that the experiment could have systematically underestimated the number of protons emitted in @xmath7c decay , thus leading to the underestimation of @xmath37 , @xmath50 and @xmath99 spectra . on the contrary , for the observables involving only neutron detection , @xmath36 and @xmath49 , theory and experiment turn out to agree .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn in terms of the finite nucleus results .",
    "a clarification of the mentioned eventuality is desirable for an accurate determination of the @xmath1 ratio .",
    "indeed , in this paper as well as in previous ones @xcite , @xmath1 has been determined from data on @xmath43 . here , for @xmath7c",
    "we have obtained @xmath8 , whose central value could be lowered to about 0.3 if the measured neutron ",
    "proton distributions resembled those of our evaluations .",
    "the conclusion remains the same by using the finite nucleus analysis .",
    "the effect of the two  nucleon induced decay modes on the extracted @xmath1 turn out to be small due to the restrictions imposed on angular and energy correlations . in any case , one has to bear in mind that ratios in the interval 0.3 - 0.5 would be compatible with most of today s pure theoretical evaluations , which are also affected by uncertainties , especially due to the degree of arbitrariness in the experimentally unknown baryon couplings .",
    "these models can also reproduce the observed total non  mesonic decay rates .    before concluding , we want to make a brief comment on the two  nucleon induced mode . because of the small or anyhow moderate dependence of the determined @xmath1 values on these decay channels , triple coincidence measurements reveal to be necessary for the purpose of disentangling one and two  nucleon stimulated decays in observed events . to summarize , while we can safely assert that analyses of correlation measurements definitely solve the longstanding puzzle on the ratio @xmath1 , single ",
    "nucleon spectra studies still provide ratios which are incompatible with what is obtained from pure theoretical models .",
    "we hope it will be possible to clarify soon the reasons of such a discrepancy .",
