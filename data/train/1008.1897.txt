    "absorption , photoluminescence , and raman scattering are standard spectroscopy methods to reveal optical properties of nanoscale objects.@xcite in particular , they have been applied to characterize carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) of different chiral angle , diameter , and family.@xcite in 2004 , sfeir at al.@xcite introduced rayleigh scattering as an additional powerful technique for identifying the optical finger print of individual single - walled cnts .",
    "it allows the investigation of optical properties of _ individual _ cnts , since the weak scattering signal is much easier to measure than e.g. the change in intensity due to the absorption . in combination with electron diffraction data ,",
    "rayleigh scattering spectroscopy has successfully been applied to determine the electronic structure of individual cnts , in particular the predicted peak splitting in metallic tubes due to the trigonal warping effect@xcite was proven experimentally.@xcite    recently , excitonic effects in metallic nanotubes have been experimentally proved by measuring their rayleigh spectra.@xcite despite the large screening , metallic nanotubes were shown to exhibit binding energies around @xmath3{mev}$ ] , which is small comparing to semiconducting nanotubes,@xcite but still larger than the thermal energy at room temperature .",
    "the experimental data on excitonic rayleigh scattering spectra has not yet been complemented by theoretical studies . in refs .",
    "we studied free - particle rayleigh scattering spectra of metallic and semiconducting cnts showing characteristic features in rayleigh scattering spectra , which distinguish them from corresponding absorption spectra . in this work",
    ", we address the question on how the formation of coulomb - bound electron - hole pairs , i.e. excitons , influences these features .",
    "we perform investigations on ( i ) the excitonic transition and excitonic binding energy , ( ii ) the trigonal warping splitting as a function of the diameter and the chiral angle , ( iii ) the relative oscillator strength in the double - peaked spectra of metallic nanotubes , and ( iv ) the peak shape in rayleigh spectra of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes .",
    "finally , we compare our results with recent experimental data.@xcite",
    "in our calculations , the rayleigh scattering cross section is considered for incident light polarized along the nanotube axis accounting for the depolarization effect that strongly suppresses light polarized perpendicular to the nanotube axis.@xcite here , we briefly summarize the derivation of the rayleigh scattering cross section : nanotubes are regarded as long cylinders with diameters small compared to the wavelength of light . starting from maxwell equations , the expression for @xmath4 can be derived by solving the scalar wave equation in cylindrical coordinates,@xcite and exploiting the limit of small nanotube radii .",
    "the scattering cross section is given by the ratio of the rate @xmath5 at which energy passes through the scattering surface @xmath6 and the incident irradiance .",
    "the rate @xmath7 is determined by the radial component of the poynting vector of the scattered field @xmath8 $ ] . by introducing vector cylindrical harmonics@xcite @xmath9 and @xmath10 with a scalar function @xmath11 ,",
    "the wave number @xmath12 , and the unit vector @xmath13 parallel to the cylinder axis the problem can be simplified , since these functions satisfy both the vectorial and the scalar wave equation .",
    "once they are calculated , the electric and magnetic field @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be expanded in @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the scalar function @xmath11 is called a generating function for the vector harmonics @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "its choice depends on the investigated system , its symmetries and boundary conditions . for rayleigh scattering from a cylinder",
    ", the scalar function has to satisfy the wave equation in cylindrical polar coordinates .",
    "an ansatz for the solution is @xmath18 with @xmath19 as bessel functions of first and second kind of integral order @xmath20 and with @xmath21 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath22 satisfies the boundary conditions between the cylinder and the surrounding medium . within the limit of small particles ,",
    "i.e. for cylinders with a diameter much smaller than the wavelength of light ( @xmath23 with @xmath24 as the wave vector of light and @xmath25 as the radius of the cylinder ) , the scattering cross section @xmath4 per unit length can be expressed via the linear susceptibility @xmath26 as @xmath27 the speed of light .",
    "in contrast to the scattering from a sphere , the cross section is proportional to @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 .",
    "this can be traced back to the scattered field @xmath30 , which is given asymptotically by @xmath31 far away from a cylinder , while for a sphere it is @xmath32 .",
    "the strength of the rayleigh scattering is determined by the square of the absolute value of the optical susceptibility @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast to the absorption coefficient@xcite @xmath33 , rayleigh scattering has also a contribution from the real part of @xmath26 and , hence , includes the influence of the resonant refractive index @xmath34 of optical transitions .",
    "this leads to important differences in the characteristics of rayleigh and absorption spectra , which are discussed below .",
    "to obtain the rayleigh scattering cross section , we need the optical susceptibility @xmath26 , which is the linear response function of the perturbed system . within the @xmath35 approach for the light - matter interaction , it reads@xcite @xmath36 with the externally driven current density @xmath37 and the vector potential @xmath38 .",
    "the current density depends on the fourier transform of the microscopic polarization @xmath39 and the optical matrix element @xmath40 along the nanotube axis ( here , z - axis)@xcite @xmath41 the microscopic polarization @xmath42 is a measure for the transition probability between the two states @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 stand for the band index and @xmath24 for the wave vector .",

    "in particular , these curvature effects have been shown to significantly contribute to the wide family spread in kataura plots.@xcite furthermore , the nearest - neighbor tight - binding approach is known to be a good approximation for transitions close to the @xmath76 point , whereas it is often insufficient to model peak positions at higher energies . however , in our work we focus on characteristic peak shapes and relative peak intensities in rayleigh scattering spectra for metallic and semiconducting nanotubes , where we expect hybridization effects to play a minor role .",

    "trigonal warping describes the deviation of the equi - energy contours from circles in the brillouin zone of graphene around the @xmath76 point.@xcite due to its trigonal shape , an energy splitting of van - hove singularities stemming from different sides with respect to the @xmath76 point appears .",
    "this strongly depends on the orientation of the triangle : the splitting is maximal for nanotubes with a small chiral angle and it vanishes for armchair tubes .",
    "furthermore , the higher the transition energy , the larger is the trigonal warping effect , since the deviation from circles is larger .",
    "figure [ trig ] shows the peak splitting @xmath105 as a function of the chiral angle and the diameter for metallic nanotubes for both the excitonic and the free - particle picture .",
    "first , we observe that excitons do not influence the trigonal warping induced splitting .",

    "the lower - lying transitions within the double - peaked structure of rayleigh scattering spectra show a higher oscillator strength independently of the chiral angle and diameter , i.e. @xmath0 is always higher in intensity than @xmath99 .",
    "the intensity ratio @xmath113 increases with decreasing chiral angle . in the limiting case of armchair nanotubes ,",
    "the ratio is exactly 1 due to vanishing splitting .",
    "the described behavior of peak intensity ratios is not significantly influenced by excitons .",
    "the relative intensities can be explained by the different behavior of the optical matrix element @xmath114 entering in @xmath80 along the two high - symmetry lines @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the graphene bz.@xcite the carrier - field interaction turns out to be higher on the @xmath116 side , cp .",

    ", the lower - lying transitions in the double - peaked structure stemming from the @xmath116 side@xcite are amplified .",
    "following this argumentation , the intensity ratio should increase with the order of transition .",
    "however , the dependence of the scattering cross section @xmath4 on @xmath28 cancels this effect , since the energetically higher transition @xmath99 is enhanced with respect to @xmath0 resulting in a decrease of the intensity ratio .",
    "another interesting observation is the inverse intensity ratio @xmath117 in absorption spectra , cp .",
    "[ exc - el]a ) . this can be ascribed to the overlap of the @xmath99 peak with the van - hove singularity associated with @xmath0 .",

    "the overlap with the continuum is smaller , since here the continuum is not characterized by a van hove singularity . as a result , the intensity ratio @xmath118 remains larger than 1 - as expected from the family behavior of the optical matrix element .",

    "rayleigh peaks are shown to be asymmetric towards lower energies reflecting an enhanced cross section @xmath4 at the lower - energy wing , cp .",
    "[ ray ] . this can be traced back to the refractive part of the optical susceptibility . the latter exhibits a long tail on the low energy side of each transition , which adds up with the resonant response leading to the observed asymmetry .",

    "furthermore , we observe an interesting feature on the high - energy side of metallic nanotubes . here , two effects are competing : on the one side , the spectrally decaying refractive index leads to a reduction of the scattering cross section . on the other hand , due to the small binding energies",
    "there is an overlap between the excitonic transition and the continuum lifting up the intensity . as a result ,",
    "the overall reduction is much smaller compared to semiconducting nanotubes , where the excitonic binding energy is large and the overlap with the continuum is negligibly small .    for comparison , fig .",
    "[ abs ] shows the peak shape in excitonic and free - particle absorption spectra for the same exemplary metallic and semiconducting nanotube as in fig .",

    "there is no interference with the refractive part of the response function resulting in narrow peaks with a width of determined by the parameter @xmath119 entering eq.bloch1 .",
    "note that the peak shape of metallic nanotubes exhibits a higher - energy shoulder due to the small excitonic binding energies and the resulting overlap with the continuum.@xcite      figure [ exp - th ] illustrates the good agreement of theoretical and experimental rayleigh scattering spectra for two exemplary metallic tubes . including excitonic effects",
