    "it is not a matter of debate now whether the universe is accelerating at the present epoch since it is strongly supported by various astronomical probes of complementary nature such as type ia supernovae data ( sn ia)@xcite , galaxy redshift surveys @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) data @xcite and large scale structure @xcite . observations also suggest that there had been a transition of the universe from the earlier deceleration phase to the recent acceleration phase @xcite .",
    "we do not have a fundamental understanding of the root cause of the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "we label our ignorance with the term  dark energy \" ( de ) , which is assumed to permeate all of space and increase the rate of expansion of the universe @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusion of de into the prevailing theory of cosmology has been enormously successful in resolving numerous puzzles that plagued this field for many years .",
    "for example , with prior cosmological models , the universe appeared to be younger than its oldest stars .",
    "when de is included in the model , the problem goes away .",
    "the most recent cmb observations indicate that de accounts for around three fourth of the total mass energy of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of de is still unknown and various cosmological probes on theoretical and experimental fronts are in progress to resolve this problem .",
    "the simplest candidate for the de is the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) or vacuum energy since it fits the observational data well . during the cosmological evolution ,",
    "the cosmological constant has the constant energy density and pressure with the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath1 .",
    "however , one has the reason to dislike the cosmological constant since it suffers from the theoretical problems such as the  fine - tuning \" and  cosmic coincidence \" puzzles @xcite .",
    "consequently , the dynamic de models have been studied frequently in the literature .",
    "for instance , the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization of the eos parameter of de , which was first introduced in @xcite , has been frequently constrained with observational data in order to study the nature of dynamic de ( see @xcite for recent constraints from planck ) .",
    "the @xmath0cdm ( cosmological constant + cold dark matter ) model , which is the standard model in modern cosmology , has been remarkably successful to describe the universe on large scales",
    ". however , it faces persistent challenges from observations on small scales that probe the innermost regions of dark matter halos and the properties of the milky way s dwarf galaxy satellites .",
    "see @xcite for reviews on the recent observational and theoretical status of these  small scale controversies \" . in this regard ,",
    "the warm dark matter ( wdm ) is a plausible dark matter paradigm , which seems to solve many of small scale discrepancies while being indistinguishable from cdm on larger scales . in particle physics ,",
    "the kev scale sterile neutrinos are believed to account for wdm . on the other hand ,",
    "the fluid perspective of wdm has been investigated in many studies . in @xcite",
    ", the bounds on eos of dm were investigated using cmb , sn ia and large scale structure data in the cases of no entropy production and vanishing adiabatic sound speed . in @xcite ,",
    "a simple method was suggested for measuring the eos parameter of dm that combines kinematic and gravitational lensing data to test the widely adopted assumption of pressureless dm . following the method",
    ", the authors in @xcite found that the value of the eos parameter of dm is consistent with pressureless dm within the errors .",
    "the authors of @xcite investigated the  warmness \" of the dm fluid constraining cosmological models with constant eos parameters of dm and de by considering non - interacting and interacting scenarios of dm and de .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered various cosmological models consisting of only dm and de components by assuming constant and variable eos parameters of the two components .",
    "they found observational constraints on these models using sn ia , cmb and bao data , and concluded that wdm models are not favored over the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the authors in @xcite investigated the bounds on eos parameter of dm using wmap 5 year data and cmb + sdss + snls data in a cosmological model based on spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker space - time filled with ordinary matter ( baryonic ) and radiation , de component acting as a cosmological constant and dm component with constant eos parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the friedmann equation in this model reads as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is scale factor in terms of the redshift @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is hubble constant and @xmath7 is density parameter for the @xmath8th component .",
    "the authors in @xcite stressed that in model , the background evolution is completely determined by the eos of dm , and investigated the properties of dm by studying the behavior on its perturbations . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the model is constrained with the currently available observational data . in this work ,",
    "the tighter constraints are obtained on the eos parameter of dm due to high quality of observational data .",
    "it may be noted that in the studies @xcite , the dm is characterized by a constant eos parameter @xmath2 and the de candidate is the cosmological constant with constant eos parameter @xmath9 .",
    "however , the choice of constant eos parameter for dm is too restrictive @xcite .",
    "similarly , candidature of cosmological constant for de is not satisfactory as discussed earlier .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we consider the naturally motivated cpl parametrizations for the eos parameters of dm and de @xcite , respectively , given by @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants .    with these cpl forms of eos of dm and de ,",
    "the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18    it is easy to see that the model is retrieved from the model in the particular case @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the present study , we consider the generalized model and study the constraints on variable eos parameters of dm and de by using the currently available observational data from snls3 , bao and _ planck_+wmap9+wigglez measurements of matter power spectrum .",
    "one may observe the strong degeneracy in the background evolution of the dm and de components .",
    "we shall deal with this issue later .",
    "next , we assume that dm component interacts with other components only gravitationally .",
    "since dm is believed to be responsible for the gravitational instability and structure formation in the universe , we consider the perturbations and study the behavior of dm by observing its effects on cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "thus , the main objectives of this study include ( i ) constraining the cpl eos parameters of dm and de with the latest observational data ( ii ) testing the warmness of dm ( iii ) testing the behavior of dm by observing its effects on cmb and matter power spectra through perturbations .",
    "for a perfect fluid , one has the following perturbation equations for density contrast and velocity divergence in the synchronous gauge    @xmath21,\\label{eq : idelta}\\\\ \\dot{\\theta}_{i}&=&-\\mathcal{h}(1 - 3c^2_{s , eff})\\theta_{i}+\\frac{c^2_{s , eff}}{1+w_{i}}k^2\\delta_{i}-k^2\\sigma_{i}\\label{eq : iv } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    following the notations of @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we have used the following definition of the adiabatic sound speed @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the effective sound speed in the rest frame of the @xmath8th fluid . in general",
    ", @xmath23 is a free model parameter , which measures the entropy perturbations through its difference to the adiabatic sound speed , i.e. , the relation @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 gives a gauge - invariant form for the entropy perturbations . with these definitions ,",
    "the microscale properties of the energy component are characterized by three quantities , i.e. , the eos parameters @xmath26 , the effective sound speed @xmath23 and the shear perturbation @xmath27 . in this work , we assume zero shear perturbations for the dm and de . since the dm is responsible for the formation of the large scale structure in our universe , we fix the effective speed of sound @xmath28 for dm in this work .",
    "we used the observational data points from snls3 , bao and _ planck_+wmap9+wigglez measurements of matter power spectrum to perform a global fitting to the model parameter space @xmath29\\}\\nonumber\\ ] ] via the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we modified the publicly available * cosmomc * package @xcite to include the perturbation evolutions of dm and de in accordance with the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : idelta ] ) and ( [ eq : iv ] ) . from the friedmann equation",
    ", one can see that the cpl like dm and de are degenerated strongly , and through the background evolution information , one can not distinguish the two components .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain tight constraints , one should break this degeneracy by hand , and keep the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the range of @xmath30 .",
    "however , negative values of @xmath12 are also allowed and discussed in some earlier studies @xcite . after assuming the suitable priors on various model parameters ( see table [ tab : results ] ) , we ran the code on the _ computing cluster for cosmos _ in eight chains . and",
    "it was stopped when the gelman & rubin @xmath31 parameter reached the value @xmath32 .",
    "it guarantees the accurate confidence limits .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab : results ] .",
    ".the mean values with @xmath33 errors and the best fit values of model parameters , where snls3 , bao , _ planck_+wmap9+wigglez measurements of matter power spectrum are used . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure [ fig : wigglecontour ] , we show one - dimensional marginalized distribution of individual parameters and two - dimensional contours with @xmath34 c.l . and @xmath35 c.l . for the model parameters under consideration .",
    "c.l . and @xmath35 c.l.,width=321 ]",
    "using the observational constraint results displayed in table [ tab : results ] , we now analyze the effects of model parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 on the cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "we fix the other relevant model parameters to their mean values as given in table [ tab : results ] and vary one of these two model parameters around its mean value .",
    "the effects to the cmb tt power spectrum are shown in figure [ fig : cls ] .",
    "we see that the positive values of model parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 will decrease the equality time of matter and radiation when the other relevant cosmological model parameters are fixed . consequently",
    ", the amplitudes of the peaks of the cmb are depressed and the positions of the peaks are moved to the right side . on the large scale",
    "where @xmath36 , the curves are increased when the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive due to the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .     and",
    "@xmath13 to the cmb tt power spectrum for different values of the model parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the other relevant model parameters are fixed to their mean values as shown in table [ tab : results].,width=359 ]    their effects on the matter power spectrum are shown in figure [ fig : mp ] , where the redshift is fixed to @xmath37 .",
    "the effects of model parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 to the matter power spectrum are similar to the ones as analyzed in ref .",
    "the positive values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 move the matter and radiation equality to earlier times and increase the matter power spectrum .      from table [",
    "tab : results ] , we see that the 1@xmath38 constraints on @xmath12 are @xmath39 , which are tighter in comparison to the constraints obtained in the recent studies @xcite . also , the gradual shift of the values of @xmath12 towards 0 with the advanced and improved observational data shows that the current / future observations are likely to favor the cdm scenario over the wdm .",
    "similarly , the constraints on @xmath14 are @xmath40 .",
    "also , the best fit value of @xmath14 is @xmath41 .",
    "thus , current observational data favor cosmological constant type of de . finally , we conclude that the @xmath0cdm scenario is favored by the currently available observational data within the framework of the model considered in this study .",
