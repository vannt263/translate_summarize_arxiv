    "<S> the properties of the domain - wall energy and of the correlation length are studied numerically for the one - dimensional @xmath0 _ xy _ spin glass on the two - leg ladder lattice , focusing on both the spin and the chirality degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> analytic results obtained by ney - nifle _ et al _ for the same model were confirmed for asymptotically large lattices , while the approach to the asymptotic limit is slow and sometimes even non - monotonic . </S>",
    "<S> attention is called to the occurrence of the @xmath1-@xmath2 decoupling and its masking in spin correlations , the latter reflecting the inequality between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 exponents . </S>",
    "<S> discussion is given concerning the behaviors of the higher - dimensional models .    </S>",
    "<S>  1 introduction    the domain - wall method , or the stiffness method , is widely used in studying the ordering properties of various spin systems including the spin glass ( sg ) . in this method , </S>",
    "<S> one computes by some numerical means the change of the ground - state energy of finite systems of the linear dimension @xmath3 under the appropriate change of boundary conditions ( bcs ) imposed on the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this energy is called a stiffness energy ( or a domain - wall energy ) , @xmath4 , which gives a measure of an energy scale of low - energy excitations of size @xmath3 . for large @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4 is expected to behave as a power - law , @xmath5 , @xmath6 being a stiffness exponent . if @xmath7 , the system remains in the disordered state at any nonzero temperature , whereas if @xmath8 the system possesses a finite long - range order at low enough temperatures with @xmath9 .    for complex systems like sgs in which the nature of the ordering is highly nontrivial , </S>",
    "<S> some fundamental questions still remain in this method . </S>",
    "<S> first question concerns with the choice of the set of bcs . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , there could be various choices of the set of bcs , and the behavior of @xmath4 may depend on these choices , particularly for small sizes practically accessible in numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> it is not generally clear which set of bcs should be best chosen , especially when the results depend on the bcs . </S>",
    "<S> second question concerns with the meaning of the stiffness exponent . when the domain - wall energy decreases with @xmath3 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the stiffness exponent is negative , it is a common practice to relate the inverse of the stiffness exponent with the correlation - length exponent @xmath10 associated with the @xmath11 transition , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath12 ( @xmath13)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , there were reports which cast doubt on the validity of this simple relation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the model could exhibit more than one stiffness exponents depending on the choice of the set of bcs , a question immediately arises which stiffness exponent should be chosen to estimate the correlation - length exponent . since , in the standard continuous ( second - order ) phase transition , only one diverging length scale is expected , the existence of more than one stiffness exponent poses some problem in its interpretation .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , under certain circumstances , there could be more than one distinct diverging length scales , or more than one distinct correlation - length exponents , at a single continuous transition . </S>",
    "<S> an example of this may be seen in _ chiral transitions _ possibly realized in certain frustrated vector spin systems including the _ xy _ sg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> frustrated vector spin systems often possesses a chirality degree of freedom due to the canted spin structure , according as the noncollinear ( or noncoplanar ) structure induced spin frustration is either right- or lef - handed . </S>",
    "<S> chirality is a pseudo - scalar variable , being invariant under global spin rotations [ @xmath1 ] but changing sign under global spin reflections [ @xmath2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have suggested that some of such chiral spin systems might possibly exhibit a `` spin - chirality decoupling '' phenomenon , where the @xmath2 chirality exhibits an ordering behavior entirely different from the @xmath1 spin@xcite , though there still remains some controversy concerning whether such a spin - chirality decoupling really occurs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in one possible realization of the spin - chirality decoupling , the chirality and the spin exhibit two separate transitions at mutually distinct temperatures , whereas , in other possible realization , the chirality and the spin order at the same temperature but with the mutually different spin and chirality correlation - length exponents , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> examples of the first class might be the orderings of the regularly - frustrated two - dimensional ( 2d ) _ xy _ model @xcite and those of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath18 sg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples of the second class the ordering of the regularly frustrated one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath18 model @xcite and those of the 2d @xmath18 sg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a firmly established example is the case of the regularly - frustrated 1d @xmath18 model , where it has been shown rigorously that the spin and the chirality order at @xmath11 where the chiral correlation length diverges exponentially with @xmath19 but the spin correlation length as a power - law with @xmath20 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more controversial is the nature of the ordering of the _ xy _ sg . some time ago , kawamura and tanemura made a numerical domain - wall study of the _ xy _ sg in 2d and 3d @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors introduced various types of bcs to probe the spin and the chirality orderings of the model , including the periodic ( p ) , antiperiodic ( ap ) and reflecting ( r ) bcs . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the domain - wall energy obtained under the combination of the p and ap bcs ( p / ap ) , @xmath21 , and the one obtained under the combination of the r and p bcs , @xmath22 , apparently yielded mutually different stiffness exponents , which were interpreted as associated with the spin and the chiral correlation - length exponents , respectively . these authors observed that , in 2d , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 decreased with @xmath3 , characterized , respectively , by mutually different stiffness exponents , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation was interpreted as indicating that the chiral correlation length outgrows the spin correlation length at the @xmath11 transition of the model , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results were corroborated by several monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on the 2d @xmath18 sg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , on the basis of their domain - wall energy calculation , kosterlitz and akino claimed that the spin and the chiral correlation - length exponents were common at the @xmath11 transition @xcite .    in 3d , </S>",
    "<S> kawamura and tanemura observed that @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) decreased ( increased ) with @xmath3 , which was interpreted as indicating that the chiral - glass transition occurred at a nonzero temperature , @xmath26 , while the standard sg transition occurred only at @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mc results supporting such a view were also reported @xcite . meanwhile , later domain - wall energy calculation by macourt and grempel suggested that @xmath21 might eventually be iterated toward strong coupling for larger @xmath3 and that @xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , lee and young claimed on the basis of their mc simulations that the spin and the chirality ordered at the same finite temperature @xmath29 , with a common correlation - length exponent @xcite @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the situation remains quite controversial .    </S>",
    "<S> inspired by the numerical work of ref.@xcite on the 2d and 3d _ xy _ sg , ney - nifle , hilhorst and moore performed an analytic study of the 1d @xmath18 sg ladder with the bond - random @xmath0 ( or binary ) interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the villain s action was assumed there . via the dual transformation </S>",
    "<S> , the model was mapped onto the 1d charge hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> since the mapped model was still not amenable to the exact treatment , ney - nifle _ et al _ made further simplifications , and eventually derived several analytic results concerning the domain - wall energies and correlation lengths . </S>",
    "<S> they observed that , depending on the type of the applied bcs and on whether the total number of frustrated plaquettes is either even or odd , the domain - wall energy exhibits different behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> when the sample average is taken over all samples , @xmath31 is characterized by the chiral stiffness exponent @xmath32 , while @xmath33 is characterized by the spin - wave ( sw ) stiffness exponent @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the assignment made in ref.@xcite for the 2d and 3d _ xy _ sgs .    </S>",
    "<S> if one looks at the spin and chiral correlations of this 1d ladder model , one sees that the model exhibits the spin - chirality decoupling in the sense that there exist two distinct diverging lengths at the @xmath11 transition ( though ney - nifle _ et al _ apparently stated otherwise ) , the one associated with the @xmath2 chirality and the other associated with the @xmath1 sw . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral correlation length @xmath35 is characterized by the exponent @xmath36 , while the sw correlation length @xmath37 is characterized by the sw exponent @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the full spin correlation function is the product of the @xmath2 part with the correlation length @xmath39 and the @xmath1 part with the correlation length @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> reflecting the fact that the @xmath2 chiral correlation - length exponent happens to be smaller than the @xmath1 sw correlation - length exponent , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath41 , the full spin correlation function is dominated by the chiral exponent @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> the analytic result of ref.@xcite , though quite plausible , is not completely rigorous . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , some of the results were obtained for asymptotically large lattice . in the sg problem , it is sometimes important , and often not a trivial matter , to elucidate the finite - size effect , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , how large the system must be for exhibiting the asymptotic large - lattice behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we feel it would be useful to perform numerical study of the @xmath0 1d _ xy _ sg ladder in comparison with the analytic work of ref.@xcite . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we undertake such numerical analysis of the @xmath0 @xmath18 sg model on two - leg ladder lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of our calculation is threefold . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) we wish to test the validity of the simplifications made in the analytic work of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) we wish to elucidate the nature of the finite - size effect in this 1d model . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) we wish to further examine the relation between the stiffness exponents and the correlation - length exponents in this 1d model .    </S>",
    "<S> the following part of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we introduce the model and summarize the analytic results of ref.@xcite . in  3 , we present our numerical results of the domain - wall energies . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with those of the analytic work of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finite - size effects are analyzed carefully . in  4 , we present our numerical results of the spin and chiral correlation lengths , in comparison with the corresponding analytic results of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> relation with the stiffness exponents and the correlation - length exponents are examined . finally ,  </S>",
    "<S> 5 is devoted summary and discussion .    </S>",
    "<S>  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the model and some analytic formula    the model we consider is , firstly , the standard @xmath18-sg model on the 1d two - leg ladder lattice with the binary ( or @xmath0 ) interaction , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the two - component spin variable at the site @xmath46 , and the summation is taken over all nearest - neighbor pairs on the ladder lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the site index @xmath46 may be written as @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and 2 refer to the first and the second row of the ladder . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 represents the random variable taking either @xmath52 or @xmath53 with equal probability independently at each bond . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of the exchange interaction has been taken to be a unit of energy ( @xmath54 ) .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we impose several types of bcs on the _ xy_-spin variables at the boundary , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the periodic ( p ) , antiperiodic ( ap ) and reflecting ( r ) bcs . in these p , ap and r bcs , we impose the relations , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , respectively . in the r bc , </S>",
    "<S> we reflect the spin at the boundary with respect to the @xmath58-axis in spin space .    the local chirality variable at the plaquette @xmath58 , consisting of four spins at the sites ( @xmath59),(@xmath60 ) , ( @xmath61 ) and ( @xmath62 ) , </S>",
    "<S> are defined by @xmath63 where the summation is taken over four bonds connecting the above four sites forming the plaquette . in the ground state of an isolated frustrated plaquette , it takes a value either @xmath52 or @xmath53 , while in the ground state of an isolated unfrustrated plaquette , it takes a value equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the states with @xmath64 represent the two chiral states , with right - handed and left - handed spin circulation around the plaquette .    </S>",
    "<S> other model we consider is the effective charge hamiltonian on the dual lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest version is the so - called villain s hamiltonian , which contains only the 2-body charge interaction . </S>",
    "<S> although it has commonly been believed that the villain s hamiltonian becomes equivalent to the cosine hamiltonian in the low - temperature limit @xmath65 @xcite , we have found that this is actually not the case : the original _ xy _ hamiltonian mapped to the charge representation contains the higher - body interactions , in addition to the 2-body interaction , even in the @xmath65 limit . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the present work , we also consider these higher - body correction terms to the standard villain s 2-body approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit forms are given in the appendix .    in the cases of the p and </S>",
    "<S> ap bcs , the two - body charge hamiltonian , or the villain s hamiltonian , takes the form , @xmath66 @xmath67 respectively , where the charge variable @xmath68 , sitting at the plaquette @xmath46 , takes integer values @xmath69 on unfrustrated plaquettes , and half - integer values @xmath70 on frustrated plaquettes . </S>",
    "<S> the variable @xmath71 takes integer values @xmath69 , while @xmath72 is the `` parity '' variable being equal to zero or unity depending on whether the total number of antiferromagnetic bonds on the first row ( @xmath50 ) of the ladder is either even or odd . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the charge variables @xmath73 located at the plaquettes @xmath46 and @xmath74 is defined by @xmath75 where the summation over the wavevector @xmath76 is taken over @xmath77 . in the @xmath78 limit </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath73 reduces to @xmath79 which decays exponentially with distance @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term of eq.(2 ) and ( 4 ) represents the charge - charge interaction , while the second term of eq.(3 ) and ( 4 ) represents the sw term , which is related to the charge part via the total charge @xmath81 .    in the case of the r bc , by contrast , the corresponding two - body charge hamiltonian is given by @xmath82 where @xmath73 is still given by eq.(5 ) , but the summation over the wavevector @xmath76 is now taken over @xmath83 which yields @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is no second term ( sw term ) in @xmath85 .    to proceed further , ney - nifle _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ made the following two assumptions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , the charge variable @xmath68 is restricted to @xmath86 on frustrated plaquettes and @xmath87 on unfrustrated plaquettes . if one labels the frustrated plaquettes as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the total number of frustrated plaquettes , the chiral part of the hamiltonian reduces to the 1d ising hamiltonian with @xmath89 ising variables @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> second , ney - nifle made a further simplification that the charge - charge interaction , which originally work between arbitrary pairs of frustrated plaquettes , is restricted only to the nearest - neighbor pairs of frustrated plaquettes . </S>",
    "<S> after these two simplifications , the model reduces to the 1d ising chain with the random antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interaction , @xmath91 the random nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath92 obeys the distribution given by @xmath93 for smaller @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> the latter simply follows from eq.([eq - u ] ) and the fact that the probability to have a sequence of @xmath96 successive unfrustrated plaquettes is given by @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it should be remarked that the distribution of the effective interactions @xmath98 is not a smooth function but a collection of delta functions so that eq.([eq - pv ] ) must be taken with care .    </S>",
    "<S> these simplifications enabled ney - nifle _ et al _ to specify the explicit charge ( chirality ) pattern and the existence / non - existence of the sw excitation in the ground state of large enough lattices under the given bc , leading to various predictions on the domain - wall energies and the correlation lengths .    </S>",
    "<S>  3 . numerical results on the domain - wall energies    in this section , we numerically calculate the following two types of domain - wall energies for the 1d _ xy _ sg ladder , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , ( i ) the root - mean square of the energy difference between under the p and ap bcs , @xmath31 , and ( ii ) the absolute value of the energy difference between under the r and min(p , ap ) bcs , @xmath99 , where min(p , ap ) refers to either p or ap bc which has the lower energy than the other . </S>",
    "<S> the following three levels of numerical calculations are made .    </S>",
    "<S> _ method ( a ) _ : the first method is the direct numerical estimate of the ground - state energy of the cosine hamiltonian of finite @xmath3 under the given bc . in calculating the ground - state energy </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the spin - quench algorithm without any further approximation , </S>",
    "<S> _ i.e. _ , by starting from the randomly generated spin initial conditions , we quench the system to reach one of the local energy minima . </S>",
    "<S> these quench procedures are repeated many times , typically 5,000 times , until one is sure that the true ground state has been reached . </S>",
    "<S> if one goes to larger @xmath3 , the number of local minima increases rapidly which makes the search of the true ground state increasing difficult . </S>",
    "<S> this difficulty limits the tractable maximum lattice size to @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample average is taken over 10,000 ( @xmath101 ) - 200,000 ( @xmath102 ) independent bond realizations .    </S>",
    "<S> _ methods ( b1)-(b3 ) _ : in this group of methods , we estimate the ground - state energy of the effective charge hamiltonian of finite @xmath3 under the given bc within the first approximation of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we use the ising hamiltonian but with the distant - neighbor interaction in estimating the domain - wall energy . in identifying the chirality pattern of the ground state ( or the candidate of the ground state ) , we have made certain plausible assumptions , the detail of which will be given below for each different case : it is similar to the procedure employed in ref.@xcite , but it is systematically improved in the estimation of the domain wall energies by taking into account the distant - neighbour two - body interactions and also the higher - body intereactions . by the methods ( b1)-(b3 ) , we examined lattices considerably larger than the case ( a ) , up to @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample average is taken over 100,000 independent bond realizations .    </S>",
    "<S> _ method ( c ) _ : in this third method , we estimate the ground - state energy of the villain s hamiltonian of finite @xmath3 under the given bc by assuming both the first and the second approximations of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we use the ising hamiltonian with the nearest - neighbor interaction in estimating the domain - wall energy . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we can deal with lattices still larger than the cases ( b1)-(b3 ) , and the results for asymptotically large @xmath3 should reduce to the analytic results of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sample average is taken over 100,000 independent bond realizations .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results of these five levels of calculations ( a ) , ( b1)-(b3 ) and ( c ) to examine the validity of the approximations made in ref.@xcite , and to elucidate the nature of the finite - size effects in this model .    in the original cosine model ( 1 ) , the local chirality at each plaquette </S>",
    "<S> is given by eq.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the ground - state , the _ local _ chirality distribution is expected to be peaked around @xmath104 for frustrated plaquettes , and around @xmath105 for unfrustrated plaquettes . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked numerically that this is indeed the case . as shown in fig.1 , </S>",
    "<S> the local chirality on frustrated plaquettes takes the values around @xmath106 with equal probability , while that on unfrustrated plaquettes takes the values around @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> such a distribution of the local chirality enables us to label the chirality pattern uniquely only by the combination of @xmath108 and @xmath109 on frustrated plaquettes .     at each plaquette in the ground state of the @xmath0 @xmath18 ladder . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice size is size @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the data for frustrated and unfrustrated plaquettes are given in blue ( at the center @xmath105 ) and in red ( near the edges @xmath104 ) , respectively . ]    in the present 1d model , as was first suggested by ney - nifle _ et al _ @xcite , the behavior of the domain - wall energy largely depends on whether the total number of frustrated plaquettes @xmath89 is either even or odd . </S>",
    "<S> we call these samples `` even '' and `` odd '' samples , respectively . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we show the results for the even and odd cases separately .     </S>",
    "<S> 3.1 even samples    3.1.1 the domain - wall energy : @xmath31    for even samples , ref.@xcite predicted that the domain - wall energy @xmath31 was dominated for large enough lattices by the contribution of a pair of chiral domain - wall excitations not accompanying the sw excitation . the chiral domain - wall may be defined here as the place where the `` chiral overlap '' between the two chirality configurations 1 and 2 under the two bcs , @xmath110 , changes the sign . according to ref.@xcite , under the min(p , ap ) bc , </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the chirality pattern alternates on frustrated plaquettes without misfit , while under the max(p , ap ) bc , a pair of misfits is introduced into the alternating chirality pattern , but not accompanying the sw excitation : a pair of chirality misfits is introduced into the sample in such a way that one is at the weakest connection , _ </S>",

    "<S> .    the domain - wall energy associated with the r / min(p , ap ) bc , @xmath33 , is governed by a chiral domain - wall excitation , with and without the sw for odd and even samples . </S>",
    "<S> absence or presence of the sw excitation gives rise to the different asymptotic behaviors of @xmath33 for even and odd samples , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the sw excitation , whenever it is induced , governs the large-@xmath3 asymptotic behavior of the domain wall energy since @xmath189 in the present model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath33 is characterized by an asymptotic stiffness exponent @xmath190 and @xmath50 for even and odd samples , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize again that , if the inequality between @xmath185 and @xmath186 would be opposite , @xmath33 would always be characterized by the chiral exponent @xmath185 for both even and odd samples .    </S>",
    "<S> we also numerically investigated the behavior of the spin and the chiral correlation lengths . both exhibit the divergence characterized by the chiral exponent @xmath191 , whereas this asymptotic behavior sets in only at low temperatures @xmath168 and at longer length scale @xmath169 . at higher temperatures @xmath170 and at shorter length scale @xmath171 , a different power - law behavior characterized by an apparent exponent @xmath172 is realized . </S>",
    "<S> although both the spin and the chiral correlation lengths exhibit the critical behavior with a common exponent @xmath185 , the system in fact possesses two distinct diverging length scales : one associated with the @xmath1 sw and the other associated with the @xmath2 chirality . in that sense , the @xmath1 part and the @xmath2 part </S>",
    "<S> are decoupled in this model . reflecting the inequality @xmath192 , however , the spin correlation is dominated by the chiral exponent @xmath17 , not by the sw exponent @xmath174 . _ </S>",
    "<S> the inherent spin - chirality decoupling of the present model is then masked_.    these behaviors of the domain - wall energies and of the correlation lengths of the 1d @xmath0 @xmath18 sg ladder are seemingly at odds with the behaviors of the corresponding 2d and 3d models suggested in refs @xcite . in the 2d and 3d @xmath18 sg , </S>",
    "<S> refs . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xcite ) conjectured that @xmath31 was governed by the @xmath1 spin exponent , while @xmath33 was governed by the @xmath2 chiral exponent . </S>",
    "<S> this should be contrasted with the behavior of the present 1d model where @xmath31 was governed by the @xmath2 chiral exponent while @xmath33 was governed by the @xmath1 spin ( sw ) exponent . as argued in the previous section , </S>",
    "<S> however , this apparent difference is simply the consequence of the difference in the relative magnitude of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 exponents between the two models . indeed , in the 2d case , ref.@xcite estimated @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath31 , respectively , where one has @xmath193 in contrast to the present 1d case . if the inequality between the two stiffness exponents @xmath194 and @xmath186 were opposite in the present 1d model , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath187 , essentially the same behavior as that in the 2d and 3d models , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath195 and @xmath196 , would arise . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the apparent large deviation from ref.@xcite is merely due to the difference in the relative magnitudes of the two stiffness ( and correlation - length ) exponents .    in this connection </S>",
    "<S> , a significant difference between the present 1d ladder model and the higher - dimensional models might be that , while the effective interaction between the charge variables @xmath68 is short - ranged in 1d , that in higher dimensions is _ long - ranged_. this assigns a non - trivial character to the charged excitation in the higher dimensional models . in 2d , this charged excitation could be viewed as a vortex . </S>",
    "<S> ( in 3d , it is a vortex - line . ) </S>",
    "<S> the important characteristic of such a vortex excitation is that it breaks the charge neutrality condition and interacts with each other via the long - ranged coulombic interaction . in the present 1d ladder model , even though there certainly exists an excitation which apparently breaks the charge - neutrality condition , the associated interaction between them is always short - ranged , and can not be regarded as a genuinely - charged vortex - like excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in higher dimensions , excitations associated with the charge excitation are at least of two distinct types : the one is the vortex excitation which breaks the charge - neutrality , and the second one is the ordinary chiral excitation which preserve the charge - neutrality . in 2d , </S>",
    "<S> the former one is a point defect ( vortex ) , while the latter is a line defect ( domain - wall ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the former vortex - like excitation exists in both frustrated and unfrustrated @xmath18 spin models , often playing a vital role in the order - disorder process , while the latter chiral excitation is peculiar to the _ frustrated _ @xmath18 spin models . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that , in higher dimensions , this genuinely - charged vortex excitation might give rise to the another diverging length scale which predominantly disorder the spin ( not the chiral ) order . </S>",
    "<S> a possible conjecture would be that the stiffness exponent associated with the vortex excitation @xmath197 takes a value smaller than the sw stiffness exponent or the chiral stiffness exponent , and is more effective in disordering the spin . </S>",
    "<S> if this is really the case , the spin correlation length and the domain - wall energy @xmath31 would be governed by the non - chiral exponent @xmath197 associated with the genuinely - charged excitation . in the 2d @xmath18 sg with the @xmath0 interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical estimate of refs.@xcite suggested @xmath198 , which appears to be larger than @xmath199 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that , even in 1d , the long - ranged interaction between the charge variables could arise in some special cases , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , in the tube lattice investigated by hill _ et al _ @xcite . in the tube lattice , however , the application of neither the p , ap nor the r bcs is capable of generating the genuinely - charged vortex excitation , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the excitation in the @xmath200 variable in the notation of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the application of either the p , ap and r bcs generates only the charge - neutral chiral excitation , the excitation in the @xmath201 variable in the notation of ref.@xcite , which interacts only via the short - ranged interaction . as such , the role of the genuinely - charged vortex excitation still remains to be seen in the 1d tube model . in order to elucidate the nature of the spin and the chirality orderings of the frustrated _ xy _ spin systems </S>",
    "<S> , it would be important to further clarify the role of the vortex - like genuinely - charged excitation , not only in the 1d tube model but also in the higher - dimensional models .    in the present paper , we concentrated on the _ xy _ sg ladder with the @xmath0 interaction . the corresponding model with the gaussian interaction </S>",
    "<S> was also studied in the literature , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical study suggested that these two models , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the 1d _ xy _ sg ladder with either the @xmath0 or the gaussian interaction exhibit quite different behaviors . the properties of the 1d _ xy _ sg ladder with the gaussian interaction will be reported elsewhere @xcite . </S>"
