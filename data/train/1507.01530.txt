    "recent advances on information technologies facilitate real - time message exchanges and decision - making among geographically dispersed strategic entities .",
    "this has boosted the emergence of new generation of networked systems ; e.g. , the smart grid and intelligent transportation systems .",
    "these networked systems share some common features : on one hand , the entities do not belong to a single authority and may pursue different or even competitive interests ; on the other hand , each entity keeps private information which is unaccessible to others .",
    "it is of great interest to design practical mechanisms which allow for efficient coordination of self - interested entities and ensure network - wide performance",
    ". game theory along with its distributed computation algorithms represents a promising tool to achieve the goal .    in many applications ,",
    "distributed computation is executed in uncertain environments .",
    "for example , mobile robots are deployed in an operating environment where environmental distribution functions are unknown to robots in advance ; e.g. ,  @xcite . in traffic pricing",
    ", pricing policies of system operators may not be available to drivers .",
    "in optimal power flow control , the structural parameters of power systems are of national security interest and kept confidential from the public .",
    "the absence of such information makes game components ; e.g. , objective and constraint functions , inaccessible to players .",
    "very recently , the informational constraint has been stimulating the investigation of _ adaptive _ algorithms , including  @xcite for continuous games and  @xcite for discrete games .    _ literature review .",

    "the set of papers more relevant to our work is concerned with generalized nash games where strategy spaces are continuous and the actions of players are coupled through utility and constraint functions .",
    "generalized nash games are first formulated in  @xcite . since then , a great effort has been dedicated to studying the existence and structural properties of generalized nash equilibria in ; e.g. ,  @xcite and the recent survey paper  @xcite .",
    "a number of algorithms have been proposed to compute generalized nash equilibria , including ode - based methods  @xcite , nonlinear gauss - seidel - type approaches  @xcite , iterative primal - dual tikhonov schemes  @xcite and best - response dynamics  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , the set of papers  @xcite investigates the _ adaptiveness _ of game theoretic learning algorithms .",
    "however , none of the papers mentioned in the last two paragraphs studies the _ robustness _ of the algorithms with respect to network unreliability ; e.g. , data transmission delays , quantization and dynamically changing topologies .",
    "in contrast , the robustness has been extensively studied for consensus and distributed optimization , including , to name a few ,  @xcite for time - varying topologies ,  @xcite for quantization and  @xcite for time delays . yet",

    "each player is associated with a convex objective function and subject to a private convex inequality constraint and a private convex constraint set .",
    "the component functions are assumed to be smooth and are unknown to the associated players .",
    "we investigate distributed first - order gradient - based computation algorithms for the following two scenarios :    [ scenario one ] the game map is pseudo - monotone and the maximum delay ( equivalently , the maximum number of packet dropouts or link breaks ) is bounded but unknown ;    [ scenario two ] the inequality constraints are absent , the ( reduced ) game map is strongly monotone and the maximum delay is known .    inspired by simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation for optimization in  @xcite , we utilize finite differences with diminishing approximation errors to estimate first - order gradients .",
