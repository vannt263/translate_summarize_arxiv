    "hard pion and kaon production in proton - proton ( @xmath5 ) and proton - nucleus ( @xmath6 ) collisions at these energies is in itself of interest , but it is also imperative to study these reactions as a step in the process of understanding hard @xmath7 and @xmath8 production in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath9 ) collisions .",
    "the necessity of this systematic approach has been made particularly clear by the high - visibility parallel developments in the subfield of @xmath10 production@xcite .",

    "higher energies are less thoroughly explored , with mostly calorimetric data on total hadron production ( in lieu of the identified pion and kaon spectra at lower energies ) . in the present paper , we use cern ua1@xcite and tevatron cdf@xcite data from @xmath11 reactions to bracket the rhic energy range from above .    the presence of nuclear effects modifies the predictions of the pqcd - improved parton model for hard particle production in @xmath6 collisions , as indicated by available @xmath6 hadron production data@xcite .",
    "while hard particle production ( usually disregarding nuclear effects ) has been used as a testing ground for pqcd , the nuclear modifications are crucially important for rhic experiments and planned nuclear experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in particular ,",
