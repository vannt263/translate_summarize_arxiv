    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics suffers from the gauge hierarchy and flavor hierarchy problems and many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) extensions have been proposed to solve these problems .",

    "we emphasize that the signatures we identify and the search strategies are common to many other bsm theories that contain such vectorlike quarks .",
    "a particular emphasis is the single - production of the heavy colored fermions in addition to their pair - production , since single - production couplings depend more directly on their electroweak quantum numbers , while pair - production is dominated by its coupling to the gluon which is given by the @xmath7 gauge coupling @xmath8 , and thus hides its electroweak aspects .",

    "moreover , compared to pair - production , single production also have less complications from combinatorics . depending on the coupling , some single production channel can even be the dominant production channel for heavy vectorlike quarks due to the phase - space suppression in pair - production .    in ref .",

    "<S> we study the lhc signatures of tev scale vectorlike quarks @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 with electromagnetic charges @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 that appear in many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) extensions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider warped extra - dimensional models and analyze the phenomenology of such vectorlike quarks that are the custodial partners of third generation quarks . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the usually studied pair - production channels which depend on the strong coupling , we put equal emphasis on single production channels that depend on electroweak couplings and on electroweak symmetry breaking induced mixing effects between the heavy vectorlike quarks and standard model quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we identify new promising @xmath6-initiated pair and single production channels and find the luminosity required for discovering these states at the lhc . for these channels , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a cut that allows one to extract the relevant electroweak couplings . although the motivation is from warped models , we present many of our results model - independently . </S>"
