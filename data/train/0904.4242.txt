    "the principle of complementarity states that quantum systems have properties which are real but mutually exclusive @xcite .",
    "basically it says that the wave - like and particle - like behaviours of a quantum system can not be observed simultaneously in an experiment .",
    "a typical example is the young s double slit experiment where it is impossible to obtain interference fringes and complete which - path ( slit ) information .",
    "einstein tried to circumvent this statement by introducing the classic recoiling slit gedanken experiment : the position of the particle in a far screen and the momentum that it transfers to the double slit would be measured such that interference and which - path would be retrieved . however , using the uncertainty principle , bohr refuted einstein s idea , recovering the notion of complementarity @xcite .",
    "the role of entanglement in the wave - particle duality came later and was first discussed by wootters and zurek @xcite when analyzing einstein s gedanken experiment .",
    "after this , scully and drhl reinforced this idea showing that , in some circumstances , the entanglement between interfering particles and the measurement device ( which is a quantum system ) is the reason for the loss of interference , and not the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "the states of this device serve as which - path markers ( wpm ) of the possible paths of the interfering particle and if they are orthogonal , the interference is destroyed even if they are not measured .",
    "however , they have shown that this which - path information ( wpi ) can be `` erased '' and interference recovered by correlating measurements on the interfering particle with suitable measurements on the wpm .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as _ quantum eraser _",
    "@xcite , and has been subject of intensive research in the last three decades ( for a nice review see @xcite ) .",
    "several quantum eraser experiments have been done employing two - photon states from spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these implementations is the use of von  neumann measurements to obtain wpi .",
    "furthermore , with the exception of @xcite , these experiments employ maximally entangled states among the interfering photon and the wpm .",
    "in this article we report the implementation of an optical quantum eraser with the aim of studying this phenomenon in the context of state discrimination . here",
    "a photon pair is produced by spdc in an entangled polarization state and one photon of the pair is sent through a double slit .",
    "a single - photon interference pattern is observed at the far field , independent of the polarization state of the pair . in order to introduce wpi a quarter - wave plate",
    "is placed behind each slit with their fast axes orthogonally oriented [ see fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) ] .",
    "this birefringent double slit couples the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of the interfering photon and thanks to the initial polarization entanglement the wpi becomes available into the polarization of both photons . until this point",
    "there is a clear resemblance with the setup reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the main distinguishing characteristics of our experiment are : first , we start with polarization entangled states with an arbitrary degree of entanglement , which can make the wpm to be non - orthogonal states .",
    "second , we place a suitable polarization projector right after the birefringent double slit which makes the wpi to be carried just by the spatially separated photon . in @xcite",
    "the wpi is carried into two orthogonal maximally entangled polarization states and hence it can be erased by a suitable projection of the polarization of any photon of the pair , either the spatially separated photon or the interfering photon itself .",
    "finally , we use a polarization - sensitive mach - zehnder interferometer to manipulate locally and probabilistically the inner product of the wpm states , rather than resorting to polarization projections . with this setup the measurement of wpi or quantum erasure",
    "is closely related to the problem of discriminating among non - orthogonal states .",
    "the use of the interferometer will allow us to map , probabilistically , the initial states of the wpm onto pairs of states with any desired inner product at one of the output ports .",
    "thus it is possible , for instance , to map initial non - orthogonal states onto orthogonal ones to get complete wpi , or onto collinear states to restore the maximum interference . finally ,",
    "is important to note that all the key ingredients for an optimal demonstration of a quantum eraser @xcite are present : ( i ) possibility of delayed choice , i.e. , the analysis of the wpm is carried out after the interfering particle has been detected @xcite , ( ii ) the setup employs single particles and ( iii ) the wpi is carried by a spatially separated system from the interfering particle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec_theory ] we describe the experimental setup and the theory behind our implementation of the quantum eraser . in section  [ sec_results ]",
    "we present the experimental results and we conclude in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "the experimental setup is sketched in figure  [ fig0 ] . a 351.1  nm single - mode ar@xmath0-ion",
    "laser pumps with 150  mw two 0.5  mm thick @xmath1-barium borate ( bbo ) nonlinear crystals cut for type - i phase matching and with their optical axes oriented @xmath2 with respect to each other .",
    "pairs of photons , usually called signal ( s ) and idler ( i ) , are generated by spdc at an angle of @xmath3 with the pump beam and those with the same wavelength of 702.2  nm are selected by 10.0  nm bandwidth interference filters centered at this wavelength and placed in front of the photodetectors .",
    "the two - photon state generated by this setup is given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) denotes horizontal ( vertical ) polarization , @xmath7 and @xmath8 describes the spatial part of the two - photon state which will be discussed later .",
    "the amplitude and phase of @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be controlled by manipulating a half - wave plate ( hwp ) and a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) placed in the pump beam [ figure  [ fig0](a ) ] . for our future purposes the state in equation  ( [ source ] ) can be cast in the following form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 which turns out to be real .",
    "after the photon pair has been generated , the signal photon is directed through a double slit placed at 26  cm from the crystals .",
    "the spatial mode of the idler photon is defined by pinholes ( 1.5  mm diameter ) placed along its path . in order to observe single photon interference , one of the basic requirements for a quantum eraser experiment @xcite ,",
    "the pump beam is focused into the bbo crystals using a 15  cm focal length lens [ see figure  [ fig0](a ) ] .",
    "this procedure increases the transverse coherence length of the signal photon at the double slit plane @xcite .",
    "the spatial part of the two - photon state right after the double slit can then be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spatial mode of the idler photon defined by the pinholes ; @xmath15 is associated with the transmission of the signal photon through the slit @xmath16 , and it is proportional to @xmath17 @xcite ( @xmath18 is a single - photon state with transverse component of the wave vector equal to @xmath19 ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are defined below ) .",
    "the phase @xmath22 between the two possible paths can be set , for instance , by tilting the double slit .",
    "using equations  ( [ source1 ] ) and ( [ spa ] ) the total two - photon state is written ( without normalization ) as @xmath23    to show that ( [ spa ] ) is in fact the spatial part of the two - photon state and that it is independent of the polarization degree of freedom we measure the coincidence and single count rates in the far field by scanning a `` pointlike '' detector at the signal arm and detecting the idler with a `` bucket '' detector , i.e. , a detector that does not register where the photon has arrived .",
    "the measurements are done without analyzing their polarization .",
    "this corresponds to tracing out the polarization of both photons ( coincidences ) or the idler photon and the signal polarization ( single counts ) . in both cases the detection probability is @xcite @xmath24 , \\label{interf1}\\ ] ] which is a typical double slit interference pattern .",
    "@xmath25 is the pump wave number , @xmath20 is the slit half width ( 40  @xmath26 m ) , @xmath21 is the slits centre - to - centre separation ( 280  @xmath26 m ) , @xmath27 is the transverse position of the signal detector and @xmath28 is the distance from the double slit to the detector ( in this experiment @xmath28 is actually the focal length of a lens ) . the basic setup is shown in figure  [ fig0](a ) , but in this case there is neither quarter - wave plates ( qwp ) behind the double slit nor polarization projector ( qwp+polarizer ) after that .",
    "also , the idler is sent directly to a detector without passing through the interferometer .",
    "both detectors are placed in the focal plane of a 30  cm focal length lens . in front of the signal detector",
    "there is a 50  @xmath26 m @xmath29 5  mm slit oriented parallel to the double slit while at the idler detector a 3  mm pinhole .",
    "we prepare a maximally and a non - maximally entangled polarization state and characterize them by quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "the purities obtained were higher than 95% , which allowed us to consider the two - photon polarization state to be essentially pure and given by equation  ( [ source ] ) . in these measurements we set @xmath22 in ( [ interf1 ] ) to be zero .",
    "for the maximally entangled state the inner product of @xmath30 [ see equation  ( [ innerp ] ) ] is @xmath31 and the results for the singles and coincidences are shown in figure  [ singles](a ) . for the non - maximally",
    "entangled we get @xmath32 and the results are shown in figure  [ singles](b ) .",
    "the less - than - one visibilities are due to the finite size of the signal detector and the finite size of the source which makes the degree of transverse coherence differs from the unity .",

    "the entanglement in polarization is maximal while it is non - maximal in ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "the solid lines for the singles are just a guide while for the coincidences they are theoretical fits obtained from equation  ( [ interferencesignal ] ) using a normalization and the visibility ( shown in the insets ) as a free parameters .",
    "the visibilities of the singles are the same when the background noise is subtracted .",
    "different count rates resulted from the losses due to the wave plates and the non - identical alignment in the two cases.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      at this point there is no wpi available yet . in order to introduce it",
    "we place a quarter - wave plate behind each slit with their fast axes orthogonally oriented as shown in figure  [ fig0](b ) .",
    "the action of these wave plates couples the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of the signal photon and transforms the two - photon state given by equation  ( [ source3 ] ) into @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent left and right circular polarizations , respectively .",
    "this state already carries wpi in the _ two - photon _ polarization state due to the initial polarization entanglement , what has been shown in @xcite .    using the same states we made the same set of measurements described previously . for the initial maximally entangled polarization state",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ singles](c ) .",
    "as the wpm states are ( ideally ) orthogonal the interference observed in figure  [ singles](a ) is destroyed .",
    "the residual visibility observed in this case ( @xmath36 ) is due to the non - perfect alignment of the wave plates behind the slits which produces states @xmath37 non - exactly orthogonal . for the initial non - maximally entangled state ,",
    "the wpm states are non - orthogonal and the visibility of the pattern observed in figure  [ singles](b ) is reduced to a degree that depends on their inner product . in this case @xmath38 and as shown in figure  [ singles](d ) the visibility is @xmath39 which agrees well with the inner product within the experimental error .",
    "some of the basic requirements for an optimal demonstration of a quantum eraser have been fulfilled , that is , we have single photon interference and we can imprint wpi which can be either used to detect which - path or erased to restore interference . however , as stressed in @xcite it is pedagogically preferable that the wpi be carried separately from the interfering particle .",
    "this is not the case for the state in equation  ( [ psi1 ] ) . to satisfy this condition",
    "we must make a further projection of the signal polarization right after its transmission through the birefringent double slit .",
    "projecting , for example , onto @xmath34 the two - photon state in ( [ psi1 ] ) becomes @xmath40 where @xmath41 $ ] is a normalization constant . in this expression",
    "we have omitted the factorable polarization ( spatial ) state of the signal ( idler ) photon to stress that the interfering particle ( signal ) and the wpm ( idler ) are nonlocally correlated .",
    "this projection just forces the entanglement between signal spatial degree of freedom and idler polarization and in this sense works as a _ disentanglement eraser _",
    "besides the pedagogical appeal , working with this state will allow us to manipulate locally the state of the wpm and study the quantum eraser in the context of state discrimination .",
    "after tracing out the polarization or the idler in ( [ source3-filtered ] ) , the coincidence or single counts detection probability will be given by @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{interferencesignal}\\ ] ] comparing with equation  ( [ interf1 ] ) one can see that the visibility that was one in that case is now governed by the absolute value of the inner product , @xmath43 , of the wpm states given by ( [ innerp ] ) and shown in the results of figure  [ singles ] .",
    "the phase of this pattern depends on the sign of @xmath43 .      in order to make which - path or quantum eraser measurements the wpm",
    "must be projected onto a suitable state and its detection be correlated to the detection of the interfering particle , which in our case is done through coincidence measurements . from equation  ( [ source3-filtered ] )",
    "one can see that when the entanglement among these systems is maximal , wpi can be retrieved by measuring an observable spanned by the _",
    "states @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the signal count rate conditioned upon the detection of the idler do not exhibit interference .",
    "actually , as a consequence of the entanglement the interference is destroyed even when the wpm is not detected or it is detected by a polarization insensitive measurement as is shown in figures  [ singles](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "on the other hand , wpi can be erased and interference restored by measuring an observable whose eigenstates has equal components on the states @xmath30 and then correlating the results to the detection of the interfering particle .",
    "for instance , when the idler is projected onto the symmetric @xmath44 or antisymmetric @xmath45 state and its detection is correlated to the detection of the signal photon , the interference is restored in the form of fringes or antifringes , respectively .",
    "a more general situation corresponds to non - maximal entanglement in ( [ source3-filtered ] ) , or equivalently to a wpm described by two non - orthogonal states . in this case",
    "the wpi will be partial which reduces the visibility of the interference pattern as can be seen in equation  ( [ interferencesignal ] ) and in figures  [ singles](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "this partial wpi can be erased in the same way as in the case of a maximally entangled state .",
    "however , the intensity of each pattern will be modulated by @xmath46 ( fringes ) and @xmath47 ( antifringes ) .",
    "the retrieval of wpi in this case is a more delicate matter .",
    "non - orthogonal states can not be perfect and deterministically discriminated @xcite since the eigenstates of any observable acting on the hilbert space has non - vanishing components on both states @xmath30 .",
    "the best strategy of error - free identification turns out to be of probabilistic nature and considers the possibility of an inconclusive identification @xcite .      for arbitrary states of the wpm we can resort to a _",
    "method for the unambiguous modification of their inner product . in our experiment",
    "this is done by using a polarization - sensitive mach - zehnder interferometer depicted in figure  [ fig0](c ) .",

    "the quantum eraser is a phenomenon closely related with several important subjects lying at the heart of quantum theory : interference , complementarity , entanglement , non - locality , delayed choice and state discrimination as well .",
    "here we have mainly exploited this later aspect by implementing an experiment where an interfering single photon is entangled with another one serving as which - path marker and whose states are non - orthogonal .",
    "consequently , we neither have complete wpi nor a null visibility of the interference pattern . however , we have shown that it is possible to apply a probabilistic method for unambiguous modification of the inner product of such states to achieve any desired value of this quantity .",
    "therefore we could , for instance , map the non - orthogonal states onto orthogonal ones and get complete wpi ( destroying the interference ) or onto collinear states to recover the interference with maximum visibility .",
    "this would not be possible by using just projection analysis .    to perform this experiment we used photon pairs generated by spdc with arbitrary degree of polarization entanglement .",
    "sending one of these photons through a double slit we observed single - photon interference ( by a suitable focusing of the pump beam into the crystals ) showing that such interference is independent of the polarization degree of freedom . placing quarter - wave plates with their fast axes orthogonally oriented behind each slit we were able of coupling the spatial and polarization degrees of freedom introducing wpi for the interfering photon . after a suitable projection of its polarization we made this wpi to be carried just by the spatially separated photon which then goes through a polarization - sensitive mach - zehnder interferometer that implements the protocol described above . in this setup",
    "it is possible , for a suitable setting of the interferometer , to achieve an complete wpi by detecting the wpm at one output port of the interferometer or maximum visibility interference if the detection is performed at the other port .",
    "the only constraint is that the initial inner product of the wpm states might be preserved since the unitary operation applied on the wpm is local , what has been shown here .",
    "we would like to thank c. h. monken for lending us the sanded quarter - wave plates used in the double slit .",
