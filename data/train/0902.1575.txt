    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the le as a function of the time @xmath51 and the coupling strength @xmath67 in the normal and super - radiant phases .",
    "it is obvious that the le , which is calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ calculate - b ] ) , ( [ lenormal ] ) , and ( [ lesuper1 ] ) , will have a sudden change near the critical point .",
    "its decay is highly enhanced at the critical value @xmath69 . in the normal phase",

    ", the le decays faster as the parameter @xmath67 decreases to the critical point @xmath69 .",
    "then the coherence of the extra atom is very sensitive to the dynamical perturbation of the photon - dressed atomic ensemble near the critical point .",
    "meanwhile , in the vicinity of the critical point , the coherence of the extra atom decreases to zero sharply with time at fixed point of @xmath67 .",
    "the more nearly the work point @xmath67 approaches the critical point @xmath69 , the sharper the decay of the decoherence of the extra atom is . during this process",
    ", the detected atom evolves from a pure state to a mixed one .",
    "therefore , we can measure the qpt of the photon - dressed atomic ensemble by exploring the coherence of the detected atom in the photon - dressed atomic ensemble .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the le at a fixed time ( @xmath135 ) for the photon - dressed atomic ensemble in both the normal and super - radiant phases .",
    "contrary to the case of the transverse field ising model , the le in the present system will not approach @xmath136 when the coupling strength is much more than the critical point ( seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that a large displacement @xmath137 appears in the super - radiant phase and will increase as the coupling strength increases .",
    "that means a small disparity ( @xmath138 ) in the initial hamiltonian in the super - radiant phase may lead to a large difference ( e.g. , the decoherence factor will decay faster ) after period of long - enough time . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the so - called quantum chaos always appears in the super - radiant phase .     at @xmath139 .",
    "for other parameters see fig .",
    "[ fig2].,width=302 ]    it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ calculate - b ] ) , ( [ lenormal ] ) , and  ( [ f ] ) that , the le is independent of @xmath30 in the normal phase",
    ". however , the le depends on the number of the atoms @xmath30 in the super - radiant phase via @xmath140 @xmath141 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the le is plotted as a function of the coupling strength @xmath67 with @xmath134 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the le line decays faster and faster in the super - radiant phase as the atom number @xmath30 increases .",
    "the reason is the same as that mentioned above .",
    "the photon number variance @xmath66 proportional to the decay rate for the decoherence of the extra atom increases as @xmath30 increases via approximately @xmath144 accordingly , the le decreases with the form @xmath145 in the super - radiant phase .",
    "thus , as @xmath75 , the decay of the le will be strongly enhanced at the critical point .     at @xmath146 . in normal phase ,",
    "the le is independent of @xmath30 . in super - radiant phase ,",
    "@xmath134 ( solid line ) , @xmath142 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath143 ( dotted line ) , respectively , from up to bottom . for other parameters",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig2].,width=302 ]",
    "now we can address the similarity of sensitive dynamics between the present system and the classical cloud chamber . in classical cloud chamber ,",
    "when a charged particle ( or a dust ) flies into the cloud chamber , which is filled with supersaturated and supercooled water or alcohol , the water or alcohol vapor will condensate around the flying charged particle ( or a dust ) and form a liquid droplet , then a track is left . during this process , as a result of the sensitivity in response to the extra particle , the supersaturated vapor staying in the vicinity of the classical phase transition experiences a classical phase transition , transiting from vapor to liquid .    in the present investigation ,",
    "similarly , there exists very sensitive dynamics of the photon - dressed atomic ensemble when a far - off - resonant atom goes through the cavity . in view of the stark effect , the far - off - resonant atom shifts the frequency of the cavity field .",
    "we assume that the photon - dressed atomic ensemble is initially prepared in a state near the quantum critical point of the qpt of the dicke model .",
    "then the frequency change induced by the far - off - resonant atom will lead the dicke model to cross the quantum critical point , resulting in a sensitive dynamics of the le .",
    "this quantum effect is similar to the classical phenomenon in the realistic cloud chamber that the vapor in the cloud chamber will condensate around the microscopic detected particle after experiencing the classical phase transition .",
    "therefore , it is possible to realize the quantum version of the cloud chamber effect through observing the sensitive change in the le of the photon - dressed atomic ensemble .    here , the enhancement of the decay of le or its sudden change can be regarded as an indicator of the one - atom induced qpt to detect the passage of the atom .",
    "this fact properly resembles the cloud chamber effect . in this analogy ,",
    "the photon - dressed atomic ensemble , which can be tuned to the vicinity of the qpt point , behaves as the supersaturated vapor in the classical cloud chamber , while the enhancement of the decay of le just resembles the transition from vapor to liquid .",
    "indeed , the le in our paper is obtained from the decoherence factor for time evolution of the extra atom , but it actually represents the  mark \" of this atom on the  cloud chamber \"  the photon - dressed atomic ensemble .",
    "an obvious reason is that the le only depends on the parameters of the  chamber \" and , thus , is an intrinsic quantity of the chamber .",
    "especially , the extra atom can only provide a small perturbation ; thus , the le is independent of the detected particle . in most of the references",
    "we cite , the le can be defined without the detected particle by the chamber .",
    "it is only in our own paper  @xcite where the detected particle is introduced and it is proved that the decoherence factor of the detected particle is just the le of the chamber .",
    "thus , the le is obviously the mark of the detected particle left in the chamber .",
    "in summary , based on the qpt of the dicke model , we have proposed a quantum critical model to display the ultra - sensitivity of dynamic evolution of a qpt system of a photon - dressed atomic ensemble .",
    "we have also pointed out the analog of this one - atom induced qpt to the cloud chamber based on qpt .",
    "frankly we have to point out that such a model can not be implemented easily with the generic amo system , since the two - photon term could not be simply ignored in the over - strong coupling limit  @xcite . however , our present study is still heuristic and the toy model covers the principle ideas for qpt inducing the cloud chamber - like effect .",
    "furthermore , with the great development of solid quantum device physics , the dicke model may be realized in some solid - state systems such as the super - conducting quantum circuits and the nano - mechanical resonators integrated with some qubit array systems .",
    "finally , we would like to mention a reference  @xcite , in which an effective dicke model was derived in a multilevel atomic ensemble . in this reference ,",
    "the two - photon term @xmath22 may be safely ignored originally ; thus , the modified dicke model based on such a practical setup may be used to display the qpt phenomena we found in this paper .",
