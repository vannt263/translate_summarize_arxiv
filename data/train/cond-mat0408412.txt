    "controlling and preserving coherent quantum dynamics in the framework of quantum information processing is a challenging task.@xcite very recently , more and more experiments on implementing such ideas in mesoscopic systems based on solid state devices @xcite have been realized , e.g.   josephson junctions,@xcite and also single electron spins in single defect centers.@xcite the electron spin in quantum dots has been recognized early as a potential carrier of quantum information,@xcite but experimental developments of suitable mesoscopic devices have only recently been pursued .    in previous work",
    "it was shown how quantum dots may serve as spin filters , or memory devices for electron spin.@xcite important progress was made in both theoretical and experimental research focusing on measurement schemes through charge currents.@xcite even a single - shot readout of the electron spin state has been realized @xcite and allows for the measurement of the relaxation time of a single spin . still ,",
    "the decoherence time of a single electron spin in a quantum dot has not yet been determined experimentally .",
    "in some of these experiments important quantities are the counting statistics of tunneling electrons.@xcite as for charge qubits , a measurement on the single electron level may be achieved through a single electron transistor ( set ) device @xcite or with a quantum point contact ( qpc ) close to the quantum dot.@xcite    it is important to realize that the measurement through a charge current itself has dynamical implications for the measured qubit .",
    "we are thus lead to the problem of noise and statistics induced by the measurement process in these mesoscopic systems.@xcite such problems have been tackled some time ago very elegantly through the concept of _ quantum trajectories _ in quantum optical applications.@xcite in particular , jump processes to describe the time evolution of open systems while counting emitted quanta are well established in the framework of systems that are described by a master equation of lindblad type .",
    "such ideas have already been applied to measurement processes based on quantum point contacts in mesoscopic devices.@xcite in the context of quantum information processing , such quantum trajectory methods turn out to be essential for the design of active quantum error correcting codes @xcite and , more generally , of quantum feedback mechanisms.@xcite    historically , a major driving force behind the development of quantum trajectory methods were the growing possibilities to experiment with single quantum systems in traps or cavities .",
    "more recently , such experiments have been extended to mesoscopic solid state devices .",
    "therefore , we expect a growing need for such methods in these fields .    the aim of this paper is to show how quantum trajectories serve as a useful framework to discuss the physics of mesoscopic carriers of quantum information under continuous measurement . in particular , we determine counting statistics of electrons tunneling through a quantum dot , depending on the electron spin - state .",
    "we show how a simple setup for state tomography can be achieved through a measurement of counting statistics in combination with a coherent esr field .",
    "we display how decoherence and relaxation time scales can be extracted from the measured data , in the time domain .",
    "we consider a quantum dot with spin-@xmath0 ground state in the coulomb blockade regime as in @xcite , see also fig.[qdot ] .",
    "the quantum dot is subject to a constant magnetic field @xmath1 which leads to a zeeman splitting @xmath2 of the electronic states , where @xmath3 is the electron g factor and @xmath4 the bohr magneton ( throughout this paper we use @xmath5 for gaas and units such that @xmath6 ) .",
    "two leads at chemical potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 are coupled to the dot for charge transport .",
    "further , as in ref .  , we allow for an electron spin resonance ( esr ) field to drive coherent transition between the two spin states .    leaving sources of uncontrollable environmental influences aside for a moment ( see below ) , the total hamiltonian consists of contributions from electrons on the dot , electrons in the leads and a tunneling interaction between dot and leads , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 contains contributions from charging and interaction energies of the electrons on the dot , the interaction energy @xmath11 with the static magnetic field , and the esr - hamiltonian @xmath12 of the interaction of the electron spin with a magnetic field @xmath13 , oscillating linearly in the @xmath14 direction .",

    "finally , the coupling between dot and leads is described by the standard tunneling hamiltonian @xmath24 h.c . , where we denote with @xmath25 a tunneling amplitude and with @xmath26 the annihilation operator of an electron on the dot in orbital state @xmath27 .",
    "following ref .",

    "we assume there is only one electron on the dot . with @xmath28 ,",
    "the electron has the ground state @xmath29 with energy @xmath30 and the exited state @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "if an electron tunnels onto the dot , the two electrons can form the singlet state @xmath33 with energy @xmath34 or either of the three triplet states . as the triplet state @xmath35 has higher energy ( for suitable magnetic field @xcite ) , the singlet @xmath36 is the ground state for two electrons on the dot .",
    "the chemical potentials are chosen such that @xmath37 . under these conditions",
    "the dot can be opened and closed for a sequential tunneling current by a spin flip induced by an esr field:@xcite an electron at chemical potential @xmath7 in the left lead and a dot electron in state @xmath29 do not have sufficient energy to form the singlet state .",
    "if due to an esr induced excitation the dot state is @xmath31 , however , less energy is required and an electron in lead one can tunnel onto the dot to form the singlet state . tunneling onto the dot from lead two is suppressed by several orders of magnitude if the thermal energy is much lower than the energy gap even if the dot electron is in the excited state @xmath31 . at higher temperatures , to assure that the singlet can only be formed with the excited dot electron , one can choose spin - polarized leads .",
    "this may be achieved with several methods , see ref .   and",
    "references therein .",
    "thus , within these constraints we see that the current in lead one is proportional to the probability for the dot being in the excited state , i.e.  @xmath38 , while the current in lead two is proportional to the probability of the dot being in the singlet state , @xmath39 , see ref .  .",
    "the traditional description of the dynamics of the dot is based on a master equation for the reduced density operator of the dot , obtained from the total density matrix @xmath40 by tracing over the degrees of freedom of the leads : @xmath41 $ ] . as usual , we denote matrix elements with @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) and include only the three relevant dot states @xmath44 .",

    "starting from the von neumann equation for the full density operator @xmath46 $ ] , the master equation for @xmath47 was derived in ref .   using standard methods within the markov approximation .",
    "further , we will allow for an arbitrary ( fixed ) phase @xmath48 of the esr field which will play an important role in determining the spin state .    in order to eliminate the explicit time dependence emerging from the esr field",
    ", we here base our analysis on the dot state in a rotating frame , @xmath49 in fact , with the exception of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the corresponding transposed expressions , this transformation leaves almost all matrix elements untouched .    along the lines of the derivation in ref .",

    "these four contributions give rise to the current in the leads and are derived from the underlying hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) .",
    "the rates are @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 where @xmath62^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function of lead @xmath63 .",
    "analogously we define the rates @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 are the transition rates with density of states @xmath72 and tunneling amplitude @xmath73.@xcite in the limit @xmath74 we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which resembles the sequential tunneling from lead one onto the dot and into lead two .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 , because we choose @xmath79 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume equal rates for both leads @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "finally , we set @xmath82 if the leads are not spin - polarized , and @xmath83 , @xmath84 in the case of spin - polarization .",
    "we simulate stochastically all processes that could be observed in principle , but eventually extract the desired information from those quantities that correspond to the specific measurement scheme chosen . quantum transitions between the dot states",
    "may be observed by monitoring the current through the dot , which is the starting point for our quantum trajectory analysis of the following sections .",
    "by contrast , mechanisms for incoherent spin flips ( described by the operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) and dephasing mechanisms ( described by the projectors @xmath87 ) are introduced on phenomenological grounds and not contained in the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) .",
    "the ( phenomenological ) spin flip rates are assumed to satisfy the condition of detailed balance : @xmath88 .",
    "the rates @xmath89 are phenomenological dephasing rates : the effect of an operator @xmath90 in ( [ masterlind ] ) is to kill coherences between state @xmath91 and the remaining states ( at a rate @xmath89 ) , while leaving probabilities unaffected .",
    "if the coupling to the leads is switched off ( by an appropriate choice of the chemical potentials ) , the dynamics as described by the master equation ( [ masterlind ] ) is that of a standard decaying two - state spin - system .",
    "then the corresponding ( intrinsic ) relaxation and decoherence rates turn out to be @xmath92    let us now turn to the dot dynamics : in terms of its coefficients , the time evolution of the dot state @xmath93 given by the master equation ( [ masterlind ] ) reads @xmath94 with the effective rates @xmath95 note that eqs .",

    "( [ rwa1]-[rwa4 ] ) , and the latter are the only ones of relevance to us .",
    "they enable us to determine easily counting statistics of tunneling electrons numerically by means of the quantum trajectory method which we describe in the following sections .",
    "one major motivation behind the development of quantum trajectory methods were experiments with with single quanta . before these developments , naturally , ensemble experiments required simple ensemble theories . matters changed with experiments involving single atoms , electrons or ions in traps . continuously monitoring those systems ,",
    "single quantum jumps became visible to the bare eye .",
    "a theory of continuous quantum measurement taking into account continuous measurement records of the observed environment to update the quantum state accordingly , were developed , mainly with an eye on applications in quantum optics .",
    "experiments on the single quantum level have reached solid state devices , as for instance electrons in quantum dots .",
    "accordingly , the dynamics of such nano - scale quantum systems may be described adequately by quantum trajectories .",
    "in fact , it may well turn out that these methods are even more useful in solid state devices since the sensitivity of electron detectors is typically far better than that for photon detectors , on the single quantum level .",
    "as will be explained in the following , a quantum trajectory @xmath96 describes a subensemble of the full ( ensemble ) density operator @xmath97 , _ conditioned _ on a certain ( stochastic ) measurement record , here detection events at certain times . in this approach",
    "we determine the dynamics of an electron on a quantum dot , conditioned on the measured ( stochastic ) tunneling current through the dot .",
    "quantum trajectory methods have changed remarkably the way we think about open quantum system dynamics . while traditionally an open quantum system is described by its density operator @xmath97 as in the last section ,",
    "quantum trajectories describe open system dynamics taking into account certain continuous , stochastic measurement outcomes . in other words , with quantum trajectories one determines a _ conditioned _ density operator @xmath96 , reflecting knowledge obtained from a continuous monitoring of the environment .",
    "sampling over all these possible measurement records , in other words , ignoring the state of the environment , one recovers the usual full ensemble @xmath97 . we write @xmath98 $ ] where @xmath99 $ ] denotes the ensemble mean over all possible measurement records with corresponding probability ( see below ) .",
    "the principle idea is to monitor the environment rather than ignoring , i.e.   tracing over it . in quantum optics one",
    "tries to detect photons emitted from the quantum system of interest , here we detect electrons in the leads coupled to the quantum dot .    in order to illustrate this approach , we consider a simplified open quantum system  the generalization to the quantum dot case will be obvious .",
    "this model system consists of two levels and is coupled to a continuum of states .",
    "excitation is done by some additional mechanism , included in the hamiltonian of the system @xmath100 .",
    "we start with a master equation of type ( [ masterlind ] ) , and in this model with a single lindblad operator @xmath101 , @xmath102   + \\frac{1}{2 } ( [ l \\rho , l^\\dagger ] + [ l , \\rho l^\\dagger ] ) .\\ ] ] in the following we abbreviate the right hand side of the equation with the superoperator @xmath103 . for concreteness ,",

    "defined , one obtains the _ quantum jump representation _ @xcite of the solution of ( [ masterlind2 ] ) in the form @xmath112 clearly , the solution @xmath97 is a sum ( or integral , respectively ) over any number @xmath27 of emission processes ( number of projections onto @xmath113 due to the application of the jump operator @xmath108 ) , appearing at any times @xmath114 between zero and the current time @xmath115 .",
    "one has to integrate over all corresponding ( unnormalized ) density operators @xmath116 , as apparent from expression ( [ quantumjump ] ) .",
    "thus , one particular _",
    "quantum trajectory _ is the normalized density operator @xmath117 which describes the time evolution of the quantum system _ conditioned _ on the particular measurement record , i.e.  conditioned on the number and times of emission processes .",
    "the quantum trajectory @xmath118 occurs with probability @xmath119 .",
    "the normalized quantum trajectory @xmath96 may be determined directly through the following prescription : at time @xmath120 the new density operator @xmath121 is obtained in one of two ways :    first , the probability @xmath122 , to undergo a quantum jump , i.e.  to emit a quantum during the time interval @xmath123 is equal to the jump rate times the length of the time interval times the probability to be in the excited state : @xmath124tr@xmath125tr@xmath126 . if a quantum is emitted ( and thus detected ) , i.e.  a jump has occurred , the conditioned quantum state is the ground state : @xmath127 .",
    "if however , no jump occurs , the new density operator is given by @xmath128 as is apparent from the representation ( [ quantumjump ] ) .",
    "in practice therefore , a quantum trajectory is obtained by determining a random number @xmath129 between zero and one in each time step @xmath123 : if @xmath130 , we set @xmath131 , if , however @xmath132 , we set @xmath133 . the full ensemble of possible states is thus given by @xmath134 and indeed , one may easily verify that the right hand side equals @xmath135 as expected from the master equation ( [ masterlind2 ] ) for the full ensemble .",
    "this branching may occur at any time step and a thus huge ensemble of different quantum trajectories may be obtained . as mentioned before , the usual reduced density operator is obtained by taking the ensemble mean . in order to obtain counting statistics as in the following sections , we simply average over many runs and",
    "obtain numerically a distribution of jump times as in a real experiment involving a single quantum system .",
    "an electron spin on a quantum dot has been found useful as a memory device or a qubit for quantum information processing .",
    "readout of the spin state through a tunneling current was investigated using a rather restricted parameter regime for which analytical results were obtained in ref .  .",
    "first we want to show , how the analytical results emerge very easily and directly from the quantum trajectory approach .",
    "now we consider a regime where we can neglect spin flips , i.e.  @xmath136 . as in ref .",
    "we choose spin - polarized leads , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 . in the limit @xmath139",
    "we then have @xmath140 .",
    "the initial state is @xmath31 and since no spin flip occurs on the time scale of interest the only processes that happen are transitions between @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "the _ quantum jump representation _ ( [ quantumjump ] ) of this particular solution then reads @xmath141 with @xmath142 and @xmath143 . in the regime",
    "chosen we can write @xmath144 and then get @xmath145 here every operator @xmath146 describes an electron tunneling onto the dot from lead one and @xmath147 represents the hopping of an electron from the dot into lead two .",
    "since the initial state is @xmath31 , the first transition is @xmath148 and with a second transition back to @xmath31 the first electron accumulates in lead two .",
    "a third transition to the singlet does not change the number of electrons in lead two . for a particular @xmath149 ( number of electrons in lead two )",
    "we have to consider @xmath150 and @xmath151 and the ( unnormalized ) density operator for a certain @xmath149 at time @xmath115 is @xmath152 therefore , the probability to find exactly @xmath149 electrons in lead two at time @xmath115 is @xmath153 confirming the findings in ref .  .    with the general quantum jump representation ( [ quantumjump ] )",
    ", we can overcome the limitations of the analytical result , considering arbitrary regimes and investigating the dynamics numerically .",
    "so far , the proposed measurement scheme allows one to deduce the probability to be in either of the two spin states from the current through the dot . a relative phase between @xmath29 and @xmath31 ,",
    "however , can not be detected . in order to measure the full spin state , therefore ,",
    "a tomographical measurement setup is required . here",
    ", the freedom to apply the esr field comes into play .",
    "we show that while applying an esr field , phase - sensitive counting statistics result , leading to clear identification of the qubit state on the bloch sphere . as in quantum optical setups , the full state could also be obtained with appropriate @xmath154-pulses , that effectively change the measurement axis . in this way ,",
    "not only the @xmath155-component as in the original proposal , but also @xmath156 and @xmath157 and thus the full @xmath110 can be measured .",
    "a simpler concept , not involving these precise pulses , is to measure the spin state via counting statistics of a current through the dot in conjunction with a constant esr field as we will show in the following . for this scheme to be successful",
    "it is crucial to control the interaction between dot and leads .",
    "we are not interested in the asymptotic , stationary distribution , but in the typical time between switching the coupling on and the first ( or second , or third and so on ) electron appearing in lead two .",
    "also , it is not necessary to be able to measure the electrons in lead two with a high temporal resolution : one can switch off the coupling between dot and lead two after a certain time @xmath115 and has any time thereafter to collect the electrons in lead two .",
    "we note that different measurement schemes are possible .",
    "since an electron tunneling onto the dot already carries the information about the spin of the dot electron , one could abandon lead two altogether and try to monitor the number of electrons on the quantum dot , e.g.  with a quantum point contact .",
    "our proposal for quantum state tomography could be transferred to other setups as well , as for recent experiments.@xcite    we assume that the dot is in a given initial state at @xmath158 , when the coupling to the leads is switched on",
    ". then we measure the number of electrons tunneling into lead two . according to the quantum trajectory approach",
    "we calculate the evolution of the density matrix .",
    "every jump from @xmath36 to @xmath31 or @xmath29 indicates that an electron tunneled out of the dot . at very low temperatures ,",
    "as assumed throughout this paper , the probability of tunneling into lead two is close to unity , while tunneling into lead one is very unlikely .",
    "a single run of the stochastic evolution will display emission processes , i.e.  contributions to the current , at certain random times .",
    "counting the corresponding number of quanta in lead two as a function of time for a large ensemble of quantum trajectories allows us to determine the probability @xmath159 of finding exactly @xmath149 electrons in lead two at time @xmath115 for a given initial state of the dot .",
    "such counting distributions are displayed in the following figures .",
    "we stress again that experimentally , it is not required to be able to measure these arrival times with a high resolution .",
    "one simply switches off the coupling between dot and lead two after a given time @xmath115 .",
    "then one has any time to determine the number of electrons in lead two .",
    "our numerical procedure can be applied to any parameter values and any time dependence of the driving esr field . for the regime chosen in ref .",

    "an average over all possible phases would indeed lead to the graph of the fully mixed state , irrespective of the phase @xmath174 of the initial quantum state .",
    "we close this section by pointing out that also higher order counting statistics ( @xmath187 ) display state - sensitive behaviour  if only less pronounced .",
    "this is quite obvious since a delayed first tunneling event shifts the starting time for the following electrons . for @xmath186 , the difference between the counting statistics for various initial states is well pronounced . in this latter case , however , the curves do not cross which diminishes the distinguishability of states and the best choice for that is @xmath188 . as displayed in fig .",

    ", our results suggest that spin polarization is not required for those  not even advantageous , in fact . in fig .",
    "[ equatormsp ] we display counting statistics @xmath166 for spin - polarized leads ( only spin - up electrons in the leads , i.e.  @xmath84 ) .",
    "we notice only marginal differences compared to the case of unpolarized leads ( fig .",
    "[ equatorosp ] ) .    for large times , it is more likely to observe precisely one electron in the case of unpolarized leads .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is the fact that for unpolarized leads , there is also the possibility that the spin - up electron on the dot ( rather than the spin - down electron entering the dot ) may tunnel out of the dot .",
    "then the dot is in the ground state and therefore closed for the tunneling of another electron .",
    "it is only after the esr field had time to populate the excited state that a second electron may tunnel through the dot .",
    "in fact , it turns out that this mechanism is the preferred tunneling event : for the parameters of fig .",

    ", one can easily see the effect of decoherence and relaxation . in the series of graphs in fig .",
    "[ wscan ] we show counting statistics for the @xmath31 and @xmath29-state , for the full mixture and for two coherent superpositions ( states on the equator of the bloch sphere ) .",
    "clearly , for large tunneling rate ( left graph , ( a ) ) , all states may be distinguished .",
    "the third graph ( c ) shows a regime where decoherence has fully set in : while the states @xmath31 and @xmath29-state remain essentially unaffected , the counting statistics of the coherent superpositions collapse onto the curve of the full mixture . in other words , while no relaxation has set in yet , coherences between the states @xmath31 and @xmath29 have disappeared . decreasing the tunneling rate even further , counting statistics finally reveal the relaxation time : eventually , the initial states @xmath31 and @xmath29 may no longer be distinguished , i.e.  the relaxation has taken place .",
    "measurement of a variety of states ( @xmath29 , @xmath31 , coherent superposition ) facilitates an estimate of @xmath195 and @xmath194.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "counting statistics was used in ref .   to determine the measurement time and measurement efficiency . it was shown that after about ten times the tunneling time , the spin state on the dot could be determined to be either @xmath29 or @xmath31 with close to 100% efficiency , even if only a single measurement is made ( provided it was either @xmath29 or @xmath31 ) .",
    "crucially , these results are based on spin - polarized leads . without spin - polarization",
    "the determination of the dot state with a single measurement appears problematic .",
    "the reason is that an electron may tunnel from the quantum dot back into lead one rather than into lead two .",
    "in fact , since in the case of unpolarized leads there are three ways for an electron to leave the dot : it may tunnel from lead one onto the dot and further into lead two ( transition @xmath196 ) or the electrons interchange the roles and the one residing on the dot tunnels into either of the two leads ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "the latter two possibilities are almost of same probability and therefore with a probability of about one third a tunneling process has taken place without having been observed in lead two . in other words , with a probability of two thirds only we can claim that without detecting an electron in lead two after sufficient time the spin state on the dot was @xmath29 .    in order to overcome this problem we propose to measure the number of electrons on the dot with a quantum point contact and recent experiments @xcite",
    "show that such a concept may work .",
    "if an electron tunnels onto the dot it confirms that the state was @xmath31 and if it stays there sufficiently long the qpc as electrometer recognizes the charge . since the projection takes place",
    "if an electron tunnels onto the dot , the second lead could even be omitted and then the dot electron would tunnel into lead one . for clarity in the following argument , however , we do not change our setup and leave lead two as before .    with the help of the qpc it is possible to measure the state of a single electron spin with an efficiency of almost 100% after about ten times the tunneling time , as for polarized leads as shown in fig .",
    "[ proj_nc ] .",
    "note that for this scheme to work , it is important that the time resolution of the point contact measurement has to be better than the inverse tunneling rate @xmath198 to ensure the detection of the tunneled electron on the dot .",
