    "recent experimental evidence suggests that the cooper pairs in superconducting sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 are triplets with @xmath1-wave internal symmetry , as in the case of superfluid @xmath5he @xcite .",
    "one of characteristic features of this exotic state is the strong influence of impurities on its superconducting properties .",
    "studies of the electronic structure in sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 @xcite have identified an extended van hove singularity close to the fermi energy @xmath6 . in this note",
    "we investigate the interplay between the van hove singularity and disorder in a model @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "we consider a simple extended hubbard hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath7 where as usual @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fermion creation and annihilation operators for an electron on site @xmath10 with spin @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the number operator and @xmath13 is the chemical potential .",
    "disorder is introduced into the problem by allowing the local site energy @xmath14 to vary randomly from site to site with equal probability .",
    "@xmath15 is the attractive interaction ( @xmath16 ) between nearest sites and @xmath17 is the hopping integral from site @xmath18 to site @xmath10 which takes nonzero values between nearest and next nearest sites . in @xmath19space : @xmath20 where the hopping parameter @xmath21 as well as the band filling @xmath22 were fitted to the experimental cyclotron masses and corresponding carriers occupations for the @xmath23 band of sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 , the interaction @xmath24 was chosen to get @xmath25k @xcite .",
    "the linearized gap equation for the critical temperature @xmath0 of p - wave pairing from the hamiltionian ( [ eq1 ] ) reads @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an averaged electron green function which defines the weighted density of states ( dos ) of @xmath1-wave electron states @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a coherent potential which describe the electron self energy in the disordered system .    in case of a clean system ( @xmath31 )",
    "we get a conventional gap equation with the dos @xmath32 substituted by @xmath33 under the integral ( eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ) . in fig 1a",
    "we show @xmath32 and @xmath34 for the clean system .",
    "note that the van hove singularity in @xmath32 produces the maximum in @xmath34 .",

    "the full influence of disorder on @xmath38 is illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig2]a is degradated strongly with disorder .",

    "when the fermi energy is close to a van hove singularity relatively weak disorder can cause very rapid @xmath0 degradation in a @xmath1-wave superconductor . the case of sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 may be an example of this phenomenon ."
