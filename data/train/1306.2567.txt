    "the bond variations of w(co)@xmath0 and co@xmath2(co)@xmath3 adsorbed on fully hydroxylated surfaces indicate uniform fluctuations ( w@xmath22c and c@xmath22o bonds ) on either side ( i.e , oriented towards the surface and the vacuum ) of the molecule . on the contrary ,",
    "the relative bond values of w(co)@xmath1 on partially hydroxylated surfaces show non - uniform variations indicating that certain bonds ( i.e. , w@xmath22c bonds oriented towards the vacuum and the co bonds towards the substrate ) experience larger changes than others .",
    "thus , for favorable conditions , the bond between c and o for the co bonded to the surface might cleave leaving the surface si atoms terminated with oxygens . this situation is not observed in the present md simulations but the higher ratio of carbon contamination with respect to oxygen ( before atmospheric air exposure ) in the ebid - obtained samples might provide an evidence for such a fact.@xcite similarly , we found in the case of co@xmath2(co)@xmath3 on partially hydroxylated surfaces , that surface oxygen atoms are involved in bonding to the dissociated surface species .",
    "this suggests that the removal of oxygen components from the deposits might not be an easy task to achieve .",
    "presence of oxygen contamination is also expected to occur as a result of exposure of ebid deposits to the air .",
    "thus the composition of the ebid deposits are determined to a large extent by the number of available active si sites ( alternatively the degree of hydroxylation ) , the frequency of these precursor molecules approaching such a site and the exposure time to the environments .",
    "furthermore , the surface defects observed in sio@xmath2 during the interaction of co(co)@xmath4 with partially hydroxylated surfaces might also act as an active site for activating the approaching precursor molecule that could account for the facile dissociation of co@xmath2(co)@xmath3 on sio@xmath2.@xcite    on partially hydroxylated surfaces our results for both w(co)@xmath0 and co@xmath2(co)@xmath3 show that the fragmented species remain localized , thus blocking active sites on the surface .",

    "the fragmented species retain the chemisorbed character on the surface and we do not observe any reformation of the parent precursor moiety , but instead a slight tendency towards fragmentation .",
    "we also observe a smaller weakening of the surface - oriented co bonds compared to vacuum - oriented co bonds in w(co)@xmath0 and co@xmath2(co)@xmath3 on partially hydroxylated surfaces .",

    "<S> tungsten and cobalt carbonyls adsorbed on a substrate are typical starting points for the electron beam induced deposition of tungsten or cobalt based metallic nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> we employ first principles molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics and vibrational spectra of w(co)@xmath0 and w(co)@xmath1 as well as co@xmath2(co)@xmath3 and co(co)@xmath4 precursor molecules on fully and partially hydroxylated silica surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> such surfaces resemble the initial conditions of electron beam induced growth processes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both w(co)@xmath0 and co@xmath2(co)@xmath3 are stable at room temperature and mobile on a silica surface saturated with hydroxyl groups ( oh ) , moving up to half an angstrm per picosecond . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , chemisorbed w(co)@xmath1 or co(co)@xmath4 ions at room temperature do not change their binding site . </S>",
    "<S> these results contribute to gaining fundamental insight into how the molecules behave in the simulated time window of 20  ps and our determined vibrational spectra of all species provide signatures for experimentally distinguishing the form in which precursors cover a substrate . </S>"
