    "there are several mesons with exotic quantum numbers ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) listed in the review of particle physics @xcite .",
    "it is appropriate to pay special attention on these mesons because they can not be accommodated in the conventional quark model . in recent years",
    ", studies of their possible structures have become an important focus in hadronic physics . for @xmath0 mesons ,",
    "two possible structures have been studied in the literature : four - quark states @xcite and hybrid states @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on studies of the @xmath0 state ) .",
    "the possible hybrid structures of @xmath0 mesons have been studied by using many different methods , including flux - tube model , lattice qcd and qcd sum rules .",
    "the qcd sum rules method ( qcdsr ) is a very important nonperturbative method in hadronic physics . since it was introduced by shifman et al .",
    "@xcite , qcd sum rules have given numerous predictions on hadron properties @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been argued that there are some shortcomings in traditional qcd sum rule analysis methodologies ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . mainly , the continuum threshold @xmath5 could not be completely constrained in the framework of traditional qcd sum rules , which causes a significant uncertainty .",
    "this shortcoming is reflected in many works , especially in the case of @xmath6 , where many qcdsr works gave the  right \" predictions @xcite , however , the signals of @xmath6 are in fact statistical fluctuation effects rather than true resonances @xcite . to overcoming these shortcomings , leinweber introduced a new monte - carlo based uncertainty analysis into qcd sum rules and re - studied the @xmath7 meson and nucleon @xcite .",
    "later , this procedure was used for predicting the decuplet baryon spectrum @xcite , nucleon axial vector coupling constants @xcite and hadron magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "all these studies are fruitful .",
    "recently , a mathematica package mathqcdsr was provided @xcite to facilitate the uncertainty analysis .    in this paper , we restudy the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 light hybrids by using qcd sum rules with leinweber s monte - carlo based uncertainty analysis .",
    "we first provide the operator product expansion results for correlators of the relevant light hybrid currents followed by a brief introduction to the monte - carlo based qcd sum rules analysis .",
    "after that , the masses for @xmath0 and @xmath1 light hybrids are discussed respectively .",
    "finally , we give a summary and some further discussion .",
    "the current @xmath8 can annihilate both @xmath0 and @xmath1 states . to predict the properties of these associated states in qcd sum rules ,",
    "the relevant two - point correlator is necessary . in the present case",
    ", it can be written as @xmath9 where the current @xmath10 is the renormalized current . in the qcd sum rules formulation ,",
    "we focus on the operator product expand ( ope ) of the invariant correlators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which correspond to the contributions from @xmath0 and @xmath1 states respectively .",
    "after borel transformation , they can be written as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the euler s constant , @xmath15 is the borel - transform parameter and we use @xmath16 as the borel transformation of @xmath17 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 in for the isospin",
    "@xmath19 state @xmath0 state are as follows @xcite @xmath20 while for @xmath1 state ( @xmath19 ) , they can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the running coupling constant for three flavors .    in order to obtain predictions for the ground state ,",
    "the simple single narrow resonance spectral density ansatz @xmath23 is typically used , where @xmath5 is the continuum threshold that separating the contribution from excited states ( esc ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the coupling of the resonance to the current and the mass of the resonance respectively .",
    "based on this assumption , we can obtain the phenomenological representation of the correlator @xmath26 via the dispersion relation @xcite . the spectral density for excited states @xmath27 can be chosen as @xmath28 , and following usual conventions , these contributions are placed on the ope side of the sum rules . for the present case ,",
    "we obtain @xmath29\\\\ & + b_{11}\\frac{-1}{\\tau}(1-\\rho_0(s_0\\tau))+b_{12}\\left [ \\frac{2}{\\tau}(\\gamma_e+\\ln(\\tau\\mu^2))+ 2 f_2(s_0,\\tau)\\right]\\\\ & + c_{11}+c_{12}(-\\gamma_e-\\ln(\\tau\\mu^2)-e_1(s_0\\tau ) ) + d_{11}\\tau , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the exponential integral function , and the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as follows @xmath34,\\\\ f_2(s_0,\\tau)=\\frac{1}{\\tau}[e_1(s_0\\tau)+\\rho_0(s_0\\tau)\\ln(s_0/\\mu^2)].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    after placing the contribution of excited states to the ope side of the correlator , the sum rule can be written as @xmath35 this is the master equation for qcd sum rules ; physical properties of relevant hadrons , i.e. , @xmath25 , @xmath36 and @xmath5 , should satisfy eq .  .    finally , before proceeding with numerical calculations , renormalization - group ( rg ) improvement of the sum rules , i.e. , substitutions @xmath37 in eq .",
    ", is needed @xcite .",
    "in addition , the anomalous dimensions for condensate @xmath38 in @xmath39 also should be implemented by multiplying @xmath38 by a factor @xmath40 , where @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 is the renormalization scale for @xmath38 , and @xmath43 is the anomalous dimension for condensate @xmath38 . however , most condensates appear in eq .",
    "are rg - invariant ( e.g. , @xmath44 ) or approximately rg - invariant ( e.g. , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) ; the only two condensates which should be multiplied by factor @xmath40 are @xmath47 and @xmath48 whose anomalous dimensions are -23/27 and 10/27 respectively @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath24 also should be multiplied by factor @xmath49 , where @xmath50 to incorporate the anomalous dimension of the current @xcite ; @xmath24 then receives its value at hybrid mass shell .",
    "the main purpose of qcd sum rules is to obtain predictions of the lowest - lying resonance mass and coupling constant . in traditional qcd sum rules ,",
    "the prediction of resonance mass can be obtained by ratio method @xcite , i.e. , @xmath51 , but this approach has some obvious shortcomings @xcite , especially , fixing of @xmath5 by hand . in order to address these shortcomings ,",
    "leinweber introduced a monte - carlo based uncertainty analysis into qcd sum rules .    obviously , because of the truncation of ope and the simplified assumption for the phenomenological spectral density , eq .",
    "is not valid for all @xmath15 , thus requiring a sum rule window in which the validity of eq .   can be established . specifically , to ensure convergence of the ope @xcite",
    ", the contributions of the highest dimensional operators ( hdo ) in ope should not be too large ( less than 10% of total ope contributions ) , that will give an upper bound @xmath52 for the sum rule window .",
    "meanwhile , the continuum contributions should not be larger than the pole contributions , otherwise we can not rely on the single narrow resonance ansatz .",
    "demanding that the ratio of esc / total contributions @xmath53 50% gives the lower bound @xmath54 .",
    "however , esc is dependent on @xmath5 , which is to be determined in qcd sum rule analysis , thus we can not determine @xmath54 before doing the qcd sum rule analysis . in practice , we will initially  guess \" a @xmath54 , and after finishing the analysis we can check our initial choice and adjust it iteratively until it is consistent with the results of the analysis .",
    "the least - square method is appropriate for matching the two sides of eq . in the sum rule window .",
    "however , the condensates appearing in ope are not known accurately , so these parameter uncertainties will lead to uncertainties in the ope . because the uncertainties in the ope are not equal at different points in the sum rule window , a weighted - least - square method is more appropriate .",
    "following leinweber s procedure , we first need to estimate the standard deviation @xmath55 of @xmath56 at any point @xmath15 in the sum rule window .",
    "this can be done by randomly generating 200 set of gaussian distributed input parameters ( condensates and @xmath57 ) with given uncertainties .",
    "200 samples are enough to establish the stable standard deviation . after obtaining @xmath55 ,",
    "the phenomenological output parameters @xmath5 , @xmath36 and @xmath25 can be obtained by minimizing a weighted @xmath58 , which is defined as follows @xmath59 the points @xmath60 are selected to be @xmath61 , i.e. , we divide the sum rule window into ( @xmath62 ) evenly parts . in the @xmath0 light hybrid case",
    ", we find the fitting results do not change provided @xmath63 , thus we set @xmath64 for simplicity .    in this paper , we generate a set of 2000 gaussian distributed input parameters with given uncertainties , and for each set we minimize @xmath58 to obtain a set of fitted phenomenological output parameters . finally , we will select the physical results ( it is natural that there exist constraints between output parameters , such as @xmath65 etc , and results that violate these constraints should be excluded ) from the set of fitted values .",
    "an uncertainty analysis of phenomenological output parameters is then possible .",
    "in addition , scatter plots of input and output parameters allow us to study correlations between them , and these studies can shed some light on how to improve the accuracy of the analysis .",
    "to randomly generate gaussian distribution input parameters , we first set the central values and uncertainties of these parameters . in this paper , we treat all condensates as independent parameters in order to distinguish the importance of different condensates . after reviewing the literature , we choose the central value of input parameters at @xmath66gev as follows @xcite @xmath67 then all sets of input parameters are generated with 10% uncertainties , which is a typical uncertainty in qcdsr . for physical considerations , we add an additional constraint @xmath68 on @xmath57 .",
    "any set of randomly generated input parameters which violates this constraint will be excluded from our set of input parameters .",
    "the histogram of @xmath0 light hybrid masses obtained from 2000 matches . ]    after several numerical samples , we find the appropriate sum rule window for the @xmath0 light hybrid is @xmath69 . by minimizing the @xmath58 function for each sample of input parameters ,",
    "we finally obtain a 2000-member set of phenomenological output parameters which satisfy our physical constraints . in fig.[fig : mhistogram ] , we plot the histogram for these 2000 different @xmath0 light hybrid masses obtained in the least - squares fitting procedure .",
    "it is obvious that the distribution of @xmath25 is very close to a gaussian .",
    "the least - squares fit of the @xmath0 light hybrid with the median value for @xmath36 , @xmath25 , @xmath5 and all condensates .",
    "the error bars show @xmath70 estimated at each @xmath60 , and the factor @xmath49 is absorbed in @xmath24 . ]",
    "the main results of our fitting procedure are as follows @xmath71 where we have reported the median and the asymmetric standard deviations from the median @xcite for all physical output parameters .    the uncertainty of @xmath25 is less than 6% , implying that the fitted results are very stable with different input parameters .",
    "fig.[fig : fit ] illustrates that the fits are qualitatively acceptable , and from fig.[fig : srwin ] we demonstrate that the two conditions for determining the sum rule window are met very well for the median value of phenomenological parameters .",
    "sum rule window for the @xmath0 light hybrid .",
    "the dotted line denotes the relative excited states contributions while the dashed line denotes the relative hdo contributions . ]     the scatter plot of @xmath0 light hybrid mass and the continuum threshold . ]     the scatter plot of @xmath0 light hybrid mass and two - gluon condensate . ]     the scatter plot of @xmath0 light hybrid mass and four - quark condensate . ]     the scatter plot of @xmath0 light hybrid mass and @xmath57 . ]",
    "based on the results of our least - squares fits , the correlations of the input and output parameters can also be obtained . from the scatter plot fig .",
    "[ fig : s0 m ] we find that there exists a very strong positive correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath5 that may explain why a broad range of @xmath25 can occur in traditional sum rule analyses by setting an appropriate @xmath5 @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : magg ] we find that there exists a weak negative correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath44 ; the wilson coefficient and the value for @xmath72 are thus crucial to our results .",
    "further study should improve the present understanding on this point .",
    "furthermore , we find there exists weak positive correlations between @xmath25 and four - quark condensate , and for @xmath57 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : mqqqq ] and [ fig : mlambda ] ) . thus the wilson coefficient and possible factorization violation effects for the four - quark condensate also play an important role in the result .",
    "it is somewhat unexpected that the present result is sensitive to @xmath57 in contrast to the @xmath7 meson case @xcite .",
    "the possible explanation may come from the fact that the leading term of ope is @xmath73-dependent and the anomalous dimension is not zero in the current .",
    ".[tab : result ] matching results with larger uncertainties for input parameters .",
    "all matching results with @xmath74 or @xmath75 are excluded .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we may also want to estimate how the result will change if the uncertainties for input parameters are larger than 10% .",
    "table  [ tab : result ] shows that the uncertainties for @xmath72 , @xmath46 and @xmath57 play the most important roles in the least - squares fit results , i.e. , the uncertainties of output parameters are mainly determined by these three input parameters .",
    "table  [ tab : result ] also demonstrates that the medians of @xmath36 and @xmath25 change a little while @xmath5 is somewhat sensitive to larger uncertainties for input parameters .",
    "it probably means that the continuum absorbs these uncertainties in some way .",
    "finally , if we want to improve the simplified single narrow resonance spectral density , we may use a breit - wigner form ( @xmath76 ) spectral density instead , this modification replaces @xmath77 in eq .   with @xmath78 -\\frac{1}{\\pi}{\\rm im}\\left[{\\mathrm{e}}^{-m^2 \\tau+{\\mathrm{i}}\\ , m\\gamma\\tau}{\\rm ei}(m^2\\tau - s_0\\tau-{\\mathrm{i}}\\ , m\\gamma\\tau)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the width of the resonance and ei is an exponential integral function",
    ". however , a four parameter fit ( @xmath25 , @xmath36 , @xmath5 and @xmath79 ) search always give the same result as the three parameter fit ( @xmath25 , @xmath36 and @xmath5 ) , i.e. , gives a result with @xmath80 automatically .",
    "if we set a  reasonable \" non - zero @xmath79 as input , then a three parameter fit ( @xmath25 , @xmath36 and @xmath5 ) will give a result with a slightly increased value for the predicted mass .",
    "however , in the present case , the weighted @xmath58 will increase significantly , implying that the goodness of fit with non - zero @xmath79 is worse than with @xmath80 .",
    "this situation not only occurs in the hybrid , we have checked that it also occurs for the @xmath7 meson .",
    "these specific results are in agreement with the general argument presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the procedure of @xmath1 light hybrid does not give a result as good as the @xmath0 case . because of the sign of the @xmath72 in ope , it is more difficult to find an appropriate sum rule window for @xmath1 case .",
    "we can only find a small sum - rule region of validity , @xmath81 , for the @xmath1 case .",
    "the small sum rule window may reduce the reliability of the least - squares fit result . because the @xmath1 quantum numbers are non - exotic , it is possible that mixing of the hybrid with @xmath82 and gluonic currents is needed to study the scalar channels . based on mixing of hybrid charmonium and molecular systems , the large mass of this @xmath1 hybrid does not preclude the possibility of a mixed interpretation @xcite .",
    "we also notice that the uncertainties of phenomenological output parameters ( obtained by generating input parameters with 10% uncertainties ) @xmath83 are larger than in the @xmath0 hybrid case .",
    "the correlations also are different with the @xmath0 case ; there now exist positive correlations between @xmath25 and @xmath84 , and negative correlations between @xmath25 and @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath46 condensate is not important in the present case .",
    "in this paper , we have reanalyzed the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light hybrids from qcd sum rules with a monte - carlo based uncertainty analysis . in this procedure , the continuum threshold @xmath5 now is an output rather than an input parameter , and thus we avoid some subjective factors .",
    "based on the uncertainties of our least - squares fit results , we conclude that a reliable mass prediction has been obtained for the @xmath0 light hybrid mass . input parameters with 10% uncertainties cause about only 6% uncertainty in the mass , while 30% uncertainties cause about 13% uncertainty in the mass .",
    "we choose the latter as a cautious estimate , thus we predict the mass of the @xmath0 light hybrid is @xmath85gev .",
    "this result favors @xmath3 to be a hybrid , but @xmath86 is not completely excluded because some input parameters may have larger uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath36 seems much larger , but it could be easily understood by re - parameterizing @xmath87 .",
    "then , the uncertainty of new decay constant @xmath88 is as small as the uncertainty of @xmath25 ( input parameters with 10% uncertainties cause about 6% uncertainty in @xmath89 ) .",
    "we also investigate the sum rules with a breit - wigner form spectral density .",
    "we find the best fit to the sum rules gives a result with @xmath80 .",
    "it is really a surprising result but it is not in isolation ; we have checked it is also true for the @xmath7 meson . obviously , the procedure is not sensitive to the decay width at present .",
    "how to obtain a non - zero decay width needs to be further studied . in principle",
    ", this method can be extended to study excited states , although some new assumptions are necessary .",
    "for instance , if we assume @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the next excited state @xcite , then the predicted mass of the first excited @xmath0 hybrid is about 3gev .",
    "the uncertainties of output parameters for the @xmath1 light hybrid are larger than the @xmath0 case , thus the results are less reliable . according to our result , if @xmath1 pure light hybrid state exists , its mass will be heavier than any known @xmath4 meson .",
    "further experiment or mixted scenarios containing a hybrid component may address this question .    in conclusion ,",
    "the qcd sum rule uncertainties arise not only from ope truncation and the single resonance assumption , but also from sensitivity to the uncertainties of input parameters .",
    "so any corrections , higher order @xmath73 to the coefficients of the condensates or higher dimension contributions would be valuable .",
    "by contrast , the decay width of the light hybrid is below the sensitivity of the present method , and hence the qcd sum - rules analysis is not dependent on the form of the spectral density .",
