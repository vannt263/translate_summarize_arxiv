    "plasma temperatures in the range 10200 ev can be difficult to measure because at those temperatures thermal emission is in the vacuum uv and soft x - ray bands and is strongly absorbed by matter .",
    "this problem is acute if the plasma is surrounded by cold dense matter .",
    "for example , opaque cold dense metallic imploding liners may be used to compress and heat plasmas , with the ultimate goal of thermonuclear fusion @xcite .",
    "we consider the problem of measuring plasma temperatures in the approximate range 10200 ev if radiation from the plasma is not directly observable . at these temperatures",
    "the very soft x - rays of thermal emission are strongly absorbed by most substances ( including vacuum windows , for example ) , so that this circumstance may be frequently encountered .",
    "if the plasma contains a suitable admixture of deuterium and tritium , comparison of the rate of the d(d,@xmath1he)n reaction , producing 2.45 mev neutrons , to that of the d(t,@xmath2)n reaction , producing 14.1 mev neutrons , may permit the determination of the temperature .",
    "the ratio of these reaction rates is significantly dependent on temperature .",
    "the steep increase of both reaction rates with increasing temperature in this regime implies that the temperature determined is that of the highest temperature encountered in the system , even though that may be found in only a small fraction of its volume .",
    "it is also insensitive to other parameters such as the volume and density at peak temperature and the confinement time .",
    "determining plasma temperature by comparison of dd and dt reactions in this low temperature regime involves some special problems .",
    "because of the extreme sensitivity of the reaction rates to temperature , the total number of neutrons produced may be small .",
    "in addition , it may not be predictable even in order of magnitude because small uncertainties in the temperature correspond to great uncertainties in the reaction rates .",
    "the small number of expected neutrons requires that detectors be close to the source , and sources produced by , for example , comparatively massive imploding liners may have long lifetimes . for these reasons the usual method of discriminating neutrons of different energy , their times of flight , may not be feasible . after examining this issue",
    ", this paper discusses other methods .",
    "discrimination based on the ability of the more energetic dt neutrons to excite the 4.44 mev state of @xmath3c and on the greater elastic scattering cross - section of lower energy neutrons in hydrogen may be the most feasible method .",
    "a detector design is outlined , a figure of merit defined , and quantitative simulation results are presented .    because this method depends on the thermonuclear reaction rates ,",
    "these are shown in figure [ reactrate ] for @xmath4 kev . at these temperatures",
    "the nonresonant expressions given by @xcite are valid , and the figure extends to lower temperatures than are usually shown .",
    "it is also necessary to include the effects of electron screening @xcite , which increases the reaction rates at the lowest temperatures considered by several orders of magnitude at high , but plausible , densities .",
    "maxwell - averaged reaction rate coefficients @xcite , showing their steep dependence on temperature at low temperature .",
    "electron shielding @xcite in weak and intermediate regimes is included for an assumed density of 100 gm / cm@xmath1 , as in some inertial fusion targets.,width=384 ]    figure [ reactratio ] shows the ratio of the dt to the dd reaction rates and the logarithmic derivative @xmath6 of the dt reaction rate with respect to temperature ( the result for the dd rate is very similar ) .",
    "for comparatively low ( @xmath7ev ) temperatures the ratio of the fluence of dt to dd neutrons unambiguously determines the temperature in the reaction region , independent of any other parameter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ reactratio ] .",
    "ratio of dt to dd reaction rates and logarithmic derivative of the dt rate with respect to temperature.,width=384 ]",
    "at low temperatures the number of neutrons produced is small .",
    "the usual method of determining source temperatures from the width of the arrival time distribution at a detector of neutrons produced by a single reaction is difficult or impossible , partly because the weak source requires a detector close to it , reducing the spread of arrival times , partly because low temperatures reduce that spread further , and most importantly because of the poor statistics when only a small number of neutrons are detected .",
    "for example , at a distance of 1 m and a source temperature of 100 ev the @xmath8 half - width of the arrival time distribution of dt neutrons is 23 ps , while that of dd neutrons is 147 ps .",
    "these widths are the flight times multiplied by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total mass of the reactants , @xmath11 the neutron velocity , @xmath12 the neutron energy and @xmath13 the sum of the atomic numbers of the reactants . for the dt reaction this is 0.0012 , while for the dd reaction",
    "it is 0.0032 ; if the source is distributed over a region whose size is this fraction of the distance to the detector ( 1.2 mm and 3.2 mm , respectively , for dt and dd reactions at 1 m distance ) then the variation in path lengths will wash out any information about the source temperature obtainable from time of flight .",
    "the difference in time of flight between 2.45 mev ( dd ) and 14.1 mev ( dt ) neutrons is much larger , and if both reactions occur might be used to distinguish these two populations and to infer the temperature from the ratio of their reaction rates . at 1 m",
    "range the 14.1 mev dt neutrons arrive after 19 ns , while the 2.45 mev dd neutrons arrive after 46 ns , a lag of 27 ns .",
    "this interval is measurable with plastic scintillators whose response times may be 210 ns . however , separation by time of flight , even into 2.45 and 14.1 mev energy groups , is possible only if the source duration is less than the interval between the arrivals of 14.1 mev and 2.45 mev neutrons .",
    "if the source duration is comparable to or greater than this interval , as in imploding liner experiments in which neutrons may be emitted over a time @xmath14ns @xcite , another method of discrimination is required .      for sources with long ( @xmath15ns ) durations at a distance @xmath16 ( in m ) discrimination of dt from dd neutrons is not possible by time of flight alone , even for an ideal detector .",
    "discrimination on the basis of the energy deposited could be possible , provided the detector were segmented so that @xmath17 neutron interacts in each segment .",
    "this would require @xmath18 segments , where @xmath19 is the total number of detected neutrons .",
    "if the fluences were approximately predictable , the segment sizes could be chosen to keep @xmath19 in a feasible range .    to determine the ratio of dt to dd neutrons to a fractional accuracy @xmath20 at @xmath21 standard deviations significance , for the optimal case in which this ratio is @xmath22 , requires @xmath23 for @xmath24 (",
    "even though the reaction rates are very sensitive to temperature their ratio is not ) and @xmath25 we find @xmath26 .",
    "the number of discrete segments must be comparable ( the large ratio of energy between the two neutron groups permits some discrimination even when two or three neutrons are detected in a single segment )",
    ".    this might be feasible ( if the plastic scintillator were a bundle of fibers , each optically coupled to a single pixel in an imager that may have @xmath27 pixels ) , provided that the flux is predictable to a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "if not predictable , as is likely when source temperatures are low because of the extreme temperature sensitivity of the reaction rates , either too few neutrons would be detected for statistical significance or too many . in a segment in which @xmath29mev is deposited",
    "it would not be possible to distinguish a number of 14.1 mev neutrons from several times that number of 2.45 mev neutrons .",
    "dt neutrons may activate nuclei that can not be activated by the lower energy dd neutrons .",
    "a promising candidate , on account of its cross - section , half - life and detectability of the product , is the @xmath30al(n,@xmath2)@xmath31na reaction with a threshold of 3.25 mev .",
    "detection would require rapid processing ( the half - life of @xmath31na is only 15 hours , while those of most other candidate targets are even shorter ) of large quantities of material .",
    "the cross - section for this reaction at 14.1 mev is about 0.12 b , while the total scattering cross section is about 1.75 b and inelastic scattering ( @xmath30al has low - lying states at 0.844 mev and 1.014 mev and many more states above 2 mev ) has a cross - section of about 0.4 b at 14.1 mev , and somewhat greater at energies between 2 and 10 mev . in a thick al slab the fraction of incident neutrons producing activation is no more than 10% ; even though energy loss by recoil in elastic scattering is small ( roughly 1/27 of the neutron s incident energy ) , energetic neutrons lose energy rapidly by inelastic scattering .",
    "a thick slab must have a column density @xmath32g/@xmath33 ( thickness @xmath34 cm ) , a mass of hundreds of kg for a 1 sterad activation target at a distance of 1 m from the source .",
    "the total activation efficiency , allowing for solid angle and the cross - sections , is then @xmath35 .",
    "this massive slab of al must be dissolved and a handful of @xmath31na nuclei efficiently separated ( perhaps by reprecipitation of the al and extraction of na from the supernatant ) in a few hours , and their decay gamma rays efficiently counted .",
    "although a conceivable means of detecting yields @xmath36 of dt neutrons , and of measuring yields @xmath37@xmath38 neutrons with useful accuracy , this would be cumbersome .",
    "dt neutrons ( 14.1 mev ) may produce prompt @xmath39-rays by inelastic scattering to levels that can not be reached by scattering of the 2.45 mev neutrons of dd reactions .",
    "carbon is a uniquely favorable target because both its stable isotopes have thresholds for excitation above 2.45 mev ( for other elements , even oxygen , some isotope has a lower excitation threshold ) and for its ready availability and convenience .",
    "a scintillator shielded by hydrogenous material would detect the @xmath39-rays .",
    "a possible design is shown in fig .",
    "[ dtdddetector ] .",
    "the first slab ( closest to the source ) is made of graphite . for a 14.1 mev neutron the cross - section @xmath40 for excitation of the first excited state , which is followed by emission of a 4.44 mev @xmath39-ray , is 0.21 b. this process competes with the total cross - section @xmath41 of 1.32 b. neutron transport is complicated , but for the purposes of an analytic estimate we make the ( conservative ) approximation that the incident neutron flux is exponentially attenuated at the rate @xmath42/cm , where for a graphite density of 2.16 gm / cm@xmath1 @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "this ignores excitation by scattered neutrons , whose energy remains well above the excitation threshold even after @xmath45(10 ) elastic scatterings ( @xmath40 is roughly constant in the range 614 mev ) , although inelastic scattering into the @xmath46 channel at energies above 7.89 mev , included in @xmath41 , reduces the excitation by scattered neutrons .",
    "the neutron to gamma - ray conversion rate @xmath47/cm , and 4.44 mev gamma rays are attenuated in graphite at a rate @xmath48/cm ( @xmath49 b , essentially the compton scattering cross - section ) .",
    "we make a one - stream approximation but allow for the fact that half of the emitted gamma rays are directed backwards by using @xmath50 , and take the attenuation coefficient for gamma rays at the mean angle to the normal of an isotropic distribution ( @xmath51 ) : @xmath52 .",
    "the latter approximation is conservative because attenuation collimates the gamma ray flux into small angles to the slab normals with an effective attenuation coefficient close to @xmath2 rather than @xmath53 . the gamma ray flux at a depth @xmath54 into the graphite slab @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the incident 14.1 mev neutron flux .",

    "it need not be high purity , and ( unlike an aluminum activation target ) may be reused indefinitely without processing .",
    "graphite has a scattering cross section to 2.45 mev neutrons of 1.59 b , so that their unscattered flux is attenuated at a rate @xmath60/cm and the flux that emerges unscattered from a slab of thickness @xmath61 is @xmath62 this compares unfavorably with the 4.44 mev @xmath39-ray flux eq .",

    "the more energetic dt neutrons and the gamma rays they produce will also excite the scintillator , so it produces a weighted sum signal .",

    "the calculation includes all relevant neutron , electron and photon processes .",
    "we define a figure of merit of the detector system : @xmath73 the first factor is the ratio of energy deposited by 2.45 mev neutrons into the unfiltered detector to that deposited into the detector with graphite converter and filter , and the second factor is the ratio of energy deposited by 14.1 mev neutrons into the detector with converter and filter to that deposited into the unfiltered detector .",
    "ideally , these ratios would be infinite , so that the unfiltered detector would only detect 2.45 mev neutrons and the detector with converter and filter would only detect 14.1 mev neutrons .",
