    "the detection of galaxies at the highest redshifts ( @xmath29 ) continues to be a difficult endeavor . due to the redshifting of uv light into the infrared ( ir ) and the well - known limitations of current ir instruments , searches for these objects require almost prohibitive amounts of telescope time .",
    "nevertheless , small amounts of deep ir data do exist , and they can be used to set constraints on very high redshift galaxies .",
    "one notable example is the @xmath30-dropout sample compiled by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2004c ) which , although limited by small numbers ( @xmath31 objects ) and field - to - field variations , provided a first detection of galaxies at redshifts beyond @xmath32 . in this paper",
    ", we look at the prevalence of galaxies at @xmath17 by applying the dropout technique to the wide variety of deep f110w and f160w - band fields that have been imaged with nicmos ( hereinafter , refered to as @xmath0 and @xmath5 , respectively )",
    ". our principal data set in this study will be the two deep nicmos parallels taken with the udf ( each has @xmath33 orbits of data ) , but we will complement this field with a variety of shallower fields possessing similar @xmath0 + @xmath5 imaging .",
    "these fields include the hdf - north thompson field ( thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) , the hdf - north dickinson field ( dickinson et al .",
    "1999 ) , the deep hdf - south parallel nicmos field ( williams et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the nicmos footprint on the udf itself ( thompson et al .  2005 ) .",
    "galaxies in the redshift range @xmath17 are currently of great interest due to indications that reionization of the universe may have started as soon as @xmath34 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) and that galaxies may have played a major role in this process ( e.g. , yan & windhorst 2004 ; stiavelli et al .",
    "we take @xmath35 to denote the characteristic luminosity of galaxies at @xmath36 ( steidel et al .",
    "ab magnitudes are used throughout .",
    "we assume @xmath37 ( bennett al .  2003 ) .",
    "_ ( a ) nicmos parallels to the udf . _",
    "the two nicmos parallels to the udf ( taken during the first and second epochs of acs observations ) make up our primary data set .",
    "each parallel consisted of @xmath38200 orbits of data , split between two pointings which overlap by @xmath3825% of a nic3 pointing ( @xmath39s were taken at the first and @xmath40s at the second ) .",
    "the observing time at each position was split nearly equally between @xmath0 and @xmath5-band observations . while reductions of these fields are available through stsci ( http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/udf/udf_hlsp.html ) , we used the nicmos procedures described in thompson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to perform our own reduction .",
    "the deeper of the two pointings making up each parallel had approximate @xmath4 depths of 28.6 and 28.5 ( 0.6@xmath6aperture ) in the @xmath0 and @xmath5-bands , respectively .",
    "the shallower pointings were some @xmath380.6 mags less deep .",
    "our reductions were drizzled onto a 0.09-pixel scale , with approximate psfs of 0.32@xmath6 and 0.34@xmath6 fwhm in the @xmath0 and @xmath5-bands , respectively . for optical coverage on these fields , the @xmath41 and @xmath30-band images from galaxy evolution morphology survey ( rix et al .",
    "2004 : images # 25 , # 42 , and # 49 ) were used ( blakeslee et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "_ ( b ) shallower nicmos fields .",
    "_ to add area at brighter magnitudes , we included a number of other fields with deep @xmath3 imaging in our @xmath0-dropout search .",
    "a list of these fields is provided in table 1 , together with their approximate @xmath4 limiting magnitudes ( @xmath42 aperture ) and selection areas .",
    "other multi - wavelength data for these fields include deep @xmath43 coverage for the hdf - n ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , ultra deep acs @xmath44 coverage for the udf ( beckwith et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , nicmos @xmath45 coverage of the hdf - s nicmos parallel ( williams et al.2000 ) , and deep irac data in the 3.6@xmath46 m and 4.5@xmath46 m channels for the goods north and south ( dickinson et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was used to do object detection and photometry .",
    "detection was performed using an aggressive @xmath47 detection threshold on the @xmath5-band images .",
    "our catalogs were then cleaned of contamination from more extended background artifacts by requiring objects to be @xmath4 detections in a 0.5-aperture .",
    "we used scaled aperture magnitudes ( kron 1980 : sextractor mag_auto ) for our @xmath5-band total magnitudes .",
    "colors were also measured with scaled apertures , but with a much smaller kron factor to maximize the s / n . for images with different psfs , colors were only measured after the higher resolution image had been degraded to match the broader psf and only in a circular aperture which was at least @xmath48 the fwhm of the broader psf ( see bouwens et al .",
    "2003 and b05 for more details ) .    _",
    "( a ) @xmath0-dropout selection .",
    "_ our principal selection criterion for our sample was a @xmath49 color cut , where the @xmath0-band flux was replaced by its @xmath28 upper limit in cases of a @xmath0-band non - detection .",
    "this criterion was chosen to minimize contamination from all objects except @xmath50 evolved galaxies ( figure 1 ) .",
    "in addition , objects were required to be non - detections ( @xmath51 ) in all optical bands as a result of absorption from the intergalactic medium and to be blue ( @xmath52 mag ) in all @xmath53 or @xmath54 colors , since only a small fraction ( @xmath55% ) of star - forming galaxies have sufficiently red uv continuum slopes @xmath56",
    "( i.e. , @xmath57 ) to produce these colors ( adelberger & steidel 2000 ; schiminovich et al",
    ".  2004 ) .",
    "applying our @xmath8 color cut to object catalogs from both our primary and shallow search fields , 11 objects were found ( table 2 ) . of the 11 , 6 were readily detected ( @xmath9 ) in the bluer optical bands .",
    "two had very red @xmath53 colors ( @xmath58 ) and so also appear to be low - redshift interlopers .",
    "this was a little uncertain for one of the two ( hdfspar-48278437 ) due to the marginal nature of its @xmath45-band detection , but irac imaging should clarify this issue .",
    "the final three sources ( shown in figure 2 with two red objects from our selection ) could not be excluded by either criterion , though this may be largely due to the fact they were in the udf - parallel fields .",
    "the optical imaging in these fields are not particularly deep , nor is there any deep spitzer or k - band data to measure colors longward of the break .",
    "_ ( b ) low - redshift contamination .",
    "_ to help determine whether the 3 potential @xmath2 candidates were low - redshift interlopers or not , we made simple estimates of the contamination from different types of sources .",
    "the only known stellar sources red enough to match these objects are extreme carbon stars or mira variables ( whitelock et al .",
    "1995 ) but contamination from such sources seem unlikely due to both their rarety and high intrinsic luminosities , which would put them well outside the galaxy ( dickinson et al .  2000 ) .",
    "contamination from redder , evolved galaxies is difficult to estimate given the large uncertainties on the shape of the lf of these galaxies at @xmath59 . here , we ignore these complications and simply scatter the colors of a brighter set of galaxies ( @xmath60 ) from our fields to fainter magnitudes . performing these experiments on the faint source population from the deep parallels",
    ", we estimate @xmath61 such contaminants .",
    "this seems consistent albeit a little less than the @xmath62 sources obtained .",
    "a stack of the @xmath41 and @xmath0 exposures for all 3 sources showed detections of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , again suggesting some contamination .    _",
    "( c ) expected numbers / incompleteness . _",
    "having found at most 3 possible @xmath2 sources over our entire 14.7 arcmin@xmath65 search area , it is interesting to ask how many we might have expected assuming no - evolution from lower redshift .",
    "two different redshift samples are considered as baselines : ( 1 ) a @xmath13 @xmath14-dropout sample from goods ( b05 ) and ( 2 ) a @xmath15 @xmath16-dropout sample from the hudf ( bouwens et al .",
    "2005b ) . as in other recent work ( bouwens et al .",
    "2004a , b , c ) , we project this sample to higher redshift ( over the range @xmath66 : see figure 3 ) using our well - established cloning machinery ( bouwens et al .",
    "1998a , b ; bouwens et al .  2003 ; b05 ) , accounting for pixel morphologies , the angular - size distance relationship , nicmos psfs , k - corrections , and object - by - object volume densities .",
    "transformed objects are added to the present nicmos data and the selection procedure repeated .",
    "direct use of the data appears to be the best way of accounting for the substantial variations in s / n which occur across nicmos mosaics while including possible blending with foreground galaxies .",
    "simulations were run over @xmath3830@xmath67 the area of the fields . assuming no - evolution in size",
    ", 5.7 and 4.1 objects are expected in total ( over the 6 fields ) for our @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16-dropout samples , respectively . if we account for the increase in surface brightness expected due to the @xmath68 size scaling observed at @xmath69 ( bouwens et al.2004a , b ; ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ) , the expectations increase to 15.6 and 4.8 , respectively .",
    "steeper size scalings ( e.g. , @xmath70 ) yield 21.2 and 6.3 @xmath0-dropouts , respectively , while use of a bluer uv continuum slope @xmath56 ( e.g. , @xmath71 ) resulted in 16.2 and 4.0 , respectively ( assuming a @xmath18 size scaling ) .",
    "we note that the two nicmos parallels to the udf account for @xmath72% of the expected numbers ( and are therefore our primary constraints ) , though each of the 6 fields contributes at least a few percent .",
    "we take the @xmath18 scaling estimates , 15.6 from @xmath13 and 4.8 from @xmath15 as the most likely expected values .    _",
    "( d ) previous work .",
    "_ one previous study of @xmath73 candidates was carried out by yahata et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on the 0.8 arcmin@xmath74 nic3 parallel to the hdf south featured here . in that paper ,",
    "8 @xmath75 candidates were reported ( 5 of which were selected in the @xmath5-band ) based upon 9-band ( ubvrijhk+stis ) photometric redshifts .",
    "what became of these 5 candidates here ? looking through our catalogs for this field , we found that one ( sb - ni-0915 - 0620 ) had @xmath76 colors ( @xmath77 ) that were clearly inconsistent with a high redshift identification .",
    "the other 4 appeared to be too faint ( @xmath78 ) to set strong lower limits on the @xmath79 colors and thus make robust statements about their redshifts .",
    "we have carried out a search for @xmath2 @xmath80-dropouts and found at most 3 possible candidates . since @xmath81 and @xmath82 candidates are expected ( poisson errors ) based on a @xmath18 scaling of @xmath13 and @xmath15 samples , this suggests there has been appreciable evolution at the bright end of the luminosity function . since an @xmath83 galaxy at @xmath24 has a @xmath84-band magnitude of 26.7 , our search ( @xmath1 ) tells us something about the galaxy luminosities brightward of @xmath25 . for simple poissonian statistics and assuming that all 3 sources are at @xmath2 , the current findings are inconsistent with no - evolution at the 99.98% and 71% confidence levels , respectively ( equivalent to @xmath85 and @xmath28 ) .    of course",
    ", cosmic variance is bound to be important for fields of this size . assuming a selection window of width @xmath86 , a @xmath87cdm power spectrum , and a bias of @xmath88which corresponds to the rough volume density of sources @xmath89 mpc@xmath90 explored by this probe ( mo & white 1996)we calculate @xmath3827% rms variations field - to - field for single 0.8 arcmin@xmath74 nic3 pointings ( using a pencil beam window function ) . since our deepest two fields provide the primary constraints and they are essentially independent , the total number of @xmath80-dropouts found here is expected vary by @xmath3819% rms relative to the cosmic average .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath38@xmath91 and @xmath38@xmath92 dropouts , respectively , for simple projections of our lower redshift samples , and so the present findings are inconsistent with no - evolution at the 99.9% and 68% confidence levels , respectively ( equivalent to @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "it is conventional to cast these findings in terms of the rest - frame continuum @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) luminosity density .",
    "we first estimate the luminosity density under the assumption that the 3 candidates ( figure 2 ) are at @xmath2 .",
    "the result is @xmath95 ( 3 over 15.6 for poissonian statistics ) or @xmath96 ( including cosmic variance ) . taking the value of the luminosity density at @xmath13 ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) integrated down to @xmath25 , we find a uv luminosity density @xmath97 erg s@xmath98 hz@xmath98 ( poissonian statistics ) or @xmath99 erg s@xmath98 hz@xmath98 ( including cosmic variance ) .",
    "however , it is quite plausible that none of these candidates are at @xmath2 . the expected high contamination level combined with the",
    "now well established changes in the lf between @xmath100 and @xmath101 suggests that it is more likely that these sources are low redshift objects . assuming that none are at @xmath2 , the @xmath28 upper limit is : @xmath102 ( both for simple poissonian statistics and including cosmic variance ) . in terms of the luminosity density , this limit is @xmath103 erg s@xmath98 hz@xmath98 . adopting a salpeter imf and using canonical relations to convert this into a star formation rate density ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ) , we can plot the present determination ( integrated down to @xmath25 ) against previous determinations at lower redshift ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the observations now more clearly than before allow us to trace the number of @xmath22-bright systems over the interval @xmath104 .",
    "the space density of high luminosity systems seems to peak at @xmath105 and decline fairly rapidly to both higher and lower redshift .    as we conclude , it is somewhat sobering to realize that @xmath38740 orbits of deep nicmos imaging went into this search and only 3 possible @xmath2 candidates were found ( all of which may be at low redshift ) , showing how difficult it is to map out the formation of galaxies at these early times with current technology . it is exciting nevertheless to realize that in the future these surveys will be executed much more efficiently .",
    "for example , surpassing the current nicmos data set would require just @xmath3823 orbits with hst wfc3 and @xmath106 seconds with jwst .",
