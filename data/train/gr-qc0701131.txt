    "this damping mechanism results again in the formation of an equilibrium configuration after the collision .",
    "the rigorous mathematical description of the dynamical transition phase is difficult and requires extensive numerical investigations .",
    "however , interesting information about the collision can be obtained by comparing the initial and final ( equilibrium ) states .",
    "this thermodynamic idea avoids the analysis of the transition process and reduces the mathematical effort to solving the einstein equations for the end products , which are stationary and axisymmetric in our case .",
    "the solution makes use of conservation laws which transfer data extracted from the initial configurations ( spheres and disks before the collision ) to the final configurations .",
    "while the _ initial _ configurations are available the calculation of the _ final _ states is rather difficult . to cope with this problem for head - on colliding stars and disks , we will make use of two heuristic principles :    * perfect fluid configurations at rest are spherically symmetric . hence , the end product of two head - on colliding spheres without angular momentum is again a sphere ( a fluid ball or a schwarzschild black hole ) . *",
    "dust configurations are two - dimensional ( extremely flattened ) and axisymmetric ( with non - vanishing angular momentum ) .",
    "consequently , the dust matter after a head - on collision of two disks of dust is again two - dimensional and axisymmetric ( a compact disk , a disk surrounded by dust rings or a black hole surrounded by dust rings ) .",
    "though plausible , these principles have not been proved rigorously so far . for proofs under special assumptions",

    "an important point of the procedure would be the stability analysis of the end products .",
    "as for our investigation , there is important evidence from newtonian gravity that rigidly or differentially rotating disks of dust are unstable .",

    "in general , the total energy loss calculated via the comparison of initial and final equilibrium configurations is only an upper limit for the energy loss ( efficiency ) due to gravitational emission .",

    "we will present a disk collision model which is exclusively damped by gravitational radiation . the resulting differentially rotating disk will be compared with a rigidly rotating disk of the same baryonic mass and angular momentum formed from the same initial disks under the additional influence of dissipative processes in the matter ( see [ dr ] ) .",

    "this assumption can only be justified if friction processes between the disk rings provide for a constant angular velocity throughout the disk .",
    "this model seems to be somewhat artificial and unsuited to determining the contribution of gravitational radiation to the total energy loss .",
    "interestingly , our present investigation will show that the frictional contribution to the total energy loss for colliding rigidly rotating disks is comparably small .",

    "the application of this method to collisions of perfect fluid stars and collisions of rigidly rotating disks of dust leads to restrictions of the initial parameters .",
    "it turned out that the formation of final stars / disks from stars / disks is only possible for a subset of the parameter space of the initial objects .",
