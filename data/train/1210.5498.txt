    "the interplay between the magnetic field and the quark - gluon matter created in the collisions is characterized by two phenomena : the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) and the chiral separation effect ( cse ) .",
    "the cme is the phenomenon of electric charge separation along the axis of the magnetic field in the presence of a finite axial chemical potential ( e.g. chiral potential due to fluctuating topological charge )  @xcite .",
    "star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite collaborations at rhic have reported experimental observations of charge asymmetry fluctuations possibly providing an evidence for cme .",
    "this interpretation is still under intense discussion , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",

    "the cme and cse effects form a collective excitation , chiral magnetic wave ( cmw ) , a long wavelength hydrodynamic mode of chiral charge densities  @xcite .",
    "the cmw manifests itself in a finite electric quadrupole moment of the collision system , where the  poles \" (  equator \" ) of the produced fireball acquire additional positive ( negative ) charge  @xcite .",
