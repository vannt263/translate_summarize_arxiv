    "since 1964 , after the pioneering work of hohenberg and kohn @xcite , density functional theory ( dft ) became the standard tool for the calculation of groundstate ( gs ) properties of quantum - mechanical systems .",
    "there are , however , some physical problems which are difficult to address in the framework of dft .",
    "these include the description of strongly correlated systems , such as the dissociation of closed shell molecules into open shell fragments , and the fundamental gap in mott insulators .",
    "recently , a promising alternative to dft was introduced which showed success in various fields , ranging from small molecules @xcite to infinite solids @xcite , including the difficult cases mentioned above .",
    "this method features the one - reduced density matrix ( 1rdm ) as central variable and is called reduced density matrix functional theory ( rdmft ) . in the theoretical framework of rdmft , the functional form of the kinetic as well as of the exchange energy are known exactly in terms of the 1rdm and only the correlation part of the two - particle interaction energy has to be approximated .",
    "however , a minimization of functionals in rdmft is complicated by the fact that at zero temperature there is no noninteracting system reproducing the 1rdm of the interacting system .",
    "this is in contrast to dft where the kohn - sham system @xcite allows for an efficient self - consistent minimization .",
    "therefore , in rdmft one usually resorts to direct minimization routines .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that one can indeed construct a noninteracting system which reproduces a given 1rdm to arbitrary accuracy , if one considers this system to be in grand canoncial equilibrium at finite temperature .",
    "we therefore effectively model a zero - temperature interacting system by a finite - temperature noninteracting one .",
    "this allows one to construct a self - consistent kohn - sham minimization scheme for functionals in rdmft .",
    "capitalizing on the freedom of choice for the temperature of the kohn - sham system , we will furthermore introduce the concept of a temperature tensor .",
    "this concept will later on be shown to greatly improve the performance of our minimization procedure .",
    "we will then argue , why the energy value in a numerical minimization of a rdmft functional is not a good measure of convergence .",
    "as alternatives we introduce two convergence measures which rely solely on the functional derivative of the rdmft functional w.r.t . the 1rdm .",
    "finally , we will investigate the performance of the new minimization scheme by applying a common rdmft functional to lih .",
    "it will be shown that the self - consistent scheme is very efficient and avoids conceptual difficulties prevalent in many other minimization procedures .",
    "in this work , we will consider systems governed by a hamiltonian @xmath0 consisting of the kinetic energy @xmath1 , the external one - particle potential @xmath2 , and the two - particle interaction @xmath3 : @xmath4 a quantum - mechanical system is generally described by a statistical density operator ( sdo ) @xmath5 being a weighted sum of projection operators on the hilbert space under consideration @xmath6 the 1rdm @xmath7 , corresponding to a particular sdo @xmath5 , is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the common field operators and the variable @xmath10 denotes a combination of spacial coordinate @xmath11 and spin index @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "an integration over @xmath10 is therefore to be interpreted as an integration over @xmath11 and a summation over @xmath12 . by construction",
    ", @xmath7 is hermitean and can therefore be written in spectral representation @xmath14 the @xmath15 are traditionally called the natural orbitals ( no ) and the @xmath16 are the occupation numbers ( on ) @xcite .",
    "the conditions that ensure that a given @xmath7 is ensemble - n - representable , i.e. that it comes from a sdo of the form of eq.([eq.sdo.0 ] ) , are the following @xcite . @xmath17 the set of all ensemble - n - representable 1rdms is given by @xmath18 which is closed and convex .    following from the theorems of hohenberg and kohn @xcite , we know that one can formulate a functional theory of the 1rdm for the determination of the gs energy .",
    "it was gilbert @xcite who showed that this theoretical framework is also capable of describing systems subject to nonlocal external potentials , a task not possible via dft .",
    "we have furthermore shown in @xcite that this methodology can be extended to the case of quantum - mechanical systems in grand canonical equilibrium .",
    "the functional for the energy @xmath19 $ ] of the interacting and for the grand potential @xmath20 $ ] of a noninteracting system in grand canonical equilibrium are given as @xmath21&=t[\\gamma]+v_{ext}[\\gamma]+w[\\gamma]\\label{eq.e}\\\\    \\omega_0[\\gamma]&=t[\\gamma]+v_{ext}[\\gamma]-\\mu n[\\gamma]-1/\\beta s_0[\\gamma]\\label{eq.gp - ni}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22&=\\int dx'\\lim_{x\\rightarrow x'}\\left(-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2}\\right)\\gamma(x',x)\\\\    v_{ext}[\\gamma]&=\\int dxdx'v_{ext}(x , x')\\gamma(x',x)\\\\    n[\\gamma]&=\\int dx\\gamma(x , x)\\\\    s_0[\\gamma]&=-\\sum_i(n_i\\ln n_i+(1-n_i)\\ln(1-n_i))\\label{eq.ent.ni}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the functional @xmath23 $ ] for the interaction contribution is not known exactly and has to be approximated in practice .",
    "the noninteracting grand potential can be written solely in terms of the one - particle eigenenergies and the ons as @xmath24&=\\sum_i\\big(n_i({\\varepsilon}_i-\\mu)+{\\nonumber}\\\\    & \\hspace*{15mm}\\frac{1}{\\beta}(n_i\\ln n_i+(1-n_i)\\ln(1-n_i))\\big)\\label{eq.num.gp - ni - exp}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the context of this work , the question of noninteracting ( ni)-v - representability , i.e. the question which 1rdms correspond to a groundstate or equilibrium of a noninteracting system , will become important .",
    "the sets of all zero - temperature ni - v - representable and finite - temperature ni - v - representable 1rdms will be denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in the case of zero temperature",
    "a nondegenerate system assumes a pure groundstate and the corresponding noninteracting 1rdm will be idempotent .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 is on the boundary of @xmath27 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the gs-1rdm of a coulomb system is in the interior of @xmath27 and , therefore , we can not use a noninteracting system at zero temperature to find the minimum of an rdmft functional .",
    "in simple terms : the 1rdm of interacting particles is never idempotent and , hence , it can not be represented as the 1rdm of a kohn - sham - type noninteracting system at zero temperature . at finite temperature , however , for a noninteracting system with one - particle eigenvalues @xmath28 , the ons are given by the fermi - dirac distribution @xcite which can easily be inverted : @xmath29 this implies that all 1rdms in the interior of @xmath27 are in @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , for every 1rdm in @xmath27 there is a 1rdm from @xmath26 arbitrarily close to it which allows the utilization of a noninteracting system in grand canonical equilibrium in a self - consistent minimization scheme .",
    "we emphasize the term `` arbitrarily close '' because pinned ons ( i.e. 0 or 1 ) can not be reproduced by a system at finite temperature ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq.ei.ni ] ) ) , but every on arbitrarily close to 0 or 1 can .",
    "the error introduced by these pinned states therefore becomes arbitrarily small .",
    "the biggest stumbling stone in the numerical minimization of rdmft functionals is the incorporation of the auxiliary constraints on the ons and nos of the 1rdm .",
    "these are particle number conservation @xmath30 , the fermionic constraint @xmath31 , and most importantly , the orthonormality constraints of the nos .",
    "usually , the orthonormality of the nos will be enforced by applying an orthonomalization algorithm to the nos after they have been modified , using the information provided by the functional derivatives @xmath32/\\delta\\phi_i$ ] .",
    "these orthonormalization procedures can change several orbitals quite significantly which can lead to a slow convergence of the minimization routines .",
    "the main idea of a self - consistent minimization scheme is now to approximate the energy surface @xmath19 $ ] by a simpler one whose minimum , incorporating all auxiliary constraints , can be found easily . in our situation , we take the information about the derivatives of @xmath19 $ ] at @xmath33 and construct an effective noninteracting system in grand canonical equilibrium whose grand potential functional @xmath20 $ ] has the same functional derivative in @xmath33 .",
    "the minimum of this energy surface is found by a diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian and an occupation of the new ons according to the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the resulting eq-1rdm will then serve as the starting point for the subsequent iteration .",
    "this method automatically incorporates the constraints on the ons and nos and we will not have to apply subsequent orthonormalizations and the like .",
    "the success of this scheme , of course , relies on the similarity of the energy surfaces of @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we will now proceed to derive the variational equations , guiding the determination of @xmath33 .",
    "the effective noninteracting system is constructed such that the derivatives of the interacting as well as of the noninteracting functional ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq.e ] ) and ( [ eq.gp-ni ] ) ) coincide .",
    "@xmath34}{\\delta\\gamma(x , x')}&=\\frac{\\delta e[\\gamma]}{\\delta\\gamma(x , x')}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the possibility of pinned states , this equation does not have to be fulfilled exactly .",
    "therefore , as mentioned before , our minimization routine may not reach the exact minimum but will approach it arbitrarily closely . the effective hamiltonian in spatial representation then becomes @xmath35(x , x')=t[\\gamma](x , x')+v_{ext}(x , x')+\\\\    \\mu\\delta(x - x')+1/\\beta\\sigma[\\gamma](x , x')+v_{w}[\\gamma](x , x')\\label{eq.num.veff}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the functional derivatives are given by @xmath36(x , x')&=\\frac{\\delta w[\\gamma]}{\\delta\\gamma(x , x')}\\\\    \\sigma[\\gamma](x , x')&=\\frac{\\delta s_0[\\gamma]}{\\delta \\gamma(x , x')},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we want to use the chain rule for the functional derivative .",
    "we therefore need the derivatives of the ons and nos with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "they can be obtained using first - order perturbation theory , yielding @xmath37 in the following , it will be useful to work in the basis of nos .",
    "an arbitrary function @xmath38 is then represented by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 the matrix elements @xmath41 of the effective hamiltonian then become @xmath42}{\\partial n_i}+\\mu+\\frac{\\sigma_i}{\\beta}\\right)+\\\\    \\frac{1-\\delta_{ij}}{n_i - n_j}\\int dy\\left(\\frac{\\delta e[\\gamma]}{\\delta\\phi_i(y)}\\phi_j(y)-\\frac{\\delta e[\\gamma]}{\\delta\\phi^*_j(y)}\\phi^*_i(y)\\right)\\label{eq.num.heff.ij},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the entropic contribution @xmath43 is given by @xmath44}{\\partial n_i}=\\ln{\\left(\\frac{1-n_i}{n_i}\\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the offdiagonal elements are exactly the ones pernal @xcite derived in her approach for the derivation of an effective potential for rdmft .",
    "they are also simply related to the ones piris and ugalde @xcite introduced in their method for an orbital minimization .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that in our approach the diagonal elements are not free to choose but are determined by the thermodynamic ensemble .",
    "the temperature of the kohn - sham system has no physical meaning and can be varied to influence the convergence behaviour of the minimization routine . if @xmath45 was small , i.e. if the corresponding effective temperature was high , the diagonal part of @xmath46 will be bigger compared to the offdiagonal parts . therefore , after a diagonalization of @xmath46 , the orbitals will change less . when considering the change in ons",
    ", one can investigate the limit of @xmath47 .",
    "the diagonal of @xmath46 will then just contain the entropic contribution @xmath43 .",
    "a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq.num.heff.ij ] ) will then leave the ons invariant .",
    "we will further investigate the behaviour of our self - consistent minimization scheme for small @xmath45 later on in this work .    in the following",
    ", we will show how the concept of a temperature tensor greatly enhances the adaptability of the kohn - sham system which will improve the performance of the minimization procedure .      to understand how the concept of a temperature tensor improves the performance of the minimization scheme",
    ", the following considerations will be helpful . in a self - consistent minimization scheme , for a given 1rdm",

    "one would like to have some sort of state - dependent @xmath56 which can be related to the second derivatives .",

    "as can be seen from figure [ fig.num.model.2 ] , with a good choice of @xmath64 ( in our model @xmath67 ) one can reproduce the different energy surfaces simultaneously .",

    "we need , however , some measures to judge if a calculation is converged .",
    "there are two main reasons why using the energy itself as convergence measure is disadvantageous .",
    "firstly , often the calculation of derivatives is not accurate and consequently a derivative - based minimization may lead to a fixpoint where @xmath19 $ ] is not minimal .",
    "this leads to a sign change of the convergence measure and implementing the strict decrease of energy as a requirement of the minimization procedure will then lead to a starting point dependent result . secondly , because the true minimal energy is not known , one would have to judge convergence from the change in @xmath19 $ ] after iterating the minimization routine , i.e. a small change in @xmath19 $ ] indicates a relative closeness to the real minimum .",
    "this might pose a problem if the minimum of the energy - surface , as defined by the derivatives of @xmath19 $ ] , is very shallow or , worse , if the minimization procedure leads to a slow approach to the minimum .",
    "an example for such a situation is discussed in the summary .",
    "because of these problems , we would rather use a strictly positive convergence measure which goes to 0 if the 1rdm approaches the minimum of the energy - surface , as defined by the derivatives of @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "we will establish our choice of convergence measures on the following two observations .",
    "* in the minimum , the derivatives with respect to the ons will be equal for unpinned states .",
    "* in the minimum , the effective hamiltonian @xmath46 will be diagonal .",
    "the first observation allows us to define a convergence measure @xmath93 for a minimization with respect to the ons : @xmath94 the second statement leads to the following definition of @xmath95 as a convergence measure for a minimization with respect to the nos : @xmath96 if a minimization is converging , both measures should approach 0 .",
    "we test the self - consistent procedure for the case of solid lih at zero temperature by using the fp - lapw code elk @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy will be modelled by the @xmath97 functional @xmath98 $ ] , as introduced in @xcite .",

    "it will lead to several fully occupied , i.e. pinned states .",
    "therefore , as argued before , there is no noninteracting system at finite temperature reproducing this 1rdm exactly but there will be one leading to an equilibrium 1rdm arbitrarily close .",

    "furthermore , the @xmath97 functional exhibits divergencies in the derivatives w.r.t . the ons for @xmath102 . if , in the minimum , there are ons close to 0 ( and there will be if one considers enough nos ) this might lead to convergence problems of the minimization .    we will now investigate the performance of the self - consistent minimization scheme w.r.t .",
    "on- and no - convergence .",
    "it turned out in the course of our investigations that a mixing of 1rdms , according to point 6 in figure [ fig.num.sc ] , does not improve our results and we therefore abstain from it .",
    "we have minimized the @xmath97 functional for @xmath103 with three methods .",
    "first , we have used the steepest - descent method , as implemented in elk .",
    "the second method is the self - consistent ft - rdmft minimization with constant @xmath45 , and finally we have employed a temperature tensor @xmath56 of the form of eq .",

    "a dramatic improvement in the speed of convergence is achieved by employing a temperature tensor .",
    "the slow decrease of @xmath93 in figures [ fig.num.rdmks.on.k2.chi2 ] and [ fig.num.rdmks.on.k3.chi2 ] for the steepest - descent and constant-@xmath45 methods can be attributed to the following fact .",
    "for these two methods , the ons , which will be pinned at the equilibrium , approach their final values quite slowly . therefore , their derivatives contribute to @xmath93 via eq .",
    "( [ eq.num.chi2n ] ) even after several iterations .",
    "we can now turn to the problem of minimizing @xmath19 $ ] with respect to both ons and nos .",
    "we find that the overall performance of this full minimization is greatly improved by introducing a on - minimization after every no - minimization step ( see figure [ fig.num.sc ] ) .",
    "because we have seen in the previous section that this can be done very efficiently , this increases the runtime of a full minimization run only negligibly .",
    "the deeper reason for the improvement of the convergence by inclusion of an on - minimization is the following : it typically happens that two states @xmath104 and @xmath105 have similar eigenvalues in @xmath46 but considerably different ons .",
    "a diagonalization of @xmath46 then yields a strong mixing between these states .",
    "if the ons were not updated , one might be led away from the minimum of the grand potential functional . a subsequent on - minimization remedies this problem and assigns the optimal on for each no .",
    "we show a sketch of the full minimization scheme in figure [ fig.num.full ] .",
    "an application of this scheme to lih then leads to the results depicted in figure [ fig.num.rdmks.full ] .",
    "again , we see a tremendous increase in speed and accuracy for the self - consistent kohn - sham minimization scheme compared to the steepest - descent method . the steepest - descent method shows a very slow convergence , which can be attributed to the orthonormalization of nos .",
    "the increase of the energy curves in figures [ fig.num.rdmks.full.k2.e ] and [ fig.num.rdmks.full.k3.e ] is due to the approximative nature of the derivatives .",

    "we could show that this self - consistent procedure is superior in many respects compared to the steepest - descent method , especially considering a minimization w.r.t .",

    "we show the behaviour of the minimization scheme for three different choices of @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath106 represents the optimal value , i.e. the value for which the convergence measure @xmath107 decreases the fastest .",
    "we see that the energy reaches its fixpoint after approximately 300 iterations .",
    "an increase of @xmath45 to @xmath108 seemingly speeds up the energy convergence , but from @xmath107 one can see that after about 100 iterations the minimization fails to diagonalize @xmath109 any further .",
    "the changes in the 1rdm , whose amplitudes are determined by @xmath45 , become too big and the 1rdm jumps around the fixpoint of the energy . without considering @xmath107 ,",
    "this would have been difficult to detect which illustrates the importance of a convergence measure which is independent of the energy value .",
    "one might argue that this choice of @xmath45 still leads to a fixpoint very close to the optimal one , but this can not be ensured for all problems and all choices of @xmath45 and therefore has to be seen in the actual example as rather accidental , i.e. fortunate",
    ". a further increase of @xmath45 to @xmath110 then exposes this problem more dramatically .",
    "the energy apparently reaches a fixpoint . but",
    "this fixpoint is considerably above the optimal one . just having the energy at hand ,",
    "this would have been difficult to detect .",
    "but @xmath107 directly shows that the minimization is far from being converged",
    ".    one important feature , which can be extracted from figures [ fig.num.rdmks.three.e ] and [ fig.num.rdmks.three.chi ] , is that all three parameters lead to a similar energy vs. iteration curve .",
    "apparently , a minimization - run with @xmath45 being too big is able to lead to the vicinity of the fixpoint .",
    "an utilization of this fact would now be to use an adaptive @xmath45 rather than a constant one .",
    "one could start with a big @xmath45 till the energy does not change anymore and than decrease @xmath45 until @xmath107 surpasses the convergence threshold .",
    "we expect that our successful demonstration of an efficient minimization scheme in rdmft will support the investigation and development of functionals and therefore encourage further work in this field of research",
