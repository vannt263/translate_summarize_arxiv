    "according to recent astrophysical data our universe goes through ( or will go through , sooner or later ) a de sitter phase . moreover , according to the inflationary paradigm , the universe in the past was also a de sitter space . taking into consideration the fact that the early universe was thermal ,",
    "one of the most promising candidates for modelling the early universe is the @xmath0 space .",
    "one of the fundamental issues about the early universe is the entropy issue , particularly , the occurence of the so called entropy bounds . one of the better known of these bounds involves the ratio of the entropy @xmath1 to the total energy @xmath2 of a closed physical system at high temperature , the bekenstein bound @xcite . for @xmath0 space",
    "the bekenstein bound reads @xcite@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the radius associated with @xmath5 .",
    "recently , however , a more restringent form of the above bound was proposed by verlinde @xcite ( for further developments of the verlinde formalism in four - dimensional de sitter space see ) .",
    "the verlinde bound , which applies only to conformal field theories ( cfts ) and admits an holographic interpretation , is given by@xmath6 the explicit verification of the verlinde bound was performed for a number of cfts , mainly in @xmath0 space , via the calculation of the corresponding partition function .",
    "the corresponding quantum bounds are weaker than the verlinde cft bound .",
    "as it should be expected , entropy bounds occur only for high temperature ; in the low temperature regime the corresponding entropy / energy ratio can be very large , in fact , it is limitless @xcite . for the early universe",
    ", however , only the high temperature regime matters .",
    "this being so , the fundamental question is : what is the most realistic entropy bound for the early universe ?",
    "so far , calculations of quantum versions of entropy bounds have been limited to cft .",
    "for example , the cases of a conformally invariant massless scalar field in spacetime of dimension @xmath7 , and of other types of massless fields in @xmath0 space , were considered in @xcite where the casimir energies @xcite at zero and finite temperature were exactly calculated .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to address this question , in the framework of non - conformal field theory , by considering a simple example : the case of a massive scalar field with an arbitrary scalar - gravitational coupling in @xmath0 space .",
    "it seems clear that this is a necessary step in the way towards the calculation of entropy bounds for more realistic quantum gravity theories ( for a general introduction see @xcite ) in the early de sitter universe , where gravitons are massive .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we briefly sketch a general zeta function formalism suitable for @xmath8 geometries , which is fundamented in previous work . in sect .",
    "3 , we apply this formalism to the special case of the @xmath0 geometry and obtain the low and high temperature representations for the basic set of thermodynamical functions . in sect .",
    "4 , the implication of the results for what concerns the entropy bounds is discussed .",
    "the last section contains a concluding summary .    throughout the paper , purely thermal quantities",
    "are denoted with a tilde , thus @xmath9 stands for the thermal energy , while untilded quantities include zero point contributions .",
    "we also employ natural units , @xmath10 , and set the boltzmann constant equal to one .",
    "we begin by reviewing the generalised zeta function approach @xcite for the construction of the logarithm of the partition function of the problem at hand . the eigenvalue equation in @xmath8 reads@xmath11 with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the euclidean time coordinate and @xmath14 the laplace operator on @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the conformal parameter , whose value is a function of the spacetime dimensions @xmath17 : @xmath18 $ ] ; @xmath19 is the ricci curvature scalar . equation ( [ main eigenvalue eq ] ) splits into two eigenvalue equations .",
    "the first is @xmath20 where @xmath21 satisfies periodic boundary conditions on @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , the reciprocal of the temperature @xmath25 , is the periodicity length for the compactified euclidean time axis .",
    "oscillating solutions of eq .",
    "( [ tau eigenvalue eq ] ) are given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an integer .",

    "( [ main eigenvalue eq ] ) , for the laplacian on @xmath31 is @xmath32 the eigenfunctions @xmath33 can be chosen as the spherical harmonics @xmath34 on @xmath31 , which satisfy @xmath35 and it follows that@xmath36 the complete spectrum of eigenvalues defined by the eigenvalue problem in @xmath37 , expressed by eq .",

    ", i.e. , we introduce the mellin transform and make use of the poisson sum formula ( or the jacobi theta function identity ) to formally split the partition function into two separate contributions , one corresponding to the zero - temperature casimir energy and one corresponding to its finite temperature correction .",
    "the final result is    @xmath47    equation ( [ partition function ii ] ) holds generally for @xmath8 geometries and contains all the relevant physical information we need at zero and finite temperature .",
    "the case of spatial dimension @xmath48 , however , needs to be handled with special care : the formalism must be slightly modified in order to take into account the presence of a zero mode .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the thermodynamics of the zero mode are internally inconsistent with the choice of a particular value for the scaling mass , they thus turn out to be unpredictive and , therefore , must be discarded from the formalism ( see ref . for more details and ref .",
    "@xcite for an independent statistical mechanical discussion ) .",
    "the simplicity , together with the suggestive physical meaning of eq . ( [ partition function ii ] ) , which provides a neat formal separation of the logarithm of the partition function into non - thermal and thermal sectors , is a direct , remarkable consequence of the generalised zeta - function technique employed here .",
    "we now apply the formalism described above to our specific problem , i.e. : the evaluation of the casimir zero point energy and the thermodynamics of a massive scalar field @xmath49 in a @xmath0 geometry , with an explicit conformal symmetry breaking due to mass , and deviations from the conformal value @xmath50 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the laplace operator on @xmath5 are given by @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , and degeneracy @xmath53 .",
    "hence , we can write @xmath54 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath55 is defined by @xmath56 this parameter plays a role similar to an effective mass .",
    "remark , however , that @xmath55 and @xmath57 are real numbers and that @xmath58 .",

    "( [ partition function ii ] ) , and obtain the relevant thermodynamical functions . for convenience , we discuss the low and the high temperature regimes separately , and for the latter case , we distinguish between the open intervals @xmath64 and @xmath65 . after a convenient shift of the summation index , eq .",
