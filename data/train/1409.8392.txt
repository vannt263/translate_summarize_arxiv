    "the advent of single molecule manipulation techniques has opened up a new vista in the field of biophysics . using these techniques ,",
    "it is now possible to exert mechanical force , in the pico - newton range , on an individual molecule giving important information about molecular interactions  @xcite .",
    "if a mechanical force is exerted on the strands of double stranded dna ( dsdna ) , it unzips when the force exceeds a critical value  @xcite . below this critical value ,",
    "the dna is in the zipped phase , while above it , the dna is in the unzipped phase .",
    "unzipping of a dsdna has biological relevance .",
    "it is an initial step in processes such as dna replication and rna transcription , where the external force is exerted by enzymes  @xcite .",
    "the unzipping transition has been studied , both theoretically and experimentally , over 15 years and many important results have been established ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in recent years , the focus has been shifted to study the hysteresis in unbinding and rebinding of biomolecules  @xcite because it can provide useful information on the kinetics of conformational transformations , the potential energy landscape , and it can be used in controlling the folding pathway of a single molecule @xcite .",
    "more recently , the behavior of dna under a periodic force has been explored by using langevin dynamics simulation of an off - lattice coarse grained model for a short dna of @xmath10 base pairs @xcite .",
    "it was found that there exists a dynamical phase transition in which the dna can be taken from the zipped state to an unzipped state via a new dynamic state .",
    "it was shown that at low frequencies , the area of the hysteresis loop , @xmath11 , which represents the energy dissipated in the system scales with @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is the amplitude , and @xmath0 is the frequency of the oscillating force .",
    "the scaling exponents @xmath12 , were found @xcite to be the same as that of the isotropic spin system @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was claimed that the above exponents remain the same as the length of the dna changes from @xmath10 to @xmath13 base pairs @xcite .",
    "the studies of kumar et al . were restricted to small chain lengths because their simulations were computationally expensive due to the excluded volume interactions which limits the smallest time scale . however , using monte carlo simulations we could simulate the dna of lengths up to @xmath14 to study its behavior under the influence of a periodic force . for this purpose",
    ", we used a ( @xmath15 ) dimensional model of dsdna .",
    "this model can be solved exactly in the static force limit , and it has been studied in great detail via the generating function , and the exact transfer matrix techniques  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the results obtained from this model agrees qualitatively with the experimental results , and other models used for studying dna unzipping ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . by using finite size scaling on the dna of lengths @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , we find that the area of the hysteresis loop scales as @xmath4 at high frequencies whereas it scales as @xmath5 with @xmath19 and @xmath7 in the low - frequency regime . these exponents are completely different from the values @xmath12 reported in ref .",

    "the walks starting from the origin are restricted to go towards the positive direction of the diagonal axis ( z - direction ) without crossing each other .",
    "the directional nature of the walks takes care of self - avoidance and the correct base pairing of dna , i.e. , the monomers that are complementary to each other are allowed to occupy the same lattice site . for each such overlap there is a gain of energy @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "one end of the dna is anchored at the origin and a time - dependent periodic force @xmath27 with angular frequency @xmath0 and amplitude @xmath1 acts along the transverse direction ( @xmath20 direction ) at the free end .",
    "the strands of the dna can not cross each other , therefore , in the negative cycle of the sine function the strands remain in the zipped state . by taking the absolute value of the sine function in eq .",

    "the strands of the dna undergo rouse dynamics that consists of local corner - flip or end - flip moves  @xcite that do not violate mutual avoidance ( the self - avoidance is taken care of by the directional nature of the walks ) .",
    "the elementary move consists of selecting a random monomer from a strand , which itself is chosen at random , and flipping it .",
    "if the move results in overlapping of two complementary monomers , thus forming a base - pair between the strands , it is always accepted as a move . the opposite move , i.e. the unbinding of monomers ,",

    "the system is relaxed by a unit time ( 1mcs ) . upon incrementing @xmath40",
    "further , the above cycle gets repeated again and again . before taking any measurement , the simulation is run for @xmath42 cycles so that the system can reach the stationary state .    at this point , it is worthwhile to compare our model with the model of kumar et al .  @xcite . in their model ,",
    "a chain of length @xmath43 , whose first @xmath44 monomers are complementary to the rest half , is anchored ( at origin ) from one end , and a periodic force is acting on the free end along @xmath45direction .",
    "the monomers of the chain are chosen in such a manner that the @xmath46th monomer from the anchored end can bind only wit theh @xmath47th monomer of the chain , thus mimicking the base pair of the dna .",
    "the system evolves in the presence of an external periodic force , and the distance of the end monomer from the origin , @xmath22 , is monitored as a function of time by using langevin dynamics simulation . if @xmath48 ( for @xmath49 ) the dna is taken to be in the zipped state , otherwise it is in the unzipped state .",
    "their model becomes similar to ours ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) if , instead of first , the bead at the center of the chain is anchored , and a periodic force is applied on the first and the last monomers in opposite directions . in both models , the forcing is such that the force , averaged over a cycle , applied on the dna is not equal to zero .",
    "therefore , we expect that for a given amplitude @xmath1 , both models will have similar steady states in the larger frequency limit .",
    "this is indeed the case . for lower values of @xmath1 ( e.g. ,",
    "@xmath50 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath51 in our case ) , the steady state is a zipped configuration , while for higher values of @xmath1 ( e.g. , @xmath51 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath52 in our case ) , the dna is in an unzipped state .",
    "there are , however , few differences between the two models , but that has more to do with the simulation technique .",
    "for example , in langevin dynamics simulations , friction needs to be introduced to equilibrate the system .",
    "in contrast , monte carlo dynamics is dissipative by definition and brings the system to equilibrium . even though the langevin dynamics simulations of kumar et al .",
    "are done in 3 dimensions , the motion of the end bead is along the direction of an externally applied force .",
    "the quantity of interest is the hysteresis traced out by the end monomer . for temperatures below the melting temperature of dna , the fluctuations of the end bead along the transverse directions are small and",
    "hence the area of the hysteresis loop in the transverse directions is negligible .",
    "we have checked this for a self avoiding polymer in three dimensions .",

    "the dna is in the zipped state , where it takes a zig - zag configuration .",

    "for @xmath203 , the mean squared contour length of the chain increases as the square root of time  @xcite and therefore @xmath195 . due to the geometry of the square lattice ,",
    "the change in length of the dna by flipping a monomer ( diagonal along @xmath204axis ) is exactly equal to the change in the separation of the end monomers ( diagonal along @xmath45axis ) .",

    "we gave a simple analysis that could estimate @xmath3 , the frequency at which the maximum loop area is observed , and the frequencies of other peaks that appear for higher force amplitudes .",
    "we also explored the behavior of the hysteresis loop area for a wide range of frequencies for both lower and higher values of force amplitudes @xmath1 using the finite - size scaling .",
    "we found that the loop area scales as @xmath4 in the high - frequency range , whereas it scales as @xmath220 with exponents @xmath229 and @xmath230 in the low - frequency regime .",

    "we believe that the different values of exponents @xmath8 and @xmath9 are due to the shorter chain lengths used in their studies . it would be interesting to study longer chain lengths using langevin dynamics simulations to confirm the above results .",
    "the other interesting direction would be to include the bending rigidity of dsdna that has been ignored in this paper and study its influence on the dynamic exponents as a function of chain lengths .",
    "in fact , for chains of the order of persistence length of the dna , the bending rigidity could play an important role and the dynamic exponents may be different than reported in this paper .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit , the bending rigidity would not be relevant and we believe that the exponents of the flexible chain will be recovered .",
