    "since almost half of a century the hubbard model@xcite is one of the fundamental models in the theoretical description of strongly correlated electron systems . despite its simplicity it has always been taken as one of the prototypes when modeling electrons in narrow bands . within this context it had wide applications in the theory of magnetism @xcite and metal - insulator transitions",
    "@xcite . the discovery of the high-@xmath0 superconducting cuprate materials @xcite , where the special properties are to a large extent due to strong correlations @xcite , gave a new impetus on the investigation of the hubbard model and its derivates as the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 , the extended hubbard and the @xmath1-@xmath4 models",
    ". to gain a better theoretical understanding of the high-@xmath0 materials , not only the superconducting phase of the proposed models is studied , but also their normal phase and such with further broken symmetries .",
    "the antiferromagnetic state is of particular interest , as it is believed that the pairing mechanism in the cuprates is mainly due to magnetic correlations in an itinerant electronic system .",
    "in addition , the high-@xmath0 compounds show a wide range of metal - insulator transitions ; in particular , a phase transition from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a superconductor is observed .",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase of the hubbard model has been subject of intensive study by both numerical and analytical methods .    despite the simplicity of the model",
    "there are no exact solutions known except for a few special cases @xcite and one must recur to approximate solutions .",
    "the _ dynamical mean field theory _",
    "( _ dmft _ ) @xcite and a variety of projection techniques @xcite are among the most popular approaches to the hubbard model and its derivates .",
    "the _ composite operator method _ ( _ com _ ) @xcite that we present here belongs to the above mentioned class of projection techniques .",
    "choosing as elements of the fundamental spinor a set of field operators built up from the electronic ones ( hence the name ) , the equation of motion for the green s function of this spinor are obtained .",
    "these equations have been solved by means of both a pole approach @xcite and a two - site resolvent method @xcite .",
    "the use of composite operators asks for a careful choice of the fock space where the green s function is realized .",
    "we have shown that the pauli principle plays a fundamental role in unambiguously fixing the representation by determining the parameters that appear in the scheme owing to the non - canonical algebra of the composite operators @xcite .",
    "let us note that by pauli principle we mean all relations among operators dictated by the algebra .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of the paramagnetic phase of the hubbard model within the two - pole approximation has led to a good agreement with both numerical studies and some experimental properties of the cuprates @xcite . in the case of the 1d hubbard model",
    "we have shown that the two - pole approximation reproduces almost exactly the bethe ansatz results for the ground state energy @xcite .    in the last years",
    "an intensive study by the _ spectral density approach _ ( _ sda _ ) @xcite of the magnetic phases of the hubbard model on different lattice types and by varying dimensionality has been done @xcite and the complete magnetic phase diagram of the hubbard model on a 3d fcc - lattice was derived @xcite .",
    "the _ sda _ corresponds to an expansion of the green s function in terms of the electronic spectral moments .",
    "it has been shown that this approach corresponds to the _ com _ when a specific choice of the basic spinor is made and the pole approximation is used @xcite . however , this correspondence is only relative to the functional dependence of the green s function and huge differences arise when the representation is not properly fixed @xcite .    to complement the analysis of the paramagnetic phase for the hubbard model in the two - pole approximation by the _ com",
    ", we here present a study of the antiferromagnetic phase within this framework . as the most simple case of antiferromagnetism , where in general the spin and the translational invariance are broken , we consider an antiferromagnetic state on a bipartite lattice characterized by its staggered magnetization .",
    "it turns out that in this phase the simple hubbard model does not provide enough internal parameters to fix the representation .",
    "we therefore investigate the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 model in the limit of @xmath5 in two and three dimensions and the extended hubbard model in two dimensions .    in the first part of the paper , we develop the analytical background needed for the calculations .",
    "we end up with a closed set of self - consistent equations for the antiferromagnetic thermal equilibrium state , which respects the pauli principle and the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the numerical evaluation of these self - consistent equations is presented in the second part of the paper .",
    "the complete phase diagrams considering the paramagnetic and the antiferromagnetic phase for both models and in different dimensionality are calculated , as well as the density of states and the quasi - particle dispersions .",
    "the main results of the paper can be considered : the presence of three kinds of transitions ( mott - hubbard , mott - heisenberg and heisenberg ) at half - filling in the plane @xmath6-@xmath3 ; the existence of two components in the antiferromagnetic gap ( one due to the antiferromagnetic correlations and another coming from the mott - hubbard mechanism ) ; a finite critical value of the coulomb interaction for the mott - hubbard and mott - heisenberg transitions ; the strong decay of the nel temperature with doping ; a metal - insulator transition away from half - filling inside the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the hamiltonian for the single - band hubbard model @xcite with chemical potential @xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 with @xmath9 and where the sum over the site indices @xmath10 runs over the whole chemical lattice @xmath11 , which we consider to be of simple cubic type with lattice constant @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath3 is the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian is given by the nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "in @xmath13 dimensions the hopping matrix takes the form @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .    in the framework of the _ com",
    "_ we take as basic fields the hubbard operators : @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , describing the basic excitations @xmath19 and @xmath20 on the lattice site @xmath21 , which are responsible for the leading contributions in the electronic density of states @xcite .",
    "let use define the following four - component composite field at lattice site",
    "@xmath21 : @xmath22 where the variable @xmath1 denotes the time translate of the operator under the heisenberg dynamics generated by @xmath23 .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion for this basic field @xmath24 may be split into a part that is linear in the basic field and the remaining non - linear part @xmath25 by projecting it on the basic field .",
    "then , the matrix @xmath26 is fixed by @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the thermal average on the grand - canonical ensemble .    to simplify the notational effort we introduce the so - called normalization matrix @xmath29 and the so - called @xmath30-matrix @xmath31 and get the shorthand for the energy matrix @xmath32 from eq .  .",
    "the pole approximation consists in neglecting the nonlinear part @xmath33 in the equation of motion .",
    "this is equivalent to the suppression of the incoherent part in the retarded green s function matrix @xmath34 which then satisfies the linearized equation of motion @xmath35 @xmath13 is the dimension of the system , @xmath12 the lattice spacing and @xmath36 the brillouin zone .",
    "the resulting set of algebraic equations for the fourier transform of the retarded green s function may then be solved .",
    "the knowledge of the retarded green function will allow us to calculate the correlation functions @xmath37 by means of the spectral theorem .",
    "as already mentioned , the above scheme of truncating the equation of motion by a projection technique is rather common in the treatment of systems with strong correlations .",
    "when we use as basic fields , as we do in this work , the operators coming from the hierarchy of the equations of motion @xcite , the _ com _ is similar to the _ sda _ @xcite .",
    "however , the _ com _ gives the possibility of choosing the basic fields according to the physics of the system under investigation .",
    "this freedom allows a better control on the dynamical information still present in the generalized mean - field approximation .",
    "let us emphasize that even in the pole approximation the electronic self energy is not trivial as in the standard mean field approach , but a pole expansion of the exact electronic self energy is used .",
    "another fundamental difference between the _ com _ and the approaches mentioned above consists in the treatment of the higher - order correlation functions occurring in the energy matrix  , which are not directly related to elements of the green s function . as",
    "shown in a recent publication@xcite , there is no freedom in choosing the equations to compute those parameters as they have to be used to fix the representation according to the following relation @xmath38 where the l.h.s",
    ".  comes from eq .   and the r.h.s",
    ". derives from the basic algebraic properties of the electronic field algebra  namely the _",
    "pauli principle_. any other choice of the self - consistent equations that fix those parameters will lead to a representation for the green s function where the main symmetries of the system are violated @xcite . in the case of the hubbard model , eq",
    ".   leads to the following self - consistent equations    [ eq:2.14 ] @xmath39    the use of these equations , in the paramagnetic phase , led to a good agreement of the _ com _ with the numerical results for the local , integrated and thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the paramagnetic solution  characterized by a complete translational and spin rotational symmetry  , where the number of parameters in the energy matrix emerging from higher - order correlation functions equals the number of constrains given by the pauli principle , an antiferromagnetic solution with two composite fields , which is characterized by a broken translational and spin rotational symmetry ( they are , however , not broken in a completely independent way ) , requires additional parameters to satisfy all constrains emerging from the algebraic properties of the basic field operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that for the extensions of the simple hubbard model by a next nearest neighbor hopping term , the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 model , or by a nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion , the so - called extended hubbard model , the number of those parameters equals the number of ` algebraic ' constrains in the case of an antiferromagnetic solution . according to this , in the following",
    "we will investigate the antiferromagnetic solution of the 2d and 3d @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 model in the limit of @xmath2 going to zero and of the 2d extended hubbard model .",
    "for the antiferromagnetic solution the two poles corresponding to the two composite fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 , will split up into four poles due to the broken translational and spin rotational symmetry .",
    "as stated in the above we will study the antiferromagnetic solution of the hubbard model by considering the @xmath5 limit of the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the latter reads as @xmath42 where the @xmath43 matrix describes the next - nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the @xmath2-hopping is an intra - sublattice hopping for each of the two sublattices @xmath44 and @xmath45 of a bipartite square lattice , whereas the @xmath1-hopping is an inter - sublattice hopping .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an antiferromagnetic solution of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) characterized by an opposite sign in the spin density on nearest neighboring lattice sites .",
    "thus , the antiferromagnetic ordering induces a magnetic lattice @xmath46 with lattice constant @xmath47 , overlaying the chemical bravais lattice @xmath48 with lattice constant @xmath12 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the magnetic lattice is obtained as a square lattice with basis by collecting together two neighboring sites of the chemical lattice .    during the calculation of the green s functions it will be convenient to switch between the two equivalent representations of the system constructed on the chemical and on the magnetic lattice .",
    "we denote vectors belonging to the chemical lattice by their bare symbols , whereas the corresponding vectors on the magnetic lattice are denoted by an additional ` @xmath49'-symbol .",
    "we impose the following global boundary conditions on the antiferromagnetic thermal equilibrium state :    [ ass:1 ] the antiferromagnetic thermal equilibrium state has to satisfy the following global boundary conditions :    1 .",
    "the particle and spin densities are globally conserved .",
    "2 .   the mean value of the local particle density per spin satisfies the relation @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the staggered magnetization , which has to be calculated self - consistently . the particle density @xmath51 is imposed as an external parameter .",
    "further we adopt the convention @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "all expectation values are invariant under the contemporary exchange of the spin direction and the sublattice index .",
    "4 .   the normalization matrix @xmath29 and the @xmath30 matrix from eqs .   and have to be real .",
    "we remark that the conditions 1 .",
    "are natural boundary conditions for an antiferromagnetic thermal equilibrium state characterized by a staggered magnetization , whereas the condition 4 .",
    "is a direct consequence of the fact that we are looking for a state without quasi - particle damping , as required by the approximation scheme described in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .    to reduce the computational effort in solving the integral self - consistent equations we use a _ spherical approximation _ for the @xmath2-hopping , characterized by an additional hopping to next - next - nearest neighbors with half the weight of the next - nearest neighbor hopping , in the calculations of the integrals in the momentum space .",
    "this permits a definition of the @xmath2-hopping matrix by @xmath55 only and therefore reduces the number of evaluations to @xmath56 ",
    "@xmath57 the number of steps in the integrals  independently from the dimensionality of the system , while it would have been @xmath58 for a @xmath13-dimensional system with the usual next - nearest neighbor @xmath2-hopping matrix . in @xmath59 the @xmath2-hopping matrix is given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 ^2 - 1)$ ] .",

    "the antiferromagnetic phases of the three systems , where compared to the corresponding paramagnetic phases , lead to a phase transition of the second order . in all cases",

    "the existence of two components in the antiferromagnetic gap ( one due to the antiferromagnetic correlations and another coming from the mott - hubbard mechanism ) ; 3 .",
    "a finite critical value of the coulomb interaction for the mott - hubbard and mott - heisenberg transitions ; 4 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase is stable only in a very narrow region around half filling , showing a strong reduction of the nel temperature with doping ; 5 .",
    "a metal - insulator transition , driven by the temperature , takes place within the antiferromagnetic phase ; at half filling and higher temperatures this transition coincides with the paramagnetic - antiferromagnetic one ; 6 .   away from half - filling a metal - insulator transition driven by the doping is observed .",
    "this transition has the following properties : at zero temperature it is discontinuous and connects an antiferromagnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic insulator ; at finite temperature it connects the antiferromagnetic metal to an antiferromagnetic state of semiconductor type .",

    "<S> we firstly reported , within a pole approximation , three kinds of transitions at half - filling : mott - hubbard , mott - heisenberg and heisenberg . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found a metal - insulator transition , driven by doping , within the antiferromagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> this latter is restricted to a very small region near half filling and has , in contrast to what has been found by similar approaches , a finite critical coulomb interaction as lower bound at half filling . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth noting that our antiferromagnetic gap has two independent components : one due to the antiferromagnetic correlations and another coming from the mott - hubbard mechanism </S>",
