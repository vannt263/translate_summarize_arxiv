    "we discuss graph theoretic concepts , emerging from a practical networking problem introduced by csaba , faudree , gyrfs , and lehel in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath0 on at least @xmath1 vertices is called @xmath2-path - pairable if , for any pair of disjoint sets of ( pairwise different ) vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 of @xmath0 , there exist @xmath2 edge - disjoint @xmath5 paths joining the vertices .",
    "the path - parability number @xmath6 of a graph @xmath0 is the largest positive integer @xmath2 , for which @xmath0 is @xmath2-path - pairable .",
    "a graph on exactly @xmath1 vertices is simply called _ path - pairable _ , if it is @xmath2-path - pairable .",
    "the motivation of setting edge - disjoint paths between certain pairs of nodes naturally arose in the study of communication networks .",
    "there are various reasons to measure the capability of the network by its path - pairability number , that is , the maximum number of pairs of users , for which the network can provide separated communication channels without data collision . the inital problem and its graph theoretical model",
    "is discussed in @xcite .",
    "path - pairability is closely related to several other concepts , such as _ linkedness _ and _ weak - linkedness_. a graph @xmath0 is @xmath2- linked / weakly @xmath2-linked if , for every ordered set of @xmath1 vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , there exist vertex - disjoint / edge - disjoint paths @xmath7 , such that each @xmath8 is an @xmath9-path .",
    "we wish to highlight , that , while the definition of weak linkedness may resemble our earlier definition of path - pairability , repetition of the vertices in the terminal list is allowed for weak - linkedness , and it is forbidden in case of path - pairability .",
    "note that in case of linkedness , the two conventions lead to equivalent concepts . by definition ,",
    "weakly @xmath2-linked graphs are @xmath2-path - pairable , thus path - pairability is a special variant of weak - linkedness .",
    "nevertheless , the two properties differ in several respects .",
    "weakly @xmath2-linked graphs are necessarily @xmath2-edge - connected , while @xmath2-path pairable graphs only must satisfy a milder , so called _ cut - condition_.    a graph @xmath0 satisfies the _ @xmath2-cut - condition _ if , for every @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 holds .",
    "a graph @xmath0 on @xmath13 vertices satisfies the _ cut - condition _",
    ", if for every @xmath10 , @xmath14 , @xmath12 holds .    if @xmath0 is @xmath2-path - pairable , then it satisfies the @xmath2-cut condition .",
    "indeed , if there exist @xmath10 that violates the condition , terminals placed at every vertex of @xmath15 , with their pairs in @xmath16 can not be joined without subsequent use of at least one edge between the two sets .",
    "note that the cut condition states a necessary but not sufficient condition for path - pairability . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2-path - pairable graphs do not even have to be @xmath17-edge - connected .",
    "the star graph @xmath18 is one of the most illustrative counterexamples , being connected ( but not 2-edge - connected ) and @xmath19 path - pairable .",
    "faudree , gyrfs , and lehel @xcite gave examples of @xmath2-path - pairable graphs with maximum degree @xmath20 , for arbitrary values of @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the same authors proved @xcite , that the maximum degree has to grow together with the graph size in path - pairable graphs .",
    "they in fact showed , that a path - pairable graph with maximum degree @xmath21 has at most @xmath22 vertices .",
    "the result places a lower bound of @xmath23 on the maximum degree of a path - pairable graph on @xmath24 vertices .",
    "this bound is conjectured to be asymptotically sharp , though examples of path - pairable graphs with maximum degree of the right order of magnitude have yet to be explored .",
    "the best known constructions are due to kubicka , kubicki and lehel @xcite as well as mszros @xcite and have maximum degree of order of magnitude @xmath25 .",
    "the construction in @xcite is obtained by taking the cartesian product of two complete graphs . that motivated the author of this present paper to study path - pairability in the cartesian product in more details .",
    "the _ cartesian product _ of graphs @xmath0 and @xmath26 is the graph @xmath27 with vertices @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is an edge , if @xmath30 and @xmath31 or @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the cartesian product of graphs has been extensively studied in the past decades .",
    "it gave rise to important classes of graphs ; for example , the @xmath24-dimensional grid can be considered as the cartesian product of lower dimensional grids .",
    "hypercubes are well known members of this family with similar recursive structures : the cartesian product of @xmath34-dimensional and @xmath24-dimensional hypercubes is an @xmath35-dimensional one .",
    "the study of graph products leads to various deep structural problems such as invariance and inheritance of graph parameters .",
    "we mention a couple of relevant results within the field of linkedness and its variants , with no claim of being exhaustive .",
    "chiue and shieh @xcite proved , that the cartesian product of a @xmath2-connected and an @xmath36-connected graph is @xmath37-connected .",
    "similar result for edge connectivity was proved by xu and yang @xcite .",
    "inheritance of linkedness has been investigated by mszros @xcite , who proved that the cartesian product of an @xmath38-linked graph @xmath0 and a @xmath39-linked graph @xmath26 is @xmath40-linked , given that the graphs are sufficiently large in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this paper has two main objectives .",
    "we prove an inheritance theorem of path - pairability ( theorem [ pp a+b ] ) , that is similar to the inheritance of linkedness , presented in @xcite .",
    "we also prove an extension of theorem [ pp a+b ] , which states that , given sufficient space in the product graph , reasonably higher path - pairability can be achieved ( theorem [ pp oom ] ) .",
    "we mention that neither linkedness , nor weak - linkedness share this property .",

    "theorem [ pp a+b ] and [ pp oom ] concern themselves with path - pairability of the product graph @xmath27 , where path - pairabilites of the factors @xmath0 and @xmath26 are conveniently small , compared to the graph sizes @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "our other objective is the examination toward the other extremity , when @xmath6 and @xmath52 are as large as possible , that is , both @xmath0 and @xmath26 are path - pairable",
    ". the ultimate goal would be to find sufficient conditions that guarantee path - pairability of the product graph , thus offer a valuable tool to generate new path - pairable graph families .",
    "to date , very little is known about this kind of inheritance .",
    "the cartesian product of two path - pairable graphs is not necessarily path - pairable .",
    "a counter - example is presented in proposition [ stars ] . on the other hand , it is still an open and quite annoying question , if path - pairability of at least one of the multiplicands is necessary at all for path - pairability of the product graph .",
    "we believe , that the described condition is not necessary , but can not verify it by means of a counterexample , hence we state it as a conjecture .    there exist non - path - pairable graphs @xmath0 and @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 is path - pairable .",
    "kubicka , kubicki , and lehel @xcite investigated path - pairability of complete grid graphs , that is , the cartesian product of complete graphs , and proved that the two - dimensional complete grid @xmath53 of size @xmath54 is path - pairable .",
    "our objective is to improve the presented result and show , that the cartesian product of the complete bipartite graph @xmath55 with itself is path - pairable for sufficiently large even values of @xmath34 .",
    "the examined path - pairable product has @xmath56 vertices and maximum degree @xmath57 , which improves the previously discussed upper bound ( @xmath58 ) on @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "it also presents a new infinite family of path - pairable graphs , as well as gives examples of non - complete path - pairable graphs , whose cartesian product is path - pairable as well .",
    "[ m ] the product graph @xmath61 is path - pairable for even values of @xmath34 , if @xmath62 .",
    "we follow the notation of @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we recall definitions of the mainly used concepts .",
    "a @xmath0-layer @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) of the cartesian product @xmath27 is the subgraph induced by the set of vertices @xmath65 .",
    "an @xmath26-layer is defined analogously .",
    "we call edges of @xmath27 lying in @xmath0-layers vertical while edges lying in @xmath26-layers are called horizontal .",
    "unless it is misleading , we also use the notation @xmath66 and @xmath67 for layers corresponding to @xmath68 .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite for further details on product graphs . for a comprehensive survey of results concerning path - pairability",
    ", we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath69 denote the set of @xmath70 ( arbitrarily chosen and paired ) terminals in @xmath27 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath71 .",
    "we first prove the theorem in the `` base '' case , when no @xmath0-layer contains terminals belonging to @xmath72 or more pairs .",
    "the assumption in fact implies that no layer contains more than @xmath73 terminals .",
    "our goal is to join terminals lying on the same @xmath0-layer , while choosing a `` pseudopair '' @xmath74 of every remaining terminal @xmath75 such that @xmath76 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath77 denotes the real terminal pair of @xmath75 ( such that @xmath78 ) , we choose @xmath79 , such that @xmath74 and @xmath79 are on the same @xmath26-layer .",
    "we join @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 pairs for all @xmath83 terminal pairs by edge - disjoint paths .",
    "the union of such path - triples will join the initially set terminal pairs .",
    "we describe the above steps in more details as follows .",
    "take a @xmath0-layer @xmath63 @xmath84 with terminals @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "observe that , if @xmath87 where @xmath88 , then @xmath63 contains at least @xmath47 pairs of terminals .",
    "for an unmatched terminal @xmath75 of @xmath63 , we choose a pseudo pair @xmath89 , such that different terminals get different pseudo pairs and @xmath90 contains no other terminal , but it contains the pseudo - pair of @xmath77 , the terminal pair of @xmath75 . since @xmath41 , we can freely assign terminal - free vertical layers for the pseudo pairs of each pair of the terminals . moreover , this assignment can be carried out even with the additional constraint , that no vertical layer will contain more than @xmath39 pairs of pseudo pairs",
    ". now every @xmath0-layer contains at most @xmath38 pairs of terminals or terminal - pseudo - pair pairs . using the fact the @xmath0-layers are @xmath38-path - pairable",
    ", we can assign edge - disjoint paths joining the pairs within every one of the layers .",
    "having done that , the appropriate @xmath91 pseudopairs can paired within their @xmath26-layers by an arbitrary path .",
    "that completes the proof of the base case .",
    "we mention that our presented technique wastes a lots of potential in the pairing of the pseudopairs . using that @xmath26 , and",
    "so every @xmath26-layer is @xmath39-path - pairable , @xmath92 additional empty @xmath26-layers are sufficient to finish the pairing , hence fewer @xmath26-layers suffice to contain the pesudopairs .",
    "the lower bounds on the graph sizes in the theorem can be improved to @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the discussed case .",
    "we continue our proof with the initial weaker bounds .",
    "now we turn to examination of the general case . as @xmath95 , at most 3 @xmath0-layers contain @xmath72 or more types of terminals .",
    "our goal is to reduce our problem to the base case , by redistributing the terminals among the @xmath0-layers .",
    "it will be done by assigning pseudopairs for each terminal within its original @xmath26-layer .",
    "observe that , as the solution of the base case contains a horizontal shift , the combination of the initial redistribution , and the solution of the base case will use no vertical or horizontal edge more than once . for the redistribution of the terminals ,",
    "we follow a case - by - case analysis .    1 .",
    "assume first , that @xmath63 is the only @xmath0-layer that contains @xmath96 terminals belonging to different pairs , where @xmath97 .",
    "it means there are at most @xmath98 terminals outside of @xmath63 .",
    "we claim that one of these layers contains at most @xmath99 terminals , else the graph @xmath100 would contain at least @xmath101 terminals , clearly contradicting our previous observation . take a @xmath0-layer @xmath102 with the above property .",
    "we want to choose @xmath103 of the terminals in @xmath63 ( if their pair is in @xmath63 as well , then we choose both of them ) and assign them pseudopairs in @xmath102 , together with vertical paths joining the terminals to their pseudopairs .",
    "note that we can not assign a pseudopair to a vertex that already contains a terminal .",
    "the terminals initially placed in @xmath102 prohibit the assigment of pseudo pairs for at most @xmath38 of the terminals ( singleton or paired ) of @xmath63 , that is , at least @xmath104 terminals can get pseudopairs , while we only needed @xmath103 . note also that the total number of types of terminals and pseudopairs in @xmath102 is at most @xmath105 after the redistributing step , as prescribed in the base case .",
    "we can now apply the solution of the base case on a new set of terminals , where pseudopairs take the place of their initial terminals .",
    "if two @xmath0-layers contain at least @xmath72 types of terminals , the remaining terminals occupy at most @xmath106 @xmath0-layers , that is , there exists at least @xmath107 @xmath0-layers that are free of terminals .",
    "if @xmath108 , both layers contain exatly @xmath72 terminals of different pairs .",
    "one can arbitrarily pick a pair , shift them vertically just as in the previous case , completing our task . if @xmath109 , every @xmath26 is at least 2-path - pairable , hence we can arbitrarily define for a terminal @xmath75 a pseudopair @xmath74 in @xmath110 , such that 1",
    ".   @xmath111 contains no terminal and contains at most @xmath38 pseudopairs at the end of the procedure , 2 .",
    "@xmath80 pairs are joined within @xmath112 by edge - disjoint horizontal paths .",
    "+ indeed , to satisfy the first condition , observe that we have at most @xmath113 terminals that we distribute among @xmath107 empty layers without any particular constraint ( remember , here a terminal and its pair do not have to get pseudopairs assigned to the same @xmath0-layer ) , thus a balanced distribution with at most @xmath114 terminals can be chosen .",
    "the second condition can be guaranteeed by 2-path - pairability , as we assign at most 2 pseudopairs within an @xmath26-layer .",
    "3 .   the case with three overloaded layers ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) works similarly to the previous one .",
    "observe first that in the examined case @xmath118 , hence @xmath119 .",
    "remember , that @xmath71 , thus @xmath120 , which yields @xmath121 as well . by pigeon - hole principal",
    ", we have at least @xmath122 empty @xmath0-layers at disposal , each of them expected to receive @xmath123 pseudopairs on average .",
    "since @xmath121 , the at most three paths can be established within every @xmath26-layer , that completes the examination of the case and so the proof as well .    before proving theorem [ pp oom ] , we state that the bound of theorem [ pp a+b ] gives the right order of magnitude of path - pairability for certain classes of graphs .",
    "[ stars ] the cartesian product @xmath124 is at most @xmath125-path - pairable .    let @xmath126 and @xmath127 denote the sets of vertices of degree two in an arbitrary column and an arbitrary row not contanining the unique vertex of degree @xmath44 ( denoted by @xmath128 ) and let @xmath129 be an additional vertex of degree two . we denote the unique vertex of the intersection @xmath130 by @xmath131 .",
    "we place terminals in @xmath132 such that @xmath129 and @xmath131 form a pair , as well as the unique vertices of degree @xmath72 and @xmath133 ( denoted by @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) form another .",
    "observe that paths that join the above two pairs both use either the edge between @xmath134 and @xmath128 or between @xmath135 and @xmath128 , hence the pairing can not be achieved .",
    "we believe that , with a somewhat longer and more cumbersome analysis , one can actually prove that @xmath136 . nevertheless , the actual proof is bound to require a lengthy case - by - case analysis , that we do not consider particularly interesting and do not investigate .",
    "now we turn to the proof of theorem [ pp oom ] .",
    "we use the same techniques as in the previous proof .",
    "again , we may assume @xmath137 .",
    "if no @xmath0-layer contains more than @xmath38 different types of terminals , we can join the pairs that share a @xmath0-layer , and assign pseudopairs to the terminals having their pairs on a different @xmath0-layer , just as we did in the base case of the previous proof .",
    "the pseudopairs can be chosen , such that    * their @xmath26-layers contain no terminal , * pseduopairs of a pair of terminals are located on the same @xmath26-layer , and * every @xmath26-layer contains at most @xmath39 pairs of pseudopairs .",
    "the initial terminals occupy at most @xmath138 @xmath26-layers .",
    "we need and additional empty @xmath26-layer for every one of the @xmath47 pairs , that is guaranteed by the condition @xmath139 . pairing of the pseudopairs",
    "can be carried out within the @xmath26-layers again , we are far from an optimal solution , as an @xmath26-layer is capable of joining up to @xmath39 pairs of terminals , hence similar theorem with a stronger condition on the graphs size can be proved . for the sake of convenience and clarity",
    ", we stick to the weaker variant and proceed by investigating the general case .",
    "if @xmath140-layers contain more than @xmath38-types of terminals , observe first that @xmath141 , else @xmath27 would consist of at least @xmath142 terminals , contradicting @xmath46 .",
    "it means , that in every vertical layer that contains a terminal @xmath75 , we can assign a pseudopair @xmath74 and - using that @xmath26 is @xmath39-path - pairable , and so is every vertical layer in @xmath27- define edge disjoint @xmath80 paths for every @xmath75 .",
    "we can distribute the pseudopairs among the initially empty horizontal layers equally , such that none of them contains more than @xmath38 pseudopairs .",
    "indeed , we have at least @xmath138 empty @xmath0-layers at our disposal and have to redistribute @xmath138 terminals in total . having done this , we can join the pseudopairs as described in the above base case .",
    "corollary [ pp ab ] follows trivially from theorem [ pp oom ] .",
    "we show , that the bound presented in corollary [ pp ab ] is also sharp , up to a constant factor .",
    "that is , the order magnitude in the inheritance of path - pairability can not be expanded more than indicated in theorem [ pp oom ] , by simply providing an abudance of space in the product graph .",
    "to prove our claim , we first make the following observation : if @xmath143 and @xmath144 subsets violate the cut - condition , that is , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the product set @xmath147 does not necessarily have the same condition . in order to generate violating product sets ,",

    "we construct our example by a graph operation called `` blowing - up '' .",
    "let @xmath153 , and define @xmath154 as an equally blown up graph of the path @xmath155 of size @xmath24 , that is , @xmath156 , where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are connected , if either @xmath159 , or @xmath160 ( modulo @xmath161 ) .",
    "in other words , we take a path on @xmath2 vertices , replace every vertex by a complete graph @xmath162 , and every edge of the initial path by the edge set of a complete bipartite graph @xmath55 between the two cliques .",
    "we use the notation @xmath163 and refer to the set as the @xmath164th class of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath154 is @xmath165-path - pairable , if @xmath166 .",
    "given a distribution of @xmath165 pairs of vertices , we can carry out pairing by starting at one end of the path , greedily joining terminals to vertices of the consecutive class , and finishing the joining of terminals within the classes . for a terminal @xmath75",
    ", we will assign several @xmath167 pseudopairs in the consecutive classes until we finally pair one with the appropriate @xmath77 pair .",
    "we start by pairing terminals that lie in the same class by direct edges of the cliques . from now on we may assume that , for every pair @xmath83 , one of the terminals is closer to the left end of the path , hence it will be encountered earlier in our left - to - right sweeping algorithm than its pair .",
    "being at class @xmath168 , the consecutive class @xmath169 contains at most @xmath34 terminals .",
    "if some of them have appropriate pseudopair in @xmath170 , they can be joined by direct edges ( here we are using that path - pairability prohibits repeated terminal assignment of a vertex ) .",
    "then , the remaining terminals of @xmath170 can be assigned a new pseudopair in @xmath169 , maintaining the condition that a vertex @xmath171 hosts at most @xmath34 terminals and pseudopairs that have not been paired .",
    "having visited at most @xmath172 terminals , this condition can be easily maintained using hall s matching theorem . having reached @xmath173 terminals , we must have encountered at least a pairs , that is , the number of still unmatched terminals is at most @xmath174 , thus our above reasoning works just as well as before .    now let @xmath175 and @xmath176 , such that @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath143 and @xmath144 be formed by @xmath179 and @xmath180 consecutive classes , starting at the left end of the blown - up paths .",
    "the sets @xmath181 and @xmath182 satisfy the conditions of proposition [ doubleviolate ] , thus @xmath27 is not @xmath183-path - pairable , regardless of the initial sizes of @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "that justifies our claim .",
    "let us denote the two classes of the bipartite graph @xmath55 by @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "we introduce further notation for certain sets of the vertices in the product graph @xmath186 as follows : @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 .",
    "we will refer to these sets as _",
    "classes _ of @xmath0 .",
    "we set a cyclic order of the four classes clockwise .",
    "references to _ next class _ and _ previous class _ are translated in accordance with that given cyclic order .",
    "we label the @xmath165 elements of each class by @xmath83 pairs , where @xmath191 and @xmath191 .",
    "we introduce the expression of _ shipping _ a terminal or pseudopair @xmath75 to a vertex or pseudopair @xmath77 , by which we mean that we establish an @xmath192 path @xmath193 between the two vertices , such that @xmath193 shares no edge with any other path .",
    "we will join our terminals by shipping them several times , that is , taking the union of several paths defined between appropriate sequences of pseudopairs .",
    "having read the proof of theorem [ pp a+b ] and theorem [ pp oom ] , this method is likely to look familiar for the reader .",
    "a vertex is said to _ host _ a terminal , if the terminal is shipped to the vertex at some point during our pairing procedure .    given a pairing of the vertices ,",
    "we carry out the joining of the terminals in three phases named : _ swarming _ , _ line - up _ and _ final match_. for a pair of terminals of @xmath0 , we first ship them to the same class ( swarming ) , then send them forward to the same row / column of the next class ( line - up ) .",
    "finally , we join the to paths by their newly established ends with a single vertex of the next class ( final match ) .      in this phase",
    ", we ship one terminal of each pair to the class of its partner .",
    "if a pair lies with both vertices within a class , they simply skip the swarming phase .",
    "a terminal @xmath83 , belonging to class @xmath194 and heading to @xmath195 , shall follow the path @xmath196 , where @xmath197 denotes the appropriate vertex of @xmath195 and addition is calculated modulo @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , we ship @xmath83 to @xmath198 via the path @xmath199 . should @xmath83 be shipped to @xmath200 , we allocate it the path @xmath201 where @xmath197 belongs to @xmath195 and @xmath202 belongs to @xmath200 . terminals belonging to other classes",
    "will be shipped by the same rules , increasing the appropriate coordinate by 1 at the first step , and increasing the other one by 2 in the second step , if applicable .",
    "getting shipped via paths of length two is always carried out clockwise .",
    "one can easily verify , that the above arrangment of paths assures that , if @xmath203 , no edge is being utilized twice during the swarming phase .",
    "we now choose the terminal to be shipped for each pair , such that at the end of the swarming phase , every class hosts exactly @xmath204 pairs . starting with an arbitrary selection ,",
    "we can assume without loss of generality , that @xmath194 hosts the most pairs , and that at least one terminal @xmath205 received its pair @xmath131 from a class hosting less than @xmath204 pairs .",
    "shipping @xmath129 to the class of @xmath131 instead balances the distribution of the pairs .",
    "repetition of the previous step leads to an equal distribution .",
    "we define @xmath206 with @xmath207 , and a new edge set @xmath208 by deleting those edges from @xmath209 we used in the swarming phase .",

    "assume on the contrary that @xmath10 of size at most @xmath2 violates the condition .",
    "we proceed by case - by - case analysis .",
    "case 1 : :    if @xmath249 , @xmath15 must contain an    additional vertex , that is , @xmath250 .",

    "it completes the proof .",
    "it has been known for some time , that not only linkedness and weak - linkedness force high - connectivity and edge - connectivity of the graph , but that sufficiently large connectivity and edge - connectivity imply linkedness and weak - linkedness , respectively .",

    "the question regarding the path - pairability number of larger @xmath24 dimensional affine and projective grids , that is , the cartesian product of @xmath257 paths or @xmath257 cycles has not been answered either . it can be derived rather easily from theorem [ pp oom ] , that sufficiently large @xmath257-dimensional projective grids are @xmath268-path - pairable .",
    "similar result concerning affine grids can be obtained .",
