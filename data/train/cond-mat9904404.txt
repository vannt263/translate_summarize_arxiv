    "<S> intercalation of alkali metals in the @xmath4 solids yields various structural compounds @xmath5 ( x=1 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) with different physical property.@xcite among these , the superconducting compounds , @xmath6 , has attracted considerable interest.@xcite in this system , the fcc lattice parameter and band filling are tunable by changing the intercalants , @xmath7 goes up with increasing lattice parameter,@xcite while it rapidly decreases when the nominal valence ( n ) shifts from the half - filling n=3 of @xmath8 band.@xcite    the study was then extended to the alkali - earth series of @xmath9 , @xcite the electrons are introduced by intercalation of alkali - earth metals into the next lowest unoccupied molecular orbital with @xmath10 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting compounds with various structures and critical temperatures were prepared ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13).@xcite such tolerance for the @xmath4 molecular valence in @xmath10 superconductors makes a striking contrast with the strict constraint for the valence state in the case of @xmath8 superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> the rare - earth metals were also intercalated into the @xmath4 solids , but only one phase @xmath14 ( re = yb , sm ) was discovered so far.@xcite in this system , the basic structure of @xmath14 is face - centered cubic , but the cation vacancy ordering in tetrahedral sites leads to a superstructure accompanied with slight lattice deformation from cubic to orthorhombic . </S>",
    "<S> the re cations occupying the octahedral sites experience off - center displacements since one out of every eight tetrahedral sites in the subcell is vacant . such vacancy - ordered structure of @xmath14 can be understood within a simple electrostatic energy model.@xcite in this paper , we report synthesis and structure of a novel sm - intercalated compound @xmath0 , which is isostructural with bcc @xmath1 ( a = k , ba).@xcite it suggests that the cation vacancy ordering could not exist in the highly doped @xmath4 with rare earth metals . </S>",

    "<S> samples of @xmath0 was synthesized by reacting stoichiometric amount of powers of sm and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a quartz tube with mixed powder inside was sealed under high vacuum of about @xmath15 torr . </S>",
    "<S> the sample of @xmath0 were calcined at 550 @xmath16 for 216 hours with intermediate grindings of two times . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction(xrd ) measurements were carried out with synchrotron radiation at the photon factory of the national laboratory for high energy physics ( kek - pf , tsukuba ) . </S>",

    "<S> rietveld refinements for the xrd patterns were carried out using fullprof-98 . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction showed that all samples were single phase , which is also confirmed by the single peak feature of the pentagonal pinch @xmath17 mode in the raman spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> raman scattering experiments were carried out using the 632.8 nm line of a he - ne laser in the brewster angle backscattering geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering light was detected with a dilor xy multichannel spectrometer using a spectral resolution of 3 @xmath18 . in order to obtain good raman spectra , the samples were ground and pressed into pellets with pressure of about 20 @xmath19 , which were sealed in pyrex tubes under a high vacuum of @xmath20 torr .    </S>",
    "<S> resistivity measurements were carried out using four - probe method . </S>",
    "<S> electrical contacts of less than 2 @xmath21 resistance were established by silver paste . </S>",

    "<S> . refinement of 220 peaks yielded an intensity r factor of @xmath24=9.9% and @xmath25=9.4% , and the following coordinates : c1 at 0.0660 , 0.0 , 0.3201 ; c2 at 0.1320 , 0.1070 , 0.2796 ; c3 at 0.0660 , 0.2140 , 0.2392 ; and sm at 0.0 , 0.5 , 0.2749 . </S>",
    "<S> mean - square thermal amplitudes of the isotropic debye - waller factors were refined to 0.016 and 0.103 @xmath26 for c and sm , respectively , and all samarium sites were found to be occupied . the refined lattice constant , a=10.890  , however , is significantly smaller than measured values for @xmath27 and @xmath28,@xcite @xmath2,@xcite and @xmath29,@xcite and suggests a 9.43 @xmath30 nearest - neighbor separation for the molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic coordinates of c1 , c2 , c3 and sm are nearly the same as that of @xmath1 ( a = k , rb , cs , and ba).@xcite    for the low sm - doped @xmath4 , @xmath31 is isostructural with @xmath32,@xcite and different from the fcc @xmath6 ( a = k , rb).@xcite in this structure , the fcc - based subcell of four @xmath4 molecules has sm cations occupying all four octehedral ( o ) interstitial sites but only seven of the eight tetrahedral ( t ) sites . the unoccupied site alternates between adjacent t sites in each direction , leading to an unit - cell doubling with eight ordered vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the o - site sm cations are displaced from the centers of their interstices towards the nearest neighbor vacancy , effectively reducing the nearest neighbor coordination of @xmath4 anions around the o - site cation from six to three . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the unit cell there are three types of @xmath4 molecules . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the @xmath14 , the highly sm - doped @xmath0 is isostructural with @xmath1 ( a = k , rb , cs , and ba).@xcite it suggests that further intercalation of sm into @xmath4 solids leads to disappearance of cation - vacancy ordering and formation of a cation - disordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the number of interstitial sites increases from three per @xmath4 in a faced - centred cubic ( fcc ) structure to six in the bcc structure . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the distinction between octahedral and tetrahedral sites is removed in the bcc structure , all interstitial sites becoming equivalent with distorted tetrahedral symmetry . for the @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> the vacancies create three inequivalent types of @xmath4 anions . </S>",
    "<S> each anion rotates about an internal axis to maximize the number of pentagon oriented towards the surronding cations . in the highly sm - doped @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> all interstitial sites are filled by six samarium atoms . </S>",
    "<S> all @xmath4 balls are equivalent and orientationally uniform , and all the tetrahedral holes are surrounded by two pentagons and two hexagons .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows room temperature raman spectrum for the polycrystalline sample of @xmath0 . in the spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> only one peak of pentagonal pinch @xmath17 mode is observed , providing an evidence that the sample is a single phase . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees fairly well with the x - ray diffraction patterns . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthy to note that the raman spectrum of @xmath0 is amazingly similar to that of @xmath2,@xcite suggesting that the electronic states of @xmath0 is similar to that of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the positions ( @xmath33 ) and halfwidths ( @xmath34 ) of the raman modes observed are listed in table i. for comparison , the lines for pure @xmath4 and @xmath2 are included in table i. the frequencies of the two @xmath3 derived modes are 505.5 and 1371 @xmath18 , respectively . which are different from 498.3 and 1432.8 @xmath18 observed for the corresponding @xmath3 modes in @xmath31.@xcite it also provides a direct evidence for an existence of new phase in sm - doped @xmath4 system . it is seen in table </S>",
    "<S> i that the frequencies of the two @xmath3 modes are nearly the same as those in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that @xmath4 in @xmath0 is hexavalent , being in a fair agreement with a simple expectation assuming that sm cation is divalent . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the results of near - edge and extended x - ray absorption fine structure in @xmath32,@xcite and raman scattering results of @xmath31,@xcite in which sm cation is comfirmed to be divalent .    </S>",
    "<S> two theoretical calculations based the local density approximation have shown a strong hybridization between the alkaline - earth - atom states and the @xmath4 @xmath35 states.@xcite recent photoemission studies have also indicated the presence of a hybrid band with incomplete charge transfer from alkaline - earth metals to @xmath4 , as a consequence of the competition between covalent @xmath36 bonding and ionic contribution.@xcite the same frequency of the @xmath17 mode as that in @xmath2 , which is known as a sensitive probe for the degree of charge transfer on @xmath4 molecule , indicates that the hybridization between sm atom and @xmath4 molecules could exist in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the size of the divalent samarium , 1.18  , placed at ( 0.22 , 0.5 , 0 ) requires a lattice constant of about 11.5 @xmath30 assuming spherically symmetric molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively small lattice constant measured also may indicate strong orbital overlap between the neighboring molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this hybridization may play an essential role for a larger raman downshift of the pentagonal pinch @xmath17 mode than that expected by the simple relation between raman shift and charge transfer widely observed in @xmath37.@xcite    in the table i , the positions and halfwidths were obtained by fitting the experimental data with lorentzian line shape . </S>",
    "<S> it is easily seen that the lowest frequency @xmath38 modes are splitted into several components . </S>",
    "<S> the similar behavior has been observed in single crystal @xmath39 at low temperature@xcite and in @xmath40 ( x=4 and 6).@xcite @xmath41 mode is apparently split into five components in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig.2 shows the results of a line - shape analysis for @xmath41 mode . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that the five - fold degeneracy is completely lift . </S>",
    "<S> this splitting of @xmath41 mode in @xmath0 is unexpected since the group theoretical consideration predicts a splitting into two in the space group @xmath22@xmath23 ( @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting might suggest a symmetry lowering which is not detected in the x - ray diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> this type of disagreement between microscopic spectroscopy and structural analysis was observed in @xmath43@xcite and @xmath2.@xcite from table i , we can find that the positions for most of modes are the same , and the similar splitting is observed in @xmath0 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly indicates that @xmath0 and @xmath2 have a similar crystal structure and electronic states .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 show the temperature dependence of resistivity for the sample @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> no superconducting transition is observed at the temperature down to 4.2 k. a minimum resistivity appears at about 180 k. the temperature coefficient of resistivity is positive over 180 k , while is negative below 180 k. the data in fig.3 are fitted by the following formula : @xmath44 where a , b , c , and d are the fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that data can be well fitted over the whole temperature range of 4.2 - 300 k by the formula . the first item in the formula </S>",
    "<S> is written according to the granular metal theory , in which the @xmath45 is proportional to the @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear - t item is used to fit the metallic behavior at the high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig.3 plots the same data as @xmath45 vs @xmath46 , and almost shows a linear relation below 180 k. it suggests that the transport is dominated by the granular - metal theory . </S>",
    "<S> stepniak et al . </S>",
    "<S> have reported that the thin film samples of @xmath47 can be described within the framework of granular metal theory.@xcite the sample @xmath0 shows a weak localization behavior at low temperature and the ratio @xmath48 is only 1.7 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the transport at low temperature can be explained by the granular metal theory . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the sample @xmath0 is metallic . </S>",
    "<S> this is in apparent contradiction to the insulating electronic structure if the charge complete transfer from the rare - earth divalent sm atom to @xmath4 molecules could result in the full occupation of the @xmath10 band . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic behavior of @xmath0 suggests that there could exist a hybridization between rare - earth sm @xmath49 orbitals and @xmath4 @xmath50 @xmath35 orbitals , being similar to the case of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in the case of @xmath2 , the theoretical calculation based on the local - density approximation shows that the hybridization between the ba atom s states and the @xmath4 @xmath35 states is essential for the metallic electronic structure.@xcite in addition , the same raman shift of the @xmath17 pinch mode for @xmath0 and @xmath2 also provides a direct evidence for a hybridization between sm atoms and @xmath4 molecules . </S>",
    "<S> in order to further confirm the hybridization in @xmath0 , a theoretical calculation or photoemission study is necessary .    in summary , we synthesized a novel fulleride @xmath0 , which was characterized by x - ray diffraction , raman scattering and resistivity measurement . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 adopts body - centered cubic structure , being similar to that of @xmath1 ( a = k , rb , ba ) . </S>",
    "<S> raman spectrum of @xmath0 is strikingly similar to that of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the same raman shift of the @xmath17 pinch mode in @xmath0 and @xmath2 suggests that sm is divalent and there exists a hybridization between rare - earth sm atom and the @xmath4 molecules , which could be responsible for the metallic behavior of @xmath0 observed by resistivity measurement . </S>",
    "<S> a weak t - linear metallic behavior is observed down to 180 k , the resistivity data at low temperature can be explained by the granular - metal theory . </S>"
