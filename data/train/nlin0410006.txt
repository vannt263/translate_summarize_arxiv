    "this is due to the fact that the fingers touch the line @xmath86 at a point ( a consequence of parametric resonance and the fact that @xmath86 is stable ) . for a given finger with index @xmath124 , we have that either @xmath145 as @xmath146 and it vanishes for larger values of @xmath142 or @xmath147 as @xmath148 , in which case it never vanishes .",

    "the horizontal and vertical lines which separate the different regions intersect on the parabola at the point @xmath160 . as @xmath143 decreases , the intersection point slides down the parabola towards the origin and the unstable fingers in region ( i ) stabilize and enter region ( ii ) .",

    "floor and ceiling refer to rounding the the nearest integer less than and greater than the current value , respectively .",
    "essentially , follows from the fact that none of the fingers live in region ( i ) for these parameter values .",
    "this criterion is analogous to the nonresonance stability criterion @xmath174 for forced turbulence in three - dimensional rotating , stably stratified flow in the boussinesq approximation@xcite .",
    "( note that their equation for the buoyancy differs from ours . ) for @xmath175 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2n ] , this corresponds to @xmath176 .",
    "the second stability criterion is that all of the fingers will live in region ( ii ) when @xmath177 within this window , the flow is stable for slight perturbations in @xmath3 .",
    "this means counter rotation stabilizes the flow , when the brunt - visl frequency is sufficiently low .",
    "the case @xmath156 , that is when the wave vector of the kelvin wave is parallel to the axis of rotation , also can be analyzed analytically .",
    "@xmath178 it follows that no exponential growth of the solution of will occur for parameter values satisfying @xmath179      we perform a separate investigation for the case @xmath180 , that is , when the wave vector lies in the plane of the flow . as was the case for @xmath181 ,",
    "the equations decouple such that the equations for @xmath134 are independent of @xmath182 and @xmath68 , and vice - versa .",
    "the equations for @xmath134 are exactly those for the lans@xmath0  model , and the equations for @xmath182 and @xmath68 can be rewritten as a single schrdinger equation : @xmath183 where @xmath184 and overhead dot denotes a time derivative . for the eb case , @xmath185 , and the solutions are purely periodic and bounded , i.e. , stable .",
    "in fact , this case is critically stable in the sense that any slight perturbation of the wave vector in the third dimension ( @xmath186 ) could result in kelvin waves with exponentially growing amplitudes @xcite . for the laeb@xmath0  model , is once again a floquet problem .",
    "comparison of numerical simulations of the full @xmath187 system in and that in yield exactly the same growth rates over the same parameter ranges .",

    "they arise because of the introduction of the length scale @xmath5 and can not be removed by rescaling the other parameters in the problem .",

    "coursening at the correlation length @xmath5 in the turbulence model may be exhibiting different effects than for small eccentricity , because of the higher anisotropy of these flows .",

    "perhaps another version of the model  one which would allow for strong anisotropy in the statistical correlations of turbulent lagrangian fluctuations with their mean trajectories  would not show such pronounced effects at high eccentricity .    additionally , the laeb@xmath0  model introduces a band of unstable flows in the parameter regime @xmath180 , where the wave vector lies in the plane of the flow .",
