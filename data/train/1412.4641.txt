    "a search is presented for standard model ( sm ) production of four top quarks ( @xmath0 ) in pp collisions in the lepton + jets channel performed by the cms collaboration @xcite . the cross section for sm @xmath0 ) production at the lhc",
    "is predicted , at leading order , to be extremely small : @xmath3 1 fb at @xmath4 tev @xcite .    in many models beyond the sm ( bsm ) involving supersymmetry , massive coloured bosons , higgs boson or top quark compositeness , or extra dimensions ,",
    "@xmath5 is enhanced @xcite . in certain regions of bsm parameter space ,",
    "these final states have kinematics similar to those of sm @xmath0 production .",
    "in such cases , reinterpretation of an upper limit on sm production of @xmath0 has the potential to constrain bsm theories .",
    "moreover , in direct searches for these bsm signatures , sm production of @xmath0 can be a background .",
    "hence , experimental constraints on @xmath5 have the potential to enhance the discovery reach of such searches .",
    "the selections require the presence of one well - identified and isolated muon or electron with @xmath6 30 gev and with respective muon or electron @xmath7 2.1 or 2.5 .",
    "jets are required to have @xmath6 30 gev and @xmath7 2.5 .",
    "all events are required to have the number of selected jets ( @xmath8 ) to be at least six .",
    "events are required to have the number of jets identified as originating from a b quark ( @xmath9 ) to be at least two .",
    "the @xmath10 of an event is defined as the scalar sum of the @xmath11 of all the selected jets in the event .",
    "events are also required to have @xmath12 400 gev and @xmath13 30 gev .",
    "in the lepton + jets channel , the presence of three jet - decaying top quarks in @xmath0events can be exploited to distinguish such events from @xmath14background events , which contain only one jet - decaying top quark .",
    "the challenge in the kinematic reconstruction of such top quarks in an event containing many jets is to find correct selections of three jets that arise from any single top quark when many incorrect three - jet combinations are possible .",
    "such correctly selected combinations are referred to as `` correct trijets '' , while combinations containing one or more jets not originating from the same top quark are referred to as `` incorrect trijets '' .",
    "the large number of incorrect trijets in signal and background events motivates the use of mva methods to distinguish between correct and incorrect trijets by combining information from a set of input variables .",
    "six variables which discriminate between correct and incorrect trijets are combined in a boosted decision tree algorithm ( @xmath15 ) using the tmva package @xcite .",
    "the trijet with the largest value of @xmath15 discriminant is removed from the event , and the @xmath15 discriminant of the trijet of the remaining jets with highest value ( @xmath16 ) is used to distinguish between @xmath0and @xmath14events .",
    "distributions in this variable , in @xmath8 and in @xmath9 in data and simulation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcvar ] . the reduced event ( re )",
    "is constructed by subtracting the jets contained in the highest @xmath15 ranking trijet .",
    "two variables based on the re are ( i ) @xmath17 , which is the @xmath10 of the re and ( ii ) @xmath18 , which is the invariant mass of the system comprising all the jets in the re . because @xmath0events can contain up to ten hard jets from top quark decays , while @xmath14events contain up to four , the following variables based on jet activity of the event possess discrimination power : ( i ) @xmath8 , ( ii ) @xmath19 , ( iii ) @xmath20 , ( iv ) @xmath21 , ( v ) @xmath22 , and ( vi ) @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath19 variable is the @xmath10 of the b - tagged jets . in the @xmath20 ratio ,",
    "@xmath24 is the scalar sum of the total momenta of the selected jets .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath10 of the four leading jets to the @xmath10 of the other jets is defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 variables represent , respectively , the @xmath11 values of jets of 5th and 6th largest @xmath11 . the multiplicity of b - tagged jets is also used in the discriminant .",
    "the ten variables described are combined using a second , event - level bdt ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "the systematic uncertainties considered in this analysis are separated into two categories : ( i ) those that affect the normalisations of the @xmath25 discriminant distributions of both signal and backgrounds and ( ii ) those that affect the form of the distributions of just the backgrounds .",
    "the normalisations are affected by the uncertainty in integrated luminosity of the data and the theoretical cross sections of the signal and background processes .",
    "an uncertainty in the integrated luminosity of 2.6% is included @xcite . the uncertainty in the @xmath14cross section is expected to dominate , and is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath32  ( factorisation and renormalisation scales ) and",
    "@xmath33  ( pdf ) . a range of theoretical and experimental sources of systematic uncertainty can affect the form of the distributions of the @xmath25 discriminant .",
    "as @xmath14is the dominant background , systematic effects on the form of the distributions are considered only for @xmath14events . the impact of contributions from higher - order corrections in the @xmath14simulation is quantified by comparing alternative @xmath14samples that are generated with the renormalisation and factorisation scales simultaneously changed up and down by a factor of two relative to the nominal @xmath14sample .",
    "the matching of partons originating from the matrix element to the jets from the parton showers is performed according to the mlm prescription @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty arising from this prescription is estimated by changing the minimum @xmath34 measure between partons by factors of 0.5 and 2.0 and the jet matching threshold by factors of 0.75 and 1.5 . to evaluate the uncertainty due to imperfect knowledge of the jes , jer , b tagging , and lepton - identification efficiencies , and the cross section for minimum - bias production used in the pileup - reweighting procedure in simulation , the input value of each parameter is changed by @xmath35 standard deviation of its uncertainty .",
    "a systematic uncertainty due to the imperfect knowledge of the contribution from the @xmath36component in @xmath14events is also estimated .",
    "no significant excess of events to represent sm @xmath0production is observed above the background prediction .",
    "therefore , an upper limit on @xmath37 is set by performing a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to the distributions in the @xmath25 discriminant for signal and background in the six event categories described in section [ sec : bdt ] .",
    "the modified frequentist @xmath38 approach @xcite using the asymptotic approximation is adopted to measure the upper limit using the roostats package @xcite .",
    "the limit calculated at a 95% confidence level ( cl ) on the production cross section @xmath37 is @xmath39 fb , where a limit of @xmath2 fb is expected . these limits are approximately 25 @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "a search for events containing four top quarks was performed using data collected with the cms detector in lepton + jets final states at @xmath4 tev , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb@xmath1 .",
