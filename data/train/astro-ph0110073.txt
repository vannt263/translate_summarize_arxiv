    "the standard picture of cosmological structure formation suggests that any visible object forms in a gravitational potential of _ dark matter halos_. therefore , a detailed description of dark halo clustering is the most basic step toward understanding the clustering of visible objects in the universe . for this purpose , many theoretical models for halo clustering have been developed and then tested against extensive numerical simulations .",
    "first , i will describe our most recent theoretical model for clustering of dark matter halos ( hamana , yoshida , suto & evrard 2001b ) .",
    "in particular , we focus on their high - redshift clustering where the past light - cone effect is important",
    ". then i will show that our model predictions are in good agreement with the result from a light - cone output of the hubble volume simulation ( evrard et al .",
    "finally i will discuss a fundamental difficulty in relating the halo model to clusters of galaxies .",
    "my conclusion is that we already have a reliable empirical model for the halo clustering , but that we need to understand what are the clusters of galaxies , especially at high redshifts , before attempting _",
    "precision cosmology _ with clusters of galaxies .",
    "as emphasized by suto et al.(1999 ) , for instance , observations of high - redshift objects are carried out only through the past light - cone defined at @xmath2 , and the corresponding theoretical modeling should properly take account of a variety of physical effects which are briefly summarized below .",
    "assuming the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , the linear power spectrum of the mass density fluctuations is computed by solving the boltzmann equation for systems of cdm , baryons , photons and ( usually massless for simplicity ) neutrinos . the resulting spectrum @xmath3 in real space is specified by a set of cosmological parameters including the density parameter @xmath4 , the baryon density parameter @xmath5 , and the hubble constant @xmath6 in units of 100/km / s / mpc , and the cosmological constant @xmath7 .",
    "then one can obtain its nonlinear counterpart in real space , @xmath8 by adopting a fitting formula of peacock & doods ( 1996 ) .",
    "the most important ingredient in describing the clustering of halos is their biasing properties .",
    "the mass - dependent halo bias model was developed by mo & white ( 1996 ) on the basis of the extended press - schechter theory . subsequently jing ( 1998 ) and",
    "sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) improved their bias model so as to more accurately reproduce the mass - dependence of bias computed from @xmath0-body simulation results .",
    "we construct an improved halo bias model of the two - point statistics which reproduces the scale - dependence of the taruya & suto ( 2000 ) bias correcting the mass - dependent but scale - independent bias of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) on linear scales as follows : @xmath9^{0.15 } , \\\\",

    "in order to incorporate the halo exclusion effect approximately , we set @xmath14 for @xmath15 . in the above expressions , @xmath16 is the mass variance smoothed over the top - hat radius @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the mean density , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the linear growth rate of mass fluctuations , and @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] .      in linear theory of gravitational evolution of fluctuations ,",
    "any density fluctuations induce the corresponding peculiar velocity field , which results in the systematic distortion of the pattern of distribution of objects in redshift space ( kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "in addition , virialized nonlinear objects have an isotropic and large velocity dispersion . this _ finger - of - god _ effect",
    "significantly suppresses the observed amplitude of correlation on small scales . with those effects , the nonlinear power spectrum _ in redshift space _",
    "is given as @xmath22^{2 } d_{\\rm vel}[k\\mu\\sigma_{\\rm halo } ] , \\label{nonlinear}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the fourier transform of the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution function ( e.g. , magira et al . 2000 ) , @xmath24 is the direction cosine in @xmath25-space , @xmath26 is the one - dimensional _ pair - wise _ velocity dispersion of halos , and @xmath27 while both @xmath26 and @xmath28 depend on the halo mass @xmath12 , separation @xmath29 , and @xmath13 in reality , we neglect their scale - dependence in computing the redshift distortion , and adopt the halo number - weighted averages : @xmath30 where we adopt the halo mass function @xmath31 fitted by jenkins et al .",
    "the value of @xmath32 , the halo center - of - mass velocity dispersion at @xmath2 , is modeled following yoshida , sheth & diaferio ( 2001 ) .",
    "then our empirical halo bias model can be applied to the two - point correlation function of halos at @xmath13 in redshift space as @xmath33      all cosmological observations are carried out on a light - cone , the null hypersurface of an observer at @xmath2 , and not on any constant - time hypersurface . thus clustering amplitude and shape of objects should naturally evolve even _ within _ the survey volume of a given observational catalogue . unless restricting the objects at a narrow bin of @xmath13 at the expense of the statistical significance , the proper understanding of the data requires a theoretical model to take account of the average over the light cone ( matsubara , suto , & szapudi 1997 ; mataresse et al .",
    "1997 ; moscardini et al .",
    "1998 ; nakamura , matsubara , & suto 1998 ; yamamoto & suto 1999 ; suto et al .",
    "according to the present prescription , the two - point correlation function of halos on the light - cone is computed by averaging over the appropriate halo number density and the comoving volume element between the survey range @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the comoving volume element per unit solid angle . while the above expression assumes a mass - limited sample for simplicity , any observational selection function",
    "can be included in the present model fairly straightforwardly ( hamana , colombi & suto 2001a ) once the the relation between the luminosity of the visible objects and the mass of the hosting dark matter halos is specified .",
    "figure 1 compares our model predictions with the clustering of simulated halos from `` light - cone output '' of the hubble volume @xmath37cdm simulation ( evrard et al .",
    "2001 ) with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for the dark matter correlation functions ,",
    "our model reproduces the simulation data almost perfectly at @xmath43mpc ( see also hamana et al .",
    "this scale corresponds to the mean particle separation of this particular simulation , and thus the current simulation systematically underestimates the real clustering below this scale especially at @xmath44 .",
    "our model and simulation data also show quite good agreement for dark halos at scales larger than @xmath45mpc .",
    "below that scale , they start to deviate slightly in a complicated fashion depending on the mass of halo and the redshift range .",
    "this discrepancy may be ascribed to both the numerical limitations of the current simulations and our rather simplified model for the halo biasing .",
    "nevertheless the clustering of _ clusters _ on scales below @xmath45mpc is difficult to determine observationally anyway , and our model predictions differ from the simulation data only by @xmath46 percent at most . therefore we conclude that in practice our empirical model provides a successful description of halo clustering on the light - cone .",
    "with the successful empirical model of halo clustering , the next natural question is how to apply it in describing _ real _ galaxy clusters . in fact , in my opinion the main obstacle for that purpose is the lack of the universal definition of clusters .",
    "let me give some examples that i can easily think of ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "( i ) press - schechter halos : : :    almost all theoretical studies adopt the definition of dark matter    halos according to the nonlinear spherical model .",
    "this is    characterized by the mean overdensity of @xmath47 ( in the    case of the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the corresponding    expressions in other cosmological models can be also derived . ) .    combining this definition with the press - schechter theory ,",
    "the mass    function of the dark halos can be computed analytically .",
    "this makes it    fairly straightforward to compare the predictions in this model with    observations , and therefore this definition has been widely studied in    cosmology .",
    "( ii ) halos identified from n - body simulations : : :    in reality the gravitationally bound objects in the universe quite    often show significant departure from the spherical symmetry .",
    "such    non - spherical effects can be directly explored with n - body    simulations . even in this methodology , the identification of dark    halos from the simulated particle distribution is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "a most conventional method is the friend - of - friend algorithm . in this    algorithm ,",
    "the linking length is the only adjustable parameter to    controle the resulting halo sample .",
    "its value is usually set to be 0.2    times the mean particle separation in the whole simulation which    _ qualitatively _ corresponds to the overdensity of    @xmath47 as described above .",
    "( iii ) abell clusters : : :    until recently most cosmological studies on galaxy clusters have been    based on the abell catalogue . while this is a really amazing set of    cluster samples ,",
    "the eye - selection criteria applied on the palomar    plates are far from objective and can not be compared with the above    definitions in a quantitative sense .",
    "( iv ) x - ray clusters : : :    the x - ray selection of clusters significantly improves the reliability    of the resulting catalogue due to the increased signal - to - noise and    moreover removes the projection contamination compared with the    optical selection .",
    "nevertheless the quantitative comparison with halos    defined according to ( i ) or ( ii ) requires the knowledge of gas density    profile especially in the central part which fairly dominates the    total x - ray emission .",
    "( v ) sz clusters : : :    the sz cluster survey is especially important in probing the high - z    universe . in this case , however , the signal is more sensitive to the    temperature profile in clusters than the x - ray selection , and thus one    needs additional information / models for temperature in order to    compare with the x - ray / simulation results .",
    "the above consideration raises the importance to examine the systematic comparison among the resulting _",
    "cluster / halo _ samples selected differently . in reality , this is a difficult and time - consuming task , and one might argue that we do not have to worry about such _",
    "details _ at this point .",
    "such an optimistic point of view may turn out to be reasonably right after all .",
    "nevertheless it is still important , at present , to keep in mind that this simplistic assumption of `` dark halos = galaxy clusters '' may produce a systematic effect in the detailed comparison between observational data and theoretical models .",
    "i have presented a phenomenological model for clustering of dark matter halos on the light - cone by combining and improving several existing theoretical models ( hamana et al .",
    "one of the most straightforward and important applications of the current model is to predict and compare the clustering of x - ray selected clusters . in doing so ,",
    "however , the one - to - one correspondence between dark halos and observed clusters should be critically examined at some point .",
    "this assumption is a reasonable working hypothesis , but we need more quantitative justification or modification to move on to _ precision cosmology with clusters_.    i am afraid that this problem has not been considered seriously simply because the agreement between model predictions and available observations seems already _ satisfactory_. in fact , since current viable cosmological models are specified by a set of many _ adjustable",
    "_ parameters , the agreement does not necessarily justify the underlying assumption .",
    "thus it is dangerous to stop doubting the unjustified assumption because of the ( apparent ) success .",
    "i hope to examine these issues in future .",
    "i would like to thank fred lo for inviting me to this exciting and enjoyable meeting and also for great hospitality at taiwan .",
