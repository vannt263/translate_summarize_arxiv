    "thermal fragmentation and assembly of fullerenes can be viewed as reverse processes which have clear features of phase transition .",

    "this work investigates the above idea by means of isothermal molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of fullerenes c@xmath0and c@xmath1 .",
    "we report the occurrence of fullerene sublimation above a critical temperature  the phase transition temperature  beginning with the loss of a c@xmath2 unit .",
    "this rapidly leads to the breaking of the fullerene cage and its eventual decomposition into the gaseous phase . in the region of the phase transition temperature",
    ", the system oscillates between two distinct phases : the _ solid_-like cage and the _ gas_-like state of the carbon dimers .",
    "such oscillation corresponds to the consecutive back - and - forth fragmentation and re - assembly of the fullerene which can be seen clearly in the bimodal distribution of the total energy over time ( at a single temperature ) .",
    "this coexistence behavior , as well as the prominent peak of the temperature - dependent heat capacity are signatures of first - order phase transition in finite systems @xcite .    whether the fragmentation is induced by pyrolysis @xcite , laser - irradiation @xcite or collisions with charged / neutral particles @xcite , fullerenes are known to disintegrate via sequential loss of c@xmath2 units , through asymmetric fission or multifragmentation @xcite .",
    "fullerene stability and its fragmentation mechanism have been investigated extensively by a variety of computational methods , notably tight - binding molecular dynamics ( tbmd ) .",
    "initial tbmd simulations of the c@xmath0fragmentation were performed by wang _",
    "in which the c@xmath0was found to be stable against spontaneous disintegration for temperatures up to 5000  k @xcite .",
    "this was followed by similar studies by zhang _",
    "et al . _ for fullerenes ranging from c@xmath3 to c@xmath4 where ,",
    "for small fullerenes ( n@xmath558 ) it was discovered that the fragmentation temperature increased linearly .",
    "however , for larger fullerenes ( n=60 and n@xmath670 ) , the temperature stabilised around 5500  k @xcite . both studies",
    "employed the tb - parametrisation of xu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , as are the work conducted by lszlo @xcite and openov and podlivaev @xcite for the canonical and microcanonical ensembles respectively .",
    "al _ reported structural changes in the c@xmath0and c@xmath7 in the range of 3000 and 4000  k  with the onset of bond breaking around 5000  k  @xcite .",
    "kim and tomnek conducted fragmentation simulations of the c@xmath3 , c@xmath0and c@xmath1and found several different phases of the fullerene melting process , including a liquid - like pretzel phase @xcite . while xu and scuseria conducted photofragmentation simulations of the c@xmath0and observed sequential loss of c@xmath2 units with cage fragmentation occurring for t@xmath85600  k. horvth and beu have also conducted radiation - induced fragmentation of fullerenes and reported multifragmentation to be the main disintegration channel at high excitation energies .",
    "however , between excitation energies of 100120  ev , they reported the occurrence of a phase transition where they had defined phase transition to be a steep drop in the average fragment size with temperature ( in their work , the average fragment size dropped from 60 to 5 between 100120  ev ) @xcite .",
    "semiempirical bond - order methods are also used in studying fullerenes .",
    "the many - body tersoff potential @xcite has been applied to a large number of carbon systems , and has been used by marcos , _ et al . _ to investigate the thermal stability of fullerenes @xcite .",
    "the reactive bond order potential ( rebo , or brenner s potential ) @xcite  itself built upon the tersoff potential  is also typically employed and has been used to study the formation of carbon - cage structures @xcite and it collision - induced fragmentation @xcite .",
    "fullerenes can be produced by laser - vaporisation of graphite @xcite , or _ en masse _ by thermal methods such as electric - arc discharge @xcite and the combustion of hydrocarbons in a hot oxygen - rich environment @xcite .",
    "they have also been found in candle soot @xcite , chinese ink sticks @xcite , areas of asteroid impact @xcite and as byproducts of carbon nanotube synthesis @xcite . despite the technological leaps in the mass production of fullerenes ,",
    "the detailed atomistic mechanism of fullerene formation has remained elusive and is hampered by the fact that fullerenes are able to self - assemble out of chaotic environments . nonetheless , a variety of proposed mechanisms exist .",
    "prominent amongst them are : _",
    "the pentagon road _ where the fullerene is created by the addition of c@xmath2 units or small carbon particles to the dangling bonds of open graphitic cups @xcite ; _ the fullerene road _ is a similar mechanism to the pentagon road , however the intermediate structures are small closed - cage fullerenes instead @xcite ; _ ring fusion spiral zipper _ where ( instead of c@xmath2 units ) small carbon rings coalesce to form a cluster , and then `` zip '' up and anneal to assemble into a fullerene @xcite and _ the shrinking hot giant fullerene road _ where giant fullerenes ( with attached dangling chains ) are created via heating a gas of dimers at temperatures 20003000  k ( the size - up process ) in a box of side 30   .",
    "these giant fullerenes are then continuously heated , causing shedding of the side chains and evaporation of c@xmath2 units which shrinks the giant fullerenes ( the size - down process ) to sizes as small as the c@xmath0@xcite . using high - resolution tem , huang _ et al . _",
    "have demonstrated the occurrence of this mechanism where they observed the shrinking of a giant fullerene ( c@xmath9 ) inside the cavity of a multi - walled nanotube .",
    "the giant fullerene shrinks to the c@xmath0 , however , below this size , the cage ruptures open and evaporates @xcite . for detailed reviews of the various formation mechanisms , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the phase transition properties of c@xmath0and c@xmath1using molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we have developed an efficient topologically - constrained pairwise forcefield that would allow one to simulate these fragmentation / assembly processes on a long time scale ( 500  ns ) .",
    "the parameters of the forcefield were chosen in order to reproduce the well - known characteristics of the fullerene molecule .",
    "a simple form of the locally pairwise interaction allowed us to achieve significant computational gains to observe the coexistence of two phases during the phase transition process .",
    "the results obtained using the developed forcefield are consistent with those obtained with more advanced potentials , see table .",
    "[ table : fragtemp ] . we observe that in a certain temperature range , the fullerene oscillates between two prominently different phases .",
    "these states can be considered as solid - like ( hollow cage ) and gas - like phases ( gas of dimers ) of the fullerene , and these oscillations correspond to the consecutive fragmentation and reassembly of the fullerene cage at a given temperature .",
    "we analyze the dependence of the heat capacity of the system on temperature using two different approaches : based on a ) energy fluctuations in the system and b ) differentiation of the energy on temperature dependence .",
    "both approaches show that a heat capacity on temperature dependence has a prominent peak which is a signature of a first - order - like phase transition .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ methods ] , we present the developed forcefield and details of the md simulations conducted . in section  [ results ] , we present and discuss results of the simulations , comparing them to previous works ; while in section  [ results : statmech ] , we introduce entropic corrections to our results by means of a statistical mechanics analysis and show the correspondence of this theoretical work to experiments . in section  [ conclusions",
    "] , we outline the conclusions of this work .",
    "the total energy of an @xmath10-particle system is given by the hamiltonian of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the position of atom @xmath13 , @xmath14 its mass and @xmath15 its momentum .",
    "the first term represents the kinetic energy , while the second is the potential energy based on the forcefield @xmath16 .",
    "this forcefield differentiates between two types of interactions in the system : long - range _ van der waals _",
    "( vdw ) and short - range _ covalent _ ( cov ) bonding .",
    "it is expressed as ( for all @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the interatomic distance between atoms @xmath13 and @xmath20 defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the sum in the covalent term is over the three nearest - neighbors of atom @xmath13 : atoms @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; while the sum in the van der waals term is over the other ( @xmath25 ) non - neighbors of atom @xmath13 .",
    "hence , each atom is allocated 3 covalent nearest - neighbors ( determined by their positions relative to atom @xmath13 ) and @xmath25 vdw non - neighbors . in this way",
    ", the atom is _ topologically - constrained _ to interact with a certain type of bonding with certain atoms in the system . in this work , for computational efficiency",
    "we have chosen the lennard - jones type of potential to treat the interactions between the neighboring atoms although , in principle , one could choose different kind of pairwise potentials , such as the morse potential , to model these interactions . @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the equilibrium distance corresponding to the minimum energy @xmath28 .",
    "for the vdw interaction @xmath29 , the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are based on the nonbonded carbon - carbon interaction in @xcite . however , we have adjusted the value of @xmath31 to 3.0   from 4.0   so that we could reproduce correctly the bond length of c@xmath0 .    as for the _ covalent _ interaction , there are two types of bonds in the c@xmath0 : the single and double carbon bonds . hence , we have two different equilibrium parameters : @xmath32 and @xmath33 whose corresponding minimum energy parameters are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 reflect the equilibrium bond lengths of the single and double bonds in the c@xmath0@xcite , while @xmath34 and @xmath35 are based on the carbon - carbon bond dissociation energies in ethane and ethylene respectively @xcite .",
    "hence for the c@xmath0 , @xmath36 since for each atom @xmath13 , there are three neighbors  two of which form the single bond ( also known as the 5 - 6 bond ) , and the other the double bond ( the 6 - 6 bond ) .",
    "the parameters of the forcefield are summarised in table  [ tab : ljparams ] .",
    ".the fullerene forcefield parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to introduce the necessary corrections , let us first analyze the partition of the energy in the system at t=5855  k ( the phase transition temperature ) when it is in the cage and gas states ( see table  [ table : equipartition ] ) .",
    "the difference in the total potential energy when the cage is at t=5855  k and when the system is optimized is equal to 45.8  ev .",
    "this value is equal to @xmath37nkt ( where n=60 is the total number of atoms , k is the boltzmann constant and t=5855  k ) , being in correspondence with the statistical mechanics description of our system .",
    "table  [ table : equipartition ] shows also that the remaining single bonds energy in the gas phase is equal to -68.82  ev .",
    "this energy contribution is due to the continuous formation and fragmentation of unstable short chains , thus the system in our simulation does not remain entirely in a phase of 30 dimers .",
    "however , in the following statistical mechanics description , we assume that the system can reach the gaseous state of 30 entirely unbound c@xmath2 dimers at temperatures close to the phase transition temperature .",
    "one can now calculate the entropy change of the system undergoing a phase transition with both bond numbering and pressure corrections taken into account .",
    "the entropy change of the system experiencing a phase transition can be defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the entropy of the gaseous state and @xmath40 is the entropy of the cage structure of the fullerene . since there are @xmath41 ways to assemble a fullerene from 30 dimers , the term k@xmath42 should be added to the entropy of the cage structure .",
    "the entropy of a dimer being in the gaseous phase is proportional to the logarithm of the volume accessible to it .",
    "therefore the entropy correction to the gaseous state of 30 statistically independent carbon dimers in some arbitrary volume ( for instance , the volume @xmath43 corresponding to experimental conditions ) is equal to k@xmath44=30$]k@xmath45 $ ] or , in terms of concentrations @xmath46k@xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the similar contribution accounting for the entropy of the cage structure within the given volume should be added to @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the total entropy change of the system with the corrections has the following form :    @xmath48-k\\ln\\left[\\frac{n_{sim}}{n_{exp}}\\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is boltzmann constant and @xmath49 is the entropy change of the system experiencing a phase transition from a fullerene cage to the gas state in a simulation box of volume 8000  @xmath50 . here",
    "the energy variation @xmath51 represents the energy difference between the cage structure and the system in the gas phase .",
    "we have assumed that the short chains of carbon dimers fragment almost at the temperature of the phase transition , therefore @xmath52=200.18  ev is the energy difference between the cage state and the state where no single bonds are present .",
    "this value was obtained from molecular dynamics simulations performed at the temperature 5855  k. however , for any arbitrary temperature @xmath52 can be calculated with approximately 5% accuracy as follows : @xmath53kt . the first term in the right hand side of the expression @xmath54  ev is the total energy of single bonds for the equilibrated structure ( see table  [ tab : ljparams ] ) and the second term is the potential part of the vibrational energy of the dimers within the cage .",
    "the term @xmath55kt@xmath56 is the contribution to @xmath57 which arises due to the presence of pressure in the system .",
    "this term accounts for the energy needed to overcome the external pressure in the system during the process of fullerene fragmentation .",
    "k is the phase transition temperature obtained from the simulations while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the concentrations of carbon dimers in the simulation and at experimental conditions respectively . the second term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ indistinguishable ] ) accounts for the permutation correction of the entropy in the cage state as discussed above .",
    "the third term represents the entropy change of the gas of 30 carbon dimers with variation of the system volume from @xmath61 to @xmath43 , while the fourth term is a similar variation but for the gas of fullerene molecules instead .",
    "we have assumed that , in the gas phase , the dimers are statistically independent .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ indistinguishable ] ) can be rewritten as :    @xmath62,\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 is the pressure in the system .",
    "here @xmath64 , where @xmath65=8000  @xmath50 is the volume of the simulation box and @xmath66 is the excluded volume due to the van der waals repulsion between the atoms .",
    "the excluded volume is estimated through the distance at which the repulsion energy between dimers is equal to kt .",
    "this distance @xmath67 is calculated as a root of the following equation :    @xmath68=kt,\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 and @xmath27 are the parameters of the forcefield given in table  [ tab : ljparams ] .",
    "knowing the dependence of r on temperature and the fact that each pair of atom are not allowed to be closer than the distance r , one can calculate the excluded volume : @xmath69 , which at t=5855  k , is equal to @xmath66=822  @xmath50 .",
    "knowing @xmath70 as a function of pressure , one can then evaluate the phase transition temperature as a root of the following expression : @xmath71    where @xmath54  ev is the total energy of the single bonds for the equilibrated structure ( see table  [ tab : ljparams ] ) , while the second term in the nominator is the potential part of vibrational energy of the dimers in the cage .",
    "these two terms describe the energy difference between the cage and the gaseous state of the fullerene at the phase transition temperature .",
    "the third term @xmath72kt accounts for the energy necessary for increasing the volume of the system during the fragmentation process .",
    "the dependence of the phase transition temperature on pressure is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] .    phase transition temperature on pressure in the gas phase is plotted by solid line .",

    "[ fig : pressure ] , it is seen that for the pressure range of @xmath78  kpa the phase transition temperature is between 38004200  k , being in a good agreement with the temperatures reported in the arc discharge experiments @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that our statistical mechanics model is developed for for an thermodynamically equilibrated system .",
    "however , in electric arc discharge experiments the condition of local thermal equilibrium for the arc region can be justified due to high current density ( @xmath79320 a/@xmath80 ) and high pressures ( 4070  kpa ) @xcite .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] shows that with lowering the pressure , the phase transition temperature decreases .",
    "however , at these conditions , the equilibration time increases exponentially with the decrease of the phase transition temperature and at some point it should exceed the available experimental time limits .      as a function of temperature compared to that for c@xmath0 .",

    ", we have included the snapshots of the c@xmath1fragmentation process in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapc240 ] . similar to the c@xmath0",
    ", the c@xmath1also undergoes deformation of the cage which eventually leads to the evaporation of a dimer as the first step towards complete disintegration . however , we observe that the c@xmath1is more readily to form larger fragments , chains and rings and , unlike the c@xmath0 , it does not reach the coexistence regime at the the phase transition temperature .",
    "this regime for c@xmath1is expected to happen at a longer simulation times .",
    "as before , we have derived the heat capacity for the c@xmath1 , see inset to fig .

    "we have demonstrated from our simulations , the fragmentation process of the fullerene using our constructed forcefield .",
    "our simulation does not show _",
    "liquid_-like phases of the fullerene and the phase transition is seen to occur between the _ solid_-like and _ gas_-like phases .",
    "the solid - to - liquid transition are not thermally stable and will fragment into a gas - like phase if the simulation is run long enough @xcite .",
    "most studies in this area have been performed with md simulations that are between 10 ps to 1 ns , although it is known experimentally that both laser - induced and thermal fragmentation of fullerenes occur on the @xmath81s timescale @xcite . this therefore implies that since the time scale of any simulation is much shorter than the scale of the experiments , the md fragmentation temperatures will therefore overestimate the experimental ones .",
    "however , longer simulation time should allow one to observe phases that are stable in the fullerene fragmentation process , and in this field , our simulations are two orders of magnitude longer than other md simulations performed .",
    "nonetheless , one must also take into account that in our model , the carbon atoms are unable to form bonds with atoms that have not been designated as its neighbors , and this might affect both the observation a liquid - like phase and the energetics of the fragmentation process .",
    "however , our result of a phase transition occurring at t=38004200  k and requiring an energy of 130140  ev is in good agreement with previous work in this field @xcite .",
    "we have also shown a novel coexistence behavior of the c@xmath0 in the phase transition region and have observed the reassembly process of the fullerene cage from a gas of carbon dimers .",
    "we have conducted constant - temperature molecular dynamics simulations of c@xmath0and c@xmath1 . without pressure and entropy corrections , our simulations demonstrate that both c@xmath0and c@xmath1undergo a phase transition to a _ gas_-like state at 5855  k and 5500  k respectively . for the c@xmath0we report a two - phase coexistence behavior where the fullerene continuously oscillates between a _",

    "such oscillation corresponds to continuous fragmentation and reassembly of the fullerene cage ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : snapc60 ] and  [ fig : coex ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the process of fullerene fragmentation and reassembly is a first - order - like phase transition between gaseous and cage states in the finite system .",
    "the developed topologically - constrained forcefield allowed for simulations that are 500  ns long , more than two orders of magnitude longer than those conducted in previous works and the results using this forcefield correlate well with those from more sophisticated models ( see table  [ table : fragtemp ] ) . using statistical mechanics arguments",
    ", we have shown that in the absence of bond - numbering and taking into account pressure corrections to correspond to experimental conditions , the phase transition temperature of c@xmath0would be found in the range of 38004200  k ( corresponding to pressures between 10100  kpa ) .",
