    "in this paper we shall study the special point in the phase diagram of a semi - infinite system . for reviews on surface critical phenomena",
    "let us briefly recall the basic features of this phase diagram at the example of the spin-1/2 ising model on the simple cubic lattice and a semi - infinite geometry .",
    "it s reduced hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote sites of the lattice , @xmath5 is a pair of nearest neighbors and @xmath6 is the surface of the system .",
    "the spin @xmath7 at the site @xmath3 can take either the value @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the boltzmann factor is given by @xmath10 , since the reduced hamiltonian incorporates the temperature .",
    "we define @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the coupling constant in the bulk , @xmath14 the excess coupling constant at the surface and @xmath15 is the temperature .",
    "below we shall refer to @xmath16 and @xmath17 as the coupling in the bulk and the excess coupling at the surface , respectively .",
    "below we shall consider vanishing external fields @xmath18 in the bulk as well as at the surface .    in figure [ diagram ]",
    "we have sketched the phase diagram of this system .",
    "sketch of the phase diagram of the semi - infinite system . on the @xmath3-axis we plot the coupling @xmath16 of the bulk and on the @xmath4-axis the excess coupling @xmath17 of the surface .",
    "the phase , where both the boundary spins and those of the bulk are disordered is labelled by a , while the one with disordered bulk and and ordered surface is labelled by b. the phase , where the bulk and the surface are ordered is labelled by c. the line of surface transitions is labelled by s , the line of ordinary transitions by o and the line of extraordinary transitions by e. these three lines meet in the so called special or surface - bulk point that we have labelled by sp .",
    "a discussion is given in the text.,width=502 ]    for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the critical coupling of the bulk system , the spins in the bulk are ordered . as a consequence , also the spins at the surface are ordered . at @xmath21 the spins at the surface decouple completely from those of the bulk .",
    "hence a two dimensional ising model remains that undergoes a phase transition at @xmath22 .",
    "starting from the point @xmath23 there is the line of surface transitions , where the spins at the surface order , while those of the bulk remain disordered .",
    "this line hits the line @xmath24 in the so called special or surface - bulk point , which is a tri - critical point .",
    "the transitions from disordered surface and disordered bulk to ordered bulk and ordered surface are called ordinary transitions , while those from disordered bulk and ordered surface to ordered bulk and ordered surface are called extraordinary transitions .",
    "surface critical phenomena had been studied first by using the mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "the application of field theoretic methods to surface critical phenomena is complicated by the fact that translational invariance is broken by the surface . as a consequence , surface critical exponents are only computed up to @xmath25 in the @xmath26-expansion @xcite .",
    "furthermore surface critical phenomena have been studied by using high temperature series expansions , real space renormalization group methods and monte carlo simulations of lattice models .",
    "the special point is characterized by the two relevant bulk renormalization group ( rg)-exponents @xmath27 and @xmath28 and the two relevant surface rg - exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "similar to the pure bulk case , these rg - exponents can be related to a number of surface critical exponents that characterize the behavior of thermodynamic quantities related to the surface in the neighborhood of the special point @xcite .    in the present work we locate the special point of three different lattice models and determine the rg - exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 by using finite size scaling ( fss ) @xcite methods . in the presence of a surface , typically corrections @xmath31",
    "appear @xcite , where @xmath32 is the linear extent of the finite system .",
    "analysing numerical data , it is difficult to disentangle these corrections from leading bulk corrections which are @xmath33 , where @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the ising model we simulate the blume - capel model that is a generalization of the ising model .",
    "in addition to @xmath8 and @xmath9 the spin can take the value @xmath35 .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 of the blume - capel model controls the density of spins with @xmath37 .",
    "it has been shown that for a particular value @xmath38 of the parameter @xmath36 the amplitude of leading corrections to scaling vanishes .",
    "see @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "the precise definition of the model is given below in section [ definemodel ] .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : first we define the models that we simulate .",
    "we summarize results for the critical coupling and the critical exponents of the bulk system .",
    "we define the quantities that we have measured and discuss their finite size scaling behavior .",
    "the scaling behavior is affected by corrections , which have to be taken into account when analysing monte carlo data .",
    "then we report our numerical results : first we have simulated three different models on @xmath39 lattices , where @xmath32 is the linear extend of the lattice . based on these simulations",
    "we determine @xmath40 for these models and obtain estimates of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "next we study the surface transition in the neighborhood of the special point .",
    "then we discuss the magnetisation profile of films with special boundary conditions at one surface and fixed boundary conditions at the other .",
    "finally we summarize and compare our results for the rg - exponents with those obtained by field theoretic methods and previous simulations of the spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "the blume - capel model on the simple cubic lattice is characterized by the reduced hamiltonian @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes a site of the lattice .",
    "the components @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 take integer values in the range @xmath46 .",
    "the spin @xmath7 might take the values @xmath8 , @xmath35 or @xmath9 . in the following",
    "we shall consider a vanishing external field @xmath47 throughout .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 controls the density of vacancies @xmath37 . in the limit @xmath48",
    ", these vacancies are completely suppressed , and hence the spin-1/2 ising model is recovered . for @xmath49",
    "the model undergoes a second order phase transition in the three - dimensional ising universality class . for @xmath50",
    "the transition is of first order .",
    "the most recent estimate for the tri - critical point is @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "numerically , using monte carlo simulations it has been shown that there is a point @xmath52 on the line of second order phase transitions , where the amplitude of leading corrections to scaling vanishes .",
    "our most recent estimate is @xmath53 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have simulated the model at @xmath54 close to @xmath20 on lattices of a linear size up to @xmath55 . from a standard finite size scaling analysis of renormalization group invariant quantities such as the binder cumulant we found @xmath56 for the critical coupling of the bulk at @xmath54 .",
    "recent estimates for the critical coupling of the bulk of the spin-1/2 ising model are @xmath57 , table x of @xcite and @xmath58 @xcite . in the following we assume @xmath59 .",
    "the amplitude of leading corrections to scaling at @xmath54 is at least by a factor of @xmath60 smaller than for the spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "our recent estimates for bulk critical exponents in the three - dimensional ising universality class are @xcite @xmath61      in monte carlo simulations we are restricted to finite lattices .",
    "therefore a surface requires a counterpart .",
    "this means that we actually study systems with a film geometry . in the ideal case",
    ", film geometry means that the system has a finite thickness @xmath62 , while in the other two directions the thermodynamic limit @xmath63 is taken . in order to approximate this limit in monte carlo simulations ,",
    "one usually chooses @xmath64 and applies periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath9 and @xmath65 directions .",
    "note that we shall simulate lattices with @xmath66 throughout .",
    "as we shall see below , in order to compute surface critical exponents , the condition @xmath64 is not mandatory .",
    "our estimates for the surface critical exponents are actually obtained from simulations of lattices with @xmath67 .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian of the blume - capel model with film geometry is @xmath68 where we have put the surfaces at @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in our convention @xmath5 runs over all pairs of nearest neighbor sites with fluctuating spins .",
    "note that here the sites @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not nearest neighbors as it would be the case for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for each bulk term there is a corresponding surface enhancement term . in our simulations and the analysis of the data we have used the surface couplings @xmath73 as parameters instead of the excess surface couplings @xmath17 and @xmath74 .",
    "note that as long as the bulk transition and the line of surface transitions remain continuous , the qualitative features of the phase diagram that we have discussed in the introduction should remain unchanged .",
    "since the values of @xmath36 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 that we shall consider are much smaller than @xmath77 @xcite and @xmath78 @xcite of the two - dimensional blume - capel model on the square lattice , this should be the case in our study .",
    "renormalization group invariant quantities are very useful to locate critical or multicritical points .",
    "we study the binder cumulant @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "the second moment correlation length is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the fourier transform of the correlation function at the lowest non - zero momentum in 1 or 2 direction and @xmath83 is the magnetic susceptibility . since in our simulations @xmath84 , the expectation value of @xmath85 is identical for the 1 and the 2 direction . in order to reduce the statistical error ,",
    "we have measured @xmath85 for both directions and have averaged the results .",
    "the ratio @xmath86 is renormalization group invariant .",
    "the third renormalization group invariant quantity that we consider is the ratio @xmath87 of partition functions , where @xmath88 is the partition function of a system with anti - periodic boundary conditions in 1 direction and periodic ones in 2 direction or vice versa , while in the case of @xmath89 periodic boundary conditions are imposed in 1 and 2 direction . also here , since @xmath84 in our simulations , we determine @xmath87 for both choices and average the results .",
    "the ratio @xmath87 of partition functions can be efficiently evaluated using the boundary flip algorithm @xcite .",
    "here we use a modified version of the boundary flip algorithm as discussed in appendix a 2 of ref . @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall refer to the renormalization group invariant quantities @xmath90 , @xmath87 and @xmath86 using the symbol @xmath91 .",
    "for vanishing symmetry breaking fields @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , a renormalization group invariant quantity behaves as @xmath95^{y_t},t_1 [ l_0/\\xi_{1,0}]^{y_{t_1 } } )   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the amplitude of the correlation length in the high temperature phase and the normalisation factor @xmath99 is still undetermined . in section  ( [ mc1 ] )",
    "we have fixed the ratio @xmath100 and have set the bulk coupling to its critical value : @xmath101 .",
    "this allows us to determine the location of the special point @xmath40 by using the standard crossing method , where @xmath91 is considered as function of @xmath17 .",
    "the behavior of the slope of the renormalization group invariant quantities allows us to determine the surface rg - exponent @xmath29 : taking the derivative with respect to @xmath17 we get @xmath102^{y_t},t_1 [ l_0/\\xi_{1,0}]^{y_{t_1 } } ) \\ ;        [ l_0/\\xi_{1,0}]^{y_{t_1}}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is minus the partial derivative of @xmath104 with respect to its third argument .",
    "finally we define the surface susceptibilities for a vanishing surface magnetisation @xmath105 : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 where @xmath109 the finite size scaling behavior of these quantities can be inferred from the singular part of the reduced free energy per area of the film .",

    "( [ rscaling],[slopescaling],[chiscaling1],[chiscaling2 ] ) are affected by corrections .",
    "these are caused by irrelevant scaling fields , the analytic background in the reduced free energy per area and the fact that e.g. in eq .",
    "( [ rscaling ] ) the arguments of the scaling function @xmath104 should be actually analytic functions of @xmath120 and @xmath121 that we have linearized here .",
    "the leading bulk correction is @xmath122 , where our most recent estimate @xmath34 obtained from monte carlo simulations of the blume - capel and the ising model @xcite is slightly larger than that obtained from field theoretical methods , e.g. @xmath123 by using perturbation theory in three dimensions fixed and @xmath124 by using the @xmath26-expansion @xcite .",
    "there are also corrections @xmath125 , where @xmath126 . in the case of improved models these",
    "are highly suppressed and therefore we shall ignore them in the analysis of our data below . following @xcite subleading corrections",
    "are characterized by @xmath127 .",
    "there is no reason to assume that the amplitude of the subleading correction vanishes in the case of the improved blume - capel model .",
    "likely it is of similar size as in the spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "furthermore there are well established corrections with @xmath128 , for example related to the breaking of the spatial rotational invariance by the simple cubic lattice @xcite .    in the presence of surfaces",
    "there are also corrections caused by irrelevant surface fields .",
    "one expects that the leading ones are @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "in general we expect that for finite @xmath62 finite size scaling laws such as eqs .",

    "fitting data obtained from monte carlo simulations , only a very limited number of terms can be taken into account .",
    "this unavoidable truncation of the wegner - expansion leads to a systematic error of the estimate of e.g. the exponent @xmath3 that is often larger than the statistical one .    in the present work",
    ", we shall use ansaetze that include either no correction , a correction @xmath131 or corrections @xmath131 and @xmath132 . in the case of the surface susceptibilities",
    "we shall also take into account a term for the analytic background .",
    "the systematic errors of our results are then estimated from the variation of the results obtained by using these different ansaetze .",
    "in this part of our study we consider three different models . in all cases we chose @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath93 and @xmath119 .",
    "we have simulated the blume - capel model at @xmath54 with two different choices of @xmath135 : the choice @xmath136 is called bc1 model and @xmath137 is called bc2 model in the following .",
    "note that in the case of the bc2 model , the spins at the surfaces can take only the values @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , we have simulated the spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "we have simulated at the best estimates of the bulk critical point ; i.e. @xmath138 for the blume capel model at @xmath54 and @xmath139 for the spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "the numerical uncertainty of these numbers is negligible in the present study .    for each measurement of the observables we performed the following sequence of monte",
    "carlo updates : first one sweep with a local update . in the case of the ising model",
    "we use a local metropolis and for the blume - capel model a local heat - bath update .",
    "one sweep means that we run through the lattice once in type - writer fashion .",
    "then we performed a certain number of single - cluster updates @xcite followed by two wall - cluster updates @xcite ; one for each of the directions with periodic boundary conditions . in all our simulations",
    "we have used the mersenne twister algorithm @xcite as pseudo - random number generator .    in the case of the blume - capel models bc1 and bc2 , no previous estimate of the surface coupling @xmath140 was available .",
    "therefore , we have successively improved our estimate of @xmath140 with increasing lattice size @xmath32 . in order to obtain the observables as a function of @xmath141 in the neighborhood of the simulation point ,",
    "we have computed the coefficients of the taylor - expansion of the observables in @xmath141 around the simulation point up to third order . in table",

    "these estimates can be used in future studies of thin films . in particular , we intend to study the thermodynamic casimir force in thin films in the neighborhood of the special point .",
    "furthermore we have studied the behavior of the surface transition in the neighborhood of the special point .",
    "our numerical results follow the theoretical expectations .",
    "however the special point can not be located accurately with such an approach .",
    "finally we have simulated a film with symmetry breaking boundary conditions at one surface and special boundary conditions at the other .",
    "the behavior of the magnetisation at the surface with special boundary conditions follows a power law .",
    "its exponent can be expressed in terms of the rg - exponent @xmath30 .",
    "the analysis of the data fully confirms our estimate of @xmath30 given in table [ expospecial ] .",
    "the magnetisation profile follows a universal function .",
    "this theoretical expectation is fully confirmed by the nice collapse of data that we observe for a large range of thicknesses @xmath62 of the film .",
    "an interesting feature of the magnetisation profile is that at the surface with special boundary conditions , which do not break the symmetry , the magnetisation is decreasing with increasing distance from the surface .",
