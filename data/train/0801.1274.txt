    "the wilson loop operator @xcite is a gauge - invariant observable of fundamental importance in yang - mills gauge theories @xcite .",
    "it is defined from the holonomy of the gauge connection around a given loop .",
    "especially , it is well - known that the area law of the wilson loop average in yang - mills theory gives a criterion for quark confinement .    in the first half of this paper",
    ", we give a pedagogic and thorough derivation of a non - abelian stokes theorem for the wilson loop operator of su(n ) yang - mills gauge connection . the non - abelian stokes theorem ( nast )",
    "means that the non - abelian wilson loop operator defined for a closed loop @xmath5 is rewritten into a surface integral form over any surface bounding the loop @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we restrict our considerations to the diakonov - petrov ( dp ) type @xcite among various types of nast .",
    "the dp version of nast was originally derived in @xcite for su(2 ) case and later developed and extended to su(n ) case in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is because the dp type can give us a very useful tool for understanding quark confinement based on the dual superconductor picture @xcite which is a promising scenario of quark confinement .    in the latter half of this paper ,",
    "some physical aspects obtained form the nast will be demonstrated .",
    "the following are the main results of this paper obtained by extending the previous works @xcite for su(n ) yang - mills gauge connection , although some of them have been known for the su(2 ) case as will be mentioned in the relevant parts .",
    "we put our emphasis on the physical aspects rather than the mathematical rigor .",
    "\\1 ) the dp version of nast includes no ordering procedures , which enables one to obtain an abelian - like expression for the non - abelian wilson loop operator .",
    "it is derived as a path - integral representation of the wilson loop operator by using the coherent state for semi - simple lie groups .",
    "the dp version of nast is quite useful to consider the dual superconductivity as the electric - magnetic dual of ordinary superconductivity described by the maxwell - like abelian gauge theory .",
    "see section  [ sec : nast ] .",
    "\\2 ) the contribution to the wilson loop average is separated into two parts originating from the decomposition of the yang - mills potential @xmath6 : @xmath7 in such a way that only the @xmath8 part is responsible for quark confinement and that the remaining @xmath9 part decouples .",
    "this is an gauge invariant understanding of the phenomenon which was known so far as the infrared abelian dominance @xcite in yang - mills theory under a specific gauge fixing called the maximal abelian gauge @xcite . in other words , this give a gauge - invariant `` abelian '' projection and `` abelian dominance '' for the wilson loop .",
    "in fact , the 100% abelian dominance for the wilson loop is a direct consequence derived in the gauge - invariant way from this construction @xcite , although it was confirmed by numerical simulations on a lattice under the maximal abelian gauge @xcite .",
    "see section  [ sec : nastr ] .",
    "\\3 ) the wilson loop operator is explicitly rewritten in terms of conserved currents originating from the magnetic monopole which can be derived in the gauge - invariant way from the pure su(n ) yang  mills theory even in the absence of higgs scalar field @xcite , in sharp contrast to the t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole in georgi - glashow gauge - higgs model .",
    "this implies that the wilson loop operator can be a probe for magnetic monopole whose condensation will cause the dual superconductivity in yang - mills theory .",
    "see section  [ sec : magnetic - monopole ] .",
    "\\4 ) the quark confinement in the sense of area law of the wilson loop average , if realized , can be caused by a _",
    "( _ non - abelian _ u(@xmath10 ) ) magnetic monopole @xcite irrespective of @xmath1 in su(@xmath1 ) yang - mills theory for @xmath11 , against the conventional wisdom that @xmath10 magnetic monopoles associated with the maximal torus subgroup @xmath12 are responsible for quark confinement .",
    "this was conjectured in @xcite .",
    "see section  [ sec : su3 ] .",
    "\\5 ) the quantization condition for the magnetic charge of the single magnetic monopole is derived from the fact that the non - abelian stokes theorem should not depend on the surface used to represent the surface integral .",
    "the quantization condition is the same as the dirac type for su(2 ) , while it is similar to the dirac type , but is different to that for @xmath13 .",
    "see section  [ sec : magnetic - charge ] .",
    "\\6 ) the wilson loop operator has a geometrical and topological meaning related to solid angle seen at the location of the magnetic monopole in three - dimensional case , and the winding number between the magnetic monopole loop and the surface in four - dimensional case .",
    "this leads to a possibility that the area law can be derived by calculating the geometrical configurations of the relevant topological objects .",
    "see section  [ sec : magnetic - monopole ] .",
