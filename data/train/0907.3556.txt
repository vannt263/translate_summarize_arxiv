    "vacancies are predominant point defects in metals and they could have profound influence on materials properties , ranging from mechanical strength @xcite , deformation behavior @xcite , kinetic transport and diffusion @xcite , to electrical conductivity and heat capacity@xcite , to name a few .",
    "thus the study of vacancy effects on properties of technologically important materials , such as cu , is of great interest .",
    "for all these properties , stress plays crucial roles .",
    "for example , it is generally believed that hydrostatic tensile stress is the driving force for the stress - void nucleation @xcite and stress gradients are responsible for the void growth @xcite .",
    "the present work touches upon the stress induced voiding , which is one of the most important factors that cause failures of ultra - large integrated circuits with cu - based interconnects @xcite . in this case , the stress is built up as a result of the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between the metal lines and the surrounding dielectrics @xcite .",
    "there are other interesting problems related to the void growth and coalescence under various loading conditions @xcite .",
    "for example , experimentally tem observations have been performed for neutron - irradiated cu at @xmath0c which verify the transition from stacking fault tetrahedra ( sft ) to voids , depending on the size of the vacancy cluster .",
    "these observations are consistent to the embedded - atom - method ( eam ) simulations @xcite . a direct transition from a 20-vacancy cluster to an sft",
    "was also found by using parallel replica eam molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "we have recently studied void formation by using multiscale method and discovered a connection between vacancy - induced bonding cage and the tendency of void formation in fcc metals @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will use atomistic simulations based on eam potential to ( 1 ) determine the structure of the most stable @xmath1-vacancy clusters where @xmath2 ; ( 2 ) examine the mechanical stability of cu containing vacancy clusters ; ( 3 ) study the dependence of vacancy - cluster formation energy and binding energy as a function of uniaxial and volumetric tensile stress ; ( 4 ) examine the thermal stability of the vacancy - clusters at different temperatures . the computational method is given in sec ii .",
    "the convergence of vacancy formation energy is studied in sec iii(a ) ; the structure of vacancy clusters is determined in sec iii(b ) and the mechanical stability of the vacancy clusters is examined in sec .",
    "iii(c ) for both uniaxial and volumetric tensile strains .",
    "finally the thermal stability of the vacancy clusters is considered in iii(d ) and the conclusion is in sec iv .",
    "a cubic supercell with periodic boundary conditions along three directions is used in the simulations .",
    "the supercell is oriented in cubic directions , i.e. , @xmath3 in @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 in @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 in @xmath8 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the atomic interaction is described by ercolessi - adams eam potential@xcite , which has been widely used for the metallic systems , such as cu @xcite .",
    "the atomic relaxation is carried out with molecular statics implemented in the lammps codes@xcite .",
    "it is well established that the eam potential is capable to provide reasonable atomic structure and energetics for vacancies in cu@xcite .",
    "the vacancy cluster formation energy , which describes the energy cost for forming a vacancy cluster with respect to the perfect lattice , is computed for various vacancy clusters , in the presence or absence of external strains .",
    "specifically , under a strain @xmath9 the vacancy cluster formation energy , @xmath10 of a given @xmath1-vacancy cluster in an @xmath11-atom supercell is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total energy of the supercell containing ( @xmath14 ) atoms with an @xmath1-vacancy cluster under strain @xmath9 and @xmath15 is the total energy of the supercell containing @xmath11 atoms in a perfect lattice with a strain of @xmath9 .",
    "it is convenient to use the formation energy per vacancy @xmath16 to compare among different vacancy clusters , which is defined as @xmath17 another important quantity calculated is the vacancy binding energy , @xmath18 , which describes the energy gain when @xmath1 monovacancies are combined into an @xmath1-vacancy cluster .",
    "the binding energy of an @xmath1-vacancy cluster under a strain @xmath9 is given by @xmath19 a positive value of @xmath18 suggests that it is energetically favorable for the @xmath1 monovacancies to form an @xmath1-vacancy cluster at zero temperature under the strain .",
    "similarly , one can define the binding energy per vacancy , @xmath20 , to facilitate the comparison among different vacancy clusters , which is given by @xmath21    in order to determine the thermodynamic stability of a vacancy cluster , we need to calculate dynamical matrix and free energy of the defect system . under the harmonic approximation ,",
    "the dynamical matrix under strain @xmath9 is defined as following @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the atoms , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the displacement of atom @xmath26 and @xmath27 in direction @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively from its relaxed equilibrium position .",
    "@xmath30 is the total energy of the system .",
    "the vacancy formation entropy is evaluated via the equation @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 represents the harmonic vibrational frequency for the system with and without vacancies , respectively .",
    "three acoustic phonon frequencies are removed from the sum owing to the translational invariance of the system .",
    "analogous to the definition of the binding energy , the binding entropy is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the formation entropy of a monovacancy and an @xmath1-vacancy cluster , respectively .",
    "the dynamical matrix is determined by displacing the atoms @xmath37 from their relaxed equilibrium positions in all three cartesian directions .",
    "@xcite the dynamical matrix is then diagonalized and the eigen - frequencies are obtained to evaluate the formation entropy .",
    "the gibbs binding free energy of an @xmath1-vacancy cluster at temperature @xmath38 is determined as @xmath39 the positive ( negative ) value of @xmath40 indicates the @xmath1-vacancy cluster is thermodynamically stable ( unstable ) against a simultaneous dissociation into @xmath1 monovacancies .",
    "a convergence test is carried out to determine the sufficient system size , and results are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : e1f ] ) . for a monovacancy",
    ", we find 6@xmath41 ( @xmath42",
    " ) is enough to reach convergency for the vacancy formation energy , while for @xmath43-vacancy cluster ( the largest vacancy cluster in this study ) , 20@xmath41 appears to be sufficient .",
    "therefore , in all our calculations , we use 20@xmath41 as the system size . with a supercell of @xmath44 ( 32000 lattice sites ) , we found that the monovacancy formation energy is 1.2837 ev , which agrees very well with previous calculation and experiment@xcite .",
    "the vacancy clusters containing up to twenty - one vacancies are studied in this work . for each @xmath1-vacancy cluster ,",
    "several most stable configurations are considered , especially in planar , tetrahedral , and spherical structures .",
    "these structures are emphasized owing to their relevance to vacancy loops , stacking fault tetrahedra and spherical voids , observed in experiments@xcite . for each @xmath1 , the structure with the maximum binding energy",
    "is regarded as the most energetically stable configuration for the @xmath1-vacancy cluster .",
    "the most stable di - vacancy is the one that the two vacancies are the nearest neighbors .",
    "the binding energy is 0.158 ev , agreeing well with the previous calculation and experiment@xcite .",
    "starting from the most stable di - vacancy , we can search for the most stable tri - vacancy by placing the third vacancy at various nearest - neighbor position .",
    "the configuration of the highest binding energy of a tri - vacancy is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and @xmath45 ev .",
    "the three vacancies form an equilateral triangle lying on \\{111 } plane , and are mutually nearest - neighbors . starting from the most stable tri - vacancy , we considered six most probable configurations for a four - vacancy cluster , and found that the equilateral tetrahedron formed by four nearest - neighbor vacancies has the highest binding energy of @xmath46 ev .",
    "the atomic structure of the tetra - vacancy is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) .    in the same manner , we explored the most stable atomic configurations for all vacancy clusters with @xmath47 .",
    "for example , we found the most stable 5-vacancy cluster ( penta - vacancy ) is a squared pyramid with a binding energy of @xmath48 ev , shown in fig .",
    "the most stable 6-vacancy cluster ( hexa - vacancy ) is an octahedron shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) with a binding energy of @xmath49 ev .",
    "interestingly , we found that the most stable configuration of a 10-vacancy cluster is not an equilateral tetrahedron shown in fig .",
    "2(e ) , but rather a less symmetric structure shown in fig .",
    "for @xmath50 , the most stable structure resembles a sphere , with one vacancy at the center , and 12 nearest neighbors surrounding it .",
    "the radius of the sphere is @xmath51 shown in fig .",
    "2(g ) . for @xmath52",
    ", the vacancy clusters tend to form 3-dimensional voids , appearing more like spheres than tetrahedra .",
    "for example , the structure of a 19-vacancy cluster is shown in fig .",
    "2(h ) ; it has one vacancy at center , and 12 nearest neighbors and 6 second - nearest neighbors of the central vacancy filling the sphere of a radius of @xmath41 .",
    "the formation energy per vacancy @xmath53 for all vacancy clusters is presented in fig .",
    "overall , the formation energy decreases with respect to the cluster size , which can be understood from the liquid - drop model for metals @xcite . in this model",
    ", the void formation energy can be approximated as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the wigner - seitz radius of the void with volume @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the surface energy density , and @xmath58 is the curvature energy @xcite . the volume of an @xmath1-vacancy cluster can be approximated as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the volume of a monovacancy .",
    "therefor the eq .",
    "( [ eq : liquid ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "taking @xmath64 ev / @xmath65 , @xmath58 = 0.119 @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , the eq .",
    "( 10 ) is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : bindinga ] ) , which matches very well the atomistic results .",
    "the value of @xmath57 and @xmath58 is taken from reference @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 is close to the eam surface energy density of cu : 0.08 ev / @xmath65 for ( 110 ) surface and 0.114 ev / @xmath65 for ( 111 ) surface .",
    "interestingly , we find that the formation energy curve becomes flatter as @xmath1 becomes larger , and approaches an asymptotic value of   0.7 ev .",
    "this value is very close to the monovacancy formation energy on a flat ( 111 ) surface of cu , which is 0.73 ev .",
    "the reason for this asymptotic behavior is that as the vacancy cluster becomes larger , the curvature of the void surface becomes smaller , and thus the formation energy approaches the value of a monovacancy on a flat surface .",
    "we also present the binding energy per vacancy as a function of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "3 , shown in diamond curve and scaled to the right axis .",
    "the binding energy increases monotonically with @xmath1 , and is positive for all vacancy clusters , suggesting that the monovacancies prefer to aggregate in cu , in order to reduce the number of broken bonds . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : liqidn ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ebinding2e ] ) , we can express @xmath68 as @xmath69 which is plotted as the dashed line in fig .",

    "it appears that the liquid - drop model reproduces the atomistic results surprisingly well .",
    "-vacancy clusters .",
    "the dot - dashed line and dashed line are the prediction of @xmath70 and @xmath68 from the liquid - drop model respectively . ]      in this section , we examine the mechanical stability of the vacancy clusters by applying external uniaxial tensile strain and volumetric tensile strain to the system .",
    "the strain - free structures of the vacancy clusters are taken from the results obtained in sec .",
    "b.      the uniaxial tensile strain is applied along the @xmath5 axis , and the @xmath3 and @xmath7 axes are free to change by conserving the volume .",
    "the strain is applied quasi - statically , with each loading that is 1.001 times that of the previous step .",
    "we examine the mechanical response of the vacancy clusters by showing the strain energy and tensile stress @xmath71 as a function of applied strain @xmath72 .",
    "because the results of all vacancy clusters follow the same pattern , we select the @xmath73-vacancy cluster as a representative to illustrate the salient features of the results . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , we find that both strain energy and the tensile stress increase monotonically with strain initially , followed by a sudden drop at the yield point .",
    "the system behaves in a linear elastic fashion , i.e. , the energy increases quadratically and the stress increases linearly .",
    "there are two importance results : ( 1 ) the perfect and the defect lattice have almost identical elastic behavior - the two curves coincide with each other for both energy and stress .",
    "( 2 ) the presence of the vacancy defect significantly reduces the yield strength of the material .",
    "the yield stress and strain are 7.32 gpa and 0.117 for the prefect lattice , and 4.98 gpa and 0.085 for the defect system , respectively . at the yield point",

    "5 . csp is defined as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the vectors or bonds corresponding to the six pairs of opposite nearest neighbors in the deformed fcc lattice @xcite , and @xmath77 is the nearest neighbor distance in the perfect fcc lattice . for each atom",
    ", there is a csp value associated with it .",
    "dislocation core and stacking fault correspond to the csp values ranging between 0.003 and 0.1 . just before the yielding",
    ", there is no dislocation in the system ( fig .",
    "5a ) while just after the yielding , dislocations appear ( fig .",

    "6 , we present the yield strain ( left axis ) and yield stress ( right axis ) as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "overall , the yield strain traces approximately the yield stress , and for large vacancy clusters , the yield stress / strain is significantly reduced comparing to the perfect lattice .",
    "however , the vacancy effect on the mechanical strength is more complex than the simple monotonic behavior .",
    "more atomistic studies are required to unravel the complicated vacancy - dislocation interactions .",
    "-vacancy clusters under uniaxial strain . ]",
    "we have calculated the formation energy @xmath16 of the vacancy clusters under uniaxial strain up to 0.062 beyond which some of the defect systems start yielding .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ca ] ) for representative vacancy clusters - the results of all vacancy clusters have the same general features .",
    "it is found that the formation energy decreases monotonically as a function of strain for all clusters .",
    "this is because vacancy formation energy results from the energy cost of bond breaking around the vacancies . by applying tensile stress ,",
    "the bonds are weakened owning to the stretching , therefore it would cost less energy to break them comparing to the strain - free case .",
    "the present result is consistent with that in al obtained by orbital - free density functional theory calculations @xcite .",
    "it appears that some of the energy curves tend to converge ( or cross ) at larger strains , for example , @xmath78 .",
    "the apparent convergence suggests that a large stress can change the relative stability of vacancy clusters of different sizes , which may trigger structural changes among them .     under uniaxial stain @xmath9 for several representative vacancy clusters . ]     under uniaxial strain @xmath9 for several representative vacancy clusters ]    the binding energy per vacancy @xmath20 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cb ] ) .",
    "the binding energy remains positive for all strains less than 0.062 . for most of the vacancy clusters , the binding energy decreases as a function of strain because the attractive vacancies are pulled apart by the stress .",
    "it appears that large strains could lead to break - up or re - arrangement of the vacancy clusters .",
    "next we study the behavior of the vacancy clusters under isotropic volumetric tensile deformations . in this case of triaxial loading ,",

    "the energy / stress curves of the defect systems trace closely to that of the perfect lattice , indicating the vacancy clusters do not change the behavior of the material before yielding .",
    "overall , both the yield stress and strain decrease as a function of @xmath1 , suggesting that vacancy clusters can drastically reduce the yield strength of the material .",
    "it should be noted that the quantitative values of the yield stress / strain obtained here do not correspond to the realistic situation due to the high vacancy concentrations in the simulations ; however , the qualitative features remain to be valid .",

    "( [ fig : c3a ] ) .",
    "overall , we find that the formation energy first increases with the strain to a maximum and then decreases ; this is different from the uniaxial case .",
    "the difference is due to the different loading conditions : in the uniaxial case , the volume of the system is fixed , therefore to a good approximation , the surface area of the void is also fixed . on the other hand , the surface area of the void increases as the volume increases in the triaxial case , therefore the inner surface energy increases as a function of the tensile strain .",
    "the increasing surface energy dominates the decreasing bonding energy contribution at small strains , hence the formation energy reaches a maximum at an immediate strain . for small vacancy clusters , such as @xmath93 and @xmath94 ,",
    "the surface energy contribution is negligible owing to the small size of the vacancy clusters , thus their formation energy increases monotonically .     under the volumetric strain @xmath9 for several representative vacancy clusters . ]    for the volumetric strain , the binding energy per vacancy increases monotonically with the strain , and it increases faster when @xmath1 is larger . such a behavior can be understood again from the liquid - drop model . under the volumetric strain @xmath9 ,",
    "the volume of a monovacancy is @xmath95 where the linear strain @xmath96 .",
    "thus the two coefficients in eq .",

    "<S> we find that the formation energy of the vacancy clusters decreases monotonically as a function of the uniaxial strain , while the formation energy increases first then decreases under the volumetric tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic stability of the vacancy clusters is analyzed by calculating the gibbs free binding energy and the total probability of dissociation of the vacancy clusters at 300 k and 900 k under uniaxial and volumetric strains . </S>",
    "<S> we find that although most of the vacancy clusters appear to be thermodynamically stable , some of the immediate sized clusters have high probability of dissociation into smaller clusters . </S>"
