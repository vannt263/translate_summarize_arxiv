    "in this report , we study diffractive processes at high energies which are predominated by the pomeron exchange . the pomeron is a color singlet object which can be associated with the two - gluon state @xcite .",
    "the cross section of inclusive hadron production is expressed in terms of ordinary parton distributions where partons have the same momenta . the diffractive reactions , which should give significant contribution to inclusive processes at small bjorken @xmath3 , have a different nature .",
    "really , in the diffractive hadron leptoproduction , like vector meson and @xmath4 production , the nonzero momentum @xmath5 carried by the two - gluon system ( pomeron ) appears and the gluon momenta can not be equal . as a result",
    ", these processes can be expressed in terms of skewed parton distribution ( spd ) in the nucleon @xmath6 where @xmath2 is a fraction of the proton momentum carried by the outgoing gluon and @xmath7 is the difference between the gluon momenta ( skewedness ) @xcite .",
    "investigation of the diffractive reactions should play a key role in future study @xmath8 at small @xmath2 .",
    "for the processes which involve the light quark production both quark and gluon spd will contribute especially for not small @xmath2 .",
    "we shall discuss here the diffractive charm quark production and @xmath1 production where the @xmath9 exchange in the @xmath10 -channel is not important because the charm quark content in the proton is rather small . in these reactions",
    "the predominated contribution is determined by the two - gluon exchange ( gluon spd ) .",
    "analysis of such diffractive reactions should throw light on the gluon structure of the proton at small @xmath2 @xcite .    to study spin effects in diffractive hadron production , one must know the structure of the two - gluon coupling with the proton at small @xmath2 . in the leading log approximation ,",
    "the ladder gluon graphs give predominating contribution . in a qcd  inspired diquark model of the proton @xcite , such graphs have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the model generates the spin - dependent @xmath11 coupling at moderate momentum transfer . using the results of @xcite ,",
    "the following form of the coupling has been found @xmath12 here the functions @xmath13 have dependence on the transverse part of the gluon momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the structure @xmath15 in ( [ ver ] ) is a coupling which determines the spin - non - flip contribution .",
    "the term @xmath16 leads to the transverse spin - flip in the vertex which does not vanish in the @xmath17 limit .",
    "the first two terms of the vertex ( [ ver ] ) are symmetric over the @xmath18 indices .",
    "they are equivalent to the isoscalar electromagnetic nucleon current with the dirac and pauli nucleon form factors @xcite . in the model @xcite , the form ( [ ver ] ) was found to be valid for the momentum transfer @xmath19 and the @xmath20 amplitude was caused by the meson - cloud effects in the nucleon . within this model , a quantitative description of meson - nucleon and nucleon  nucleon polarized scattering at high energies has been obtained @xcite .",
    "the model predictions for polarization for the pp2pp experiment at rhic was made in @xcite .",
    "the expected errors are quite small and the information about the spin - flip part of the coupling ( [ ver ] ) can be obtained experimentally . in a qcd  based diquark model the @xmath20 contribution is determined by the effects of vector diquarks inside the proton @xcite , which are of an order of @xmath21 .",
    "diquarks provide an effective description of nonperturbative effects in the proton .",
    "the single spin transverse asymmetry predicted in the models @xcite is about 10% for @xmath22 which is of the same order of magnitude as has been observed experimentally @xcite . these model approaches",
    "are consistent with experiment and give the ratio @xmath23 the asymmetric structure in ( [ ver ] ) is proportional to @xmath24 and can be associated with @xmath25 .",
    "it should give a visible contribution to the double spin longitudinal asymmetry @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it does not appear for elastic scattering ( @xmath27 ) and the value of this structure is not well known from our model estimations .    in this report",
    ", we shall analyze spin effects caused by the structures @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it will be shown that such effects will be small in the @xmath26 asymmetry .",
    "this means that , most likely , they do not provide additional problems with extracting the @xmath30 term from the @xmath26 asymmetry in the hadron leptoproduction at small @xmath2 .",

    "the spin - average and spin - dependent cross section can be written in the form @xmath71 here @xmath72 is a normalization function which is common for the spin average and spin dependent cross section . the planar contribution to @xmath73 ( sum of diagrams with non - crossed quark lines )",

    "the numerator of the integral for the function @xmath57 ( [ btn ] ) is vanishing when the gluon momentum @xmath77 is going to zero as in the vector meson production .",
    "corresponding integrals for @xmath56 have a similar form .",
    "we see that the cross section of the diffractive @xmath0 production is expressed through the same skewed gluon distributions as the vector meson production but at a different scale .",
    "similar calculations have been made for the spin - dependent part of the cross section @xmath78 .",
    "we shall discuss here the @xmath79 asymmetry at compass @xcite .",
    "the obtained asymmetry is proportional to @xmath5 ( here @xmath5 is typically of about @xmath80 ) and has a weak energy dependence , fig .",
    "the predicted asymmetry is quite small and does not exceed 1% .",
    "it has a week dependence on the @xmath81 ratio .",
    "the @xmath40 dependence of the @xmath26 asymmetry of the diffractive open charm production can be estimated as @xmath82 with @xmath83 .    we know from the study of elastic scattering that the @xmath28 structure in ( [ ver ] ) is mainly responsible for the transverse asymmetry .",
    "not small single - spin asymmetry in @xmath0 production caused by the @xmath28 term has been predicted in @xcite .",
    "this term should contribute to the @xmath84 asymmetry with longitudinal lepton and transverse proton polarization .",
    "the calculation of this asymmetry is similar to the analysis of @xmath26 which was made before .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath84 asymmetry is not small and proportional to the @xmath81 ratio .",
    "also the @xmath84 asymmetry is proportional to the scalar production of the proton spin vector and the jet momentum @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the asymmetry integrated over the azimuthal jet angle @xmath86 is zero .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath84 asymmetry for the case when the proton spin vector is perpendicular to the lepton scattering plane and the jet momentum is parallel to this spin vector .",
    "the predicted asymmetry is show in fig .",
    "it is huge and has a drastic @xmath87 dependence .",
    "the large value of the @xmath84 asymmetry is caused by the fact that in contrast to @xmath26 , it is not proportional to small @xmath5 .",
    "in this report the double spin asymmetries in the diffractive hadron leptoproduction have been investigated using the two - gluon picture of the pomeron .",
    "we have considered all the graphs where the gluons from the pomeron couple to a different quark in the loop and to the single one .",
    "this provides a gauge - invariant scattering amplitude .",
    "our calculations show that the spin  dependent structure @xmath28 in ( [ ver ] ) does not provide a considerable contribution to the @xmath26 asymmetry .",
    "the predicted @xmath26 asymmetry is smaller than 1 - 2% .",
    "not small effects in the double spin @xmath26 asymmetry should be determined by the @xmath88 term of the vertex ( [ ver ] ) .",
    "this contribution was not investigated here but can be important for compass experiment at small @xmath3 .",
    "however , the results obtained here show that the diffractive asymmetry in the @xmath0 production vanishes as @xmath89 .",
    "we hope that this conclusion is true for the @xmath25 term , too .",
    "if so , such effects , most likely , do not provide additional troubles in extracting @xmath25 from the @xmath26 asymmetry .",
    "the reason is that the compass experiment is planing to study events of the charm quark production at small @xmath40 where the diffractive asymmetry is expected be extremely small .",
    "it is shown here that the @xmath84 asymmetry of the diffractive heavy quark production is determined by the @xmath28 structure in ( [ ver ] ) .",
    "this asymmetry is predicted to be not small , about 10 - 20% .",
    "it can give direct information about the spin - dependent structure @xmath28 in the @xmath11 coupling .",
    "note that it is usually difficult to detect an outgoing proton in fixed target experiments .",
    "then , the cross section integrated over the momentum transfer @xmath10 are measured .",
    "our analyses show that such an integrated asymmetry is smaller by a factor of 1.52 than the unintegrated values shown in figs 3 , 4 .",
