    "for more than three decades the physics of black holes ( bhs ) has attracted the attention of an increasing number of relativists , astrophysicists , string theoreticians and elementary particle physicists ( for a recent textbook cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most spectacular theoretical predictions is the hawking effect : due to quantum creation of particles a bh may evaporate with ensuing radiation having a thermal distribution @xcite .    however , there are well - known problems with the long - time evolution of bhs ( e.g.  in the form of the information paradox  cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) ) .",
    "although semi - classical models have established interesting insights , especially in the context of twodimensional ( henceforth @xmath0 ) dilaton gravity ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite with particular focus on the model by russo , susskind and thorlacius ) the main obstacle in such a discussion stems from the fact that a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity does not yet exist .",
    "moreover , already simple classical systems of gravity with matter are not exactly soluble which , in general , prohibits a nonperturbative treatment of quantum backreactions .    the present approach tries to circumvent these difficulties at the cost of several ad - hoc assumptions , some of which could be called `` natural '' .",
    "the main idea is that one allows for a continuous family of models labelled by one or more deformation parameters .",
    "the word `` deformation '' will be given a precise meaning when the assumptions are specified , but roughly speaking one has a family of actions labelled by these parameters .",
    "the difficult task is to establish an evolution equation for the latter .",
    "dynamics then will dictate the evolution of these parameters .",
    "if an attractor solution exists dynamical deformations imply the transition of the original model , e.g. the schwarzschild black hole ( ss bh ) , to a specific remnant geometry , namely the attractor .",
    "thus , rather than trying to find one model describing an evaporating bh from the early stages until the very end we have a family of models at our disposal and at each instant one family member provides the most adequate description of geometry .",
    "provided the notion of light - like infinity ( @xmath1 ) makes sense  this will be one of the ad hoc assumptions  one can imagine an asymptotic observer who patches all these models together along @xmath2 lines , where @xmath3 is the retarded time .    to be more concrete , the assumptions chosen in the present paper are 1 .",
    "the restriction to consistent deformations in the technical sense of barnich and henneaux ( roughly speaking , neither gauge degrees of freedom nor physical degrees of freedom may appear or disappear , but the gauge symmetries may be deformed , e.g.  from an abelian gauge symmetry to a nonabelian one ) , 2 .",
    "the assumption of asymptotic flatness of each spacetime solving the equations of motion of the deformed action during the whole process of evaporation , 3 .",
    "the absence of nonextremal horizons to avoid extremal endpoints of the evolution ( actually , a further technical assumption will be imposed which , however , can be relaxed ) , 4 .",
    "an observer at spatial infinity ( @xmath4 ) is assumed who measures a constant hawking flux , i.e.  the increase of energy loss of the black hole due to the hawking effect is compensated by a corresponding boost of the observer .",
    "it is emphasized that this is merely a technical trick to allow for an easier derivation of the attractor solution .",
    "of course , consequently practically nothing can be said about what happens at a given instant during the evaporation in terms of `` physical time''for this information not only the existence of such a boost but the precise value of the boost parameter would be needed .",
    "but since our task is much more humble  we are only interested in the specific form of the remnant geometry and not a thorough description of the complete dynamics",
    " these assumptions will be sufficient to provide a unique answer for the remnant geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the four assumptions relevant for the ss bh are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] . as a result due to the evaporation process",
    "the ss bh is deformed towards an effectively @xmath5 dimensional model  in more picturesque ( albeit slightly misleading ) terms the celestial sphere evaporates into a celestial circle . a physical discussion of the results ( e.g.  the life time of a ss bh , its line element , the relevance of planck scale contributions , dilaton evaporation , consequences for the information paradox and cosmological implications ) in sect .  [ sec:4 ] and",
    "possible relaxations of the assumptions ( sect .  [ sec:5 ] ) conclude this work .",
    "complementary material can be found in the appendices : appendix [ app : def ] recapitulates deformations of generic dilaton gravity ; a possible generalization which relaxes the technical assumptions is discussed in appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "a simple toy model from classical mechanics which mimics some of the main features of bh evaporation as described in the present work can be found in appendix [ sec : cm ] .",
    "the ss bh is the simplest of phenomenologically relevant bh models .",
    "once the long time behavior of this case is understood it appears that generalizations to reissner - nordstrm or kerr - newman are comparably easy .",
    "more will be said on this in sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] ; for now the focus will be on the ss bh .",
    "the formation process is completely neglected in these considerations .",
    "it is assumed that space - time has `` settled down '' after the collapse of matter and an approximately stationary situation is encountered .",
    "a `` natural '' working hypothesis , namely that no deformation occurs and spacetime remains ss for all times , leads to the usual prediction of an explosive evaporation during the final stage , being the result of applying the semi - classical approximation beyond its limit of validity , because eventually quantum backreactions will deform geometry appreciably .",
    "it is noteworthy that no assumption is made regarding the type of matter coupled to gravity .",
    "it is just taken for granted that some matter degrees of freedom supporting the hawking radiation actually do exist .",
    "specifying matter explicitly has the disadvantage that one would have to find an exact solution of the coupled matter - gravity system in order to study the long time evolution of an evaporating bh .",
    "the present approach circumvents these difficulties at the price of several ad hoc assumptions .-",
    "deformations @xcite .",
    "recent generalizations of some of these results to `` gravity with an invariant energy scale '' exist @xcite , but one has to be careful with the definition of the line - element @xcite . a different philosophy which appears to be closer to the one of the present work consists of taking the hilbert - einstein action without further structure as starting point @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient in that reference is a running newton constant .",
    "the causal structure is like that of a reissner - nordstrm bh because an inner horizon develops .",
    "the outer horizon decreases , like in the present approach ; there seems to be a regular ds core ( as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "however , as a careful analysis in their work shows nonetheless a singularity at @xmath6 is present , because the newton constant scales differently in ds and ss near @xmath6 .",
    "a minimal bh size of order of planck mass is found and a cold remnant is reached after infinite time ( note : a similar cold remnant has been found also in @xcite for einstein - dilaton - gauss - bonnet gravity ) . ]      in many instances ",
    "take for example the singularity theorems in general relativity ",
    "it helped to distinguish between the principal part of assumptions ( e.g.  one has to specify an energy condition ) and their specific form ( e.g.  the strong energy condition ) .",

    "some of these generalizations are addressed in sect .",

    "in this subsection ( and only in this one ) some actual meaning will be attached to the coordinate @xmath3 . it will be assumed that the time it takes for the bh to evaporate as measured by the asymptotic observer is actually related to @xmath3 . in the early stages this is obviously justified , because @xmath105 , where @xmath29 is the `` physical '' ( retarded ) time .",
    "however , for order of magnitude estimations the difference is negligible because as pointed out before the bh has to radiate away a lot of its mass before it is deformed appreciably .    applying the @xmath0 stefan - boltzmann law ( [ iso0.5 ] ) to the energy loss of an evaporating bh yields",
    "the proper life - time estimate then reads where the proportionality constant is close to unity . for a ss bh the approximate evaporation time",
    "is given by @xmath106 , which agrees with the standard estimation .",
    "the reason is that initially the bh for a long time looks like the ss bh  only in the last instances relatively dramatic changes do occur .",
    "one of the extraordinary properties of the ss bh is its negative specific heat , being quite remarkable from a thermodynamical point of view .",
    "thus it is of interest to check whether this feature changes or not . from ( [ iso0better ] )",
    "we obtain clearly , the specific heat is negative for the models considered here ( @xmath107 ) . at @xmath23 the ss result @xmath108 is recovered . for @xmath109",
    "the specific heat vanishes like @xmath110thus , as the attractor solution is approached the specific heat vanishes .",
    "it has been advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite that the negative specific heat is not only a sign of instability but also a sign of inconsistency of the canonical approach . applying a microcanonical analysis a mass loss rate different from the canonical one has been obtained .",
    "thus , also the life - time estimate differs from ( [ iso7 ] ) . it could be interesting to repeat the analysis of the present work for the microcanonical case .",
    "since so many results are available at semi - classical level it is appropriate to discuss at least some of them from the perspective developed in this paper .",
    "first of all , the semi - classical derivation of the hawking flux in the context of @xmath0 dilaton gravity ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) and the corresponding mass - to - temperature law has been applied to obtain ( [ iso0better ] ) ; in a sense , we have pretended that at each step in the evolution the system can be described by an eternal bh at semi - classical level , but which of the infinitely many eternal bhs is the most proper one changes according to the evolution equation for the deformation parameter ( [ iso2better ] ) .",
    "so each of the intermediate `` eternal '' bhs has to fulfill the semi - classical approximation only for an infinitely small time interval .",
    "we should mention that spherically symmetric quantum deformations of the ss bh have been considered perturbatively already a decade ago by semi - classical means @xcite .",
    "also , the fact that dimensional reduction and renormalization need not commute does have a certain impact on semi - classical considerations @xcite .",
    "another interesting development is related to the question whether a near extremal ( reissner - nordstrm , kerr or desitter ) bh can evolve semi - classically towards its extremal limit .",
    "there is some evidence that the answer is negative @xcite .",
    "this would imply that our restriction to non - extremal horizons is justified and singles out the attractor solution as the most likely endstate of bh evaporation in a more general frame .",
    "but clearly semi - classical considerations are not sufficient to decide these important questions conclusively .",
    "due to the relation @xmath111 semi - classical methods work very well only for macroscopic ss bhs .",
    "a complementary ansatz has been developed in @xcite : instead of integrating out the matter fields on a given background , geometry has been integrated out ( exactly ) and perturbation theory has been imposed upon the ensuing non - local non - polynomial effective theory , depending solely on external sources and matter degrees of freedom .",
    "this approach preserves unitarity and works very well only for microscopic ( virtual ) bhs @xcite .",
    "since the involved masses have to be much smaller than @xmath65 the absence of remnants in these papers is not in contradiction with the results of the present work .      by a continuous patching of models along @xmath2 lines a global @xmath0 line - element of an evaporating ss",

    "the third possibility ( which is the one favored by the author because of its simplicity and because of the issues discussed below in sect .",
    "[ sec : new ] ) is to assume that the evaporation process simply stops as the mass drops down to @xmath95 .",

    "imply the occurrence of a phase transition , because both induce a non - smooth change at a branch point .",
    "the order of this transition differs : while for the second scenario continuity has been maintained ( and thus one can call it a second order phase transition ) , the last version implies a first order transition .",
    "it has been shown in sect .",
    "[ se:3.4 ] that the mass is effectively converted to a purely geometric quantity of the attractor geometry , but energy conservation dictates that something has to happen with the final @xmath95 .",
    "there are two possibilities :    1 .   a remnant in the form of matter concentrated at @xmath6 exists .",
    "2 .   a thunderbolt emits a total energy of @xmath95 at the end of the evaporation process .    of course , it could be that both possibilities have to be combined .",
    "suppose for a moment the matter remnant scenario .",
    "a point particle in 2 + 1 dimensions corresponds to a cosmic string in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "then the question arises : whatever happened to spherical symmetry ",
    "how can it be that a spherically symmetric object ( the ss bh ) evolves into an object with a preferred axis ( the cosmic string ) ?",
    "it should be emphasized that the _ total _ mass of the cosmic string is bounded by @xmath95 ; thus , if it were infinitely long its mass density per unit length went to zero .",
    "possible interactions between cosmic strings and ss bhs have been discussed in the context of `` thorny spheres '' in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for a physical discussion see section 7.4 of @xcite and references therein . in a more physical setup including also angular momentum it is conceivable that the axis of the remnant string is aligned with the axis of rotation of the macroscopic bh .",
    "moreover , its length is unlikely to be infinite  a typical length scale to be expected would be around planck length and thus also the mass density will be of order of unity in planck units .",
    "such a finite size object violates spherical symmetry only moderately .      as mentioned the variant of a first order phase transition",
    "is favored by the author . while revising this paper a new work appeared @xcite which supports it",
    ". when talking about a phase transition one would of course like to know which are the two phases and what separates them ",
    "after all , so far we have achieved only a smooth transition towards the attractor geometry , so what can possibly provide the degree of nonsmoothness pivotal to a first order transition ?",
    "the answer is provided by the dilaton field : while before the evaporation is terminated the dilaton necessarily is non - constant ( it can be rearranged to be linear in one of the coordinates by exploiting the gauge degrees of freedom ) , afterwards it can be constant . therefore , the phase transition could be from a linear dilaton vacuum to a constant dilaton vacuum . it will be argued in this section that indeed this is the case .",
    "thus , the current approach provides a realization of the semi - classically motivated conjecture @xcite that constant dilaton vacua might be the final state of bh evaporation .",
    "most dilaton theories ( [ vbh : sog ] ) allow for one or more constant dilaton vacua @xmath146 , where the constant is determined by the zero(s ) of the potential and thus the dilaton is unconstrained . ]",
    "@xmath147 ( cf .",
    "2.1 of @xcite )",
    ". the corresponding geometry can only be ( a)ds , rindler or minkowski space .",
    "thus , the only constant dilaton vacuum exhibiting the mgs property is minkowski space .",
    "because also the attractor solution ( [ iso14 ] ) with @xmath81 is minkowski space it seems that the dilaton has evaporated to a constant dilaton vacuum .",
    "however , there is an important subtlety ( cf .",
    "sect .  3 of @xcite ) :",
    "if the attractor solution is patched to such a constant dilaton vacuum along a @xmath2 line then a matter flux is induced on it , which is remarkable insofar as curvature is continuous ( namely zero in our particular case ) .",
    "this provides a mechanism for a shock wave like evaporation of the final @xmath95 .    at this point",
    "it should be recalled that the observer is a noninertial one  naive semiclassical extrapolation implies that the boost velocity has to approach the vacuum velocity of light in the limit of vanishing mass ; this is nothing but an ultrarelativistic ( aichelburg - sexl @xcite ) limit !",
    "incidentally , the shock - wave induced by such a limit in @xmath0 dilaton gravity takes the same form as the shock - wave which arises when patching a constant dilaton vacuum to a non - constant dilaton vacuum @xcite .",
    "thus , the scenario with the first order phase transition fits nicely together with the boost of the observer implicit in the assumption of isothermality .",
    "actually , exploiting the results of @xcite one can even provide an educated guess for the total energy emitted in the thunderbolt : only half of the final bh mass will be emitted , because the discontinuous directional derivative of the dilaton , @xmath148 in the notation of @xcite , jumps from a constant to minus this constant .",
    "however , patching to a constant dilaton vacuum implies that it jumps only to zero , i.e. , half of the amount as compared to an ultrarelativistic boost  because the height of the jump sets the scale for the energy emitted by the shock wave it seems that only half of the mass of the final state can be emitted in the thunderbolt , the other half will reside in a cold remnant .",
    "although the first order formulation so far has been avoided it will be considered in this paragraph because there is a nice target space interpretation of the phase transition .",
    "a reader who is not familiar with psms can skip this paragraph or may consult appendix [ app : def ] and references therein .",
    "there are two basic differences between symplectic manifolds and poisson manifolds : the poisson tensor can have a nonvanishing kernel and its rank need not be constant . indeed , in dilaton gravity there is always a nonvanishing kernel and the corresponding conserved quantity is related to the total energy ( essentially the adm mass , whenever this notion makes sense ) .",
    "but the rank is constant , namely 2 , except for eventual isolated points where it vanishes ( like the bifurcation 2-sphere in the ss bh ) .",
    "the evaporation to a constant dilaton vacuum corresponds to a transition to a region where the rank of the poisson tensor vanishes !",
    "thus , before the phase transition the world sheet geometry is defined by symplectic cuts in target space , while afterwards it is defined by a single point in target space .    to conclude , the phase transition is not one between two different geometries ( because the line element for the attractor solution is equivalent to the one for the constant dilaton vacuum ) , but between different behaviors of the dilaton field .",
    "it can be understood in terms of an ultrarelativistic boost of the observer .",
    "a similar mechanism could be of relevance for scalar - tensor theories in @xmath8 ; there , a constant dilaton vacuum simply corresponds to a phase where the effective newton constant does not vary .",
    "it is difficult to avoid addressing the information loss puzzle ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) when discussing the long time evolution of bhs .",
    "the main two alternatives are 1 .",
    "the information is lost , as proposed by hawking @xcite and 2 .",
    "some mechanism exists that prevents the information loss .",
    "most people with a field ( or string ) theory background favor the second variant . in the following",
    "it will be discussed very briefly which of the proposed solutions fits into the current approach .",
    "the quantum hair solution does not fit into the current formalism since the formation process has been neglected .",
    "also the possibility that the information is emitted together with the hawking radiation is not applicable here , at least not without specifying the matter content of the theory ; neither is the baby universe scenario , at least not in an obvious way . since",
    "a remnant geometry has been predicted there remain two natural solutions : either the information is retained in the remnant or it emerges at the end of the evaporation process . due to the fact that the proposed remnant geometry is flat it is hard to see where any information could be stored ( apart from the scenario with a cosmic string remnant ) , so the only possibility seems to be that the information is released during the final stages .",
    "indeed , this is what the carter - penrose diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] seems to suggest , as well as the discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : new ] .",
    "it will be studied in more detail below .",

    "thus , it is worthwhile to study the present carter - penrose diagram fig .",

    "the consideration of test particles will be useful .",
    "note that in the language of the s - matrix approach to quantum black holes @xcite the `` hard matter '' components implicitly have been taken into account by our assumptions .",

    "let us start at some value of advanced time @xmath149 at @xmath150 and follow the light rays until they are reflected at the origin and eventually emitted to a point at @xmath27 corresponding to a certain value of the retarded time @xmath151 . if @xmath152 is sufficiently close to @xmath153 then @xmath154 , i.e.  the outgoing ray will pass solely through region i , encounter the infalling matter flux and finally pass through ii .",

    "of course , rays starting closer to @xmath157 will additionally pass the apparent horizon , but so far no pathological features were found . at @xmath128 there is the problem of the potential singularity encountered at the origin .",
    "recently it has been proposed to impose a boundary condition at the singularity @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a critical comment ) as a possible path to a solution to information loss ; in the present context it is not quite clear whether the singularity exists at all as it lies in the very region we could only speculate about .",
    "so let us diregard it and focus on the region at @xmath150 that has not been covered so far : @xmath158 but still sufficiently far away from @xmath153 such that light rays are not scattered to region ii .",
    "such a test particle will trespass the line @xmath129 and be reflected at the origin still in region i. however , it crosses the infalling matter shock wave between @xmath129 and @xmath130 thus entering region iii .",
    "it will follow on a curved path more or less parallel to the apparent horizon and then pass the outgoing shock wave . in region iv it moves first again towards the origin and after the reflection it finally reaches @xmath27 .",

    "moreover , there exists a region @xmath161 with some finite @xmath162 where information may arrive in two ways : either directly from @xmath150 with only one reflection or with two reflections and inverted causality , as described in the previous paragraphs .",

    "however , none of these consequences provides a `` smoking gun signature '' .",
    "moreover , as mentioned before , it is not unlikely that eventually non - spherical modes will become relevant during the evaporation process , which further limits the phenomenological relevance of the present work .",
    "[ [ brief - summary ] ] brief summary + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let us finally repeat the lines of reasoning underpinning the approach presented in this paper : it is generally expected that during the final stages of bh evaporation some drastic changes will occur , since the semiclassical theory extrapolated to the very end predicts its own failure . in order to discuss the issue of long time bh evaporation in more detail either quantum gravity must be applied or some trick must be used .",
    "it has been proposed to follow the latter route by assuming an isothermal observer at @xmath4 , i.e.  the asymptotic hawking flux ( and hence the hawking temperature ) as measured by this observer does not change during the whole evaporation process .",
    "it can be replaced by a much weaker condition , namely boundedness and positivity of the asymptotic hawking flux . as a consequence  together with `` natural '' assumptions regarding the asymptotics , the causal structure , the nature of allowed quantum deformations of gravitational symmetries and some simplifying technical assumption further restricting the allowed deformations  an evolution of the ss bh towards a remnant geometry ( [ iso14 ] ) with @xmath81 has been predicted .",
    "we speculated about the final flicker , argued in favor of a first order phase transition to a constant dilaton vacuum , discussed briefly implications for the information paradox and concluded with possible generalizations of our postulates .",
    "if nothing else , the present approach shows that quantum induced deformations of the gauge symmetries of gravity can play a pivotal role for the understanding of the long time behavior of black holes .",
    "this work has been supported by projects p-14650-tph and j-2330-n08 of the austrian science foundation ( fwf ) .",

    "this appendix is meant to be self - contained . its purpose is to review concisely some features of ordinary and deformed dilaton gravity which are ( at least implicitly ) relevant for the rest of this paper .    to this end ( only in this appendix ) the first order version of ( [ vbh : sog ] ) @xcite @xmath172\\ , , \\label{eq : dvva1}\\ ] ] will be employed where @xmath11 is the dilaton field , @xmath173 is the zweibein one - form , @xmath174 is the volume two - form .",
    "the one - form @xmath175 represents the spin - connection @xmath176 with @xmath177 being the totally antisymmetric levi - civit symbol .",
    "the action ( [ eq : dvva1 ] ) depends on two auxiliary fields @xmath178 .",
    "it is a special case of a psm @xcite with the poisson - tensor ( @xmath43 and @xmath179 are arbitrary functions of @xmath180 ) which fulfills the ( generalized ) jacobi identity and a three dimensional target space the coordinates of which are @xmath181 . in light - cone coordinates ( @xmath182 , @xmath183 ) the first ( `` torsion '' ) term of ( [ eq : dvva1 ] ) is given by @xmath184 the function @xmath185 is an arbitrary potential depending solely on lorentz invariant combinations of the target space coordinates , namely @xmath11 and @xmath186 . to match the first order with the second order formulation one has to choose @xmath187 with the same functions @xmath14 as in ( [ vbh : sog ] ) . to match the psm with the first order version one has to choose @xmath188 , @xmath189 with    variation of the fields yields the equations of motion @xmath190 under the symmetry variation ( note that @xmath191 , where @xmath192 are the world - sheet coordinates and @xmath180 the target space coordinates ) the action ( [ eq : ka2 ] ) transforms into a total divergence the commutator of two symmetry variations closes only on - shell in general : @xmath193x^i & = \\de_{\\eps_3 } x^i\\ , ,   \\label{eq : psmpvn12 } \\\\ \\left[\\de_{\\eps_1},\\de_{\\eps_2}\\right]a_i & = \\de_{\\eps_3 } a_i + \\left(dx^j+ p^{jk}a_k\\right)p_{,ji}{}^{nm } \\eps_{1\\,m } \\eps_{2\\,n}\\ , ,   \\label{eq : psmpvn13 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with and @xmath194_{12}:=f(\\eps_1)g(\\eps_2)-f(\\eps_2)g(\\eps_1)$ ] .",
    "the introduction of the schouten - nijenhuis bracket @xcite allows to reexpress e.g.  the conservation law as @xmath195 , @xmath196 .",
    "according to izawa @xcite , consistent deformations in the sense of barnich and henneaux are those which leave the bracket structure ( [ def:2 ] ) essentially intact , i.e.  the poisson tensor may change its functional dependence on the fields @xmath180 , but its dimension ( and the fact that one stays within the realm of psms ) remains fixed .",
    "since izawa s result is of some importance for the present approach his proof will be sketched briefly : starting point is @xmath0 bf theory ( the conventions of @xcite have been translated accordingly ) which is just a very trivial special case of a psm ( [ eq : ka2 ] ) with vanishing poisson tensor .",
    "then , the minimal solution @xmath197 to the classical master equation and the generator of brst symmetry @xmath198 are constructed .",
    "a deformation @xmath199 of the lagrangian must obey @xcite this , together with its descent equations @xmath200 ,",
    "@xmath201 , allows to construct the most general consistent @xmath199 .",
    "it is given by eq .",
    "( 14 ) of @xcite .",
    "the deformed action satisfies the classical master equation and reduces to ( [ eq : ka2 ] ) for vanishing antifields .",
    "actually , it even satisfies the quantum master equation as there is no contribution from renormalization @xcite .",
    "no further deformations occur because @xmath202 fulfills the ( generalized ) jacobi - identity ( [ eq : jac ] ) , i.e.  the first order deformation of abelian bf theory , which is nothing but a psm , provides already the most general consistent deformation .",
    "thus , also the most general consistent deformation of a psm is just another psm ( with the same number of target space coordinates ) .",
    "it is important to notice that dilaton gravity , if formulated as a psm , requires additional structure , namely a correspondence between the gauge fields and the line element .",
    "the suggestive notation @xmath203 together with @xmath204 apparently fixes this structure in the undeformed case , but there is no a priori relation between the three gauge fields and the line element if deformed psms are considered .",
    "this subtle and important issue is addressed in detail in @xcite .",
    "for technical reasons the main part of the paper concentrated on the @xmath17 family . in this appendix",
    "the results will be generalized to the @xmath15 family , i.e.  to models with a lagrangian ( [ vbh : sog ] ) with arbitrary potentials @xmath206 and @xmath147 which fulfill the mgs condition and which have at most one horizon .",
    "all local and global classical solutions of such models have been discussed extensively in a series of papers by t.  klsch and t.  strobl @xcite . for a first orientation on classical , semi - classical and quantum dilaton gravity in @xmath0 the review ref .",
    "@xcite may be consulted .    in the following",
    "the notation and results of @xcite will be used ; for sake of self - containment we recall two definitions : the `` integrating factor '' @xmath207 and the conformally invariant combination @xmath208 as defined in ( [ def:1 ] ) .",
    "the mgs property reads @xmath209 .",
    "provided that the equation @xmath210 has exactly one solution for positive values of @xmath211 and no solution for @xmath212 the existence of at most one horizon is guaranteed .",
    "the constant @xmath211 scales like @xmath213 .",
    "the hawking temperature reads @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the solution of @xmath216 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the inverse function of the integrating factor , @xmath217 , because @xmath218 . with these preliminaries",
    "the hawking temperature for mgs models of the @xmath15 family with one horizon reads    now we would like to address the issue of boundedness of @xmath33 .",
    "suppose that @xmath219 is a given function of @xmath11 ( from this one can deduce all other quantities ) .",
    "first , it will be assumed that @xmath219 has a laurent series expansion of the form if @xmath220 then the leading term drops out after differentiation , so in this case the value for @xmath221 relevant in all subsequent formulas is given by the next to leading order term .",
    "for small values of the bh mass the hawking temperature is dominated by the highest power @xmath221 in ( [ app:2 ] ) ( and hence the discussion is essentially reduced to the @xmath17 family ) , thus , only for @xmath222 ( but @xmath223 , because this term drops out after differentiation ) the temperature remains bounded for all times .",
    "relevant examples / counter examples are the cghs model with @xmath224 and spherically reduced gravity from @xmath8 with @xmath225 , respectively .",
    "the attractor solution does not fit into this scheme because @xmath226 does not allow for an inverse ( but this model is rather trivial anyway ) .",
    "if there is a nonperturbative prefactor in front of the sum in ( [ app:2 ] ) which is regular at @xmath227 then again the highest term dominates and the same bound @xmath222 is recovered . if there is a different ( but at @xmath227 regular ) nonperturbative prefactor for each term then still the same conclusion holds .",
    "thus , the bound @xmath222 is rather general .",
    "if the prefactor is singular a different bound may be obtained ( e.g.  @xmath228 for a logarithmic prefactor ) .",
    "if the sum in ( [ app:2 ] ) does not terminate ( i.e.  @xmath229 ) then an essential singularity at @xmath227 is encountered . in order to decide whether @xmath33 remains bounded again the limit @xmath230 has to be considered . in cases where the laurent series can be resummed",
    "this is straightforward ( e.g.  for something like @xmath231}$ ] ) .    in principle one can also extract an mgs theory for a given temperature law ( if , for instance , the temperature law can be motivated by other means )",
    "the only mgs model with @xmath37 turns out to be the cghs .",
    "the only mgs model with @xmath232 is the ( trivial ) attractor solution . thus , if hawking radiation is assumed to stop at a certain point the attractor solution is the unambiguous remnant ( unless , of course , one allows for extremal horizons ) .",
    "a generalization of these considerations to non @xmath15 theories ( like e.g.  the class of models discussed in @xcite ) is possible in principle , but somewhat tedious in detail .",
    "suppose a dynamical system which can be described by a lagrangian action depending on two fields , one of them being called `` geometrical '' ( @xmath19 ) and the other one `` matter '' ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "suppose for simplicity that we are in 1 + 1 dimensions and that the geometrical part alone can be cast into a 0 + 1 dimensional form ( assuming staticity ) , but that we do not know how to solve the coupled system .",
    "instead , deformations of the geometrical subsystem will be studied and assumptions will be made which finally allow to obtain an attractor solution without having to specify the matter part .    to keep it basic , let the undeformed geometrical action be a harmonic oscillator @xmath234 where @xmath235 and @xmath101 is a quantity to be interpreted as `` radius '' .",
    "there is no gauge degree of freedom and one physical degree of freedom . in analogy to appendix [ app : def ]",
    "we want to find all consistent deformations in the technical sense of barnich and henneaux @xcite  i.e .",
    "the number of gauge degrees of freedom is not changed as well as the number of physical degrees of freedom , but the action may change as well as the gauge symmetries . often a perturbative analysis in terms of the deformation parameter is employed , but in the present paper the model is simple enough to go beyond perturbation theory . for the toy example",
    "deformations are rather trivial , is defined with antibracket @xmath236 ; then the brst charge is constructed , @xmath237 ; finally , the deformation equation @xmath238 together with its decent equation @xmath201 have to be solved , where @xmath239 is the deformed lagrangian .",
    "these methods @xcite ( cf .  also @xcite and references therein ) are being used in appendix [ app : def ] , but appear to be a slight overkill for the toy example . ]",
    "@xmath240 where @xmath241 is the deformation parameter and @xmath242 .",
    "we will simplify the issue further by requiring independence of @xmath243 or higher derivatives and impose linearity in @xmath244 and in the deformation parameters ( these requirements correspond to some of the `` physical '' assumptions that are imposed on the system and of course their validity should be justified ; however , as this is merely a toy example this is omitted ) .",
    "thus , we have a 1-parameter family of deformed geometrical actions at our disposal , @xmath245 initially , @xmath246 .",
    "let us impose the `` asymptotic '' condition @xmath16 and assume that the observer is located in the `` asymptotic region '' @xmath6 .",
    "then , the general solution of the equations of motion to be derived from ( [ eq : rev3 ] ) is @xmath247 the asymptotic observer patches together these solutions along @xmath248 lines , where @xmath249 is to be interpreted as `` time '' .",
    "now let me define a `` physical observable '' which i would like to call `` toy model hawking temperature '' : @xmath250 assume that the system can be reparametrized in such a way , that in the full dynamical system there is no time - dependence of @xmath33 .",
    "provided @xmath251 is positive and strictly monotonically increasing , @xmath252 has to be strictly monotonically decreasing . in the limiting case",
    "@xmath253 the deformation parameter @xmath252 must vanish .",
    "thus , the existence of an attractor solution @xmath254 has been established .",
    "however , nothing can be said about the speed of the transition to the attractor solution and of course its soundness depends on the validity of the assumptions made to derive it . finally , it has to be checked whether the constant @xmath24 in ( [ eq : rev7 ] ) has to scale to zero or not .    within this toy model",
    "it is even possible to provide a matter action explicitly : @xmath255 if @xmath256 is such that the solution of @xmath257 , @xmath258 , coincides with @xmath259 for all @xmath249 , then the patching procedure above reproduces the exact dynamics of the whole system close to the asymptotics @xmath6 ( which is the region relevant for the observer ) , because the equation of motion @xmath260 from ( [ eq : rev1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rev17 ] ) becomes equivalent to the one from ( [ eq : rev3 ] ) .",
    "however , it is emphasized that for the bh evaporation discussed in the rest of this paper no attempt is made to construct a corresponding matter action ."
