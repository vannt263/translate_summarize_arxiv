    "making a claim of a significant discovery requires exceptional evidence . in the field of particle physics , a common practice for declaring detection of a new particle is a `` 5-sigma '' level of confidence , meaning that there is probability of less than @xmath1 of the observation arising from sources other than the claimed discovery .",
    "detailed theoretical predictions for the gravitational wave signal helps reduce the false alarm ( or false positive ) rate due to glitches @xcite but searches for generic transient signals , known as gw bursts , have been hampered by an inability to distinguish non - gaussian noise artifacts , or `` glitches , '' and astrophysical signals at high confidence ( e.g. ref .",
    "background distributions for burst searches , determined by time - shifting the data from multiple detectors so that no coherent gravitational signals are in the data , show a long tail to high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , meaning that even a very strong gravitational wave signal would be consistent with having arisen from a glitch . in both the first and second joint ligo - virgo observation runs , simulated signals intentionally added to the data and included in the final analysis were recovered by burst algorithms with false alarm probabilities of order 10% and could not be identified as statistically significant events without using physically motivated waveform models  @xcite .    in preparation for the advanced detector era several new approaches to the burst detection problem have been developed .",
    "thrane and coughlin  @xcite have demonstrated the capability to make high - confidence detections of long - duration ( @xmath2 ) burst signals in non - stationary , non - gaussian noise by searching for excess power found along parameterized curves through a time - frequency representation of the data . in an independent effort , the bayesian parameter estimation analysis library ` lalinference `  @xcite , originally designed for the characterization of compact binary signals , has been adapted for burst analyses by using a sine - gaussian waveform as the gravitational wave template  @xcite . `",
    "lalinference ` differentiates between signals and glitches using a `` coherence test '' where the `` coherent '' signal hypothesis uses a template - based analysis assuming the data streams from multiple detectors contain a coherent gravitational wave signal while the `` incoherent '' glitch hypothesis treats each data stream independently .",
    "the incoherent model uses the same template waveform as the signal model but optimizes its parameters independently for each detectors data  @xcite .",
    "recently we proposed ` bayeswave`a bayesian algorithm to follow - up short duration ( @xmath3 s ) candidate gravitational wave transient events , separate signals from glitches , and provide robust signal characterization for arbitrary burst waveforms  @xcite . `",
    "bayeswave ` uses a variable - dimension model for signals and/or glitches enabling the analyses to adapt the complexity of the waveform model to match what is present in the data instead of imposing a template waveform and searching for best fit parameters . for a detection candidate ` bayeswave ` computes the relative evidence of the event being produced by a gw signal , an instrument artifact , or statistical fluctuations of the detector s gaussian noise . in the event that the candidate is of astrophysical origin , ` bayeswave ` also produces posterior distributions for the source sky - location and orientation , accurate waveform reconstruction , and metrics to characterize the signal such as duration , bandwidth , signal energy , etc . in all instances , ` bayeswave ` characterizes the instrument behavior including spectral estimation for the background gaussian noise and glitch reconstructions which can then be used to feedback into the never - ending effort to improve the interferometers performance .",

    "our results are achieved by analyzing data known to contain glitches which contributed to the long - tailed background distribution for the burst search , and by adding simulated gravitational wave signals to detector noise .",
    "in addition to this study using archived data , we present an analytical framework for understanding the performance of the pipeline .",
    "a companion paper uses ` bayeswave ` and the flagship burst search algorithm , coherent waveburst  @xcite , in an end - to - end demonstration of how burst detection efficiency is improved by the joint analysis  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : method ] we briefly describe the ` bayeswave ` algorithm , bayesian model selection , and our model for the data . in section  [ sec : math ] we go through a simple analytic calculation to give insight into how ` bayeswave ` is able to distinguish signals and glitches , and use ` bayeswave ` s performance on simulated signals added to real data to support the analytic approximations .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] uses the intuition built from the analytics to estimate background rates for glitches to be considered signals by ` bayeswave ` , and connects the bayes factor to false alarm rates for detections .",

    "the large scatter in bayes factors is due to failings in the laplace approximation , signals that violate our assumption about roughly equal snr in each detector , and segments of data that contain both signals and glitches .",
    "it is important to note that the high degree of scatter in the white noise burst results is also to be expected because these signals are unpolarized , while ` bayeswave ` assumes @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related by eq .",

    "@xmath53 will hinder our ability to reject glitches because the number of signal model and glitch model parameters will be comparable for a wider variety of waveform morphologies . while there is no reason to expect a priori that gw bursts will be elliptically polarized , selection effects by the detection pipelines which identify segments of data for ` bayeswave ` to follow - up in a real analysis , and the similar orientation of the ligo detectors , favor signals which are well approximated by a single polarization ( causing many of the degeneracies between extrinsic parameters discussed in the previous section ) .",
    "this assumption will need to be relaxed when more detectors are added to the network , and in future studies we will investigate strategies for optimizing ` bayeswave ` s performance on unpolarized detection candidates even in the two detector case .",
    "we have shown that ` bayeswave ` predictably favors the signal model over the glitch model for simulated gw events , i.e. ` bayeswave ` is robust against false dismissal of gravitational wave signals .",

    "while the right panel of figure  [ fig : prediction ] demonstrates how ` bayeswave ` can reject glitches in the trivial case of random sine - gaussian waveforms , how it will fair against real glitches , and how to assign significance to candidate events , requires more careful attention .    to understand ` bayeswave ` s glitch rejection capabilities ,",
    "imagine that a glitch waveform in ligo hanford ( @xmath130 ) is well represented by a linear combination of wavelets with parameters @xmath131 and a coincident ( i.e. within the light travel time between detectors ) collection of wavelets is found in ligo livingston ( @xmath132 ) .",

    "one can consider glitches to be random draws from @xmath135 space and false alarms ( glitches that appear as signals ) are draws that overlap within the size @xmath134 .",

    "we can use the same logic to estimate the background rate of glitches that are consistent with the signal model .",
    "assume , in a given two detector data set , there are @xmath136 coincident glitches .",
    "if we assume our signal / glitch model can achieve a perfect match to glitches in the data , the recovered snr of the signal and the glitch model will be equal when the glitches overlap in the @xmath135 space and the bayes factor will be again well approximated by eq .",

    "the occam factor thus takes on an additional interpretation as the expected number of trials ( coincident noise transients ) needed for two random glitches to have sufficient overlap in parameter space to look like a signal .",

    "the loudest noise event is obviously in the extreme tail of the background distribution and will therefore fluctuate wildly for different realizations of the data . nor is this a statement about the population of glitches beyond the assumption that the parameters @xmath135 are chosen at random for glitches in each detector .",
    "it is also important to point out this is may be a conservative estimate .",

    "the light travel time between ligo detectors is 10 ms , leading to a coincident glitch rate of @xmath142 .",
    "false alarm rates are estimated by analyzing time - shifted data , or `` time slides . ''",
    "if the data from one detector is shifted by more than the light travel time to another detector , there will be no coincident gravitational wave signals . because the rate of glitches completely dominates the rate of gw signals , analyzing time - shifted data all but guarantees that any coincidences are due to noise artifacts .",
    "consider the last quarter of ligo s sixth science run ( s6d ) which lasted for @xmath143 days .",
    "a so - called `` three sigma '' detection requires an event more significant than any background coincidences found in @xmath144 time slides .",

    "figure  [ fig : cwb_bkg ] shows the cumulative glitch rate as a function of @xmath147 i.e. the y - axis is the rate at which coincident glitches were found with bayes factors greater than the corresponding value on the x - axis .",

    "we find that sine - gaussian waveforms in a two detector network will be detected at false alarm rates that suggest marginal significance at any reasonable snr , similar to performance seen in past burst searches .",
    "however , unlike previous burst searches , we find that imbh and white noise bursts are detectable with very high significance .",
    "figure  [ fig : prediction_laplace ] in the appendix shows the number of wavelets used to recover each waveform morphology as a function of injected snr and provides supporting evidence that waveforms that require more wavelets typically provide higher bayes factors .    what is required for a high confidence , or `` five - sigma , '' detection ?",
    "for this case , we seek a p - value of less than @xmath1 , and so demand our event be louder than the loudest event in @xmath149 time slides . for s6d",
    "this leads to @xmath150 , and an expected loudest event @xmath151 .",
    "we have already seen that single wavelet events can not reach this level at any reasonable snr but applying the scaling law in equation  [ eq : approx_bayes ] , we find that such a `` gold - plated '' detection could be achieved at reasonable snr with as few as two or three wavelets .",
    "for example , the imbh and white noise burst signals in figure  [ fig : evidence ] added to the same data we used to estimate the background by far exceed the bayes factor which corresponds to a false alarm probability of @xmath152 .",

    "in this paper we have demonstrated ` bayeswave ` s utility as a follow - up analysis for gw burst searches . by analyzing data from the sixth ligo science run ( s6 ) which took place from 2009 - 2010",
    "we have shown that high confidence detections are achievable using ` bayeswave ` as a follow - up analysis despite the high rate of noise transients in the data . when used to follow - up short - duration gravitational wave triggers , ` bayeswave ` has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of false - alarms while remaining sensitive to a wide range of signals  @xcite . for insight into how ` bayeswave ` takes advantage of bayesian model selection to separate signals and glitches we presented an analytical framework and found simple expressions which provide approximations to our full numerical analysis on real data .",
    "the results show that ` bayeswave ` has several novel features , when compared with other burst pipelines :    * the detection statistic directly compares the evidence for an astrophysical signal with a glitch model , as opposed to calculating a likelihood derived from gaussian noise . * ` bayeswave ` places emphasis on the time - frequency complexity and network coherence of an event , rather than just its strength , to distinguish signals from glitches * the background distribution shows no evidence of `` tails '' at high values .    in order to emphasize the importance of including the glitch model in a statistical framework , best fit waveforms for the signal and glitch models for the most `` signal - like '' background events in s6d",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : cwb_alarms ] .",
    "for these examples of real glitches , the signal and glitch model are shown to very nearly agree . because glitches can be so successful in imitating real gravitational wave signals , pipelines which attempt to reject these events with tunings and cuts face a major challenge . instead , `",
    "bayeswave ` attempts to accurately assess the probability of such coincident glitches arising from chance .",
    "this approach places a lower weight to events with simple time - frequency structure that could plausibly arise simultaneously in two or more instruments , regardless of their snr .",
    "the detection statistic described in this work , @xmath153 , represents the likelihood ratio for two competing models : the data contains a glitch , or the data contains an astrophysical signal .",
    "the purist may object to this application of the bayes factor , instead favoring the bayesian odds ratio between the signal and glitch model .",
    "the prior odds ratio between these models is the ratio of the expected coincident and coherent glitch rate to the expected rate of gw signals .",
    "while the rate of gw signals is unknown , we have shown that the measured background distribution is consistent with our analytic predictions using the ligo glitch rate .",
    "this consistency suggests that the ` bayeswave ` model is a good fit to actual ligo data and bayes factors calculated by ` bayeswave ` will serve as a robust means for correctly identifying signals and glitches . in principle , glitches with non - flat distributions in f and q , especially if similarly distributed in multiple detectors , could invalidate this agreement .",
    "should that be the case , the posterior distribution of background events can easily be folded in to our analysis as a prior on the glitch model . because the glitch population in earlier ligo data will likely differ from that of the advanced detectors",
    ", we will continue to rely on the brute - force approach of using time slides to estimate the significance of a candidate event and use what is learned to further improve our priors for subsequently collected data .    as the capabilities of ground based detectors continues to improve so too must our analysis .",
    "the work presented here represents a snap shot of ` bayeswave ` s capabilities as the algorithm continues to advance .",
    "further development is underway to relax the requirement of elliptical polarization for the signal model ( improving the detection efficiency for unpolarized signals ) and to account for glitches and signals appearing in the same segment of data ( reducing false dismissals due to near - coincidence with glitches ) .",
    "nonetheless , based on the thorough performance studies in real ligo data reported in this work we conclude that ` bayeswave ` is prepared to decisively aid in the detection and characterization of gw bursts in the advanced detector era .",

    "the laplace approximation for the evidence is given by @xmath154 where @xmath155 are the maximum a posteriori parameters , @xmath65 is the model dimensions , and @xmath64 is the parameter covariance matrix , which we can estimate from the inverse of the fisher information matrix @xmath66 . if the prior is uniform for all parameters , the prior density is equal to the inverse of the prior volume : @xmath156 .",

    "one choice would be a uniform in volume prior on the source distribution , which is equivalent to a prior on the distance @xmath65 that scales as @xmath168 .",
    "since amplitude and distance are inversely related , we have @xmath169 . here",
    "we have made the change of variables to @xmath170 since this is the parameter used to compute the fisher matrix .",
    "this prior is improper , and to make it proper a minimum amplitude cut - off @xmath171 ( maximum distance ) has to be introduced .",
    "the properly normalized uniform - in - volume prior is @xmath172 an alternative approach , used by ` bayeswave ` in this work , is to adopt different physically motivated priors on the signals and glitches that are given as functions of the snr . for glitches",
    "the snr is given by @xmath173 while for signals the snr is given by the same expression , but with the individual detector noise spectral density replaced by the network average @xmath174 thus the signal - model snr depends on @xmath175 .",
    "the priors on the signal model and glitch model are given in terms of a prior on the snr , @xmath176 .",
    "making the change of variables from snr to @xmath170 yields @xmath177 for the glitch model and @xmath178 for the signal model .",
    "if we further assume little correlation between the wavelet model and the gaussian noise model , then the expected value for the log bayes factor between the glitch plus noise model and the noise model in a single detector is      here @xmath180 is the signal - to - noise ratio of the signal or glitch in that detector .",
    "later when considering a network of detectors the @xmath180 will refer to the network signal - to - noise ratio of the signal .",
    "if the wavelet model in one detector uses @xmath6 wavelets , and assuming little overlap between wavelets , then @xmath181 based on simulations , we find that the average number of wavelets used by ` bayeswave ` increases linearly with the total @xmath182 , and that the average per wavelet @xmath183 increases with the total @xmath182 as a waveform - dependent power law .",
    "writing @xmath184 and @xmath185 , we find that the values of @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath125 depend on the waveform morphology , with @xmath128 and @xmath127 increasing , and @xmath125 decreasing , as the time - frequency structure of the waveform becomes more complicated . in the case of a constrained model using a fixed number of wavelets",
    "the average snr per wavelet always increases linearly with the total snr , though with a proportionality less than one for anything other than sine - gaussians .",
    "[ fig : prediction_laplace ] shows the average number of wavelets ( left panel ) and snr per wavelet ( right panel ) as a function of snr for the three different waveform morphologies studied in this paper  sine gaussians , binary black hole mergers , and white noise bursts  added to simulated gaussian noise from a single detector at advanced ligo sensitivity .",

    "are the average and one standard deviations of the mean , plus lines that show the scaling relations using the best fit values for @xmath186 .        if we assume that all the wavelets have the same quality factor @xmath11 and individual signal - to - noise ratios @xmath188 , then the individual snrs in each detector are @xmath189 .",
    "thus for the glitch model @xmath190 , while for the signal model @xmath191 . then the bayes factor between the signal and glitch models for two collocated detectors is      here @xmath193 is the time frequency volume , and @xmath194 is the prior range for @xmath11 . note that the contributions from the amplitude prior introduce important snr scalings into the bayes factor . for a single sine - gaussian model",
    "the posterior volume terms introduce a @xmath195 scaling to the log bayes factor . for ` bayeswave ` the scaling with snr is far more complicated .",
    "on complex waveforms both @xmath196 and @xmath197 scale linearly with the snr , so the posterior volume introduces terms that scale as @xmath198 . the amplitude",
    "prior for the signal model introduces a similar @xmath198 scaling , along with a more complicated scaling of the form @xmath199 .",
    "the amplitude prior for the glitch model introduces @xmath198 terms , in addition to a term that scales as @xmath180 , though this term does not start to dominate until very high snrs ( @xmath200 for typical choices of @xmath201 ) . in the fixed dimension case",
    "the ` bayeswave ` scaling is dominantly of the form @xmath195 for moderate snrs . at",
    "very high snrs the quadratic dependence of the full ` bayeswave ` scaling is replaced by a linear scaling in snr .",
    "there are several assumptions that went into the derivation of the signal - to - glitch bayes factor for ` bayeswave ` that are rather crude .",
    "the worst approximations are that the wavelets used in the reconstruction all have roughly the same @xmath11 and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "while on average the scaling @xmath191 is quite robust , the @xmath188 for individual wavelets never go much below the value set by the peak of the snr prior , @xmath201 so that @xmath202 .",
    "this means that the linear scaling typically only holds for network snrs greater than around 10 or 12 . rather than assuming the same quality factor for each wavelet we could use the average value .",

    "this assumption is reasonable since each wavelet collects the power in a certain time - frequency volume disfavoring highly overlapping wavelets . for mis - aligned detectors we can write the parameter correlation matrix for the signal model in block - form as @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the @xmath209 correlation matrix for the intrinsic wavelet parameters ,",
    "@xmath91 is the @xmath210 correlation matrix for the extrinsic parameters and @xmath211 is the @xmath212 cross - correlation matrix that mixes the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters .",
    "the fisher matrix can similarly be decomposed : @xmath213 now , for partitioned symmetric matrices we have ( see page 46 of the matrix cookbook  @xcite ) @xmath214 which implies that the volume of the posterior factors into extrinsic and intrinsic pieces , where the intrinsic part has exactly the same form as for the glitch model : @xmath215        from here we can insert the snr scalings for @xmath196 , @xmath197 and the @xmath217 and include the explicit expression for the intrinsic parameter volumes in an effort to make quantitative predictions . while the expressions are more complicated than the aligned collocated case the scalings with snr are the same .",
    "we are unable to derive an analytic expression for @xmath218 .",
    "additionally , there is the problem that some of the extrinsic parameters , most notably the ellipticity and polarization angle , are poorly constrained and fisher matrix estimates are unreliable . as a result the posterior volume does not scale as @xmath219 as we naively expect from the fisher matrix , but as some lower power such as @xmath220 or @xmath221 .",
    "one way to incorporate the restriction that the posterior not exceed the prior is to elevate the extrinsic parameters from their fundamental domain ( with periodic boundary conditions ) to the universal cover , and introduce a gaussian prior on the parameters that restricts the posterior volume to be no larger than the prior volume .",
    "the negative hessian of second derivatives of the log of this prior is added to the fisher matrix ( so that the fisher matrix describes the curvature of the posterior , not just the likelihood ) . numerically computing the posterior volume as a function of snr using",
    "this approach shows that the posterior volume scales as @xmath222 , where the exponent @xmath116 is weakly dependent on the snr , varying between roughly 2 and 3 across the range of snrs we expects to encounter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prediction_laplace ] .",
    "the end result is that including the intrinsic parameters increases the dimension of the signal model by between 2 and 3 degrees of freedom , not 4 as we would naively expect .",
    "thus , the overall scaling for the single sine - gaussian bayes factor should scales as @xmath223 .",
    "the scaling for more elaborate waveforms is far more complicated .",
    "ultimately it is this added complexity that enables ` bayeswave ` to assign high - confidence to detection candidates of non - trivial gw signals .",
