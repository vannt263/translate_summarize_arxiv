    "there is convincing evidence from recent radio and optical observations that the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) exhibits significant subparsec - scale variations down to limits of a few au ( frail _ et al_.   1994 ; davis _ et al_.  1996 ; meyer & blades 1996 ; watson & meyer 1996 ) . on somewhat larger scales , strong variations in interstellar profiles",
    "are observed towards multiple late - type stars in globular clusters ( langer , prosser , & sneden 1990 ; bates et al .",
    "1995 ) . in some cases",
    ", the inferred densities of these structures far exceed the nominal diffuse cloud values and approach those of molecular cloud cores .",
    "for example , frail _ et al_. ( 1994 ) found pervasive variations in the opacity on scales of 5 - 100 au utilizing multiepoch observations of 21-cm absorption toward high velocity pulsars , which implied densities of @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "it is not clear how such small , dense structures can arise or be maintained in the low pressure environments of diffuse clouds .",
    "one difficulty with using the d lines as a tracer of small scale structure is the increasing saturation of these lines as one goes to larger column densities .",
    "thus the bulk of the gas in heavily reddened sightlines can not be sampled using the d lines , and one is generally limited to identifying variations in the weaker wings of the line .",
    "a potential probe of these sightlines is the @xmath47698  interstellar line .",
    "the lower cosmic abundance of k coupled with differences in the photoionization cross section leads to columns that are typically a factor of @xmath550 below those of in diffuse interstellar clouds ( hobbs 1974 ) .",
    "thus one can use to see if the small scale structure phenomenon extends from the very diffuse components that have been well sampled using the d lines ( watson & meyer 1996 ; meyer & blades 1996 ) to highly reddened sightlines such as hd 206267 ( this paper , @xmath6 @xmath7 0.50 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) cude feed echelle observations of the interstellar absorption towards members of 5 multiple star systems which have saturated interstellar profiles .",
    "these observations allow us to trace the small scale variations previously observed using to much more heavily reddened lines of sight .",
    "in addition , we present a simple method for estimating the possible differences in density in the clouds using the observed column variations .",
    "the observations were obtained in june 1998 with the 0.9 m cude feed telescope and spectrograph at kitt peak national observatory using camera 6 in echelle mode and a ford 3000 x 1000 pixel ccd chip .",
    "the resolution of the data was measured using the thar lamp emission lines and is @xmath8  @xmath9 at the location of the @xmath10  line .",
    "a total of 5 systems were observed : 4 binaries or common proper motion doubles and one triple system ( see table  1 ) .",
    "observations of the stars @xmath11 aql and @xmath11 leo were obtained as a template for dividing out telluric absorption in the vicinity of the 7698  line . for the majority of the stars ,",
    "exposures were taken on different nights at different grating tilts to reduce the effect of any flaws in the ccd chip . however , due to poor weather conditions observations of @xmath12 oph were limited to a single night and only a single exposure was obtained for hd 206267 d.    reduction of the data was done with the noao iraf echelle data reduction package .",
    "the individual frames were first bias - subtracted and flat - fielded , then the scattered light was removed .",
    "for all stars except @xmath12 oph the individual orders were then extracted and cleaned of cosmic ray hits . since both members of the binary @xmath12 oph were in the slit , only the portions of the combined stellar profile that were dominated by either one of the two stars",
    "were extracted .",
    "all of the resulting one - dimensional spectra were then wavelength calibrated , shifted to heliocentric coordinates , summed , and finally continuum fitted using low order polynomials",
    ". figures  1 and 2 show the final line profiles .",
    "the resulting s / n - ratios for these observations varies widely , from as low as @xmath020 for the faint star hd 206267  d to as high as @xmath13 for @xmath14 sco .",
    "column densities , b - values , and relative velocities of the various components were derived by profile fitting with the programs xvoigt ( mar & bailey 1995 ) and fits6p ( welty , hobbs , & york 1991 ) . the wavelength and oscillator strength of the 7698  line were taken from morton ( 1991 ) ; the inclusion of hyperfine splitting ( welty , hobbs , & kulkarni 1994 ) in the fits does not significantly alter the derived columns or b - values .",
    "the column density , b - value , and velocity of the various components were free parameters in the initial fits , while in the final fits the velocities of the components were fixed since the velocity differences between members of a system were smaller than the uncertainties .",
    "the resulting column densities are listed in table  2 ; the listed uncertainties include contributions due to signal fluctuations , continuum placement errors , and the errors induced by uncertainty in the b - values .",
    "it must be noted that if there is unresolved component structure that the column density may be higher than that listed . in particular , higher resolution observations of @xmath12 oph a suggest that there are at least three distinct components making up what is fit here as a single main component along this line of sight ( welty 1998 ) .",
    "as seen in figures  1 and 2 , significant differences in the absorption profile were seen between the interstellar lines towards the stars in 3 of the 5 systems .",
    "the detection of significant variation in the profiles of the within the saturated cores of the ( previously observed ) profiles shows that the small scale structures occur even in regions of high column density .",
    "it should be noted that the detection of widespread variation in and in multiple components make a circumstellar origin for the observed small scale structures significantly less tenable .",
    "for example , towards @xmath15 sco variations in are observed at @xmath16  @xmath9 and in in the main component at @xmath17  @xmath9 , with the enhancements in and columns occurring towards different members of the binary .",
    "one also sees variations in multiple components towards the hd 206267 system , but one must note that the hd 206267 system bears a striking resemblance to the trapezium ( abt 1986 ) , and like the trapezium is in a region of recent , active star formation .",
    "thus much of the variation towards this system may be in gas which is located relatively near the stars ( although not circumstellar ) , and may be the result of interactions between the surrounding medium and stellar winds and/or associated with the region ic 1396 centered on hd 206267a ( odell _ et al_. 1993 ) .",
    "while large differences were not detected towards @xmath12 oph ( hd 147933/4 ) or hd 161270/89 it is possible that significant variation could be hidden in the strong ( possibly saturated ) cores of these lines . in any case , the observed variations suggest that the small scale structures previously identified using are truly ubiquitous , and occur even in highly reddened sightlines .",
    "we can use the observed variations in the to infer the corresponding variations for comparison with previous optical studies of small scale structure .",
    "hobbs ( 1974 ) identified a relationship between the total line of sight column densities of and :      where n ( ) and n ( ) are in units of @xmath20@xmath21 . assuming the above `` typical '' relationship between n ( ) and n ( ) , we see that the observed variations correspond to variations as large as @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "thus small scale variations occur over 3 orders of magnitude in column density ( meyer & blades 1996 ; watson & meyer 1996 ; this paper ) , and therefore represent more than a population of small , low column clouds . furthermore , if we assume the `` typical '' relationship between n ( ) and n ( ) from hobbs ( 1974 ) , we can estimate the density @xmath24 in the structures responsible for the observed profile variations using the binary separation by assuming that variations in trace variations in .",
    "then the observed n ( ) differences imply @xmath25@xmath3 , similar to the densities inferred for a number of components in previous studies ( meyer & blades 1996 ; watson & meyer 1996 ) .",
    "such densities are also only slightly less than the densities ( @xmath26@xmath2@xmath3 ) inferred by frail _ et al_. ( 1994 ) in their study of 21-cm absorption towards high velocity pulsars .",
    "the lack of observable changes in the column density in components where the column varies towards the binary @xmath27 cru suggest that at least some fraction of the variation detected in the studies is due to density , temperature , or ionization fraction fluctuations , and thus not indicative of variations in the hydrogen column density between the lines of sight ( lauroesch _ et al_. 1998 ) .",
    "if we assume that the observed variations are due to similar fluctuations , we can use the measured column density differences to estimate ( albeit somewhat crudely ) the difference in density and temperature in these structures .",
    "the recombination rate for potassium is proportional to @xmath28 ( pquignot & aldrovandi 1986 ) ; if we assume a neutral ideal gas in pressure equilibrium then the recombination rate will go roughly as @xmath29 .",
    "typically it is assumed that the @xmath30 ratio is roughly constant in neutral interstellar clouds , with the dominant source of electrons being carbon atoms . under this assumption",
    "we can then estimate required density contrast from the observed columns since n()@xmath31 .",
    "we must note that as the density increases and/or the temperature decreases in these clouds there will be a corresponding increase in the n()/n ( ) ratio , and thus a corresponding decrease in the @xmath30 ratio .",
    "however , if n ( ) @xmath32 n ( ) in both clouds then the @xmath30 ratio will be roughly constant . in any case , we will initially assume @xmath30 is constant , and then identify ( if necessary ) any cases in which a correction is required .",
    "table  2 lists the column densities from our profile fitting analysis of these lines of sight .",
    "based on the measured differences in the column densities for the various components we have estimated the density contrast @xmath33 assuming an ideal gas with a constant @xmath30 , then :      where we have defined the strong and weak components such that n()@xmath38n()@xmath39 .",
    "thus all values of @xmath33 will be @xmath40 .",
    "looking at table  2 , we note that the estimated density differences are generally quite small , generally less than a factor of 2 .",
    "this shows how relatively small density and temperature fluctuations can give rise to large differences in the column densities of neutral species .",
    "there have been a number of simplifying assumptions made in the preceding argument which may not be correct .",
    "first , we have assumed that the observed column density differences reflect density and temperature fluctuations and not column variations . despite the lack of column density variations along the lightly reddened @xmath27 crucis line of sight ( lauroesch _ et al_. 1998 ) , the radio observations of pervasive variations in the 21 cm opacity towards pulsars and extra ",
    "galactic radio sources imply that some ( or even all ) of these structures may be associated with column density variations .",
    "in addition , these structures may not be in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium  since we have no information about the lifetimes of these structures we can not say whether they are stable structures or not . we have also assumed that the thermal gas pressure dominates in these structures , implicitly ignoring any magnetic field effects .",
    "thus we may have underestimated the magnitude of the density fluctuations in the sightlines . on the other hand",
    ", we have assumed that the @xmath30 ratio is constant , another possibility is that there are pervasive fluctuations in the electron density on small scales or that the ratio decreases in the denser clouds due to the recombination of carbon .",
    "only by directly measuring the densities ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) in individual components towards multiple systems through the use of diagnostics such as the and fine structure lines can the nature of these structures be fully explored .",
    "such ultraviolet observations will also enable the identification of any sightlines with column density enhancements similar to those inferred from radio studies .",
    "however , it must be noted that optical studies remain an efficient probe of small scale structures , and can be used to trace such structures on a variety of scales .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge the support of the staff of kpno , especially daryl willmarth .",
    "we would also like to thank ed jenkins , eric sandquist , dan welty , don york , and the referee for their valuable comments and suggestions .",
