    "for shape memory alloys , the change of entropy @xmath0 between high - temperature austenitic and low - temperature martensitic phase can be obtained either from calorimetry  @xcite or from results of stress - strain measurements at different temperatures above the martensitic start temperature @xmath5 ( ref .",
    "4 ) . owing to the diffusionless character of martensitic transformations , configuration contributions to the entropy change",
    "are absent , which considerably simplify the evaluation of the relative phase stability . in the case of thermoelastic martensitic transformations , which are characterized by a small temperature hysteresis and complete transformation to the austenitic ( martensitic ) state ,",
    "the change of entropy @xmath0 can be determined experimentally with a good precision .",
    "ni@xmath6mnga , a representative of the family of heusler alloys , undergoes a thermoelastic martensitic transformation on cooling below @xmath7  k. since ferromagnetic ordering in this compound sets at a considerably higher temperature , @xmath8  k , the martensitic transformation occurs in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are sensitive to stoichiometry .",
    "for instance , a partial substitution of mn for ni in ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga alloys results in increase of @xmath9 and decrease of @xmath10 until they couple in a composition range @xmath11 ( ref .  5 )",
    ". results of x - ray and electron diffraction studies of ni - mn - ga alloys indicate that the crystal structure of the martensitic phase depends on composition .",
    "the martensitic phase of the alloys with a low temperature of martensitic transformation ( @xmath12  k ) has a five - layered modulation whereas the martensitic phase with a moderate temperature of martensitic transformation ( @xmath13  k ) has a seven - layered modulation .",
    "@xcite for cu - based shape memory alloys , which transform to various martensitic structures upon cooling , it has been shown that the entropy change depends on the particular structure of the low - temperature martensitic phase .",
    "@xcite hence , similar behavior could be expected in the ni - mn - ga alloys .",
    "contrary to the cu - based shape memory alloys , which are nonmagnetic , ni - mn - ga alloys possess a long - range ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below @xmath10 .",
    "such distinct magnetic properties could result in peculiar behavior of the entropy change in ni - mn - ga as compared to nonmagnetic shape memory alloys .",
    "the purpose of this work is to perform a preliminary calorimetric analysis of the entropy change @xmath0 between the high - temperature cubic phase and low - temperature tetragonally based martensitic phases of ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga ( @xmath3 ) alloys .",
    "polycrystalline ingots of ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga ( @xmath3 ) alloys were prepared by an arc - melting method .",
    "the ingots were annealed in evacuated quartz ampoules at 1050  k for 9  days .",
    "sample for calorimetric measurements were spark cut from the middle part of the ingots .",
    "the calorimetric measurements were performed using a perkin - elmer differential scanning calorimeter with a heating / cooling rate of 5   k / min . in the experiments",
    "we have also used samples with the same thermal treatment from our previous work .",
    "an example of the calorimetric measurements of ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga alloys is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the direct and reverse martensitic transformations are accompanied by well - defined calorimetric peaks . from these data , it is easy to determine characteristic temperatures of the direct ( martensite start , @xmath5 and martensite finish , @xmath14 ) and the reverse ( austenite start , @xmath15 and austenite finish , @xmath16 ) martensitic transformation",
    ". results for the alloys studied , together with composition of the samples and the equilibrium temperature @xmath17 , are given in table  i. it is worth noting that transformation temperatures slightly differ for different samples of the same composition and the values of the temperatures presented in table  i are averaged over several specimens .",

    ".composition of the studied ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga alloys and the critical temperatures of the martensitic transformation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an analysis of @xmath18 contribution to the entropy change of cu - based shape memory alloys showed that the vibration contribution depends on the elastic anisotropy at the transformation temperature .  @xcite the authors found that for a given crystal structure of the martensitic phase , the elastic anisotropy constant @xmath19 at @xmath5 does not depend on composition , which means that vibration contribution to @xmath0 remains constant for all of the composition studied . in the case of ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga alloys , data on elastic anisotropy are absent .",
    "the observed increase of @xmath0 in ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga can indicate that elastic anisotropy depends on composition .",
    "however , since debye temperature did not change significantly with composition ,  @xcite it is more likely , that composition dependence of @xmath0 is accounted for by the magnetic contribution @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that entropy change in ni - mn - ga alloys depends on composition has already been mentioned in ref .",
    "10 , where ni - mn - ga alloys were divided into three groups according to their transformation behavior .",
    "the authors found that alloys with a low martensitic transformation temperature @xmath5 have low values of @xmath0 , whereas alloys with a high @xmath5 are characterized by higher values of the entropy change .",
    "their observations agree with the results of our study .",
    "since the crystal structure of the martensitic phase of ni - mn - ga depends on composition ,  @xcite an analysis of @xmath0 as a function of ni excess @xmath4 is worth performing . from the data shown in fig .",
    "2 , it is difficult to draw an unambiguous conclusion because the composition dependence of @xmath0 can be approximated in the whole studied interval of @xmath4 as shown by the dashed line .",
    "however , we suggest that the entropy change has different composition dependencies in concentration intervals @xmath21 and @xmath22 as shown in fig .  2 by the solid lines .",
    "the alloys with @xmath23 ( @xmath24  k ) are expected to have seven - layered martensitic structure , as evident from their high martensitic transformation temperatures and unusual behavior of resistivity ,  @xcite whereas the @xmath25 alloys undergo structural transformation to the five - layered martensitic structure .",
    "since different martensitic phases have different densities of vibrational states , this should lead to discontinuity of the composition dependence of @xmath0 as the martensite of the ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga alloys changes its modulation .",
    "if this is the case , the alloys with seven - layered modulation of the martensitic phase are characterized by a higher @xmath0 as compared to the alloys with five - layered modulation ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "in this article we have studied the entropy change at the martensitic transformation in ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga ( @xmath26 ) alloys .",
    "the lowest value of the entropy change , @xmath27  mj / gk , was found for the stoichiometric ni@xmath6mnga . upon substitution of mn for ni , @xmath0 significantly increases up to @xmath28  mj / gk in alloys with @xmath29 .",
    "the increase in @xmath0 is presumably due to the magnetic contribution .",
    "it is suggested that the change in modulation of the martensitic phase results in discontinuity of the composition dependence of @xmath30 .",
    "this assumption , however , requires further systematic studies of thermodynamic properties of ni - mn - ga alloys .",
