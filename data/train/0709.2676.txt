    "in the past decade or so overwhelming evidence has pointed to a clear coupling between accretion and the formation of relativistic jets in galactic x - ray binary systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "accretion states associated with hard x - ray spectra appear to be associated with the production of a relatively steady , continuously replenished and partially self - absorbed outflow @xcite , while major outbursts are associated with more discrete ejection events which may be resolved and tracked with radio interferometers ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the radio band",
    "the steady jets observed during the hard x - ray states have a flat ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ) spectrum , probably resulting from self - absorption in a self - similar outflow ( e.g. @xcite ) . above some frequency this flat spectral component should break to an optically thin spectrum ( @xmath6 ) corresponding to the point at which the entire jet becomes transparent .",
    "there is some evidence from some black hole x - ray binaries that this break occurs around the near - infrared spectral region ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , something which can be well fit by jet models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus the case is strong that there is a significant contribution of synchrotron emission , probably optically thin , in the near - infrared spectral regimes of x - ray binaries .",
    "however , one key test which is yet to be reported is a measurement of the linear polarization in this regime .",
    "not only would a high level of linear polarization confirm the synchrotron interpretation , it would offer us the opportunity to study the degree of ordering and orientation of the magnetic field at the base of the jet . in this paper",
    "we present near - infrared spectropolarimetry for a sample of luminous x - ray binaries , all of which can be confidently identify as jet sources based on radio observations .",
    "we obtained hk spectropolarimetry of three x - ray binaries scox1 , cygx2 and grs1915 + 105 with ukirt during the nights of 18 , 19 , 22 and 23 july 2004 .",
    "uist was used with the hk ( 1.4@xmath0m2.5@xmath0 m ) grism and the insb array with a 2 pixel wide slit , giving a spectral resolution of 680kms@xmath7 at 2.2@xmath0 m .",
    "we used the irpol2 polarimetry module which comprises of a half - wave retarder , a focal plane mask and a wollaston prism which splits the light from each aperture mask into orthogonally polarized ordinary ( o- ) and extraordinary ( e- ) beams which are then projected onto the array .",
    "rotating the half - wave retarder to 0.0@xmath8 , 45@xmath8 , 22.5@xmath8 and 67.5@xmath8 allowed us to obtained spectropolarimetry .",
    "the normalized stokes parameters are then determined from ratios of the two intensities measured in each frame , canceling any changes in sky transmission between images .    to determine the polarization spectrum we took short exposures of the target and sky pair ( obtained by nodding the target along the slit ) at the four half - wave retarder positions giving rise to 8 spectra of the target and a measurement of the polarization state of the target .",
    "the target spectra were proceeded by observations of an f or a - star , which were used to remove the telluric atmospheric features .",
    "furthermore , observations of a non - polarized object and a polarized object were observed to determine the instrumental polarization level and positional angle .",
    "a journal of observations is presented in table[table : log ]    the orac - dr pipeline was used to reduce the data , extract the spectra and determine the polarization state of the targets . first the bad pixel mask was applied and then the images were dark - subtracted , flat - field and sky - subtracted .",
    "the o- and e- beams were then optimally extracted ( which also allows for any slight spectral tilt ) and wavelength calibrated using the argon arc ( rms error of 1.7@xmath9 ) . @xcite",
    "have noted that the values of the shape of the polarization spectrum can depend on the the extraction technique .",
    "we used different methods ( optimal , normal extraction and tracing ) and find no such dependancy .",
    "polpack was then used to determine the intensity @xmath10 and the stokes @xmath11 and @xmath12 vectors .",
    "the flux calibration was done by using the telluric star .",
    "the target spectra were divided by the telluric star ( with the stellar features interpolated ) , and then multiplied by the flux of the telluric star , determined from a blackbody function with the same effective temperature and flux as the telluric star .",
    "in figure[fig : dered ] we show the dereddened hk spectra of scox1 , cygx2 and grs1915 + 105 using colour excess @xmath13 values of 0.3 @xcite , 0.4 @xcite and 6.3 @xcite respectively and the extinction law from @xcite . the @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "slit - magnitudes obtained after integrating the spectra with the filter responses are as follows ; @xmath14=11.6 , @xmath15=11.5 for scox1 , @xmath14=13.2 , @xmath15=13.0 for cygx2 and @xmath14=11.7 , @xmath15=11.4 for grs1915 + 105 .",
    "the dereddened spectra can be described as a power - law ( @xmath16 ) with indicies of 1.46@xmath17 , 0.98@xmath18 and 1.21@xmath19 for scox1 , cygx2 and grs1915 + 105 respectively .",
    "the slopes are not consistent with what is expected from a standard steady - state accretion disc ( index of 1.5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed the slopes are shallower and can be explained if the near - infrared flux contains a contribution from an optically thin jet .",
    "for each target we obtain eight spectra for each single set of observations of a target star . at each of the four wave - plate angles",
    ", we measure the flux in the two orthogonal ( o- and e- ) polarizations .",
    "these measurements are combined to produce the normalized stokes @xmath20 ( = @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( = @xmath23 ) spectra . the polarization spectrum @xmath24 and position angle @xmath25 is then be calculated using @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively . the stokes parameters may contain some component of instrumental polarization introduced by reflections within the telescope and detector optics .",
    "the instrumental polarization was determined from the non - polarized standard star observed each time the science target was observed , and was typically @xmath28% .",
    "the level and quality of the polarization spectra were not sufficient enough to allow us to resolve the variations in the polarization level across the major emission lines .",
    "the only reliable information that could be extracted was the continuum .",
    "in figure[fig : polspec ] we show the wavelength binned polarization spectrum for our targets . for scox1 we could not determine @xmath25 on ut 20040719 and so the polarization of the source was not detected .",
    "hence we only averaged the individual stokes @xmath20 and @xmath22 vectors on ut 20040718 and 20040723 before calculating the polarization spectrum .",
    "as one can see , scox1 and cygx2 both show polarization spectra that increase at longer wavelengths ( lower frequencies ) i.e. the 2.4@xmath0 m polarization is larger than the 1.65@xmath0 m polarization level . for grs1915 + 105",
    "the opposite is the case . in order to demonstrate that the trends observed in our science targets are genuine",
    ", we also show the polarization spectrum of a polarized standard star hd183143 determined in exactly the same way as for the science targets .",
    "the polarization spectrum is as expected @xcite . in table[table : obj ] we give the polarization and position angle values .",
    "although the polarization standard hd183143 can be used as a validation of the data reduction method , the standard is bright while the targets are faint , close to the sky background level , and so poor sky subtraction may introduce a correlation between target brightness and polarization level .",
    "however , it should be noted that scox1 and grs1915 + 105 have similar magnitudes but very different levels of polarization . to calculate the mean polarization at 1.65@xmath0 m and 2.4@xmath0 m",
    ", we assume that the stokes vector do not change over 0.10@xmath0 m ( @xmath29=90 pixels ) .",
    "we can thus calculate the mean stokes @xmath20 and @xmath22 vectors and determine the mean polarization .",
    "the uncertainty on these values is then the standard error , given that we have @xmath29 individual measurments of @xmath20 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the uncertainty in the mean polarization and position angle then follows by propagating the errors on @xmath20 and @xmath22 . given that our final mean",
    "polarization values are significant ( note that we average over 90 pixels ) a bias correction @xcite is not necessary , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "scox1 has a colour excess of @xmath13=0.3 so some interstellar polarization is expected .",
    "schultz , hakala , & huovelin ( 2004 ) fit the ubvri optical linear polarization values with the empirical formula of serkowski ( @xmath30 ; @xcite ) and find @xmath31=596 nm and @xmath32=0.70% ( @xmath33=0.01+@xmath31/602 ) .",
    "these values predict an interstellar polarization of 0.25% and 0.10% at 1.65 and 2.4@xmath0 m respectively .",
    "figure[fig : ispol ] shows the optical and near - infrared linear polarization values and the expected interstellar polarization .",
    "the mean linear polarization is 0.47@xmath19% and 1.3@xmath34% at 1.65@xmath0 m and 2.4@xmath0 m respectively .",
    "although the optical polarization may be described as interstellar , the @xmath14 and @xmath15-band polarization clearly can not .",
    "the overall optical and near - infrared polarization spectrum can be described by two components ; an interstellar polarization spectrum in the optical , and another component which dominates the @xmath14 and @xmath15-band polarization spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that recent broad - band jhk measurements of polarization of scox-1 agree with the values we obtain here @xcite .",
    "given that scox1 is known to be a powerful and variable jet source @xcite the component in the ir is most likely due to optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet ( see section[sec : jets ] ) .",
    "we can compare the near - infrared position angles with the position angle in the radio images of scox1 .",
    "the mean position angle of the radio jet on the sky is 54 degrees @xcite .",
    "this is approximately perpendicular to the near - infrared electric vector position angle which implies that the magnetic field is aligned with the jet ( assuming optically thin synchrotron emission ) .",
    "although polarization observations of cygx2 are limited , optical linear measurements show cygx2 to be 0.29% polarized , most of which may be intrinsic to the source @xcite .",
    "our ir linear polarization measurements of 1.7% and 5.4% at 1.65@xmath0 m and 2.4@xmath0 m respectively show a considerable excess in the near - infrared compared to the optical .",
    "it is clear that interstellar polarization can not explain the observed optical and near - infrared polarization values .",
    "the optical position angle of 36 degrees @xcite differs from our near - infrared value , however , this can be explained if the jet evolves with time .",
    "the different position angles at 1.65@xmath0 m and 2.4@xmath0 m can be explained if the different bands come from different regions . for a simple conical jet ,",
    "the jet size scales with wavelength , so a 2.4@xmath0 m jet would be ( 2.4/1.65 ) times larger than a 1.65@xmath0 m jet .",
    "cygx2 , like scox1 , is a radio source ( see @xcite ) and a member of the ` z - source ' and as such is also very likely to be a jet source ( although one has never been spatially resolved ) .",
    "grs1915 + 105 is a powerful relativistic jet source ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the single most convincing example of ir synchrotron emission , with ir flare like events unambiguously associated with similar events at millimetre and radio wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , at the time of the observations , radio monitoring with the ryle telescope at 15 ghz ( guy pooley , private communication ) indicated a low level of activity , with flux densities @xmath35mjy .",
    "our near - infrared linear polarization measurements of 7.5% and 5.0% at 1.65@xmath0 m and 2.4@xmath0 m may in fact be consistent with interstellar polarization , given the very high degree of extinction @xcite .",
    "however , we can estimate the maximum amount of interstellar polarization , given that there is a good correlation between the interstellar extinction and optical depth and thus polarization at 2.2@xmath0 m for field stars @xcite . for grs1915 + 105 the extinction of @xmath13=6.3 ( or @xmath36=19.5 mags ; @xcite ) gives an optical depth of @xmath37 and so a maximum interstellar polarization of @xmath38=3.3% .",
    "the observed polarization at 2.2@xmath0 m of 3.7@xmath39% ( calculated using the mean value over 0.10@xmath0 m ) suggests that the observed polarization may in fact be consistent with interstellar polarization",
    ". however , if the dust induced polarization contribution is low , then the radio jets ( mean position angle of @xmath40143 degrees ; @xcite ) is perpendicular to the electric near - infrared vector postion angle , implying that the magnetic field is aligned with the jet .",
    "in x - ray binaries significant linear polarization caused by electron scattering in an isotropic medium ( e.g. the environment of the accretion flow ) is expected at optical wavelengths .",
    "indeed the linear polarization property of the microquasar groj165540 in quiescence may be explained by such a mechanism @xcite , where the linear polarization originates from asymmetrical regions in the inner accretion disc ( electron scattering of the disc radiation by the secondary star is insignificant , because the secondary stars in lmxbs have low surface temperatures and therefore low free electron densities ) . in the case of the persistent lmxbs where the accretion disc dominates the optical light",
    ", the linear polarization should have a component that is produced by electron scattering by plasma above the accretion disc .",
    "although a strong interstellar component is present , for rayleigh and thompson scattering processes , the level of linear polarization decreases as a function of increasing wavelength .",
    "an excess weak component in the optical polarization is detected in scox1 @xcite , which is most likely due to electron scattering in the accretion disc .",
    "similarly , for cygx2 the optical polarization level has been measured to be 0.28% , which may be intrinsic to the source .",
    "however , we find the 2.4@xmath0 m linear polarization level to be considerably larger compared to the optical and so the 2.4@xmath0 m polarization can not be explained by interstellar polarization or by electron scattering . in both of these sources",
    "therefore there seems to be some intrinsic polarization of the near - infrared which probably can not be attributed to electron scattering . in the case of grs1915",
    "+ 105 the level of polarization is high but it does show the trend expected for interstellar scattering .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the ` excess ' near - infrared polarization is due to synchrotron emission from jets .",
    "two polarization signatures are expected from the jet , depending on whether or not the synchrotron emission is optically thick or thin . above some frequency",
    "this flat spectral component should break to an optically thin spectrum ( @xmath6 ; s@xmath41 ) corresponding to the point at which the entire jet becomes transparent ; i.e. emission at the break frequency arises primarily from the ` base ' of the jet ( although this may be still physically separated from the central accretor ) .",
    "for the optically thick part of the spectrum , which results in the flat spectral component ( @xmath4 ) observed in the hard x - ray state @xcite , no more than a few % polarization is expected .",
    "this is indeed observed for at least two hard state black hole sources in the radio band ( see @xcite )  however such a low level of polarization would be very hard to distinguish from the similar levels expected from scattering in an accretion disc and/or by the interstellar medium .",
    "there exists the possibility of a large fractional polarization level from optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "while it is by no means firmly established , a small number of observational and theoretical results suggest a break between optically thick and thin emission should occur around the near - infrared band ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "optically thick synchrotron emission has a maximum linear polarization of @xmath4010% @xcite , whereas optically thin synchrotron emission can have a fractional linear polarization as high as 70% @xcite , where the observed level is generally significantly less than this due to a mixing of regions with different magnetic field orientations and/or faraday rotations within one resolution element of the telescope .",
    "nevertheless , some x - ray binary jets show up to @xmath42% polarization @xcite , indicating a highly significant ordering of the magnetic field .",
    "figure[polfig ] illustrates in more detail our expectation for the intrinsic ( i.e. before interstellar scattering ) linear polarization signature in the near - infrared and optical regimes , based on spectral energy distributions published in @xcite and @xcite and the simple ideas outlined above about the expected polarization fraction . at long wavelengths ( maybe in the mid - infrared :",
    "the break is hard to determine precisely ) there will only be @xmath43% polarization from the self - absorbed jet ; at short wavelengths a comparable level will be measured due to scattering in the accretion flow .",
    "however , in the relatively narrow spectral region in which optically thin synchrotron emission dominates , we may expect a strong signature which initially rises to longer wavelengths as the relative jet : disc fraction increases .",
    "however , it should be noted that the break from optically thick to optically thin synchrotron and the normalisation of the disc component may vary from source to source , which will mean the width and peak of the high - polarization regime will vary .",
    "this is discussed in @xcite for the case of black hole sources and clearly illustrated by @xcite for the case of the neutron star 4u0614 + 091 where the break to optically thin synchrotron appears to occur at a lower frequncy than what is measured for the black hole source gx339 - 4 in @xcite .",
    "therefore the sketch in figure[polfig ] can only be regarded as schematic .",
    "given that the 2.4@xmath0 m polarization level is greater than the 1.65@xmath0 m polarization level suggests that the most likely origin of the @xmath15-band linear polarization in scox1 and cygx2 is from a jet .",
    "why the degree of polarization should be different by an order of magnitude between the two neutron star systems is unclear , but may relate to the accretion state ( i.e. branch of the ` z ' ) the sources were on at the time ( some branches seem to be more closely associated with jets than others , e.g. @xcite ) . these observations support the recent discovery with _",
    "spitzer _ of optically thin synchrotron emission in the ir band from another neutron star x - ray binary , 4u0614 + 091 @xcite . in the case of grs1915",
    "+ 105 the result is ambiguous and further observations will be required to see how it might vary in states when the jet is more powerful ( as indicated by e.g. simultaneous radio observations ) .    for scox1",
    "we find that the magnetic field is aligned with the jet ( see section[sec : scox1 ] ) , and the same for grs1915 + 105 if the dust induced polarisation contribution is low ( see section[sec : grs ] ) .",
    "both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields are seen in radio jets . in the radio polarization maps of cirx1",
    "one observes the polarization vector rotate through 90 degrees between the core and the jet @xcite .",
    "parallel magnetic fields are related to the intrinsic jet structure , perhaps helping to collimate the flow , whereas perpendicular magnetic fields indicate shocks , where the outflow is compressed along the jets axis @xcite .",
    "measurements of the linear polarization of the compact jet in the near - infrared can probe closer to the central black hole or neutron star than the radio band , and reveal the degree or ordering of the magnetic field close to the jets s base .",
    "furthermore , faraday rotation ( which is proportional to @xmath44 ) is insignificant at near - infrared wavelengths , so that the linear polarization electic vector position angle tells us directly about the orientiation of the magnetic field ( the two are perpendicular ) .",
    "the three measurements reported here , at least two of which indicate a significant contribution of synchrotron emission in the near - infrared , should be the beginning of a highly useful line of enquiry in the near future .",
