    "there are large number of experimental as well as theoretical studies regarding the electronic structures and properties of fe - based superconductors @xcite to establish the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity with high t@xmath1 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the highest transition temperature ( t@xmath1 ) till now for fe - based superconductors is 109k @xcite .",
    "correlation of superconducting transition temperature and other physical properties with structural parameters is well established @xcite .",
    "fe - as(pnictides)or fe - se(chalcogenides ) planes are back bone structures of these superconductors where as atoms are placed above and below the fe plane .",

    "it is also evident from literature that , as far as veracity of calculation of electronic structure is concerned , the role of structural parameters specially z@xmath2 is instrumental @xcite .",
    "fe - based superconductors are broadly classified into six families among them 122 family is the most studied family , both experimentally as well as theoretically .",
    "the main reason for that is the availability of high quality single crystal for 122 systems .",
    "it should also be noted that the parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is not superconducting in ambient pressure but it shows magnetic order in the form of spin density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "superconductivity appears in this system when sdw order is suppressed and that can be done either by applying hydrostatic pressure @xcite or chemical pressure _ i.e. , _ by doping .",
    "superconductivity can arise into the system by doping on any of the three sites including fe sites @xcite .",
    "another interesting case is isoelectronic ru substitution in place of fe which also forge the system to become a superconductor @xcite",
    ". electronic structure of all these doped 122 systems has been studied using first principles calculation based on density functional theory ( dft ) with a great success @xcite .",
    "but there are some challenges regarding the application of dft in fe - based superconductors whose electronic structure is very much sensitive to temperature , pressure and doping .",
    "we extend this issue in the theory and computational method section in a greater detail .    as mentioned earlier in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 system , one can dope on any of the sites to make it superconducting .",
    "phase diagrams of fe - based superconductors play a crucial role in the understanding of various physical properties , which are very sensitive to doping and temperature .",
    "a generic phase diagram of 122 family of fe - based superconductors consists of various phases like superconductivity , sdw order , c@xmath0 and c@xmath3 structural transition , nematic phase _ etc .",

    ". comparative study of calculated pdos of co / ni doped systems for both the methods reveals that in case of 50@xmath4 ni doping vca and sc method produce significantly different electronic structures .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ ni_pdos]b that the peak of the @xmath41-orbitals of ni and fe are at slightly different energies and sum of these two dos profiles produce the total @xmath41-orbital contribution .",
    "but in case of vca , pdos of the total @xmath41-orbital as shown in fig .",
    "[ ni_pdos]d is totally different from that of the sc calculation .",
    "although implementation of higher doping is not that much important in case of electron doped system as discussed earlier but one must concern about the fact that in case of higher doping concentration vca method is unable to simulate the accurate electronic structures .",
    "next we show in fig .",
    "[ ru_pdos ] , the simulated pdos of ru doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 system for vca and sc methods . in sc calculation",
    "( left ) we presented the @xmath41-orbital contribution of ru - d ( red ) as well as fe - d ( orange ) separately and total @xmath41 orbital contribution displayed by solid green line ( see fig .",
    "[ ru_pdos]a , b , c ) . on the right side of fig",
    ". [ ru_pdos ] total @xmath41-orbital contribution has been depicted for vca method .",
    "comparison of both the electronic structure reveals that in vca formalism , mixed @xmath41-orbital of ru and fe atom deviates from the pdos of total @xmath41-orbital calculated by sc method .",
    "although ru doping at the fe site is iso - electronic substitution but total number of electron as well as size of ru is much greater than that of fe .",
    "furthermore ru has @xmath50 orbital as the outermost orbital , whereas outermost orbital of fe is 3d .",
    "it also appears that in the low doping concentration , apart from an additional shift of the chemical potential in the calculated electronic structures by vca method , there is not much difference in the electronic structures calculated by these two formalisms .",
    "but in case of higher doping concentrations , electronic structure simulated using vca formalism deviates remarkably from that of the sc method .",
    "perhaps in vca formalism , the mixing of 3d ( fe ) orbitals with 4d ( ru ) orbitals which are more broader than 3d , is not implemented properly resulting an additional shift in the chemical potential in dos profile for vca approach .",
    "this discrepancy can be overcome in the low doping regime . in fig .",
    "[ fs ] ( left column ) we depict the calculated fss of ru doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems using vca formalism . in the right column , we present the fss of the same by giving an additional shift , which is estimated from the comparison of calculated dos by vca and sc methods .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fs ] that in the low doping regime the shifting of chemical potential work very nicely to produce the fss , that resembles with the experimentally measured fss as well as calculated fss using sc methods @xcite .",
    "but in case of higher ru doping concentration this shifting of chemical potential does not work to reproduce the fss accurately as evident from the simulated fs in the last row of fig .",
    "calculated fss using vca formalism in case of 40@xmath4 ru doping ( last row of fig .",
    "[ fs ] ) certainly not resembles with that of the sc calculation on 50@xmath4 ru doped systems @xcite .",
    "implementing vca and sc methods for doping , we have presented a detail comparative study of electronic structures of various doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems through first principles simulation .",
    "we have investigated the density of states ( including partial density of states ) , band structures and fermi surfaces of electron doped , hole doped as well as isovalently doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems for vca and sc approaches . in case of hole doping and iso - electronic p substitution on as site , both the methods produce very similar electronic structures as far as dos and bs calculations are concerned .",
    "calculated pdos of this system give clear indication about the fact that p doping in as site ( isovalent ) moderate fe - as hybridization .",
    "so in this case there is some difference in the calculated pdos for vca and sc approaches . in case of electron doped ( co / ni )",
    "bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems vca and sc methods provide very similar electronic structures for both the cases for low doping concentrations .",
    "but in case of higher doping concentration , we find that the calculated electronic structures are remarkably different for these two methods as clearly evident from the bs and pdos calculation of 50@xmath4 ni doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems . on the other hand , in case of iso - electronic substitution in fe site ( ru substitution in fe site ) , calculated electronic structure is very much dissimilar for different methods .",
    "an extra shift in the chemical potential is observed in the electronic structures of ru doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems , when vca method is employed for doping .",
    "but for higher ru doping concentration the electronic structures are quite different for these two methods",
    ". we also explicitly show that by considering this chemical shift in a proper way , one can simulate fss accurately by vca formalism in case of low ru doping concentration .",
    "this work give a clear idea about the application of vca and sc methods for calculating the electronic structure of various doped 122 systems of fe - based superconductors .",
