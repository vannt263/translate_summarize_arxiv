    "no peaks could be detected in the energy spectrum of @xmath37 coincidences from the @xmath11ca(@xmath4li , @xmath5)@xmath11ca reaction due to very scare coincidence events .",
    "the variation of the ( @xmath4li , @xmath5 ) reaction cross section with the increase of neutrons in the ca target was investigated with three ca isotopes .",
    "the relative @xmath0 strength for @xmath10ca target was about one - tenth of @xmath14ca target and in the case of @xmath11ca its upper limit was 0.14 percent .",
    "this shows that the increase of neutrons weakens the structure of the @xmath0 cluster in @xmath28ti nuclei .",
