    "the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) spectra of galaxies either with active nucleus ( agn ) and/or starburst ( sb ) show emission features attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) , which can be considered to be originated in very small amorphous carbon dust grains or very large carbon - rich ring molecules ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most prominent , well - known pah emissions , are the 6.2@xmath1 m , 7.7@xmath1 m , 8.6@xmath1 m , 11.2@xmath1 m and 12.7@xmath1 m bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides , the mid - ir spectral region also presents prominent forbidden ionic emission lines , such as [ neii]12.8@xmath1 m , [ nev]14.3@xmath1 m , [ neiii]15.5@xmath1 m , [ siii]18.7@xmath1 m and 33.48@xmath1 m , [ oiv]25.89@xmath1 m and [ siii]34.8@xmath1 m ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of the ionizing source can be assessed by computing the intensity ratios between forbidden lines such as [ neii]12.8@xmath1 m , [ neiii]15.5@xmath1 m and [ nev]14.3@xmath1 m ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the detection of [ nev ] at 14.3@xmath1 m and 24.2@xmath1 m or [ nevi ] at 7.6@xmath1 m , due to ions of high ionization potential , is an evidence of a hard radiation field associated with an agn @xcite .",
    "several diagnostic diagrams based on the line intensity ratios between the brightest ionic lines and the pah features have been proposed to classify the mid - ir spectra of galaxies according to the degree of activity ( agn , low - ionization nuclear emission - line region - liner , and sb galaxies ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite , using data from the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on board of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , propose the diagnostic diagram , [ oiv]25.9@xmath1m/[neii]12.8@xmath1 m versus the strength of the 7.7@xmath1 m pah band to separate star - forming galaxies from agns .    from the study of the mid - ir spectra of quiescent spirals , galactic hii regions , planetary nebulae , and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , @xcite found that the ratios between the 6.2@xmath1m/8.6@xmath1 m and 7.7@xmath1m/8.6@xmath1 m pah bands do not vary significantly ,",
    "while the ratios 6.2@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m and 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m varies over one order of magnitude .",
    "they concluded that the properties of the pahs for different types of galaxies are very similar and that variations of the pah band ratios are due to the fraction of ionized to neutral pah molecules .",
    "thus , this ratio could be used to analyze the physical conditions of the molecular gas in the regions where the emission is originated .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the equivalent width ( ew ) of pah features , observed in hii regions of the m101 galaxy are correlated with the ionization index , and does not depend on the hii regions metallicity .    according to @xcite the ionized to neutral fraction of pahs",
    "can be estimated using pah 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m ratio , which is sensitive to the type of nuclear activity , decreasing from sb to seyfert .",
    "these authors , suggest that this behavior is due to the selective destruction of the 7.7@xmath1 m pah molecule with the increasing hardness of the radiation field ( similar results are found by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such results are supported by laboratory experiments , which show that certain pahs are effectively destroyed by individual uv and x - ray photons , and can not survive within a few kiloparsecs from an active nucleus , unless they are shielded from the agn s x - ray emission by absorbing material @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the above results , concerning the ionization fraction of pah bands in agns are carried out with small samples of this type of object",
    ". therefore , we use the largest sample of agns and sb galaxies available up to date in spitzer public archive , to study in detail the effect of the hardness of the radiation field on the pah bands emission , in these kind of galaxies .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sample ] we describe the sample selection , data reduction process and emission line measurements . in sect .",
    "[ results ] we present results and discussions on the shape of the continuum spectra , emission line frequency and diagnostic diagrams of pah band ratios and emission lines ratios . sect .",
    "[ correlacaopahne ] we discuss the behavior of the ionization fraction and ew of pah bands with the hardness of radiation field . summary and conclucion are presented in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we have analyzed a well defined sample of 186 galaxies which have spitzer spectra available from public archive .",
    "being 83 agns taken from @xcite , 22 sb from @xcite , 59 hii and liner from @xcite and 7 hii regions of m101 galaxy from @xcite , plus 15 agns spitzer spectra published here for the first time .",
    "details on the reduction process of the 15 new objects are given below .",
    "the 15 new spectra of agn galaxies ( 4 sy 1 and 11 sy 2 ) were obtained from the spitzer public archive .",
    "observations were performed with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ? * ) using the short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) modules , covering the interval between 5@xmath1 m and 36@xmath1 m with a resolving power of 64 - 128 .",
    "the raw data were processed using the spitzer pipeline version 17.2 .",
    "the nuclear spectra were extracted using the spitzer irs custom extractor - spice .",
    "default point - source extractions were selected for all objects .",
    "only a few sources show a noticeable step in flux between the overlapping ll and ls module spectra , which results from the extended circumnuclear emission contribution to the size sl module slit of 3@xmath5.7 x 57@xmath5 and ll module slit of 10@xmath5.7 x 168@xmath5 .",
    "although the observed regions of almost all of the galaxies are large in both modules the agn light dominates the spectra . fig . [ profile ]",
    "shows the emission spatial profile of ngc3786 .",
    "note that the luminosity falls off to almost zero for @xmath6 3 pixels from the center of the nucleus .",
    "for this galaxy , 3 pixels correspond to @xmath6 1 kpc , adopting a radial velocity of 2678 km sec@xmath7 and a hubble constant of 74 km sec@xmath7mpc@xmath7 .",
    "the general parameters for the objects listed in table [ tabgeral ] were taken from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . all the spectra were corrected for redshift .",
    "the rest - frame spectra were grouped according to their activity , and are shown in fig .",
    "[ allnorm ] .      for the 15 new agns listed in the table [ tabgeral ] and",
    "sb taken from @xcite , low resolution irs spectra have been decomposed using the pahfit code , described in detail by @xcite .",
    "in short , they assume that the irs spectra are composed by dust continuum , starlight , prominent emission lines , individual and blended pah emission bands , and that the light is attenuated by extinction due to silicate grains",
    ".    the default input parameters of pahfit are : ( i ) the infrared emission from a blackbody with t= 5000k ; ( ii ) different weights for thermal dust continuum components represented by the temperatures 35 , 40 , 50 , 90 , 135 , 200 , 300k ; ( iii ) spectral line features , including the pure rotational lines of the molecular hydrogen ; ( iv ) dust features are represented by individual and blended drude profiles , which are theoretical frequency profiles for a classical damped harmonic oscillator and are the best choice to model pah emission . for more details see @xcite .    with the above constraints we were able to isolate the pah features and measure their fluxes , as well as those of the ionized gas emission lines .",
    "the fluxes and the ew are listed in tables [ fluxpah ] to [ fluxionic ] .",
    "we checked the consistency of the results with the liner code @xcite that integrates the flux of a gaussian function fitted to the line , obtaining similar results in both procedures .",
    "the observed irs spectra of mrk334 , a sy 1 galaxy , is shown in fig .",
    "[ pahfit ] , where we also plot the detailed components of the pahfit spectral decomposition model .",
    "clearly , the model reproduces well the observed spectrum .",
    "the main goal of this section is to characterize the continuum shapes and spectral features observed in the 15 new objects listed in table [ tabgeral ] , with respect to the type of nuclear activity ( sy 1 and sy 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we normalize to unity the continuum of all spectra at @xmath0 = 23 @xmath1 m and grouped them according to nuclear activity . for each agn class , data were sorted according to spectral shape , from bluest to reddest , top to bottom of fig .",
    "[ allnorm ] , respectively .",
    "one can clearly see that the majority of spectra have a continuum shape increasing for longer wavelengths , in agreement with results found by @xcite .",
    "this continuum range can be fitted with a warm blackbody distribution of t @xmath2 150  300k .",
    "interestingly , a similar trend in the continuum of agns is also observed in the near - infrared region @xcite .",
    "we compare the spectroscopic properties of the 15 new objects with those of the @xcite groups .",
    "we found that the spectra of the sy 2 galaxies : ngc3786 , ngc5728 , ngc7682 , mrk471 , mrk609 , mrk622 , mrk883 , mrk1066 , mrk883 and the sy 1 mrk334 and ngc4748 , have the same characteristic as their group 1 ( strong pah emission and red continuum , see fig [ allnorm ] ) . on the other hand the sy 2 , ngc 1275 , ngc2622 ,",
    "mrk3 and sy 1 mrk 478 can be classified as group 3 ( power - law continuum and weak pah features ) , while only the sy 1 mrk279 galaxy show a broken continuum and silicate emission at 9.8@xmath1 m ( group 2 ) . in summary , for our and @xcite samples",
    "the mid - ir spectra for most of sy 2 galaxies have same spectroscopic characteristics as those of group 1 ( @xmath8 50@xmath9 ) .",
    "[ hist ] shows a histogram of the commonest emission features present in each type of activity ( note that we have used the 186 galaxies spectra ) .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the pah features are present in almost all the sy 1 , sy 2 and sb galaxies , as well as the h@xmath10 molecules at 9.6@xmath1 m and 17@xmath1 m .",
    "in addition , the most frequent ionic lines are : [ siii ] 34.8@xmath1 m , [ arii ] 6.9@xmath1 m , [ siii ] 18.7 and 33.4@xmath1 m , [ siv ] 10.5@xmath1 m , [ neiii ] 15.53@xmath1 m and [ nev ] 14.3@xmath1 m .    all",
    "studied sb galaxies show pah bands and the following forbidden emission lines : [ siii]34.8@xmath1 m , [ arii]6.9@xmath1 m , [ siii]18.7 and 33.4@xmath1 m .",
    "in addition , nearly 80@xmath9 show molecular h@xmath10 lines .",
    "similarly , @xmath480@xmath9 of the sy 2 show pah features , and the same ionic lines detected in sb galaxies .",
    "however , we have found that pah lines in sy 1 galaxies behave differently from the other types of nuclear activity .",
    "the pah bands at 7.7@xmath1 m , 11.3@xmath1 m and 12.7@xmath1 m are present in 80% of the galaxies , but only 50% of them show the pah lines at 6.2@xmath1 m and 8.6@xmath1 m . nevertheless , the high ionization lines , such as [ nev]14.3@xmath1 m and [ oiv]25.8@xmath1 m are more common in sy 1 .",
    "numerical studies of the vibrational energy distribution of pah molecules show that the relative strengths of the 3.3@xmath1 m , 6.2@xmath1 m , 7.7@xmath1 m , 8.6@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m pah features depend on grain size and on the charging conditions @xcite .",
    "small pahs radiate strongly at 6.2@xmath1 m and 7.7@xmath1 m , while large pahs emit mostly at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "another important conclusion of @xcite is that neutral pahs have higher values of 11.3@xmath1m/7.7@xmath1 m ratio , while ionized pahs have lower ratios . on the other hand ,",
    "the 6.2@xmath1m/7.7@xmath1 m ratio decreases with the increasing number of carbon atoms of the pah molecules , fig . 16 from @xcite",
    "shows how the relative strengths of these emission vary depending on the size and charge state of pah molecules .",
    "@xcite used this diagram to analyze these pah ratios for a sample formed by galaxies dominated by star formation , galaxies with significant stellar and agn component and agn - dominated galaxies .",
    "they found a weak trend in the direction of constant ionization fraction with changing grain size .",
    "in addition , they suggest that the presence of an agn component is correlated with the reduction in the 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m ratio indicating that smaller pah grains ( number of carbon atoms @xmath11180 ) are destroyed in agns .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ pahs ] the theoretical intensity ratios , for neutral and ionized pahs ( 6.2@xmath1m/7.7@xmath1 m @xmath3 11.3@xmath1m/7.7@xmath1 m ) , from @xcite .",
    "the authors calculated these quantities assuming grains illuminated either by the @xcite spectrum or a blackbody with t= 3 x 10@xmath12k varying the number of carbon atoms in each molecule .",
    "we overplot in this diagram the observed pah emission line ratios of our sample .",
    "clearly , the observed ratios are located between neutral and ionized pah theoretical lines , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the above results suggest that the observed pah bands in both , agns and low ionization objects ( sb and liners ) , are formed by an appropriate mixture of pah molecules with different sizes and adequate neutral to ionized fraction .",
    "high ionization objects ( agns ) present a tendency for molecules @xmath8 180 carbon atoms ( 6.2@xmath1m/7.7@xmath1 m @xmath11 0.2 ) , on the other hand most of low ionization objects are biased towards molecules with less than 180 carbon atoms .",
    "the latter are typically located in the region 0.2 @xmath116.2@xmath1m/7.7@xmath1 m @xmath11 0.4 ( fig .",
    "[ pahs ] ) . furthermore",
    ", seyfert galaxies appear to be located near to region populated by ionized pah molecules , while the majority of sb , hii , and liner are near to the line representing the neutral pahs",
    ". moreover , these results are consistent with a picture that agn have higher ionization fraction and larger pah molecules than sb galaxies .",
    "another way to assess the ionization fraction of the pah molecules is using the following diagnostic diagram 6.2@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m @xmath3 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m .",
    "such diagram was used by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , they demonstrate that there is a good correlation between both ratios .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize the fact that both samples were mostly composed by sb galaxies .",
    "in addition , these ratios are controlled by the fraction of ionized to neutral pahs @xcite .",
    "in fig [ pahspahs ] ( top ) we show these diagram for our sample . clearly , if we only consider the sb galaxies our results are consistent with the correlation described above . by including the agns ( sy 1 and sy 2 ) ,",
    "an unexpected large dispersion is observed for both type of activity .",
    "alternatively , we also test the diagram 6.2@xmath1m/8.6@xmath1 m @xmath3 7.7@xmath1m/8.6@xmath1 m involving ionized ( 7.7@xmath1 m and 6.2@xmath1 m ) and neutral ( 8.6@xmath1 m ) pah molecules .",
    "this diagram is shown in fig.[pahspahs ] ( bottom ) , where a similar dispersion is observed .",
    "interestingly , in both diagnostic diagrams the ratios in the vertical axes tend to separate the agns ( sy 1 and sy 2 ) from sb galaxies .",
    "this is even clearer in the diagram involving the 7.7@xmath1m/8.6@xmath1 m ratio , leading us to the conclusion that 7.7@xmath1m/8.6@xmath1 m @xmath4 6 for agns",
    "( dotted line ) and smaller for low ionization objects .",
    "synthetic spectra in the 6.2@xmath1 m  9.0@xmath1 m region , for large symmetric pahs cations , anions and neutral , have been computed by @xcite .",
    "the trends , in the band position and intensite , is a function of the molecule size , charge and geometry .",
    "large pah cations and anions ( @xmath8 110 carbon atmos ) produce prominente bands at 7.7@xmath1 m and 8.5@xmath1 m , the intensite ratio 7.7@xmath1m/8.6@xmath1 m increase with the pah sizes .",
    "thus , we interpret the separation in activity types ( sb , sy 1 and sy 2 ) , along the vertical axis in both diagrams of fig .",
    "[ pahspahs ] , as due to the fact that in average the emitting pah molecules in seyferts are larger than those of sb .",
    "in addition , we suggest that the high values for the ratios 7.7@xmath1m/8.6@xmath1 m and 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m is due to the fact that almost all the molecules are ionized . in summary , we point out that both diagrams ( figs . [ pahs ] and [ pahspahs ] )",
    "clearly shows that the ionization fraction and molecules size increase from sb to agns .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that , no separation between seyfert type is observed .",
    "although , the four ratios depends on the pahs ionization fractions , ratios involving 6.2@xmath1 m band have the same range of variation for both types of nuclear activity .",
    "this can be associated with the fact that the 6.2@xmath1 m pah emission is due to small molecules @xcite , which probably are destroyed by the hard radiation field of seyfert galaxies .      as shown in sect .",
    "[ freqemlin ] ( fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) , forbidden ionic emission lines are observed in sb and active galaxies . in the first case , the gas is ionized by massive hot stars , while in the latter the ionization is due to a non - thermal continuum .",
    "moreover , the emission cloud in agns are located in the narrow line regions ( nlr ) @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir emission from dusty nlr of agns has been explored by @xcite .",
    "their models give a direct connection between the dust emission and the line emission from the photoionized gas .",
    "these authors also show that the emission line ratios [ nev]/[neii ] @xmath3 [ neiii]/[neii ] can be used to separate agns from sbs .",
    "in addition , @xcite using starburst evolutionary models , which incorporate new stellar atmosphere models for massive stars , found that [ neiii]/[neii ] is sensitive to hardness of the radiation field .    in fig .",
    "[ nene ] we show the diagnostic diagram [ nev]14.3@xmath1m/[neii]12.8@xmath1 m @xmath3 [ neiii]15.5@xmath1m/ [ neii]12.8@xmath1 m for our sample .",
    "we also overplot the nlr models for different ionization and pressure parameters taken from @xcite .",
    "clearly , all the observations have values lower than those predicted by the models . in this diagram , agns are closely correlated , while the sb galaxies show a large scattering .",
    "the [ nev]14.3@xmath1 m has a high ionization potential of 97.1 ev and is often detected in spectra of agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) however is rarely detected in sb galaxies @xcite .",
    "the lack of correlation for sb galaxies in this diagram , thus , may be due to a strong contamination of [ nev ] with pah 14.19@xmath1 m emission or to the absence of the former line in the sb galaxies spectra .",
    "in addition , we call the attention to the fact that the deblending of these lines is very difficult in the low resolution spitzer spectra .",
    "it is also clear in this figure that sy  1 galaxies have [ neiii]/[neii ] @xmath4 0 , while sb and sy  2 have this ratio @xmath13 0 ( solid line in fig .  [ nene ] ) .",
    "this suggests that both line ratios are sensitive to the hardness of the radiation field , confirming the result of @xcite . the fact that sy  2 galaxies are spread over the lower left of the fig .",
    "[ nene ] can be associated to @xcite predictions , which states that starburst contribution would move the points in that direction .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are 3 sb galaxies located in the top - right side of fig .",
    "[ nene ] ( ngc1097 , ngc4676 and ngc520 ) .",
    "the former , was reclassified as sy 1 by @xcite , while the two latter are strongly interacting sources and may have the these emission lines enhanced @xcite .",
    "thus we suggest that further , more accurate studies ( i.e. with higher spectral resolution spectra ) , are necessary to better explain the position of the sb galaxies in the diagram .",
    "@xcite have studied the correlation between the intensity ratio of the strongest pah bands 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m with the hardness of the radiation field indicator , [ neiii]/[neii ] . they have found that galaxies with hii regions or starburst optical spectra exhibit a nearly constant 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m across the whole range of radiation hardness , including low - metallicity galaxies , which have [ neiii]/[neii ] @xmath11 2 .",
    "in contrast , the agns are located below the hii - type galaxies and their pah ratio falls rapidly with increasing radiation field .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite through the analysis of pah emission bands of a sample of 92 typical star forming galaxies .",
    "they interpreted the decrease in the pahs band ratio for agns as due to a selective destruction of the ionized 7.7@xmath1 m pah molecules .",
    "the variation of 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m pah bands , observed in our sample ( 186 objects ) , with respect to the hardness of the radiation field , is shown in fig .",
    "[ pahne ] .",
    "it is clear from this figure , that the fraction of ionized to neutral pah bands does not depend on the hardness of the radiation field in contrast with the previous results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we interpret this behavior as due to the fact that the strengths of both pah bands would have the same dependence on the radiation field .",
    "besides , this diagram show a tendency in the sense that sb galaxies have [ neiii]/[neii ] @xmath11 0.4 , while for sy 1 and sy 2 [ neiii]/[neii ] @xmath8 0.4 . in addition ,",
    "sy 1 are biased towards location on the upper right corner .",
    "some of the sy 2 galaxies are located in the sb region , which suggest that these galaxies may have a circumnuclear starburst .",
    "no clear separation between sy 1 and sy 2 is observed for [ neiii]/[neii ] @xmath8 0.4 .    in order to test the dependence of the pah bands strength with the radiation field , we compare in fig .",
    "[ ewpahs ] the ew of the 7.7@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m pah bands with [ neiii]/[neii ] hardness indicator .",
    "it can be seen that ew of both pah bands are constant with the radiation field indicator for [ neiii]/[neii ] @xmath13 0.8 , and fall rapidly with the increasing radiation field .",
    "galaxies , powered by star formation , have a nearly constant ew across the full range of [ neiii]/[neii ] .",
    "while for sy  1 the ews of the pah bands decrease rapidly , for the sy  2 the ew values are distributed either in the sb or sy  1 region .",
    "their location in the diagram may reflect the stellar or agns dominant component contribution to the spectra ( i.e. in some case the sy  2 may be dominated by a non - thermal component , and in other by circumnuclear massive star formation ) . in order to have a more quantitative analysis of fig .",
    "[ ewpahs ] , we have computed an exponential regression taking into account all objects ( agns+sbs , dotted line ) and another for a sub - sample formed only by agns ( solid line ) . for the latter we have found a correlation coefficient of @xmath2 -0.7 while for the former we have not found any correlation ( @xmath2 -0.2 ) .",
    "we conclude this section by arguing that both pah molecules , either ionized ( 7.7@xmath1 m ) or neutral ( 11.3@xmath1 m ) , may be destroyed with increasing hardness of the radiation field .",
