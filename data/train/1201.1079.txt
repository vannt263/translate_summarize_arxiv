    "spiral galaxy formation is shaped by a number of key dynamical processes , including galaxy - galaxy mergers , gas accretion from cosmic filaments and internal processes driven by disk instabilities .",
    "understanding how these mechanisms combine to produce the range of morphologies observed in the local universe is one of the great challenges for galaxy formation theory .",
    "mergers have been shown to be important for the formation of elliptical galaxies and for the growth of bulges in spirals .",
    "in particular , major mergers can transform disks into ellipticals @xcite , especially when they involve two relatively gas - poor galaxies , which can often be the case at low redshift .",
    "the end - product of gas - rich mergers is more complicated , with early studies arguing that the merger remnant can still contain a large rotating disk @xcite , while recent simulations resolving the star - forming regions and capturing supersonic turbulence suggest that disk survival is very unlikely @xcite .",
    "while major mergers are violent events strongly impacting a galaxy s morphology , they are relatively rare in a @xmath8cdm context . minor mergers ( with mass ratios lower than 4:1 ) are much more frequent and can also induce bulge formation @xcite , either by adding satellite stars to the center of the galaxy @xcite or by triggering gas inflows followed by central starbursts @xcite .",
    "however , the bulge fraction and srsic index of the remnant depend strongly on the detailed properties of the merger .",
    "mass ratio is one of the key parameters : mergers with mass ratios between 4:1 and 10:1 are the most efficient at heating the galactic disks @xcite .",
    "smaller mergers only slightly perturb the disks , except if they are frequent enough @xcite .    in the end , the effect of mergers on disk galaxies is still debated , and even if they temporarily destroy disks , new disks could reform from the infall of fresh gas from cosmic filaments . at low redshift ,",
    "mergers become less frequent and gas accretion can then play an important part in slowly building stellar disks around pre - existing bulges .",
    "gas accretion however is not always slow and steady , particularly at high redshift where cold flows can rapidly accumulate large amounts of gas in galactic disks and make them violently unstable @xcite .",
    "these gas - rich and unstable disks fragment and are observed as having a clumpy morphology in high - redshift galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the clumps migrate toward the center of the galaxy under the effect of dynamical friction ( although it is debated if they survive the intense star formation they host and the associated feedback ",
    "@xcite ) , where they participate in building the bulge , thus providing another channel for bulge formation at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the picture becomes even more complex with the realization that local spiral galaxies host bulges with a whole range of morphologies .",
    "these are usually broken into two types , classical bulges and pseudo - bulges .",
    "classical bulges have a high srsic index ( meaning their mass distribution is highly concentrated ) and a spheroidal shape . a mechanism explaining their formation is the violent relaxation of stars during mergers , either major or frequent enough minor ones @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argue that clump coalescence in gas rich disks is actually similar to a merger in terms of orbit mixing and also produces classical bulges ( although see @xcite showing it might not be the case ) .    on the other hand , pseudo - bulges",
    "can be either flattened , with disk - like profile and kinematics or have a boxy - peanut shape ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "they are most likely the result of secular processes re - arranging disk material on timescales of a few billion years .",
    "bars are in particular thought to play a central part in pseudo - bulge formation since they trigger gas inflows , resulting in increased star formation in the central regions @xcite .",
    "as bars grow older , vertical instabilities can give them the boxy / peanut shape observed in many edge - on spirals @xcite .",
    "finally , minor mergers themselves are also a possible mechanism for triggering gas inflows and producing bulges with a low srsic index @xcite .    in the local universe , pseudo - bulges",
    "are mostly found in late - type galaxies , especially in isolated environments @xcite .",
    "the milky - way itself hosts a pseudo - bulge , with the contribution of a classical bulge limited to 8% of the total stellar mass @xcite .",
    "even more stricking is the fact that 80% of local galaxies (",
    "i.e. within the local 11 mpc sphere ) more massive than 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 are either bulgeless or only have a pseudo - bulge ( @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the widespread existence of galaxies without a classical bulge is extremely puzzling given the variety of mechanisms expected to produce them , and the frequency of these mechanisms in our standard cosmological model .",
    "the formation of realistic spiral galaxies has indeed been a major challenge for cosmological simulations in the last 20 years .",
    "early simulations suffered from extreme angular momentum loss during mergers , giving birth to galaxies with overly concentrated mass distributions and massive bulges ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the increased resolution of recent simulations , as well as the inclusion of additional physics , in particular feedback from supernovae , has considerably improved the situation @xcite .",
    "zoom cosmological simulations can now produce milky - way mass galaxies with a bulge fraction of 0.20.3 @xcite , closer to that observed in our own galaxy . in such simulations ,",
    "the formation of galaxies with a small bulge relies on the use of a low star formation efficiency , a high threshold for star formation and/or gas recycling with galactic fountains .",
    "although no clear consensus has been reached on how to model star formation and feedback , a picture emerges in which more disk - dominated galaxies form if their star formation histories are delayed significantly by the chosen subgrid recipe @xcite .",
    "however , no simulation has ever been able to produce a milky - way mass bulgeless galaxy ( note that this problem is partially solved for dwarf galaxies , where supernova feedback is much more efficient at removing baryons with a low angular momentum ",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , the intrinsic limitations of zoom simulations make it hard for them to study galaxy formation from a statistical point of view . in this type of simulations , a given sub - volume of the box",
    "is simulated at high resolution , while the rest of the box is kept at a very coarse resolution .",
    "the high - resolution sub - volume is centered on the galaxy that is being studied , and this volume needs to encompass all particles ending - up in the galaxy at @xmath0 .",
    "this can lead to a very complex , and possibly large , zoom volume , often making the technique highly inefficient , so that not all galaxies can be simulated this way .",
    "it is in particular difficult to simulate galaxies with high accretion and merger rates at all redshifts , although more isolated galaxies or massive galaxies with early assemblies are more easily modeled .    in any case , gathering a larger sample of such simulations is a challenge given today s supercomputers",
    "hence , it has been difficult to test the formation of galaxies of different hubble types ( at fixed physical recipes ) , to link their morphology with their history or to study the connection between high reshift galaxy populations and their @xmath0 counterparts .    in this paper",
    "we present a suite of 33 simulations performed with an alternative zoom re - simulation technique ( presented in @xcite ) .",
    "this technique consists of extracting the merger and gas accretion histories of dark matter haloes in a large - scale cosmological simulation and then re - simulating these histories at much higher resolution .",
    "its main advantage is its low computational cost that makes it possible to gather a large sample of simulated galaxies and to follow their evolution from @xmath11 to @xmath0 .",
    "the simulated sample is made of 33 isolated galaxies with a halo mass between @xmath12 and @xmath13 m@xmath10 . at @xmath0",
    ", we find galaxies with a large range of hubble types , from bulgeless to bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "most of the galaxies host pseudo - bulges , with a srsic index lower than 2 .",
    "we study the evolution of their morphology with redshift .",
    "we do not find any correlation between the morphology at @xmath2 and at @xmath0 , with a whole range of possibilities for the @xmath2 progenitors of spiral galaxies ( interacting galaxies , bulge - dominated systems , pure disks , unstable disks ... ) .",
    "by contrast , there is a much better morphological correlation between @xmath14 and 0 , with spiral arms and bars being mostly in place at @xmath14 .",
    "focussing on the formation histories of galaxies with b / t@xmath4 ( typically sb and later types , and corresponding to 16 galaxies of our sample ) , we find that the most disk - dominated of these galaxies have both an extremely quiet merger and gas accretion history .",
    "by contrast , more violent merger or gas accretion histories give birth to galaxies with more prominent bulges .",
    "we find that the galaxies with the highest bulge srsic index at @xmath0 are not those with mergers but those with intense gas accretion at @xmath2 and either early bar formation or other disk instabilities .",
    "in section 2 we describe the simulation technique and discuss the selection of the sample . in section 3",
    "we present the techniques we used to perform morphological decompositions , while in section 4 we discuss the general properties of the sample at @xmath0 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the high redshift progenitors of spiral galaxies , where we present the evolution of their mass , star formation rate , size and morphology with redshift .",
    "finally , section 6 is focused on our most disk - dominated galaxies ( with a bulge fraction lower than 0.3 ) and characterizes their merger and gas accretion histories .",
    "we study the evolution of 33 simulated galaxies from @xmath11 to @xmath0 using the zoom - in technique described in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "this technique consists of extracting merger and accretion histories ( and geometry ) for a given halo in a @xmath8-cdm cosmological simulation , and then re - simulating these histories at much higher resolution , replacing each halo by a realistic galaxy containing gas , stars and dark matter .    in this section",
    ", we will briefly recall the main details of the simulation technique , present the characteristics of the model galaxies , and explain how the sample of 33 re - simulated galaxies was chosen .",

    "the dark matter halos are detected in the cosmological simulation using the hop algorithm @xcite .",
    "particles that do not belong to a gravitationally bound halo are also taken into account ; we will refer to them as `` diffuse '' mass accretion when they are accreted by the studied halo .",
    "we extract the merger and diffuse accretion histories of a halo by tracking halos and particles crossing a fixed spherical boundary drawn around the target halo .",
    "we record the position , velocity and spin of each incoming satellite as well as the date of the interaction .",
    "we then perform a new simulation , in which we now replace each halo of the cosmological simulation by a galaxy made up of gas , star and dark matter particles , and each diffuse particle of the cosmological simulation with a blob of lower - mass , higher - resolution gas and dark matter particles ( see a detailed explanation of how this is done in appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "they start interacting with the main galaxy following the orbital and spin parameters given by the cosmological simulation .",
    "the re - simulation starts at @xmath11 inside a 800  kpc - large zoom area , and follows the evolution of the main galaxy down to @xmath0 .",

    "a we present a resolution test , with the spatial and mass resolutions higher by a factor of two and six respectively .",
    "we find very little difference between the high - resolution and standard runs .",
    "gas dynamics is modeled with a sticky - particle scheme ( with a similar resolution of 150  pc ) and star formation is computed with a schmidt - kennicutt law @xcite with an exponent of 1.5 and an efficiency of 2% . the threshold for star formation",
    "is set at 0.03 m@xmath18pc@xmath26 ( i.e. one atom per cubic centimeter ) , which corresponds to the minimal density for diffuse atomic cloud formation @xcite .",
    "we include the energy feedback from supernovae explosions , and use a kinetic feedback scheme : 20% of the energy of the supernovae is distributed to neighbouring gas particles ( within a radius of 70 pc ) in the form of a radial velocity kick .",
    "we also include the continuous gas return from high- , intermediate- and low - mass stars following the scheme proposed by @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "we indeed found stellar mass loss to be an important ingredient for the formation of realistic late - type galaxies in cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "each halo recorded in the dark matter - only cosmological simulation is replaced with a realistic galaxy , made of a disk ( gas and stars ) , a stellar bulge and a dark matter halo .",
    "the disks have a toomre profile , the bulge is a plummer sphere and the halo follows a burkert profile @xcite .",
    "the core radii of our dark matter halos are chosen according to the scaling relations proposed by @xcite and the halos are truncated at their virial radius .",
    "the stellar mass of a galaxy is set according to table 7 of @xcite as a function of its halo mass and of the redshift at which the galaxy is introduced in the simulation .",
    "all model galaxies are assumed to be disk galaxies without a bulge , except for massive galaxies ( m@xmath27 ) at @xmath28 , in which case the mass of the bulge is set to 20% of the stellar mass .",
    "the gas content in the disk also varies according to redshift and total mass : at @xmath28 , the gas fraction ( with respect to total baryonic mass ) is 0.3 for small galaxies ( @xmath29 ) and 0.15 for massive galaxies . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the gas fraction is chosen independently of the total mass , and is set to 0.5 for @xmath30 and 0.7 for @xmath31 .",
    "no hot gas halo is included , which should be a sensible approximation given that the mass of the model galaxies is always lower than the critical mass for virial shocks to be stable ( , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "the chosen galaxies sample the whole volume but avoid the densest regions .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the technique we developed was designed to overcome some of the limitations of standard zoom simulations .",
    "such a re - simulation technique has already been used by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to study the stability of a stellar disk undergoing a series of collisionless minor mergers . a major difference with our work",
    "is that these simulations include no gas component ( and consider mergers only above a given mass ratio ) so that their scope is limited and they can not be used to study most mechanisms governing galaxy evolution .",
    "the main advantage of the re - simulation technique is the low computation time compared to zoom cosmological simulations , so that running a large number of simulations is easier and statistical studies are possible .",
    "another advantage is that it is possible to simulate galaxies with all types of merger histories , in contrast to zoom simulations that need all the progenitors to be in the sub - volume treated at high resolution .",
    "some merger histories are thus for now impossible to simulate with a standard zoom technique , in particular if they involve a merger at @xmath32 with a massive galaxy , in which case the sub - volume on which one has to zoom becomes very large . finally , the fact that we decouple the evolution of our main galaxy from the expansion of the universe keeps the physical resolution constant as a function of time at no additional cost ( all positions are expressed in physical units rather than in comoving units ) .",
    "this is not necessarily the case in cosmological simulations , that often have a constant resolution in comoving coordinates , so that the physical resolution decreases with redshift unless ( in the case of amr simulations ) additional levels of refinement are added , with a large computational cost .        , or formation redshift ) as a function of their stellar mass at @xmath0 .",
    "the formation redshift of most galaxies is between 0.5 and 1 , suggesting a late assembly of their stellar content.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    of course there are also some major drawbacks .",
    "the most important is probably the large number of free parameters for the model galaxies .",
    "even if we carefully select these parameter to be close to the observed galaxies , we will never reach the level of diversity found both in observations and in fully cosmological simulations .",
    "the case of our @xmath33 galaxies is even more complicated , with very few data both from observations and previous simulations .",
    "however , at @xmath11 only a minor fraction of the final baryonic mass of a simulated galaxy is already in place : on average , we find that only 5% of the @xmath34 baryons are in place at @xmath11 .",
    "the mergers and instabilities happening between @xmath11 and @xmath34 redistribute these initial baryons , so that the initial assumptions do not make a big difference for our purpose here ( see a test of a change of initial conditions in appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "we are thus careful to `` discard '' the early phase of the simulations and only analyse them after @xmath34 to erase the memory of the initial conditions .",
    "finally , an important limitation is linked with the sticky - particle model , that poorly treats the hot gas phase ( see also the discussion in appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "this technique is thus unable to treat the case of massive halos ( above the critical mass of @xmath35  m@xmath18 for virial shocks to be stable ) , for instance massive early - type galaxies , but also groups and clusters .",
    "we are limited to galaxies below the threshold for virial shocks , for which we know the cold accretion mode is predominant . in that case , the feeding of cold gas to the galaxy is most easily tied to the properties of the cosmic - web filaments to which the galaxy is connected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we select 33 halos with a mass between @xmath12 and @xmath13 m@xmath10 and that are relatively isolated at @xmath0 : no halo more massive than half of their mass can be found within 2 mpc , and they are at least 6 mpc away from one of the four most massive halos in the simulation box .",
    "the chosen halos are distributed across the whole volume of the simulation box but avoid the densest regions ( see figure [ fig : loc_halos ] ) .",
    "we computed the local density contrast at @xmath0 in spheres of radius 8 mpc around each halo , @xmath36 , and find values ranging from -0.29 to -0.01 , with all but 5 galaxies in the range [ -0.29,-0.22 ] .",
    "this confirms that the simulated galaxies are in underdense environments , with densities intermediate between the local group and the center of voids @xcite .",
    "no additional criterion is set , in particular there is no constraint on the merger history of the chosen halos .",
    "the chosen halos represent 26% of the total number of halos in the simulation box within this mass range , and 69% of the halos satisfying both the mass and environment criteria .",
    "note that in the mass range that we are considering the abundance and internal properties of halos are unaffected by the relatively small box size of the cosmological simulation @xcite .",
    "appendix [ app : sample ] shows for each simulated galaxy several i - band surface brightness maps ( computed using pegase , with a kroupa imf , and without dust extinction ) at various redshifts , the i - band surface brightness profile at @xmath0 as well as the stellar mass evolution with time .",
    "the mass growth histories are usually very quiet for these galaxies , resulting in a disk+bulge ( and possibly bar ) morphology for all of them .",
    "figure [ fig : examples_z0 ] shows examples of i - band images and stellar mass evolution plots for two extreme cases : a disk - dominated galaxy ( left panels ) with an extremely quiet history , and a bulge - dominated one that has undergone several mergers at @xmath28 .",
    "we find that at @xmath34 the simulated galaxies have at most reached 20% of their final stellar mass , at @xmath2 they have typically between 30 and 60 % of their final mass , and between 50 and 80% for @xmath14 .",
    "the redshift at which half of the final stellar mass is in place ( @xmath37 ) is shown in figure [ fig : z_half ] . while @xmath37 is greater than 1 for 22% of the simulated galaxies , the majority ( 69% ) of galaxies reach half of their final stellar mass between @xmath2 and @xmath0.5 .",
    "these results suggest a late assembly of our sample galaxies .",
    "we find one extreme case of a galaxy with only 0.001% of its mass in place at @xmath34 , and 4% at @xmath2 ; this is a galaxy undergoing several major mergers after @xmath2 and having a bulge - dominated morphology at @xmath0 ( this is the galaxy shown on the right in figure [ fig : examples_z0 ] ) .",
    "we use two different methods to characterize the morphology of the simulated galaxies .",
    "one of them is based on stellar kinematics .",
    "it is usually robust but fails at discriminating bars and bulges .",
    "the other technique consists in using galfit @xcite to fit mock images of the galaxies with a sum of bulge , bar and disk profiles .",
    "this technique is less robust , especially for galaxies that are difficult to fit with smooth profiles , which is often the case at high redshift and which is the reason why we will only use this technique for the galaxies at @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", galfit has the advantage of giving measures that are easy to compare to observations .",
    "it also allows us to discriminate bars and bulges , and to measure their srsic index .",
    "a detailed comparison of the relative advantages and limitations of the two techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "we set the z - axis to the direction of the total angular momentum of all stars within the optical radius ( r@xmath38 in g band ) .",
    "we compute the circularity parameter @xmath39 for each of the stellar particles within the optical radius , where @xmath40 is the angular momentum a particle would have if it were on a circular orbit at its current radius . in a standard spiral galaxy ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath41 shows two peaks , one at @xmath42 corresponding to the rotating disk component , and one at @xmath43 corresponding to the non - rotating spheroidal component ( see panel a in figure [ fig : eps ] ) .",
    "we identify the spheroidal component by assuming it corresponds to a distribution of @xmath41 symmetric around @xmath44 so that its mass is @xmath45 .",
    "note that in some cases , particularly if the galaxy hosts a bar , @xmath44 is not 0 , but most often between 0.2 and 0.4 , which means the central regions of the galaxy have a net rotation movement ( see panel b in figure [ fig : eps ] ) .",
    "in some cases however , @xmath44 can be difficult to measure if the two peaks are not clearly separated ( see panels c and d in figure [ fig : eps ] ) .",
    "in this situation , we either set @xmath44 to the value corresponding to the peak of the distribution of @xmath41 restricted to stars within the central inner 2 kpc of the galaxy ( see panel c ) , or if this does not help @xmath44 is set to 0 ( see panel d ) .",
    "we create i - band images of the @xmath0 galaxies , extending out to 1.5 times the optical radius .",
    "we mask out of the image satellite galaxies as well as any bright clump that would make the identification of the main components more difficult .",
    "we use galfit in two steps : first we try a bulge+disk model and then a bulge+bar+disk model ( see some examples of decompositions in figure [ fig : galfit_examples ] ) .",
    "bulges and bars are assumed to follow a srsic profile while disks are assumed to have an exponential profile . in a bulge+bar+disk decomposition , the bar is chosen to be the srsic component with the lowest srsic index , largest effective radius and smallest axis ratio .    between a bulge+disk and a bulge+bar+disk decomposition , @xmath46 is often not sufficiently different to clearly identify the best model . in this case",
    "we add two additional criteria : the amplitude of the residuals both in the 2d image and in the radial profile .",
    "we then set the total bulge and/or bar luminosity to the corresponding srsic fits .",
    "as far as the disk is concerned , taking the luminosity of the smooth exponential profile is not always relevant , especially in the case of rings or lopsided features .",
    "we then measure the disk luminosity by subtracting the bulge and/or bar profiles to the total light distribution .",
    "note that 5 galaxies present such a complex structure that no satisfying galfit decomposition can be achieved , we remove them from studies involving photometric decompositions .",
    "figure [ fig : compar_morpho ] compares the disk - to - total ( d / t ) ratio obtained for each galaxy with the kinematic and photometric techniques .",
    "there does not seem to be any strong systematic offset between the values obtained by the two methods , although the scatter is quite large . for galaxies without a bar",
    "however , we find that galfit tends to give higher values of d / t compared with the kinematic decomposition .",
    "this trend was also found by @xcite .",
    "they argue that the most likely reason for this difference is the fact that the photometric technique assumes that the disk exponential profile extends all the way to the center of the galaxy , while the stars in the center most likely are dispersion - dominated and are instead attributed to the bulge component by the kinematic decomposition .",
    "additional differences can be attributed to measuring the morphology from the mass distribution instead of the luminosity distribution .",
    "the fact that there is no systematic offset between the disk fraction obtained by the two methods suggests however that the `` spheroid '' component identified kinematically roughly corresponds to the bulge and bar components identified by galfit .",
    "we study the global properties of our simulated galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we use in this section the photometric measurements to facilitate comparisons with observations , especially with @xcite , who studied a sample of local massive spirals with a galfit decomposition technique similar to the one adopted here .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : histo_bulge ] the cumulative distribution of the bulge - to - total ratio as measured with galfit    the simulated galaxies span a large range of bulge fractions , from nearly bulgeless galaxies with b / t of the order of 0.05 to bulge - dominated galaxies with b / t close to 0.8 .",
    "however , the distribution of the bulge fractions differs significantly from the observed one : b / t tends to be too high in the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : histo_bulge ] shows that only 32% of our simulated galaxies have b / t@xmath47 , a value much lower than the 66% found by @xcite .",
    "similarly , 40% of the observed sample is found at b / t@xmath48 , a value that is only reached by 14% of our sample ( these nearly bulgeless galaxies are shown in figure [ fig : appa1 ] ) . in spite of the success of the simulations at producing galaxies with small bulges",
    ", there is thus strong evidence that not enough simulated galaxies are produced with a low b / t .",
    "although the images used by @xcite are in h - band while ours are in i - band and we do not include dust extinction , and while these differences will affect the measured bulge fractions @xcite , this is probably not enough to reconcile the simulations with the observations .",
    "in addition , even if we probe similar stellar mass ranges , our simulated galaxies are likely more isolated than the observed sample , that is only magnitude - limited , with no restriction on environment . however",
    ", if we compare the simulations to samples of isolated galaxies , the discrepancy becomes even greater : the observed population of isolated galaxies is strongly dominated by late - type spirals @xcite .",
    "note also that we do not find any pure elliptical galaxies , but this is not so worrying since they are rather rare , especially in isolated environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite perform bulge / disk decompositions of sdss galaxies and also show that very few galaxies actually have bulge fractions greater than 0.8 .",
    "another difference with observations is that we do not find any correlation between stellar mass and bulge content ( figure [ fig : mstar_bulge ] ) , contrary for instance to @xcite that show a trend to higher bulge fractions with higher stellar masses",
    ". this difference might be insignificant due to our small sample and due to different methods used to measure stellar masses in observations and simulations ( @xcite estimate the stellar mass of a galaxy from its @xmath49 color , they estimate typical errors to be within a factor of 23 ) , but it could also reflect a more profound discrepancy between our simulations and observations .     is only 0.34 for our sample of simulations , vs a fraction of 0.66 for the sample of local massive spirals observed by @xcite .",
    "this is an important discrepancy , even if our sample is small and statistical comparisons are hard to perform . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]     for the simulated galaxies .",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    figure [ fig : sersic ] shows the bulge srsic index as a function of the bulge fraction .",
    "most of our simulated galaxies have a low srsic index , the majority lower than 2 , indicating a large fraction of pseudo - bulges within our sample .",
    "this is consistent with the observed properties of local disk galaxies ; @xcite find for instance that the srsic index of bulges is on average lower than 2 for all morphological types ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the bar content of our galaxies also appears roughly consistent with observations : 70% of our galaxies host a bar , to be compared to values of 6070% for local galaxies when observed in the near - infrared @xcite .",

    "our technique thus maximizes the impact of mergers , and we thus probably slightly overestimate bulge formation due to this process . however , many of the simulated galaxies have a quiet merger history , so that this effect alone is unlikely to account for the lack of bulgeless galaxies .",
    "this lack is possibly aggravated by the relatively low number of violently unstable disks at @xmath22 in the simulations , which could instead lead us to underestimate bulge formation .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath6425% of the simulated galaxies show a ring morphology at some point between @xmath2 and 2 .",
    "these rings correspond to m=0 instabilities , and in approximately half of the cases , the ring itself becomes unstable and fragments ( quite similarly to what is shown in figure [ fig : unstable_disk ] ) , leading to bulge formation . in some other cases however , the rings do not fragment but dissolve slowly , and we also find cases of disks remaining very smooth and stable . if the stability of these disks were artificial , we would then underestimate bulge formation , and the lack of bulgeless galaxies would become even more stricking",
    ".    these disks could be artificially too stable because of resolution effects . to test this",
    ", we have re - run one of the simulations at twice higher resolution ( see the results in appendix [ app : res ] ) . in the standard resolution run",
    ", the chosen galaxy has a ring which remains stable for several gyrs before slowly dissolving , leading to the formation of a bulgeless galaxy . at higher resolution",
    ", we find that the ring does not stay stable for such a long time , becomes unstable earlier , and a bulge grows more quickly .",
    "this gives birth however to only a very low mass bulge , with b / t @xmath64 0.02 .",
    "we also find that the surface density profiles are very similar in the standard and high resolution runs .",
    "it thus seems that resolution alone could not be enough to explain the stability of some disks in our simulations .",
    "while it could also be due to our gas dynamics scheme , this seems similarly unlikely since such a scheme has already been used successfully to model gas rich unstable disks ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is also probably not a consequence of our implementation of supernova feedback ( that could dissolve the clumps in some cases , see @xcite ) , because our feedback is rather weak . in turn , it might be linked with star formation , and with the overly rapid gas consumption that the galaxies seem to experience between @xmath34 and @xmath2 . at @xmath2 ,",
    "the simulated galaxies only have gas fractions of 0.200.40 , which might not be enough for strong instabilities to develop .",
    "a direct comparison with the observed fraction of clumpy high redshift disks is however hard to perform , particularly because of the different mass ranges explored .",
    "a large fraction of our galaxies are small at @xmath22 , and have low stellar masses and sfrs ( in the range 330 m@xmath65/yr ) , which would make them hard to observe at such high redshifts .",
    "in addition to forming galaxies with overly massive bulges , simulations also usually struggle to reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and halo mass .",
    "observationally , direct measures can be obtained from weak lensing @xcite or satellite kinematics @xcite .",
    "many recent studies have also used abundance matching , a more indirect technique where the observed stellar masses are associated with dark matter halos extracted from simulations by assuming that the most massive galaxies are assigned to the most massive ( sub)halos @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the various uncertainties associated with this technique , arising mostly from errors in the stellar masses ( mostly linked with stellar population modelling ) , with additional errors coming from the scatter in assigning galaxies to halos .",
    "overall , most techniques give similar results within a factor of 2 @xcite , with possible differences as a function of galaxy hubble type and color @xcite , and with additional variations between central and satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that at fixed stellar mass spiral galaxies appear to be living in lower mass halos compared to ellipticals @xcite .",
    "@xcite also point out that the stellar masses of spirals could be underestimated by 10 to 50 % if the same stellar mass - to - light ratio is used for thin and thick disks , so that the stellar - to - halo mass ratio could be further decreased for these galaxies .",
    "however the stellar mass in simulations seems in most cases to be a few times too high ( see for instance the compilation presented in @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations suffer from the same shortcoming : depending on the simulated galaxy , the fraction of the cosmic baryons found in stars ( i.e. , the galaxy formation efficiency ) varies between 0.38 and 0.88 , with an average of 0.62 .",
    "this is 3 times higher than the observed fraction of @xmath66 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observational uncertainties probably can not account for such a discrepancy .",
    "note however that the agreement between simulations and observations is usually improved when the stellar masses are measured in the simulations in the same way as observers do , i.e. when stellar masses are estimated from the spectral energy distribution of the simulated galaxies @xcite .",
    "overly high stellar masses could be due to the way we take the cosmic accretion of baryons into account , and could happen if gas accretion were overestimated .",
    "indeed , our simulation technique assumes that filaments contain the cosmic fraction of baryons , which might not be true , and one of the consequences of the sticky particle scheme is that we ignore hot halos and assume all gas is accreted cold .",
    "if less cold gas reached the galactic disk , this would help decrease the stellar content of the simulated galaxies .",
    "however , the galaxy formation efficiencies that we find are extremely similar to what simulations using other gas modelling techniques find ( e.g. with amr , @xcite , or with sph , @xcite , see also a comparison of different codes in @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy suggest a much deeper issue , found in most simulations , whatever the technique used .",
    "an exception has recently been published by @xcite , whose disk galaxy does sit on the observed stellar - to - halo mass relation .",
    "however , they use a way of deriving stellar mass slightly different from what other simulations have used , and neglect metal - dependent cooling at high temperatures , thus probably maximizing the effect of supernovae .",
    "they argue that their success is due to a high star formation threshold , which they set at 5 atoms cm@xmath26 ( this is 5 times higher than the threshold we use but it s unsure if this could be enough to cause the differences between the simulations ) .",
    "they present only one case however , and it would be interesting to see if their recipes also produce realistic galaxies over a wider range of masses and formation histories . regardless , a high star formation threshold is probably not a universal solution by itself , since @xcite used a similarly high value but still find it hard to match the observed stellar to halo mass relation .",
    "the fact that simulations struggle to reproduce the stellar masses and bulge fractions of observed galaxies suggests some deep issues with the current recipes used to model the physics of baryons .",
    "agn feedback is probably not relevant for our study , given the halo mass range on which we focus , and given that black holes are probably not massive enough in late - type galaxies . in turn ,",
    "star formation and supernova feedback parameters likely play a much more important role .",
    "while we already mentioned possible effects of the chosen star formation threshold , the star formation efficiency itself strongly impacts the morphology of the simulated galaxies @xcite .",
    "calibrating this efficiency is difficult , especially since it could vary with redshift ( as suggested by @xcite ) , which would be the case if it depended on metallicity ( @xcite showed that taking into account the influence of metallicity suppresses star formation , especially in small galaxies at high redshift ) .",
    "this calibration requires simulations at much higher resolution than what can currently be achieved in cosmological context , following the structure of the gmcs and capturing supersonic turbulence .",
    "such simulations have indeed produced results differing significantly from lower resolution ones , showing for instance an increased star formation efficiency during mergers @xcite , or a different structure for the merger remnants @xcite .",
    "supernova feedback has been shown to be a key ingredient to produce realistic galaxies @xcite .",
    "supernova - driven winds can not escape the gravitational potential of massive galaxies , which makes them inefficient at directly reducing the baryon fraction in milky - way type galaxies at low redshift .",
    "however , some authors argue that the winds and galactic fountains are essential for redistributing angular momentum and producing bulgeless galaxies , all the more so since most of the ejected material has a low angular momentum @xcite .",
    "it seems unlikely that a stronger feedback would be the solution to the issues we encountered in our simulations , both because of the relatively low sfr , even at high redshift , in which case outflows are not very powerful , and because a significant fraction of the mass growth of the simulated galaxies happens at relatively low redshift ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition to these standard physical prescriptions , it could also be that current simulations are missing key physical ingredients like radiative transfer .",
    "indeed , while radiation is usually thought to play an important role in regulating the fraction of baryons in low mass galaxies at high redshift ( see for instance the recent simulations by @xcite ) , it might also be important at lower redshifts and in massive galaxies .",
    "for instance , @xcite argues that the cooling in a galactic halo can be regulated by the photoionizing radiation from the galaxy itself that would remove the main coolants from the hot gas , so that the cooling timescale would directly depend on the sfr of the host galaxy . this could be an efficient mechanism for regulating gas cooling and galaxy formation .",
    "observations have revealed significant differences between galaxy populations at high redshift and the @xmath0 hubble sequence .    already at @xmath68 grand - design spirals",
    "are rare and the spiral structure of disk galaxies is often more chaotic @xcite .",
    "disk galaxies are still however observed up to @xmath69 , and at fixed stellar mass their size seems to undergo little change between @xmath2 and 0 @xcite .",
    "large blue disks have also been found at @xmath34 ( some with spiral arms ) , but these object are extremely rare , and probably correspond only to the most massive galaxies at that redshift @xcite .",
    "irregular and interacting galaxies become increasingly common with increasing redshift , with the population of such galaxies already significant at @xmath68 . in the hubble deep field ,",
    "@xcite find a fraction of irregular galaxies of 40 % , ten times more than in the local universe . in the udf @xcite",
    "find only 31% of spirals and 13% of ellipticals , the other galaxies being classified as chains , doubles , tadpoles or clump clusters .",
    "while most of these disturbed galaxies are probably disks ( undergoing a phase of violent instabilities ) , they could not fit anywhere on the standard @xmath0 hubble sequence .",
    "most surveys conclude that the hubble sequence disappears at @xmath702 , and most galaxies at that redshift seem to be irregular or compact @xcite .",
    "our simulations support this picture . at @xmath34 ,",
    "the majority of our simulated galaxies have a stellar mass between @xmath71 and @xmath72 m@xmath10 .",
    "none of these galaxies has a spiral - like morphology : some have very thick disks , some are ellipticals and there is a large fraction of galaxies undergoing interactions .",
    "their kinematics classifies them as dispersion - dominated systems and no clear hubble sequence could be defined .",
    "this may be a consequence of the mass range we explore , and is consistent with observations showing that more massive galaxies are less irregular ( with for instance some cases of massive spirals as observed at @xmath73 by @xcite ) .",
    "by @xmath2 , a number of our simulated galaxies have acquired a more standard spiral morphology , with a few cases of galaxies with spiral arms , and some with a bar .",
    "the majority of disks however show no signs of either a bar or spiral arms .",
    "most galaxies contain several distinct dynamical components , with in some cases bulges and disks that can be separated from their kinematics .",
    "by @xmath14 bars are much more common and the final structure is more or less in place even if spiral arms often appear fragmented . between @xmath14 and @xmath0 , spiral arms become better defined and bars continue their growth .",
    "note that our simulations suggest bars to be long lived structures , which will be investigated in more detail in a future paper .",
    "we thus confirm that a sequence of disks and ellipticals is found at @xmath2 , but we find no one - to - one correspondence with @xmath0 .",
    "most galaxies in our sample acquire their final morphology at @xmath68 ( or even later if the details of bars and spiral arms are taken into account ) .",
    "we notice that the most disk - dominated galaxies of our sample share extremely quiet merger histories , with only very minor mergers after @xmath34 . while this could seem quite obvious",
    ", it also contradicts recent claims that mergers could actually help disk survival by triggering central starbursts and subsequent strong outflows of low angular momentum material @xcite .",
    "our simulated galaxies show however that galaxies with a major merger at @xmath22 can end up at @xmath0 with a relatively low bulge fraction of 0.150.3 .",
    "in fact , we find that 6 out of 16 ( i.e. 37% ) of simulated galaxies with b / t@xmath4 have a major merger between @xmath34 and @xmath2 .",
    "this fraction is significantly higher than the values quoted in @xcite , where the different models tested conclude that less than 10% of galaxies with such a bulge fraction have a major merger at @xmath74 , which is a very strong constraint .",
    "our simulations give much weaker constraints on the merger histories of spiral galaxies , provided that major mergers happen at @xmath6 .",
    "this result is a combination of some mergers having disky remnants ( all of them have a srsic index lower than 2 ) and of a significant amount of disk growth after @xmath2 .",
    "this significant disk growth at low redshift both comes from the accretion of fresh gas ( although galaxies with mergers tend to accrete gas at relatively low rates see middle panel in figure [ fig : rate_accretion ] ) and from gas recycling due to stellar mass loss @xcite .",
    "regarding mergers and bulge formation , merger remnants can be significantly affected by the simulation resolution : @xcite show that a resolution of @xmath75  pc ( compared to our resolution of 150 pc ) is required to follow the evacuation of angular momentum necessary for the formation of slow rotators , and that the effect is even stronger for mergers of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "@xcite also showed that simulations resolving the turbulent and fragmented nature of the ism produced merger remnants that were more compact and with higher srsic indices .",
    "the low srsic indices of the bulges formed in our simulations could thus be a consequence of their limited resolution .",
    "independent to the detailed properties of the bulges , we find mergers to make a significant contribution to bulge formation at high redshift , all the more so since violent disk instabilities are relatively rare in our simulations . whether this is realistic or not can be tested with studies of thick disks .",
    "both the mass , shape and kinematics of thick disks are indeed tracers of their formation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the fact that the edges of thick disks are not flared ( see for instance @xcite ) was used by @xcite to show that they most likely did not form because of minor mergers , but rather are the relics of gas - rich clumpy disks at high redshift .",
    "a future paper will be dedicated to thick disks in our simulations , and if they are flared , this would indicate that we probably overestimate the importance of mergers for bulge formation at high redshift .",
    "we present the results of a series of cosmological simulations targetting 33 galaxies in an isolated environment with halo masses between @xmath12 and @xmath13 m@xmath10 .",
    "we study the evolution from @xmath34 to @xmath0 of their morphology with techniques based both on their kinematics and on 2d decomposition with galfit .",
    "we find at @xmath0 galaxies with a large range of hubble types , from bulgeless disks to bulge - dominated galaxies , although the fraction of bulgeless galaxies may be lower than the observed fraction .",
    "most of the galaxies host pseudo - bulges , with a srsic index lower than 2 , and 70% of them have a bar .    at @xmath34 ,",
    "the simulated galaxies are very perturbed , and if there is a disk , it is usually thick , and sometimes unstable and clumpy .",
    "by contrast , it is much easier to identify disks and spheroids at @xmath2 , even if spiral structure is usually absent , and bars are rare ( except for galaxies with very high gas accretion rates at early times , in which case a bar can already have formed by @xmath2 ) .",
    "we find that spiral arms and bars are usually in place and are much more common by @xmath14 .",
    "even if a hubble sequence could be defined at @xmath2 , we do not find any correlation between the morphology at @xmath2 and at @xmath0 , with a whole range of possibilities for the @xmath2 progenitors of spiral galaxies ( interacting galaxies , bulge - dominated systems , pure disks , unstable disks ... ) .",
    "there is a much better morphological correlation between @xmath14 and 0 .",
    "focussing on the formation histories of galaxies with b / t@xmath4 ( typically sb and later types , and corresponding to about half the galaxies in our sample ) , we find a correlation between the bulge fraction at @xmath0 and the merger history , both in terms of the mass ratio of the largest merger undergone after @xmath34 and in terms of the fraction of baryons brought in by major and intermediate mergers .",
    "we also find a correlation with the gas accretion rate at @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the most disk - dominated of these galaxies both have an extremely quiet merger history ( with in most cases only minor mergers after @xmath34 ) and an extremely quiet gas accretion history : they accrete their gas at a low and constant rate , with an angular momentum vector always in the same direction .",
    "by contrast , more violent merger or gas accretion histories give birth to galaxies with more prominent bulges .",
    "interestingly , @xmath76% of the galaxies with b / t@xmath4 undergo a major merger between @xmath34 and @xmath2 ( none of these galaxies has a major merger at @xmath28 ) .",
    "their disk - dominated nature at @xmath0 is the consequence of both the relatively disky nature of the merger remnants and a significant disk growth at @xmath28 .",
    "finally , we find that the galaxies with the highest bulge srsic index at @xmath0 are not those with many mergers but those with intense gas accretion at @xmath2 and either early bar formation or other disk instabilities .",
    "the relation between old bars and high srsic index bulges will be investigated in a future paper , but it seems consistent with observations of local sb - sc galaxies by @xcite showing that most galaxies with a bulge srsic index greater than 1.7 also have a bar .    while our simulations are successful in producing galaxies with a large range of hubble types , and even a few nearly bulgeless galaxies , we still find that we probably overestimate bulge formation as well as the stellar mass at fixed halo mass .",
    "these issues , that are common to many cosmological simulations , are very likely related to the modelling of the physics of baryons .",
    "a better calibration of the efficiency of star formation ( with a possible dependency on metallicity , see @xcite ) , and a better treatment of stellar feedback ( from supernovae explosions but also for instance the radiation pressure from young massive stars ) are promising paths to follow in order to resolve these issues",
    ". in particular , the formation of disk - dominated galaxies seems to be easier in simulations where star formation is significantly delayed @xcite .",
    "this effect should be convolved with our study to get a complete picture on how galaxies get their morphology .",
    "we thank the referee for valuable comments and mark sargent for useful discussions .",
    "mm and dc acknowledge funding from a qeii fellowship awarded by the australian government . this work has been partly supported by isf grant 6/08 , by gif grant g-1052 - 104.7/2009 , and by a dip grant .",
    "simulations were carried out at cea / ccrt computing center .",
    "at high redshift , a number of our simulated galaxies show disks that remain extremely smooth , with some cases of rings that do not fragment .",
    "rings could be a frequent evolutionary stage in high redshift galaxies @xcite , but they are usually thought to fragment into clumps , that can then migrate to the center and form a bulge . since we are interested in bulge formation , it is particularly important to make sure that our disks are not kept artificially too stable , in which case we would strongly underestimate the bulge content of our galaxies .",
    "the non - fragmentation of our rings is probably not an artifact of the sticky - particle technique , which has already been successfully used to model gravitationally unstable disks ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it could however be due to the limited resolution of our simulations . to test this",
    ", we have re - run one of the simulations with a twice higher spatial resolution ( corresponding to 65 pc ) , and a mass resolution increased by a factor of 6 ( the mass of a gas particle is then 2500 m@xmath10 ) .",
    "we compare the structure of the simulated galaxy in the standard run and in the high resolution run .",
    "figure [ compar_resolution ] shows that in both cases a stellar ring forms at high redshift .",
    "this ring is more unstable at higher resolution , it dissolves more quickly and a bulge is formed earlier .",
    "however , if the details of the time evolution are different , the final galaxies are very similar at both resolutions . at t=10.2 gyr ,",
    "both galaxies have acquired a spiral structure , they have similar radii and stellar masses : the total stellar mass within the inner 8 kpc is @xmath77 m@xmath10 in the standard run , and @xmath78 m@xmath10 at higher resolution .",
    "furthermore , the surface density profiles are very similar , with the only difference being that the low resolution galaxy is bulgeless , while a small bulge has formed at high resolution . the bulge fraction at high resolution is however only 0.02 .",
    "this test thus confirms that the stability of the rings can be an artifact of the resolution we standardly use .",
    "increasing the resolution however only leads to a minor increase of the bulge fraction , so that most of our results should still be valid .",
