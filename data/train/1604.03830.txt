    "in the last years the research on circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) has been extended to mesoscopic devices , e.g. , quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite , tunnel junctions  @xcite or dc - biased josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "the high sensitivity of the cavity field offers a powerful way to probe the electronic conductor in a non - invasive way  @xcite thus acting as an excellent tool to investigate correlated electronic systems such as majorana fermions  @xcite and kondo physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many interesting phenomena due to the interplay between electrons and photons have been demonstrated in this hybrid device : quadrature squeezing @xcite , spin - photon coupling @xcite , coupling between distant qds @xcite , and photon lasing @xcite .",
    "these demonstrations open a huge avenue of possibilities in quantum information processing and quantum state engineering  @xcite with mesoscopic devices coupled to transmission lines . also the photons emitted by a quantum conductor carry information on the dynamics of electrons  @xcite .",
    "they have been used to characterize the photonic side of the dynamical coulomb blockade effect ( dcb )  @xcite in which photons are radiated by inelastic electron scattering .",
    "even with the rapid progress on cqed with mesoscopic devices the physics of a quantum point contact ( qpc ) coupled to a superconductor microwave resonator has been practically unexplored .",
    "the qpc is a coherent conductor formed by two metallic gates on the top of a two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "a voltage applied on the gates creates a one - dimension constriction connecting the two sides of the electron gas .",
    "the gate voltage controls both number of channels @xmath2 connecting the two metallic reservoirs and their transmission probabilities @xmath3 . as microwave photons",
    "are created by the scattering of electrons tunneling from one reservoir to the other , the qpc is an excellent device to investigate photon statistics with controlled electron scattering . in the case of a coherent conductor qpc",
    "coupled to an open transmission line , it has been predicted that the photons emitted by the qpc present sub- or super - poissonian statistics , depending on the transmission probability and source - drain voltage  @xcite .",
    "however , for a microwave cavity exchanging photons with the qpc , less is known about photon statistics .",
    "the cases of a tunnel junction  @xcite and a quantum dot  @xcite have been investigated with a quantum master equation .    in this article",
    ", we discuss a dc - biased coherent qpc coupled to a microwave resonator formed with a transmission line cavity ( tlc ) .",
    "a single mode is considered in the cavity , with frequency @xmath4 , such that our model equivalently describes a lumped lc circuit coupled to the qpc .",
    "when the dc - bias @xmath5 is smaller than the cavity frequency @xmath6 in reduced units , electrons coherently traversing the qpc do not carry enough energy to emit photons to the cavity and the cavity remains in the vacuum state at zero temperature . despite this absence of photons ,",
    "vacuum fluctuations in the cavity still affect and suppress electron tunneling with frank - condon factors  @xcite .",
    "this suppression is alternatively captured by the equilibrium @xmath1 theory  @xcite of the dcb @xcite .    for @xmath7 ,",
    "the electrons scattered by the qpc emit and absorb photons to / from the cavity .",
    "we want to characterize the distribution of photons by studying the mean number of photon , the damping rate of the cavity and the second - order coherence @xmath8 at vanishing time . for a weak electron - photon ( e - p ) coupling , the field radiated in an open transmission line exhibits  @xcite a negative - binomial form for the photon distribution , similar to blackbody radiation , approaching a poisson distribution with @xmath9 when the number of bosonic modes is infinite . in our case of a single - mode cavity",
    ", we consistently find a thermal distribution with @xmath10 as with other conductors  @xcite , independently of the transmission coefficients of the qpc .",
    "proceeding with the next - to - leading order at weak light - matter coupling , we obtain analytically a decrease in @xmath8 controlled by the bias voltage @xmath5 .",
    "this decrease is caused by a two - photon absorption process whereas two - photon emission is energetically forbidden for @xmath11 .",
    "the balance is reestablished at large bias where @xmath10 is recovered .",
    "interestingly , our next - to - leading order calculation can also be understood as a backaction effect . in the presence of electron transport accompanied by photon emission , the cavity reaches a non - equilibrium stationary state characterized by a bose - einstein photon distribution .",
    "this cavity state generates an out - of - equilibrium dcb affecting transport which in turn modifies the photon distribution .",
    "here we show that the conventional @xmath1 theory extended to the stationary state  @xcite recovers quantitatively the results of the straightforward perturbative calculation , revealing further the physics behind our analytical results .",
    "we also discuss the connections between different theoretical approaches to describe the coupled qpc - cavity system .",
    "we first consider a capacitive model initially devised in ref .   and",
    "included here in the keldysh path integral framework  @xcite . by inspecting the leading electron - photon order",
    ", we show its equivalence with a keldysh path integral method introduced by kindermann and nazarov  @xcite in which electronic variables have already been integrated out .",
    "we also apply a rate equation approach , obtained by neglecting off - diagonal elements in the quantum master equation , and show that it coincides with results from the path integral methods in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) . denoting @xmath12 the damping rate of the cavity",
    ", we focus below on the case @xmath13 where rwa is applicable , leaving aside the regime @xmath14 where the antibunching inherited from electrons plays a crucial role in the photon distribution  @xcite .",
