    "it has long been known that ro - vibrational line emission from molecular hydrogen , @xmath0 , is the dominant cooling process in gas of primordial composition at temperatures @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent work has made it clear that @xmath0 cooling also plays a key role in the evolution of low - density metal - poor gas @xcite . in primordial gas and in low density metal - poor gas , @xmath0 formation on dust is ineffective , and @xmath0 forms primarily through the gas - phase reactions @xcite @xmath4 with a smaller contribution coming from @xcite @xmath5 although only a small fractional abundance of @xmath0 , of order @xmath6 , is produced by these reactions , many authors have shown that this is more than sufficient to allow the gas to cool within a hubble time , and to allow star formation to occur ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once stars have formed , however , their radiation can interfere with the gas - phase production of @xmath0 .",
    "most of the attention devoted to the study of so - called `` radiative feedback '' has focused on the ultraviolet radiation from massive stars , which can suppress further star formation by photoionizing atomic and molecular hydrogen @xcite and by photodissociating @xmath0 @xcite , with the latter process able to operate at far greater distances from the star , owing to the low opacity of the gas at frequencies redwards of the lyman limit . on the other hand , radiative feedback due to the photodissociation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath7",
    "has attracted little direct study .",
    "one reason for this is the speed of reactions  [ r1 ] and [ r2 ] : both have rate coefficients @xmath8 , and so for reactions [ hmpd ] or [ h2ppd ] to be effective at suppressing @xmath0 formation , they must occur at a rapid rate .",
    "the other main reason for the comparative neglect of these processes is the nature of the radiation sources typically assumed in studies of radiative feedback .",
    "work to date has focused on feedback from massive stars or from agn .",
    "these sources are bright in the far - uv , and previous studies have found that feedback due to @xmath0 photodissociation by uv photons from these sources becomes effective long before feedback due to @xmath1 or @xmath2 photodissociation by optical or near - ir photons from the same sources ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    however , one issue that does not appear to have been previously considered in any great detail is that fact that once sources of ionization such as massive stars or agn exist , the ionized gas that they produce will act as a secondary source of radiation .",
    "radiative feedback due to the photodissociation of @xmath0 by lyman - werner band photons produced by recombining @xmath9 was considered by @xcite and found to be unimportant .",
    "however , radiative feedback due to the photodissociation of @xmath1 or @xmath2 by recombination emission or free - free emission from the ionized gas does not appear to have been considered prior to now .    in this paper ,",
    "i investigate this form of feedback and show that there are circumstances of cosmological importance in which it can be highly effective .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper involve a number of simplifications , so as to facilitate the exploration of a variety of different scenarios with minimal computational effort . nevertheless , they should produce results that are correct to within an order of magnitude , and so serve to highlight which scenarios require more detailed study .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ emiss ] , i outline the method used to compute the photodissociation rates produced by a given distribution of ionized gas . in  [ model ] , i use this method to investigate the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath2 photodissociation in the neutral gas surrounding an expanding region created by a population iii star (  [ expand ] ) , in a neutral cloud embedded in a large region (  [ embed ] ) and in the centre of a recombining ` fossil ' region (  [ fossil ] ) . finally",
    ", in  [ conclude ] i summarize what these results tell us about the scenarios in which @xmath1 and @xmath2 photodissociation is important .",
    "the radiation flux at a location @xmath10 produced by emission from an ionized volume v is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the optical depth at frequency @xmath13 between @xmath10 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the number density of electrons , @xmath16 is the number density of ions of species @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the emission coefficient for species @xmath17 ( with units @xmath19 ) , and where we sum over all ionic species present in the gas . for clarity , in the simplified examples presented in this paper ,",
    "i restrict my attention to emission from recombining @xmath20 ions . in normal circumstances",
    "this will produce the bulk of the emission , with a small additional contribution coming from helium , and with only negligible amounts of radiation coming from other ions .",
    "this simplification allows us to rewrite equation  [ emiss1 ] as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number density of @xmath20 ions and where @xmath23 is the emission coefficient for emission from @xmath20 .",
    "we can further simplify this equation by making the assumption that the temperature of the ionized gas is uniform . in this case",
    "@xmath24 becomes independent of position and can be moved outside the integral : @xmath25 a final simplification comes if we assume that the gas is optically thin . at the densities of interest in this work",
    ", this is a good approximation for most of the emission , as the continuum opacity of metal - free gas is very small @xcite .",
    "the exceptions are the bound - free emission produced by recombination directly into the @xmath26 ground state , and the lyman series lines . as i discuss at greater length in the next section",
    ", this emission can be taken into account by assuming that case b recombination applies .",
    "the assumption of optically thin gas allows us to rewrite equation  [ emiss3 ] as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 with these simplifications we have reduced the problem of computing the flux into two separate , simpler problems : that of computing @xmath24 and that of evaluating the integral @xmath29 . for a given distribution of ionized gas , numerical evaluation of the integral is trivial , and so the only real remaining difficulty is the evaluation of @xmath24 .",
    "i discuss this in the next section .        in my treatment of the effects of recombination",
    ", i assume that case b applies . in the classical case",
    "b , the gas is optically thick in both the lyman continuum and the lyman series lines . therefore , emission produced by recombination directly to the @xmath30 ground state will be immediately re - absorbed , with the result that only recombinations to excited states with @xmath31 actually result in a net decrease in the number of ionized hydrogen atoms .",
    "every recombination to a state with @xmath31 will be followed by a radiative cascade as the atom attempts to reach the ground state and some fraction of the photons produced during these cascades will be capable of photodissociating @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the photodissociation threshold of @xmath1 is 0.755  ev , and so @xmath1 can be photodissociated by any photons in the lyman series or balmer series , and by most photons in the paschen series ( starting with paschen-@xmath32 ) .",
    "@xmath2 , with its larger photodissociation threshold of 2.65  ev , can be dissociated by any lyman series photon , and by most balmer series photons ( starting with h@xmath33 ) , but is not affected by paschen series photons .    for the emissivities of the lines in the balmer and paschen series ,",
    "i use the values computed for case b by @xcite , who tabulate frequency - averaged emissivities for transitions from all excited states up to @xmath34 . as",
    "the widths of these emission lines are much smaller than the frequency range over which the photodissociation cross - sections of @xmath1 or @xmath2 vary substantially , accurate modelling of the line profiles is unnecessary and so for simplicity i model the lines as delta functions .    in case b ,",
    "all lyman series photons more energetic than lyman-@xmath35 are eventually degraded to lyman-@xmath35 photons plus one or more lower energy photons .",
    "while the results of @xcite include these lower energy photons , they do not account for the eventual fate of the lyman-@xmath35 photons . in the classical case",
    "b , these photons can never escape from the ionized region : the optical depth of the lyman series lines is assumed to be infinite .",
    "in reality , the optical depth is finite and some photons can escape from the gas , although generally not before they have scattered multiple times .",
    "there is also a small chance that an excited hydrogen atom in the @xmath36 state will reach the ground state not by direct radiative decay to the @xmath37 state , but rather by undergoing a collisional transition to the @xmath38 state , followed by two - photon decay to the ground state . over time",
    ", this process results in the net loss of a large number of lyman-@xmath35 photons from the ionized gas .",
    "the relative importance of these two processes depends upon a number of factors , such as the density of the region and the lyman-@xmath35 optical depth of the gas . for simplicity ,",
    "i consider in this paper only the limiting case in which two - photon decay dominates . in this case",
    ", the contribution to @xmath24 arising from two - photon emission can be written as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the frequency at line center of the lyman-@xmath35 line , @xmath41 is the case b recombination coefficient and @xmath42 is the normalized probability per two - photon decay of getting one photon in the interval @xmath43 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "i use the values tabulated by @xcite , while for @xmath44 i use a fitting function taken from @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 .      the contribution to @xmath24 from bound - free and free - free emission",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath47 \\label{bf+ff}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the gas temperature , @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the thermally averaged gaunt factor for free - free emission and @xmath51 is the gaunt factor for free - bound emission from recombination into level @xmath52 . the value of this expression has been tabulated as a function of frequency and temperature by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ tot_emiss ] , i plot the value of @xmath53 as a function of photon energy for photons with @xmath54 , assuming a gas temperature @xmath55 . in the same figure",
    ", i also plot the two - photon contribution @xmath56 . at low energies , close to the @xmath1 photodissociation threshold , the bound - free and free - free contributions dominate , while at high energies , the two - photon contribution dominates .",
    "it is also plain from the figure that if we were to disregard the two - photon emission , and to instead assume that all of the lyman-@xmath35 photons produced by the ionized gas eventually escape by scattering into the wings of the line , we would nevertheless obtain photodissociation rates for @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the same order of magnitude as those derived below .",
    "given @xmath57 , it is easy to compute the photodissociation rates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of the volume integral @xmath29 .",

    "table  [ tab : rates ] shows the relative size of the line and continuum contributions for three different gas temperatures : @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "two main points are worthy of note .",
    "firstly , there is an obvious temperature dependence : the hotter the region , the lower the photodissociative flux .",
    "secondly , line emission is far more important in the case of @xmath1 photodissociation that in the case of @xmath2 photodissociation . in the former case , line emission is the dominant contribution when the temperature of the ionized gas is small and is significant even when @xmath48 is large . in the latter case ,",
    "the contribution from line emission is always negligible .",
    "this difference is a consequence of the fact that the @xmath2 photodissociation cross - section is very small compared to the @xmath1 photodissociation cross - section at the energies which correspond to balmer series photons .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath2 photodissociation comes from photons with energies @xmath79 or above and hence in this case the continuum processes dominate .",
    "in order to establish whether or not the photodissociaton of @xmath1 and @xmath2 by emission from ionized hydrogen is ever an important process , i compute in this section the amount of flux produced in several scenarios of cosmological interest , along with the size of the resulting photodissociation rates . as my aim in this paper",
    "is simply to produce estimates of these values with the correct order of magnitude , the model regions considered here are all highly simplified compared to realistic systems .",
    "nevertheless , the results of these simple models should be a good guide as to whether more detailed numerical modelling is justified .",
    "the first simple scenario considered here involves emission from an expanding region within a small protogalactic halo .",
    "because the first stars to form in the universe are predicted to be very massive @xcite and therefore to be emitters of large numbers of ionizing photons @xcite , this scenario has been studied numerically by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "this work has given us a good understanding of the basic chain of events .",
    "the nascent region initially grows very rapidly , but recombinations in the dense gas surrounding the ionizing source quickly cause its growth to slow . after less than @xmath81 ( assuming a @xmath82 star ) , the ionization front bounding the region has become a slow , d - type front that drives a shock ahead of itself into the dense neutral gas . at radii greater than the shock radius @xmath83 ,",
    "the density profile of the gas remains almost the same as before the switch - on of the ionizing source . within the region , on the other hand , the density profile is flat , indicating that the density of the ionized gas is almost constant . at this point ,",
    "the evolution of the region is dominated by the pressure - driven expansion of the ionized gas : as the gas expands , the recombination rate falls , and so more ionizing photons become available for ionizing previous neutral gas , expanding the amount of mass contained in the region . if the density profile of the protogalactic gas is steep enough  it must fall off with radius more quickly than @xmath84 @xcite  and if the massive star shines for long enough , then eventually the ionization front will undergo a transition back to a supersonic r - type front , and will soon thereafter break out of the protogalaxy . however , even if the source switches off before break - out occurs , most of the ionized gas will nevertheless escape from the protogalaxy , as the mean outward radial velocity of this material is typically several times higher than the escape velocity of the halo .",
    "although the strong lyman - werner band emission from the massive star will quickly dissociate diffuse @xmath0 throughout much of the halo @xcite , the presence of abundant free electrons in the partially ionized region ahead of the ionization front can catalyze @xmath0 formation in this region , and @xcite have shown that the shielding provided by this @xmath0 can allow @xmath0 to survive in dense cores elsewhere in the protogalaxy .",
    "however , these calculations did not take into account the possible effects of recombination emission from the ionized gas .    to compute the emission from a typical protogalactic region , we assume , for simplicity",
    ", that it is spherically symmetric , with radius @xmath85 , and that the gas within it has a uniform density @xmath86 . inspection of the results from detailed three - dimensional numerical simulations of region growth in these protogalactic systems suggests that these should be reasonable approximations . in that case , the value of @xmath29 at a distance @xmath87 from the center of the region is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 \\ : { \\rm d}x ,   \\label{fx}\\ ] ] and where @xmath90 . in deriving this expression",
    "i have assumed that the gas is fully ionized , with @xmath91 .",
    "the value of @xmath92 is plotted in figure  [ intg_term ] as a function of @xmath93 . in the limit",
    "that @xmath94 , we see that @xmath95 , while for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and in the limit of large @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "if we assume that the temperature of the ionized gas is @xmath78 , then at a point just outside the region , the @xmath1 photodissociation rate is given by @xmath100 and the @xmath2 photodissociation rate is given by @xmath101 for comparison , the rate at which @xmath1 is destroyed by associative detachment ( reaction  [ r1 ] ) is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the number density of atomic hydrogen , and where we have adopted the rate coefficient determined for this reaction by @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the rate of this reaction is uncertain by almost an order of magnitude , but for the initial order - of - magnitude study given in this paper , the use of a value from close to the middle of the range of uncertainty is probably justified . the rate at which @xmath2 is destroyed by charge transfer ( reaction  [ r2 ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath104    in this particular example , the density of atomic gas just outside the region will be similar to the density of the ionized gas within the region , implying that @xmath105 . therefore , @xmath1 will be destroyed primarily by photodissociation , rather than associative detachment , if @xmath106 similarly , photodissociation will dominate the destruction of @xmath2 if @xmath107 how do these numbers compare with the results of the numerical simulations of region growth mentioned above ? to take one particular example , consider the region simulated by @xcite . at @xmath108 after the switch - on of the central ionizing source , the region in their simulation has a mean density @xmath109 and a size @xmath110 . at a later time , @xmath111 , its size has grown to @xmath112 , while its mean density has fallen to @xmath113 . in both cases , the diffuse flux from the region is strong enough to dominate the destruction of @xmath1 in the surrounding gas . it does not dominate the destruction of @xmath2 , but is important at the 1020% level . only once @xmath114 ( at which point @xmath115 and @xmath116 )",
    "does the diffuse flux decrease to a level at which it no longer dominates the destruction of @xmath1 .",
    "however , by this point in the evolution of the protogalaxy , the expansion of the central region has accelerated almost all of the surrounding gas to velocities greater than the protogalactic escape velocity .",
    "therefore , any @xmath0 that does manage to form via @xmath1 at @xmath117 will not be retained by the protogalaxy .",
    "although the preceding analysis is for gas located just outside the region , @xmath1 photodissociation will actually dominate out to much larger distances .",
    "this can be easily seen if we compare the dependence on radius of @xmath118 and @xmath119 . in the limit of large distances",
    ", @xmath118 scales with the distance @xmath98 as @xmath120 , while at smaller distances the scaling is less steep . if the density distribution of the neutral gas is given by @xmath121 , then @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath123 , then @xmath119 will fall off more steeply with increasing radius than @xmath118 . as simulations of population iii star formation generally find that @xmath124 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this implies that if @xmath1 photodissociation dominates near the region , it will also dominate throughout the remainder of the protogalaxy .",
    "the second scenario considered in this paper is that of a cloud of neutral hydrogen embedded in a large cosmological region .",
    "this arrangement of ionized and neutral gas may be encountered within the earliest protogalaxies after the formation of the first stars if any clumps of gas exist within these protogalaxies that are dense enough to survive the passage of the expanding ionization front ( i - front ) without being immediately photoevaporated @xcite . on larger scales ,",
    "this arrangement can also be used to represent primordial minihalos that have been enveloped by a large intergalactic region , but that have not yet been completely photoionized or photoevaporated ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for simplicity",
    ", i assume that both the neutral cloud and the surrounding region are spherically symmetric , with radii @xmath125 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "the cloud is assumed to have a power - law density profile @xmath126 with @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the density of the cloud at @xmath129 , which can be written in terms of the cloud mass @xmath130 as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . at early times ,",
    "the outer edge of the cloud will be photoionized , but will not yet have had time to dynamically respond to the increased pressure , and so will maintain the same density profile as the neutral gas .",
    "the density of ionized gas at radii @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the innermost extent of the ionized region , is therefore given by equation  [ sph_cl ] above , while at radii @xmath135 i take the ionized gas density , @xmath86 , to be constant . finally , it is necessary to specify the distance @xmath98 of the centre of the cloud from the centre of the region .",
    "these assumptions allow us to write the volume integral @xmath29 as @xmath136 \\nonumber \\\\   & + &   n_{\\rm i}^{2 } r_{\\rm i } f(x_{\\rm d } ) - n_{\\rm i}^{2 } r_{\\rm cl } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 and where @xmath92 is defined by equation  [ fx ] .",
    "the first term in this expression corresponds to the flux produced by the ionized outer edge of the cloud , while the second and third terms , taken together , correspond to the flux from the surrounding constant density region .",
    "we can explore the behaviour of this expression by considering a concrete example .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath138 , so that @xmath139 , and that @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    ". then @xmath29 becomes @xmath142 if @xmath143 , then the second term dominates , unless the density contrast between the cloud and the surrounding region is large .",
    "the first term dominates only if @xmath144 , while the third term is always negligible in these conditions .",
    "the required density contrast can be significantly reduced if we steepen the density profile of the cloud by increasing @xmath35 , or increase the fraction of it which is already ionized by decreasing @xmath134 .",
    "altering @xmath98 , on the other hand , has little effect on the required contrast .    to proceed with our example ,",
    "let us suppose that the region has a size @xmath145 and number density @xmath146 @xcite , that the cloud has a virial radius @xmath147 , and that @xmath148 .",
    "in that case , the flux from the ionized edge of the cloud dominates , @xmath149 , and the resulting @xmath1 and @xmath2 photodissociation rates are @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively . in comparison , @xmath152 and @xmath153 at @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , in this particular example the flux is of limited importance . if we were to assume that @xmath154 , rather than @xmath140 , however , then the photodissociation rates would increase by a factor of a thousand , while the collisional rates would increase by only a factor of a hundred . in that case , more @xmath1 would be destroyed by photodissociation than by associative detachment . on the other hand ,",
    "the photodissociation of @xmath2 would still be of limited importance .",
    "this simple example demonstrates that in this situation , radiative feedback due to the emission from the ionized gas is most effective during the final stages of the photoionization of the neutral cloud , when the highest density material is being photoionized .",
    "as we expect dynamical effects to have become important by this stage in the photoionization process @xcite , it is difficult to assess the ultimate importance of the feedback without performing more detailed calculations .",
    "the final scenario examined here is that of a so - called ` fossil ' region @xcite , i.e.  an region in which the ionized source has switched off . for simplicity ,",
    "i consider the evolution of the gas at the center of a spherically symmetric region with constant density @xmath86 and radius @xmath85 .",
    "if the gas is initially fully ionized , then @xmath29 at the moment of switch - off is given by @xmath155 if we again assume that the temperature of the ionized gas is @xmath78 , then the flux produced by the ionized gas gives rise to photodissociation rates for @xmath1 and @xmath2 that are given by @xmath156 as time passes , however , the gas in the region will recombine .",
    "since @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the fractional ionization of the gas , this means that both @xmath118 and @xmath159 will both decrease with time .",
    "if the temperature of the ionized gas were to be kept fixed , then these rates would also fall off as @xmath160 .",
    "in fact , it is likely that some cooling of the gas will occur and so the effects of the decrease in @xmath158 will be offset to some extent by an increase in the emission coefficient .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from table  [ tab : rates ] that changes in the emission coefficient will alter the rates by at most an order of magnitude , while a large decrease in @xmath158 may alter them by many orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , consideration of the simplified case in which @xmath48 is kept fixed serves to illustrate the basic behaviour of the gas without requiring one to model its thermal evolution .    for a intergalactic region with the same size and density as in the previous section ( i.e.  @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) , we therefore have @xmath161 the destruction rate of @xmath1 by associative detachment in the same conditions",
    "is given approximately by @xmath162 clearly , @xmath163 only if @xmath164 .",
    "however , if the fractional ionization is as high as this , then @xmath1 will also be destroyed rapidly by mutual neutralization with protons @xmath165 the rate coefficient of this reaction is uncertain , possibly by as much as an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "if we take the smallest of the values quoted in the literature , the rate of @xcite , then we find that the mutual neutralization rate in our example region is @xmath166 this is comfortably larger than @xmath118 for all temperatures in our range of interest .",
    "therefore , in this particular scenario , @xmath1 photodissociation is unimportant .",
    "comparison of the photodissociation rate of @xmath2 with the rate at which it is destroyed by charge transfer with @xmath167 ( reaction  [ r2 ] ) or by dissociative recombination @xmath168 leads to a similar conclusion regarding @xmath2 .",
    "can we avoid these conclusions by considering a larger region ? if we suppose that we have somehow managed to create a fossil region with @xmath169 , rather than @xmath170 , then it is easy to see that the resulting photodissociation rates would be a thousand times larger than in the case considered above .",
    "even so , associative detachment still dominates the destruction of @xmath1 if @xmath171 .",
    "similarly , photodissociation is unimportant in comparison to dissociative recombination or charge transfer for @xmath172 . since @xmath0 formation in cooling",
    ", recombining gas becomes significant only once @xmath171 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is clear that even in this somewhat unrealistic case , photodissociation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is unimportant .    the other way in which to increase the importance of photodissociation is by increasing the density of the ionized gas . if , instead of a large intergalactic region , we consider a small interstellar region with @xmath173 and @xmath174 , then we find that @xmath175 in this case , @xmath163 only if @xmath176 , while @xmath177 only if @xmath178 , so again the effects of photodissociation are unimportant .",
    "the results from the simple models considered in the previous section demonstrate that in some circumstances , bound - free , free - free and two - photon emission from ionized gas can combine to produce a significant @xmath1 photodissociation rate .",
    "the effect is very sensitive to the density of the ionized gas , since both the recombination rate and the free - free emission rate scale as the square of the density .",
    "however , the required densities are not excessively high and there are a number of situations in which we may encounter them .    the particular examples considered here in which @xmath1 photodissociation proves to be important are the early growth of an region around a population iii star , prior to its break - out from the confining protogalaxy (  [ expand ] ) and the late stages of the photoionization of a neutral cloud ( or minihalo ) by an external radiation source (  [ embed ] ) . on the other hand , photodissociation of @xmath1",
    "is not important within so - called ` fossil ' regions , owing to the rapid decrease of the photodissociating flux associated with the decrease in the fractional ionization of the recombining gas .",
    "the destruction of @xmath2 by emission from the ionized gas proves to be a less important effect , due to the much smaller photodissociation rate ( compared to @xmath1 ) that results from the same amount of emission .",
    "the main reason for this is that the @xmath2 photodissociaton cross - section is small ( or zero ) at the photon energies where much of the energy from the ionized gas is radiated , becoming significant only for photons with energies greater than about @xmath179 .",
    "nevertheless , even if @xmath2 survives where @xmath1 does not , the net effect is still a significant reduction in the @xmath0 formation rate , as @xmath0 formation via @xmath2 occurs much more slowly than @xmath0 formation via @xmath1 @xcite .",
