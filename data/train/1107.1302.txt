    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) during the past decade have shown that the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in heavy ion collisions are far more intriguing than originally conceived  @xcite . instead of weakly interacting ,",
    "the quark - gluon plasma was found to be a strongly coupled system with so small a shear viscosity that it behaves like an ideal fluid .",
    "the study of the qgp is expected to remain an active field of research in the future because of the proposed upgrade of rhic and new experimental possibilities at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the physics of qgp is related to a wide range of other fields , such as the early universe , nonequilibrium statistical physics , string theory by ads / cft correspondence , and so on .    during the same time",
    ", there have also been exciting developments in the spectroscopy of heavy hadrons , starting with the discovery of the @xmath0 by the babar collaboration  @xcite , whose mass could not be explained by the simple quark model , and the @xmath1 by the belle collaboration  @xcite , whose mass and decay channel strongly support a nontrivial fraction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 components in its wave function .",
    "the belle collaboration also reported the finding of the z@xmath4(4430 ) in the @xmath5 spectrum @xcite . because the z@xmath4(4430 ) is a charged state",
    ", it can not be a simple @xmath6 state .",
    "if confirmed , this would be the first evidence for the existence of an exotic hadron that is composed of two quarks and two antiquarks like @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the question of whether multiquark hadrons exist is an old problem in the light hadron sector that began with attempts to understand the inverted mass spectrum of the scalar nonet ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and so on ) in the tetraquark picture  @xcite .",
    "also , the exotic h dibaryon was proposed on the basis of the color - spin interaction  @xcite , and it has been sought for in various experiments for a long time without success . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath10 baryon resonance was considered as a @xmath11 quasi - bound state in the @xmath12 coupled - channel analysis  @xcite . with further development of the coupled - channel approach  @xcite",
    ", it has been realized that the @xmath10 is the most obvious and uncontroversial candidate for a hadronic molecule , whose wave function is composed dominantly of a @xmath11 bound state mixed with a small @xmath13 resonant state  @xcite .",
    "if such a configuration for the @xmath10 is confirmed in experimental measurements , it will be the first evidence for a molecular hadronic state .",
    "many new multiquark states such as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and _ etc . _ have also been predicted .",
    "while the z@xmath4(4430 ) could be a first explicitly exotic hadron found to date , it will be a milestone in hadronic spectroscopy if other flavor exotic hadrons are found , such as the controversial pentaquark @xmath17 first reported in experiments on photonuclear reactions  @xcite .",
    "also , several other flavor exotic molecular and compact multiquark hadrons were previously predicted , based , respectively , on the meson - exchange and color - spin interactions .",
    "more recently , a simple diquark model based on the color - spin interaction  @xcite was shown to naturally explain the likely existence of flavor exotic multiquark hadrons consisting of heavy spectator quarks , such as the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 that were predicted before , and the newly predicted dibaryon @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , the stable molecular bound states @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the charmed sector and the @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the bottom sector have been predicted to exist as a result of the long - range pion - exchange potential  @xcite .    to gain insights into all these proposals and questions  @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed in recent publications  @xcite a new approach of studying exotic hadrons in heavy ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "there are several merits for this approach compared to the search for exotic hadrons in elementary particle reactions that have been pursued so far .",
    "first , an appreciable number of heavy quarks are expected to be produced in these collisions , reaching as large as 20 @xmath26 pairs per unit rapidity in pb+pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "second , through vertex reconstruction of weakly decaying particles , one could substantially reduce the backgrounds in the detection , making the identification of weakly decaying exotics possible . finally ,",
    "because of the large volume of quark and hadronic matters formed in these collisions and the new paradigm of hadronization through coalescence  @xcite , various exotic hadrons could be formed from the recombinations of quarks .",
    "we have therefore investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite the possibility of using measurements in present and future experiments on heavy ion collisions to answer the longstanding problems in hadronic physics of identifying and examining hadronic molecular states and exotic hadrons that consist of multiquarks .    in the present paper",
    ", we extend the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite to include all exotic hadrons that have been proposed so far .",
    "these hadrons are classified as exotic mesons , exotic baryons , and exotic dibaryons , and for each exotic hadron we give a brief summary of its properties and the status on the latest researches .",
    "moreover , we collect all necessary references so that the present paper can be used as a general guide to the literatures on exotic hadrons . using these information",
    ", we then evaluate their yields in heavy ion collisions based on both the statistical and the coalescence model .",
    "in particular , we present a detailed description of the calculations carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite with an emphasis on the expected yields of exotic hadrons in heavy ion collisions at lhc .",
    "the statistical model is based on the assumption that hadrons produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions are in thermal and chemical equilibrium at temperatures that are close to that for the qgp to hadronic matter phase transition , and it has been known to describe very well the relative yields of normal hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the coalescence model , on the other hand , describes hadron production through the coalescence or recombination of particles  @xcite .",
    "the model has successfully explained observed enhancement in the production of midrapidity baryons in the intermediate transverse momentum region  @xcite , the quark number scaling of the elliptic flow of identified hadrons  @xcite , and the yield of antihypertritons recently discovered in heavy ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the coalescence model that takes into account the internal structure of hadrons has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be able to describe the observed suppression of the @xmath27 yield in heavy ion collisions at rhic compared to the prediction of the statistical model  @xcite .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we fix the parameters in the coalescence model by reproducing the yields of normal hadrons in the statistical model  @xcite .",
    "we then apply these two models to calculate the yields of exotic hadrons . as reference particles for the comparison with exotic hadrons",
    ", we consider , in particular , normal hadrons such as the strange @xmath28 and @xmath27 , the charmed @xmath29 , and the bottom @xmath30 .",
    "our results show that the yields of proposed exotic mesons , baryons , and dibaryons are large enough for carrying out realistic measurements .",
    "we further discuss their most probable weak decay channels that can be observed in experiments .",
    "our study shows that results from the coalescence model are sensitive to the inner structure of hadrons , such as the angular momentum , quark numbers and so on . this is different for the statistical model , because the yields of the hadrons in this model are determined mainly by their masses . to discriminate the different pictures for exotic hadrons",
    ", we can thus compare the results from the coalescence model with those from the statistical model .",
    "we find that the relative yields of light exotic hadrons in the coalescence model are very different from those in the statistical model , and this makes it possible to experimentally discriminate among the different pictures for their structures , such as multiquarks versus hadronic molecules .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ coal ] , we describe briefly the schematic model used for describing the time evolution of the hot dense matter formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we then explain the statistical model and the coalescence model used in the present study .",
    "the properties of the exotic hadrons included in this work and their predicted yields are given in secs .",
    "[ properties ] and [ results ] , respectively .",
    "this is followed by discussions in sec .  [ discussion ] and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] . in appendix",
    "a , we derive the wigner function of hadrons whose structures are described by the @xmath31-wave and the corresponding coalescence factor .",
    "we further give in appendix b the coalescence factors for the general @xmath32-wave harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "for the dynamics of central relativistic heavy ion collisions , we use the schematic model of ref .",
    "@xcite based on isentropic boost invariant longitudinal and accelerated transverse expansions . in this model , both the initial quark - gluon plasma and final hadronic matter are treated as noninteracting free gas , and the transition between these two phases of matter is taken to be first - order .",
    "the time evolution of the temperature and volume of the system is determined by the entropy conservation . in table",
    "[ parametersa ] , we tabulate the values of the critical or hadronization temperature @xmath33 and volume @xmath34 at the beginning of the quark - gluon to hadronic matter phase transition , the volume @xmath35 at the end of the mixed phase or hadronization , and the kinetic or thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath36 and volume @xmath37 for both central au+au collisions at @xmath38 gev at rhic and central pb+pb collisions at @xmath39 tev at lhc . also given in table  [ parametersa ] is the abundance of various quarks at @xmath33 .",
    ".quark numbers at hadronization temperature @xmath33 and volume @xmath34 , the volume @xmath35 at the end of hadronization , and the thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath36 and volume @xmath37 in central heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparisons of the yields in the @xmath40 column to those in the @xmath41 column in table  [ tab : hadron ] show that for most of the hadronic states considered here , the yield from the coalescence model for the compact multiquark state is smaller than that for the usual quark configuration as a result of the suppression due to the coalescence of additional quarks indicated in eq .",
    "( [ coal - factors ] ) . for the same state ,",
    "the yield from the coalescence model for the molecular configuration is , however , larger than that from the statistical model prediction as seen from comparing the yields in the mol .",
    "column to those in the stat .",
    "column in table  [ tab : hadron ] .",
    "this is in contrast to high energy pp collisions , where molecular configurations with small binding energies are hard to be produced at high @xmath42  @xcite .       to see more clearly the effect of the structure of a hadron on its production in heavy ion collisions , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : list ] the ratio of the coalescence model results to those from the statistical model , @xmath43 generally , the ratios for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 configurations are within the range of @xmath46 for normal hadrons , which is shown by the grey zone .",
    "this also applies to exotic hadrons with most of the @xmath47 configurations , as shown by the triangles .",
    "we observe that the coalescence yield for an exotic multiquark hadron ( diamond ) is smaller than those for the usual quark configuration and from the statistical model predictions .",
    "this is consistent with the naive expectation that the multiquark coalescence becomes suppressed as the quark number increases",
    ". the tetraquark states @xmath48 and @xmath49 are typical examples . in these hadrons ,",
    "tetraquark configurations necessarily involve strange quarks , and they are thus more suppressed .",
    "this suppression also applies to the @xmath50 states in exotic baryons ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and the @xmath53 state in the @xmath15 .",
    "the yields of hadronic moleculars from the hadron coalescence ( circles ) depend strongly on the sizes of hadrons . for deeply bound and compact hadronic molecules , their yields are comparable to or smaller than the predictions of the statistical model . on the other hand ,",
    "the loosely bound extended molecules would be formed abundantly .",
    "one typical example is @xmath10 that are shown in table  [ summary ] for the two cases of @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the smaller value",
    ", corresponding to a small binding  @xcite , gives a larger size for the @xmath10 . as a result , antikaons produced in heavy ion collisions have larger probabilities of coalescing with nucleons , resulting in more abundant production of @xmath10 . on the other hand , for the larger @xmath56 value , which corresponds to the case that the pole position of the s - matrix for the two - hadron interaction is around @xmath57",
    ", the @xmath10 can be regarded as a deeply bound state and thus has a smaller size , and hence its yield becomes smaller .",
    "our results based on the coalescence model for hadron production in relativistic heavy ion collisions have indicated that their yields are strongly dependent on their structures . therefore",
    ", measuring the yields of exotic hadrons allows us to infer the internal configuration of exotic hadrons @xcite .",
    "for example , we have mentioned in sec .",
    "[ results ] a that as possible configurations for @xmath48 , quark - antiquark pairs ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ) , a tetraquark state , and a @xmath61 hadronic molecule have been proposed . to confirm its structure",
    ", we refer to preliminary data from the star collaboration for the production yield ratios of @xmath48 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63@xcite . from these results",
    "we find that the measured yield of @xmath48 is close to 8 , which means that it is more probable for the @xmath48 to be produced as a hadronic molecule state than a tetraquark state ( see the order of magnitude difference between the yield in the @xmath41 column and that in the mol .",
    "column in table  [ tab : hadron ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the star data seem to rule out a dominant tetraquark configuration for the @xmath48 . further experimental efforts to reduce the error bar are thus highly desirable .    for some exotic hadrons ,",
    "our results show that the yields are similar for the hadronic and the molecular configuration , despite the difference in the coalescence temperatures @xmath33 and @xmath36 .",
    "this can be attributed to the larger size of the molecular configuration .",
    "assuming other factors are similar , the @xmath64-wave factors involved in the coalescence at @xmath36 are similar to those at @xmath33 as long as the relevant molecular size is related to the hadron size as @xmath65 as can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ coal - factors ] ) after neglecting the temperature dependence in the denominator .",
    "if we additionally assume that the volume scales as @xmath66 , we find that the condition for the molecular coalescence to be similar to two - quark coalescence is that the molecular size scales as @xmath67 , which is more or less satisfied by some exotic hadrons considered here , such as the @xmath68 .",
    "our study also shows the interesting result that the ratio @xmath69 of the yield in the coalescence model to that in the statistical model is almost the same at rhic and lhc .",
    "this similarity comes from the universal feature of the qcd phase transition ; the common critical temperature and the common volume ratio @xmath70 . in the non - relativistic approximation shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : statnr ] ) , it is possible to rewrite the statistical model yield in the coalescence - like form , @xmath71 where we consider the hadron @xmath72 to be composed of several constituents , @xmath73 is the binding energy , and @xmath74 represents the yield of the @xmath75-th constituent at the volume @xmath35 .",
    "this relation holds since the fugacity of a particle is equal to the product of the constituent fugacities , and the particle fugacity is related to the yield according to @xmath76    by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : statprod ] ) and ( [ nquark ] ) , the ratio @xmath69 is found to be approximately given as @xmath77 since @xmath33 and @xmath78 are the same at small baryon chemical potential , the particle density @xmath79 and the volume ratio @xmath70 would be common at rhic and lhc . as a result",
    ", the ratio of the production yield of hadrons in the coalescence model to that in the statistical model becomes the same at rhic and lhc .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] , we show the hadron mass dependence of the ratio @xmath80 in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the results are similar in heavy ion collisions at lhc as discussed in the above .",
    "it is seen that the effect of the internal structures of exotic hadrons on @xmath80 is particularly large for light exotic hadrons .",
    "we also show the ratio for normal hadrons . here",
    "we have included the resonance decay contribution to pseudoscalar mesons such as @xmath81 in evaluating the ratio .",
    "this estimate would be closer to the observational condition .",
    "as already mentioned , the ratios for normal hadrons are found to be in the range of @xmath82 .",
    "it should be noted that the coalescence model may overestimate the yield of very loosely bound molecules .",
    "since the average hadron distance is around 2 fm and the temperature is @xmath83 at the thermal freeze - out , the loosely bound and spatially extended hadrons would dissociate easily through the final - state interactions with other hadrons .",
    "for example , the deuteron yield is calculated to be around 1.4 per unit rapidity , which is larger than the statistical model prediction ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "experimental data seems to be consistent with the statistical model result , suggesting the possibility of later coalescence of loosely bound particles with a few mev binding energies  @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have proposed a new approach of studying exotic hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc .",
    "we have considered the yields of proposed exotic hadrons ; @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath85 , @xmath68 , @xmath86 , @xmath1 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for exotic mesons , @xmath10 , @xmath89 , @xmath14 , @xmath22 , @xmath90 , @xmath52 , @xmath24 and @xmath91 for exotic baryons , @xmath92 , @xmath15 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 for exotic dibaryons . to obtain the yields of these exotic multiquark hadrons or hadronic molecular states , we have used the coalescence model based on either the quark degrees of freedom or the hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "our results indicate that the yields of many exotic hadrons are large enough to be measurable in experiments .",
    "in particular , heavy exotic hadrons containing charm and bottom quarks as well as strange quarks can be possibly observed at rhic and especially at lhc .",
    "therefore , relativistic heavy ion collisions will provide a good opportunity to search for exotic hadrons .",
    "in particular , it may lead to the first observation of new exotic hadrons .",
    "also , we have found that the structure of light exotic hadrons has a significant effect on their yields in heavy ion collisions . for a hadron of normal quark structure",
    ", its production yield relative to the statistical model prediction @xmath95 is found in the range of @xmath82 .",
    "the yield ratio is smaller ( @xmath96 ) if a hadron has a compact multiquark configuration . for a hadron of molecular configuration with an extended size ,",
    "its yield is , on the other hand , larger than the normal values ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "therefore , the ratios of measured yields from experiments on heavy ion collisions to those predicted by the statistical model provides a new method to discriminate the different pictures for the structures of exotic hadrons .",
    "the study of exotic hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions thus will help answer longstanding problems on the existence and structure of exotic hadrons .",

    "<S> we investigate the possibilities of using measurements in present and future experiments on heavy ion collisions to answer some longstanding problems in hadronic physics , namely identifying hadronic molecular states and exotic hadrons with multiquark components . </S>",
    "<S> the yields of a selected set of exotic hadron candidates in relativistic heavy ion collisions are discussed in the coalescence model in comparison with the statistical model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the yield of a hadron is typically an order of magnitude smaller when it is a compact multiquark state , compared to that of an excited hadronic state with normal quark numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that some loosely bound hadronic molecules are formed more abundantly than the statistical model prediction by a factor of two or more . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the significant numbers of charm and bottom quarks produced at rhic and even larger numbers expected at lhc , some of the proposed heavy exotic hadrons could be produced with sufficient abundance for detection , making it possible to study these new exotic hadrons in heavy ion collisions . </S>"
