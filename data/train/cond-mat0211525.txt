    "@xcite a number of other works have either explicitly or implicitly addressed the role of the relative sign of the tunneling matrix elements.@xcite in this paper , we consider quantum dots with many levels and consider several possible distributions of the signs in the tunneling matrix elements for each energy level in a quantum dot .",

    "transmission zeros can arise from the interference between the possible current paths through the multiple energy levels in a dot , and can explain the abrupt phase jump by @xmath1 .",
    "we find from our model study that the oscillating behavior in the transmission phase is a result of having the same relative signs in the tunneling matrix elements",

    "successive transmission zeros start to appear again in the transmission amplitude while the energy level @xmath136 is filled by electrons . the absence of the transmission zeros is realized only when going from @xmath122 to @xmath136 .    in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "time - reversal symmetry is broken and the wavefunctions can not be chosen to be real .",
    "the relative signs are still @xmath132 for the state @xmath127 if the tunneling barrier potential is real and the electron s wavefunction in the one - channel leads are not modified in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the transmission phase will behave in the same way as for @xmath137 when the magnetic field is weak enough for level - crossing not to occur . in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "energy level - crossing starts to occur and the distribution of the relative signs is modified as well .",
    "we believe that keeping track of the relative signs is possible experimentally just like monitoring the coulomb peaks in the conductance . when the magnetic field is strong enough that only the lowest landau level is filled , the energy levels will be ordered with an increasing azimuthal quantum number @xmath116 . for this case",
    ", the relative signs will oscillate from level to level .",
    "however , the spin - degeneracy can double the oscillating period in the relative signs .",
    "in this paper we considered several possible distributions of the relative signs in the tunneling matrix elements and studied the effects of these signs on the transmission zeros and phase . when the tunneling matrix elements are much smaller than the interlevel spacing or the distance between the coulomb peaks , we find the following general rules governing the relation between the relative signs and the transmission zeros or phase . when the relative signs are opposite for the two neighboring energy levels , a transmission zero is absent in the energy interval bounded by the two levels . when the relative signs are the same for two neighboring energy levels , one transmission zero is generated inside the energy interval bounded by two levels",
    "silva , et .",
    "@xcite studied a quantum dot with two energy levels and found these same results . in our work",
    "we find that the above two rules are generally true even in the presence of other energy levels in a dot , as far as the linewidths are much smaller than the energy level spacing .",
    "based on the above two rules , we can predict the behavior of the transmission zeros and phase from the distribution of the relative signs .",
    "a uniform distribution of signs within some energy interval leads to transmission zeros in between any pair of conductance peaks .",
    "the oscillating distribution of signs completely removes the transmission zeros .    when the strength of the tunneling matrix elements becomes larger comparable to the interlevel spacing ,",
    "the above simple rules are modified .",
    "one example is when one energy level is coupled much more strongly to the two leads than other levels . when the strongly coupled level is broad enough to cover several neighboring energy levels , this broad level can act as the continuum band to the neighboring narrow levels and fano interference occurs .",
    "the fano interference results in an asymmetrical lineshape as well as the generation of new transmission zeros which are otherwise absent .",
    "since we did not take into account in full length the coulomb interaction between electrons in the quantum dot , some care is needed to apply our theoretical results to the real quantum dots . in the hartree approximation",
    ", the coulomb energy mainly shifts the chemical potential or determines the poles of the green s function of a dot . when the tunneling matrix elements are so small that the coulomb blockade peaks are well separated and narrow , our theory will be relevant to the experiments .",
    "we have emphasized that the transmission zeros can be located by inspecting the fano interference shape in @xmath70 as a function of the gate voltage and the magnetic field .",
    "the ab phase shifts the transmission zeros off the real - energy axis and modulates the shape of @xmath70 .",

    "some experimental groups@xcite have observed an asymmetrical lineshape of @xmath140 as a function of the gate voltage . this feature may be understood in terms of the interference between multiple energy levels in a dot and the distribution of the relative signs in the tunneling matrix elements .    in summary",
