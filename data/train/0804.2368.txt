    "the discovery of the wave - property of light was probably made by @xcite , who managed to produce light interferences by letting it go through 2 close holes . soon after this discovery , @xcite proposed and @xcite tried unsuccessfully to use this wave - property of light to measure the apparent diameter of stars at the _ observatoire de marseille _ with a 80 cm telescope .",
    "then , @xcite managed to measure the diameter of a star , betelgeuse , equal to 0,047  with a relative accuracy of 10% using a larger interferometer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometre_michelson ] , left ) this experiment was very hard to carry out , the first results @xcite were so encouraging that a larger and more sensitive stellar interferometer @xcite was built .",
    "however , technical drawbacks and mechanical instabilities were the major problems of these interferometers .",
    "then , the project was abandonned during the second world war .    when the very first radio - telescopes put into operation , @xcite , the idea to coherently combine together several antennas was used to build radio - interferometers @xcite .",
    "this enabled an increase in the spatial resolution of radio - collectors @xcite .",
    "an easy access to the measures allowed a swift progress of the instruments .",
    "this led to the vla ( very large array , * ? ? ? * ) and to the vlba ( very long baselines array , * ? ? ? * ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : visibilities ]",
    "i have reported the main things to know about astronomical optical interferometry : a short history , the main principles , and the main properties of the measurements one gets from optical long baseline interferometry . using this information , and by doing the practical exercises associated with this article , a future observer should be able to prepare observations knowing the real limitations but also the true possibilities of today s interferometers .",
    "the author thank the max - planck institut for radioastronomy for support and funding through a stipend for the years 2007 and 2008 . thanks also to gerhard hdepohl who allowed use of one of his aerial photos in the amber data reduction software .",
    "part of this work and figures were made with the yorick scientific software and amdlib amber data reduction software .",
