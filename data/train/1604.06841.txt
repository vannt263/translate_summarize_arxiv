    "interestingly , for the tbm model of the molecule , supposing that the inter @xmath0-orbital exchange integral @xmath51 is negligible compared to the on - site ( intra single @xmath0 orbital ) coulomb correlation energy @xmath52 , the estimated direct ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two modes become vanishingly small compared to direct coulomb integrals .",

    "we may consider the lsda solution as a variational estimation of the true system , where quantum mechanical exchange splitting should be the order of the lsda mean - field splitting .",
    "an energy gap @xmath22 separates these zero modes from the other mos .",
    "even if we consider magnetic perturbations , the value of @xmath22 is of the order of @xmath55 , which amounts to @xmath56ev , and is larger than the expected magnetic interaction , which would not exceed a few tens of mev .",
    "therefore , degeneracy in the ground state of vang would appear as nearly degenerate magnetic multiplets , which allows us to design curious quantum - information - device applications .",
    "we comment on stability of vang as a kekul pah .",
    "we can find several kekul structures for each vang molecule .",
    "the concluded singlet ground state is consistent with this observation .",

    "i.e. _ a and b sublattices .",
    "when we consider s3zm , we need to write a chiral wave function whose amplitudes are non - zero only on b - sites .",
    "there remains pseudo - spin degrees of freedom , which are represented by the wave function at the dirac points @xmath96 and @xmath97 with the position vector @xmath98 of each carbon atom ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "we introduce the cartesian coordinate whose origin is at one of b - sites .",
    "then , two of basic vectors , @xmath100 and @xmath101 with a bond length @xmath102 may be introduced to represent @xmath98 . with these vectors ,",
    "the k - vectors for two k points are @xmath103 and @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "although @xmath96 and @xmath97 are complex valued , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are real valued functions .",
    "interestingly , amplitudes of @xmath108 are identical to s3zm in their distribution .",
    "therefore , a remaining point to be shown is that the boundary condition of vang is consistent with this zero - energy wave function .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath108 is zero at the origin , and the zero - sum rule for this wave function is assigned at each a - site , so that creation of the center b - site vacancy has no effect on the zero - sum rule for this wave function .",
    "we may cut a graphene structure in a fragment without harming the zero - sum rule for @xmath108 by the next manner .",
    "when one create boundary by cutting c - c bonds , a boundary site with two - fold bond connection appears .",
    "we should consider these boundary sites only .",
    "if each a - site at the boundary is surrounded by two b - sites with finite amplitudes of @xmath108 , since the phase of the wave function at one of sites has to be opposite to that at the other site , the zero - sum rules are not affected .",
    "actually , the boundary of vang defined in the text satisfies this rule in general .",
