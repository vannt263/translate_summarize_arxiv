    "non - equilibrium kinetics of diffusion - limited reactions has been the subject of much recent interest  @xcite .",
    "while equilibrium systems can be completely analyzed by means of standard thermodynamics methods , and reaction - limited processes are well described by classical rate equations  @xcite , there exist no such general approaches to the problem of non - equilibrium , diffusion - limited reactions .",
    "a fundamental model for the reaction rate in diffusion - limited processes had been presented by von  smoluchowski  @xcite . in this model , an ideal spherical trap",
    "is surrounded by a swarm of brownian particles . the rate of absorption of particles into the spherical trap models the reaction rate .",
    "the smoluchowski model is limited in two important respects : ( a ) the particles react with the spherical trap but _ not _ with each other , and ( b ) the trap itself does not diffuse , but remains static at the origin . both limitations",
    "are unphysical : in real reaction processes all particles interact ( and may react ) with each other , and _ all _ particles are mobile .",
    "several attempts have been made to remove the restriction of an immobile trap  @xcite .",
    "the problem is complicated by the apparent correlations in the motion of the surrounding particles : with a mobile trap , the motion of the surrounding particles is highly correlated , since a step of the trap to the left , say , in the lab frame of reference , results in an apparent step to the right of _ all _ the surrounding particles in unison , in the trap s frame of reference .",
    "results are restricted to empirical formulas inspired by numerical simulations  @xcite , or to a number of special cases ( immobile particles  @xcite ; short times  @xcite ) . as regards reactions between the surrounding particles ,",
    "these could hardly be considered , other than numerically , because few models of diffusion - limited kinetics yield themselves to exact analysis .",
    "in fact , diffusion - limited coalescence ( @xmath1 ) and annihilation ( @xmath2 ) in one dimension alone account for most of the known exact results  .",
    "recently , we have studied reversible coalescence , @xmath0 , on the line and in the presence of a _ static _ trap  @xcite .",
    "an exact analysis is possible with the method of interparticle distribution functions ( ipdf )  @xcite .",
    "we have found a remarkable property of  shielding \" : the particle nearest to the trap effectively shields the remaining particles from the trap .",
    "the steady state of the system is uniquely characterized by the distance of the nearest particle to the trap  all other particles remain distributed exactly as in the equilibrium state of the system in the absence of a trap . this shielding property persists even in the presence of a bias field ( convection , or drift ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider reversible coalescence with a _ mobile _ trap which diffuses with a diffusion constant @xmath3 , not necessarily equal to the diffusion constant of the surrounding particles , @xmath4 .",
    "the problem may still be formulated with the ipdf method , in spite of the correlations induced by the motion of the trap .",
    "the shielding property of the nearest particle to the trap also remains in effect , and it enables us to find a complete exact description of the distribution of particles in the long - time asymptotic limit .",
    "we find that relative to the trap the surrounding particles remain at equilibrium , but the gap to the nearest particle is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "an interesting generalization is to the case when the backward process @xmath6 is not limited to the particles alone , but the trap too may act as a source .",
    "again , the rate of generation of particles from the trap , @xmath7 , need not coincide with @xmath8 , the production rate from the reverse birth reaction .",
    "we find that if @xmath9 the shielding property breaks down , and we are unable to derive a complete exact description of the system .",
    "however , if the birth rate is @xmath10 , the effect of the trap is nullified : the particles remain distributed as in equilibrium , as if the trap were not present .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we review the coalescence process and the ipdf method used for its analysis . the model with a mobile trap",
    "is considered in section  [ sec : mobile_trap ] . in section  [ sec : trap - source ] , we generalize to the case where the trap may also act as a source .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion , in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our model @xcite is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of lattice spacing @xmath11 .",
    "each site is in one of two states : occupied by a particle @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , or empty ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "particles hop randomly to the nearest neighbor site to their right or left , at rate @xmath15 .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit of @xmath16 the particles undergo diffusion with a diffusion constant @xmath4",
    ". a particle may give birth to an additional particle , into a nearest neighbor site , at rate @xmath17 ( on either side of the particle ) rather than @xmath18 , to achieve a more aesthetic form of the final result . ] . if hopping or birth occurs into a site which is already occupied , the target site remains occupied .",
    "the last rule means that coalescence , @xmath1 , takes place _ immediately _ upon encounter of any two particles .",
    "thus , the system models the diffusion - limited reaction process @xmath19 the dynamical rules of the model are illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "reaction rules : ( a ) diffusion ; ( b ) birth ; and coalescence , ( c ) following diffusion , and ( d ) following a birth event .",
    "the broken lines in ( a ) and ( b ) indicate alternative target sites .    an exact treatment of the problem is possible through the method of empty intervals , known also as the method of inter - particle distribution functions ( ipdf )  @xcite .",
    "the key concept is @xmath20the probability that sites @xmath21 are empty at time @xmath22 .",
    "the probability that site @xmath23 is occupied is @xmath24 the event that sites @xmath23 through @xmath25 are empty ( prob .",

    "it is simpler to pass to the continuum limit .",
    "we write @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and replace @xmath20 with @xmath44 . letting @xmath16 , eq .",

    "we now consider the coalescence model but with a trap which diffuses with a diffusion constant @xmath3 : in the discrete representation , the trap hops to its right or left at rate @xmath68 . a particle that hops into the trap is irreversibly captured by it .",
    "similarly , when the trap hops onto an occupied site it captures the particle in that site .",
    "it is convenient to analyze the system in the trap s frame of reference . in this view , the trap remains static at a site which we choose to be the origin ; @xmath69 .",
    "when the trap does not move ( in the lab frame of reference ) the changes to @xmath26 are described by eq .",

    "putting together all the terms in  ( [ mastereq ] ) and ( [ enm.trap ] ) , and passing to the continuum limit , we obtain @xmath74 which is now valid in the infinite wedge @xmath75 .",
    "the term with the mixed derivative is special : it arises because of the correlated motion of the particles in the reference frame of the trap .",
    "the trap at @xmath69 could be realized by holding that site empty , at all times .",
    "thus , it follows that @xmath76 , which results in the boundary condition ( in the continuum limit ) : @xmath77 in addition , the boundary condition  ( [ bc0 ] ) becomes @xmath78 while  ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bcpositive ] ) still apply , without change .",

    "<S> we study diffusion - limited coalescence , @xmath0 , in one dimension , in the presence of a _ diffusing _ trap . the system may be regarded as a generalization of von  smoluchowski s model for reaction rates , in that : ( a ) it includes reactions between the particles surrounding the trap , and ( b ) the trap is mobile  both considerations which render the model more physically relevant . </S>",
    "<S> as seen from the trap s frame of reference , the motion of the particles is highly correlated , because of the motion of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> an exact description of the long - time asymptotic limit is found using the ipdf method , and exploiting a  shielding \" property of reversible coalescence that was discovered recently . in the case where the trap also acts as a source  giving birth to particles  the shielding property breaks down , but we find an  equivalence principle \" : trapping and diffusion of the trap may be compensated by an appropriate rate of birth , such that the steady state of the system is identical with the equilibrium state in the absence of a trap . </S>"
