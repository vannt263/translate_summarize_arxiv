    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is known to play an important role for many exotic phenomena in condensed matter physics , such as topological insulators@xcite , topological superconductivity@xcite and unconventional magnetism@xcite .",
    "example materials include hgcdte quantum well@xcite , copper benzoate@xcite . in solid materials",
    ", soc originates from relativistic correction and widely exists in crystals with low symmetry .",
    "however , it is very weak in comparison with dominant energy scales and usually considered as a perturbation@xcite .",
    "moreover , its form strongly depends on the internal structure of the materials and is thus difficult to be tuned in experiments .",
    "these facts hinder our further understanding of the soc and related phenomena so far .",
    "recently , the realization of a synthetic soc in ultracold atomic systems made a substantial progress towards overcoming these difficulties . with a pair of tunable lasers by dressing two internal atomic states@xcite , lin _",
    "et al_. engineered a soc with equal rashba and dresselhaus weight in neutral atomic bose - einstein condensate . via modifying the interaction between two atomic states ,",
    "a quantum phase transition is observed .",
    "although the effects of the soc were found long time ago in solid materials , this is the first experimental observation of the soc in bosonic systems and its properties have not been fully explored yet .",
    "soon after that , the same type of the soc in fermion systems was realized in ultracold atomic experiments@xcite by the similar technique .",
    "the advantages of this synthetic soc is that its strength can be adjusted in experiments@xcite , allowing full access to the parameter region we are interested in .",
    "these experiments pave the way for deepening our understanding of the soc in both ultracold atomic systems and condensed matter physics .    up to now , whereas most experimental and theoretical studies on the soc mainly focus on continuous systems@xcite , some experimentalists and theorists recently turn to study related phenomena in optical lattices . on one hand , lattices are the basic structure in solid state physics and optical lattices are the key for simulating condensed matter physics@xcite in ultracold atomic setups . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of lattice systems over continuum is that a variety of analytical and numerical methods for studying strongly correlated systems have been well established in the past several decades . for examples , theoretical works based on spin wave ,",
    "slave boson and monte carlo have predicted a rich zero - temperature magnetic phase diagram@xcite for two - dimensional bosonic systems with rashba soc in the mott region .",
    "it includes ferromagnetic ( fm ) , antiferromagnetic ( af ) , spiral , vortex and skyrmion phases .",
    "more recently , unconventional superfluid ( sf ) phases have been found@xcite in the bose - hubbard model with various types of soc in two dimensions .",
    "these results are in contrast to the relatively simple mott insulator ( mi ) and sf phases for the two - component bose - hubbard model@xcite without the soc . in addition",
    ", fermionic lattice models with the rashba soc recently also become the context of theoretical investigations of some intriguing effects in various geometries such as ladders@xcite and square lattice@xcite .    in spite of those theoretical great interests in the rashba soc recently@xcite",
    ", there is no experimental realization of such a soc in ultracold atomic systems so far .",
    "therefore , in this paper we focus on the soc that has already been realized in ultracold atom experiments , which is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "since this soc is along one spatial direction and of abelian nature , it is natural to start our study on the effects of the soc from a one - dimensional model . in the tight - binding form , hamiltonian including the kinetic energy and the soc can be generally written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the annihilation ( creation ) operators at site @xmath3 for spin @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4 takes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , representing two internal states of atoms . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ ehtl ] ) is the kinetic energy and @xmath7 is the hopping matrix between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath8 describes the soc realized in experiments .",
    "its tight - binding form is represented by @xmath9 with @xmath10 being a soc strength .",
    "it turns out that @xmath8 can be eliminated by a site - dependent rotation in its internal space of each site , resulting in a renormalization of the hopping integral @xmath7 . to show this , we take the following rotation@xcite around y - axis at site @xmath3 , @xmath11 by substituting eq .",
    "( [ erotate ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ ehtl ] ) , and setting @xmath12 , one finds that @xmath8 disappears with @xmath7 renormalized to @xmath13 .",
    "however , a realistic hamiltonian inevitably involves some other terms such as interactions for correlations or a zeeman term for experiments , which we denote as @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath14 is invariant under the rotation ( [ erotate ] ) , the net effect of soc is merely renormalizing the hopping term and considered to be trivial in this case .",
    "the situation can be easily altered by introducing an ( artificial ) zeeman field into @xmath14 . in this case , the soc becomes relevant and new physical phenomena are expected to occur . in particular , in the presence of both the soc and zeeman field , a variety of exotic phases such as topological superconductivity have been proposed@xcite in fermion systems",
    ".    zeeman field definitely breaks the time - reversal symmetry and the polarization strongly depends on the direction of the zeeman field . instead ,",
    "in our work , we consider an experimentally relevant model without breaking time - reversal symmetry , i.e. a two - component bose - hubbard model with soc , which reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the same as hamiltonian ( [ ehtl ] ) but @xmath17 , @xmath18 is restricted for bosons here .",
    "@xmath19 is on - site intracomponent interaction and @xmath20 is the intercomponent one .",
    "@xmath21 is the boson number operator with spin @xmath4 at site @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath22 is the chemical potential to control the filling factor . when @xmath23 , the interaction part is invariant under the rotation ( [ erotate ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 can be eliminated@xcite , resulting in a standard two - component bose - hubbard model ( tbhm ) , which has been extensively studied in literature@xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath24 , the interaction part is not invariant any more under the rotation ( [ erotate ] ) .",
    "one can then expect that some new phenomena would emerge .",
    "for example , spontaneous @xmath25 symmetry breaking resulting from the competition between the kinetic energy and soc has been predicted@xcite for @xmath26 .",
    "we recall that hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] ) has a @xmath27 symmetry@xcite , described by the transformation @xmath28_{\\tau^{\\prime } \\tau } \\hat c_{i\\tau},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which indicates that only the total particle number is conserved",
    ". moreover , hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] ) is unchanged by interchanging @xmath7 and @xmath10 with the following transformation @xmath29 for every 4-sites with @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 represents the opposite spin of @xmath4 .",
    "these symmetries would be helpful for understanding the properties of hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] ) .",
    "particularly , we can define the ratio @xmath33 to establish a symmetric phase diagram with respect to the axis @xmath34 .",
    "the phases with @xmath35 $ ] can be readily figured out from those with @xmath36 $ ] in terms of the transformation ( [ exchange ] ) .    in the absence of @xmath8 , hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] )",
    "is reduced to the well - known tbhm . in large @xmath37 limit and at a unit",
    "filling , it can be mapped to a spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg model .",
    "in particular , when @xmath38 , its ground state is in a z - axis ising fm@xcite phase .",
    "consequently , its low - energy excitation is gapful .",
    "when a small @xmath8 is set in , we would expect that its ground state remains in such a gapped fm phase .",
    "this thus greatly motivates us in this work to explore how this magnetic order evolves as the soc increases continuously .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we derive an effective magnetic hamiltonian in large @xmath39 limit at a unit filling .",
    "we first discuss some special cases , where the effective hamiltonian can be simplified further so that we are able to give qualitative conclusions with available analytic results",
    ". then we present an accurate phase diagram which is established numerically by means of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite method . in section iii",
    ", we study the transition between the mi and the sf phases , the magnetic structures as well as the momentum distribution in sf phases .",
    "particularly , we focus on the evolution of the magnetic structure with respect to the soc in sf phases . in section iv , we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we discuss the magnetic properties in the mi phases at the unit filling .",
    "to understand the magnetic properties of hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] ) , it is natural to start our discussion from the deep mi region , i.e. , @xmath40 , where charge freedom is frozen and only spin freedom is involved at zero temperature . under such a restriction , the low - energy behavior of hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] ) can be effectively described by a spin-1/2 model . to see this , we split the hamiltonian into two parts , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 here , @xmath16 includes both the kinetic energy and the soc and is taken as a perturbation .",
    "the ground states of @xmath14 have one particle per site and is thus highly degenerate .",
    "to the second order , the effective hamiltonian can be derived as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the projection operator onto the subspace spanned by the ground states of @xmath14 , @xmath45 is the ground state energy of @xmath14 , and @xmath46 are the pseudo - spin operators with @xmath47 and @xmath48 pauli matrix .",
    "to derive hamiltonian ( [ eheff ] ) , we use the relations @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eheff ] ) is just a spin-1/2 xyz heisenberg model with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction@xcite . in some special cases",
    ", this hamiltonian can be mapped@xcite into an exactly solvable model .",
    "this would definitely shed light on our understanding of the properties of hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] ) .",
    "first , when @xmath51 , the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ eheff ] ) is a gapped ising fm state with the polarization in @xmath52 direction .",

    "( [ eheff ] ) has a gapped af ground state , which is readily known through the transformation ( [ exchange ] ) .",
    "thirdly , when @xmath54 , it is in a critical phase with gapless excitations .",
    "an important implication from above analysis is that there are at least two transition points when @xmath55 varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "and the upper dashed line is @xmath56 with @xmath57 , corresponding to the two critical points at @xmath58 .",
    "the red solid lines are fitting for the numerical data , given by the function @xmath59 for the lower boundary and @xmath60 for the upper boundary.,width=332 ]    to establish an accurate magnetic phase diagram , we employ the dmrg method to study the hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] ) . in our calculation",
    ", we take @xmath19 as the energy unit and fix @xmath61 , which well satisfy the above constraint @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the magnetic phase diagram in @xmath63 plane in a deep mott insulator region .",
    "one can see that the phase diagram consists of a gapped fm phase , a gapless chiral phase and a gapped af phase from the bottom to the top . in both the gapped fm and the gapped af phases ,",
    "the polarization is in z - axis .",
    "the phase boundary has a reflection symmetry with respect to the axis @xmath34 owing to the transformation ( [ exchange ] ) .",
    "according to our previous analysis based on the effective hamiltonian ( [ eheff ] ) , we know that @xmath64 corresponds to a gapped fm phase , which is in agreement with our numerical results .",
    "such a gapped fm phase extends to a finite @xmath65 , with @xmath65 depending monotonically on @xmath66 . further increasing @xmath55 drives the ground state into a gapless chiral phase and then transits from the gapless chiral phase into a gapped af phase at @xmath67 and stays in the gapped af phase for @xmath55 up to 1 .",
    "when @xmath58 , @xmath65 can be obtained@xcite exactly as @xmath68 . furthermore , we found that the two phase boundaries can be well fitted by a elegant formula @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , with @xmath71 .",
    "it is worthwhile to call for analytic works , for example , by bosonization technique , to gain further insightful information related to these interesting results .",
    "now let us discuss the difference among these three phases in terms of spin - spin correlation functions , chiral correlation functions and excitation gaps . for simplicity",

    "( [ nfit ] ) gives rise to @xmath171 .",
    "we noticed that @xmath172 , which is half of @xmath99 obtained by fitting @xmath96 of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] with eq .",
    "( [ szzfit ] ) at the same parameters .",
    "indeed , eq . ( [ nfit ] )",
    "is directly related to eq .",
    "( [ szzfit ] ) and @xmath173 always holds , not just at @xmath34 .",
    "this relation is verified for more @xmath55 by the dmrg calculations in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , where @xmath157 , @xmath99 and @xmath160 are plotted as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "clearly , the data for @xmath160 and @xmath99 fall into one curve , providing strong evidences for our conclusion .",
    "this is presumably because there are two pairs of operators ( @xmath174 or @xmath175 ) in @xmath96 but one in @xmath169 .",
    "moreover , in the chiral sf phase , @xmath157 and @xmath99 depend almost linearly on @xmath55 .",
    "these results may reflect a close relation between magnetic structures and sf pattern .",
    "finally , we remark that the incommensurability of the momentum distribution with @xmath168 signals the difference between the chiral sf phase and the fm ( af ) sf phase .",
    "the former has never been reported in tbhm@xcite , but shows up in a wide region in the presence of the soc , demonstrating a peculiar feature arising from the competition between the kinetic energy and the soc .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the evolution of the magnetic structure under a synthetic spin - orbit coupling in one - dimensional two - component bose - hubbard model with @xmath38 by using density - matrix renormalization group method .",
    "when @xmath123 is small and at the unit filling , three magnetic mi phases are found : a gapped fm phase , a gapless chiral phase and a gapped af phase .",
    "these magnetic orders persist to sf phases , leading to three different sf phases .",
    "in particular , in the chiral mi phase and chiral sf phase , the asymptotic behaviors of characteristic correlation functions are modulated incommensurately , demonstrating the novel effects on the competition between the kinetic energy and the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we believe that our findings will inspire further theoretical and experimental investigations on the effects of the spin - orbit coupling in lattice bosonic systems .",
