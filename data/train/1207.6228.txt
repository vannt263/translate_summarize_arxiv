    "measure - valued markov chains , or more generally measure - valued markov processes , arise naturally in modeling the composition of evolving populations and play an important role in a variety of research areas such as population genetics and bioinformatics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , bayesian nonparametrics @xcite , combinatorics @xcite and statistical physics @xcite . in particular , in bayesian nonparametrics there has been interest in measure - valued markov chains since the seminal paper by @xcite , where the law of the dirichlet process has been characterized as the unique invariant measure of a certain measure - valued markov chain .    in order to introduce the result by @xcite , let us consider a polish space @xmath0 endowed with the borel @xmath1-field @xmath2 and let @xmath3 be the space of probability measures on @xmath0 with the @xmath1-field @xmath4 generated by the topology of weak convergence . if @xmath5 is a strictly positive finite measure on @xmath0 with total mass @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a @xmath0-valued random variable ( r.v . ) distributed according to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a r.v .",
    "independent of @xmath7 and distributed according to a  beta distribution with parameter @xmath10 then , theorem 3.4 in @xcite implies that a dirichlet process @xmath11 on @xmath0 with parameter @xmath5 uniquely satisfies the distributional equation @xmath12 where all the random elements on the right - hand side of ( [ ftchain1 ] ) are independent .",
    "all the r.v.s introduced in this paper are meant to be assigned on a probability space @xmath13 unless otherwise stated . in @xcite , ( [ ftchain1 ] ) is recognized as the distributional equation for the unique invariant measure of a measure - valued markov chain @xmath14 defined via the recursive identity @xmath15 where @xmath16 is arbitrary , @xmath17 is a sequence of @xmath0-valued r.v.s independent and identically distributed as @xmath7 and @xmath18 is a sequence of r.v.s , independent and identically distributed as @xmath9 and independent of @xmath17 .",
    "we term @xmath14 as the feigin ",
    "tweedie markov chain . by investigating the functional markov chain , with @xmath19 for any @xmath20 and for",
    "any measurable linear function @xmath21 , @xcite provide properties of the corresponding linear functional of a dirichlet process .",
    "in particular , the existence of the linear functional @xmath22 of the dirichlet process @xmath11 is characterized according to the condition @xmath23 ; these functionals were considered by @xcite and their existence was also investigated by @xcite who referred to them as moments , as well as by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further developments of the linear functional markov chain @xmath24 are provided by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "starting from the distributional equation ( [ ftchain1 ] ) , a constructive definition of the dirichlet process has been proposed by @xcite . if @xmath11 is a dirichlet process on @xmath0 with parameter @xmath25 , then @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a sequence of independent r.v.s identically distributed according to @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a sequence of r.v.s independent of @xmath27 and derived by the so - called stick breaking construction , that is , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being a sequence of independent r.v.s identically distributed according to a beta distribution with parameter @xmath10 .",
    "then , equation ( [ ftchain1 ] ) arises by considering @xmath34 where now @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "thus , it is easy to see that @xmath38 is also a dirichlet process on @xmath0 with parameter @xmath5 and it is independent of the pairs of r.v.s @xmath39 .",
    "if we would extend this idea to @xmath40 initial samples , we should consider writing @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a dirichlet process on @xmath0 with parameter @xmath5 independent of the random vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , this is not an easy extension since the distribution of @xmath9 is unclear , and moreover @xmath9 and @xmath46 are not independent . for this reason , in @xcite an alternative distributional equation has been introduced .",
    "let @xmath5 be a strictly positive finite measure on @xmath0 with total mass @xmath6 and let @xmath47 be a @xmath0-valued plya sequence with parameter @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) , that is , @xmath47 is a sequence of @xmath0-valued r.v.s characterized by the following predictive distributions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for any @xmath50 .",
    "the sequence @xmath47 is exchangeable , that is , for any @xmath51 and any permutation @xmath1 of the indexes @xmath52 , the law of the r.v.s @xmath53 and @xmath54 coincide ; in particular , according to the celebrated de finetti representation theorem , the plya sequence @xmath47 is characterized by a so - called de finetti measure , which is the law of a dirichlet process on @xmath0 with parameter @xmath5 . for a fixed integer @xmath55 , let @xmath56 be a random vector distributed according to the dirichlet distribution with parameter @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and let @xmath9 be a r.v . distributed according to a beta distribution with parameter @xmath59 such that @xmath27 , @xmath60 and @xmath9 are mutually independent .",
    "moving from such a collection of random elements , lemma 1 in @xcite implies that a dirichlet process @xmath61 on @xmath0 with parameter @xmath5 uniquely satisfy the distributional equation @xmath62 where all the random elements on the right - hand side of ( [ ftchain3 ] ) are independent . in order to emphasize the additional parameter @xmath40 , we used an upper - script @xmath63 on the dirichlet process @xmath11 and on the random vector @xmath64 .",
    "it can be easily checked that equation  ( [ ftchain3 ] ) generalizes  ( [ ftchain1 ] ) , which can be recovered by setting @xmath65 .    in the present paper ,",
    "our aim is to further investigate the distributional equation ( [ ftchain3 ] ) and its implications in bayesian nonparametrics theory and methods .",
    "the first part of the paper is devoted to investigate the random element @xmath66 in ( [ ftchain3 ] ) which is recognized to be the random probability measure ( r.p.m . ) at the @xmath40th step of a measure - valued markov chain defined via the recursive identity @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a  sequence of independent r.v.s , each @xmath69 distributed according a  beta distribution with parameter @xmath70 , @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath55 and the sequence @xmath68 is independent from @xmath73 .",
    "more generally , we observe that the measure - valued markov chain defined via the recursive identity ( [ nuovacatena ] ) can be extended by considering , instead of a plya sequence @xmath73 with parameter  @xmath5 , any exchangeable sequence @xmath74 characterized by some de finetti measure on  @xmath3 and such that @xmath68 is independent from @xmath74 .",
    "asymptotic properties for this new class of measure - valued markov chains are derived and some linkages to bayesian nonparametric mixture modelling are discussed . in particular , we remark how it is closely related to a well - known recursive algorithm introduced in @xcite for estimating the underlying mixing distribution in mixture models , the so - called newton s algorithm .    in the second part of the paper , by using finite and asymptotic properties of the r.p.m .",
    "@xmath66 and by following the original idea of @xcite , we define and investigate from ( [ ftchain3 ] ) a class of measure - valued markov chain @xmath75 which generalizes the feigin  tweedie markov chain , introducing a fixed integer parameter @xmath40 .",
    "our aim is in providing features of the markov chain @xmath75 in order to verify if it preserves some of the properties characterizing the feigin ",

    "the role of the further parameter @xmath40 is discussed in terms of new potential applications of the markov chain @xmath75 with respect to the the known applications of the feigin  tweedie markov chain .    following these guidelines , in section [ sec2 ] we introduce a new class of measure - valued markov chains @xmath81 defined via exchangeable sequences of r.v.s ; asymptotic results for @xmath81 are derived and applications related to bayesian nonparametric mixture modelling are discussed . in section [ secthree ] , we show that the feigin  tweedie markov chain @xmath14 sits in a larger class of measure - valued markov chains @xmath75 , which is investigated in comparison with @xmath14 . in section [ sec4 ] , some concluding remarks and future research lines are presented .",
