    "since the introduction of the wigner function ( wf ) in 1932 for inclusion of quantum corrections to classical results@xcite , phase space representations of the quantum mechanics have been a focus of continuing interest and found a wide range of applications@xcite . in this formalism",
    "one defines a distribution function @xmath0 of position @xmath1 and momentum @xmath2 in such a way that to every normalized state vector @xmath3 there corresponds a distribution function . in order to define the same physical system",
    ", @xmath4 should be a hermitian form of @xmath5 , and if @xmath6 is integrated over @xmath2 it should give the proper probabilities of the different values of @xmath1 or vice versa . since the wf is a probability distribution function one expects , as a natural condition on @xmath7 , that it should be non - negative for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath8 .",
    "however , wigner@xcite proved that this result is incompatible with the first two conditions and it is now a common practice to work with a distribution function taking negative values for certain @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the phase space .    the quantum calogero - sutherland model ( csm ) having a quadratic confining @xmath9 plus an inversely quadratic @xmath10 potentials@xcite has applications in a wide variety of different areas of many body physics , due to the connection of its variants and itself directly with the hierarchical fractional quantum hall effect@xcite , free oscillators on a circle@xcite , the spectrum of the chern - simons matrix model@xcite , short range dyson model@xcite , and witten - dijkgraff - verlinde equation@xcite .",
    "additionally , many works have also been realized to construct its n - fermion version@xcite , @xmath11 algebra unification@xcite , shape invariance@xcite , generalized statistics@xcite , statistical properties of quantum quasi - degenaracy@xcite , equivalence to decoupled oscillators@xcite .",
    "in addition to allowing one to analyze the dynamics of quantum systems entirely in phase space and thus to make comparison between their classical and quantum evolutions , there is also experimental interest on the measurements of wfs for certain quantum systems to probe the predictions of quantum mechanics , since wf contains complete quantum mechanical information as the wave function or density matrix has .",
    "a number of experiments have been reported where the measurement of wfs carried out for both vacuum and quadrature - squeezed states of light@xcite , molecular vibrational states@xcite , various quantum states of the motion of a harmonically trapped atom @xcite , as well as for a massive particle wave packet@xcite .",
    "of particular importance are the experiments upon which the negatives in wfs corresponding to fock states@xcite and a superposition of macroscopically separated parts of matter field@xcite have been observed . in this regard , due to the fact that it is now possible to realize new quantum mesoscopic devices such as quantum dots and quantum antidots by various experimental techniques , the csm may serve as a model of two non - interacting electrons with an individual quantum antidot confined in a quantum wire or a stripe , where the repulsive inverse - square quantum antidot potential acts as a scattering center for electrons , or may be used as a one dimensional exactly soluble band model or quantum dot arrays wherein the coupling constant of the inverse - square potential of the csm is chosen as @xmath12 in dimensionless units , i.e. , attractive@xcite",
    "moreover , very recently , li _ et al_.@xcite have solved csm with pseudo - angular momentum operator method , and they showed that , by discussing its several variants , the radical equations of three dimensional isotropic oscillator and hydrogen - like atom in both spherical and parabolic coordinates , one dimensional three body problem and the s - state of morse potential all reduces to csm . therefore , wfs of csm may provide a solid basis for the discussions of transport properties@xcite of the above mentioned nanostructures . with these motivations , we study the wfs of csm which has not only a particular significance in itself , but also enables us to understand the phase space picture of its variants and itself as well .",

    "then , eq .  ( [ 2 ] ) can be separated as and relative wfs , @xmath7 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we can therefore define the wfs for the center - of - mass and relative motions in the form @xmath17 ,   \\label{3 } \\\\",

    "( [ 1 ] ) represent the two body wavefunctions , @xmath19 s in eq .",
    "( [ 2]-4 ) are single particle wave functions .",
    "now , it is possible to present a coupled system of linear partial differential equations corresponding to the above defined wf , which requires the direct computation without solving the wave functions@xcite .",
    "the wigner representation is very convenient for studying quantum systems with hamiltonians that include quadratic coordinates and momenta , since in this case the wigner distribution function represents a good approximate description of the dynamics involved .",
    "the method , however , is not easy to handle when the potential contains higher order powers of coordinates , since this case comprises a differential equation for the wigner function with terms as much as the number of the order . in recent years",
    "there has been a number of works to calculate the wf for various type of potentials : infinite square well@xcite , a double well potential@xcite , the psch - teller potential@xcite , the morse oscillator@xcite , a quantum damped oscillator@xcite , the hydrogen atom@xcite , the rotational motion of a spherical top@xcite are notable applications .",
    "a discrete wf for non - relativistic quantum systems with one degree of freedom has been developed in finite dimensional phase space and applied to a few simple system@xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we discuss wfs for the center - of - mass and relative motions , and obtain general expressions in terms of laguerre polynomials . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we derive a new identity between hermite and laguerre polynomials to obtain a compact form for the wf of the relative part , and plot some of them for a few states to give an idea on their phase space behaviors .",

    "if we now use the above defined center - of - mass and relative coordinates , then the relevant schrdinger equation is separated out as a center - of - mass equation , which is a 1d harmonic oscillator equation @xmath22 \\psi \\left ( q\\right ) = e_{q}\\psi \\left ( q\\right ) , \\label{6}\\ ] ] and the calogero - sutherland system @xmath23 \\psi \\left ( q\\right ) = e_{q}\\psi \\left ( q\\right ) ,   \\label{7}\\]]where we have defined @xmath24 as a hybrid frequency . in eqs .",

    "although it is possible to obtain the wfs for the simple harmonic oscillator ( eq .  ( [ 8 ] ) ) in various ways , for example , by using algebraic methods or by solving ordinary differential equations of wf @xcite , the wf corresponding to the relative motion resulting in the cs system can not be obtained by either methods .",

    "namely , by using jacobi coordinates , after separating the center - of - mass coordinate , one can easily construct the remaining part of wf with @xmath117 relative coordinates .",
    "furthermore , due to the fact that , with particular choices of the coupling constant @xmath118 , the radical equation of three dimensional isotropic oscillator and of hydrogen - like atom in both spherical and parabolic coordinates , one dimensional three body problem and the s - state of morse potential@xcite are all reduced to calogero - sutherland system , the results obtained here unify inherently the wfs of these quantum mechanical problems .    as a final remark , we should point out that the attractive interaction , i.e. , @xmath119 , is also present in the csm .",
    "therefore , one can easily compare the phase space behaviors of wfs of two different regimes as well .",
    "in particular , it should be noted that a particular choice of @xmath118 , when @xmath119 , yields one dimensional band problem solved by scarf@xcite .",
    "this serves as a model for one dimensional dot arrays , as also indicated in the introduction section .",
