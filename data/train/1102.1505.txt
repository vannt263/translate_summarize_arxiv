    "the study of systems made by mesons and baryons and the interpretation of the states found in them is one of the challenging issues in theoretical as well as in experimental hadron and nuclear physics .",
    "some historical examples , which even now continue to be of current interest , are : the study of the @xmath13 interaction and the formation of the @xmath14 as a quasibound state @xcite , the searching of bound states in the @xmath15 system @xcite , the possibility that some scalar resonances , like the @xmath5 and @xmath6 , could be considered as hadronic molecular states of a system made by a @xmath16 and a @xmath17 @xcite and the consideration of the scalar nonet as @xmath18 states with a meson - meson admixture @xcite .    in the last decade , the study of few hadron systems within effective field theories has represented a step forward in the understanding of the properties of many hadron resonances and bound states . in particular , the use of effective chiral lagrangians to describe the meson - baryon and meson - meson interactions implemented with unitarity in coupled channels has shed new light on the nature of several meson and baryon states like the ones studied in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see refs .",
    "for example , in the meson sector for strangeness @xmath19 , within unitarity chiral theories , the @xmath5 and @xmath20 states can be understood as dynamical generated states in the @xmath12 and @xmath21 interactions in s - wave , while the @xmath6 resonance gets dynamically generated in the @xmath12 and @xmath22 channels @xcite .",
    "the use of unitarity chiral theories has been also successful in the description of the meson - baryon interaction .",
    "for instance , for strangeness @xmath23 , the study of the @xmath24 and coupled channels system in @xmath25-wave has revealed the dynamical generation of the @xmath14 resonance with a double pole structure : one pole , around 1426 mev and with a width of 16 mev , which couples strongly to the @xmath26 channel , and another one , with a mass around 1390 mev and a width of 66 mev , which couples more to the @xmath27 channel @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the @xmath14 can be described as a dynamically generated resonance without introducing an explicit pole term  @xcite . in case of @xmath19 , the investigation of the @xmath28 system and coupled",
    "channels in s - wave revealed significant contributions of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 component to the @xmath31 resonance  @xcite .    in all these systems",
    "the kaons play an important role in the dynamics due to their heavy mass ( as compared to the pion ) and nambu - goldstone boson nature . as mentioned above ,",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath12 interactions are strongly attractive in s - wave , and the fact that the kaon has a mass around 3.5 times bigger than the pion makes the s - wave interactions involving kaons more effective than those involving pions , especially around the threshold energy . in addition , knowing that the typical kaon kinetic energy in the bound systems estimated by the hadronic interaction range is small in comparison with the kaon mass , one may treat the kaons in few - body systems within non - relativistic potential models .",
    "recently , special interest has developed for few - body systems constituted by one or more kaons .",
    "for example , the @xmath32 system has been the object of thorough studies  @xcite and all of them indicate the presence of a quasibound state with a large width .",
    "baryonic systems with two kaons , like @xmath33 and @xmath34 , were also investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite with a single channel variational method and a new @xmath35 state around 1910 mev with @xmath36 was predicted in the first case , while a very weakly bound state was found in the second case .",
    "a peculiar feature of these states is that they can be considered as loosely bound systems in which the identity of the constituent hadrons is kept and , thus , can be regarded as hadronic molecular states .",
    "reflecting this fact , the inter - hadron distances are compatible with typical nucleon distances in nuclei and the size of the @xmath33 system is as large as @xmath37he @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 resonance described in the unitary chiral model also has a larger spatial size than a typical baryon in its ground state  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 system was also investigated solving the faddeev equations to obtain the three - body @xmath39-matrix for the system and also resulted in the finding of a @xmath35 resonance around 1920 mev @xcite , confirming in this way the prediction done in ref .",
    "the approach employed in refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the idea of extending the unitary chiral models successfully used to study two hadron interactions to the investigation of three - hadron systems using the faddeev equations .",
    "this formalism has been applied to study many different three - body systems made of mesons and baryons and has brought out , for the first time , the three - body nature of several resonances @xcite .",
    "for example , the study of systems like @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc .",
    ", has revealed the dynamical generation of all the known @xmath44 baryon states listed by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , some @xmath35 resonances , like the @xmath45 @xcite , as well as some of the recent meson states observed in the experiments , like @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "going back to the kaonic systems , one can summarize that so far the well studied few - hadron systems constituted by anti - kaons and nucleons are : @xmath13 , @xmath15 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "of the different states generated in these systems , the most peculiar probably are the @xmath14 , due to its double pole nature , and the @xmath48 , which is formed when the @xmath14 is dynamically generated in the @xmath49 subsystem and coupled channels and , at the same time , the @xmath12 subsystem and coupled channels give rise to the @xmath5 or @xmath6 states .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the attraction present in the @xmath13 subsystem in isospin zero and @xmath12 in isospin zero or one is strong enough to compensate the repulsion in the @xmath50 subsystem and , thus , form a @xmath33 bound state .",
    "the question which arises now is what will happen if instead of a nucleon we add a kaon to the @xmath12 system .",
    "now , the different @xmath12 interactions can lead to the simultaneous presence of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 resonances in two of the subsystems , such that these interactions could be strong enough to overcome the @xmath11 repulsion and form a @xmath1 bound state or resonance .",
    "recently , two - body systems of @xmath51 and @xmath52 have been studied @xcite using an extended version of the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and a resonant peak is found at 1460 mev with 100 mev of width and total isospin @xmath53 . however , some remarks concerning the model used in ref .",
    "@xcite have been made in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the possibility to form a three - body state in the @xmath0 system by means of the three - body faddeev formulation developed in refs .",
    "one of the advantages of the present three - body formulation is that all the parameters involved in the approach are related to the two - body subsystems ( typically a cut - off or a subtraction constant to regularize the two - body loops ) .",
    "thus , we can focus on the investigation of the three - body hadron dynamics without introducing new adjustable parameters .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows : in sec .",

    "( [ bs ] ) is obtained by taking into account all possible two - body channels of two mesons ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) which couple to @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath11 , except for the @xmath73 channel , whose effect in the @xmath74 amplitude is negligible  @xcite .",

    "equation  ( [ trest ] ) is an algebraic coupled equation since it involves only the on - shell part of the two - body @xmath4-matrices .",
    "this is due to the finding of a cancellation between the contribution of the off - shell parts of the chiral two - body @xmath4-matrices to the three - body faddeev amplitudes and a contact term with same topology whose origin is in the chiral lagrangian used to describe the interaction .",
    "it was found in the three - body system of two pseudoscalar mesons and one baryon or one vector meson that this cancellation becomes exact in the flavor su(3 ) limit  @xcite , and that in a realistic case off the su(3 ) limit the sum of the off - shell part and the three - body contact term was estimated to be smaller than @xmath111 of the total on - shell contribution .",

    "first of all , we see in both panels of fig .",
    "[ n1 ] a peak structure at an energy around @xmath156 mev ( with @xmath134 = 496 mev the kaon mass ) which appears when the invariant masses of the respective @xmath12 subsystems have a value around @xmath157 , i.e. , their threshold values . if we only considerer @xmath2 and @xmath3 as coupled channels , the signal at 1488 mev is not present .",
    "thus , we conclude that the peak which shows up at 1488 mev corresponds then to the opening of the three - body @xmath1 threshold .",
    "apart from this trivial structure , we find a peak at @xmath158 mev and a width of @xmath159 50 mev when @xmath160 mev , as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ n1 ] . as it can be seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ n1 ] , this resonance state also shows up for a value of @xmath161 around @xmath162 mev and @xmath158 mev .",
    "these two peaks correspond to a single state with a mass @xmath163 1420 mev which can be interpreted as a quasibound state of the @xmath1 system with one of the @xmath12 pairs forming the @xmath5 : the resonance shows up when the invariant mass of the @xmath12 pair with isospin zero is close to a value of 983 mev .",
    "this means that the @xmath5 resonance is formed in the subsystem .",
    "however , when the @xmath12 is projected on @xmath152 , the invariant mass for the @xmath12 pair has a value around 950 mev .",
    "this value is not exactly in the region where the @xmath6 gets dynamically generated , but it is also not very far away is localized on the complex plane at a real value of the energy near 1009 mev , the peak corresponding to this state on the real plane appears around 980 mev . ] , and the attraction present in the system helps in forming a three - body bound state .",
    "therefore , for the state found around a total energy of 1420 mev , both attractions of @xmath12 with isospin 0 ( and in which the @xmath5 is generated ) and 1 are important to form the three - body quasibound state .",
    "this is a similar situation to the three - body resonance state @xmath164 found in the @xmath165 system  @xcite , in which the state is generated by the attraction in @xmath26 and @xmath12 .",
    "the state obtained in the @xmath1 system and coupled channels can probably correspond to the @xmath10 listed by the pdg @xcite ( which is omitted from the summary table ) and observed in @xmath2 partial wave analysis , although the width found in this work is much smaller than the two values listed by the pdg , around 250 mev .",
    "note , however , that the width obtained within this formalism comes only from s - wave three - body channels and , normally , is smaller than the total width observed for that state to which the two - body decay widths also contribute , even if these two - body channels have a smaller weight in the resonance wave function , as implicitly assumed in our study .",
    "for example , the inclusion of @xmath166-wave channels , like @xmath167 ( a decay channel observed for the @xmath10 @xcite ) , although it should not be essential to generate the state found , could definitively help in increasing the width obtained .",
    "however , the poor experimental information available in this energy region for kaonic states suggests that the values of the widths in ref .",
    "@xcite may not be very precise .    to understand further the structure of the resonance found at 1420 mev",
    ", we have studied the effect of the different three - body coupled channels calculating the three - body @xmath122 amplitude taking into account the @xmath1 channel and excluding @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the three - body space matrices of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 systems we continue considering all the two - body coupled channels , except for the @xmath73 channel as done before . ] . in this calculation , we get again a peak in the @xmath1 amplitude around @xmath158 mev for total isospin @xmath8 with one of the @xmath12 pairs forming the @xmath5 and the other not very far away from the region where the @xmath6 gets generated and with a magnitude in @xmath139 similar to the result obtained with the full set of coupled channels . if the @xmath1 channel is excluded and the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels are considered as coupled channels , the corresponding peak is found around 1450 mev ( a bit higher than the resonance position of the full calculation ) for total isospin @xmath53 .",
    "however its signal is much weaker than that of the full calculation .",
    "this fact suggests that for the state found in the @xmath1 system and coupled channels around 1420 mev the @xmath168 resonance plays an important role in determining the resonance position , because the @xmath21 channel couples weakly to the @xmath168 in the two - body dynamics as compared to the @xmath12 channel and without the @xmath12 channel the @xmath168 resonance can not participate strongly in the three - body dynamics . nevertheless , since there is still some attraction from the @xmath22 channel in the ( 23 ) subsystem with @xmath152 to form the @xmath169 resonance , one can still find a weak signal for the state , although the @xmath1 channel essentially determines the structure of this resonance .",
    "finally , it is rewarding to mention that in our calculation of the three - body system with total isospin @xmath170 , which is manifestly exotic and can not be made up with a @xmath171 configuration , we do not find any resonance state in the studied energy region : for total isospin @xmath170 , the two - body subsystems present in the @xmath1 system have substantially large isospin 1 components .",
    "in the @xmath11 subsystem the isospin 1 configuration is repulsive in nature , while for @xmath74 , although the isospin 1 configuration is attractive , the interaction is not as strong as when the @xmath22 channel is also present to generate together the @xmath169 resonance .",
    "thus , for total isospin @xmath172 , in the @xmath1 system , the @xmath74 interaction in isospin 1 probably is not strong enough to overcome the repulsion originated from the @xmath11 interaction in isospin 1 and form a resonance or a bound state . for this reason , states with total isospin @xmath170 are probably hard to be generated dynamically in the three - body system .",
    "as we have seen in sec .  [ re ] , the state found around an energy of @xmath7 mev in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 system couples more strongly to @xmath1 than to @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "this fact , together with the smallness of the kinetic energy of the kaons in a bound system in comparison with the kaon mass , makes possible the study of the single channel @xmath1 using a nonrelativistic potential model , like the one developed in refs .",

    "it is interesting to notice that although the two methods are very different , the energy position of the quasibound @xmath1 state does not differ very much .",
    "note , however , that in the potential model used we consider only the single @xmath1 channel and do not take into account the possible modification of the two - body interaction in the presence of the third particle . in such simple calculation , for weakly bound systems ,",
    "the resulting binding energy and width correspond to the sum of the binding energies and widths of the two - body subsystems , @xmath168 and @xmath169 in the present case , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the potential model",
    ", the three - body wave function is also obtained . with the wave function",
    "we can investigate the spacial structure of the three - body quasibound state .",
    "we obtain the root mean squared radius of the @xmath1 quasibound state to be 1.6 fm .",
    "this value is similar to the one found for the @xmath165 system  @xcite , which was 1.7 fm .",
    "the average @xmath16-@xmath16 distance and the distance between the @xmath11 cluster and @xmath17 are calculated and found to be 2.8 fm and 1.7 fm , respectively .",
    "the distance of the repulsive @xmath11 is also very similar to the corresponding result for the @xmath50 distance in the @xmath165 system .    in the calculation",
    ", we have taken three jacobian coordinates of the @xmath205 system , @xmath202-@xmath206 , @xmath200-@xmath207 and @xmath208-@xmath209 . even without the @xmath208-@xmath209 rearrangement channel , we obtain almost the same three - body binding energy .",
    "this means that the system can be described essentially by the @xmath202-@xmath210-@xmath207 configuration . since the @xmath25-wave configuration of @xmath204 with @xmath211",
    "is not allowed because of bose statistics , the @xmath204 subsystem has almost @xmath212 . in case that the @xmath204 subsystem has purely @xmath212 , according with the isospin algebra , the @xmath74 subsystem",
    "should be composed by isospin 0 and 1 in a ratio of 3:1 for total isospin @xmath8 of the @xmath1 system .",
    "calculating the distances of @xmath200-@xmath208 and @xmath202-@xmath206 without the symmetrization of @xmath202 and @xmath200 , we obtain 1.6 fm and 2.6 fm , respectively . a schematic picture is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : struc ] .",
    "these facts indicate that the @xmath1 quasibound system can be interpreted as a system of one @xmath16 and a strongly correlated @xmath74 pair forming dominantly the @xmath168 .",
    "this feature is consistent with what we have found for the @xmath1 resonant state in the faddeev calculation .",
    "it is also worth noting that the attraction of @xmath12 in isospin 1 is essential to make the interaction between @xmath16 and @xmath5 attractive enough to form a quasibound state .",
    "actually when we do not include attraction in @xmath74 with isospin 1 , we find no bound state for the @xmath1 system .",
    "quasibound state before making the symmetrization of @xmath202 and @xmath200 .",
    "[ fig : struc ] ]    here we emphasize an important role of the repulsive @xmath11 interaction for the hadronic molecular states .",
    "one of the crucial features of the hadronic molecular state is that the system can be described by its hadronic constituents .",
    "therefore , if a quasibound state is formed in the hadronic system , it should be such a loosely bound state that the constituents hadrons are separated and keeping their identities inside the bound state .",
    "for deeply bound states , such as ones with hundreds of mev binding energy , the constituent hadrons get close to each other and may be overlapped .",
    "in such a case , the hadronic molecular picture may be broken down for these states and , if such states exist in nature one has to interpret them by other mechanisms than the hadronic molecular picture . in the present @xmath1 system , @xmath11 with isospin 1 has a repulsion , and this keeps the @xmath1 system loosely bound with a moderate binding energy .",
    "when we take an artificial attraction for the @xmath11 interaction as strong as the @xmath12 interaction , we obtain a very deeply bound state with hundreds of mev binding energy .",
    "thus , for a hadronic molecular state appearing near the threshold of the system , it is necessary that one of the pairs has a repulsive interaction or , at least , sufficiently weak attraction .",
    "because in this calculation we have considered the same potential for the cases @xmath213 and @xmath214 , for total isospin @xmath170 we obtain a quasibound state at the same energy as the one found for total isospin @xmath8 .",
    "however , the origin of this state is in the use of an isospin independent @xmath12 interaction in the potential model : although the @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances can be considered as bound states of the @xmath12 system for isospin 0 and 1 , respectively , at almost the same energy , one should also consider some non - resonant contributions , as done in the faddeev calculation , which certainly makes the @xmath12 interaction in isospin 0 different from the one in isospin 1 , resulting , as shown in sec .",
    "[ re ] , in no quasibound state in the @xmath1 system for total isospin 3/2 .",
    "we have studied the @xmath1 system and coupled channels solving the faddeev equations within an unitary chiral approach to describe the interaction between the different subsystems . a resonance state around 1420 mev , thus below the @xmath1 threshold , which couples dominantly to the @xmath1 channel , is found when one of the @xmath12 pairs is in isospin zero generating the resonance @xmath5 and the other one is in isospin 1 , not very far from the region where the @xmath6 is generated .",
    "a non - relativistic potential model has been also employed to study the @xmath1 channel and similar results to those of the faddeev approach has been obtained .",
    "a state of these characteristics could be probably observed in processes involving a final state of three particles like @xmath1 , as an enhancement of the cross section close to threshold due to the presence of the quasibound @xmath1 state below it , by taking coincidence of the @xmath5 out of the invariant masses of the @xmath12 pairs . and also in processes involving final states like @xmath2 or @xmath3 ,",
    "although the coupling to these channels is much smaller and it can be more difficult to find the state .    the resonance state obtained in the @xmath1 system",
    "can be an analog state of the quasibound states found in @xmath165  @xcite , in @xmath215  @xcite and in @xmath216  @xcite .",
    "these states are found to be loosely bound in the systems of kaons and nucleons .",
    "the significant similarity among these systems stems from the fact that the two - body @xmath74 and @xmath26 systems with isospin 0 have sufficient attraction to form loosely bound states with a dozen mev binding energy .",
    "this is because , although kaons and nucleons , having different masses , are kinematically different , the fundamental interactions among @xmath12 and @xmath26 in @xmath25-wave at low energy are determined by current algebra as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry in qcd , and the strengths of these interactions are identical in the sense of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry being enough to make a bound state  @xcite .",
    "even though the attractions in the two - body subsystems are important to form three - body quasibound states in kaonic nuclear systems , some repulsive interaction or sufficiently weak attraction in one of the two - body subsystems is necessary to form a hadronic molecular state .",
