    "among the motivations for studying perturbative qcd at high energy are : ( i ) to test qcd as a quantum field theory and as a component of the standard model ; ( ii ) to infer the presence of phenomena beyond the standard model through deviations from its predictions and ( iii ) to understand backgrounds from qcd to signals of new particles or nonstandard interactions .",
    "all of these , but expecially ( ii ) when the deviation from standard model predictions is modest , require us to use qcd as a precision tool .",
    "hints of such deviations that are on everyone s mind right now are in the running of @xmath0 , in @xmath1 , and in very high-@xmath2 jets . whether they persist or",
    "not , these examples all suggest the need to further improve the theory .",
    "such improvements will require control over a class of corrections associated with what is often called  partonic threshold \" , or more accurately the elastic limit in partonic hard scatttering .",
    "they appear first at next - to - leading order in hard - scattering cross sections , and recur in all orders .",
    "this talk will describe the nature of these corrections , and report on some progress @xcite in their resummation to all orders in perturbation theory .    before going further , we may distinguish two scenarios for the phenomenological application of resummed cross sections .",
    "corrections due to resummation may turn out to be small , in which case our confidence in low - order perturbative cross sections should increase , and our ability to detect new physics through deviations from qcd predictions should improve . or",
    ", they may turn out to be large , and may afford tests of qcd , and indeed of quantum field theory , in a new regime , where all orders of perturbation theory are relevant .",
    "it is possible that both scenarios apply in different cross sections .",
    "it s a  win - win \" situation .",
    "we begin by reviewing a few facts about the calculation of hard - scattering cross sections in perturbative qcd .",
    "we will be interested in inclusive cross sections at large momentum transfer through strong interactions . in such cross sections we sum over all final states that include a particular heavy system @xmath3 , which can only be produced by a short - distance process in partonic scattering .",
    "outstanding examples of @xmath3 are a top - antitop pair , or a pair of jets at very high transverse momentum .",
    "we suppose for simplicity that the total mass @xmath4 of the system @xmath3 is of order @xmath5 , the total ( hadronic ) center of mass energy squared , and that the rapidity @xmath6 of the produced system is not large .",

    "we will be interested in the elastic limit ( see below ) , or partonic threshold of this function .",
    "two- ( and sometimes even three- ) loop corrections of this sort are also known in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan ( dy ) cross sections @xcite .",

    "this is what we shall refer to as the  elastic limit \" , or  partonic threshold \" .",
    "it is important to distinguish partonic threshold from the usual concept of a threshold .",
    "in particular , in heavy quark production , we shall assume that the heavy quarks of mass @xmath15 are produced with nonzero velocity @xmath16 , and hence with a total invariant mass @xmath17 .",
    "thus , only for @xmath18 does partonic threshold coincide with true threshold . for the drell - yan production of highly relativistic lepton pairs with @xmath19 ,",
    "partonic threshold still refers to @xmath14 , and is the source of potentially large corrections .",
    "typical hard - scattering cross sections are distributions in the variable @xmath20 rather than simply functions of @xmath20 , because they include contributions from virtual as well as real gluons .",
    "we are interested in a class of large , positive corrections due to such distributions that occur in all @xmath21 .",
    "let us explain in what sense they are ",
    "large \" , and why they are positive to all orders .    at order @xmath22 , the leading logarithmic distributions in eq.([basicfact ] ) are of the form @xcite -_s^nn ! _ + , [ lln ] whose integral with a smooth function @xmath23 ( such as the convolution of parton distributions in eq .",

    "if they had alternating signs , these contributions might add up to a finite number somehow , but they are all of the same sign",
    ".      why are these corrections positive , and hence potentially dangerous ?",
    "their sign comes directly from the manner in which hard - scattering cross sections are computed .",
    "the fully inclusive drell - yan cross section @xmath26 illustrates the situation .",
    "the computation of its hard - scattering function is easiest to understand in terms of moments , because eq .  ( [ basicfact ] )",
    "factors into simple products of functions under moments with respect to @xmath27 , ( n ) _",
    "0 ^ 1 d^n-1d_dy()dq^2 . neglecting parton labels , the moment @xmath28 is the ratio of moments of the cross section to the product of moments of parton distributions . because @xmath9 is , by construction , dependent only on short - distance behavior ,",
    "this ratio may be computed in perturbation theory , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ mtratio ] ( for the dis scheme ) .",
    "the numerator is a moment of the perturbative partonic drell - yan cross section , while the denominator is the product of moments of two perturbative parton distributions . for quark - antiquark processes ,",
    "the parton distributions are the same , so the denominator is the square of squared partonic amplitudes , summed over final states .    at each order both the numerator and denominator in fig .",
    "[ mtratio ] have double - logarithmic terms like eq .",
    "( [ lln ] ) .",
    "all logarithmically - diverent integrals over gluon transverse momenta cancel in the ratio by the standard factorization theorems . before moments ,",
    "the perturbative drell - yan cross sections include logarithmic distributions in @xmath29 , like eq .",
    "( [ lln ] ) above , while in the deeply inelastic scattering cross section the same sort of distributions depend on bjorken @xmath30 through @xmath31 .",
    "after moments , both give double - logarithmic @xmath32 at @xmath25th order , with @xmath33 the moment variable .",
    "these leading logarithms are the finite remainders of corrections from @xmath25 pairs of real and virtual gluons that attach to the scattered quarks in dis and the annihilating pair in dy .",
    "now , in the denominator , each dis parton distribution , which is itself of the form of a cross section , has both incoming _ and _ outgoing quarks , while in the numerator , dy involves incoming quarks only . simply counting quarks",
    ", we discover that the coefficients of the double logs are @xmath34 times larger in the denominator than in the numerator at @xmath25th order . at the same time , both numerator and denominator have _ alternating signs _ for their leading logarithms .",
    "the reason for this may be seen by recalling the relations of @xmath20 and @xmath30 to the invariant mass @xmath35 of hadrons in the final state for the two cases : & : & w^2~q^2(1-z)^2 , + dis & : & w^2~q^2(1-x ) .",
    "[ wsquared ] the limits @xmath36 and @xmath37 thus both correspond to nearly elastic scattering : for drell - yan , the annihilation of a quark pair into an electroweak vector boson , for dis , the scattering of a quark into a nearly massless jet of particles . in a gauge theory like qcd , the alternating - sign distributions in either cross section sum up to give sudakov suppression in the elastic limit .",
    "the perturbative theory simply will not allow the annihilation or hard - scattering of isolated colored particles without copious radiation .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that in these limits , the partonic cross section is suppressed by a factor that decays faster than any fixed power of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "indeed , in these limits , we expect the coherent scattering of hadronic bound states , whose contributions are normally suppressed by a power of @xmath4 compared to incoherent partonic scattering , to dominate .    as a result of the extra suppression in dis , due to outgoing quarks , when the hard - scattering function @xmath9 , fig .",
    "[ mtratio ] is computed in perturbation theory , the dis denominator is suppressed even more than the dy numerator",
    ". then the ratio actually grows with moment @xmath33 , from the elastic limit in @xmath20 space .",
    "this is the source of the terms shown in eq .",
    "( [ lln ] ) in @xmath9 , and is the reason why they all have the same sign .      for drell - yan and other hard - scattering cross sections the summation of leading singular distributions in @xmath29 is most easily carried out in moment space , where we find @xcite , _ 0 ^ 1 d^nd_dy()dq^2 ~ .",
    "( an equivalent relation holds at fixed rapidity @xcite . ) the moments , however , require integrals all the way to @xmath38 , which implies @xmath39 at fixed @xmath40 . in the cross section itself , which is an inverse moment",
    ", the fixed total energy keeps gluon emission kinematically linked , and we may expect the inverse transform to be rather better behaved when nonleading as well as leading contributions are taken into account . and",
    "indeed , recent estimates of the drell - yan cross section based on this approach to resummation give predictions which are just a few percent ( at most ) above the exact two - loop results for fixed target energies .",
    "there has been considerable ( but perhaps not yet enough ) discussion in the literature on just what is the best way to define and invert a resummed cross section @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most of these issues are well - illustrated by the drell - yan case .",
    "the resummed drell - yan cross section is the benchmark example for the resummation of singular distributions .",
    "as above , singular distributions at @xmath14 translate into logarithms of the moment variable @xmath33 .",
    "logarithms of @xmath33 ( to all logarithmic order , not just leading or next - to - leading logarithm ) in the moments of the inclusive drell - yan cross section exponentiate @xcite ,",

    "the resummed integrals , however , are ill - defined for @xmath37 , no matter how large @xmath40 is , since the one - loop running coupling @xmath46 diverges at @xmath47 .",
    "such a divergence is called an  infrared renormalon \" .",
    "the problem of infrared renormalons in resummed cross sections @xcite takes its place alongside the divergence identified above due to sudakov logarithms as an object of lively interest .",
    "this is not , however , the subject of this talk .",

    "rather , we will report below on how the resummation of drell - yan cross sections in eqs .",
    "( [ dyexp ] ) and ( [ dyexponent ] ) may be generalized to include all logarithmic order in cross sections like heavy quark or high-@xmath2 jet production , which are initiated by qcd hard - scattering .",
    "this problem is distinguished from drell - yan by the complications of final - state radiation , and by color exchange in the hard - scattering , which is no longer based upon an electroweak interaction .",
    "over the past few years the one - loop - corrected jet cross section @xmath48 has become an almost proverbial success for perturbative qcd , tracking the data to a few tens of percent ( depending on the parton distributions ) while it changes over many orders of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , recent experimental results have afforded a stimulus to study yet higher orders in qcd cross sections , particularly in terms of the elastic limit .",
    "partly , this has come from the desire for resummations in heavy quark production [ 12 - 15 ] , but even more strikingly , from the suggestion of an excess of events at the very highest jet @xmath2 .",
    "thus far , resummations for top production have included leading logarithms in the singular distributions , through the function @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ dyexponent ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the leading logarithms are the same for drell - yan as for top , and even high-@xmath2 jet , production .",
    "resummations for gluons may be included by simply changing @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite on the one hand , and ref .",
    "@xcite on the other , start from the same resummation in moment space , but differ in their treatment of the @xmath51 transform . beyond leading logarithms",
    ", however , there may be important differences between the electroweak - induced drell yan cross sections and the qcd - induced top or jet cross sections .",
    "these are due primarily to the presence of final - state radiation from scattered quarks in the latter case , which is absent in the former , and to the interplay of color exchange in the hard scattering with the soft radiation .",
    "an exploration of the details of resummation in processes based on a qcd born cross section , such as heavy quark and jet production , requires more time than we can devote here . as in the case of drell - yan ( [ dyexp ] )",
    ", resummation is based first of all on the factorization properties of the cross section in the neighborhood of the elastic limit @xcite .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hs ] . near the elastic limit ,",
    "all gluons emitted into the final state have energies limited by @xmath52 .",
    "correspondingly , gluons with energies of order @xmath4 can appear only in virtual states .",
    "standard factorization methods may then be used to separate the ( relatively soft but still perturbative ) soft gluons from the underlying hard scattering .",
    "we emphasize that this may be done order - by - order in perturbation theory , and that both the factorized hard and soft components of @xmath9 remain free of soft and collinear divergences .",
    "the process of factorization may be thought of as the construction of an  effective field theory \" @xcite for soft gluons in the presence of the hard scattering .",
    "the hard - scattering function @xmath9 thus breaks up into a product of hard and soft functions . in the relevant effective field theory ,",
    "the incoming partons that annihilate into the heavy quarks and the outgoing heavy quarks themselves are represented by ordered exponentials ( wilson lines ) in the directions of the partons they represent .",
