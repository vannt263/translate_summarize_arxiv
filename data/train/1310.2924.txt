    "the study of heavy flavour ( charm or bottom ) production in proton - proton collisions at the lhc ( large hadron collider ) is an important testing ground for perturbative qcd calculations in a new energy domain .",
    "charmed hadrons may be produced in @xmath4 collisions either directly or as feed - down from the decay of excited charm resonances .",
    "they may also be produced in weak decays of b - hadrons .",
    "the first two sourses ( direct production and feed - down from higher mass resonances ) are usually referred to as prompt production . charmed particles from @xmath5-hadron decays",
    "are called secondary charmed hadrons or @xmath6-feed - down charmed hadrons .",
    "prompt charmed hadron production cross sections were measured in the central rapidity region @xmath7 in @xmath8 collisions at the fermilab tevatron collider at @xmath9 @xcite and in the central rapidity region @xmath10 in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath11 @xcite and at @xmath12 @xcite and in the forward rapidity region @xmath13 @xcite at the cern lhc .",
    "in addition , charmed hadron production cross section measurements in which prompt production and @xmath6-feed - down production have not been separated , were reported by the atlas collaboration @xcite at the lhc .",
    "perturbative calculations of these charmed hadron production cross section at next - to - leading order based on the general mass variable flavour number scheme ( gm - vfns ) @xcite and on the fixed order with next - to - leading - logarithmic resummation ( fonll ) @xcite reproduce the measured cross sections @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that in the near future prompt charmed hadron production and production from weak decays of @xmath6 meson could be well separated and that the production cross section for @xmath6-feed - down production could be measured .",
    "actually in the case of inclusive lepton production from heavy hadron decays such a separation has been achieved . in two experiments",
    "the inclusive leptonic production cross section is measured separately for solely @xmath5-hadron decays @xcite . in particular , in the alice measurement @xcite the production cross section of electrons from",
    "semileptonic bottom hadron decays was selected by using the information on the distance of the secondary decay vertex displaced in space from the primary collision vertex .",
    "it might be possible to apply this technique also in other decays of bottom hadrons , as for example , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is any charmed meson , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "the calculation of the charm hadron production from inclusive @xmath6 decay into these charm hadron can be done in two ways .",
    "either one uses fragmentation functions ( ffs ) for the fragmentation process @xmath21 , where @xmath15 is one of the charmed mesons . such ffs have been constructed in the past from data on @xmath22 and will be described in more details in the next section . the other way is to calculate the inclusive cross section @xmath23 , where @xmath6 is anyone of the bottom mesons @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 or its antiparticles and then convolute this cross section with the inclusive spectrum of @xmath14 , which is known from measurements of the cleo collaboration at cesr , the cornell electron storage ring @xcite , similar as we did for the inclusive production of leptons from semileptonic @xmath6 decays @xcite . for this calculation",
    "one needs the ffs for @xmath2 , which are knwon from the work in @xcite and which we shall use . instead of using the experimental information on the inclusive spectrum of @xmath27 one could think of calculating this spectrum and compare it with the cleo data @xcite .",
    "first attempts in this direction have been done quite some time ago by wirbel and wu @xcite much earlier than the cleo data had appeared .",
    "unfortunately this comparison of models as the one proposed in @xcite to the cleo data has not been done so far .",
    "therefore we shall rely in our calculations on the empirical d meson spectrum from b decay as measured in @xcite .",
    "after convolution with the @xmath28 ffs one obtains the ffs for @xmath29 .",
    "this is an alternative method for calculationg these ffs , which is essentally based on the @xmath28 ffs from @xmath30 annihilation data obtained at lep and slc .",
    "of course it depends on the tagging of charmed mesons by cleo at the @xmath31 resonance as opposed to the direct measurements of these mesons performed by the lep experiments at the @xmath32 resonance to be described in the next section .. the main difference of the two approaches is the tagging of the @xmath15 mesons at the two energies , the cleo energy at @xmath33 gev versus the lep energy @xmath34 .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows . in section [ two ]",
    "we describe the input choices of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and @xmath6- and @xmath15-meson ffs . in this section",
    "we also explain how the fragmentation of @xmath6 into @xmath15 mesons has been obtained from the cleo data . in section",
    "[ three ] we present our predictions of the gm - vfn scheme for the cross sections @xmath35 for the four cases : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in addition we give the corresponding cross sections where the fragmentation functions @xmath36",
    ", @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been used in terms of ratios to the cross sections for prompt production based on the ffs for @xmath37 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 and compare the ratios for the two approaches of calculating the inclusive @xmath15 meson production cross sections from bottom quarks .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper are performed in the theoretical framework of the gm - vfns approach for @xmath4 collisions which has been presented in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we describe our choice of input for the calculation of inclusive production of various @xmath15 meson species originating from bottom quarks . for the ingoing protons we use the pdf set cteq@xmath38 @xcite as implemented in the lhapdf library @xcite .",
    "this pdf set was obtained in the general - mass scheme using the input mass values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and for the qcd strong coupling @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42- and the @xmath5-quark pdfs have the starting scale @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the nonperturbative ffs for the transition @xmath2 needed for the approach where @xmath15 production is calculated from @xmath6 decay to @xmath15 mesons , were obtained by a fit to @xmath30 annihilation data from the aleph @xcite , opal @xcite and sld @xcite collaborations and have been published in @xcite .",
    "the combined fit to the three data sets was done using the nlo sclae parameter @xmath45 which corresponds to @xmath46 adopted from @xcite .",
    "consistent with the chosen pdf , the starting scale of the @xmath2 ff was assumed to be @xmath44 , while the @xmath47 ffs , where @xmath48 denotes the light quarks including the charm quark , are assumed to vanish at @xmath49 .",
    "indeed their contribution is very small since they appear only via the evolution of the ffs to larger scales . as input we used the ffs with a simple power ansatz which gave the best fit to the experimental data .",
    "the bottom mass in the hard scattering cross sections is @xmath50 as it is used in the pdf cteq@xmath38 and in the ffs for @xmath2 .    for comparison with the results for the prompt production and for calculating the ratios of the various contributions ,",
    "we also need the ffs for the transitions @xmath37 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 which we take from @xcite .",
    "there we used the so - called global - gm fit which includes fitting in addition to the opal data @xcite together with the most precise data on @xmath15 meson production from the cleo collaboration at cesr @xcite and from the belle collaboration at kekb @xcite .",
    "the fits in @xcite , which by including the opal data from lep@xmath53 , yield also the ffs for @xmath0.they are based on the charm mass @xmath54 , which is slightly larger than the one used in the cteq@xmath38 pdfs .",
    "the starting scale for @xmath55 is @xmath43 , as it is for the @xmath56 ffs , whereas for the @xmath0 ff it is @xmath44 .",

    "the theoretical accuracy of the theoretical prediction is estimated by calculating the cross sections with varying renormalization and factorization scales @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , denoting the renormalization and the factorization scales of initial and final state singularities respectively .",
    "we choose the scales to be of order @xmath60 , where @xmath60 is the transverse mass @xmath61 with @xmath62 for the case of the bottom quark and @xmath63 for charm quark production . for exploiting the freedom in the choice of scales",
    "we have introduced the scale parameters @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) by @xmath66 .",
    "we vary as usual the values of the @xmath64 s independently by a factor of two up and down while keeping any ratio of the @xmath64 parameters smaller than or equal to two .",
    "the uncertainties due to the scale variation are dominant .",
    "therefore pdf related uncertainties and variations of the bottom and charm mass are not considered .",

    "we studied this effect in our earlier work on the inclusive lepton spectra in @xmath6 decays @xcite and we found a very negligible effect on the spectra .",

    "the exact formula for @xmath108 as given in @xcite is rather difficult to evaluate since @xmath76 depends on @xmath74 and the rapidity @xmath75 of the produced @xmath15 meson .",
    "therefore , as in our previous work @xcite we applied for @xmath108 the asymptotic formula , also given in @xcite .",

    "the cross section for the @xmath137 final state is larger than the other three due to the larger branching fractions for @xmath138 than , for example , for @xmath139 .",
    "the cross sections @xmath116 for the final states @xmath140 and @xmath141 are also slightly different due to the different branching fractions for @xmath142 and @xmath143 and differences in the spectral shapes as can be seen in fig .",

    "these cross sections are the same as those presented in @xcite , which have been compared there to the alice experimental data @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ratio ] as the upper curves : full for the default and dotted curves for the maximal and minimal result . for better visibility these ratios",

    "the shape of this ratio as a function of @xmath74 for @xmath158 is similar as for the case of the two - step ffs : @xmath149 .",
    "the only significant differences are the absolute values of the ratios . at the largest @xmath74",
    "the ratios for @xmath159 are approximately between @xmath160 and @xmath161 smaller than the ratios for @xmath162 shown as the lower curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the reason for this decrease is not caused by a mismatch of the branching ratios .",
    "indeed , for example , in the case @xmath163 the total branching ratio is approximatel @xmath164 in good agreement with the branching ratio for @xmath36 equal to @xmath165 as given in table 11 of @xcite and similarly for the other channels .",
    "therfore the reason for the differeent ratio in the upper and lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] must lie in the shape of the ffs .",
    "the ffs in the two approaches have a similar shape of approximately gaussian form with a maximum near @xmath166 .",
    "first we should ask , however , why the cross section @xmath116 is so much smaller for @xmath1 than the one for @xmath167 as already clearly seen in fig . [",
    "fig : main ] .",
    "to answer this question we calculated the average @xmath168 as a function of @xmath74 in the relevant region of @xmath74 .",
    "this @xmath169 is the quantity @xmath170 where @xmath168 is the scaling variable of the respective ffs .",
    "it is understood that the integration of the quantities of the numerator and of the denominator is done over the the rapidity interval @xmath171 .",
    "the range of @xmath172 s for the four cases @xmath173 and @xmath19 is in the @xmath74 range @xmath174 gev equal to @xmath175,[0.45,0.50],[0.35,0.45]$ ] and @xmath176 $ ] .",
    "this means that the relevant @xmath168 range , where the ffs contribute to @xmath116 , lie outside the maximum of the ffs on the right side , where the ffs decreased already by an aprecciable factor .",
    "the ffs for @xmath167 , on the other hand , have a similar shape with a maximum at @xmath177 @xcite , which is approximately the relevant range for @xmath116 . for example , for @xmath178 we obtain @xmath179 $ ] in the range @xmath180 gev , which is just in the vicinity of the @xmath168 , where the corresponding ff is maximal . from this",
    "we conclude that the smallness of the cross section @xmath116 for @xmath159 s in the considered @xmath74 range is due to the fact that the corresponding ffs contribute only outside the range where the ff is maximal and has decreased already appreciably .    for the one - step ffs",
    "@xmath159 s the average @xmath168 ranges in the cross section @xmath116 are similar as in the two - step process .",
    "the only exception is @xmath181 where @xmath172 ranges in the interval @xmath182 $ ] , which is @xmath183 larger than for the case @xmath184 . , where the corresponding ff is smaller , which has the effect that the cross section @xmath116 is snaller by @xmath161 than for the two- step process as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] . in the other two cases",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath154 it turns out that in the relevant region the one - step ff is smaller than the two - step ff .",

    "in the two - step approach : @xmath162 s we constructed the ffs based on the @xmath187 ff fitted to @xmath6 production data from lep and slc convoluted with ffs for @xmath188 s obtained from measuerements of the cleo collaboration . in the one - step approach we used ffs for @xmath159 , constructed from @xmath30 annihilation cross section for the production of @xmath15 mesons from @xmath5 quarks .    in both approaches the cross section for @xmath189 with @xmath15 s originating from @xmath5 quarks decays",
    "is only a small fraction of the dominant contribution where the @xmath15 mesons come from the fragmentation of charm quarks .",
    "the reason for the reduction of the @xmath190 cross sections as compared to the @xmath191 originates from the fact that in the second case the ff for @xmath167 s contributes in the region of fractional momenta , where the ff is maximal , whereas in the first case the contributing region of the ff is above the maximal region where the ff has decreased aprecciably .",
    "the difference in the cross sections for the one - step and two - step approaches can be explained by the stronger fall - off of the ffs from the one - step approach above the @xmath168 s where the maximum occurs .",
