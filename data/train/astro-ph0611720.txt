    "the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) is an array of four imaging cherenkov telescopes designed to study astrophysical gamma - rays in the energy domain between about 100gev and several tens of tev .",
    "its wide field of view and unprecedented sensitivity in this energy range have allowed the discovery of a large number of new very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray sources .",
    "several of these are associated with pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) ; they will be individually reviewed in section [ established ] , and their general properties discussed .",
    "section [ candidates ] will then examine the criteria for establishing such pwn associations , and discuss individual possible pwn counterparts for unidentified h.e.s.s .",
    "the `` standard candle '' of very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray astronomy will serve to introduce the emission mechanisms at play in pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) . the crab nebula is a bright source of strongly polarised , non - thermal radiation across most of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "this emission , from the radio domain up to high - energy gamma - rays below 1gev , is generally interpreted as synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons and positrons created and accelerated by the central pulsar .",
    "the higher - energy emission component observed in vhe gamma - rays , and by _ egret _ as unpulsed emission above 1gev , is conventionally interpreted as inverse compton ( ic ) scattering by the same accelerated electrons and positrons .",
    "target photons for the scattering process include the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , interstellar dust and stellar emission , and at least in the case of the crab , the synchrotron photons themselves .",
    "hadronic emission models have also been proposed for vhe emission from plerions ( see @xcite ) ; in the present review , however , we will restrict ourselves to the more conservative leptonic models consisting of synchrotron and ic emission components .",
    "observations of the crab nebula with h.e.s.s . have revealed clear evidence for steepening at high energies of the vhe gamma - ray spectrum , which can be described by a power law of photon index @xmath3 with an exponential cutoff energy @xmath4tev @xcite .",
    "such spectral curvature is consistent with expectations from model calculations of the ic emission spectrum .",
    "the crab nebula is the prototype of a purely _ plerionic _",
    "supernova remnant ( snr ) , exhibiting a centre - filled morphology and strongly polarised , non - thermal emission , properties which are characteristic of pwne .",
    "the galactic snr g0.9 + 0.1 is of the more general _",
    "composite _ type , in which such a plerion is found inside the shell of emission due to the supernova blast wave @xcite .",
    "the composite morphology of g0.9 + 0.1 is evident in the radio domain , and x - ray observations confirmed the non - thermal nature of the plerionic emission component .",
    "the pulsar thought to power this pwn has however not been detected up to now , presumably because its beaming is unfavourable .",
    "vhe gamma - ray emission from g0.9 + 0.1 was discovered in deep h.e.s.s .",
    "observations of the galactic centre region @xcite .",
    "the observed gamma - ray excess is well described as a point source at a position consistent with that of the plerion ; given the precise point spread function of h.e.s.s .",
    ", an upper limit of 1.3@xmath5 on the ( assumed gaussian ) source extension was derived .",
    "this argues for the plerion rather than the shell as the counterpart of the vhe source . the available radio , x - ray and vhe gamma - ray spectral data are well described by a simple leptonic model , with a magnetic field inside the plerion of 6@xmath6 g , close to the equipartition value .",
    "the dominant ic target photon component in this model is from stellar photons rather than the cmb , as expected for a source located in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the composite snr msh 155_2 _ , also known as g320.41.2 , comprises an x - ray and radio - emitting shell which encloses a bright , non - thermal x - ray nebula around the young pulsar b150958 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the good angular resolution of h.e.s.s . allowed the discovery of an extended source of vhe gamma - rays in this snr , with a morphology similar to that of the non - thermal x - ray nebula @xcite .",
    "this morphological correspondence , and the fact that the available spectral data can be described by a simple leptonic model with a plerion magnetic field value of @xmath717@xmath6 g , motivate the identification of the pwn as the source of the vhe emission .",
    "this h.e.s.s .",
    "discovery provided the first illustration of the potential for vhe gamma - ray morphological studies of pwne .",
    "the synchrotron emission observed at lower frequencies reflects the spatial distribution of a combination of the accelerated electron density and the magnetic field strength , and the latter can in general be quite non - uniform in pwne . by contrast , in a typical ic emission scenario the target photons are approximately uniformly distributed on the scale of the snr , so that the vhe emission directly reflects the spatial distribution of the high - energy electrons . in the case of msh 155_2",
    "_ , the observed vhe morphology confirms that these electrons are predominantly distributed along a nw - se direction , which is thought to reflect the rotation axis of the pulsar .",
    "the vela snr is a large ( diameter @xmath8 ) , nearby ( distance @xmath9pc ) composite remnant .",
    "it contains a radio - emitting plerionic nebula , vela x , powered by the young and energetic vela pulsar , psrb083345 .",
    "observations of this region with h.e.s.s . revealed a very extended source of vhe gamma - rays centered to the south of the pulsar @xcite , overlapping a diffuse hard x - ray emission feature first detected with _",
    "@xcite and aligned with a bright radio filament within the plerion .    in this pwn , the radio , x - ray and vhe gamma - ray emission regions",
    "are all markedly offset from the pulsar position .",
    "this may be due to the supernova explosion occurring in an inhomogeneous medium , and the resulting asymmetric reverse shock displacing the pwn in the direction away from the higher density medium @xcite .",
    "such an offset may be typical of older pwne ; the vela pulsar has a spin - down age of 11kyr , significantly older than that of the crab ( 1.2kyr ) or b150958 ( 1.7kyr ) .",
    "the vhe gamma - ray spectrum of this source significantly steepens with increasing energy , and can be described by a power law of photon index @xmath10 with an exponential cutoff energy @xmath11tev ; this constitutes the first clear measurement of a peak in the spectral energy distribution at vhe energies @xcite . assuming the cmb is the main target photon component for ic scattering in the outer regions of the galaxy",
    ", a total energy of @xmath12erg in non - thermal electrons between 5tev and 100tev could be deduced .",
    "these results demonstrate how vhe observations of ic emission allow direct inference of the _ spatial _ and _ spectral _ distribution of non - thermal electrons in a pwn .",
    "although the distribution of target photons for ic emission it not uniform in the galaxy , it varies relatively smoothly in contrast to the distribution of target material for hadronic gamma - ray emission processes .",
    "moreover , the cmb provides a minimum target photon density which is uniformly distributed .",
    "sensitive vhe gamma - ray observations should thus reveal any sufficiently intense source of high - energy electrons in the galaxy , again in contrast to sources of high - energy hadrons , for which the presence of dense target material is also a necessary condition for detectability .",
    "the survey of the galactic plane undertaken with h.e.s.s . thus has a strong potential for detecting energetic pwne .    a survey of the galactic plane performed with h.e.s.s . in 2005 ,",
    "in the galactic longitude range @xmath13 , allowed the discovery of two new vhe sources located in the kookaburra complex of radio and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the stronger of the two vhe sources , hessj1420607 , is most plausibly associated with the radio and x - ray nebula of the energetic pulsar psrj14206048 .",
    "the second source , hessj1418609 , is similarly associated with radio and x - ray emission exhibiting the properties of pwn , the so - called rabbit , though a pulsar has so far not been clearly detected in this object @xcite .    in both sources ,",
    "the vhe emission has a large spatial extent and is significantly offset from the pulsar position , which may be due to `` crushing '' of the pwn by the snr reverse shock as hypothesised in the case of vela  x , or perhaps to the effects of rapid motion of the pulsar through the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "both pwne have been proposed as possible counterparts of an unidentified _ egret _ source coincident with the kookaburra complex . the clear separation by h.e.s.s . of two vhe sources ,",
    "coincident with each of the two pwne , illustrates the advantages of good angular resolution in identifying the counterparts of gamma - ray sources .",
    "hessj1825137 is a strong vhe source discovered in the first h.e.s.s .",
    "survey of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "psrb182313 , a pulsar with properties similar to that of vela , lies at its northern edge , and exhibits an asymmetric x - ray nebula extending in the direction of the centre of the vhe source @xcite .",
    "the detected diffuse x - ray emission only extends over @xmath75@xmath5 , however , much smaller than the size of the vhe source .",
    "in contrast to the previously discussed sources , there is no good morphological match of hessj1825137 with emission detected at other wavelengths .",
    "morphological studies of hessj1825137 in the vhe gamma - ray domain have nonetheless yielded compelling evidence for its association with psrb182313 . in particular",
    ", the vhe emission has an asymmetric profile with a sharp peak immediately south of the pulsar position ; the shape of this profile is similar to that of the x - ray nebula , but the vhe profile extends over a much larger scale @xcite .",
    "more importantly , deeper h.e.s.s .",
    "observations have revealed the energy - dependent morphology of hessj1825137 , marking the first time such an effect is detected in vhe gamma - rays .",
    "this manifests itself as a steepening of the power - law spectral index with increasing distance from psrb182313 , as would be expected from radiative losses of high - energy electrons injected by the pulsar @xcite .",
    "these losses could also account for the fact that the pwn appears larger in vhe gamma - rays than in x - rays , as in a leptonic scenario the latter are emitted by higher - energy electrons .",
    "a total of seven fairly well - established associations of vhe gamma - ray sources with pwne have been reviewed in section [ established ] . to these",
    "might be added the vhe emission associated with psrb125963 @xcite .",
    "this object is in a different class from the other pwne and candidate pwne discussed above and below , however , in that it is dominated by the interaction with its binary companion , as evidenced by its orbital variability ; it will thus not be considered further here .    for six of the vhe sources discussed in section [ established ] ,",
    "the association rests on a positional and morphological match to a pwn known at lower energies . when this is not the case , i.e.for hessj1825137 , an alternative criterion is morphological and spectral evidence in the vhe gamma - ray domain for association with a known pulsar , and consistent data at other wavelengths . in all cases ,",
    "another necessary criterion is a physically plausible spectral model which is consistent with the available multi - wavelength ( mwl ) data on the object . in this section",
    "we will examine other candidate associations , for which the above criteria are not currently all fulfilled with the available mwl and vhe data .      when considering the association of a vhe source with the nebula of a known pulsar , an additional criterion is the apparent efficiency for vhe gamma - ray emission , given the pulsar s current spin - down luminosity @xmath14 .",
    "the comparison assumes that the vhe source is located at the pulsar distance @xmath15 , generally determined from the radio dispersion measure . for definiteness",
    ", we use the vhe energy flux @xmath16 integrated over the the energy range 0.330tev .",
    "this is roughly representative of the h.e.s.s .",
    "spectral analysis range , although the energy threshold for individual sources depends on the observation zenith angle , and the upper limit depends on photon statistics .",
    "the apparent efficiency @xmath17 is then defined as @xmath18 .",

    "the pulsar parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 were obtained from the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite , version 1.25 , using the ne2001 model of the galactic free electron distribution for the distance @xcite .",
    "the apparent efficiency reflects the true efficiency only to the extent that the emitting particles lifetimes are short compared with the evolutionary time scale of the pwn . in general the vhe - emitting electrons may have been injected in the early phases of the pwn evolution , when the pulsar s @xmath14 was larger , so that the apparent efficiency is an overestimate of the true efficiency ; this appears to be the case in particular for hessj1825137 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , associations for which the required efficiency approaches 100% may be considered questionable , and those for which it far exceeds this can generally be ruled out as implausible .",
    "in addition to hessj1825137 , two other vhe sources discovered in the initial h.e.s.s .",
    "survey of the galactic plane may be associated with energetic pulsars @xcite .",
    "located near the edge of the bright source hessj1616508 is psrj16175055 , an x - ray emitting young pulsar with a period of 69ms and a spin - down luminosity @xmath27erg / s .",
    "although its association with the vhe source is energetically plausible , the putative wind nebula of this pulsar has not been detected at other wavelengths .",
    "one of the brightest and largest sources discovered in the galactic plane survey , hessj1804216 , contains the young and energetic pulsar b180021 , with spin - down luminosity @xmath28erg / s . as in the previous case ,",
    "an association is energetically plausible , but no coincident pwn has been detected at other wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , the h.e.s.s .",
    "source could be associated with part of the shell - type snr g8.70.1 @xcite .",
    "although hessj1303631 , the first unidentified source discovered by h.e.s.s . , has no established counterpart , it does coincide with the energetic pulsar j13016305 , with spin - down luminosity @xmath29erg / s .",
    "its catalogued distance using the galactic free electron model of taylor and cordes @xcite was @xmath30kpc , which required a very high efficiency of order 40% to power the vhe source @xcite .",
    "the more recent ne2001 model , however , implies a distance of only @xmath31kpc , making the apparent efficiency comparable with that for hessj1825137 ( see table [ eff_candid ] ) .",
    "one additional possible association is with hessj1702420 discovered in the galactic plane survey .",
    "the nearby pulsar j17024128 would require a high but not impossible efficiency to power the entire h.e.s.s source .",

    "the offset of psrj17024128 from the core of hessj1702420 is large , making an association less likely , but it may be that only part of the h.e.s.s .",

    "deeper mwl or vhe observations would be necessary in order to establish any of these candidate associations .",
    "the example of g0.9 + 0.1 shows that h.e.s.s .- discovered sources can be associated with pwne even if the corresponding pulsar has not been detected , in particular when the vhe source is coincident with a composite snr .",
    "another possible such association is with hessj1813178 ; this relatively compact vhe source was discovered in the galactic plane survey @xcite , and was subsequently found to be coincident with a shell - type radio snr , g12.820.02 @xcite , and a bright , non - thermal , hard x - ray source @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution of h.e.s.s . or of the available x - ray data could however not discriminate between the shell and a possible embedded pwn as the source of the respective emission .",
    "a recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of this region shows evidence for a pwn origin of the x - ray emission , suggesting a composite nature for g12.820.02 and the possibility of a pwn origin for the vhe emission @xcite .",
    "another source discovered in the galactic plane survey is hessj1834087 , which is positionally coincident with the radio snr g23.30.3 , also known as w41 .",
    "the vhe source extension appears to be smaller than the radius of the shell , and its position coincides with a region of enhanced radio emission near the centre of the shell @xcite .",
    "this suggests the intriguing possibility that w41 might be a composite snr , and the vhe emission might originate in a central plerion ; more mwl observations of this snr are needed to support such a scenario , however .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the vhe emission is due to hadronic processes and originates in a large molecular cloud associated with w41 , which is in good positional coincidence with the vhe source @xcite .    as a final example , one of the potential counterparts suggested for the galactic survey source hessj1634472 @xcite was the radio snr candidate g337.2 + 0.1 , coincident with an x - ray source detected by _",
    "a recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of this region shows evidence for a pwn origin of the x - ray emission @xcite and raises the possibility of a pwn association for the vhe emission .",
    "the relatively small angular size of this candidate radio and x - ray pwn compared with that of hessj1634472 , and its location near the edge of the vhe excess , nonetheless make an association with the whole of the vhe source unlikely .",
    "of the vhe gamma - ray sources detected by h.e.s.s .",
    ", seven have fairly well - established pwn counterparts , not including the vhe emission associated with psrb125963 .",
    "these currently constitute the most numerous class of identified galactic vhe gamma - ray sources .",
    "several of these vhe - emitting pwne exhibit a large physical extent and are significantly offset from the pulsar position ; one possible explanation is that these are older pwne , strongly affected by the passage of an asymmetric reverse shock in the parent snr .    in a leptonic interpretation of the vhe emission ,",
    "the target photons for ic scattering have an approximately known and uniform density in individual pwne , which allows direct inference of the _ spectral _ and _ spatial _ distribution of the energetic electrons , in contrast to observations of synchrotron emission at lower energies .",
    "vhe gamma - ray astronomy thus provides a new , independent observational window into the physics of pwne .",
    "given smoothly varying galactic target photon densities , and the uniform target density provided by the cosmic microwave background , a survey in vhe gamma - rays should reveal all sufficiently intense galactic sources of high - energy electrons .",
    "four more vhe sources discovered by h.e.s.s . may be associated with known energetic pulsars , and three additional such sources are coincident with possible pwne in which the pulsar has not been detected .",
    "more observations of these sources in vhe gamma - rays and at other wavelengths are necessary to investigate the possibility of these associations .",
