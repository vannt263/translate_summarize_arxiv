    "since the pioneer works of jost and pais in 1951 @xcite and bargmann in 1952 @xcite , the determination of upper and lower limits on the number of bound states of a given potential , having spherical symmetry @xmath4 , in the framework of non relativistic quantum mechanics is still of interest .",
    "a fairly large number of results of this kind can be found in the literature for the schrdinger equation ( see for example @xcite and for results applicable to one and two dimension spaces see for example @xcite )    an important theorem for classifying these results was found by chadan @xcite and gives the asymptotic behavior of the number of @xmath3-wave bound states as the strength , @xmath1 , of the central potential @xmath5 goes to infinity : @xmath6 where the symbol @xmath7 means asymptotic equality , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a generalization of relation ( [ eq0 ] ) ) .",
    "this result implies that any upper and lower limit on @xmath10 which could yield cogent results should behave asymptotically as @xmath11 .",
    "more importantly , the relation ( [ eq0 ] ) gives the functional of the potential , that is to say , the coefficient in front of @xmath11 that appears in the asymptotic behavior .",
    "upper and lower limits on the number of @xmath3-wave bound states featuring the correct @xmath11 dependency was first obtained in ref .",
    "upper and lower limits on @xmath10 featuring the correct asymptotic behavior ( [ eq0 ] ) was first derived in refs .",
    "@xcite . in practice",
    ", the asymptotic regime is reached very quickly when the strength of the potential is large enough to bind two or three bound states .",
    "the situation is completely different when one consider the transition between zero and one bound state .",
    "in contrast to one and two dimension cases where any attractive potential , satisfying adequate integrability conditions , has at least one bound state , in the three dimensional case , the potential acquires a bound state only if it is attractive ( negative ) enough .",
    "thus , for central potential for example , there exists a  critical \" value , @xmath0 , of the coupling constant ( strength ) , @xmath1 , of the potential , @xmath5 , for which a first @xmath3-wave bound state appears .",
    "the determination of this critical value requires to solve the zero energy schrdinger equation @xcite . to circumvent the exact calculation of the jost function at zero energy , upper and lower bounds are very helpful . from now on ,",

    "_ have obtained a strong necessary condition for the existence of a @xmath3-wave bound state in an arbitrary central potential in three dimensions @xcite : @xmath14^p \\geq 1.\\ ] ] this relation yields a lower limit on the critical value @xmath0 , by making a minimization over @xmath15 , which was shown to be very accurate ( see for example @xcite ) .    other necessary conditions for the existence of bound states can be found in the literature ( see for example @xcite and for reviews see @xcite ) , but in general , the relation ( [ eq1 ] ) yields the strongest restriction on @xmath0 ( in some cases , the relations obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite can however be better ) .",
    "sufficient conditions for existence of bound states , yielding upper limits on the critical value of the strength of the potential , are scarcer .",
    "two sufficient conditions for the existence of at least one bound state with angular momentum @xmath3 have been found by calogero in 1965 @xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17^{-1}>1.\\ ] ] these two conditions apply provided the potential is nowhere positive , @xmath18 .",
    "the most stringent conditions obtain by minimizing the left - hand sides of ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) over all positive values of @xmath19 .",
    "some other sufficient conditions for the existence of bound states can been found in the literature ( see for example @xcite and for reviews see @xcite ) . a sufficient condition which does not require the spherical symmetry for the potential @xmath20 was proposed in 1980 by chadan @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . when the potential is central and purely attractive , the inequality : @xmath21 where @xmath22 implies the existence of at least a bound state for the potential @xmath4 . in the case where @xmath4 has some changes of sign , the condition ( [ chad ] ) , is replaced by @xmath23 which implies that one of the potentials @xmath24 has at least one bound state .",
    "recently , an upper limit on the critical strength has been found , originating from a variational technique @xcite : @xmath25^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 which was found to be very accurate .",
    "clearly more accurate upper limits could be obtained but depending strongly on the choice of the trial wave function .",
    "the present article follows a different scheme . to circumvent the difficulty to guess a trial ( strongly potential dependent ) wave function for variational methods we propose upper and lower limits originating from iterative procedures , all designed to converge towards the exact result .",
    "the methods proposed by chadan enter this category of iterative convergent procedures .",
    "also , lassaut and lombard @xcite worked in this sense some years ago , but the procedure was constrained by the condition @xmath30 , which is not verified when the convexity of the potential is too high or when the angular momentum @xmath3 increases .",
    "we thus propose in this article sequences of upper and lower limits of the critical value , @xmath0 , which converge towards the critical coupling constant without any restriction on the possible values of @xmath0 .",
    "the advantage of our procedure , based upon the riesz theorem @xcite in what concerns the upper limits , is that there is no need to start from a conveniently chosen wave function .",
    "indeed , the improvements are simple for these sequences : one just need to calculate the next order .",
    "note that the basic idea of sequences of lower limits for @xmath0 have already been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we derive the upper limits on the critical value @xmath0 . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "the algorithm for generating both lower and upper limits is discussed . in section [ sec4 ] our proposal of upper and lower bounds",
    "are tested against the exact values for common potentials .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "from now on , we assume that @xmath4 is locally integrable and such that @xmath31 remembering that we consider purely attractive potentials namely satisfying @xmath32 . following birman and schwinger @xcite",
    "the critical values of the strength of the potential correspond to the occurrence of an eigenstate with a vanishing energy . in this paper",
    "we consider the zero energy schrdinger equation that we write into the form of an integral equation incorporating the boundary conditions @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the green function of the kinetic energy operator and is explicitly given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "an important technical difficulty appears if the potential possesses some changes of sign ( see relation ( [ eq7 ] ) below ) .",
    "this is overcome for the derivation of necessary conditions , or of upper bounds on the number of bound states , by replacing the potential by its negative part @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , the potential @xmath39 is more attractive than @xmath4 and thus a necessary condition for existence of bound states in @xmath39 is certainly a valid necessary condition for @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure can no longer be used to obtain sufficient conditions .",
    "for this reason we consider potentials that are nowhere positive , @xmath2 , with @xmath40 .    to obtain a symmetrical kernel",
    "we now introduce the function @xmath41 as follow @xmath42 equation ( [ eq5 ] ) becomes @xmath43 where the symmetric kernel @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 the relation ( [ eq8 ] ) is thus an eigenvalue problem with a symmetric kernel and , for each value of @xmath3 , the smallest characteristic numbers are just the critical values @xmath0 .",
    "the higher characteristic numbers correspond to the critical values of the strength for which a second , a third , ... , @xmath3-wave bound state appears .",
    "the kernel ( [ eq9 ] ) acting on the hilbert space @xmath46 is an hilbert - schmidt kernel @xcite for the class of potentials defined by ( [ intv ] ) , i.e. satisfies the inequality @xmath47 consequently the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq8 ] ) always possesses at least one characteristic number @xcite ( in general , this problem has an infinity of characteristic numbers ) .",
    "we propose now to solve the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq8 ] ) using iterative methods .",
    "let us write , for simplicity , the relation ( [ eq8 ] ) under the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the symmetric linear operator , operating on the hilbert space @xmath46 , which is in this paper the integral operator generated by the so - called birman - schwinger @xcite kernel @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "since the kernel @xmath44 is hilbert - schmidt , @xmath49 is a compact operator @xcite .",
    "as @xmath49 is symmetric the riesz theorem applies @xcite . for _ each _ value of the angular momentum @xmath3 , the set of eigenvalues @xmath51 , @xmath52 , ( which in the present case are all positive ) can be ordered according to a sequence tending to zero , @xmath53 .",
    "there exists an orthonormal basis in @xmath46 , labeled @xmath54 , @xmath15 , each @xmath54 being associated to @xmath51 , and for each function @xmath55 @xmath56 where the symbol @xmath57 denotes the scalar product @xmath58 . for the sake of simplicity we have dropped the indices @xmath59 which should appear on @xmath60 and on @xmath54 .",
    "the positivity of the eigenvalues originates @xcite from the fact that @xmath49 is positive i.e. @xmath61    in the present case , where the potential has the spherical symmetry , there is no degeneracy and we have strict inequalities for the eigenvalues @xmath62 this is due to the fact that the eigenstates are solutions of a linear second order equation with constraints at the origin and infinity .",
    "now , we introduce the iterated kernel @xmath63 of @xmath64 @xmath65 with @xmath66 we can then compute the scalar product between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and find @xmath69 therefore , we obtain the following convexity - type relation @xmath70 since the left hand side of this latter equality is positive we conclude that the sequence @xmath71 with @xmath72 is always _",
    "increasing_.    on the other hand , taking into account ( [ ries ] ) and ( [ delt ] ) we have @xmath73 due to the strict inequalities ( [ ineq ] ) and the parseval s formula @xmath74 the sequence @xmath75 converges to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the lowest critical value of the coupling constant of the potential , except when @xmath78 is zero .",
    "this procedure , known in the literature as the iterated power method , yields the maximal eigenvalue of the problem considered , i.e. in the present case to the lowest critical value @xmath79 .",
    "any starting positive ( non zero ) squared integrable function @xmath80 is appropriated .",
    "indeed the function @xmath81 has no node which insures that the scalar product @xmath82 is not zero .",
    "( in our numerical studies , presented in section [ sec4 ] use is made of the choice @xmath83 ) .",
    "moreover since @xmath84 is increasing we get upper bounds for @xmath0 namely @xmath85 .",
    "there exists other iterative methods in the literature and we discuss briefly two variants of them in the next two sections .      in this section , we consider the method proposed by kellogg for the compact operator @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we construct the following sequence of functions @xmath86 where @xmath44 is given by ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "this latter relation is schematically written as : [ eq11 ] @xmath87 for non zero @xmath88 , kellogg considers the following sequence of numbers @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the @xmath91 norm of the function @xmath92 .",
    "we keep our conventions namely @xmath81 , @xmath93 , ... , still denote the eigenfunctions of the problem ( [ eq10 ] ) and @xmath94 are the corresponding characteristic numbers .",
    "suppose that @xmath88 is orthogonal to the functions @xmath81 , @xmath93 , ... , @xmath95 but not orthogonal to the function @xmath96 .",

    "moreover the sequence of functions @xmath100 converges to @xmath96 in @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "consequently there exists a subsequence of @xmath101 which converges almost everywhere to @xmath96 .",
    "the convergence of @xmath97 is illustrated simply here , where we are interested by the smallest characteristic number @xmath0 .",
    "still we choose a positive ( non zero ) squared integrable function @xmath88 , which , according to our previous discussion , is not orthogonal to @xmath81 . the sequence of numbers @xmath97 provides us upper bounds for @xmath0 because this sequence is _ decreasing _ and converges to @xmath0 .",
    "the monotony of the sequence @xmath102 is related to the following equation , derived from ( [ ries ] ) , @xmath103 which leads to the inequality @xmath104 the positivity of @xmath97 asserts @xmath105 .",
