    "nonlinear topological excitations in 2d spin systems of soliton or vortex type are known to play an essential role in 2d magnetism .",

    "they are important for the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of magnets , for a review see ref .  .",
    "the vortex contribution to the response functions of 2d magnets has been predicted theoretically@xcite and observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "a second wind in the physics of magnetic vortices appeared less than five years ago due to the direct observation of vortices in permalloy ( py , @xmath7 ) @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite magnetic nanodots .",
    "such nanodots are submicron disk  shaped particles , which have a single vortex in the ground state due to the competition between exchange and magnetic dipole ",
    "dipole interaction.@xcite a vortex state is obtained in nanodots that are larger than a single domain whose size is a few nanometers ( e.g. for the py  nanodot the exchange length @xmath9 ) . the vortex state of magnetic nanodots has drawn much attention because it could be used for high - density magnetic storage and miniature sensors .",
    "for this one needs to control magnetization reversal , a process where vortices play a big role @xcite .",
    "the vortex signature has been probed by lorentz transmission electron microscopy@xcite and magnetic force measurements@xcite .",
    "great progress has been made recently with the possibility to observe high frequency dynamical properties of the vortex state magnetic dots by brillouin light scattering of spin waves @xcite , time  resolved kerr microscopy @xcite , phase sensitive fourier transformation technique @xcite , and x  ray imaging technique @xcite .",
    "these have shown that the vortex performs a gyrotropic precession when it is initially displaced from the center of the dot , e.g. by an in  plane magnetic field pulse .",
    "@xcite    in general the vortex mesoscopic dynamics is described by the thiele collective coordinate approach @xcite , which considers the vortex as a rigid structure not having internal degrees of freedom.@xcite however recent experimental and theoretical studies @xcite indicate phenomena which can not be explained using such a simple picture .",
    "one striking example is the switching of the vortex polarization @xcite , where coupling occurs between the vortex motion and oscillations of its core .",
    "another one is the cycloidal oscillations of the vortex around its mean path @xcite where the dynamics of the vortex center is strongly coupled to spin waves . in this way the internal dynamics of the vortex plays a vital part .",
    "one of the first attempts to take into account the internal structure of vortices was presented in ref .   which showed that a variation of the core radius slaved to the position explained the motion of a vortex pair across an interface between two materials of different anisotropy .",
    "some progress has been achieved in ref .   where we have confirmed that internal degrees of freedom play a crucial role in the dynamics of vortices driven by an external time - dependent magnetic field in a classical spin system .    here",
    "we present a complete study of this problem using direct numerical simulations of the spin system and a collective variable theory which includes an internal mode .",
    "we show that the periodic forcing of the system by the time dependent magnetic field together with the damping stabilizes the vortex in a finite domain .",
    "this limit cycle exists because of the interplay between the magnetization and the vortex position so that it is essential to include an internal mode in the collective variable theory to describe it .",
    "when this is done , the theory yields the domain of stability in parameter space and the main dependencies on the field amplitude @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 . it can be seen as a one of the first generalizations to vortices of the collective variable theories developed for 1d klein - gordon kinks by rice @xcite which include the width of the kink together with its position .    in the next section [ sec : continuum ]",

    "this is the case when the frequency is very small , such that the field is practically static .",
