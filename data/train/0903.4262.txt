    "wormholes are tunnels in the geometry of space and time that connect two separate and distinct regions of spacetimes .",
    "although such objects were long known to be solutions of einstein equation , a renaissance in the study of wormholes has taken place during 80 s motivated by the possibility of quick interstellar travel @xcite .",
    "wormhole physics is a specific example of adopting the reverse philosophy of solving the gravitational field equation , by first constructing the spacetime metric , then deducing the stress - energy tensor components .",
    "thus , it was found that these traversable wormholes possess a stress - energy tensor that violates the standard energy conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for a more recent review ) .",
    "the literature is rather extensive in candidates for wormhole spacetimes in einstein gravity , and one may mention several cases , ranging from wormhole solutions in the presence of the cosmological constant @xcite , wormhole geometries in higher dimensions @xcite , to geometries in the context of linear and nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "also the stability of wormhole solutions has been analyzed by considering specific equations of state @xcite , or by applying a linearized radial perturbation around a stable solution @xcite .",
    "one of the main areas in wormhole research is to try to avoid , as much as possible , the violation of the standard energy conditions . for static wormholes of einstein gravity",
    "the null energy condition is violated , and thus , several attempts have been made to somehow overcome this problem . in order to do this , some authors resort to the alternative theories of gravity : the wormhole geometries of brans - dicke theory have been investigated in @xcite ; of kaluza - klein theory in @xcite ; and of a higher curvature gravity in @xcite . in the latter",
    ", it was found that the weak energy condition may be respected in the throat vicinity of the wormholes of higher curvature gravity . a special branch of higher curvature gravity which respects the assumptions of einstein that the left - hand side of the field equations is the most general symmetric conserved tensor containing no more than two derivatives of the metric is the lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "this theory represents a very interesting scenario to study how the physics of gravity are corrected at short distance due to the presence of higher order curvature terms in the action .",
    "static solutions of second and third orders lovelock gravity have been introduced in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for wormholes with small throat radius ,",
    "the curvature near the throat is very large , and therefore the investigation of the effects of higher curvature terms becomes important .",
    "the possibility of obtaining a wormhole solution from the instanton solutions of lovelock gravity has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the wormhole solutions of dimensionally continued lovelock gravity have been introduced in @xcite , while these kind of solutions in second order lovelock gravity and the possibility of obtaining solutions with normal and exotic matter limited to the vicinity of the throat have been explored in @xcite . here , we want to add the third order term of lovelock theory to the gravitational field equations , and investigate the effects of it on the possibility of having wormhole solutions with normal matter .",
    "we also want to explore the effects of higher order lovelock terms on the region of normal matter near the throat .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we give a brief review of the field equations of third order lovelock gravity and introduce the wormhole solutions of this theory in sec .",
    "[ stat ] . in sec .",
    "[ exotic ] , we present the conditions of having normal matter near the throat and exotic matter everywhere .",
    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "we , first , give a brief review of the field equations of third order lovelock gravity , and then we consider the static wormhole solutions of the theory . the most fundamental assumption in standard general relativity is the requirement that the field equations be generally covariant and contain at most second order derivative of the metric .",
    "based on this principle , the most general classical theory of gravitation in @xmath0 dimensions is the lovelock gravity . the lovelock equation up to third order terms without the cosmological constant term may be written as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 s are lovelock coefficients , @xmath6 is the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath7 is just the einstein tensor , @xmath8 is the gauss - bonnet lagrangian , @xmath9 is the third order lovelock lagrangian , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12 @xmath13 respectively .    as in the paper of morris and thorne @xcite",
    ", we adopt the reverse philosophy in solving the third order lovelock field equation , namely , we first consider an interesting and exotic spacetime metric , then finds the matter source responsible for the respective geometry .",
    "the generalized metric of morris and thorne in @xmath0 dimensions may be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the redshift function and shape function , respectively . although the metric coefficient @xmath17 becomes divergent at the throat of the wormhole @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , the proper radial distance @xmath20 is required to be finite everywhere .",
    "the metric ( [ met1 ] ) represents a traversable wormhole provided the function @xmath15 is finite everywhere and the shape function @xmath16 satisfies the following two conditions : @xmath21 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "the first condition is due to the fact that the proper radial distance should be real and finite for @xmath23 , and the second condition comes from the flaring - out condition @xcite .",
    "the mathematical analysis and the physical interpretation will be simplified using a set of orthonormal basis vectors @xmath24 using the orthonormal basis ( [ basis ] ) , the components of energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 carry a simple physical interpretation , i.e. , @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is the energy density , @xmath28 is the radial tension , and @xmath29 is the pressure measured in the tangential directions orthogonal to the radial direction .",
