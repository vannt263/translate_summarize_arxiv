    "all twelve blue plume candidates are located within @xmath3 of the center of leo a ; probable foreground objects are distributed more uniformly across the field .",
    "we obtained spectroscopy of the twelve blue plume objects with the 6.5 m mmt telescope and the blue channel spectrograph .",
    "observations occurred during the course of our hypervelocity star survey program on the nights of 2005 dec 5 - 6 , 2006 may 24 - 25 , 2006 june 20 , 2006 dec 27 , and 2007 mar 18 .",

    "we obtained comparison lamp exposures after every exposure .",
    "the wavelength solutions are determined from 44 lines with typical root - mean - square residuals of @xmath25  , or @xmath26 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we note that the single slit spectrograph is a compact instrument with minimal flexure : wavelength solutions shift by less than 1 pixel ( 0.355  ) during a night , easily measured from individual comparison lamp exposures .",
    "ten blue plume objects are stars of b spectral type and two are h ii regions .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] plots the spectra of the ten stars and the two h ii regions , summed and shifted to the rest frame .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath27 ) of the individual spectra range from @xmath28 to 15 per pixel at 4000  , and depend on target s apparent magnitude and the seeing conditions of the observation .",
    "the ten b - type stars have visibly narrower balmer lines and thus lower surface gravity than the other b - type stars in the @xcite hypervelocity star survey .",
    "cross - correlation with mk spectral standards @xcite indicates that the stars are probably luminosity class i or ii b supergiants , consistent with the stars inferred luminosities .    at the distance modulus of leo a @xmath29 @xcite , the ten b - type stars have absolute magnitudes ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite give absolute magnitudes @xmath32 for a b9 ib star and @xmath33 for a b9 ii star .",
    "we conclude the ten stars are likely b supergiants in leo a. such b supergiants have ages ranging from @xmath530 myr for the most luminous stars to @xmath5200 myr for the least luminous stars @xcite .",
    "we measure radial velocities with the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "we begin by observing the b9 ii star @xmath34 lyr by quickly scanning the star across the spectrograph slit .",
    "this procedure provides us with a very high signal - to - noise ratio cross - correlation template with a known velocity @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the velocity zero - point comes from the error on the mean of the 44 comparison lamp lines used to determine the template s wavelength solution , @xmath35 km s@xmath1 .",
    "is is important that we maximize velocity precision for our velocity dispersion measurement , and we achieve the best precision by cross - correlating the stars with themselves .",
    "thus , after measuring the stars velocities with the @xmath34 lyr template , we shift the spectra to the rest frame and sum them together to create a second template ( shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "we then cross - correlate the ten stars with this second template of themselves . table [ tab : obs ] lists the resulting heliocentric radial velocities and errors .",
    "the mean cross - correlation precision is @xmath36 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we also measure the radial velocities of the h ii regions with rvsao , but this time using gaussian fits to the emission lines .",
    "the final velocity of sdss j095927.532 + 304457.75 comes from a weighted mean of the 3727 [ oii ] doublet ( resolved in our spectra ) , h@xmath37 , and h@xmath34 emission lines .",
    "a low - dispersion spectrum of sdss j095933.320 + 304439.21 provides additional line measurements from h@xmath38 , [ oiii ] , and h@xmath39 for that object .",
    "the velocity of sdss j095933.320 + 304439.21 is the weighted average of all of its observed lines .",
    "the mean emission - line velocity error is @xmath40 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the average velocity of our twelve leo a objects is @xmath41 km s@xmath1 ( see figure [ fig : vel ] ) , statistically identical with the @xmath42 km s@xmath1 systemic h i velocity measured by @xcite and the 23.2 - 24.0 km s@xmath1 systemic h i velocities measured by @xcite .",
    "thus the velocities of our twelve objects are all consistent with membership in leo a.    the root - mean - square velocity dispersion of our twelve objects is 10.0 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion by subtracting in quadrature the average 3.8 km s@xmath1 uncertainty of the observations .",
    "thus we measure an intrinsic stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we estimate the robustness of the velocity dispersion measurement by comparing the cumulative distribution of velocities to a gaussian distribution ( see figure [ fig : vel ] ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test finds a 0.5 likelihood of drawing the twelve objects from a gaussian distribution with the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "greater number statistics are always desirable , but it appears that the twelve blue plume objects provide a statistically sound measurement of leo a s stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "our stellar velocity dispersion measurement is identical to the h i gas velocity dispersion measured by @xcite : @xmath43 km s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite also observe an h i component with @xmath44 km s@xmath1 dispersion localized in high column - density regions .",
    "if we remove the two h ii regions from our own analysis , the b - type stars have a mean velocity of @xmath45 km s@xmath1 and an intrinsic velocity dispersion of @xmath46 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this dispersion is statistically identical to our original value",
    ".    there is no evidence for rotation of the stellar component of leo a ; the high- and low - velocity blue plume objects appear inter - mixed on the sky .",
    "this result is consistent with absence of rotation seen in the h i gas @xcite . given that detailed h i maps show velocity structure in leo a @xcite , it is possible that additional observations may reveal structure in the stellar radial velocity distribution .",

    "our objects are located inside a radius of @xmath62 pc , while leo a s observed stellar distribution extends to a radius of @xmath63 pc .",
    "if we choose @xmath64 pc , leo a s virial mass is @xmath65 .    the virial theorem , however , is both more biased and less stable for small numbers of test particles than is the projected mass estimator @xcite",
    ". thus we use the @xcite projected mass estimator to obtain a more accurate estimate of leo a s mass : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the gravitational constant , @xmath68 is the number of stars , @xmath39 is an empirical correction to the center of mass ( heisler et al .",
    "use @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 is the velocity relative to the mean , @xmath71 is the projected separation from the center of the galaxy , and @xmath72 is a constant that depends on the eccentricity of the stellar orbits . for purely isotropic orbits @xmath73 , while for purely radial orbits@xmath74 . using the velocities and positions in table [ tab : obs ] , leo a has a kinematic mass of @xmath75 for purely isotropic orbits and @xmath76 for purely radial orbits .",
    "heisler et al .",
    "prefer using the smaller mass derived from isotropic orbits , but for purposes of discussion , we will assume that leo a s mass is the average of the two projected mass estimates : @xmath77 .",
    "this mass is derived from objects inside a radius of @xmath62 pc .    by comparison ,",
    "@xcite estimate that leo a s stellar mass is @xmath78 m@xmath79 , consistent with the galaxy s optical luminosity .",
    "more recently , @xcite use _ spitzer _ 4.5  imaging to estimate that leo a s total stellar mass is @xmath80 m@xmath79 with an uncertainty of 0.5 dex .",
    "these stellar mass estimates are factors of 20 - 100 times smaller than our kinematic mass estimate .",
    "leo a s total @xmath81-band luminosity is @xmath82 , which comes from the apparent magnitude @xmath83 @xcite and the distance modulus @xmath29 @xcite . assuming the sun has @xmath84 , leo a s total luminosity in solar units is @xmath85 .",
    "thus the mass - to - light ratio of leo a is @xmath86 for a mass of @xmath87 . because our spectroscopic targets do not sample the full extent of leo a , this mass - to - light ratio is a lower limit to leo a s true mass - to - light ratio .",
    "a mass - to - light ratio of 20 suggests that leo a is dominated by dark matter .",
    "@xcite reach the opposite conclusion from their h i velocity dispersion , but their result is explained by the revision of leo a s distance from 2.2 mpc to 800 kpc .",
    "leo a s total h i mass within @xmath88 is @xmath89 @xcite at a distance of 800 kpc .",
    "the gas mass includes the 10% correction for helium gas .",
    "thus baryonic matter  stars plus gas  accounts for at most @xmath520% of leo a s total mass .",
    "we have obtained spectroscopy for twelve blue plume objects in the central @xmath3 of leo a. ten of these objects are young b supergiants .",
    "we measure a stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , identical to leo a s h i gas dispersion @xcite . from this",
    "we estimate a projected mass of @xmath90 , which implies that leo a s mass is at least @xmath580% dark matter .",
    "dwarf galaxies are thought to be the smallest bodies containing dynamically significant amounts of dark matter , and so it is interesting to place leo a in the context of cosmological simulations .",
    "@xcite show that the velocity dispersion of dark matter halos follow a tight correlation with total mass , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the mass within a sphere with mean interior density 200 times the critical density .",
    "leo a s mass , @xmath93 , would fill such a sphere with a radius of @xmath94 kpc .",
    "the halo virial relation is derived from @xmath95 dark matter halos , but evrard et al .",
    "show it is valid down to @xmath96 halos .",
    "if we simply equate leo a s mass to @xmath92 , the halo virial relation predicts @xmath97 km s@xmath1 for @xmath98 .",
    "this prediction is less than half of the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "one possible explanation for the discrepancy is that leo a has not reached dynamical equilibrium , and thus its velocity dispersion is inflated @xcite . or , perhaps the discrepancy suggests that dwarfs like leo a experience a different evolutionary path than a purely hierarchical growth of dark matter halos .",
    "remarkably , leo a s stellar velocity dispersion is very similar to that of local group dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) , which have central velocity dispersions of 8 to 10 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "one explanation for the common central velocity dispersion is that all local group dwarfs are enclosed in dark matter halos of similar total mass @xcite .",
    "galaxies with smaller velocity dispersions ( total mass @xmath99 ) are possibly re - ionized and thus never form stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if this picture is correct , then the total mass to light ratio of a dwarf is a function of its luminosity @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the fixed dark matter halo mass , @xmath102 is the total @xmath81-band luminosity , and @xmath103 is the stellar mass to light ratio .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ml ] we plot the @xmath104 versus @xmath81-band luminosity for local group dsphs with central velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "we note that leo a has a central velocity dispersion and no observed rotation , thus its dynamical mass is directly comparable with dsphs .",
    "dwarf irregulars have masses determined from rotation and are not directly comparable .",
    "we base figure [ fig : ml ] on the @xcite version of @xcite s plot .",
    "the solid squares are and ii @xcite , and ix @xcite , botes @xcite , carina and sextans @xcite , draco and ursa minor @xcite , fornax @xcite , leo i @xcite , leo ii and sculptor @xcite , and ursa major @xcite .",
    "the dashed line shows the @xmath104 relation for a fixed dark matter halo mass @xmath105 and stellar @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "leo a , plotted as a star , falls very near the fixed halo mass relation for dsphs .",
    "however , leo a s stellar population is quite different from that of the dsphs .",
    "integrated colors provide a quantitative measure of the difference : leo a has @xmath107 , systematically bluer than the average dsph with @xmath108 @xcite . as its stellar population ages ,",
    "leo a s luminosity will decrease and its mass to light ratio will increase .",
    "we estimate this change using starburst99 @xcite with @xmath109 padova tracks .",
    "we find that in a couple of gyr , assuming leo a has no further star formation , it will reach @xmath110 and will have faded @xmath111 magnitudes in @xmath112 .",
    "we indicate this evolution with the arrow in figure [ fig : ml ] .",
    "leo a still falls well within the observed scatter around the @xmath104 relation .",
    "comparing leo a with `` transition dwarfs '' may be more fair than comparing with dsphs .",
    "transition dwarfs have old stellar populations like dsphs , but also contain gas and young stars like leo a. a central velocity dispersion is available for the phoenix transition dwarf @xcite ( the open square in figure [ fig : ml ] ) , which places it squarely on the @xmath104 relation .",
    "thus , despite their different star formation histories , leo a , phoenix , and the dsphs appear to share remarkably similar kinematics and dark matter halo mass .",
    "if transition dwarfs represent the stage between gas - rich dwarf irregulars and gas - poor dsphs , this evolution must involve some amount of galaxy interaction .",
    "most dsphs in the local group are located near the major spirals , so the dsphs lack of gas and young stars likely results from repeated gravitational and/or hydrodynamic interactions with the spirals . in a comprehensive study of minor galaxy interactions in the sdss ,",
    "@xcite find that the lowest luminosity galaxies in close pairs experience the largest fractional boosts in their specific star formation rates .",
    "perhaps leo a s episodic star formation history is a history of its interactions with objects in the local group .",
    "one clue to the evolution of transition dwarfs in the local group may come from comparison of the rotation velocity and central velocity dispersion .",
    "a wide variety of studies demonstrate the relation between these kinematic measures and the formation history of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "multi - slit spectrographs can now provide radial velocities for hundreds of stars in nearby dwarfs , making such studies possible for the first time .",
