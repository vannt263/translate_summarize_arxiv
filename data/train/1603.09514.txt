    "ultracold atomic bose gases in a 1d geometry @xcite have attracted a great deal of interest as they yield a fascinating physics and many surprises not encountered in 2d and 3d .",
    "the regime of a weakly interacting gas requires the criterion @xmath0 which is the ratio between the interaction energy and the kinetic energy of the ground state , where @xmath1 is a coupling characterizes the interaction , @xmath2 the atomic mass and @xmath3 the 1d condensed density .",
    "in such a regime the mean - field theory can be safely used and a trapped true bec is possible . in the limit @xmath4 which corresponds to small density or large interaction , the gas transforms into a strongly interacting system and acquires fermi properties . in this case",
    "it is called a gas of impenetrable bosons or gas of tonks - girardeau ( tg ) @xcite .",
    "bose gases in very elongated traps which feature of 1d condensate , have been studied in different regimes of quantum degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the sum - rule approach @xcite , time - dependent modified nonlinear schrdinger equation ( mnlse ) @xcite , numerical monte carlo simulations @xcite , hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb)-based approaches @xcite and finite - temperature hydrodynamics @xcite have successfully predicted the collective modes of both weakly and strongly interacting 1d bose gases at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "experimental investigations of the breathing oscillations in 1d ultracold gases have been reported by several groups @xcite .",
    "the main finding emerging from these explorations is that the breathing mode frequencies as a function of the interaction strength , go through two crossovers : from the value 2 down to @xmath5 and then back to 2 , as the system goes from noninteracting to weakly interacting and then from weakly interacting to the tg regime @xcite .    at nonzero temperatures ,",
    "the elementary excitations arising from quantum and thermal fluctuations are always present @xcite and may considerably affecte the dynamics of the condensate .",
    "it is well known that at finite temperature , the condensate coexists with the cloud of thermal excitations and the anomalous component .",
    "this latter quantity which , survives naturally in bose systems , can be interpreted as the density of pair - correlated atoms .",
    "this pairing phase is similar to the bcs phase in superconductors at low temperature proposed by evans and imry @xcite a long time ago .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that the anomalous density accompanies in an analogous manner the condensate : they both arise from the gauge symmetry breaking @xcite . if the condensate density is nonzero , the anomalous average is also finite .",
    "conversely , when the condensate becomes zero , the anomalous density has also to disappear .",
    "moreover , in homogeneous 2d bose systems , the condensate and the anomalous density exist together at zero temperature while they both do not survive at any nonzero temperature @xcite due to the destruction of the long - range order .",
    "in spatially uniform 1d bose gases , bec and the anomalous states do not occur at all temperatures .",
    "however , the presence of a trapping potential in such systems introduces a finite size of the sample and drastically changes the picture of long - wave fluctuations of the phase and thus , the phase coherence over the finite sample size is restored .",
    "certainly , the presence of the anomalous density in an ultracold bose gas plays a crucial role in its dynamical and thermodynamical properties .",
    "first of all , the anomalous phase is usually of the order of or even larger than the noncondensed density @xcite .",
    "so , the exclusion of such a quantity is indeed an unjustified approximation and may render the system unstable @xcite .",
    "moreover , the absence of the anomalous density prevents the occurrence of the superfluidity in bose gases @xcite , which is natural since both quantities arise from atomic correlations .",
    "the inclusion of the anomalous correlations in a 3d harmonically trapped bose gas , accounts well for shifts in the lower - lying excitation of the jila experiment @xcite . in attractively interacting becs , it has been found that the anomalous fluctuation causes the condensate to collapse and the 1d soliton to split into two solitonic structures @xcite .    in view of these circumstances",
    "it is then interesting to study the properties of a quasi-1d weakly interacting bec in the presence of the anomalous density .",
    "obviously , this mixed system is categorically different from that of a pure bec especially at intermediate temperatures where the anomalous density reaches its maximum @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the collective modes of both the condensate and the anomalous components in a quasi-1d trapped bose gas at finite temperature utilizing our tdhfb theory @xcite .",
    "the tdhfb is a self - consistent approach describing the dynamics of ultracold bose gases .",
    "the main feature of this theory is that it preserves the validity of conservation laws , and a gapless spectrum of collective excitations .",
    "the tdhfb approach is based on the time - dependent balian - vrroni ( bv ) variational principle @xcite which requires the minimization of an action which involves two variational objects : one is related to the observables of interest and the other is akin to a density matrix @xcite .",
    "the theory is valid for arbitrary interacting bose systems , whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium , uniform or nonuniform , in the presence of any external potentials , at any temperature and in any dimension .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[flism ] , we introduce our tdhfb model which describes selfconsistently the dynamics of a trapped bose gas at finite temperature and establish its validity criterion .",
    "we analyze the profiles of the condensed and anomalous densities for different temperatures . in sec .",
    "[ cm ] , we use the tdhfb within the hydrodynamic equations to investigate the collective oscillations and the density fluctuations of the condensate and the anomalous fraction .",
    "this quite general approach permits us to obtain an analytical expression for the dispersion relation of the anomalous component in a quasi-1d setting .",
    "we highlight effects of the anomalous fluctuations and temperature on excitation frequencies . at zero temperature",
    ", we compare our findings for the breathing mode frequencies of the mixed system with recent experimental , theoretical and numerical predictions in the entire spectrum of interaction regimes from the non - interacting gas , passing by the mean - field regime , to the tg limit .",
    "our concluding remarks are presented is sec.[concl ] .",
    "we consider a weakly interacting bose gas confined in a highly anisotropic trap where the longitudinal and transverse trapping frequencies are @xmath6 .",
    "in such a case , the system can be considered as quasi-1d and , hence , the coupling constants effectively take their 1d form , namely @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath9-wave scattering length . the tdhfb equations which we choose to employ here constitute a model well suited to this task because it governs both the dynamics of the condensate and the anomalous density at finite temperature . in this quasi-1d geometry",

    "the total density in bec is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 stands for the renormalized coupling constant @xcite , and @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the small parameter of the weakly interacting regime becomes : @xmath24 indicating that a dilute 1d system requires small anomalous fluctuations .",
    "if one neglects both the noncondensed and the anomalous densities ( @xmath25 ) , the set ( [ e : td ] ) simplifies to the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the tdhfb equations reduce to the hfb - popov ( hfbp ) approach which is gapless and coincides with the hf approximation at high temperature .",
    "very recently , the hfbp approximation has been applied in a harmonically trapped 1d bose gas to study the collective modes at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "note that the tdhfb equations have been discussed by many authors using different methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in spirit of the mean - field theory , linearized tdhfb equations have been derived in @xcite to study the damping and the collective oscillations in the collisionless regime .",
    "our tdhfb formalism is usually given in the form of nonlocal coupled equations for the condensate order parameter and the single particle density matrix @xcite .",
    "a striking advantage of such equations would be that they can be solved self - consistently using the exact non - local interaction potential ( dipolar , gravitational , etc . ) .",
    "the validity criterion of the tdhfb theory ( [ e : td ] ) , as all hfb - like theories , requires that the temperature should be much smaller than a certain characteristic temperature @xmath27 @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the degeneracy temperature ( the boltzmann constant @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is the chemical potential of the condensate . at @xmath32 ,",
    "both the density and phase fluctuations are suppressed , and hence , there is a true condensate ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in the temperature range @xmath33 ,",
    "the density fluctuations are suppressed but the phase fluctuations are large , this is often refereed to as quasi - condensate ( or condensate with fluctuating phase)@xcite . in this regime , many experiments @xcite in 1d bose gases are carried out revealing that finite - temperature effects are more pronounced and the properties due to elementary excitations are rather different than those of nearly pure 1d becs .",
    "an interesting feature of our formalism is that the noncondensed and the anomalous densities are not independent . by deriving an explicit relationship between them",
    ", it is possible to eliminate @xmath34 via @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is often known as the heisenberg invariant @xcite and represents the variance of the number of noncondensed particles .",

    "the reduced set of equations are then the coupled equations ( [ e : td ] ) with @xmath34 is replaced by the expression ( [ inv ] ) .",
    "this latter clearly shows that @xmath41 is larger than @xmath34 at zero temperature , so the neglect of the anomalous density is a hazardous approximation .",
    "importantly , the expression of @xmath34 not only makes the set ( [ e : td ] ) close and enables us to reduce the number of equations making the numerical simulation easier but also allows us to highlight the role of the anomalous density in the dynamics and the collective modes of the system .     and @xmath53 .",

    "<S> we study the collective modes of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the presence of the anomalous density using the time - dependent - hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) theory . within the hydrodynamic equations , we derive analytical expressions for the mode frequencies and the density fluctuations of the anomalous density which constitutes the minority component at very low temperature and feels an effective external potential exerted by the majority component i.e. the condensate . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically examine the temperature dependence of the breathing mode oscillations of the condensate at finite temperature in the weak - coupling regime . at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> we compare our predictions with available experimental data , theoretical treatments and monte carlo simulations in all interaction regimes and the remaining hindrances are emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the anomalous correlations have a non - negligible role on the collective modes at both zero and finite temperatures . </S>"
