    "anyons @xcite are two - dimensional particles whose wave function @xmath0 obeys the interchange conditions @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes continuous anticlockwise interchange of particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 , such that no other particles are encircled , and @xmath5 is the statistics parameter , which may be any real number . for a given hamiltonian ,",
    "not explicitly dependent on @xmath5 and with a discrete spectrum for any @xmath5 , the energy eigenvalues @xmath6 and ( usually ) the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath7 will be continuous functions of @xmath5 .",
    "a continuous function @xmath6 , for a fixed index @xmath8 and @xmath9 , is what we will refer to as an ( anyon ) trajectory . for an earlier discussion of the @xmath5 dependence of the states ,",
    "see @xcite .    since the exponent in ( [ int ] ) is the only place where @xmath5 appears in this formulation , the spectrum and the set of energy eigenstates are obviously periodic in @xmath5 with period 2 ; thus , all the information is contained in the sets @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "however , individual trajectories are not generally periodic in @xmath5 ; one way to see this is to observe that when @xmath5 increases continuously , the kinetic angular momentum @xmath13 changes according to the formula @xmath14 with @xmath15 an integer rotation of the whole system multiplies the wave function by a phase factor , which equals , on the one hand , @xmath16 $ ] , and on the other hand , @xmath17 $ ] , since each of the @xmath18 pairs of anyons is interchanged twice . ] , so that changing @xmath5 by 2 will not bring us back to the same state .",
    "it is assumed that the hamiltonian is rotationally invariant , so that @xmath13 is a good quantum number .",
    "thus , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , will be the energy of some state with statistics parameter @xmath5 , but the index of that state will be different from @xmath8 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 depends on @xmath8 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 . at any given @xmath5 , the trajectories @xmath8 and @xmath22 look different , having different angular momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but when viewed on the interval @xmath27 , they are seen to be copies of one and the same trajectory , shifted by @xmath28 along the @xmath5 axis .    to represent the trajectories in a way which is not redundant , it is convenient to take @xmath13 as a parameter instead of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath13 is directly related to @xmath5 by equation ( [ angm ] ) , it is an observable ( gauge invariant ) quantity , and the dependence @xmath29 is the same for all the trajectories that are shifted copies of one another .",
    "we arrive at the viewpoint that the states of an @xmath30-anyon problem may be obtained from the set of trajectories , i.e. , functions @xmath29 for @xmath31 .",
    "this provides a more economical and unified way of decribing the @xmath30-anyon spectra . for each trajectory",
    "there is an integer value @xmath15 such that the statistics is bosonic at angular momenta @xmath32 .",
    "we may always choose @xmath33 .",
    "the value of @xmath15 groups the set of trajectories into @xmath34 classes .",
    "only trajectories from the same class can cross , i.e.  have the same @xmath35 and @xmath13 at the same statistics .",
    "a part of a trajectory between any two neighboring bosonic points corresponds to what is usually referred to as one anyon state on the interval @xmath12 .",
    "it is useful to have a geometric picture of this : if one plots a trajectory for @xmath36 and then wraps the plot around a cylinder of circumference @xmath34 , then points which correspond to @xmath5 differing by an even number ( that is , to the same statistics ) will fall on the same vertical line . on the surface of the cylinder one will see the set of all @xmath30-anyon states corresponding to the trajectory .",
    "thus , an infinite number of pieces of trajectories ( or states in the usual terminology ) on the interval @xmath12 are shown to make up one single trajectory on the interval @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , certain anyon ( and in particular , boson or fermion ) states that are usually considered entirely different , are in fact parts of one and the same continuous pattern .",
    "this is reminiscent of the method of organizing the spectra of particle physics into regge trajectories .",
    "in fact , by applying the concept of regge trajectories to a two - dimensional , two - particle system , one obtains the same grouping of bosonic / fermionic states .",
    "it follows that if some trajectory @xmath29 is analytic , then it is in principle sufficient to find only one of its pieces .",
    "the rest is uniquely determined by analytic continuation .",
    "this means that it is sufficient to find one anyonic state in some range of @xmath5 and then an infinite number of others are obtained `` automatically '' by analytic continuation and periodicity .",
    "however , trajectories are not always analytic . with our assumption that the hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on @xmath5 ( and",
    "involves only non - singular interactions ) both energies and wave functions will depend analytically on @xmath5 , except possibly at bosonic points .",
    "the source of non - analyticity is that the relative angular momentum of one pair of particles becomes zero , which can only happen at bosonic points .",
    "when there is non - analytic behavior at some point with degeneracy , one must determine how each trajectory continues through this point by investigating the corresponding wave functions .",
    "they should change continuously across these points .",
    "we are going now to apply this reasoning to the problems of two and three anyons in a rotation symmetric harmonic potential .",
    "we scale the variables so that @xmath38 , the mass @xmath39 and the angular frequency @xmath40 .",
    "two more preliminary remarks are in order .",
    "first , the potential is parity invariant ; hence , if @xmath0 is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian and satisfies ( [ int ] ) , then its complex conjugate @xmath41 is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian with the same energy and satisfies ( [ int ] ) with @xmath42 instead of @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", this implies that all information about the states is in fact contained in the interval @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "second , there is the tower structure of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that , for any number of anyons , all the states come in towers , the angular momentum being the same for all members of a tower and the energies being @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath44 is the energy of the lowest , `` bottom '' state .",
    "this sequence of levels is due to radial excitations .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the center - of - mass coordinates .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to find only the bottom states ( consequently , bottom trajectories ) ; from now on , we will always mean these , unless otherwise specified .",
    "now we will demonstrate that in the two - anyon problem there is only _",
    "one _ ( bottom ) trajectory , namely the continuation of the ground state .",
    "recall that the one - particle spectrum in the harmonic potential consists of states with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( so the degeneracy equals the energy ) .",
    "define complex coordinates by @xmath52 .",
    "since the center - of - mass motion is trivial , we will always concentrate on the relative motion only . for two anyons , the complete set of ( not normalized ) solutions",
    "may be written as @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 an integer , @xmath4 a non - negative integer , and @xmath56 standing for @xmath57 if @xmath58 and for @xmath59",
    "if @xmath60 ; the energy and the angular momentum are @xmath61 respectively .",
    "towers consist of states with the same @xmath55 and different @xmath4 ; in accordance with the aforesaid , it is sufficient to consider the bottom states only , for which @xmath62 and @xmath63 _ irrespective _ of @xmath55 . indeed ,",
    "all the states in question belong to one and the same trajectory , because the relation ( [ period ] ) does hold , in the form @xmath64 ( and the same for the wave function ) .",
    "for @xmath65 this is the ground state , @xmath66 thus , _ all _ bottom states are continuations of _ one _ ground state .",
    "equation ( [ el ] ) exemplify our previous remark that a trajectory may become non - analytic when the relative angular momentum of one pair of particles ( here @xmath13 itself ) becomes zero . by adding the pair potential @xmath67 to the hamiltonian , ( [ el ] )",
    "is changed to @xmath68 , which demonstrates that singular interactions may lead to different behaviours .",
    "we go now to the problem of three anyons , which is extremely interesting due to its nontriviality , on the one hand , and the possibility of a more or less exact analysis , on the other hand .",
    "recall some results available .",
    "a state starting with @xmath69 at @xmath70 ( @xmath4  integer ) may reach one of the following points at @xmath71 : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "in other words , in any interval from a bosonic to a fermionic point or from a fermionic to a bosonic point , each state is characterized by an ( average ) slope @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the change in energy , and @xmath78 is the change in angular momentum .",
    "for the @xmath79 states the dependence @xmath29 is linear , so that @xmath80 is the slope at any point in the interval , and their wave functions may be written down exactly @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath81 states the dependence is nonlinear , so a slope of @xmath82 is indeed only an average slope .",
    "now , there are exact expressions for the multiplicities of states with all slopes @xcite .",
    "if @xmath83 denotes the number of bottom states in the relative motion spectrum that go from @xmath69 to @xmath84 as @xmath5 goes from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , i.e. , from a bosonic to a fermionic point , then there are the asymptotic expressions for @xmath87 ( terms of order unity being omitted ) @xmath88 and the exact formulas @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "in each of the formulas , @xmath13 has to be within the respective interval specified and the equality @xmath91  ( mod 2 ) has to hold , otherwise @xmath92 .",
    "recall also that for all states at any statistics , there is the inequality @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "as one goes along a trajectory , the slope will change at certain values of @xmath13 , so any trajectory possesses a sequence of slopes and points of slope change .",
    "we make now the following statements .",
    "* for each trajectory there exists an @xmath94 such that @xmath95 if and only if @xmath96 . * for each trajectory there exists an @xmath97 such that @xmath98 if and only if @xmath99 .",
    "* the change of slope from / to @xmath100 can occur at bosonic points only , while the change from @xmath101 to @xmath102 or vice versa can occur at both bosonic and fermionic points .    to prove statement ( i ) , note first that the inequality @xmath103 and the fact that @xmath104 force every trajectory to have @xmath95 at least for some large positive values of @xmath13 .",
    "now , the explicit form of the @xmath95 states @xcite is such that if one of them exists for some @xmath105 , it does exist with @xmath95 for any @xmath106 , that is for any @xmath107 ; in other words , if @xmath95 at some point , then @xmath95 everywhere to the right of that point .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "a `` mirror reversed '' reasoning proves statement ( ii ) .",
    "statement ( iii ) is proved upon noticing that the change of slope from / to @xmath100 always implies nonanalyticity in the function @xmath29 , because it is a change between a linear and a nonlinear dependence .",
    "such nonanalyticity can only happen at bosonic points , as discussed in sec .  1 .",
    "this is also associated with the breakdown of regular perturbation theory dependent aharonov - bohm - type ( perturbative ) interaction .",
    "] at such points @xcite .    note that since statements ( i ) and ( ii ) mean that each trajectory has @xmath98 for some values of @xmath13 and @xmath95 , for some others , it follows that each trajectory is indeed nonanalytic at least at one point .",
    "( this is of course equally true for the @xmath30-anyon problem , where the extreme slopes , with linear behavior , are @xmath108 , and each trajectory possesses both of them just like in the case at hand ; cf .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "so far we may conclude that the behavior of each trajectory has the following features : at large negative @xmath13 , slope @xmath109 , at some point @xmath110 a change to @xmath111 , for @xmath112 some sequence of slopes @xmath111 and finally a change to @xmath113 at @xmath114 and always @xmath113 at @xmath115 .",
    "note that there is exactly one trajectory for which @xmath116 , that is which has slopes @xmath113 and @xmath109 only : the one which contains the ground state near bose statistics , @xmath117 where @xmath118 , and the overall gaussian factor is understood .",
    "we will now prove that    * each bottom trajectory may be unambiguously labeled by its @xmath114 point .",
    "indeed , given an arbitrary bosonic point @xmath69 , it is easy to see that the number of bottom trajectories for which @xmath119 , equals @xmath120 where the inequality follows from eq .",
    "( [ b+3 ] ) .",
    "the equality is reached , meaning that a trajectory with @xmath119 exists , for each @xmath69 such that @xmath121 and @xmath122  ( mod 2 ) . like the equation itself ,",
    "this statement is true up to terms of the order of unity .",
    "1 shows the exact picture of the distribution of the @xmath114 points on the plane ( the bullets and triangles will be explained later ) .",
    "we proceed to show how all the linear parts of the trajectories ( and thus all the three - anyon linear states ) are constructed as excitations of the `` ground trajectory '' , the one which contains the ground state . by virtue of symmetry , it is enough to consider @xmath95 states only .",
    "it is convenient to use the coordinates proposed in @xcite , which are the discrete fourier transform of the complex particle coordinates .",
    "the relative motion is described by @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "introduce the creation and annihilation operators @xmath125 and , with @xmath126 , the same relations for @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "then the relative hamiltonian and angular momentum operator become @xmath131 the commutation relations are @xmath132= [ b_u , b_u^{\\dagger}]=[a_v , a_v^{\\dagger}]=[b_v , b_v^{\\dagger}]=1 $ ] , and all other commutators vanish . consequently",
    ", if @xmath0 is a common eigenstate of @xmath133 and @xmath13 with quantum numbers @xmath69 , then @xmath134 is also a common eigenstate with @xmath135 .",
    "however , to yield true anyonic eigenstates , a combination of the creation operators must be fully symmetric and produce wave functions that are not singular at the points where the positions of two particles coincide .    the pairs @xmath136 and @xmath137 define two equivalent irreducible representations of the permutation group @xmath138 : for example , the pair @xmath136 transforms , under the six possible permutations , into @xmath136 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "therefore fully symmetric quantities are those of the form @xmath144 with @xmath145 .",
    "the pairs @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath137 all transform like @xmath136 . taking successive products of the above - mentioned representations of @xmath138 and decomposing them into irreducible representations ,",
    "it is straightforward to prove that all symmetric polynomials in @xmath148 can be expressed as polynomials in the following basic symmetric polynomials : @xmath149 the meaning of the subscripts is that @xmath150=p\\,c^{\\dagger}_{pq } , \\qquad [ l , c^{\\dagger}_{pq}]=q\\,c^{\\dagger}_{pq},\\ ] ] so @xmath151 changes the energy by @xmath152 and the angular momentum by @xmath153 .",
    "it remains to check for possible singularities at @xmath154 .",
    "all the @xmath113 states have the form , up to the gaussian factor @xmath155 , @xmath156^{\\nu } = p(u,\\bar{u},v,\\bar{v})(u^3-v^3)^{\\nu}\\ ] ] with @xmath157 a polynomial and @xmath158",
    ". therefore the only source of singularity can be differentiation of the last factor .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath159 , which involves @xmath160 only , is always regular , and so is @xmath128 ; hence , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are regular .",
    "now , @xmath163 shows that @xmath164 by itself may be singular , due to the last term .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath165 is regular .",
    "further , @xmath166 but @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are singular . a generic ( not normalized ) linear state of slope @xmath95 may then be written as @xmath170 with @xmath171 ( for the @xmath109 states , of course",
    ", @xmath172 would take the place of @xmath151 . )",
    "this is a classification of _ all _ linear three - anyon states ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , some of these states are tower excitations and some are different parts of the same trajectories .",
    "first , the operator @xmath173 is nothing but the tower raising operator .",
    "it never produces singularities when acting on any state , linear or nonlinear @xcite , thus providing the tower structure of the whole spectrum .",
    "hence put @xmath174 .",
    "second , note that @xmath175 and consequently @xmath176 \\psi_{00mn}(u , v;\\nu ) \\\\ & \\!\\!\\ ! = \\!\\!\\ !",
    "& 8(u^3-v^3)^2 \\psi_{00mn}(u , v;\\nu ) \\\\ & \\!\\!\\ ! = \\!\\!\\ !",
    "& 8\\psi_{00mn}(u , v;\\nu+2);\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , the wave functions ( [ 39 ] ) , being linearly independent for @xmath177 , are no longer so for @xmath178 , therefore some of them do not lead to new trajectories and should be excluded from the trajectory counting . as the last formula shows , it is sufficient to restrict to @xmath179 . thus , a bottom trajectory may be labeled by three numbers @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "this is completely equivalent to the labeling by @xmath114 , because it follows from ( [ 40])([41 ] ) that @xmath182 since the point of slope change to @xmath113 here is @xmath183 , and it is straightforward to see that for any point @xmath114 there is no more than one set @xmath184 such that these two equations are satisfied .",
    "the set of bottom trajectories being _ two_-parametric ( plus a `` double degeneracy '' due to @xmath4 ) is due to the fact that a bottom state is identified by _ three _ quantum numbers ( six degrees of freedom , minus two for the center of mass and one for the tower excitations ) .",
    "two quantum numbers ( say , @xmath185 and @xmath94 ) identify a trajectory , and the third one ( @xmath13 ) chooses a point on that trajectory . to compare , in the two - anyon problem , only _",
    "one _ quantum number , @xmath13 , is enough to identify a bottom state , consequently there is only one trajectory . in general , for the @xmath30-anyon problem , the family of trajectories will be @xmath186-parametric .",
    "let us return once more to fig .  1 ; there are two copies of one and the same two - dimensional pattern , made of bullets ( @xmath62 ) and triangles ( @xmath187 ) , and increasing @xmath3 or @xmath55 by 1 means moving within the pattern ( 3 units to the right and 3 units up , or 1 unit to the right and 3 units up , respectively ) .",
    "thus the counting of trajectories is complete , but to find the wave functions , certain modifications of eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) are still necessary .",
    "first , we need only such functions for which @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the tower lowering operator , but since @xmath190 does not commute with the @xmath191 s , even for @xmath174 some of the functions ( [ 39 ] ) will contain an admixture of non - bottom states with the same @xmath35 and @xmath13 . to correct for this ,",
    "it turns out to be sufficient to replace @xmath192 in ( [ 39 ] ) by another operator , writing @xmath193 where @xmath194^l \\label{43}\\ ] ] and @xmath195 is sen s supersymmetry operator @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath196 is symmetric , and it is straightforward to check that @xmath197 always [ @xmath190 commutes with @xmath198 and gives zero when acting on @xmath199 .",
    "also , @xmath200 changes @xmath35 and @xmath13 by the same amount as @xmath192 , so that the formulas ( [ 45 ] ) and ( [ 46 ] ) remain valid .",
    "second , a wave function that is continuous at the point @xmath114and thus corresponds to a trajectory  is , in general , not one of the form ( [ 42 ] ) but a linear combination of several functions of that form .",
    "indeed , for any fixed @xmath201 and @xmath202 we have @xmath203 degenerate @xmath95 states @xmath204 , where @xmath205 $ ] .",
    "these are linearly independent , but not orthogonal ; and which of their linear combinations to choose as a basis in the relevant @xmath203-dimensional subspace , makes no difference anywhere except at the point @xmath183 . here , the states with @xmath206 continue as linear to @xmath207 , and the basis in the relevant @xmath208-dimensional subspace may still be chosen at will , but one state `` decouples '' , i.e. , becomes nonlinear , and that is the one orthogonal to this subspace .",
    "in general , it will be not @xmath209 but a sum @xmath210 , where the numbers @xmath211 , @xmath206 , are determined by the @xmath208 orthogonality conditions . consider the simplest example @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath62 , which corresponds to the bosonic point @xmath214 , see fig .",
    "the two relevant states of the form ( [ 42 ] ) are @xmath215 and @xmath216 . at @xmath217",
    ", it makes no difference which two linear combinations of them to choose ; but at @xmath183 , @xmath218 continues to be linear , while the state which actually `` decouples '' and continues to @xmath207 as nonlinear , is the one orthogonal to @xmath218 at @xmath183 .",
    "an elementary calculation shows that it is @xmath219 .",
    "such reasoning has to be repeated at each bosonic point with @xmath220 , and general expressions for the coefficients @xmath221 apparently do not exist .",
    "we have shown that each trajectory is uniquely identified by its @xmath114 point ; the point being given , one should in principle be able to reconstruct the behavior of the whole trajectory , and in particular to find all the bosonic and fermionic points it passes through .",
    "in fact , it would be sufficient to find @xmath110 and the behavior between that point and @xmath114 [ where @xmath29 is nonlinear ] . to see whether this can be achieved , we plot the low - lying trajectories , using the exact multiplicities given in @xcite , on fig .",
    "( there are six different values of @xmath15 and consequently six plots , one for each class of trajectories . )",
    "the nonlinear pieces are shown schematically only .",
    "the continuity of the trajectories is confirmed by the fact that at bosonic and fermionic points , where they cross , the total number of trajectories coming from the left and from the right is always the same .",
    "the main question is how to identify which piece on the left is a continuation of which piece on the right .",
    "if at a certain crossing point perturbation theory works and the first - order corrections to energy are different for all the states involved , then the rule is that the order of trajectories , by increasing energy , on the right is opposite to that on the left ( because the first - order corrections have opposite signs ) .",
    "this argument does not work ( a ) if the first - order corrections to some of the states are equal and ( b ) when perturbation theory breaks down , at certain bosonic points , as mentioned above . a way out then is to find the wave functions numerically , using the method of @xcite and to identify them by comparing their limits as the crossing point is approached . as it appears , the above rule ",
    "the trajectory which is the @xmath4-th from above on the left is the @xmath4-th from below on the right",
    " holds for all crossings analyzed . in other words ,",
    "all crossings appear to be _ true _ crossings .",
    "when this rule is used , it becomes possible to identify the trajectories completely without actually finding the wave functions .",
    "it turns out that for all the trajectories there is at most one point of slope change , apart from @xmath114 and @xmath110 , which we denote by @xmath222 , the change being from @xmath101 to @xmath102 as @xmath13 increases through @xmath223 ; clearly , @xmath224 .",
    "a generic behavior of a trajectory is , therefore , @xmath225 ( numbers on top of the arrows meaning slopes ) , but in fact it may be @xmath226 or @xmath227 ( for the ground state , @xmath228 ) .",

    "one can verify the compatibility of ( [ n+])([n- ] ) with ( [ b+3])([b+1 ] ) ; also , a simple consistency check comes from the symmetry requirement  a trajectory @xmath241 must have its partner @xmath242 : this is satisfied as well .",
    "note that @xmath243 depends continuously on @xmath94 , but there is a discontinuity in @xmath244 at the point @xmath245 .",
    "also , the exact results exhibit certain periodic structure with period 8 by @xmath185 and 4 by @xmath94 . explaining these features remains an open item .    a semiclassical interpretation  rather rough , although  of some features of the trajectories may be adduced .",
    "when two particles are close together and the third one is far from them , that is , say , @xmath246 [ @xmath247 , one gets two independent anyonic oscillators , one ( @xmath248 ) with the statistics parameter @xmath5 , the other ( @xmath249 ) with the parameter @xmath250 @xcite .",
    "the energy in this approximation is @xmath251 , where in general @xmath252 ; as @xmath5 increases through @xmath253 , the slope changes from @xmath109 to @xmath101 ( if @xmath254 ) or from @xmath102 to @xmath113 ( if @xmath255 ) ; the other two points of change , however , can not be described correctly , nor can the formulas ( [ n+])([n- ] ) be explained .",
    "perhaps a more accurate semiclassical approximation would be able to explain them .",
    "we have developed the concept of trajectories for anyons , noting that many different many - anyon states are in fact continuations of each other .",
    "we discuss in particular the harmonic oscillator external potential . apart from the center - of - mass and tower excitations , in the two - anyon problem",
    "there is only one trajectory .",
    "for the three - anyon problem , we have worked out the classification and the main features of the trajectories : the slope of a trajectory always changes as @xmath256 ( where the @xmath102 and/or @xmath101 pieces may be missing ) , and the point @xmath114 of the last change may be used to label the trajectory .",
    "the wave function corresponding to the linear part of the trajectory can be written down exactly by applying excitation operators to the ground trajectory .",
    "concerning the nonlinear part , we conjecture the formulas , based on a numerical analysis , expressing the lengths of intervals of slope @xmath101 and @xmath102 in terms of @xmath114 .",
    "qualitatively , the picture will be the same for the @xmath30-anyon problem : again , each trajectory will have the points @xmath114 and @xmath110 such that its @xmath29 dependence is linear with slopes @xmath108 for @xmath96 ( @xmath99 ) and nonlinear in between . here",
    "the family of trajectories will be @xmath186-parametric .",
    "it is quite plausible that in this case as well , the sequence of slopes will be regular , from @xmath257 up to @xmath258 in steps of two .",
    "however , to gain a more precise understanding of the behavior of the trajectories remains an open problem .",
    "s.  m. would like to express his sincere thanks to the institutt for fysikk at the nth , trondheim , and the theory division of the institut de physique nuclaire , orsay , where parts of this work were done , for the kind hospitality and support .",
