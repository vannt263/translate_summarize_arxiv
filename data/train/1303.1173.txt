    "thus , the charge and the energy are localized inside the ball with the center at the origin @xmath17 .    in a solvable model , one can find the whole spectrum of excitations above a q - ball solution , examine the modes responsible for possible instabilities and , in addition , demonstrate explicitly the validity of the stability conditions for q - balls , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can examine linear perturbations above a q - ball solution in analogy with @xcite , where instability of the solution in a theory with potential of the form @xmath18 was established numerically .",

    "because of the simplicity of potential ( [ potential ] ) , such solutions can also be found analytically .",
    "it would be interesting to examine their properties in comparison with those of the simplest solution presented above , but this topic lies beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "one sees that the scalar field potential is unbounded from below if @xmath28 .",

    "we consider small perturbations above the classical solution of the form @xmath71 formally , the linearized equation of motion takes the form @xmath72 which can be easily brought to the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 it is worth mentioning that the mixing between @xmath75 and @xmath76 occurs for potential ( [ potential ] ) only at the points @xmath77 through the term with the @xmath78 function and this fact really simplifies the consideration .",
    "there are two obvious solutions to equation ( [ perturb ] ) .",

    "\\label{stab_system}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 .",
    "it should be noted that formally the case @xmath84 should be considered separately , because in this case there is no separation of the equation ( [ perturb ] ) into terms proportional to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which results in two different equations presented above .",
    "but it appears that the equation for the spectrum , which will be obtained from ( [ stab_system ] ) , is also valid for the case @xmath84 .",
    "first , let us consider normalized solutions to equations ( [ stab_system ] ) .",
    "they take the form @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "note that if the conditions @xmath95 , @xmath96 are not fulfilled , the solutions do not fall off at spatial infinity and thus such solutions are not normalizable .    it is convenient to consider modes which are even and odd in @xmath97 separately from the very beginning . in the first case we have @xmath98 .",
    "the matching condition at the point @xmath99 , coming from ( [ perturb ] ) , looks as follows : @xmath100 the condition ( [ matching ] ) together with the continuity of @xmath75 at the point @xmath99 generate the characteristic equation on @xmath101 .",
    "after some calculations ( which are straightforward but quite tedious and we do not present the details of calculations here ) , we can get the following characteristic equation for the spectrum : @xmath102 where @xmath103 @xmath104 note that equation ( [ spectrum ] ) can be used only if the conditions @xmath105 are fulfilled . in this case",
    "@xmath75 falls off exponentially with @xmath106 and we have normalized solutions .",
    "otherwise ( i.e. if @xmath107 and @xmath108 or @xmath109 ) one should consider a more general form of perturbations in order to describe modes from the continuous spectrum .",
    "analogous calculations can be made for the odd modes , for which @xmath110 .",
    "the matching condition again has the form ( [ matching ] ) and we get equation ( [ spectrum ] ) , but now with @xmath111 @xmath112 these formulas also can be used only if ( [ cond1 ] ) or ( [ cond2 ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "it is interesting to note that , according to ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) , the unstable mode ( if exists ) is normalized .",
    "as already mentioned , the non - normalized modes from the continuous spectrum exist if @xmath113 and if @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "now let us turn to an examination of the discrete spectrum of our model .",
    "first , it is necessary to note that there exist obvious solutions to equation ( [ spectrum ] ) in the case of the odd modes .",
    "indeed , if @xmath113 , these solutions to ( [ spectrum ] ) are simply @xmath116 or @xmath117 , which leads to @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "but it can be shown that for these values of @xmath101 the only solution to the initial system of linearized equations of motion is @xmath122 .",
    "thus , these roots are unphysical .",
    "note that depending on the value of @xmath123 these roots corresponding to unphysical modes may formally lie in the continuous spectrum .",
    "equation ( [ spectrum ] ) was examined numerically for @xmath26 .",
    "we have failed to find solutions to ( [ spectrum ] ) for @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "for the case @xmath113 we have found that solutions to equation ( [ spectrum ] ) may exist ( or may not exist ) depending on the value of @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath84 and @xmath125 was examined separately for different values of @xmath123 .",
    "we have failed to find any exponentially growing odd mode . for @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the frequency of the q - ball solution corresponding to the minimal charge and energy ( for @xmath26",
    "this frequency is @xmath128 ) , only one exponentially growing even mode was found ( it is evident that modes with nonzero imaginary part of @xmath101 correspond to classical instability ) .",
    "for @xmath129 we have failed to find any exponentially growing even mode .",
    "thus , the numerical analysis shows that the upper ( `` wide '' ) branch in fig .",

    "an important remark concerning the validity of the linear approximation is in order .",

    "it is clear that the relation @xmath152 should hold in order not to break down the linear approximation . in the limit @xmath153 ( which is exactly the case for which the linearized equation ( [ perturb ] ) was obtained ) , this relation obviously leads to the constraint @xmath154 , otherwise formally we get the breakdown of the linear approximation .",
    "thus , let us consider the linearized theory with the constraint @xmath155 substituting ( [ subst - lin ] ) into ( [ constraint ] ) and taking into account the fact that the relation ( [ constraint ] ) should hold at any moment of time , we get @xmath156 now we take the first equation of ( [ stab_system ] ) .",
    "taking into account ( [ eq48 ] ) , it can be rewritten as @xmath157 and @xmath158 where the operator @xmath159 is defined as @xmath160 . multiplying ( [ l1 ] ) by @xmath161 , integrating over the coordinate @xmath97 and using ( [ l2 ] ) , we get @xmath162 the latter equation has two solutions .",
    "the first one leads to @xmath113 , which means that exponentially growing modes , indicating instability , are absent in this case .",
    "the second solution is @xmath163 , where @xmath164 .",
    "using ( [ l1 ] ) , we easily obtain @xmath165 but this relation can not be fulfilled , because @xmath166 is nonnegative for any @xmath167 .",
    "indeed , the eigenfunction of the operator @xmath159 , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath168 , is @xmath169 .",
    "this eigenfunction has no nodes , which means that it is the lowest mode and thus all other eigenvalues are also larger than zero , leading to non - negativity of @xmath166 .",
    "analogous calculations , leading to the same result , can be performed for the function @xmath170 .",
    "thus , we have shown that formally there are no modes indicating instability if constraint ( [ constraint ] ) is imposed . meanwhile",
    ", this constraint is a consequence of the existence of a generalized function in our potential .",
    "a physically reasonable potential should be smooth , leading to nonzero , though sometimes very small , amplitude of perturbations .",
    "it this case in the linearized equations of motion ( [ perturb ] ) delta - function should be replaced by some smooth function containing some parameter of regularization @xmath149 ( like the one in ( [ regularization ] ) ) .",
    "for very large , but finite @xmath149 , the linearized equation of motion , as well as corresponding solutions for perturbations and eigenvalues @xmath101 , may look very similar to those in the @xmath153 limiting case . of course , most probably such an equation can not be solved analytically .",
    "but the difference between the exact solution and the solution in the @xmath153 limiting case is controlled by the parameter @xmath171 , and for very large @xmath149 the corrections to the case @xmath153 are supposed to be very small .",
    "this reasoning justifies the use of the `` relaxed '' linearized theory described by equation ( [ perturb ] ) , without constraint ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "this `` relaxed '' theory allows one to see what could happen with the stability in a more realistic case of a smooth scalar field potential .",
    "in the present paper we discussed q - ball solutions in a model describing complex scalar field with a piecewise parabolic potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "it was shown that due to the simplicity of the potential q - ball solutions can be found analytically , which really simplifies the analysis of their properties  the spectra of solutions were obtained analytically in ( 3 + 1)- and ( 1 + 1)-dimensional space - times for different values of the parameters of the model .",
    "for @xmath172 the q - ball solutions are very close to the condensate line @xmath64 and this fact can be interesting for examining the q - ball production .",
    "it should be noted that the q - ball solutions presented in this paper can not be described by the standard thin - wall approximation .",
    "the stability of the obtained solutions was also examined . in the simpler theory in @xmath31-dimensional space - time it was shown explicitly that solutions with @xmath136 are always unstable , whereas solutions @xmath130 do not contain exponentially growing modes , at least of the simplest form @xmath173 .",
    "though the potential ( [ potential ] ) is very simple , it provides a variety of q - ball solutions of different types .",
    "we hope that the existence of exact and simple analytical q - ball solutions with known properties ( such as their stability and @xmath59 dependence ) allows one to consider the model , presented in this paper , as a useful tool for examining different phenomenological scenarios involving q - balls .",

    "<S> such a potential provides a variety of solutions which were thoroughly examined . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that , depending on the values of the parameters of the model and according to the known stability criteria , there exist stable and unstable solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the classical stability of solutions in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional space - time was examined in the linear approximation and it was shown explicitly that the spectrum of linear perturbations around some solutions contains exponentially growing modes while it is not so for other solutions . </S>"
