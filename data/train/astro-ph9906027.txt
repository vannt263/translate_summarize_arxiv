    "in recent cosmological observations , the following three remarkable phenomena have been discovered , which may contradict with the homogeneity of the universe .",
    "one of them is the large - scale bulk flows in the region with distance @xmath4 mpc  @xmath5 km",
    "sec@xmath6 mpc@xmath7 without the associated large cmb dipole anisotropy @xcite .",
    "second we have the inhomogeneity of the observed hubble constant whose values are smaller in the measurements for remoter sources @xcite .",
    "the last one is the magnitude - redshift relation of snia , in which the observed magnitudes of sources are larger than those expected in the homogeneous friedmann models without the cosmological constant . for the model - fitting the positive cosmological constant which brings",
    "an `` accelerating '' universe was considered as a necessary quantity @xcite .",
    "for the explanation of the first phenomenon we considered spherically symmetric inhomogeneous models in a previous paper @xcite , which is cited as paper i in the following .",
    "they consist of inner and outer homogeneous regions connected with a single shell , double shells or an intermediate self - similar region ( tomita 1996 , 1995 ) , and it is assumed that the density and hubble parameters in the inner region are smaller and larger , respectively , than those in the outer region . then it was shown that the observed situation of bulk flows and cmb dipole anisotropy can be reproduced , if the radius of the boundary of the two region and the observer s position from the center are about @xmath8 mpc and @xmath9 mpc , respectively .",
    "the consistency with the observed bulk flows @xcite was shown in paper i. these models are found to be consistent also with the observed inhomogeneity of the hubble constant .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the hubble constant has already been discussed by various workers ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the local void region with higher hubble constant was studied independently by @xcite as the local hubble bubble , which has the scale @xmath10 mpc and is bordered by the dense walls as the great attractor .",
    "they analyzed the statistical relation between the distances and the local hubble constants derived from the data of snia , and found the existence of a void region with a local hubble constant larger than the global hubble constant .",
    "the relation to the snia data on the scale @xmath11 mpc will be discussed in this paper from our standpoint .    in the present paper the behavior of the distances",
    "is investigated in the models in the previous paper with similar model parameters . in  2 , we treat the distances from a virtual observer who is in the center of the inner void - like region in models with a single shell , and derive the [ magnitude @xmath12 - redshift @xmath2 ] relation .",
    "this relation is compared with the counterpart in the homogeneous models .",
    "then the relation in the present models is found to deviate from that in the homogeneous models with @xmath14 at the stage of @xmath15 .",
    "it is partially similar to that in the nonzero-@xmath16 homogeneous models , but the remarkable difference appears at the high - redshift stage @xmath17 . in  3 , we consider a realistic observer who is in the position deviated from the center , and calculate the distances from him .",
    "the distances depend on the direction of incident light and the area angular diameter distance is different from the linear angular diameter distances .",
    "it is shown as the result that the [ @xmath18 relation is anisotropic , but the relation averaged with respect to the angle is very near to the relation by the virtual observer .",
    "the comparison with the observed relation for snia is also discussed . in ",
    "4 we derive the lens effect such as the convergence and shear of the images caused by the above anisotropic nature of distances , and in  5 discuss the influence on the time - delay from a remote double quasar .  6",

    "a , the derivation of distances in models with double shells is described in parallel with  2 and  3 .",

    "<S> we study the distances and gravitational lensing in spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological models consisting of inner and outer homogeneous regions which are connected by a single shell or double shells at the redshift @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the density and hubble parameters in the inner region are assumed to be smaller and larger , respectively , than those in the outer region . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that at the stage @xmath1 the distances from an observer in the inner void - like region are larger than the counterparts ( with equal @xmath2 ) in the corresponding homogeneous friedmann models , and hence the magnitudes for the sources at this stage are larger . </S>",
    "<S> this effect of the void - like low - density region may explain the deviations of the observed [ magnitude - redshift ] relation of snia from the relation in homogeneous models , independently of the cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> when the position of the observer deviates from the center , moreover , it is shown that the distances are anisotropic and the images of remote sources are systematically deformed . </S>",
    "<S> the above relation at @xmath3 and this anisotropy will observationally distinguish the role of the above void - like region from that of the positive cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> the influence on the time - delay measurement is also discussed . </S>"
