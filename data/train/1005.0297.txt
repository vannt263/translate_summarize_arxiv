    "each of the three allotropes of iron possess interesting magnetic properties which have a profound influence on their stability.@xcite the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) form is ferromagnetic;@xcite the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) fe at low temperatures is antiferromagnetic,@xcite but its higher energy ferromagnetic state can be thermally excited with complex variations in magnetic structure as a function of temperature.@xcite ferromagnetism is eliminated when bcc iron transforms into the hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) crystal structure at high pressures @xmath3gpa.@xcite    density - functional theory has been proven to be reliable in estimating the magnetic properties of iron - based transition - metal alloys , for example the pioneering work by akai _ _ et al.__@xcite who used the korringar - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green s function method based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) , and anismov _ et al._,@xcite who used the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) green s function method to obtain a consistent picture of the electronic and magnetic structures of @xmath0 impurities in bcc fe . however , the lsda is known to underestimate exchange effects,@xcite which are crucial for determining magnetism .",
    "furthermore , lattice optimization , which may affect the electronic and magnetic structures of the impurity and host , was not taken into account in these previous calculations .",
    "lattice optimization may not change the general conclusions drawn previously , but can give more quantitative information .",
    "the relative stability of @xmath0 impurities in bcc fe is also important for practical implementations in the steel industry which can be precisely calculated at the optimized lattice parameters and for this purpose , the lattice parameters of the @xmath0 impurities are also optimized .",
    "we focus also on the magnetic interactions between impurity and the host element which can give a detailed picture of the magnetism of impurities in bcc fe .",
    "the purpose of the present work was to use the highly precise all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) method@xcite based on the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite to study the magnetic and electronic structures and hyperfine fields of fe where it is substitutionally alloyed with the @xmath0 transition metals .",

    "all core electrons were at first treated fully relativistically and valence states scalar relativistically , _",

    "the explicit orthogonalization ( xo ) scheme was employed to ensure the orthogonality between the core and valence states.@xcite    all atoms were fully relaxed at each lattice volume until the atomic forces on each atom were less than @xmath18 the equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli @xmath19 were determined by fitting the total energy and volume to the birch - murnaghan equation of states.@xcite using the optimized lattice constants , further calculations were carried out in the spin - unpolarized and spin - polarized states with and without soc .",
    "self - consistency was assumed when the difference between input and output charge densities became less than @xmath20electrons / a.u.@xmath21 note that all the computational parameters used in the present calculations satisfy the convergence test.@xcite",

    "the optimized lattice constant of pure bcc fe is @xmath22 , which is only @xmath23% smaller than that of the finite temperature experimental value @xmath24.@xcite it is interesting to find out that the all the substitutional @xmath0 impurities in bcc fe increases the lattice parameter .",

    "positive values imply that the hyperfine field of fe@xmath32 neighbor is smaller than that of the host and vice versa .",

    "this discrepancy is due to partly the different computational method .",
    "our calculated gga trend of @xmath33 can be compared with the experimental observations and the other previous calculations.@xcite    the @xmath34 results in table  [ table - b ] show that @xmath35 of fe1 is negative for all the @xmath0 impurities except for cr , and these positive quantities increase the transfer field of the fe1 atoms through its proportionality to the magnetic moment of the surrounding atoms , _",

    "finally , some test calculations were also carried out for big and small supercells of fe@xmath44ni@xmath45 and fe@xmath46ni and the local properties around ni were similar to fe@xmath7ni .",

    "the results compare favorably with existing experimental data , and have been contrasted with published calculations where available .",
    "the lattice parameters were optimized and it is shown that the lattice constant decreases with the atomic number of the impurity @xmath1 ( sc  fe ) , whereas it increases for co  zn .",
    "the calculated formation energy results are good agreement with the alloying experiences in steels design .",
    "it is found that iron induces a magnetic moment at the sc , ti , v , cu , and zn atoms substituted into the iron lattice ; sc , ti , v , cr , and zn couple antiferromagnetically with iron , resulting in an overall reduction in the saturation magnetization relative to pure iron .",
    "in contrast , co , and ni couple ferromagnetically with iron and resulting in increase in saturation magnetization .",
    "the trend of the atom averaged magnetic moment versus effective atomic number is shown to lie on the left branch of the well - known slater - pauling curve , but it is not simply linear  the deviation from the standard slater - pauling curve is attributed by the nature of the weak ferromagnetism of bcc iron .",
    "these results have been interpreted by examining in detail the local density of states , near neighbor interactions , and other features of the electronic structure of the alloys resulting from the substitution of impurity atoms into iron .",
    "an important outcome is that calculations of the type reported here are not significantly influenced by spin - orbit coupling . the calculated fermi contact hyperfine fields also support this conclusion . in the light of previous theoretical calculations , where lsda was used our calculations",
    "showed that although lsda can not describe the correct magnetic properties of bcc fe , but can describe the correct magnetic properties ( qualitatively ) of bcc fe because our gga results are close to the previous lsda results . comparing the lsda and gga , we showed that the gga results are closer to the experimental data .",
