    "it has been known for decades that the gaseous disk of our galaxy displays coherent vertical distortions ( kerr 1957 ; gum , kerr & westerhout 1960 ) . in particular , for locations inside the solar circle , a wavy structure has been observed in the vertical distribution of several interstellar tracers , including the atomic and ionized components ( lockman 1977 ; sanders , solomon & scoville 1984 ; spicker & feitzinger 1986 ; malhotra 1995 ) , and young stellar objects ( dixon 1967 ; alfaro 1992a , b ; berdnikov & efremov 1993 ) .",
    "these undulations , distributed above and below the mean galactic plane and in both the azimuthal and radial directions , have been termed as `` corrugations '' , and they seem to be common features appearing in disk galaxies . they have also been detected in both the gaseous and stellar disks of other spiral galaxies such as m31 ( arp 1964 ) , ngc 4244 , and ngc 5023 ( florido 1991 ) .    their origin could be ascribed to either well localized features , such as spiral arms and collisions with high - velocity clouds ( hvc ) , or large scale perturbations , such as gravitational interactions . for instance , some authors have explored the possibility of undulations along spiral arms , induced by magneto - gravitational instabilities ( nelson 1985 ; gmez de castro & pudritz 1992 ; kim 1997 ; franco 2000 ) . in this case",
    ", the arms are corrugated by the undular mode ( parker 1966 ) of the instability , and the structuring occurs @xmath1 in the azimuthal direction ( a possible association to the radial patterns could be made if one assumes that these are the projection of the azimuthal corrugations on the radial direction ) .",
    "another localized origin could be ascribed to collisions of hvc with the disk of a galaxy : hvc impacts could cause the midplane disk to oscillate in a mode of wavy patterns as well ( franco 1988 ; santilln 1999 ) . in the large scale scenario ,",
    "the undulations represent the natural response of the disk , which behaves like a loose drumhead , to the perturbations induced either by some companion galaxies or other galactic subsystems ( weinberg 1991 ; edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ) .",
    "one obvious inference is that these corrugations should be associated with equally undulated coherent motions , and models addressing the vertical displacements also show wave - like @xmath2-velocity fields with amplitudes of the order of tens of km  s@xmath3 ( nelson 1976 , 1985 ; franco 1989 , 2000 ; edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ; kim 1997 ; santilln 2000 ) . despite this expectation ,",
    "however , the data about actual velocity features associated with spatial corrugations are scarce .",
    "the observational evidence for small - scale distortions in the vertical velocity fields of disk galaxies comes from the so - called _ rolling motions _ in our galaxy ( observed in the @xmath4 plots of the hi galactic distribution ; yuan & wallace 1973 ; feitzinger & spicker 1985 ) , the velocity field of the ionized gas in m 51 ( goad , de veny & goad 1979 ) , rotation curves of some spirals ( pismis 1965 ; rubin , ford & thonnard 1980 ) , and optical and radio isovelocity maps of some field galaxies ( bosma 1978 ; pismis 1986 ) .",
    "in particular , the study of the velocity field of the ionized gas in m 51 performed by goad , de veny & goad ( 1979 ) suggests that part of the observed nonrotational velocities could be due to motions perpendicular to the plane of the disk .",
    "pismis ( 1965 , 1986 ) , on the other hand , has pointed out the relevance of analyzing the location of the velocity undulations in the rotation curve with respect to the spiral structure of the host galaxy .",
    "clearly , all this kinematic information may be important in our understanding of corrugations .",
    "in this paper we report the detection of a corrugated velocity field in the ionized gas of the nearly face - on spiral ngc 5427 .",
    "the central velocity of the h@xmath0 emission line shows velocity shifts with similar behavior when the gas passes through the spiral arms .",
    "this behavior can be understood as due to a hydraulic jump , or bore , generated by the interaction of the spiral density wave with the gas of a thick gaseous disk , as discussed by martos & cox ( 1998 , hereafter mc ) and martos ( 1999 ) . the detection of this velocity pattern in ngc 5427 does not answer the current questions about the morphogenesis of corrugations , but represents a powerful tool to explore further the theoretical and observational aspects of the problem .",
    "the paper has been organized in three sections , the first one being this introduction ; section 2 is devoted to the description of the observations and reduction procedure and , finally , in section 3 , we discuss the results and outline the main conclusions .",
    "ngc  5427 is a nearly face - on spiral , interacting with the spiral ngc  5426 .",
    "the two galaxies in this binary system have the same morphological classification , sa(s)c , in the rc2 ( de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs & corwin 1976 ) , and they are cataloged as object 276 in the atlas of arp ( 1966 ) , and object 21 in the catalogue of vorontsov - velyaminov ( 1959 ) .",
    "the system has been studied photometric and spectroscopically by blackman ( 1982 ) .",
    "the inclination of ngc  5427 with respect to the plane of the sky is about 30@xmath5 , and the position angle for the line of nodes is about 70@xmath5 ( blackman 1982 ; grosbol 1985 ) .",
    "the star formation properties of ngc 5427 are studied by gonzlez - delgado & prez ( 1992 , 1997 ) and gonzlez - delgado ( 1997 ) , who have analyzed the h@xmath0 emission and the luminosity and size distribution functions .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 5427 is classified as a seyfert type 2 , and colina ( 1997 ) have studied the relative importance of the circumnuclear star formation and nuclear activity .",
    "the observations were done with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , during a director s service night , 18 march 1990 .",
    "we used the red arm of the isis spectrograph with an eev ccd chip and the grating r600 . a spectral range of 900   was covered with a dispersion of 0.74   pixel@xmath3 , centered at 6560  .",
    "the sampling along the spatial direction is 0.33 arcsec  pixel@xmath3 , equivalent to 56 pc / pixel , for ngc 5427 . ]",
    "thus for @xmath6 , the scale is 170 pc arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "an exposure of 2000 s was secured through a 4 arcmin long , 1 arcsec wide slit at a position angle of 45@xmath5 across the nucleus ( fig .",
    "the data were reduced using the figaro data processing software .",
    "bias and flat - fielding were performed in the usual way .",
    "a two dimensional wavelength calibration was done using the program arc2d ( wilkins & axon 1991 ) by fitting a third order polynomial to the position of the lines in the calibration lamp frames ; the rms deviation from the fits was less than 0.1  .",
    "the fwhm of the sky lines [ o i ] @xmath76300,6363 measured in the wavelength calibrated frame of ngc 5427 is 1.51@xmath80.06   and 1.57@xmath80.08  , thus the spectral resolution is better than 1.6  .",
    "the spectrum was flux calibrated using a flux standard observed through a very wide slit , and the sky background subtracted .",
    "we used the program longslit ( wilkins & axon 1991 ) to interactively perform a gaussian fit to the emission lines along the slit .",
    "the program output includes the position and intensity of the emission lines , together with the respective fitting errors .",
    "the rms error in velocity due to the wavelength calibration is 1.3 km  s@xmath3 , smaller than errors in the gaussian fit . in the subsequent manipulation of the data ,",
    "we propagate the errors accordingly .",
    "the final errors are shown in figures 2a , b where the main contribution comes from the gaussian fit uncertainties .",
    "figure 2a shows the deprojected radial velocity of ngc  5427 , v@xmath9 , together with the full intensity curves for the emission line h@xmath0 along the slit .",
    "the velocity curve has been corrected for the galaxy systemic motion , the projection with respect to the plane of the sky ( 30@xmath5 ) and the p.a . of the line of nodes ( 70@xmath5 ) .",
    "our data is more extended towards the north - east , away from the interaction zone with ngc  5426 .",
    "the southern half of ngc  5427 is significantly affected by the presence of ngc  5426 but , in contrast , the northern half of the galaxy does not show any significant structural perturbation and seems to be relatively undisturbed .",
    "thus , the north - south velocity asymmetries are likely due to the perturbation induced by ngc  5426 .",
    "the asymmetry in the star forming properties is also interesting , and it has been discussed by blackman ( 1982 ) and gonzlez - delgado & prez ( 1992 ) .",
    "the figure shows a remarkably well defined wave - like structure in the central velocity , superimposed to a gentle rise towards the north - east .",
    "figure 2b shows the variations in the deprojected velocity @xmath10 ( see below ) , when the slit passes through the 3 spiral features located at galactocentric distances from 5 to 10 kpc in the north - east .",
    "the amplitude of the variations @xmath11v@xmath9 is in the range @xmath12 for the three main features . in this figure",
    ", the velocity has been de - trended by fitting a linear component to the gentle rise , and is presented upside - down with respect to fig .",
    "2a : so that blueshifted material is seen higher in the velocity axis .",
    "the cross - correlation of the velocity and intensity curves for these three features shows that the peak velocities are displaced from the peak intensities by the same distance in all three cases .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 ( full line ) , together with the auto - correlations for the velocity ( dotted ) and intensity ( dashed ) curves : a negative lag indicates a shift toward smaller galactocentric distances .",
    "the fwhm of the auto - correlation functions is 560 pc for the intensity , and 910 pc for the velocity .",
    "the velocity versus intensity cross - correlation function is slightly asymmetrical , with a peak at 300 pc and a full width at zero intensity centroid at 500 pc .",
    "thus the displacement between the peak velocities and the arm peak intensities amounts to about a half of the arm width .",
    "an inspection of the wpfc2 image from the hst archive , taken through the f606w filter ( figure 4 ) shows the location of the dust lanes along the spiral arms . in the central regions ( inside @xmath13 arcsec ) , the dust lanes are located in the concave ( interior ) side of the spiral arms . for the regions external to 25 arcsec , however , the position of the dust lanes depends on the interaction with ngc  5426 . for the ne region , which is relatively unperturbed and",
    "the residual velocity curve is better defined , the dust lanes are clearly located in the convex ( exterior ) side of the arms .",
    "in contrast , the heavily perturbed sw region displays a different pattern and , even as far as 50 arcsecs away the center , the dust lanes appear in the concave ( interior ) side of the arm .",
    "these north - south asymmetries , as stated above , are due to the velocity perturbations induced by ngc  5426 and the co - rotation radius can not be defined in a unique form in this galaxy . for the purposes of the present study , however , we restrict the analysis to the relatively unperturbed ne region and use the location of the dust lanes to infer the direction of gas flow through the arms .",
    "the wavy structure of @xmath11v@xmath9 represents the projection of the residual galactic velocity on the line of sight , once corrected from systemic and rotational velocities .",
    "the system velocity has been estimated at the position of the maximum emission at the core .",
    "@xmath11v@xmath9 can be written in terms of the inclination angle , @xmath14 , and the angle between the position vector and the line of nodes , @xmath15 , as @xmath16 and assuming that the parallel component is only due to rotation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the galactocentric radius , v@xmath19 is the vertical velocity component , and @xmath20 is the angular rotation speed in the local galactic frame . according to this expression there are three main factors ( or any combination of them ) that could be producing the undulation of the residual velocity : ( i ) the galactic disk is not planar and @xmath14 changes with galactocentric radius .",
    "( ii ) the galaxy has a corrugated vertical velocity component .",
    "( iii ) the rotation curve of the gas is accelerated and decelerated in a cyclic way .",
    "the inclination of ngc  5427 ( @xmath2130@xmath5 ) is small enough to place vertical motions nearly on the line of sight and yet large enough to exhibit the rotational motions . from the second term in eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , and even when a good fraction of the velocity corrugation is likely vertical , one can not discard the presence of velocity components parallel to the disk .",
    "figure 2b shows that the approaching ( negative values ) peaks in @xmath22 occur in the convex border of the arms , whereas the receding maxima ( positive values ) are located behind the h@xmath0 emission maxima , in the concave side .",
    "an approaching velocity means that the gas is either flowing up to higher galactic latitudes , or the rotation velocity is decelerating . on the other hand , the receding velocities indicate that the gas is either falling down onto the galactic plane , or is accelerating .",
    "given that the fhwm of the velocity auto - correlation function is almost twice the fwhm of the h@xmath0 intensity auto - correlation , it seems as if the gas flow is decelerating and jumping above the arm and depositing material in the concave side .",
    "this behavior is similar to the response of a gas flow into a spiral density wave in a thick and magnetized gaseous disk , as recently discussed by mc .",
    "they found that the gas entering a spiral arm rises suddenly on the upstream side of the arm , then accelerates and bends downward , finally landing on a large downfall region downstream of the arm .",
    "figure 5 illustrates this dynamical behavior for case 28 of mc , in which the radial extent of the arm is 1 kpc .",
    "the center of the horizontal axis , @xmath23 , corresponds to the minimum of the potential well ; @xmath2 is the vertical distance above the midplane , and the magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the @xmath24 plane , along the long axis of the arm .",
    "the upstream ascent and downstream downfall of the gas above the arm are so predicted by the model in this numerical mhd simulation .",
    "this scenario fits quite well the phenomenology that we find in ngc 5427 .",
    "the observed deprojected velocity amplitudes are of the same order as the ones found by mc .",
    "figure 5 shows that one should expect that the approaching velocity maxima would appear in the upstream side of the arms ; for ngc  5427 these maxima are located in the convex borders .",
    "thus , if the observed velocity pattern is induced by a spiral density wave the gas is entering the arm through the convex side , what can only occur outward of the co - rotation radius in a trailing arm .",
    "this is supported by the geometrical arguments described above .",
    "thus , the main features observed in the radial corrugated velocity pattern seem to be explained by the perturbations originated in the velocity field pattern of gas encountering a spiral arm .",
    "such a velocity field occurs on both sides of the galactic midplane , generating doubled emission lines .",
    "the relative strengths of these two components depend on the relative position of the gas centroid with respect to the center of the spiral potential minimum , but the extinction through the disk and the low emissivity of gas in the interarm regions can make it difficult to detect , or separate , the emission generated on the far side of the disk .",
    "the optical thickness of spiral galaxies is highly variable across the disk ; it is optically thin in most parts of the interarm regions and much more opaque along the arms , particularly in the dust patches ( e.  g. disney , davies & phillipps 1989 ; marziani 1999 ) .",
    "our spectroscopic data passing through the three spiral features of the ne region could reach visual extinctions between 1 - 4 magnitudes ( marziani 1999 ) . at present",
    "we can not provide specific extintion values along the arms , but it is possible that the h@xmath0 emission generated at the back side is below our detection limit .",
    "the opacity in the interarm regions is certainly much lower , but the emissivity of the ionized gas is also much smaller and the signal to noise ratio is accordingly lower . nonetheless , there is a hint that we may be detecting some of the far side emission because the fwhm of the emission lines increases in the high velocity features .",
    "figure 6 shows that the emission with @xmath25 km s@xmath3 has larger dispersion values , but the low signal to noise ratio prevents us to discern between foreground and background velocity peaks ( we thank the referee for pointing out this possibility ) .",
    "more work with higher quality data is needed to conclusively resolve this issue .",
    "even though the galactic bore model seems to provide a very appealing explanation to the observed velocity corrugations in ngc  5427 , other mechanisms could also be inducing or enhancing the corrugations of the velocity field . the fact that this galaxy is a member of an interacting pair ,",
    "whose companion has a mass similar or larger than ngc 5427 , makes it likely that the perturbations originated by the tidal interaction will largely affect the velocity field , producing corrugated patterns ( edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the azimuthal corrugations in the arms originated by magneto - gravitational instabilities ( franco 2000 ) must also be present and superimposed with the other deviations of the velocity field .",
    "we notice , however , that the velocity field resulting from the parker instability will be esentially that of a downfall ( towards the midplane ) along the bent magnetic field lines , and not the rising and falling motions expected from the galactic bore picture .    summarizing , here we report the detection of a corrugated velocity pattern in the disk of ngc  5427 .",
    "a detailed analysis of this velocity structure shows a remarkable good qualitative agreement between the observed features and those derived from the galactic bore model described by mc and martos ( 1999 ) .",
    "given that the only requirements for this mechanism to work are the existence of a spiral density wave and a magnetic field ( with a strength similar to those observed in our galaxy ; see mc and discussion therein ) , the generation of radial velocity corrugations must be a common occurrence in spiral galaxies .",
    "the search for vertical velocity corrugations in a sample of face - on galaxies is now a must follow up program .",
    "the difference with the previous situation is that now we know how and what to search for .",
