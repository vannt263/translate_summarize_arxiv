    "ur purpose here is expository , sparing the reader from most of the mathematical tribulations and , focusing on the more intuitive aspects of the representational results . after a short review of the fundamentals",
    ", the essentials of the mathematical development are given together with some detailed examples to clarify the nuances and satisfy the more mathematically inclined .",
    "in parallel coordinates ( abbr .",
    "@xmath9-coords ) , a point in @xmath10 is represented by a line and a line is represented by a point yielding a fundamental @xmath11 duality .",
    "there follows the representation of @xmath12-flats ( planes of dimension @xmath13 ) in @xmath14 in terms of indexed points @xcite .",
    "naturally , for non - linear objects the representation is more complex , especially if they are also non - convex .",
    "the points of a curve in @xmath10 can be mapped directly into a family of lines whose _ envelope _ defines a curve ( `` line - curve '' ) .",
    "actually this is awkward and also clutters the display .",
    "instead we map the tangents of the original curve into points to obtain the `` point - curve '' , sometimes called `` dual - curve '' , image directly as shown in fig .",
    "[ curve ] . in short",
    ", this approach provides a convenient _ point - to - point _ mapping @xcite .",
    "point - curve mapped into point - curve , result of considering the point - curve as the envelope of it s tangents.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] -0.2 cm    applying these considerations it was proved that the image of an algebraic curve of degree @xmath4 is also algebraic of degree at most @xmath15 in the absence of singular points @xcite . this theorem is a generalization of the known result that conics are mapped into conics @xcite in six different ways .",
    "perhaps we are `` pushing our luck '' , our intent is to apply next the point - to - point mapping in the representation of surfaces considered as the envelope of their tangent planes ; with the resulting image being constructed from the representation of tangent planes @xcite .",
    "as has already been pointed out , planes can be represented in @xmath9-coords by indexed points .",
    "the collection of these planar points , grouped for each index , is the representation of the surface .",
    "-0.3 cm from the images of curves contained in hyper - surface .    in the past @xcite",
    ", surfaces were represented in @xmath9-coords by the envelope of the polygonal lines representing the surfaces points . by itself",
    "this is ambiguous .",
    "for example the image of a sphere in @xmath4-dimensions is the same as the image of the surface obtained by the intersection of @xmath4 cylinders properly aligned having the same radius . in applications",
    "this was ameliorated by accessing the correct equation of the surface when needed .",
    "not only is the ambiguity completely removed with the new representation , but also _ non - convex _ surfaces can be nicely treated something that was not possible previously .",
    "hung @xcite first applied this notion and found that regions representing _ developable _ surfaces consists only of the boundary curves ( i.e. there are no interior points ) , and also that _ ruled _ surfaces can be recognized from characteristic properties of their corresponding regions .",
    "encouraged by these initial results the analysis is extended to more general surfaces yielding useful criteria in the approximation of surfaces by simpler ones ; but we are getting ahead of ourselves .",
    "at first we lay the foundations , then derive the representation of quadratic algebraic surfaces and further generalize to higher dimension as well as more complex hyper - surfaces . as a result an efficient algorithm for constructing the representation of the quadratic surfaces ( given either by _ explicit _ or _ implicit _ equation ) , and a proof that the image of an algebraic surface of degree @xmath7 in @xmath8 is also an algebraic curve and of degree @xmath7 are obtained .",
    "@xmath16n general , the method employed below applies to the class of smooth hyper - surfaces in @xmath8 having a unique tangent hyper - plane at each point .",
    "equivalently , each such hyper - surface is the envelope of it s tangent hyper - planes .",
    "this is our point of departure , for it enables us to represent each tangent hyper - plane in @xmath9-coords by @xmath17 indexed points @xcite .",
    "the hyper - surface s representation consists of the @xmath17 points sets , one for each index @xcite . for the present",
    "we restrict our attention to algebraic hyper - surfaces and in particular those defined by quadratic polynomials . to simplify matters ,",
    "most of the analysis is done in 3-dimensional space but in a way which points to the generalization for @xmath14 .",
    "an @xmath4-dimensional hyper - plane @xmath18 in @xmath14 @xmath19 is represented by the @xmath17 indexed points @xcite . for our purposes",
    "only the first @xmath20 needs to be studied .",
    "the remaining @xmath21 points have similar form differing only in the factor @xmath22 of the @xmath23 .",
    "an important property is that the horizontal distance between the @xmath24-adjacent ( in the indexing ) points is the equal to the coefficient @xmath23 ; from which the sequence of indexed points can be generated from the coefficients or vice - versa .      moving on to the representation of non - linear hyper - surfaces in @xmath14 from their tangent hyper - planes .",
    "let @xmath3 be a smooth @xmath4-dimensional hyper - surface generated by the differentiable function @xmath25 , and an arbitrary point @xmath26 .",
    "then the hyper - surface s tangent hyper - plane at this point is given by : @xmath27 taking the @xmath28 as parameters , the coefficients of the tangent hyper - planes can written as a function of points which satisfy the hyper - surface s equation .",
    "namely , the family of tangent hyper - planes of @xmath3 is represented in homogenous coordinates , by a collection of sets @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ figgenralplane ] ) , containing the indexed points representing each member ( i.e. hyper - plane ) of the family .",
    "each of the @xmath17 indexed set , @xmath29 , consists of the points with the same index .    in the remainder",
    "the analysis is confined to the first indexed set @xmath30 using a shorter notation @xmath31 defined as , @xmath32 where for @xmath30 and the tuple @xmath33 :    @xmath34    in general , the representation in @xmath9-coords is constructed via the rational transformations @xmath35 the representation of all these hyper - planes transform an @xmath4-dimensional hyper - surface into subsets of @xmath36 ; regions which are distinguished from each other by their indices . the algorithm which constructs and describes these regions is presented next .",
    "@xmath0 t first we treat the class of algebraic surfaces in @xmath38 described by quadratic polynomials .",
    "mercifully , the corresponding system of transformations ( [ pqsgen ] ) can be linearized .",
    "the next step is to determine the boundary of the regions representing the surface . without getting into details ,",
    "the existence of the boundary can be assured by selecting an appropriate spacing of axes in the system of the @xmath9-coords , which eventually reflect by changing the constant multipliers of the first equation in ( [ pqsgen ] ) .",
    "let @xmath3 be a quadratic surface whose representation is the region @xmath6 .",
    "the boundary points are those whose every neighborhood contains both interior and exterior points . for this case both the transformation ( [ pqsgen ] ) and the surface , are defined by polynomials and hence are differentiable . the basic properties including continuity are therefore preserved under the transformation .",
    "geometrically we rely on the differentiability in finding those points @xmath39 so that we can `` move '' from @xmath40 in any direction and still remain in region ; these are interior points of @xmath6 .",
    "clearly the boundary points are easily found as the complement of the interior of @xmath6 .",
    "the condition for determining whether a point is interior or not is given by _ theorem of implicit function _",
    "equivalently , a point @xmath41 is interior point if and only if the jacobian , @xmath42 , at this point is different from zero .",
    "conversely , a point @xmath43 for which this is not true is necessarily a boundary point ; namely , a point @xmath44 s.t .",
    "@xmath45 . in essence",
    "the theorem tells us that @xmath6 is closed set and the complement of its interior is the sought after boundary .",
    "generalizing the above for @xmath14 we get the mapping @xmath46 into the projective space , were @xmath47 and @xmath48 . restating the condition in terms of differential products using homogeneous coordinates with the variables",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 yields , @xmath52 this form is more convenient for handling hyper - surfaces embedded in @xmath14 where @xmath53 , for @xmath54 eq .",
    "( [ j(f)homo ] ) can be written equivalently in term of jacobian as , @xmath55 \\psi ^{3}.\\ ] ] substituting @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 in terms of the @xmath56 s yields an equation which defines an algebraic surface , @xmath57 , in @xmath58 .",
    "geometrically , the boundary @xmath59 consist of points which represent tangent planes touching at points of @xmath3 on the intersection @xmath60 .",
    "hence , @xmath59 is the image of the algebraic curve @xmath61 ( see fig .",
    "[ figgenralcurve ] ) .        combining the criterion , eq .",
    "( [ j(f ) ] ) , for the boundary with the equation of the surface ( embedded in 3-dimensional space ) and the transformation equations ( in homogenous coordinates ) yields : @xmath62 solving for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 yields the equation of the boundary . note that if @xmath63 is a polynomial of degree @xmath7 , then the degree of @xmath64 is @xmath65 in terms of all variables , while it is linear in terms of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus far we have constructed a system of four equations ( [ eqsys ] ) in six variables which define a mapping from the @xmath69 into the projective plane @xmath36 .",
    "our aim , is to determine the specific equation of the region s boundary explicitly .",
    "this involves solving this system of equations in terms of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 by eliminating the variables @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the equation s structure turns out to be very advantageous .",
    "since the last three equations are linear , the elimination can be done by isolating a variable ( finding an explicit expression in term of the other variables ) , and substituting in the remaining linear equations .",
