    "the highly controlled manipulation of atomic matter waves has proven to be an exciting field of research in recent years . specially , research in bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , fermi quantum degeneracy , and quantum information processing with ultracold atoms",
    "has achieved tremendous advances @xcite .",
    "future progress in this field will strongly profit from optical addressability , localization , and patterning of atomic systems with a resolution not limited by the wavelength of the radiation involved .",
    "some important examples are site - specific addressing of ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , patterning of becs @xcite , and atom lithography @xcite based on light forces @xcite , optical quenching @xcite , or multi - photon processes @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been several proposals for subwavelength atom localization based on the interaction of three - level atoms with light having a space - dependent amplitude distribution , mainly standing wave ( sw ) fields @xcite . in all these proposals",
    "a spatially modulated dark state is created by means of either electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) or coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite . in fact , a proof - of - principle experiment based on the cpt technique reported intensity patterns in the transmission of a probe field presenting subwavelength spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "significant for the present work , the cpt technique with a sw control field produces atom localization in one of the ground states with a spatial fringe pattern ressembling that of a fabry - perot resonator with cavity finesse given by the ratio @xmath2 between the control and probe field intensities @xcite .",
    "( a ) schematics of the slap technique : a plane matter wave propagates consecutively through a tw and a partially overlapping sw laser field either in space ( as shown here ) or in time .",
    "( b ) three - level atomic system and gaussian temporal profiles of the rabi frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 . @xmath5 and @xmath6 account for the spontaneous emission decay rates of the corresponding transition . ]    in this paper , we propose a state - selective atom localization and patterning scheme based on stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite that , compared to the cpt based techniques , presents several important advantages : ( i ) it produces super - localization , i.e. , narrower localization than that expected from the cpt - finesse parameter @xmath2 ; ( ii ) it is a fully coherent process that does not rely on spontaneous emission to the dark state and , therefore , it can be applied to open three - level systems and to systems where coherence has to be preserved such as becs ; ( iii ) the localized state does not suffer from recoil induced broadening and , therefore , the raman - nath approximation holds @xcite , and , finally , ( iv ) it is robust under uncontrolled variations of the system parameters , e.g. , intensity fluctuations of the laser fields . we describe here the main features of this subwavelength localization via adiabatic passage ( slap ) technique , as well as its potential implementation for matter wave lithography down to the single nanometer scale and for coherent patterning of a bec at the heisenberg limit .",
    "note that stirap without the spatial localization feature introduced here has been proposed @xcite and recently experimentally demonstrated @xcite for the transition from an atomic to a molecular bec and for the optical control of the internal and external angular momenta of an extended bec @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the basics of the slap technique and derive semi - analytical conditions for achieving the super - localization regime . in section iii and iv",
    "we discuss the application of the slap technique for nano - lithography with a ne * atomic beam and for coherent patterning of a two - component @xmath1rb bec , respectively . in section",
    "v we further comment on other possible applications of the slap technique and present a short conclusion .",
    "the schematics of the slap technique are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "a plane matter wave formed by three - level atoms in a @xmath7-type configuration propagates at a velocity @xmath8 through two partially overlapping laser fields : the traveling wave ( tw ) couples the @xmath9 transition with a rabi frequency @xmath10 and the sw couples the @xmath11 transition with a rabi frequency @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the sw field wave number and @xmath14 the characteristic stirap time with @xmath15 the spatial separation between the centers of the two laser beams . @xmath16",
    "( @xmath17 ) is the single - photon detuning between the tw ( sw ) field and the corresponding transition .",
    "@xmath18 ( @xmath6 ) is the spontaneous emission decay rate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( from @xmath19 to @xmath21 ) .",
    "the spatial and the temporal variants of the slap technique are connected by the simple transformation @xmath22 .    under the two - photon resonance condition @xmath23 @xmath24 ,",
    "one of the position - dependent energy eigenstates of the @xmath7-type three - level system is the so - called dark state @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "stirap @xcite consists in following this energy eigenstate from @xmath27 to @xmath28 smoothly changing @xmath29 from @xmath30 to @xmath31 by means of two partially overlapping laser fields as in the counterintuitive sequence of fig .  1 .",
    "to keep the system in the energy eigenstate , this process must be performed fulfilling the global adiabaticity condition @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a dimensionless constant that for optimal gaussian profiles and overlapping times takes values around 10 @xcite .    in the slap technique , we assume that the matter wave has been initially prepared , by means of e.g. , optical pumping , into the internal state @xmath20 . then , those atoms crossing the nodes of the sw remain in state @xmath20 while those interacting with the tw and the sw fields through the stirap process are transferred to state @xmath21 . therefore , an intense sw field should produce sharp peaks on the spatial population distribution of state @xmath20 at its nodes . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) and assuming @xmath34 , the fwhm of these peaks is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 is the fwhm of the peaks in the fabry - perot type localization that would be attained by means of the cpt technique @xcite . therefore , for @xmath38 the super - localization regime which we define by @xmath39 is reached .",
    "note that for @xmath40 corresponding to optimal parameter values @xcite , condition ( 3 ) reads @xmath41 .",
    "population distribution of state @xmath20 after applying ( a ) the slap technique and ( b ) the cpt technique as a function of the amplitude of the tw rabi frequency @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 for the slap case , and @xmath47 for the cpt case .",

    "2 shows numerical simulations of the state selective localization process by integrating the corresponding density matrix equations for both the slap and the cpt techniques . in the cpt technique @xcite ,",
    "subwavelength state - selective localization is obtained by reaching the steady - state through an optical - pumping process to the dark - state involving several cycles of laser excitation and spontaneous emission . in the setup of fig .  1",
    ", the cpt process corresponds to @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where we have assumed , for simplicity , @xmath53 . for @xmath43 and the rest of parameters given in the figure caption , fig .",
    "2(a ) shows that for @xmath54 the super - localization condition ( 3 ) is fulfilled and the slap technique yields better localization than the cpt technique , i.e. , @xmath48 @xmath55 .",
    "note that we have considered here , for simplicity , a 1d sw field in the @xmath20-@xmath21 transition , although the slap techniques applies also to higher dimensions and to any arbitrarely spatially structured field presenting intensity nodes .",
    "as a first implementation , we consider atom lithography based on substrates sensitive to the internal energy of metastable atoms @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , we take a plane matter wave of metastable ne * whose initial internal level @xmath56 has an energy of 16.6  ev and thus high potential for surface damage .",
    "in fact , ne * is a prime candidate for coherent manipulation , since the stirap technique has been successfully reported with ne * @xcite using the @xmath7 scheme @xmath57 where the first and the last are long lived states ( see fig .",
    "however , here we are interested in applying the slap technique such that , away from the nodes of the sw , the initial state is adiabatically transferred to a fast decaying state in order to remove the corresponding high internal energy .",
    "thus we consider the open three - level @xmath7 scheme @xmath58 ( depicted in fig .",
    "3(a ) ) with state @xmath59 decaying to the ground state at a rate of @xmath60 .",
    "3(b ) shows subwavelength atom localization in state @xmath61 ( solid curve ) around a node of the sw ( period of 308.2  nm ) after the application of the slap technique for @xmath62 and the other parameters given in the figure caption . note",
    "that although part of the population ( dashed curve ) is diabatically transferred to the high energy state @xmath63 with lifetime @xmath64 @xcite , this population could be efficiently pumped to the ground state via @xmath65 with an extra laser field .",
    "thus , for realistic parameter values one would expect state selective localization with a fwhm of only a few @xmath66 yielding high contrast peak energies of 80% ( solid curve in fig .",
    "3(c ) ) in the absence of depumping of the @xmath63 state , and of nearly 100% ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "3(c ) ) in the presence of the depumping .",
    "as an important feature of the slap technique , the localized state @xmath67 does not interact with the light fields at any time and therefore does not suffer from recoil induced broadening , which implies that the raman - nath approximation perfectly applies @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the transversal velocity spread of the initial matter wave determines the ultimate resolution limit of the slap technique .",
    "taking @xmath68 as the rms transversal velocity spread , the limit @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "thus , for typical parameters , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , localization down to single nm can be achieved .",
    "as given by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , strong atom localization should also result in the appearance of high momentum components @xcite .",
    "for the results shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we have verified that the highest momentum components do not have time enough to smear out the localized structure until the end of the sw where the substrate is placed .",

    "the scattering lengths are known to be in the proportion @xmath94 with the average of the three being @xmath95 @xcite .",

    "as expected , component @xmath20 develops extremely narrow structures at the nodes of the sw whose width is much smaller than its spatial period . for demonstration ,",
    "we have chosen a large spatial period of 15 @xmath101 m but arbitrary periods down to @xmath110 with a corresponding localization down to the nm scale could be achieved by changing the wave number @xmath111 of the standing wave .",
    "5(c ) shows the time evolution of the fwhm around one node .",
    "the minimal width of the localized structures coincides approximately with the time at which the tw field is switched off , i.e. , at @xmath112 .",
    "we have calculated the transverse momentum spread @xmath113 for this time , obtaining a beam quality factor @xcite @xmath114 which is below the heisenberg limit due to the non - linearities of the two - component trapped bec partially compensating for diffraction .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced the slap technique for state - selective localization and patterning of atomic matter waves .",
    "we have shown that a super - localization regime beating the previously introduced cpt localization technique @xcite can be reached and analytic expressions for the necessary conditions have been derived .",
    "we have discussed the use of the slap technique for nano - lithograhy with a ne * matter wave showing the possibility to imprint high contrast patterns with narrow structures whose fwhm approaches the single nanometer scale .",
    "this lithographic technique is applicable to all atomic systems with a high - energy dark state formed by the combination of a state fast decaying to the ground and a metastable one .",
    "coherent patterning of a two - component @xmath1rb bec in the super - localization regime has been studied in detail as a second example showing that it is possible to overpass the heisenberg limit .    since localization occurs at the nodes of one of the involved laser fields , more evolved patterning schemes",
    "can be realized by extending the present 1d configuration to higher dimensions by applying 2d and 3d sw configurations .",
    "even more complex structures , such as the intensity nodes of higher - order laguerre - gauss modes or the light fields of custom - made micro - optical elements @xcite , could be considered for this technique . following the presented slap technique for coherent patterning of a bec",
    ", one could consider its application to produce a collection of parallel , coherent , and extremely collimated ( pulsed ) atom lasers @xcite or , by observing the corresponding near field diffraction pattern , to investigate the matter wave analogue of the optical talbot effect @xcite .",
    "finally , the slap technique could be also applied to address and detect individual sites in optical lattices by an appropriate choice between the spatial period of the optical lattice and the wavelength of the sw field used in this technique .",
