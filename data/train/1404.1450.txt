    "the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) b - mode polarization by the bicep2 experiment @xcite is truly remarkable as the existence of the tensor mode in the primordial fluctuations provides a direct evidence for inflation in the early universe .",

    "the hli scenario is realized in the supersymmetric seesaw model , which is the simplest extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to include the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the model incorporates the type i @xcite or type iii seesaw mechanism @xcite by which the small nonzero neutrino masses that are evidenced by the neutrino oscillations are naturally explained .",
    "it also includes possibility for generating baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis or the affleck - dine mechanism . as a feature of the model ,",
    "hli directly associates the spectrum of the cmb with the mass scale of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we will see that the new data from the bicep2 experiments constrains this mass scale to be between a few hundred gev and a few tev .",
    "these constraints are potentially useful since the right - handed ( s)neutrinos may also be searched in colliders .",
    "the hli model @xcite is an  all - in \" phenomenological model of inflation that includes the seesaw mechanism @xcite , the origin of the baryon asymmetry , the origin of the dark matter , as well as the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it is based on the seesaw - extended mssm .",
    "the superpotential in the type i seesaw case is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mssm superpotential and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the right - handed neutrino singlet , the lepton doublet , and the up - type higgs doublet superfields , respectively ( the family indices are suppressed ) . in the type iii case , the superpotential is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the right - handed neutrino triplet superfield . with odd r - parity assigned to @xmath8 or @xmath13 ,",
    "the superpotential preserves the r - parity in both cases .",

    "while realistic seesaw requires at least two families of the right - handed neutrinos , we will be interested mainly in the outcome of inflation and consider a simplified one family case .",
    "since the inflationary model is essentially the same for both type i and type iii seesaw , we will describe in the case of the type i model below . estimating the mass scale of the light ( left - handed ) neutrinos as @xmath19 ev@xmath20 where the data of @xcite is used",
    ", the seesaw relation reads @xmath21    inflation is assumed to take place along one of the d - flat directions @xmath9-@xmath10 , which is parametrized by a field @xmath22 so that @xmath23 we consider supergravity embedding with slightly noncanonical khler potential @xmath24 , where @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real parameters .",
    "the third term on the right hand side violates the r - parity ; the consequence of this will be discussed in section [ sec : tev ] .",

    "the dynamics of the resulting system is complicated in general , with a nontrivial inflaton trajectory in multidimensional field space .",
    "it can be shown however that with mild assumptions the model simplifies to give single - field slow roll inflation @xcite .",
    "this is due to the non - zero quartic term in , which makes the @xmath8 field massive , ensuring the inflaton trajectory to lie along the @xmath22 direction .",
    "furthermore , the scalar potential can be shown to be stable along the real axis of the @xmath22 field so that the phase direction of @xmath22 does not participate in the inflationary dynamics .",
    "the model then involves only one real scalar field and the lagrangian becomes @xmath30 where the subscript j stands for the jordan frame and @xmath31 here the field is understood to represent the scalar component . note that @xmath32 of is now written as @xmath33 this is the nonminimally coupled @xmath34 model @xcite .",
    "the higgs inflation model @xcite also has the same structure .",

    "before the universe reaches thermalization , we evaluate the reheating temperature of this model to be @xmath95 the effects of the nonminimal coupling should be negligible , since such effects become important only when @xmath35 is extremely large and the coupling of the inflaton with the particle to which it decays is extremely small @xcite .",
    "the reheating temperature is lower than the grand unification scale .",
    "thus , the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) needs to be produced in a mechanism other than in the gut phase transition .",
    "the supersymmetric seesaw model includes the right - handed ( s)neutrinos and there is possibility that the bau can be produced by the leptogenesis scenario @xcite , in which the lepton number first generated by the out - of - equilibrium decay of the right - handed ( s)neutrinos is later converted into the baryon number via @xmath96-violating sphaleron transitions .",
    "we found in refs @xcite that when the seesaw scale is higher the leptogenesis scenario operates successfully .",
    "let us see how the scenario is altered when the seesaw mass scale is , conforming to the results of the bicep2 experiment .    as the masses of the right - handed ( s)neutrinos are much smaller than the reheating temperature , the right - handed ( s)neutrinos are thermally produced in the reheating process .",
    "the question of whether the thermal leptogenesis operates well or not may be studied in two steps : ( i ) whether sufficient lepton asymmetry is generated by the decay of the ( s)neutrinos , and ( ii ) whether the lepton number is successfully converted into the observed abundance of the baryon number , namely @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the baryon number density and @xmath99 is the entropy density .    in the traditional thermal leptogenesis with hierarchical seesaw masses ,",
    "generation of sufficient lepton asymmetry requires large enough seesaw mass @xmath100 gev @xcite and high enough reheating temperature @xmath101 gev ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these conditions are based on assumptions such as the hierarchy of the seesaw masses and the flavor structure , and may be relaxed . in particular , it is known that when at least two of the right - handed neutrino masses are nearly degenerate , resonance enhancement of the @xmath102-asymmetry parameter takes place , resulting in larger bau for lower reheating temperature ( resonant leptogenesis @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath103 tev in the case of the minimal type i seesaw case ( with two families of @xmath8 ) , we have shown in @xcite that sufficient bau can be produced in the hli model , both for the normal mass hierarchy and for the inverted mass hierarchy . however ,",
    "when @xmath1 is below a few tev , the efficiency of the sphaleron process is strongly suppressed , diminishing the conversion of the lepton number into the baryon number . in the type iii seesaw the lower bound of the seesaw mass for successful leptogenesis is @xcite @xmath104 the lower bound of the type i seesaw mass is in the same order ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    to conclude , the seesaw mass scale , is too small for successful thermal leptogenesis , as the sphaleron process becomes inefficient and the lepton number can not be successfully converted into the baryon number .",
    "the hli model is equipped with supersymmetry and the bau may be generated for example by the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite .",
    "the third term of the khler potential is proportional to @xmath105 , which violates the r - parity . for the small values of the nonminimal coupling @xmath35 ( see table [ table : table1 ] ) , the coefficient of this term is @xmath106 .",
    "along with supersymmetry breaking , this term induces an r - parity violating effective superpotential of the form @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the conformal compensator f - term .",
    "combined with the usual mssm @xmath110-term , the superpotential of the form @xmath111 generates lepton number violating terms @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "these terms are potentially hazardous as they hamper baryogenesis ( which we assume to take place by the affleck - dine mechanism ) .    in generic models of supersymmetry",
    "breaking , the gravitino mass is given by @xmath114 and hence @xmath115 .",
    "the cosmological constraints on the size of the effective yukawa couplings in indicate @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "r - parity violating terms may also generate neutrino masses ( separately from the seesaw mechanism ) and the condition that such effects do not lead to unacceptably large neutrino masses gives somewhat weaker constraint @xmath117 @xcite . using the typical value of the mssm @xmath110 parameter @xmath118 tev",
    ", @xmath119 gives the upper bound of the gravitino mass @xmath120 mev . in practice",
    ", the consequence of the r - parity violation largely depends on the details of assumed scenario of supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "for example , in the `` almost no - scale '' scenario @xcite , we have @xmath121 and consequently the gravitino mass can be much larger than 1 mev .      as the gravitino mass of @xmath122 mev is much smaller than the typical neutralino or slepton masses ,",
    "the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) of the hli model is the gravitinos .",
    "it also can be shown that for the small r - parity violation the gravitinos are sufficiently long - lived , and the mass of @xmath122 mev is large enough for cold dark matter particles .",
    "thus the gravitinos are a good candidate of the dark matter in this inflationary scenario",
    ".    the overproduction constraints of the thermally produced gravitinos give further restriction on the reheating temperature .",
    "the abundance of the gravitinos is @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the running gluino mass and @xmath125 is the hubble parameter measured in 100 km mpc@xmath53 sec@xmath53 . now using @xmath126 mev , @xmath127 tev and @xmath128 ,",
    "the reheating temperature is found to be @xmath129 gev .",
    "this is consistent with the reheating temperature estimated previously in .",
    "finally , let us comment on implication of our inflationary scenario in collider physics .",
    "candidates of the seesaw particles are actively searched e.g. in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "it would be important to discuss detectability of the seesaw particles in the mass range , . in the case of type",
    "i seesaw , production of the singlet neutrinos in colliders is due to mixing with the doublet neutrinos .",
    "however , the smallness of the yukawa coupling corresponding to the tev scale seesaw indicates that the mixing angle is too small , and production in colliders is negligible @xcite . in the type iii seesaw case ,",
    "in contrast , the triplet fermions are produced by the electroweak gauge interactions , and production in lhc is in principle possible .",
    "indeed , the type iii seesaw particles of mass scale below 245 gev have already been excluded at 95% cl by the atlas experiment @xcite ( cms gives similar lower bound 180 - 210 gev @xcite ) .",
    "the coverage of the lhc at 14 tev run is expected to be up to 750 gev @xcite .",
    "this means that in fig.[fig : nsr_bicep2 ] significant part of the parameter space inside the 68% contour will be covered .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether the type iii hli model survives this test .",
    "we have discussed in this paper implications of the bicep2 results in the higgs - lepton inflation ( hli ) model .",
    "the large nonzero value of the tensor mode @xmath0 calls for significant change of its interpretation .",
    "we have found that the hli model can be fit with the new cmb data , it stays consistent with the neutrino oscillation data , and the thermally produced gravitinos remain a viable candidate of the cold dark matter .",
    "the bau , nevertheless , can not be generated by the leptogenesis scenario ; due to the smallness of the seesaw mass scale , the sphaleron process becomes inefficient and the lepton asymmetry generated along with the right - handed ( s)neutrinos can not be converted into baryon asymmetry .",
    "we discussed that the affleck - dine mechanism is a possible scenario of baryogenesis .",
    "we also pointed out that in the type iii seesaw case , the triplet fermions in the mass range conforming to the bicep2 experiment can be searched in the lhc at 14 tev run .",
    "one of the original motivations for the hli model @xcite was to overcome the shortcomings of the higgs inflation model @xcite which predicts small tensor mode fluctuations at the cost of introducing extremely large nonminimal curvature coupling @xmath130 . due to the discovery of the large tensor mode fluctuations of inflationary origin by the bicep2 experiment , the higgs inflation model lost its attractiveness and the good - old @xmath34 and @xmath61 minimally coupled chaotic inflation models have resurfaced as favored models .",
    "the hli model with small seesaw mass scale which we discussed in the present paper is in fact an _ almost _ minimally coupled @xmath34 model .",
    "let us point out however that the hli model has at least two advantages over the @xmath34 chaotic inflation model .",
    "one is that it is a concrete particle physics realization of inflation with predictive power in particle phenomenology .",
    "the other advantage is that the extremely small inflaton self coupling @xmath131 is not unnatural in hli , since @xmath132 and @xmath133 which is , while small , in the same order as the electron yukawa coupling .    in view of the bicep2 results ,",
    "the @xmath61 chaotic inflation model driven by the right - handed scalar neutrinos @xcite is an attractive model , sharing many aspects with the one presented in this paper .",
    "both inflationary models are realized in the supersymmetric seesaw model .",
    "they arise as different choices of khler potential and inflaton trajectory . in their model @xcite",
    ", leptogenesis is always successful and the seesaw scale is necessarily large , @xmath134 gev .",
    "seesaw particles of such large masses are , unlike in our model here , obviously far beyond the reach of any collider experiments",
