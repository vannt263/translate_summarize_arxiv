    "another important point to note is that pressure is the same for the two cross - sections , i.e. it does not depend on @xmath116 being nearly constant across the gap , as in the lubrication theory .",
    "abrupt changes of the pressure in the transverse direction can be seen in fig .",

    "in contrast to oscillations of a transverse velocity , the local maxima and minima of pressure are located at the boundary between perfect - slip and no - slip stripes .",

    "our simulation results do confirm qualitatively these theoretical predictions , but of course a quantitative agreement can not be obtained since we measure pressure at some finite distance from the wall , and also because in simulations pressure is always finite .       +    finally , we consider the lateral force on the sphere , which could be present in addition to the normal drag force . in most real experiments the alignment of the sphere and stripes is inconvenient or difficult ,",

    "[ fig_lateralforce ] ( a ) .",
    "two configurations , 1 and 3 , where the apex of the sphere is located above the center of a no - slip or a perfect slip stripe , are symmetric .",
    "therefore , the lateral force is expected to be absent .",
    "since the asymmetry is maximized in two other configurations , 2 and 4 , where the sphere is above the border between stripes , we consider them with the goal to maximize the lateral force .",

    "these results also clearly show the importance of a location of a sphere relative to stripes in generating the lateral force .",
    "they illustrate that the lateral force vanishes in positions 1 and 3 , is positive for position 2 , and negative for position 4 .",
    "this indicates that in the asymmetric position the lateral force pushes the sphere towards the center of the perfect - slip stripes , where the friction is lower .",
    "we remark that recently pimponi et al . studied numerically the particle motion in the vicinity of the striped wall and reported similar behavior of a lateral force of small magnitude  @xcite .    the detailed comparison between the simulation results obtained with a different fraction of the gas / liquid area is then shown in fig .
