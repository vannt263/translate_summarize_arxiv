    "methods of probabilistic latent analysis arise from the aspect model @xcite , which in turn belongs to the family of statistical mixture models @xcite .",
    "such methods provide a solid statistical foundation , as involving the likelihood principle as well as a proper generative model of the data .",
    "this implies in particular that standard techniques from statistics can be applied for questions like model fitting , model combination , and complexity control .",
    "first applications of these methods were made on semantic indexing of text corpus , with the probabilistic latent semantic indexing framework @xcite developed upon the latent semantic analysis .",
    "the factor representation obtained by this method allows to deal with polysemous words and to explicitly distinguish between different meanings and different types of word usage . within this framework , probabilistic latent component analysis ( plca )",
    "has then been developed as a general method for feature extraction from non - negative data , with pioneer applications to audio @xcite and image @xcite .",
    "following studies in audio research have in particular dealt with the tasks of multi - pitch estimation @xcite , sound source separation @xcite , instrument identification @xcite , melody extraction @xcite , temporal music structure @xcite and speech processing @xcite .",
    "aspect model @xcite is a latent variable model for general co - occurrence data which associates an unobserved class variable @xmath2 with each observation , i.e. with each occurrence of an acoustic event @xmath3 belonging to a different group of events @xmath4 .",
    "the generative model associated with this formalism is defined as follows    * select an event group @xmath5 with probability @xmath6 , * pick a latent class @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 , * generate an acoustic event @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 .",
    "the mathematical expression of this process takes the form of a a joint probability model , where one has to sum over the possible choices of @xmath7 which could have generated the observed pair @xmath11 , i.e.    @xmath12    such a generative process follows two independence assumptions",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "observation pairs @xmath11 are assumed to be generated independently ; 2 .",
    "the conditional independence assumption is made that conditioned on the latent class @xmath7 , acoustic events @xmath9 are generated independently of the specific event group @xmath5 .    for speech modeling with the plsi method @xcite , the acoustic event @xmath9 corresponds to words and the group of events @xmath5 corresponds to documents . for music modeling with the plca method @xcite , the acoustic event e corresponds to frequencies and the group of events @xmath5 corresponds to time frames .",
    "the classical data available for fitting plca model is an empirical distribution @xmath13 over the bi - dimensional space of events and groups .",
    "this distribution can be produced directly from observed data , which can be a corpus of words gathered in different documents as in the plsi method @xcite , a spectrogram of a musical excerpt as used in most audio applications of the plca method @xcite , or any various frequency table .",
    "fitting a plca model on such data consists in choosing @xmath6 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 such as @xmath16 `` approximates '' @xmath13 in a sense that is seldom ( or never ) specified in plca literature .",
    "the usual step is then to explain that this ( undefined ) problem can be solved using an em - like algorithm , based on the original algorithm developed by @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we will : 1 ) define formally the optimization problem we are trying to solve ; 2 ) explain why and how the em - algorithm applies to this problem .",
    "stating that our plca model should be such as @xmath16 `` approximates '' @xmath13 is clearly not sufficient to define our optimization problem . since we try to approximate distribution @xmath13 with @xmath16 , a `` natural '' approach consisting in minimizing a distribution distance between both distributions . in this context ,",
    "a very popular choice is to use the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite ( this divergence is also called the relative entropy ) between @xmath13 and @xmath16 :    @xmath17    which we would like to minimize .    by using bayes formula and the fact that @xmath13 does not depend on plca parameters , we immediately obtain that @xmath18 , and that @xmath10 and @xmath8 should be chosen such as minimizing the following objective function : @xmath19      let s define @xmath20 a @xmath21-sample drawn from @xmath13 , the law of large numbers gives : @xmath22 hence , our optimization problem can be interpreted as maximizing the log - likelihood of the latent class model @xmath23 using an infinite sample drawn from @xmath13 .      with a finite sample of size @xmath21 , maximizing the lefthand likelihood in eq .",
    "[ eq : likelihood ] can be achieved iteratively by a direct application of the original em algorithm @xcite .",
    "since @xmath24 are latent variables in our model , the e - step of the algorithm consists in computing the following expected conditional likelihood : @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the values of plca parameters from the previous iteration : @xmath27    if @xmath21 tends to infinity , @xmath28 tends to @xmath29 the m - step of the algorithm consists now in maximizing @xmath30 . for that purpose",
    ", we just need to find the zero of the gradient , i.e. @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath31 @xmath33 , we want : @xmath34 by combining these equations with the stochastic constraints @xmath35 we get immediately : @xmath36",
    "in this short paper , we have provided the necessary mathematical background to understand what problem is usually solved when fitting plca models to observed data , and how and why it is connected to the em algorithm . if this innovation is in itself intellectually satisfying , one could claim that it provides nothing really useful since the resulting formulas are unchanged by this approach .",
    "however , this framework better justifies recent extensions of plca models towards hidden markov models in order to develop joint modeling of spectral structures and temporal dynamics @xcite . by connecting plca estimation explicitly to the standard em algorithm , the clarified theoretical background to use extension of the em algorithm such as generalized em with newton - raphson steps @xcite .",
    "for example , this might allow to introduce multinomial or poisson distributed components in plca models .",
