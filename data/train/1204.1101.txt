    "because of its tunable band gap , which can be changed through an external gate voltage , bilayer graphene is a promising material with a great potential for application to new electronic devices.@xcite in the low - carrier - doping regime of bilayer graphene , electrons are strongly coupled via coulomb interactions . the phase of bilayer graphene in this low carrier concentration , and at low temperature , is still not completely understood .",
    "several candidates have been suggested for the ground state , such as a ferroelectric - layer asymmetric state,@xcite a layer - polarized antiferromagnetic state,@xcite a quantum anomalous hall state,@xcite a quantum spin hall state,@xcite a quantum valley hall state,@xcite a charge density wave state,@xcite and the possibility of gapless states , such as the nematic state.@xcite the experimental observations on the ground state of bilayer graphene , all performed on high quality suspended samples , are also controversial .",
    "some experimental results showed that the system is gapped at the neutrality point,@xcite whereas one experiment found a gapless state.@xcite so far , most of the theoretical studies are based on the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation ( schfa),@xcite many - body perturbation theory,@xcite and the renormalization group approach.@xcite all the above approaches have been applied to the simplified two-@xcite and four - band@xcite continuum models .",
    "it is well known that the schfa usually overestimates the order parameter characterizing a broken symmetry phase and the transition temperature because it neglects the fluctuations of the effective one - body interaction field and of other one - body observables such as the charge density .",
    "since the understanding of the electronic state of bilayer graphene at low carrier doping and low temperature is a fundamental issue for graphene physics , it is necessary to investigate the state with a more sophisticated approach that takes into account the effect of charge density fluctuations on top of the mean - field ground state .    in this work ,",
    "we study the existence of a gapped broken inversion symmetry phase ( gbisp ) using both the schfa and the renormalized ring - diagram approximation ( rrda).@xcite the rrda takes into account the charge density fluctuation ( cdf ) effect beyond the mean field and satisfies the microscopic conservation laws.@xcite for an electron system with long - range coulomb interactions , cdf is the predominant contribution to the self - energy of electrons .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the rrda results for the ground - state energy of two- and three - dimensional interacting electron gases are more accurate than the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) results when compared with monte carlo simulations .    in the rrda ,",
    "the green s function and self - energy are self - consistently determined by coupled integral equations .",
    "the self - consistent calculation of the self - energy in momentum space involves carrying out many convolutions , which are numerically expensive . in order to reduce the computational time required by our approach , we convert the convolutions in momentum space to multiplications in real space . since the continuum model is the low - energy limiting case of the lattice model , the momentum of the electrons is confined within two valleys around the dirac points.@xcite because of the finite momentum cutoff for each valley , the conversion of the convolution from momentum space to real space is no longer valid for the two- and four - band continuum models . instead of modeling bilayer graphene with an effective continuum model ,",
    "we therefore sketch it as a bilayer of a hexagonal lattice model .",
    "the lattice model does not require a momentum - space cutoff , and is therefore immune to the aforementioned problems of the continuum models .",
    "the key problem in calculating the self - energy is to manage to deal with the long - range coulomb interaction between electrons accurately .",
    "for the two - dimensional system under consideration , this interaction is inversely proportional to the momentum transfer @xmath0 in the long - wavelength limit . in a continuum model",
    ", one can transform the @xmath1 singularity to the logarithmic one after performing the azimuthal integration@xcite and then get rid of the logarithmic singularity by special treatment . in a lattice model , however , we can not perform the azimuthal integration analytically and must face the @xmath1 singularity . since dealing with the long - range coulomb interaction is inevitable in many - body problems , we now present a numerical algorithm to tackle the interaction divergence issues systematically .",
