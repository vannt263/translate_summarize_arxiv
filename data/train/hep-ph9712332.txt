    "-0.1 cm    a quark - gluon plasma is a new state of matter in which quarks and gluons are deconfined .",
    "this is in distinct contrast to quarks and gluons in hadron matter where the quarks and gluons of a hadron are confined within the hadron which has a radial dimension of about a fermi .",
    "deconfinement does not mean that quarks and gluons can be isolated and individually detected .",
    "it only means that quarks and gluons are allowed to move nearly freely to a greater region of space outside the radial domain that is usually associated with a hadron .",
    "they are nevertheless still confined within the region of strongly interacting matter . for the quark - gluon plasma which may be produced by high - energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the transverse dimension of the plasma is about the size of the overlapping region of nuclear matter and quarks and gluons can move nearly freely within the distance of a few fermi , typical of the length of the radii of the colliding nuclei .",
    "a quark - gluon plasma is expected to be the state of lowest energy for strongly interacting matter at high temperatures or high baryon densities .",
    "lattice gauge calculations @xcite show that there is a phase transition between the hadron phase and the quark - gluon plasma phase at a temperature @xmath3 at which the energy density @xmath4 is about @xmath5 @xcite . for a pure gauge theory without fermions ,",
    "the critical temperature was found to be @xmath6 mev @xcite . with quarks ,",
    "the critical temperature is considerably lower .",
    "if one takes 200 mev to be the order of the critical temperature @xmath3 , the critical energy density @xmath4 of the quark - gluon plasma will be of the order of 4 gev/@xmath2 .    in the lattice gauge theory ,",
    "the gauge field is described in terms of the link variable which is the analogue of the spin variable in ferromagnetism .",
    "we can understand qualitatively that the confined state of strongly interacting matter at low temperatures arises from the correlations of the link variables at different spatial locations at short distances , as well as large distances , so as to minimize the total energy , resulting in a linear - confining potential between a quark and an antiquark . at low temperatures ,",
    "the tendency to maintain the correlations between the link variables at different spatial locations due to the interactions overwhelms the disruptive tendency due to quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "as the temperature increases , the tendency to disrupt the correlation due to thermal motion overwhelms the tendency to correlate due to the interactions , and quarks and gluons become deconfined .    theoretical work on matter with a high baryon density has not reached the same degree of sophistication as in the baryon - free case because of the difficulty of treating dynamical fermions @xcite .",
    "one expects qualitatively that as the baryon density increases thedensity of quarks and antiquarks increases , and the pressure due to degenerate fermions -0.0",
    "cm = -17 = -3.2 in will increase .",
    "as the baryon density increases above a critical density , the pressure from the degenerate fermions can overwhelm the bag pressure of confinement , and there can be a phase transition from the state of confined quark matter to a state of deconfined quark - gluon plasma even at zero temperature .",
    "the expected phase diagram of strongly interacting matter is shown schematically as in fig .",

    "-0.1 cm    why do we use high - energy heavy - ion collisions to search for the quark - gluon plasma ? to appreciate this possibility , it is useful to take note of the amount of energy that is involved in these collisions .",
    "we can consider the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) which is being constructed at brookhaven national laboratory and will be operational in 1999 .",
    "the collider is designed to accelerate nuclei to an energy of about 100 gev per nucleon . in the collision of a gold nucleus with another gold nucleus in such a collider , the energy carried by each nucleus is about 100@xmath7197 gev , or 19.7 tev , and the center - of - mass energy @xmath8 is about 2@xmath719.7 tev , or 39.4 tev .",
    "the magnitude of energy involved in nucleus - nucleus collisions is very large indeed . to attain even greater center - of - mass energies",
    ", there will be a program to accelerate heavy ions to a center - of - mass energy of about 3 tev per nucleon in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) being planned at cern .",
    "this will lead to a center - of - mass energy of about 1262 tev for the collision of pb on pb @xcite .",
    "the experimental results in the last two decades indicate that nucleon - nucleon as well as nucleus - nucleus collisions are highly inelastic .",
    "consider first a nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "in such a collision , about half of the longitudinal kinetic energy of the nucleons is lost .",
    "the energy lost is deposited in the vicinity of the center - of - mass carried away by the quanta of the fields , which are mostly pions with a small fraction of kaons and baryon pairs . in a nucleus - nucleus collision , many nucleon - nucleon collisions take place and these collisions deposit the energies of the nucleons in the center - of - mass regions . in high - energy collisions , because of lorentz contraction , all the nucleon - nucleon collisions take place at about the same time in close spatial proximity in the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass system . as a result",
    ", a region of very high energy density , as high as a few gev per cubic fermi , will be produced .",
    "such an energy density is within the same order as that expected to be the critical energy density leading to the transition from the hadron matter to the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the temperature of the matter in the central region near the center - of - mass is also high .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to look for the quark - gluon plasma using high - energy heavy - ion collisions . -1",
    "-0.1 cm    in a high - energy heavy - ion collision , one starts with a cold nuclear matter in collision . as a result of the collision",
    ", a quark - gluon plasma may be formed .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma can only be a transient state of matter , as the matter will cool down and will return to the hadron phase at the end .",
    "it is during the excursion into the quark - gluon plasma phase that it will leave the signals of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "there are generally two different methods .",
    "the first one is to study the reaction products of the constituents of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "for example , one can use @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and look at the momentum distribution of the product gamma particles to infer the momentum distribution of the gluons and quarks in the plasma @xcite .",
    "one can also use the dilepton spectrum in the reactions of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in order to infer the momentum distributions of the gluons and quarks in the plasma @xcite .    in the second method",
    ", one makes use of the peculiar properties of the plasma to infer the existence of the plasma .",
    "one can study the suppression of @xmath0 production @xcite , the enhancement of strangeness production @xcite , the dependence of the energy density as a function of the temperature @xcite , the restoration of chiral symmetry@xcite , or the large effective lifetime of the system @xcite .    in using any of the above signals to study the quark - gluon plasma , there needs to be a careful subtraction of signals from other sources .",
    "such a subtraction is not without ambiguities and uncertainties .",
    "thus , a clear identification of the quark - gluon plasma will require not just a single piece of data but rather many collaborative pieces of evidence pointing to peculiarities associated with the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "@xmath0 is a bound state consisting of a @xmath15 quark and a @xmath16 quark . in free space ,",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 interact through a linear confining potential and a color - coulomb interaction . in high - energy heavy ion collisions ,",
    "@xmath0 may be produced in one of the many nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "if a quark - gluon plasma is formed in the meantime and this @xmath0 finds itself in the environment of the quark - gluon plasma , then two things will happen .",
    "first , the linear confining potential between the charm quark and the charm antiquark will not be present because the temperature of the quark - gluon plasma brings the @xmath0 particle to the state of deconfinement .",
    "second , the color - coulomb interaction between the charm quark and the charm antiquark will be modified because the light quarks , antiquarks , and gluons of the plasma can move around from other locations to screen the charm quark color charge from the charm antiquark .",
    "this reduces the color charge seen by the charm quark with respect to the charm antiquark .",
    "the color - coulomb interaction is modified into a color - yukawa interaction , with the range of the yukawa depending inversely on the temperature .",
    "such an inverse dependence arises because the greater the temperature , the greater the quark density surrounding the charm quark , and the greater is the degree of screening to diminish the interaction between the charm quark and the charm antiquark .",
    "as the range of the color - yukawa interaction decreases , the energy levels of the @xmath17 system rise .",
    "in other words , the energy level of the @xmath17 system rises with temperature .",
    "when the temperature rises to a critical temperature , there can be a resonance of @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath18 @xcite . as the temperature rises even higher",
    ", then there will be no bound state between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and no matter how close the @xmath15 is brought to @xmath16 , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 will drift apart .",
    "when the phase of the quark - gluon plasma has passed , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 will find themselves so far apart that the formation of a bound state is no longer possible , and the charm quark will pick up a light antiquark , while the charm antiquark will pick up a light quark , to form @xmath19 and @xmath20 states .",
    "they will not be part of the bound state formation process .",
    "they are lost from bound state production , and thus in the presence of the quark - gluon plasma , the production of @xmath0 is suppressed @xcite .    -0.3",
    "-0.1 cm    one can select the decay product of @xmath0 to be dileptons and look for dileptons which carry the signature of @xmath0 . as leptons interact only electromagnetically with hadron matter and the interaction is not strong , the leptons are not affected by the final - state interaction due to the presence of the strongly interacting matter .",
    "thus , one advantage of @xmath0 as a signal of the quark - gluon plasma is that the detection of @xmath0 through dilepton coincidence is less subject to final - state interactions .",
    "the dileptons carry information on the system at the moment of their creation .",
    "furthermore , the calibration of the dilepton cross sections can be made reliably by comparing with dilepton production through the drell - yan process , which arises from the collision of the quark parton of one nucleon with the antiquark parton from the other nucleon and is quantitatively very well understood .",
    "the disadvantage of @xmath0 is that @xmath0 is also suppressed by non - quark - gluon plasma sources , and these must be taken into account to get information on the suppression by the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "in addition , the production and absorption mechanism for @xmath0 with low transverse momenta at a few hundred gev is not completely understood . much theoretical and experimental work is needed to construct a picture of @xmath0 production and absorption .",
    "-0.3 cm    -1.6 cm",

    "only those with low invariant masses will evolve into precursors of @xmath0 and @xmath32 .",
    "because @xmath0 are produced predominantly at rapidity zero , the precursor is produced as essentially at rest in the center - of - mass system , and the fate of the precursor can be studied best in the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass frame .",
    "the precursor will encounter projectile and target nucleons at high relative energies .",
    "the absorption by collisions with these nucleons constitutes the hard component of absorption which is present in both @xmath1 and ( nucleus @xmath37)-(nucleus @xmath38 ) collisions .",
    "it has been suggested recently that the produced precursor exists as a coherent admixture of color and angular momentum states @xcite .",
    "the total cross section for this coherent precursor for a collision with a nucleon at high energy can be evaluated by the two - gluon model of the pomeron @xcite .",
    "the total cross section is approximately the weighted sum of the color - singlet and color - octet total cross sections .",
    "as the color - singlet cross section is very small , and the color - octet cross section is very large ( of the order of 30 to 60 mb ) , the absorption cross section depends on the color - octet fraction .",
    "the experimental absorption cross section suggests a color - octet fraction of the order of 20% .",
    "different parton combinations will lead to different color admixtures and different absorption cross sections .",
    "in a situation where the precursor comes predominantly from a single combination of partons , as in the present case when @xmath39 fusion is the dominant process for @xmath17 quarkonium production at fixed target energies , the precursor state @xmath40 is absorbed in its passage through nuclear matter by a single precursor - nucleon cross section @xmath41 . the survival probability for the precursor after traveling a path length @xmath29 in nuclear matter is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number density of nucleons in a nucleus at rest . because the production of different bound states comes from the projection of the coherent precursor state onto the bound states after the absorption , the production of various @xmath17 bound states in the nuclear medium are suppressed by the same rate with the same @xmath41 .",
    "thus , in @xmath1 collisions where the precursors are absorbed only by collisions with nucleons , we expect that the survival factors for the production of various @xmath17 bound states are characterized by approximately the same absorption cross section @xmath41 .    the approximate equality of the absorption cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath32 production in @xmath1 collisions is indeed observed @xcite , as one can see from the approximate equality of the slope of the @xmath1 lines for @xmath0 and @xmath32 in figs .",

    "this is further collaborated by another piece of data in figs .",
    "3@xmath22 and 3@xmath23 where we plot respectively the ratio @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "the collision of the precursor with the soft particle at low energies brings up a different type of interaction between them .",

    "it is operative in @xmath1 and @xmath55 collisions .",
    "the absorption by soft particles occurs at low relative energies , and constitutes the soft component of absorption .",
    "it occurs mainly in @xmath55 collisions .",
    "the signature for the hard component is an approximately straight line in the semi - log plot of the survival probability for @xmath1 collisions as a function of the path length or @xmath120 .",
    "the slope of the line gives the precursor - nucleon absorption cross section .",
    "the signature for the soft component consists of a gap and a change of the slope from the @xmath1 line to the @xmath55 line in the semi - log plot of the survival probability as a function of the path length or @xmath28 . the greater the gap , the greater the change of the slope , and vice versa",
    ". application of these signatures to examine the @xmath0 and @xmath32 data indicates that the degree of absorption by soft particles on @xmath0 production , as revealed by the o - cu , o - u , and s - u data , is small .",
    "the absorption by soft particles on @xmath32 production is , however , quite large .",
    "a microscopic absorption model which takes care of all precursor sources and absorbers is used to examine these two mechanisms .",
    "the microscopic model results support the above qualitative descriptions .",
    "when one extends one s consideration to pb - pb collisions , one finds that the degree of @xmath0 absorption by soft particles as constrained by the data of o - cu , o - u , and s - u collisions can not explain the pb - pb data , and a new phase of strong @xmath0 absorption in pb - pb collisions is suggested .",
    "the anomalous suppression of @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions can be explained as due to the occurrence of a new phase of strong @xmath0 absorption , which sets in when the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions at a spatial point exceeds about 4 and corresponds to a local energy density of about 3.4 gev/@xmath2 .    in order to demonstrate that the anomalous suppression in pb - pb collisions arises from the occurrence of the quark - gluon plasma , it is necessary to obtain additional pieces of collaborative experimental evidence .",
    "much future work remains to be done to identify the quark - gluon plasma if it is ever produced in high - energy pb - pb collisions ."
