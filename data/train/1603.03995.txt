    "the above disjoint path structure connecting two nodes is generalized into some tree structures connecting more than two nodes , see @xcite . to show the properties of these generalizations clearly , we hope to state from the connectivity in graph theory .",
    "we divide our introduction into the following four subsections to state the motivations and our results of this paper .",
    "all graphs considered in this paper are undirected , finite and simple .",

    "we denote by @xmath8 the subgraph obtained by deleting from @xmath3 the vertices of @xmath9 together with the edges incident with them .",
    "connectivity is one of the most basic concepts in graph theory , both in combinatorial sense and in algorithmic sense . as we know , the classical connectivity has two equivalent definitions .",

    "we call this definition the ` cut ' version definition of connectivity . a well - known theorem of whitney @xcite provides an equivalent definition of connectivity , which can be called the ` path ' version definition of connectivity . for any two distinct vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath3 , the _ local connectivity",

    "two graphs with the same connectivity may have different degrees of vulnerability in the sense that the deletion of a vertex cut - set of minimum cardinality from one graph may produce a graph with considerably more components than in the case of the other graph .",
    "for example , the star @xmath20 and the path @xmath21 are both trees of order @xmath22 and therefore connectivity @xmath23 , but the deletion of a cut - vertex from @xmath20 produces a graph with @xmath24 components while the deletion of a cut - vertex from @xmath25 produces only two components .",
