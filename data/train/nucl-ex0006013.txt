    "in a study of the radioactive decay of various actinide fractions @xcite separated from a cern w target which had been irradiated with 24-gev protons @xcite , very unusual phenomena which could not be understood from nuclear systematics , had been observed .",
    "first @xcite , isomeric states with t@xmath4 @xmath5 0.6 y and @xmath6 30 d ( 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath7 times longer than the expected half - lives of the corresponding ground states ) were found in neutron - deficient @xmath8am and @xmath8bk nuclei , respectively . about 3x10@xmath7 atoms of @xmath8am and 4x10@xmath2 atoms of @xmath8bk",
    "were produced in the isomeric states , and decayed by the @xmath9 or electron capture processes .",
    "the character of these states was not clear : they are far from closed shells where high spin isomers are usually found , and they have very long lifetimes as compared to the known shape isomers .",
    "secondly , long - lived fission activities with half - lives of several years @xcite , have been seen in all the actinide sources from am up to fm , and perhaps also in the md - no and the no - lr sources . also here",
    "the origin of such long - lived fission activities is not known .",
    "another observation was very low energy , 3.0 and 4.0 mev , particle groups , which were seen in the am source in coincidence with l@xmath10 x - rays in the am region @xcite .",
    "the estimated lifetimes @xcite deviate by about 23 and 12 orders of magnitude respectively from those obtained from the systematic relationship between @xmath0-particle energies and their lifetimes @xcite .",
    "it therefore was assumed @xcite that the observed particle groups were protons of unknown origin rather than @xmath0-particles .",
    "perhaps the most surprising phenomenon was the relatively low energy and very enhanced @xmath0-particle groups , observed in various actinide sources which were separated from the w target @xcite .",
    "for instance , a 5.14 mev group with a half - life of about 4 y has been seen in the bk source , and a 5.53 mev group with a half - life of about 26 d , has been seen in the lr - no source .",
    "one is faced here with the following problems :    \\a ) the long lifetimes of the nuclei as compared to corresponding ground state systematics : it is expected and in fact evident from the identification of the @xmath8bk and @xmath8am nuclei , that neutron - deficient actinide nuclei can be produced via the secondary reactions in the w target .",
    "lifetimes of several years for neutron - deficient nuclei around bk , and of about a month in the lr - no region , are very much longer than the expected minutes or hours in the first case , and seconds in the second case . here",
    "also one is led to the conclusion that long - lived isomeric states of unknown character , which decay by the observed @xmath0-activities , were produced in the reaction .",
    "\\b ) the problem of the * low * energy of the @xmath0-particles : an energy of 5.14 mev in the neutron - deficient bk region is a * low * energy as compared to typically 6 - 7 mev , and 5.53 mev is * very low * for lr - no nuclei , where the typical transition energies are above 8 mev .",
    "the penetrability factor for 6 mev @xmath0-particles in the bk region is about 5 orders of magnitude larger than for 5.14 mev , and for 8 mev in the no region is about 13 orders of magnitude larger than for 5.53 mev @xcite .",
    "naturally , one assumes that an @xmath0-decay from an isomeric state is of even higher energy than normal , because of the larger available transition energy .",
    "one is therefore faced with the problem , what is causing the nucleus to decay with very low - energy @xmath0-particles , when in principle much higher transition energy is available with correspondingly many orders of magnitude larger penetrability factor .",
    "\\c ) the problem of the very enhanced character @xcite of the @xmath0-decay : according to systematics @xcite , the half - lives for 5.14 mev @xmath0-particles for bk and nearby nuclei , and for 5.53 mev @xmath0-particles in lr - no , are around 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath11 y. the question is how the @xmath0-particle decay rate can be * enhanced * by 5 to 7 orders of magnitude .",
    "\\d ) the problem of the large cross section of the heavy - ion reaction : the production yield in the secondary reaction experiment depends on two cross sections : i ) the cross section for production of suitable fragments with high enough kinetic energies , which may interact with other w nuclei in the target , and lead to the formation of the various actinide nuclei .",
    "ii ) the heavy ion reaction , or the evaporation residue , cross section , which depends first on the fusion cross section between such a fragment and another w nucleus in the target , and secondly on the competition with the fission process during the cooling of the produced compound nucleus . using reasonable estimates about the first process , evaporation residue cross sections in the region of mb",
    "are needed in order to explain the production of about 10@xmath2 actinide atoms seen experimentally .",
    "these are unexpectedly large cross sections , particularly when the production of nuclei in the lr - no region is considered where the typical evaporation residue cross sections are below 1 @xmath12b @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite some similar abnormal decay phenomena have been observed , for the first time , in several ordinary heavy - ion reaction studies . in a study of the @xmath13o + @xmath14au reaction at e@xmath15 = 80 mev @xcite , an isomeric state has been found in @xmath16fr which decays by emitting a relatively low energy @xmath0-particle group , with e@xmath17 = 5.20 mev and t@xmath4 @xmath5 90 m. since this half - life is longer than the known half - life of the ground state of @xmath16fr ( t@xmath4 = 3.18 m ) , it was concluded that a long - lived isomeric state had been formed in this nucleus .",
    "a t@xmath4 of 90 m for 5.20 mev @xmath0-particles in @xmath16fr is enhanced by a factor of 3x10@xmath7 as compared to normal transitions @xcite .",
    "however , this @xmath0-group was observed in coincidence with @xmath18-rays which fit predictions for a superdeformed band @xcite .",
    "therefore the effect of large deformations of the nucleus on the @xmath0-particle decay was calculated and found @xcite to be consistent with the observed enhancement .",
    "it was argued @xcite that since the isomeric state decays to a high spin state , it should also have high spin , and since it decays by enhanced @xmath0-particle emission to state(s ) in the second well of the potential , it should be in the second well itself .    in the same reaction",
    "two long - lived proton activities with half - lives of about 6 h and 70 h were found @xcite with proton energies of 1.5  4.8 mev with a sharp line at 2.19 mev . a possible interpretation in terms of production of long - lived isomeric states in the second well of the potential of the parent nucleus which decay by protons to the normal states of the daughter",
    "was given @xcite .",
    "very recently @xcite , long - lived isomeric states , produced by the @xmath19si + @xmath20ta reaction at bombarding energies of 125 and 135 mev , which decay by strongly hindered @xmath0-particle and proton activities , have been discovered .",
    "in particular , a very retarded 8.6 mev @xmath0-particle group with 40 d @xmath21 t@xmath4 @xmath21 2.1 y ( as compared to less than a 1 @xmath12s , typical for a normal transition of such high energy ) was found in coincidence with @xmath18-rays of a superdeformed band .",
    "this group has been consistently interpreted @xcite in terms of production of a long - lived isomeric state in the third ( hyperdeformed ) well probably of @xmath22hg , which decays by very retarded @xmath0-particles , to the second ( superdeformed ) well in @xmath23pt .    in the present work",
    "it is shown that the low energy and very enhanced @xmath0-particle groups , seen in the heavy actinide , bk , es and lr - no sources , can be consistently interpreted as due to formation of long - lived isomeric states in the second and third wells of the potential energy surfaces in the parent nuclei , which decay to the corresponding wells in the daughters .",
    "furthermore , it is pointed out that according to theoretical predictions @xcite , the third minima are the actual ground states of the very heavy actinide nuclei .",
    "the experimental procedure has been published before @xcite and will be briefly reviewed .",
    "actinide fractions from am up to lr - no were separated @xcite from our ( w3 ) @xcite tungsten target ( 6 cm long , 30 g , 99.95% pure ) which was irradiated in cern with about 1x10@xmath24 ( @xmath25 protons of 24 gev energy .",
    "1 shows a block diagram of the chemical procedure . the main aim in the chemical separation was to separate the heavy actinides , from am up to lr , from the rare - earth isotopes and from @xmath0-emitting nuclei such as po , ra , ac , th , u and pu . several anion",
    "( dowex-1 ) and cation ( dowex-50 ) exchange columns were used for this purpose , and at the end two fractions were obtained . the first included the remainder of the rare - earth elements , am and part of the cm .",
    "the second fraction included the other part of cm and all the heavier actinides .",
    "these two fractions were then passed through dowex-50 cation exchange columns with ammonium @xmath0-hydroxyisobutyrate acid at 87@xmath26 c , in order to separate individual actinides .",
    "the elution curves obtained from these last separations are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the x - rays of the rare - earth elements , measured with a si(li ) detector were used throughout the whole procedure to identify the contents of the fractions .",
    "actinide sources were prepared as indicated in fig .",
    "2 using the measured elution positions of the rare - earth elements , and known information on the actinides @xcite .",
    "the sources were prepared on thin glass discs which were then heated to about 600@xmath26 c to remove any organic material present .",
    "the decontamination factor for th and pu was estimated to be @xmath6 10@xmath27 @xcite ; the decontamination factor from a typical rare earth element like gd , determined by a comparison of the residue number of @xmath28gd nuclei seen in the bk and cf sources @xcite with the total number of produced @xmath28gd nuclei , deduced from its known production cross section @xcite , was about 9x10@xmath2 .",
    "the intensity of @xmath28gd was found to be about 4000 times larger in the cf and bk sources ( where it should preferentially be ) compared to the adjacent es and cm sources @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-particle spectra were measured from the various sources using 450 mm@xmath29 si surface barrier detectors . in the present paper we concentrate on the 5.14 , 5.27 and 5.53 mev groups which have been seen with the bk , es and lr - no sources , respectively .",

    "in general the discovery of such isomeric states with their very unusual decay properties , the very much reduced extra - push energy needed for their production in interactions between very heavy ions , and the possibility that the third minimum is actually the true ground state of very heavy and perhaps superheavy nuclei , provide completely new considerations in the study of heavy and superheavy elements .",
