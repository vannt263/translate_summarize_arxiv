    "_ josephson junction _ ( jj ) is considered as the work horse in superconducting electronics .",
    "they are based on two weakly coupled superconducting electrodes via a constriction , e.g. , made up by a normal metal or a tunnel barrier and are routinely applied in ultra - high sensitive squid ( superconducting quantum interference devices ) magnetometers , or the voltage standard @xcite .",
    "especially @xmath4 tunnel junctions attract considerable interest as the fabrication of high density @xmath3-based josephson circuits with promising small parameters spreads is possible . with the advent of high - quality magnetic tunnel junctions one",
    "decade ago , new so far unexplored devices are now under development which combine both fabrication techniques by advanced multilayers of superconducting ( s ) , insulating ( i ) and magnetic ( f ) materials .",

    "the first considerations @xcite of non - uniform @xmath7 s were caused by technological drawbacks leading to a variation of the effective barrier thickness by either fabrication @xcite or illumination of light - sensitive barriers @xcite .",
    "jjs with periodic spatially modulations of @xmath7 were intensively studied regarding the pinning of fluxons @xcite , the spectrum of electromagnetic waves @xcite or their magnetic field dependencies @xcite .",

    "+ the properties of jjs depend on geometrical ( width , length , thickness ) and the physical ( dielectric constant @xmath9 , specific resistance @xmath10 , magnetic thickness @xmath11 and @xmath7 ) parameters . when tailoring @xmath7 all other parameters should be unchanged to facilitate calculations and avoid further inhomogeneities in the system .",
    "these conventional methods for changing @xmath7 necessarily modify either @xmath9 or @xmath10 .    in this paper",

    "magnetic field transport measurements on stepped junctions have a good correlation with the simple analytical model .    as an outlook , the use of a non - magnetic stepped layer avoids the modifications of magnetic cross - section by intrinsic magnetic remanence , and may help to further improve the consistence of @xmath27 measurement with simulation . replacing the optical lithography with electron beam lithography may enhance the lateral accuracy of the step down to the dimension of e - beam resist .",

    "+ the patterning process could be adjusted to all thin film multilayer structure providing that the reactive etching rates of the layer materials differ , e.g. , it can be applied to other metallic multilayer systems such as magneto - resistance devices ( gmr / tmr elements ) where a local variation of magnetic properties may enhance their functionality .",
