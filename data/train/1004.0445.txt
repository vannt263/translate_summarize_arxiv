    "the critical phenomena in @xmath0he near the superfluid transition have been studied with exceedingly high precision of the temperature @xmath8 ( @xmath9 deg ) @xcite .",
    "such experiments have thus been used to confirm or predict universal relations near the critical point . moreover , in this system , a number of unique nonequilibrium situations can be found in the nonlinear response regime . in particular , the superfluid transition is very sensitive to applied heat flow @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 is above the transition temperature @xmath11 at one end of the cell and below @xmath12 at the other end , a hei - heii interface emerges separating superfluid and normal fluid regions @xcite . here",
    "@xmath8 is nearly constant in the superfluid and has a finite gradient in the normal fluid , so the temperature gradient is almost discontinuous across the interface . in experiments , it emerges when @xmath0he in a normal fluid is cooled from a boundary below @xmath12 or when @xmath0he in a superfluid is warmed from a boundary above @xmath12 .",
    "this interface has a thickness proportional to @xmath13 at small @xmath3 and is thus a unique singular object .",
    "some authors were also interesred in the heat capacity in heat flow near the superfluid transition @xcite .",
    "another interesting case is to quench liquid @xmath0he from its normal to its superfluid phase by a mechanical expansion @xcite . in such phase ordering with a multi - component order parameter , topological singularities ( vortices in @xmath0he ) should be proliferated in an early stage after quenching @xcite .",
    "the superfluid transition can also be greatly influenced by gravity due to the pressure dependence of @xmath1 . in @xmath0he near the transition , the specific heat exhibits a sizable logarithmic singularity , but the isothermal compressibility has almost no singularity @xcite , resulting in nearly homogeneous density profiles for not large cell length on earth .",
    "thus the height - dependence of @xmath1 is the main origin of inhomogeneity in equilibrium @xmath0he , preventing precise measurements of the critical phenomena in @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath14 axis is taken in the upward direction on earth , @xmath1 decreases with the height @xmath14 as t_(p)= t _ ( 1 + gz ) , where @xmath15 is the transition temperature at the cell bottom and @xmath16@xmath17 at saturated vapor pressure with @xmath18 being the gravity constant .",
    "the origin of the @xmath14 axis is at the cell bottom .",
    "we introduce the local reduced temperature as /t_(p)-1 = ( t / t_-1 ) - g z , which depends on @xmath14 and represents the distance from the lambda line in the @xmath19-@xmath8 phase diagram therefore , equilibrium states are noticeably inhomogeneous in the temperature region || gh , where @xmath20 is the vertical cell length .",
    "remarkably , in the temperature range @xmath21 at homogeneous @xmath8 ( in equilibrium ) , a gravity - induced two - phase coexistence is possible with an upper region in a superfluid and a lower region in a normal fluid @xcite .",
    "the thickness @xmath22 and the characteristic reduced temperature @xmath23 of the gravity - induced interface is determined by the balance @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the correlation length with @xmath26 .",
    "hence they are given by _",
    "g= _ + 0(_+0g)^-2/5 , _",
    "g = ( _ + 0g)^3/5 , which are about @xmath27 and @xmath28 cm on earth , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that application of an electric field @xmath29 or a magnetic field @xmath30 gives rise to a shift of @xmath12 by an amount proportional to @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "if such a field is inhomogeneous , it leads to a gradient of @xmath12 , as well as the earth gravity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both gravity @xmath18 and heat flux @xmath3 can be crucial near the lambda line .",
    "hereafter @xmath3 will be measured in units of erg@xmath6@xmath7s .",
    "if heated from below , they both serve to decrease @xmath33 with increasing the height and the interface changes over from the gravity - induced one to the heat - induced one at @xmath34 with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "( we may determine this crossover @xmath3 by equating the thicknesses of these interfaces . ) on the other hand , if heated from above , they can compete to produce new nonequilibrium states .",
    "in fact , moeur _",
    "et al._@xcite realized self - organized superfluid in @xmath0he heated from above , where the temperature gradient and the gradient of @xmath35 were balanced as t_= - t_g=0 , yielding a homogeneous @xmath36 with _",
    "sos(q ) 1.010 ^ -8q^0.813 in the range @xmath37 .",
    "this self - organized region extended over a macroscopic region in a 7.4 mm tall , 2 cm diameter cylindrical cell .",
    "it is surprising that the distance @xmath33 to the lambda line was held fixed at an extremely small negative constant over a macroscopic region .",
    "et al._@xcite pointed out that @xmath0he in heat flow is an example of self - organized criticality .",
    "however , @xmath0he in heat flow and gravity stays slightly away from the lambda line , so it is not in a  critical state  , to be precise .",
    "notice that the balance relation ( 5 ) itself follows from the vortex resistance in the gorter - mellink form @xcite , /dz",
    "= t b(t ) q^3 , where @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 near the transition @xcite .",
    "the balance @xmath41 then yields @xmath42 with _",
    "sos^v = ( b_0 q^3/g)^1/ 1.310 ^ -10q^1.35 . however , this @xmath43 is smaller than the experimental @xmath44 in eq.(6 ) by one or two orders of magnitude for @xmath45 . in previous simulations in one dimension @xcite , another kind of singular objects , phase slips , came into play , producing a thermal resistance in accord with the experiment . in the literature ,",
    "phase slips were theoretically studied in one dimension @xcite and have been observed in quasi - one - dimensional superconductors @xcite and in @xmath0he in narrow apertures @xcite .",
    "the self - organized superfluid states are analogous to the resistive states in wire superconductors in electric field ; however , in our case , phase slips appear as sheets even for macroscopic cell width .",
    "this is because the uniaxial effect of gravity is intensified near the lambda line .",
    "similar self - organization should well be realized in @xmath0he in the presence of a gradient of electric or magnetic field , for example , around the tip of a charged needle kept cooler than the surrounding liquid @xmath0he .",
    "originally , the balance relation ( 5 ) was predicted for normal liquid @xmath0he @xcite .",

    "the temperature gradient is @xmath49 so that /dz= ( q / t__0 ) ^x _ -g if @xmath50 , the balance in eq.(4 ) gives @xmath51 with _",
    "son(q ) = ( t__0 g / q)^1/x _ = 3.810 ^ -9q^-2.22 .",
    "this holds in the region @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the relaxation length .",
    "weichman and miller @xcite argued that the balance relation ( 5 ) is attained only when the correlation length @xmath25 is shorter than @xmath54 . from eq.(4 ) this local equilibrium condition is rewritten as @xmath55 .",
    "thus we obtain the upper bound @xmath56 needed for the self - organization above the lambda line . for larger @xmath3 ,",
    "the system crosses across the lambda line and a hei - heii interface appears . in accord with these results ,",
    "et al._@xcite observed self - organized normal fluid states for @xmath57 . analyzing the nonlinear diffusive equation ( 10 ) ,",
    "weichman and miller @xcite also predicted a new thermal wave propagating only upward in self - organized normal states .",
    "this wave was observed both above and below the lambda line@xcite .",
    "the physical processes in the self - organized superfluid remain quite unclear , since in the experiments near the transition measured was only the temperature and the simulations were one - dimensional .",
    "realistic three - dimensional simulations are needed to investigate how vortices and phase slips come into play . with this purpose",
