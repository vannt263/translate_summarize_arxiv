    "progress in high - energy physics relies on accelerator designers contemplating charged particle beams of ever higher energies and intensities .",
    "as schemes for accelerating charged particles become more complex and ambitious in their aims , it is apparent that some existing theoretical models are inadequate for a proper understanding of new challenges . in many existing models",
    ", matter is represented using classical point particles and it is not clear how to unambiguously and consistently model their electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the nub of the problem is precisely how one should sensibly formulate the interaction of a classical point charge with its _ own electromagnetic field_. the charge density of a point particle is singular and must therefore be handled carefully .",
    "assumptions must be made about how the singular coulombic stresses are compensated by non - electromagnetic stresses when calculating the particle s self - force .",
    "this issue was addressed by dirac  @xcite nearly 70 years ago and led to the covariant lorentz - dirac equation for the trajectory of a point charge in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "however , unlike more familiar equations of particle mechanics , the lorentz - dirac equation is a _",
    "third - order _ ordinary differential equation in proper time for the particle s trajectory and has a number of unusual properties including self - acceleration and pre - acceleration .",
    "unless special final conditions are adopted , it predicts that an isolated and free point charge with non - zero initial velocity will accelerate forever and if the particle is subjected to a sharp electromagnetic pulse it will begin to move before the pulse reaches it .",
    "methods for evading such unpalatable conclusions involve iterating the lorentz - dirac equation in powers of its charge @xmath0 .",
    "landau and lifshitz  @xcite showed that truncating the resulting series to any _ finite _ order leads to a second - order evolution equation yielding particle trajectories with more reasonable properties .",
    "although their argument yields a workable scheme , it is not at all clear that it may be generalised to a collection of accelerating high - energy charged particles in close proximity .",
    "neglecting higher - order terms in @xmath0 may be suspect when the particle number density is sufficiently high . in conclusion",
    ", a number of ad - hoc choices must be made to obtain a sensible relativistic equation of motion for a collection of charged point particles starting from first principles .",
    "for a recent account of the issues concerning the derivation of the lorentz - dirac equation see  @xcite .",
    "many of the above issues are due to the uneasy marriage of field and point particle concepts in classical electrodynamics .",
    "classical point particles are a convenient idealisation and one might argue that quantum theory must be invoked to yield a palatable answer .",
    "however , the testy relationship between fields and point particles resurfaces in quantum electrodynamics where divergences in `` bare '' quantities must be regulated prior to renormalisation to obtain physical results . given the above complexities and reservations , an alternative approach has recently been developed  @xcite to analyse the ultra - relativistic dynamics of a collection of accelerating charged particles .",
    "the attitude adopted in  @xcite and the present article is that models of matter based on classical relativistic field theory are more suitable for high - energy beam dynamics than those employing classical point particle notions .",
    "the model in  @xcite employs a smooth relativistic field description of the electromagnetic _ and _ matter content where the total energy and momentum of the electromagnetic and matter fields are conserved .",
    "charged matter is modelled as a @xmath1-vector field on spacetime whose trajectories describe the bulk particle motion .",
    "the partial differential equations governing the electromagnetic and matter fields in this article are fully coupled and non - linear .",
    "although exact solutions describing highly symmetric configurations can be found , the system of equations is in general only tractable when subjected to an approximation scheme .",
    "such a scheme , based on a covariant asymptotic expansion in a running parameter @xmath2 around the light - cone , was introduced in  @xcite and permits calculation of the detailed dynamics of ultra - relativistic charged particle beams in external electromagnetic fields . in principle",
    ", one can calculate the field quantities to any desired finite order in @xmath3 .",
    "the present article focuses on some of the issues encountered when analysing the model in  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the non - linearities in the field equations may lead to solutions whose charge density diverges despite being initially regular .",
    "sections  [ section : cold_fluid_model ] and  [ section : development_of_singularities_in_rho ] briefly review the charged continuum model in  @xcite and show that diverging solutions exist satisfying a substantial range of initial conditions .",
    "this behaviour is commonplace in many continuum models in physics , such as in neutral gas dynamics and fluid dynamics , and is often ameliorated by including dissipative processes .",
    "section  [ section : discussion_of_crossing_trajectories ] argues that dissipative processes will not prevent the formation of multiple currents in charged beams .",
    "sections  [ section : lagrangian_cold_charge ] and  [ section : multi_component_charge ] develop and analyse a continuum model accommodating currents with a dynamical number of components and section  [ section : ultra - relativistic_approximation ] extends the ultra - relativistic analysis methods introduced in  @xcite to multi - component charged currents .",
    "the model discussed in this section and in  @xcite describes a collection of accelerating charged particles , with ( rest ) mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath0 , as a dynamical continuum .",
    "the vector field @xmath5 is the @xmath1-velocity of the continuum on spacetime and its integral curves describe the bulk motion of the collection of charged particles .",

    "setting @xmath29 to @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath25 yields the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 components of the equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 the levi - civita connection on @xmath30 and @xmath38 the interior ( contraction ) operator on forms .",
    "the term @xmath39 in ( [ np_maxwell_v_lorentz ] ) is a continuum generalisation of the covariant expression for the lorentz force on a point charge ( the charge to mass ratio @xmath40 has been absorbed into the definitions of @xmath41 and @xmath12 ) where the tangent to the point charge s proper - time parametrised worldline has been replaced by @xmath5 .",
    "the charged matter drives the electromagnetic field through ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_star_f ] ) and the electromagnetic field acts back on the matter through ( [ np_maxwell_v_lorentz ] ) conserving total energy and momentum .",

    "in  @xcite highly symmetric exact solutions to ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_f]-[np_maxwell_v_v_dot_v ] )  describing `` walls of charge '' were used to motivate a hierarchy of field equations for modelling ultra - relativistic charged particle beams .",

    "therefore , the continuum undergoes local hyperbolic motion and it is straightforward to solve to ( [ wall - of - charge_de]-[wall - of - charge_vv ] ) in a comoving coordinate system @xmath54 adapted to @xmath5 , as shown in  @xcite , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the initial hypersurface @xmath57 . for charge distributions initially at rest",

    "this result agrees with the non - singular behaviour of the exact solutions to ( [ wall - of - charge_de]-[wall - of - charge_vv ] ) satisfying @xmath175 presented in  @xcite ; for @xmath135 to be positive @xmath176 must be non - zero .",
    "the integral curves of @xmath5 for the particular solution to equations ( [ wall - of - charge_de]-[wall - of - charge_vv ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath177 are shown in figure  [ figure : tz_crossings ] .",
    "trajectories on which @xmath148 and @xmath149 are solid and trajectories on which @xmath144 are dashed .",
    "thus , according to ( [ rho_diverges_over_finite_deltalambda ] ) , @xmath41 diverges at points along the solid trajectories , which meet at about @xmath178 .",

    "any comoving coordinate system @xmath54 adapted to the trajectories , where @xmath60 is constant on each trajectory , degenerates where the solid trajectories cross .",
    "the determinant of the jacobian of the @xmath182 transformation vanishes at such points and @xmath41 diverges .",
    "in fluid and gas dynamics , crossing trajectories are considered to be a symptom of incomplete physics .",
    "all real fluids and gases are viscous to some extent and trajectories may cross if their viscosity is neglected .",
    "for example , a compression wave in a hypothetical inviscid fluid may lead to a velocity field with crossing characteristics , i.e. the velocity becomes multi - valued . in reality",
    "this is not what happens ; the velocity remains single - valued and stabilises to form a propagating shock .",
    "the fluid on either side of the shock is essentially inviscid but close to the shock the second - order spatial derivatives of the velocity are so large that dissipation can no longer be neglected .",
    "however , it is far from clear that such arguments are relevant for a charged particle beam , which is physically very different from a normal fluid .",
    "although ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_f]-[np_maxwell_v_v_dot_v ] )  are often said to describe a `` cold charged fluid ''  @xcite , this terminology is misleading .",
    "microscopically , a normal fluid is a complicated system of neutral particles whose interactions are dominated by molecular collisions and possibly gravity but the dominant inter - particle forces in a beam of electrons are entirely electromagnetic in origin . at first sight",
    ", it seems that all of the necessary physics is contained in ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_f]-[np_maxwell_v_v_dot_v ] ) .",
    "the velocity field @xmath5 is a smoothed out representation of the particle motion .",
    "the fact that the trajectories cross does not mean that the particles are colliding ; it merely indicates that a smooth field representation of the particles has degenerated .",
    "similarly , the @xmath26-volume number density of a collection of particles may attain arbitrarily large values if the particles dynamically arrange themselves into planar or linear configurations .",
    "nevertheless , the electric field induced by @xmath5 in ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_f]-[np_maxwell_v_v_dot_v ] )  is inconsistent where trajectories of @xmath5 cross .",
    "equation ( [ equation_for_e_along_v ] ) indicates that the electric field in any wall - of - charge solution is constant along @xmath5 .",
    "however , during the crossing the charge distribution `` passes through itself '' and the electric field has to change .",
    "the reason for this is easiest to appreciate by the following simple analogy .",
    "consider the dynamics of a pair of positive _ sheet _ charges that are permitted to pass through each other .",
    "the sheets are arranged so that their normals and their electric fields lie along the @xmath179-axis .",
    "each sheet has the same properties ; its self - induced electric field is @xmath183 at all points to its right and @xmath184 at all points its left , where @xmath185 is constant , and its charge per unit area is @xmath186 .",
    "the sheets are labelled @xmath21 and @xmath11 and sheet @xmath21 lies to the left of sheet @xmath11 initially .",
    "the electrostatic force acting on each sheet is constant and is due to the electric field of the other sheet .",
    "the force per unit area acting on sheet @xmath21 is @xmath187 and on sheet @xmath11 is @xmath188 .",
    "thus , the sheets will repel each other but their electric forces will not be enough to stop them meeting for sufficiently large opposing initial velocities .",
    "let the initial velocities be so large that the sheets pass through each other . at all times",
    "before they meet , the force on sheet @xmath21 is @xmath187 and the force on sheet @xmath11 is @xmath188 .",
    "after they meet their rles have been exchanged ; sheet @xmath11 is acted on by @xmath187 while sheet @xmath21 is acted on by @xmath188 . now consider a large number of sheets undergoing collective motions in which only _ some _ of the sheets pass through each other .",
    "a continuum realisation of this model is a dynamical set of component continua each with its own velocity field .",
    "the number of components evolves in time and depends on the history of the total continuum .",
    "the spacetime fields @xmath189 satisfying ( [ np_maxwell_v_d_f]-[np_maxwell_v_v_dot_v ] )  offer an eulerian description of a single component continuum .",
    "although a dynamical number of components can be simulated using more complicated eulerian field theories  @xcite , such approaches are restrictive because an upper bound must be placed on the number of anticipated components . in the following section a new lagrangian model of a multi - component charged continuum",
    "is proposed in which the number of components is dynamical and free to attain _ any _ value .",
