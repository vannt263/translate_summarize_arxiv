    "the star formation history of the universe is closely linked with the evolution of the gas content of the universe .",
    "observations of the distribution and total gas content in galaxies and in intergalactic clouds offer some of the most important observational constraints for the cosmology and galaxy evolution models . because stars form out of cold , dense gas clouds , the history of galaxy formation and evolution is also the history of gas accretion and conversion into stars . here",
    "we derive the total cold gas density for the local volume by deriving the local co luminosity function and combining with the existing estimates of the neutral atomic gas density .    a variety of luminosity functions ( lfs ) and mass functions are found in the literature : optical ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , hi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while several groups have investigated the local neutral hydrogen density , little information is available on the molecular gas content in galaxies because of the lack of appropriate data . in her pioneer work",
    ", @xcite derived averaged values of co luminosity and the co / hi flux ratio based on a maximum likelihood probability distribution for 40 galaxies and 47 upper limits obtained by combining all available data at the time . since the large fraction of the co measurements used were non - detections ( upper limits ) , the derivation of the co luminosity function was highly problematic .",
    "nevertheless , a general trend of increasing number of co emitting galaxies per unit volume with decreasing co luminosity was suggested by this analysis .",
    "nearly 15 years later , the availability of the extragalactic co data has improved greatly .",
    "the fcrao ( five college radio astronomy observatory ) extragalactic co survey @xcite represents a particularly rich database for the investigation of co luminosity function and molecular gas content in galaxies .",
    "we have constructed a large , statistically significant sample of far - infrared ( fir ) and optical @xmath0-band selected galaxies from this survey and derived a non - parametric co luminosity function .",
    "our sample galaxies range over 4 orders of magnitudes in co luminosity , and only a small fraction are non - detections .",
    "since co is a tracer of hydrogen molecules , molecular hydrogen mass can be derived from co luminosity . by integrating the resulting molecular gas mass function , we then derive the molecular gas mass density and the total cold gas mass density of the local universe .",
    "the fcrao extragalactic co survey ( `` the survey '' , herein ) is the largest co survey of galaxies available in the literature , containing observations of 300 galaxies at 1421 positions @xcite . since the survey covers a broad range of hubble types and contains a large number of detections ( 236 or 79% ) , it is well suited for a statistical analysis and for constructing a co luminosity function",
    ". the majority of the survey galaxies were selected from the second reference catalog ( rc2 ; * ? ? ? * ) or the iras database .",
    "most of the galaxies in the survey are spiral or irregular galaxies at declination north of @xmath7 and satisfy at least one of the following three criteria : @xmath8 , @xmath9 jy , or @xmath10 jy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description ) .",
    "the majority of the detected galaxies in the survey were observed at multiple positions along the major axis , and the total co fluxes were derived by modeling the underlying co distribution .",
    "the survey is not complete in terms of any of the sample selection criteria , and the full sample can not be used directly for a statistical analysis in a straightforward way .",
    "the analysis of the velocity integrated co luminosity is further complicated by the fact that the co line width varies from one galaxy to another ( and even one position to another in a given galaxy ) while the sensitivity achieved also varies depending on the observing condition even if identical integration times are used ( typically 2 - 4 hours ) .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to address the sensitivity and completeness limit of the survey in terms of the observed co flux .",
    "instead , taking advantage of the well - known tight correlation between the fir and co luminosity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we utilize the iras 60 @xmath11 m flux density of the individual sample galaxies to define a complete sample for a statistical analysis and the derivation of the co lf .",
    "we further test the robustness of the technique and the selection bias by deriving the co luminosity function using the optical @xmath0-band selection ( see   [ sec : coblf ] ) .",
    "previously @xcite successfully derived the hi mass function for the field galaxies using the optical selection , and the radio luminosity function has been successfully derived using the fir selection function by @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the well defined and well studied iras bright galaxy samples ( bgss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt the sample selection criterion of 60 @xmath11 m flux density limit greater than 5.24 jy .",
    "a total of 200 galaxies in the survey satisfy this criteria .",
    "most of the selected galaxies are spirals of types sa - sc while 14 galaxies are mergers , 7 galaxies are close pairs , and 3 galaxies have no type determined . in most cases",
    "we adopt the 60 @xmath11 m fluxes from the bgs surveys . for galaxies with angular diameters larger than 8",
    ", we adopt the values from @xcite after multiplying by 1.18 in order to match the flux scaling ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this rescaling has little impact on our sample completeness limit because most of our sample galaxies have flux densities much larger than 5.24 jy .",
    "some of the 60 @xmath11 m flux density measurements come from @xcite , and 10 galaxies satisfying our selection criterion are added to the sample .",
    "five of these galaxies are not in the bgs survey area , and two are present in @xcite but not in the bgs surveys .",
    "there are 12 galaxies in in our selected sample that are brighter than 5.24 jy at 60 @xmath11 m and were not detected in co ( see table  [ tab : missing_galaxies ] ) .",
    "the co ( 10 ) flux measurements for five of these galaxies are found in the literature .",
    "the remaining 7 galaxies are treated as two limiting cases : ( a ) as detections with zero flux ; and ( b ) as detections at the upper limit flux value ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a large number of non - detections would severely limit the determination of the the true co lf , but the non - detections account for less than 4% in our sample and thus have little overall impact .",
    "some of the galaxy distances come from direct measurements such as using cepheids .",
    "we adopt a hubble constant of @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 for the remaining galaxies .",
    "since we are using the co database obtained from largely a single instrument ( 2.5% of the sample taken from other surveys ) , the internal consistency of the data and the analysis should be quite good .",
    "our sample also includes 26 galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "we adopt a uniform distance of 16 mpc for the virgo galaxies .",
    "we have constructed a co lf with and without virgo galaxies in order to see if the presence of the cluster galaxies influenced the shape of the co lf ( see   3 ) .    to examine the uniformity and completeness of our sample",
    ", we have analyzed the differential number count statistics as a function of the @xmath14 flux density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : s60counts ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath14 sources are uniformly distributed in a euclidean space and are not evolving , the resulting differential number count should be a power - law distribution with @xmath15 .",
    "the number of sample galaxies per bin shown in figure  [ fig : s60counts ] is consistent with such a power - law , but the slope is somewhat shallower . when all of the flux density bins are included , the best fit power - law index is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 . for the @xmath14 flux density between 10 and 100 jy where most of the sample galaxies fall ,",
    "the differential number counts are more consistent with the uniform distribution within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "there are several factors contributing to the flatter than expected power - law slope in the observed number counts in figure  [ fig : s60counts ] .",
    "first of all , the spatial distribution of galaxies is in general _ not _ uniform , particularly given the relatively high flux density cutoff we adopted .",
    "the situation is exacerbated by the fact that our galaxy is located within a galaxy aggregate called the local supercluster .",
    "the flattening of the galaxy counts among the high flux density bins as seen in figure  [ fig : s60counts ] is an immediate outcome of the local large scale structures .",
    "@xcite noted a similar number count enhancement in their analysis of the first bright galaxy sample ( bgs1 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath18 for our sample is about 0.35 , indicating that on average our sample galaxies are about 10% closer than the uniform case .",
    "the @xmath18 values are particularly low for the log @xmath19 bins of 9.6 - 10.4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vvm ] ) , and similar trend is also seen in the @xmath18 plot by @xcite .",
    "comparison to @xcite value @xmath20 is suggesting that major cause of this discrepancy is weak bias in our sample towards galaxies closer than average expected from the complete sample , while the large scale structure plays less important role .",
    "although the fcrao co survey selected target galaxies `` at random '' from the parent sample of iras and @xmath0-band selected galaxies , a slight bias favoring galaxies which were well suited to the fcrao resolution ( 1@xmath21 - 5@xmath21 in size ) is also present .",
    "such a bias manifests non - trivially in these statistics , however .",
    "given the limitation of our sample , such as selecting galaxies suitable for observation with fcrao telescope and the local large scale structures , the steep power - law index of @xmath22 shown in figure  [ fig : s60counts ] suggests that our assumption of random and uniform sampling from the parent samples still seems reasonable .",
    "effects of these potential biases on the derivation of the lfs are evaluated by the derivation of the 60@xmath23 lf using the same sample , as discussed bellow .",
    "a luminosity function represents the space density of the sample galaxies per luminosity bin ( @xmath24 ) centered on l. it represents the probability density of finding a galaxy with a specific luminosity , and it also contains information on the total luminosity in the sampled volume .",
    "we use the classical @xmath25 method @xcite to derive the lf and associated uncertainty directly as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is number of objects per volume per luminosity bin centered on luminosity l , @xmath28 is the sample volume appropriate for each of the galaxies , and n is the number of galaxies in the bin .",
    "the fcrao extragalactic co survey covers the same area as the iras bgs @xcite , and we selected a subset using the same iras 60 @xmath11 m flux density cutoff .",
    "therefore , the sampling correction for our sample can be reduced to a simple scaling relation if our sample is a fair subset of the bgs , as argued above (   [ sec : sample ] ) . in this case , the scaling factor is the ratio of the number of galaxies contained in bgs surveys and number of galaxies in our sample .",
    "the sample volume obtained using this approach is : @xmath29 where d is maximum distance at which galaxy of given luminosity could be detected for a given flux limit , and @xmath30 is the total solid angle covered by both bgs1 @xcite and bgs2 @xcite in _",
    "sterradian_. @xmath31 is the ratio of the number of galaxies in our sample and the number of galaxies in both bgs samples .",
    "bgs1 and bgs2 together contain 601 galaxies and cover 83% of the sky .",
    "the 60 @xmath11 m luminosity represents the contribution from the iras 60 @xmath11 m band to the fir luminosity @xcite and was calculated using the following relation from @xcite : @xmath32 where d is the distance in mpc and @xmath33 is the iras 60 @xmath11 m band flux density in jy .    as a way to verify our co sample correction and to evaluate the effects of various sample biases discussed in ",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we first derive the 60 @xmath11 m lf for our co - selected galaxies in order to compare it to the previously published 60 @xmath11 m lf by @xcite .",
    "as shown on figure  [ fig:60lf ] , the agreement between the two 60 @xmath11 m luminosity functions is excellent .",
    "yun et al .",
    "sample was selected with 2.5 times smaller flux density cutoff than the bgs and is thus 9 times larger in size .",
    "while this is not a complete verification of our derivation method , this agreement lends support to our assumption that our sample is a fair subset of the complete 60@xmath23 selected sample . the normalization factor",
    "could in principle be dependent on the 60@xmath23 luminosity .",
    "the comparison of the 60@xmath23 lfs suggests that this dependence is weak if any .",
    "about 13% of our sample are virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "again , the 60 @xmath11 m luminosity function was constructed including and excluding virgo galaxies .",
    "the resulting luminosity functions are very similar  see figure  [ fig : coirlf ] .",
    "the similarity would arise if the cluster galaxies are distributed in luminosity bins in the same manner as the field galaxies and if the virgo galaxies contribute only a small fraction to each luminosity bin .",
    "previous studies of virgo galaxies have suggested that their molecular gas contents are affected little by their cluster environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since we are interested in the total cold gas density of the local volume regardless of the galaxy environment , we include all virgo galaxies in our analysis here on .      encouraged by the success of deriving the 60 @xmath11 m lf above for the 200 galaxies in our sample , the co luminosity function",
    "is derived using the @xmath34co(10 ) flux with the same sample and volume correction .",
    "the co luminosity is calculated as @xmath35 , where d is the distance to the galaxy in mpc and @xmath36 , following the same notation as @xcite . ]",
    "is the velocity integrated co flux in jy km s@xmath13 .",
    "the computed co luminosity for our sample galaxies ranges between @xmath37 and @xmath38 jy km",
    "s@xmath13 mpc@xmath39 .",
    "they are divided into 10 bins of unit magnitude ( 0.4 wide in a log scale ) .",
    "there are larger uncertainties at the low luminosity end because only a small number of sources occupy these bins .",
    "the resulting co luminosity function is shown in figure  [ fig : coirlf ] .",
    "it is well described by a schechter function which has an exponential cutoff at high luminosity end .",
    "the low luminosity end power - law slope is quite flat , similar to the 60 @xmath11 m lf ( see   [ sec : discussion ] ) . to quantify these properties ,",
    "the characteristic parameters are derived for the schechter function @xcite of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the normalization factor , @xmath42 is the low luminosity end power - law slope , and @xmath43 is the characteristic luminosity at which the exponential cutoff develops .",
    "since we are using logarithmic intervals to construct lf , we need to change this equation to an appropriate form : @xmath44 in this case @xmath45 , and it is calculated using eq .",
    "(  [ eq:1/vm ] ) .",
    "the derived best fit schechter parameters are : @xmath46 mpc@xmath4 mag@xmath13 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 jy km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath39 ( @xmath49 using the standard co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor  see   [ sec : gasdensity ] ) .",
    "the single schechter function fit using all 10 luminosity bins produces a rather poor fit with @xmath50 .",
    "this poor fit is also obvious in figure  [ fig : coirlf ] as the single schechter function fit shown with a solid line is only marginally consistent with the data points and their formal uncertainties .",
    "it is possible that a schechter function is intrinsically a poor functional form for the co lf . on the other hand ,",
    "a schechter function successfully describes many other lfs including the hi lf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is also a theoretical basis in that it is the functional form associated with the halo mass function in the press - schechter formulation of the structure formation @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for such a large @xmath51 value is that there are two ( or more ) distinct populations of galaxies in the sample , similar to the situation with the fir luminosity function as noted by @xcite . in the fir ,",
    "the light - to - mass ratio for the starburst population is systematically enhanced by 1 - 2 orders of magnitudes over the field population .",
    "the co luminosity is also thought to be elevated significantly among the intense nuclear starburst systems @xcite , and this may materialize as two distinct populations in the co lf as well .",
    "there are 14 mergers / starburst systems in our sample , and eight of these fall within the last two bins and account for about 40% of the galaxies in these bins .",
    "when a best fit schechter function is derived using only the first 8 bins dominated by normal field galaxies , the @xmath51 value drops to 13 , which is a significant improvement .",
    "the schechter function fit for the bins dominated by normal galaxies gives : @xmath52 mpc@xmath4 mag@xmath13 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 jy km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath39 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the difference between all schechter parameters for the two limiting situations of treating the non - detected galaxies as upper limits or zero detections is smaller than 2% .",
    "such a small difference is expected since we have less than 4% upper limits in our sample .",
    "similarly , including or excluding virgo galaxies has only a minor impact , as discussed above ( see   [ sec:60lf ] ) .",
    "as an independent check of our co lf derived using the fir selection , we also derive a co luminosity function using an optical @xmath0-band selected sample .",
    "the method of deriving the co lf is similar to the method used for the infrared selected galaxies : we use the @xmath25 method and rescaling of the number of galaxies using a complete sample , which is the revised shapley - ames ( rsa ) catalog by @xcite in this case .",
    "a declination cut off of @xmath56 and a galactic longitude limit of @xmath57 are adopted as part of the sample definition .",
    "this makes the total surveyed area equal to 60% of the sky .",
    "our brightness selection criterion is @xmath58 .",
    "accounting for different hubble types correctly is a difficult issue . since co emission is generally very weak or undetected among early type galaxies , only the spiral and irregular galaxies",
    "are included in the analysis .",
    "the examination of the differential number counts for our @xmath0-band selected sample yields a power - law index @xmath59 , suggesting a reasonably good uniformity and completeness .",
    "the mean @xmath18 ratio for the sample is 0.33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vvm ] ) , similar to the fir selected sample .",
    "although we adopt the rsa catalog as a complete sample , a few galaxies satisfying our selection criteria are missing in the rsa ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the @xmath0-band magnitudes are taken from the rsa while the co fluxes are taken from the survey .",
    "there are 133 galaxies in the co survey that satisfy the selection criteria while the parent rsa catalog galaxies satisfying the selection criteria are 252 in total . in this case ,",
    "co fluxes for 13 galaxies ( 10% ) are upper limits .",
    "the co luminosity function derived for this @xmath0-band selected sample is shown on the figure  [ fig : coblf ] .",
    "this lf is very similar to co lf from the fir selected galaxies but with a lower characteristic luminosity @xmath43 and a larger scatter on the low luminosity end .",
    "the lower characteristic luminosity @xmath43 is a direct consequence of the absence of mergers in this sample .",
    "the best fit schechter parameters for the @xmath0-band derived co luminosity function are : @xmath60 mpc@xmath4 mag@xmath13 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 jy km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath39 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "one major source of uncertainty in the derived co luminosity function is that it is derived indirectly using the fir and optical @xmath0-band selection functions .",
    "a direct derivation from the observed co properties is possible in principle , but the complication associated with the _ a priori _ unknown line widths adds a significant uncertainty . instead we take advantage of the known tight correlation between fir and co luminosity in deriving the co lf for our sample . the 1.4 ghz radio luminosity function derived by @xcite using the radio - fir correlation and iras",
    "60 @xmath11 m flux density agrees very well with the radio lfs derived directly @xcite , giving some assurance to this technique .",
    "we have examined whether any systematic trends ( thus a bias ) exist in the @xmath64 ratio as a function of the 60 @xmath11 m flux density and luminosity . as shown in figure  [ fig:60/co ] , little trend is seen in this ratio , and the known linear correlation seems to hold well within the uncertainties for the entire range of flux density and luminosity .    deriving a luminosity function for one wavelength using",
    "a selection function at another wavelength may be robust enough to work even if the two quantities are correlated in a non - linear way .",
    "there is a known correlation between fir , co , and optical @xmath0-band luminosity for late type galaxies , but the correlations involving the @xmath0-band luminosity are shown to be non - linear ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , the co luminosity function derived using the fir selection function ( figure  [ fig : coirlf ] ) is in excellent agreement with the co lf derived using the @xmath0-band selection function ( figure  [ fig : coblf ] ) . the selection bias is present as some of the most co luminous galaxies ( merger starbursts ) are missed in the @xmath0-band selected sample .",
    "nevertheless the agreement is striking given the non - linear dependence between co and @xmath0-band luminosity .",
    "another source of a significant uncertainty is the uniformity of sampling and correctly accounting for the selection function for the sample of galaxies which is not complete by the adopted selection criteria .",
    "both the differential source count and the @xmath18 analysis suggest a non - uniform distribution of the sample galaxies ( see   [ sec : sample ] ) , and a slight bias towards galaxies brighter at 60@xmath23 may be responsible for this effect .",
    "the large scale structure also have influence in lowering @xmath18 value for our sample .",
    "the non - trivial nature of these effects are demonstrated by the fact that including and excluding virgo cluster galaxies from the sample make little difference to the differential source count and the @xmath18 values .",
    "co emission is a commonly used tracer of molecular hydrogen because co is one of the most abundant molecules in cold ism and because its excitation in astrophysical conditions is determined by collisions with hydrogen molecules .",
    "using the co lf derived above , we can for the first time estimate the total mass density of molecular gas in the local volume . adopting @xmath65 @xmath66 [ k",
    "km s@xmath13]@xmath13 ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath68 where @xmath36 is total co flux of a galaxy in jy km s@xmath13 and @xmath69 is luminosity distance in mpc .",
    "the molecular mass density in the local volume contributed by each luminosity bin is shown in figure  [ fig : h2mass ] . the dominant contribution to",
    "the mass density comes from galaxies around @xmath43 as expected .",
    "the summation over the 10 bins gives @xmath70 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "integration of the lf using the schechter parameters obtained in previous section gives a little bit smaller values : @xmath71 mpc@xmath4 for the fit trough all 10 bins , and @xmath72 mpc@xmath4 for fit trough first 8 bins .",
    "the second fit is more realistic , since it fits much better bins that dominate contribution to the total mass , i.e. bins around @xmath43 .",
    "the uncertainty stated is @xmath73 . the systematic uncertainty , which includes uncertainties in the flux measurements , distance determinations , and co - to - h@xmath2 conversion , is probably larger .",
    "unless otherwise is stated , we adopt @xmath74 mpc@xmath4 as an average value between values obtained from the fit and the direct summation .",
    "since the dependence of the gas mass density on the hubble constant ( @xmath75 [ km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13]@xmath13 ) is linear , this result can be written as @xmath76 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "the molecular hydrogen mass density in the local volume obtained from the @xmath0-band selected sample is @xmath77 mpc@xmath4 using a direct summation of the contribution of each galaxy and @xmath78 mpc@xmath4 using the best fit schechter parameters .",
    "values for the local molecular mass density obtained from the fir selected sample and the @xmath0-band selected sample are in good agreement .",
    "since we have better statistics for the larger fir selected sample , we adopt the local molecular gas mass density derived from the fir selected sample here on .",
    "using observed h@xmath2/hi mass ratio for different morphological types of galaxies and fraction of each morphological type @xcite estimated a similar value for @xmath79 .    in comparison , @xcite estimated the local atomic gas mass density of @xmath80 mpc@xmath4 from their arecibo hi strip survey while @xcite derived @xmath81 mpc@xmath4 from a sample of optically selected galaxies .",
    "therefore , the molecular gas mass density in the local volume is about 50 - 65% of the atomic mass density , and molecular gas represents a significant component of the total mass density of the neutral gas .",
    "the hi masses for 176 galaxies in our sample are known @xcite , and we have computed the hi mass density in the local volume using the same procedure as for the @xmath82 mass density . a summation over the hi mass weighted by @xmath28 gives a value consistent with the value obtain by @xcite .",

    "while the @xmath82 mass estimate for an individual galaxy may be uncertain to about 30% , the @xmath82 mass estimate for an _ ensemble _ of galaxies should be more reliable .",
    "in most galaxies , giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and cloud complexes dominate the total molecular gas mass , and adopting a conversion factor consistent with the values derived from the galactic gmcs should yield the most robust , mass - weighted estimates of gas masses .    among the low metallicity galaxies such as small magellanic cloud , co",
    "abundance may become low enough to affect the standard assumption of self - shielding and thermalization .",
    "the derived conversion factors are generally larger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and low metallicity dwarf galaxies are often undetected entirely in co. therefore the h@xmath2 mass and mass density derived from the co luminosity are strictly lower limits since molecular gas from these galaxies is missing from our analysis . on the other hand , the contribution by the low luminosity bins to our derived @xmath82 mass density is small ( see fig .  [",

    "therefore , we can largely neglect the effect of low metallicity , low luminosity galaxies in the derivation of the total molecular gas mass density for the local volume .    as discussed already in ",
    "[ sec : coirlf ] , the co emission may be elevated for the fir luminous galaxies with nuclear gas concentrations , and the co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor may be smaller than the canonical value . in the extreme environment of the nuclear starburst regions ,",
    "co emission arises from a multi - phase medium with sub - thermal excitation in the diffuse phase , and the standard conversion factor may over - estimate the molecular gas mass by a factor as large as 3 to 5 @xcite .",
    "such merger / starburst galaxies contribute significantly only for the top two luminosity bins in our co lf , and these two bins contribute less than 5% to the the total molecular gas mass density .",
    "therefore , the high co luminosity conversion factor does not have a significant impact on the derived total molecular mass density .",
    "similarly , increased co emission in the central 1 kpc of our galaxy and other galaxies has been suggested by recent observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s. httemeister , private communication ) .",
    "high angular resolution observations of gas - rich spiral galaxies frequently reveal a distinct component in the central 1 kpc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and some fraction of the total co luminosity may arise from such a component . on the other hand , among the virgo",
    "spirals studied by @xcite , a simple exponential distribution without a significant central component offers a good fit for the 12 out of 14 galaxies whose co emission is spatially well resolved ( i.e. , co detected at @xmath100 positions along the major axis ) .",
    "we made no attempt to account for enhanced co emission in the central kpc as the required information is generally not available .",
    "if the molecular gas properties of virgo spirals are typical of the late type field galaxies , then the possible contribution by the enhanced nuclear co emission in some galaxies may not be substantial .    in summary , using the canonical co - to - h@xmath2 conversion relation is problematic in some cases , such as low metallicity systems or luminous nuclear starburst systems , and co is a poor tracer of molecular gas among low metallicity dwarfs .",
    "for these reasons the local molecular gas mass density we infer is really a lower limit .",
    "however , since the majority of the mass contribution comes from @xmath43 galaxies whose molecular gas mass is dominated by gmcs like our galaxy , the use of the standard conversion factor still offers a fairly reliable estimate of the total molecular gas density for the local volume .",
    "utilizing the largest available co survey , the fcrao extragalactic co survey @xcite , the co luminosity function for the local volume is derived using ( 1 ) a fir selected sample of 200 galaxies that satisfy @xmath101 and ( 2 ) optical @xmath0-band selected sample of 133 galaxies . although neither of the samples is complete in terms of the sample selection , a sampling function is constructed using a well defined parent sample , and a non - parametric co luminosity function is derived from each sample . by examining the properties of the co luminosity functions , we conclude :    1 .",
    "the co luminosity functions derived from the fir and @xmath0-band selected samples are reasonably well described by a schechter function .",
    "the characteristic luminosity @xmath43 is around @xmath102 jy km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath39 .",
    "the low luminosity end of the co luminosity function is ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "similar values are obtained for the two co lfs derived using the two differently selected samples .",
    "the molecular gas mass density of the local volume is @xmath104 mpc@xmath4 which is about 50 - 65% of the hi gas mass density .",
    "this value is not strongly affected by variations in the co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor for low and high luminosity galaxies since it is dominated by the @xmath43 galaxies with @xmath105 jy km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath39 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "its dependence on the global co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor is linear and should be secure to within a factor of 30% or better .",

    ", we estimate the total cold gas mass density at the present epoch as a fraction of the critical density @xmath90 . when the he contribution is included , the cold gas mass density increase to @xmath92 .",
