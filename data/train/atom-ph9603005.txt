    "the properties of matter in magnetic fields of the extreme strength of @xmath6 gauss and higher have been the subject of numerous investigations since the early seventies , a major impetus being the discovery of pulsars in 1968 and the resulting interest in magnetized neutron stars .",

    "@xmath1 is the number of electrons that move in the coulomb field of a nucleus , localized at the origin with charge @xmath8 , and in a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath9 with vector potential @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ dm1 ] ) operates on antisymmetric wave functions @xmath11 of space and spin variables , and @xmath12 is the vector of pauli matrices . units are chosen such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; the energy unit is then four times the rydberg energy , i.e. , 54.4 ev .",
    "besides the atomic hamiltonian ( [ dm1 ] ) it is , of course , important to study the hamiltonian for molecules and matter in bulk , but the present paper is only concerned with ( [ dm1 ] ) , more specifically with its ground state energy e^(n , b , z)=_(,)=1(,h_n , b , z),[dm2]and the ground state electron density is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a ground state wave function .",
    "previous works on matter in strong magnetic fields can roughly be divided into two classes . on the one hand",
    "the focus has been on light atoms , in particular hydrogen with @xmath17 , on the other hand on heavy atoms with high @xmath0 .",
    "the present contribution falls into the second class . here",
    "@xmath18 plays a special role because iron is believed to be the most abundant element in the surface layer of a neutron star @xcite , @xcite . for such heavy atoms it is reasonable to expect that important aspects can be extracted from an asymptotic analysis in @xmath0 , and since @xmath6 g is large even compared with the natural atomic unit @xmath19 g , an asymptotic analysis in @xmath3",
    "is equally called for . and",
    "the magnetic field is actually measured in units of @xmath20 g. ]    the asymptotic behavior of the energy ( [ dm2 ] ) and density ( [ dm3 ] ) as @xmath21 , where @xmath2 is fixed and the magnetic field @xmath3 is allowed to vary with @xmath0 as well , has recently been rigorously studied by lieb , solovej and yngvason @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in these papers",
    "it was proved that the ground state properties of ( 1 ) can in this limit be evaluated _ exactly _ by five nonlinear functionals corresponding to different physics at different scales of the magnetic field @xmath3 as measured by powers of @xmath0 .",
    "these five parameter regions are characterized as follows : _ region 1 _ , @xmath22 ; _ region 2 _ , @xmath23 ; _ region 3 _ , @xmath24 ; _ region 4 _ , @xmath25 ; _ region 5 _ , @xmath26 .",
    "here @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 means respectively that the ratio @xmath30 tends to @xmath31 , @xmath32 or a constant @xmath33 as as @xmath34 .",
    "the asymptotic theories corresponding to regions 1 - 3 are semiclassical theories of thomas - fermi type that have been extensively applied to neutron stars in the past , see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite",
    ". salient features of atoms in region 5 were captured by a different density functional theory already in the papers @xcite and @xcite . however , the conditions on the surface of a typical neutron star correspond rather to region 4 , and this asymptotic region is also the most interesting one from the mathematical point of view .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it is shown that it can be described by a functional of a novel type , where the variable is not a density , but a function with values in density _",
    "matrices_. moreover , this theory covers regions 3 and 5 as limiting cases .",
    "we refer to it as the density matrix ( dm ) theory .    in view of the fact that the dm theory is an exact limit of quantum mechanics it is important to know its properties in some detail .",
    "being an asymptotic theory it is clear that it does not encompass the same information as the full hamiltonian at finite @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "in particular the dm theory does not capture exchange - correlation effects , and it is a theory of very strong fields in the sense that all electrons are confined to the lowest landau band .",
    "these features should not be considered as a shortcoming of the dm theory , however .",
    "in fact , the hardest part of the derivation of the limit theorems in @xcite is precisely to prove rigorously that contributions from exchange and higher landau bands vanish in the limit considered .",
    "the dm theory should be judged in its own merits : it is enormously more simple numerically than the full quantum mechanical problem ( [ dm2 ] ) and it is a well defined starting point for more refined approximations .    in the present contribution",
    "we report on a numerical study of the dm theory for atoms .",
    "we have computed ground state energies and electronic density profiles over a wide range of parameters and compared them with results obtained by different methods . in particular we compare the dm theory to the semiclassical theory that applies in region 3 , the simple density functional theory for region 5 , and also to other density functional @xcite , @xcite and hf @xcite calculations .",
    "the difference between dm and hf calculations of ground state energies is less than 2% where data are available so that comparison can be made .",
    "this is remarkable in view of the fact that for standard thomas fermi theory with @xmath35 the scott term , which corrects for the rough treatment of the electrons close to the nucleus in tf theory , must be incorporated in order to achieve such a good numerical agreement , cf .",
    "thus , at least at this field strength , dm theory is closer to hf theory than might have been expected . a more precise statement requires an analysis of the next to leading order terms in the asymptotic expansion of the ground state energy .",
    "such an analysis has yet to be carried out .",
    "another point where the dm theory differs from semiclassical theories is in the possibility of negative ionization .",
    "it is a general feature of thomas - fermi type theories , based on potential theoretical arguments , cf .",
    "@xcite , that the number of bound electrons never exceeds @xmath0 . for the quantum mechanical problem",
    "the meaning of this is simply that the binding energy of an excess electron must necessarily be of lower order in @xmath0 than the ground state energy .",
    "on the other hand it is known that a magnetic field enhances binding , for instance the hamiltonian ( 1 ) with @xmath36 has infinitely many bound states for @xmath37 @xcite . in the limit of extremely strong fields in region 5 the negative charge",
    "can even be as large as @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the only rigorous results on the dm theory concern this extreme limit , but our numerical computations clearly show negative ionization that increases with @xmath3 . it seems , however , that in order to approach the @xmath38 value extremely strong fields are needed ; even at fields as strong ) can be raised in such extreme fields , even for very heavy atoms .",
    "] as @xmath39 g the excess charge for iron is only  about 23 % .",
    "our interest in negative ionization is also motivated by its relation to another question , the binding of atoms into molecules and chains .",
    "although a rigorous mathematical theorem linking these two aspects of binding does not seem to exist , it is a fact that in regions 1 - 3 , i.e. , for @xmath40 , molecular binding energies are vanishingly small compared to ground state energies , whereas in region 5 binding becomes extremely strong : for a diatomic molecule the binding energy is 6 times the ground state energy of an individual atom ! the question whether iron is weakly or strongly bound at field strengths of the order @xmath6 g has been controversial over the past 25 years .",
    "the best hf results @xcite indicate weak or no binding , but the computations are difficult for they amount to subtracting one large number from another .",
    "it is decisive to treat the molecules and the individual atoms consistently by the same numerical methods so that unavoidable errors cancel as far as possible .",
    "since the dm theory is numerically much simpler than hf theory it is easier to achieve this in the former and we shall return to the binding question in a separate paper .",
    "the atomic computations presented here are a necessary preparation for the study of molecules and chains .",
    "the density matrix theory @xcite , @xcite is based on an energy functional , where the variable is a mapping @xmath41 : @xmath42 from @xmath43 into density matrices , i.e. , nonnegative trace class operators on @xmath44 . in a magnetic field of strength @xmath3 these operators have to satisfy the condition 0_*r*_(b/(2))i[dm4]for all @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the integral kernel of @xmath47 and put @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the _ density matrix functional _ for an atom with nuclear charge @xmath0 is defined by @xmath50 & = & -\\int   \\left [ { \\partial^2 \\gamma_{{\\bf r}_\\perp}(z , z')\\over\\partial z'^2 } \\right]_{z'=z } \\ , d^3{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } - z\\int { \\uprho_\\gamma ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}})\\over |{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}|}\\,d^3{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } }    \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { 1\\over 2}\\int\\int { \\uprho_\\gamma ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}})\\uprho_\\gamma ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}')\\over |{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}'| } \\,d^3{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}'\\,d^3{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}. \\label{dm : n_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the density matrix theory the electrostatic interactions are treated classically but the kinetic energy for the motion along the magnetic field quantum mechanically by the @xmath51 term . in directions perpendicular to the field",
    "the motion is restricted by the hard core   condition ( [ dm4 ] ) .",
    "this condition reflects the fact that the density of states per unit area for free electrons in the lowest landau band is @xmath52 .",
    "the functional ( [ dm : n_1 ] ) is plausible if one thinks of @xmath46 as an approximation to @xmath53 where @xmath16 is a normalized ground state wave function . in the parameter region",
    "@xmath54 the electrons are confined to the lowest landau band , and the pauli hamiltonian @xmath55 ^ 2 $ ] , restricted to the lowest landau band , is precisely @xmath51 .",
    "the ground state energy for @xmath1 electrons in dm theory is e^(n , b , z)=\\{e^ [ ] : } .[dm6 ] as shown in @xcite , theorem 4.3 , there is a unique minimizer for this variational problem , i.e. , e^(n , b , z)=e^[^_n , b , z]with a unique @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding density , @xmath57 , satisfies @xmath58 , if @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , if @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a number depending on @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "as explained in the next section , the minimization problem ( [ dm6 ] ) amounts to seeking at each @xmath63 the lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a one - dimensional schrdinger hamiltonian @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the self - consistent potential generated by the nucleus and @xmath57 .",
    "the density matrix theory is in fact a two parameter theory with parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 due to the _ scaling relations _",
    "e^(n , b , z)=z^3 e^(,,1)[dm8 ] and ^_n , b , z(r)=z^4^_,,1(zr).[dm9 ] in particular , the ratio to @xmath0 of the maximal number of electrons that a nucleus can bind in dm theory , @xmath68 , is a function of @xmath69 alone .",
    "the dm theory holds a special position in the study of the properties of matter in strong magnetic field because it provides an _ asymptotically exact _ description of the quantum mechanical ground state energy @xmath70 and electron density @xmath71 as @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 tend to infinity with @xmath2 fixed and @xmath72 .",
    "the following theorems are proved in @xcite , theorems 1.1 and 8.1 :    let @xmath1 , @xmath34 with @xmath2 fixed . if @xmath72 , then e^(n , b , z)/e^(n , b , z)1 .",

    "the shape of atoms in dm theory is discussed in section iv in connection with figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that by the limit theorems ii.1 and ii.2 the dm theory is a theory of _ heavy _ atoms .",
    "we have chosen iron with @xmath18 as our reference because of its astrophysical importance . by the scaling relations ( [ dm8 ] ) and ( [ dm9 ] ) it is simple to transform the results to other values of @xmath0 . as seen from the figures",
    "the atom is approximately spherical when the magnetic field is not too strong ( @xmath76 ca .",
    "gauss for iron ) , but becomes increasingly elongated as the field goes up .",
    "in fact , as shown in @xcite the limiting cases @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the dm theory can be described by simpler theories that we now review briefly , referring to @xcite and @xcite for details .    the weak field limit , @xmath78 , is the thomas - fermi theory for atoms in strong magnetic fields , where only the lowest landau band is taken into account ( as in dm theory ) .",

    "moreover , _ in this section magnetic fields are measured in gauss and energies in kev _ to facilitate comparison with astrophysical data and other computations . to transform into the units in which the original hamiltonian ( [ dm1 ] ) is written",
    "it should be kept in mind that there the energy unit is 54.4 ev and the unit for magnetic field strength is @xmath222 g. the dimensionless parameter @xmath223 has for @xmath18 and @xmath5 g the value @xmath224 .",
    "this may seem small for region 4 , but as discussed in @xcite , the relevant semiclassical parameter is really @xmath225 and at the quoted values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 we have @xmath226 .    figures 1 and 2 show contour plots of the electronic densities of iron atoms with @xmath227 according to dm theory at four different field strengths , ranging from @xmath77 to @xmath228 gauss .",
    "it is evident that in the weakest field the bulk of the electrons is spherically distributed around the nucleus .",

    "a comparison of some of these values with results obtained by other methods is given in the next section .",
    "table ii shows the results tor @xmath220 as a function of @xmath3 in dm theory . at the extremely strong field of @xmath39 gauss",
    ", corresponding to @xmath232 , one finds @xmath233 , which is still quite far from the hs value @xmath114 .",
    "however , compared with thomas fermi theories , where @xmath220 is always 1 @xcite , the negative ionization is noticeable even for the weaker fields .",
    "the value @xmath234 for iron at @xmath235 g corresponds to an excess negative charge of 1.2 electrons .",
    "the binding energy of the excess charge in dm theory is shown in table iii .",
    "as remarked at the end of section iii a precise determination of @xmath220 is difficult and the values quoted should be regarded as lower bounds at the respective field strengths .",
    "as discussed in section ii , dm theory simplifies in the two limits , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which are respectively described by the stf and hs theories . in order to study the rate of this convergence we have compared the ground state energies at @xmath86 in these three models in table iv and plotted them in fig .",
    "it is remarkable how closely the stf ground state energy approximates the dm energy even at fields as strong as @xmath236 gauss , while the electronic densities in dm theory deviate appreciably from the spherical shape of stf theory already at @xmath6 gauss as seen in fig .   1 .",
    "thus in this case at least , the energy calculations are much less sensitive to the details of the model than density calculations",
    ". there is , however , another way of comparing the densities in stf and dm theories . in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted together the stf density and the _ spherically averaged _ dm density , and one sees that they are quite close for the bulk of the electrons , up to fields of the order @xmath6 g.    it is apparent from fig 3 that the dm energy values approach the hs values as the field goes up , but the convergence is very slow and the asymptotic regime has not yet been reached at the strongest fields considered for the dm computations . on the other hand , it is interesting how well the hs density ( [ dm22 ] ) fits the dm density integrated over the cross section of the atom as shown in fig . 5 .    finally , in tables v and vi we compare the ground state energy @xmath237 computed in the dm and stf theories with values obtained by some other methods in the literature .",
    "the comparison is made for iron at @xmath6 g , since this case has been considered in a number of sources . in table v the value for dm theory is compared with hartree fock ( hf ) @xcite , density functional @xcite , @xcite , restricted variational ( rv ) @xcite , thomas - fermi - dirac ( tfd ) @xcite and stf calculations @xcite . in table 5",
    "the splitting of the ground state energy into its various parts ( kinetic , attractive , repulsive , exchange ) is compared for dm , stf and hf calculations .",
    "we have carried out a numerical study of the density matrix model that describes exactly the quantum mechanical ground state of atoms in a homogeneous magnetic field in the asymptotic limit when the nuclear charge @xmath0 , the electron number @xmath1 and the magnetic field @xmath3 tend to @xmath32 with @xmath2 fixed and @xmath4 .",
    "the calculations demonstrate the following features of heavy atoms in high magnetic fields as the field strength increases : a transition from an approximately spherical shape to a highly elongated shape , accompanied by a decrease in ground state energy and increasing ability to bind excess electrons . we have also compared the dm model with the semiclassical thomas - fermi theory and the one dimensional density functional theory that describe respectively its low and high field limits .",
    "when @xmath238 is of order unity these simpler theories are numerically and conceptually wrong and the full dm theory should be used .",
    "the quantitative agreement of dm theory with hartree fock calculations is quite good in strong fields ; for iron at @xmath5 g the difference in binding energies is less than 2 % .",
