    "during the last two decades there is significant progress in angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) due to improved energy and angle resolution by at least an order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "furthermore , advances in improving sample quality and characterization have enabled arpes to become a leading tool in the investigation of otherwise hidden information about copper - oxide based superconducting ( cosc ) materials .",
    "arpes directly exposes the momentum and frequency dependent imaginary part of the single particle green s function , a quantity which sits at the heart of quantum many - body theory .    as the wave - number of the incident photon",
    "is varied , a smooth transition of the intensity resembling a waterfall - like pattern is observed in arpes of the cosc materials at various hole or electron doping concentrations@xcite .",
    "while it has been argued that this could be a matrix element effect@xcite , similar intensity features are obtained by means of theoretical models and recently in different materials and under various conditions@xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations showed such intensity pattern in 2d hubbard models@xcite .",
    "in addition , it was suggested@xcite that these waterfall - like features of the arpes intensity are caused by the gradual transfer of the spectral weight from the lowest energy quasiparticle peak at the wavevector @xmath2 to the higher energy so - called `` string '' states as the incident wave - vector gradually moves towards @xmath4 along the nodal direction of the brillouin zone .",
    "this suggestion was based on a calculation of the single hole spectral function in the @xmath0 model by _ broadening _ the peaks of the spectral function corresponding to the string excitations@xcite .",
    "later , the broadening required to achieve a reasonable agreement with the apres spectra was obtained by considering the effects of optical phonons at finite temperatures@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use the @xmath0 and @xmath1 models within the limits of the spin - wave theory by linearizing the hole - spin - deviation interaction and within the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) to study the effects of doping on the single - hole spectral functions .",
    "we show that the _ broadening _ of the peaks corresponding to the high energy string excitations can be achieved naturally as an effect of doping , thus , leading to a smooth waterfall - like intensity distribution along the nodal direction of the brillouin zone .    sometime ago",
    ", arpes studies@xcite on the undoped parent cosc compounds reveal the existence of a relatively well - defined low - energy quasiparticle peak at wavevector @xmath5 which follows a dispersion with a bandwidth of similar magnitude to that calculated in ref .  .",
    "rather recently , however , fournier et al.@xcite , reported that the quasiparticle residue as a function of doping is essentially zero below approximately @xmath6 hole concentration .",
    "in addition , shen et al.@xcite have reported arpes measurements where the quasiparticle peak has a broad line shape ( much broader than the arpes resolution ) and they also found what they call a `` paradoxical shift '' of the chemical potential within the mott gap .",
    "our results indicate that these seemingly contradictory findings can be reconciled using the calculations reported in the present paper .",
    "we find that the lowest energy quasiparticle peak observed near @xmath7 in the undoped cuprates@xcite , is very sensitive to a small amount of doping .",
    "namely , the quasiparticle residue rapidly goes to zero as a function of doping concentration , and , in addition , it is known that optical phonons broaden the peak@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that the facts , that the quasiparticle peak is broad and that the chemical potential is shifted relative to the quasiparticle peak position , are not two independent effects . when we repeated our calculation by broadening the quasiparticle peak we found that the broadening itself leads to a very significant shift of the chemical potential relative to the lowest energy quasiparticle position which can be understood in a straightforward manner .",
    "furthermore , we find that , at low doping , elliptical hole pockets form , which are centered around @xmath3 , in agreement with rather recent quantum oscillation measurements@xcite .",
    "our calculated intensity of the spectral function shows that there are luminous elliptical rings centered around the points @xmath3 of the brillouin zone .",
    "we argue that these rings could be related to the banana - like features seen in arpes reported on the under - doped cosc materials@xcite .",
    "our formulation , which is based on the existence of antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range - order ( lro ) , can not yield a spectrum sharing the single - banana - like feature seen in arpes , where only one side around the @xmath3 is luminous .",
    "the reason lies in the reflection symmetry about the line @xmath8 of the brillouin zone which is present when af - lro is present in the system .",
    "therefore , we view the banana - like shape as a result produced by `` scissoring '' the elliptical ring along the above symmetry line , an operation which breaks this symmetry required by the af - lro . the measurements presented in ref .",
    "were carried out in materials which lack af - lro .",
    "linear spin - wave ( lsw ) theory can describe the undoped and lightly doped antiferromagnets as long as af - lro is present in the system .",
    "in the undoped cosc parent compounds , which are antiferromagnetic insulators@xcite , the af - lro disappears at a very low doping concentration .",
    "for example , in @xmath9 , the af - lro is destroyed at doping @xmath10 0.015@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic fluctuations persist even at higher doping concentrations and short - range spin correlations are observed in the inelastic neutron scattering experiments at reasonably high doping concentrations@xcite .",
    "calculations on @xmath0 and related models also show the staggered magnetization of the system to go to zero as the undoped system is gradually doped with holes@xcite .    in order to study the 2d hole - doped antiferromagnet , we have considered the @xmath0 and @xmath1 models working within the limits of the spin - wave theory , by linearizing the hole - spin - deviation interaction and by adapting the nca . within the nca the self - energy diagrams are considered for both holes and magnons and the dyson s equation",
    "is solved to obtain the one - particle green s function .",
    "the contribution of the magnon polarization bubbles are considered and , thus , the magnon - mediated hole - hole interaction is included .",
    "we should mention here that we do not use the rigid band approximation which uses the hole bands of the single hole calculation to obtain the hole spectra at finite concentration neither do we use any approximate form of the hole spectral function to write it as a sum of a coherent quasi - particle peak and an incoherent continuum @xcite .",
    "hole and magnon green s functions for a 2d @xmath0 model at finite - doping , using lsw approximation and nca , have been studied earlier ( ref . ) .",
    "however , the goal and focus of the present study is quite different ; as already discussed , there are rather recent high resolution arpes studies which exhibit the existence of the waterfall features@xcite and other studies which reveal the shape of the most intense part of the brillouin zone near the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "our calculations are done with the aim to understand , if possible , these and related features of the arpes measurements .",
    "in addition , as we will discuss in the paper , our results differ significantly from the results of ref .  .",
    "for example , we find that only a few percent hole concentration is enough to destroy the long - range antiferromagnetic order , while in ref .",
    "results for the spectral function were presented for up to hole doping @xmath11 , where we find that this approach breaks down precisely because there is no lro for this level of doping .",
    "our approach discussed above relies on the existence of af - lro both within the model and in the materials which we plan to apply our findings , therefore , we only hope to capture the physics of the real materials in the limit of light doping .",
    "it is known , however , that even in the above models the af - lro may be unstable upon doping leading to other forms of order , such as spiral order@xcite , stripe ordering@xcite or phase separation instability@xcite .",
    "therefore , we begin by assuming that the af - lro is present in the system at low doping and we proceed with a perturbative approach which asserts that spin wave excitations are well - defined in the system . if the af order ceases to exist and it gets replaced by any of the above phases , this should show up as an instability in our calculation .",

    "we find that the residue of the quasiparticle peak at @xmath98 dies out quickly with doping and in particular in the @xmath1 model it becomes negligible away from the undoped limit .",
    "in addition , we find that when we broaden the lowest energy quasiparticle peak , the spectral function shares most of its features with those obtained by high resolution arpes studies@xcite .",

    "we find that as we increase doping the fermi `` surface '' starts as four ellipses around the wave vectors @xmath100 and the topology gradually changes where the ellipses increase in size and become connected to each other giving rise to new pockets around @xmath101 and @xmath102 . at",
    "even somewhat higher doping these newly formed pockets disappear and disconnected parts of the fermi surface are obtained centered around ( 0,0 ) and @xmath103 . a similar change of topology as function of @xmath35 occurs in the @xmath1 model , the main difference being that the @xmath104-space anisotropy of the spectral intensity is reduced making the hole pockets more circular than elongated .",
    "similar pockets have been inferred from quantum oscillation measurements@xcite at relatively low doping .",
    "we also find that the intensity plot of the spectral intensity has features with a ring - like shape which are centered around the wave vectors @xmath100 .",
    "our calculations are restricted in the regime where there is long - range antiferromagnetic order present in the system where the hole spectra should be symmetric against reflections with respect to the @xmath105 line in the brillouin zone . as a result spectra having banana - like shape as seen experimentally@xcite , can not exist within the models studied here when there is af order .",
    "we argued , however , that it is possible when the long - range antiferromagnetic order is destroyed upon further doping that these features with the ring - like shape of the spectral intensity plot could transform to a half ring - like shape ( i.e. , a ring centered at @xmath75 which is scissored along the @xmath105 line ) which might resemble the banana shape pockets near @xmath75 seen in the experiment@xcite .",
    "we have also examined the role of doping in producing the waterfall - like features in the spectral function as seen in arpes . in particular , it was suggested in ref .   that these waterfall - like features is the result of spectral weight transfer from the lowest energy quasiparticle peak to the higher `` string '' states as the momentum varies from @xmath75 to @xmath4 along the diagonal of the brillouin zone .",
    "we find that doping significantly broadens the high energy `` string '' states and this allows a gradual and continuous flow of spectral weight from the quasi - particle peak at @xmath106 to the high energy peak at ( 0,0 ) .",
    "we also find that doping does not broaden the lowest energy peak enough to have agreement with the experimental waterfall - like feature , thus , other hole decay mechanisms such as decay into phonons or broadening due to finite temperature@xcite may be needed .",
    "we wish to thank a. damascelli for useful discussions .",
    "for the numerical calculation , we always keep the energy resolution , i.e. , the finite - frequency step @xmath107 ( 0.005 t ) less than @xmath34 ( we used @xmath34 between 0.4 t and 0.01 t ) so that the lorentzian feature of the bare green s functions can be represented properly as also discussed in refs . .",

    "we find that the convergence of the self - consistent equations is slow for the doped antiferromagnet ( compared to the calculations done in ref . for obtaining the hole green s functions from undoped system ) .",
    "compared to the @xmath24 model the convergence is even slower for the @xmath0 model as they have a complete degeneracy in the bare hole energy . in order to obtain a quick convergence we update the spectral functions , in each iteration step , by mixing the values obtained from the last two iterations- a technique also adopted in ref . .",
    "we also notice poor convergence of self - consistent equations as @xmath92 becomes very small .",
    "when calculating the staggered magnetization , we use @xmath109 for both positive and negative @xmath110 .",

    "we note that in calculating the imaginary part of the hole self - energy , the energy convolution is utilized to get rid of the infinite integration limits .",

    "the numerical results coming from a system where the fermi level stays much higher than the quasi - particle energy has a smaller error due to finiteness of the @xmath34-used . while studying the hole energy bands from the doped system we have , thus , considered only the cases where the fermi energy is higher than the quasi - particle peak position ( which is at @xmath116 for @xmath94 ) .",

    "[ figd4 ] ) and the dos low energy peaks move towards higher values at higher dopings ( also see ref . ) .",

    "the dependence of our magnon spectra with doping is also consistent with the vanishing of the staggered magnetization at @xmath118 .",
    "namely , the renormalized magnon energy softens with doping , for small @xmath104 values , becoming practically zero for @xmath121 ( for @xmath80 ) .    because of the above disagreement we subjected our code to several tests .",

    "<S> we study the hole and magnon spectral functions as a function of hole doping in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 models working within the limits of the spin - wave theory , by linearizing the hole - spin - deviation interaction and by adapting the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the staggered magnetization decreases rather rapidly with doping and it goes to zero at a few percent of hole concentration in both @xmath0 and the @xmath1 model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that with doping , the residue of the quasiparticle peak at @xmath2 decreases rapidly with doping and the spectral function is in agreement with high resolution angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies of the copper - oxide superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the observed large shift of the chemical potential inside the mott gap is found to be a result of broadening of the quasiparticle peak . </S>",
    "<S> we find pockets centered at @xmath3 , similar to those observed by quantum oscillation measurements , ( i ) with an elliptical shape with large eccentricity along the anti - nodal direction in the case of the @xmath0 model , and ( ii ) with an almost circular shape in the case of the @xmath1 model . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the spectral intensity distribution in the doped antiferromagnet has a waterfall - like patten along the nodal direction of the brillouin zone , a feature that is also seen in arpes measurements . </S>"
