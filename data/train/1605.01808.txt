    "qkd allows two distant and trusted parties , alice and bob , to create a secret key through the use of quantum and classical communications , and can be implemented using discrete - variable ( dv ) or cv quantum states . in dv - qkd protocols ,",

    "is realized by single - photon detectors e.g. , @xcite , while in the latter technology detection is realised by more efficient and faster detectors , such as homodyne ( or heterodyne ) detectors e.g. , @xcite .",
    "qkd is mostly implemented experimentally in a prepare - and - measure ( pm ) type scheme e.g. , @xcite , where alice prepares the quantum states which are then transmitted over an insecure quantum channel towards bob , who measures the received quantum states , resulting in creation of correlated data between the two trusted parties .",
    "each pm scheme can be represented in an equivalent entanglement - based ( eb ) scheme , where alice generates a two - mode entangled state , with one mode being kept by alice and the other mode being transmitted over an insecure quantum channel .",
    "alice and bob then proceed to invoke a qkd protocol by measuring their own modes to create correlated data . in both the pm scheme and eb scheme , after generation of the correlated data , alice and bob proceed with classical postprocessing including sifting , parameter estimation , reconciliation and privacy amplification over a public ( but authenticated ) classical channel , to generate a secret key even in the presence of eve ( a potential eavesdropper ) .",
    "cv - qkd protocols using gaussian resources have been well analysed in theory and experimentally implemented e.g. , @xcite . in the gaussian pm scheme @xcite , the prepared quantum states are either coherent states or squeezed states which are modulated by gaussian distributions .",
    "each gaussian pm scheme can be represented by an equivalent eb scheme @xcite in which alice generates a two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state .",
    "although gaussian quantum states are a well - established resource from both a theoretical and an experimental perspective ( for review see@xcite ) , the use of non - gaussian states in the implementation of cv - qkd protocols has also garnered interest , e.g. @xcite .",
    "such studies can be motivated in part by the fact that non - gaussian operations such as photon subtraction @xcite and photon addition @xcite on an incoming tmsv state can lead to higher levels of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is widely anticipated that the use of satellites will assist in the deployment of qkd over global scales .",
    "thus , it is important to analyse the effectiveness of cv - qkd protocols over atmospheric channels towards ( and from ) leo satellites .",
    "such channels are highly fading in nature since the transmissivity of the channel fluctuates due to atmospheric effects .",
    "cv - qkd protocols using gaussian resources have been studied over atmospheric channels in @xcite .",
    "however , works on using non - gaussian resources in cv - qkd protocols have focussed on fixed - attenuation channels .",
    "thus , it remains unclear whether non - gaussian entangled states can be effective in the implementation of cv - qkd protocols over atmospheric fading channels ( in terms of the quantum key generation rates ) .",
    "the entanglement - generation rate produced by non - gaussian entangled states passing through atmospheric channels has been recently studied by us @xcite . in this present work",
    "we extend such studies to consider bounds on the actual quantum key rates generated by such non - gaussian transfer .",
    "we will be particularly interested in comparing such quantum key rates with those arising from gaussian transfer over atmospheric channels , and gaussian and non - gaussian transfer over fixed - attenuation channels .",
    "we will focus on transmission fading caused by the beam wander @xcite , which is expected to dominate photon losses in earth - to - satellite channels .",
    "to explore non - gaussian key generation we will utilize non - gaussian entangled states which are created just - in - time via photonic subtraction from incoming gaussian states . in our security analysis",
    ", we will include the effects of channel fading , the probabilistic production of the non - gaussian states , and the most likely imperfections in a cv - qkd protocol ( excess noise , inefficient and noisy detectors , and non - perfect reconciliation algorithms ) . a schematic illustration of the cv - qkd protocol we adopt in a fading uplink configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme1 ] .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in section ii",
    ", our cv - qkd protocol using a non - gaussian resource is described , and its security analysis is discussed in detail . in section iii , the performance of the protocol over the atmospheric channels is presented and compared to the corresponding protocol over the fixed - attenuation channels . finally , concluding results are provided in section iv .",
    "we now describe the implementation of a cv - qkd protocol using non - gaussian states and outline how to determine the quantum key rates of this protocol for the atmospheric channel .      in this work",
    ", we will focus on the implementation of a specific cv - qkd protocol in the eb scheme , in which a two - mode non - gaussian entangled state is shared between alice and bob .",
    "initially , we focus on the case where the non - gaussian state is created just - in - time via photonic subtraction from an incoming gaussian state - a non - gaussian operation which has previously been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the protocol begins with alice possessing a tmsv state , @xmath0 , described in the fock basis as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , and where @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the squeezing parameter ( indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 indicate the two modes ) .",
    "the two - mode squeezing in db is given by @xmath7 .",
    "since the tmsv state is a gaussian state , it can be completely described by its first moment , which is zero , and its covariance matrix ( cm ) given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a @xmath10 identity matrix , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the quadrature variance of each mode . while mode  @xmath5 is held by alice , the other mode undergoes the photon - subtraction operation . to invoke this operation",
    ", mode  @xmath6 of alice s tmsv state interacts with a vacuum mode in a beam splitter bs1 with transmissivity @xmath13 and reflectivity @xmath14 , with one of the outputs of the beam splitter feeding a single - photon detector . when the detector registers one photon , a pure photon - subtracted squeezed ( pss ) state is heralded in mode  @xmath15 , the non - measured output of the beam splitter , defined as @xmath16 , which is a non - gaussian entangled state .",
    "the normalized state arising from this process and its creation probability @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 , where @xcite @xmath19 after applying the photon subtraction , the output of the beam splitter , mode  @xmath20 is transmitted towards bob over an unsecured quantum channel with transmissivity @xmath21 . in any real - world implementation of this cv - qkd protocol , the quantum state preparation at alice s side will produce some additional noise . in the following we refer to this excess noise as @xmath22 .",
    "the qkd protocol then proceeds with bob making a homodyne detection of the amplitude or phase quadrature of the received mode @xmath23 , and alice measures both quadratures using a heterodyne detection on mode  @xmath5 to create correlated data .",
    "bob s realistic homodyne detection will have an efficiency @xmath24 and an electronic noise @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the efficiency can be _ modeled _ by placing a beam splitter bs2 of transmissivity @xmath24 before an ideal homodyne detector .",
    "this detector s electronic noise can be modeled by an epr state , @xmath26 , of quadrature variance @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "one input port of the beam splitter bs2 is the received mode @xmath23 , and the second input port is fed by one half of the epr state , mode  @xmath29 , while the output ports are mode  @xmath30 ( which is measured by the ideal homodyne detector ) and mode @xmath31 .",
    "our cv - qkd protocol using the pss state is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme2 ] .        since non - gaussian states are not completely described by the first and second moments of the quadrature operators , we are not able to quantify the evolution of our pss state solely through the cm .",
    "thus , we will employ the kraus representation @xcite in order to analyze the evolution of our pss state through the channel . considering a quantum state with density operator @xmath32 as the input of a trace - preserving completely positive channel",
    ", the output density operator of the channel can be described in an operator - sum representation of the form @xmath33 , where the kraus operators @xmath34 satisfy @xmath35 , with @xmath9 being the identity operator .",
    "the kraus operators of a fixed - attenuation channel with transmissivity @xmath36 can be written as @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the binomial coefficient . from these operators",
    "it can then be shown that the elementary density operator @xmath39 after the evolution through the fixed - attenuation channel can be written as @xcite , @xmath40 considering the initial density operator of our pss state as the following @xmath41 the density operator of the output mixed state @xmath42 can be calculated in the fock basis through the use of eq .",
    ", giving @xmath43 with @xmath44 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 , otherwise @xmath47 .    we can compute the lower bound on the actual key rate , @xmath48 , of the protocol by replacing the shared non - gaussian state between alice and bob @xmath49 with a gaussian state @xmath50 having the same mean value and cm , resulting in @xmath51 . the output mixed state @xmath42 has zero mean and cm in the following form @xmath52 where @xmath53 since the output density operator @xmath42 possesses an infinite number of elements , we are required to deploy a numerical method to approximate @xmath42 by limiting its size , i.e. creating a truncated @xmath42 . here",
    ", a very similar approach to that described in our previous work @xcite can be used to estimate @xmath42 , and then calculate the elements of the cm @xmath54 through the use of eq .  .",
    "however , to determine the true resultant key rates ( not just lower bounds ) for the non - gaussian state , eq .   must be utilized .",
    "there is also an analytical approach to obtain the cm @xmath55 @xcite , in which we first need to calculate the cm of the initial pss state @xmath16 given by @xmath56 and where @xmath57 .",
    "note the pss state @xmath16 has zero mean .",
    "after transmission of mode  @xmath15 through a quantum channel with transmissivity @xmath21 and excess noise @xmath22 , the cm of the resulting mixed state @xmath42 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",

    "it is known in the typical point - to - point cv qkd , the reverse reconciliation ( rr ) scenario always leads to higher key rates than the direct reconciliation ( dr ) scenario @xcite .",
    "hence , we will only consider the rr scenario where bob s data is the reference of reconciliation .",
    "for a realistic reconciliation algorithm , the asymptotic key rate against collective attacks for rr is given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the reconciliation efficiency , @xmath72 is the mutual information between alice and bob s measurements after accounting for additional detector noise and efficiencies .",
    "@xmath73 is the holevo quantity , which gives an upper bound on the quantum information stolen by eve .",
    "we will assume bob makes the homodyne detection of @xmath74 , the amplitude quadrature of mode  @xmath75 .",
    "on the other side , alice invokes heterodyne detection by combining mode  @xmath5 with a vacuum mode on a balanced beam splitter , and applies homodyne detection on conjugate quadratures of the two output modes . due to the symmetry between the two conjugate quadratures",
    ", we only consider the measurement of the amplitude quadrature of mode  @xmath76 ( one output mode of the balanced beam splitter ) , which is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the amplitude quadrature of mode  @xmath5 prior to the heterodyne detection and @xmath79 is the amplitude quadrature of the vacuum input .",
