    "the concept of frames is relatively new and has its origins in harmonic and functional analysis , operator theory , linear algebra , and matrix theory .",
    "frames can be thought as a relaxation of a vector space basis .",
    "unlike a basis , a frame consists of vectors that are not necessarily linearly independent ; however , they still span the entire vector space . frames were born as a result of the limited capabilities of bases being utilized in signal processing and sampling theory . in particular , frames allow for redundancy , meaning a set of frame vectors may contain multiple copies of the same vector , and/or some of the vectors are linear combinations of other frame vectors .",
    "this property is useful in the fields of communications and signal processing where signals suffer from erasures or noise ; redundant frame vectors can then be used to reconstruct the original signal @xcite .",
    "one class of important frames are grassmannian frames , i.e. , those with low coherence where the maximum correlation between its vectors is minimized .",
    "they have connections to packings in grassmannian spaces , spherical codes , and strongly regular graphs .",
    "equiangular tight frames ( etfs ) are grassmanian frames which meet the welch bound and represent maximal packings of lines in real or complex space .    in this article we present a linear - time algorithm to construct partitions of a special class of complex etfs and prove that the subset norms of these partitions , i.e. , the norms of the sum of outer products of all the frame vectors in each subset , meet the operator norm bound specified by a theorem of marcus , spielman , and srivastava ( mss ) @xcite . finding algorithms to partition frames in general",
    "was described as an open problem in @xcite .",
    "we believe that our algorithm is the first of its kind for any known class of frames and in particular for etfs generated from skew - symmetric conference matrices .",
    "such algorithms are useful because not every partition satisfies the mss theorem ; a counterexample is given after theorem [ mss ] .",
    "on the other hand , we also prove that partitions of etfs whose subsets all have cardinality less than four must satisfy the mss bound .",
    "the proof of our algorithm relies on constructing special partitions that we call diagonal partitions since their subsets correspond to sub - block matrices along the diagonal of the gram matrix associated to each eft .",
    "fortunately , these gram matrices , when constructed from skew - symmetric conference matrices , have spectra that can be computed exactly . as a result",
    ", we obtain a bound on the subset norms of these diagonal partitions and show that it is sharper than the bound described by the following theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.5 ) , which we call the mss theorem .",
    "[ mss ] let @xmath0 be a positive integer and @xmath1 + @xmath2 be a set of vectors in @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4 where @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",

    "any partition that satisfies the bound in theorem [ mss ] will be called a mss partition .",
    "numerical experiments show that partitions of etfs with small subset cardinalities are mss partitions .",
    "on the other hand not all partitions are mss partitions ; numerical calculations reveal that given an etf with 32 vectors , a partition where one subset has cardinality 16 and all other subsets have cardinality 1 is not necessarily a mss partition .",
    "an example of such an invalid partition is one that contains the subset @xmath11 , where the values in this subset correspond to the indices of the vectors in the frame @xmath12 as constructed in section 2 .",
    "if we compute the subset norm of @xmath13 , then we find that its value is greater than the mss bound for @xmath14 .",
    "our main result is the following theorem , which states that partitions of a certain form , called diagonal partions , are in fact mss partitions and provides a bound on their subset norms that is sharper than ( [ eqn18 ] ) with @xmath15 .",

    "then for all diagonal partitions @xmath7 of the index set @xmath20 with @xmath21 for all @xmath22 , the subset norms satisfy @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formally state definitions and theorems that are employed in our analysis . in section 3",
    "we derive the norm formulas for a particular gram matrix called the @xmath25 matrix . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we relate norms formed from subsets of our frame to the norms of sub - blocks of the @xmath25 matrix . in section 6",
    "we prove theorem [ jhl ] our algorithm and describe our algorithm for constructing diagonal partitions .",
