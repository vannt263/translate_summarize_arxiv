    "the power needed to maintain the temperatures of the soft and hard components of the hot gas are @xmath8 erg s@xmath2 and @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 respectively .",
    "the energy needed for the soft component can be explained by 1% of kinetic energy from one supernova occurring every 3000 years , which is reasonable in the gc @xcite .",
    "however , the energy needed for the hard component can not be explained satisfactorily @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that a decaying sterile neutrino halo existing near the gc can solve the problem .",
    "the photons emitted by the decays of the sterile neutrinos can heat up the surrounding gas , and the energy is subsequently transferred to the entire region at the gc . for this scenario to account for the observational data , the sterile neutrino rest mass is required to be @xmath9 kev @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath0 x - ray mission has started to observe emission lines above 6 kev near the gc @xcite .",
    "the observed intensities of the emission lines , including ly@xmath10 ( 7.0 kev ) , ly@xmath11 ( 8.2 kev ) and ly@xmath12 ( 8.7 kev ) , from fe xxvi are @xmath13 ph @xmath14 s@xmath2 , @xmath15 ph @xmath14 s@xmath2 and @xmath16 ph @xmath14 s@xmath2 respectively @xcite . based on these results ,",

    "@xcite proposed that decaying sterile neutrinos can provide the excess 8.7 kev photons .",
    "as the emitted photon energy @xmath18 , the required @xmath19 is about 17 kev , which agrees with chan and chu s prediction ( 2008 ) .    by using the observed excess intensity of 8.7 kev photons and the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile with 21.5",
    "kpc scaled length to model the sterile neutrino halo , which means that the sterile neutrinos are the dominant dark matter component , @xcite calculated the sterile neutrino decay rate and mixing angle with active neutrinos to be @xmath20 s@xmath2 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "however , there is no evidence that the density profile of the sterile neutrino halo behaves like the nfw profile .",
    "if the sterile neutrinos are degenerate , the size of the halo can be very small ( radius @xmath22 pc ) @xcite . in this article",
    ", we extend our earlier work to account for the high temperature of the hot gas near the gc by including into the consideration of the @xmath0 excess of 8.7 kev photons ; we show that the existence of a degenerate halo of decaying sterile neutrinos can account for both simultaneously @xcite . in this model , the optically dense gas clouds inside and nearby the sterile neutrino halo absorbs most of the energy of the photons emitted by the decays of the sterile neutrinos .",
    "the energy is then transferred to the surrounding gas clouds by conduction ( mean free path @xmath23 pc ) .",
    "since the optical depth is larger than 1 , only a small portion of the decayed photons can escape from the gc and constitute the excess 8.7 kev emission .",
    "the calculated emission intensity from the decaying sterile neutrinos agrees with the observation as well as that required by @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", the sterile neutrino decay rate @xmath3 s@xmath2 and mixing angle @xmath24 , which are consistent with a low reheating temperature and suggest that sterile - active neutrino oscillation may be visible in near future experiments .",
    "sterile neutrinos may decay into active neutrinos and photons ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the energy of the photons is assumed to be @xmath26 kev .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 kev .",
    "since the size of a degenerate sterile neutrino halo with total mass @xmath28 and @xmath29 kev is much smaller than 20 pc , the total energy flux of the decayed photons within the field of view of @xmath0 ( solid angle @xmath30 ) is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 kpc is the distance to the gc and @xmath33 erg s@xmath2 is the total power emitted in the sterile neutrino decays ( the required power of the hard component of the hot gas near gc ) .",
    "the excess energy flux observed by @xmath0 is @xmath34 erg @xmath14 s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , only around 1% of photons can escape from the gc , and most of the emitted photons are first absorbed by the gas clouds inside the sterile neutrino halo and nearby .",
    "the optical depth @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the effective absorption cross section of 8.7 kev photons by different gas components including cold molecular hydrogen gas ( @xmath38h@xmath39 ) , warm atomic gas ( @xmath40=h , he ) hot ionized gas ( @xmath40=hot ) and very hot ionized gas ( @xmath40=vhot ) , @xmath41 is the number density of the gas components . assuming all the gas components follow the same density profile near the gc , which can be modelled by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 pc and @xmath44 are the core radius and core number density for the @xmath45-type gas component . for h molecular and atomic gases ,",
    "the average number densities within 450 pc are 74 @xmath46 and 0.9 @xmath46 respectively @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath47 @xmath46 and @xmath48 @xmath46 .",
    "since hydrogen and helium constitute 70.4% and 28.1% by mass in the interstellar medium respectively @xcite , we have @xmath49 @xmath46 . the hot ionic ( @xmath50 k ) and very hot ionic ( @xmath51 k ) gas components constitute 4%@xmath525% and 0.3%@xmath520.5% by mass of all interstellar gas respectively @xcite , which correspond to @xmath53 @xmath46 and @xmath54 @xmath46 .",
    "the effective photoionization cross sections of h@xmath39 , h , he , hot metal ions and very hot metal ions by 8.7 kev photons are @xmath55 @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath56 , @xmath58 @xmath56 , @xmath59 @xmath56 and @xmath60 @xmath56 respectively @xcite . since the size of a degenerate sterile neutrino halo is very small , we can treat it as a point source . by using eq .",
    "( 2 ) and the above data , we have @xmath61 therefore , the observed 8.7 kev photon flux should be @xmath62 which is consistent with the observational data @xmath63 erg @xmath14 s@xmath2 .    observational data on stars s1 and s2 near the gc constrain @xmath64 to be less than or equal to @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "since in our model the sterile neutrino decays also supply the energy needed for the hard component of the hot gas near the gc , @xmath66 erg s@xmath2 , we have @xmath67 s@xmath2 , which coincides with what is needed to solve the cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , in the low reheating temperature scenario , the number density of active neutrinos is lower and the mixing angle can be much larger than the standard prediction @xcite .",

    "with such a large mixing angle , the sterile - active neutrino oscillation may be visible in future experiments @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the excess 8.7 kev emission observed by the _ suzaku _",
    "x - ray mission as well as the high temperature ( @xmath7 kev ) of the hot gas near the gc can both be accounted for by the existence of a halo of degenerate decaying sterile neutrinos with 17.4 kev rest mass .",
    "the emitted photons from the sterile neutrino halo hiding deeply at the gc heat up the surrounding gas .",
    "the energy is then transferred to the nearby gas clouds to maintain their temperature at around 8 kev .",
    "the calculated photon flux for 8.7 kev photons from the gc is @xmath72 erg @xmath14 s@xmath2 , which is consistent with the observed flux @xmath63 erg @xmath14 s@xmath2 .    in this scenario ,",

    "these values are also consistent with those needed to account for the cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters @xcite and are consistent with the low reheating temperature model @xcite .",
