    "powerful jets and outflows are commonly observed in accreting black hole systems including active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) @xcite . in spite of the availability of wealth of high resolution observations , the physical mechanism of jet generation and its powering processes",
    "are still remain unclear",
    ". however , the obvious cause seems to be the extreme gravity that powers the outflows where spin of the central objects may play an important role in producing the relativistic jets .",
    "earlier work of @xcite demonstrated that infalling particles on to a rotating black hole have the potential to extract some of the rotational energy of the black holes .",
    "close to the horizon , space - time geometry is dragged due to black hole rotation and the magnetic field lines are twisted resulting the transport of energy from the black hole along the field lines .",
    "@xcite showed that this purely electromagnetic energy extraction mechanism via the threading of magnetic field lines has the potential to power the jets .",
    "this appealing mechanism clearly indicates that black hole spin perhaps play an important role to produce jets in black hole systems . in order to establish this feature observationally",
    ", attempts have been made to find the evidence of spin - powered jets for the stellar mass black holes . according to @xcite and @xcite , significant positive correlation between the radio luminosity associated with the mechanical power of ballistic jets and the spin of the black hole",
    "is seen when the transient black hole systems are fed at eddington - limited accretion rates .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite ruled out the direct evidence of any such correlation between the transient jet power and the black hole spin . using radio - optical correlation",
    ", @xcite also reported that the black hole spin possibly does not have any dominant role in powering the jets . in a numerical endeavor",
    ", @xcite claimed that the jet efficiency increases by two orders of magnitude for rapidly rotating black hole compared to the non - spinning black hole . in the similar context , @xcite showed that the more mass is evacuated from the disc as the black hole spin is increased . in an early effort",
    ", @xcite also found that the jet power is strongly dependent on the spin of the black holes without considering the jet geometry .",
    "overall , all the above findings are in contrast and therefore , inconclusive .    meanwhile , some authors pointed out that there exists a confirm connection between the accretion spectral states and the jet states ( i.e. , thick and thin ) in black hole systems , particularly for microquasars @xcite . in the _ low - hard spectral states _ ( _ lhs _ ) of galactic black holes , quasi - steady and persistent jets are observed whereas relatively stronger jets are launched generally in the _ hard - intermediate state _ ( _ hims _ ) .",
    "in addition , transient relativistic ejections are observed during the state transition from _ hard - intermediate _ to _ soft - intermediate state _ ( _ sims _ ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , jet activities are not seen in the _ high - soft states _ ( _ hss _ ) .",
    "it has also been observed that during ejections , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are not observed and energy spectra get softens @xcite .",
    "this is conjectured in a way that the matter is ejected from the inner part of the disc ( i.e. , compton corona equivalently psc ) @xcite . towards this , very recently , @xcite reported the inflow - outflow connection through the observation in _ radio _ and _ x - ray _",
    "bands for the object xte j1859 + 226 and claimed that the fast variation of the ` spectro - temporal ' properties of outbursting gbhs are connected with the disruption of the post - shock disc ( i.e. , psc ) in terms of evacuation of matter in the form of jets @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the qpos are not seen during ` transient ' ejection of jets observed in _",
    "radio_. this result indicates that psc possibly be responsible for the origin of qpos in gbhs @xcite .",
    "when jets are emerged out at the cost of the evacuation / disruption of psc , qpos are missing @xcite .",
    "extensive mhd simulations of accretion disk around rotating black holes also indicate that windy hot materials ( i.e. , corona ) blows away from the inner part of the disc as jets @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite showed that psc modulates quasi - periodically when viscosity parameter is chosen to its critical value and such modulation successfully exhibits quasi - periodic variation of psc as well as the outflow rates .",
    "these scenarios indicate that there seems to be direct correlation between psc and outflow .",
    "based on these correlations , one can conjecture that the disk - jet symbiosis is strongly coupled and advective accreting disc perhaps be responsible for the launching of jets and outflows .",
    "advective accretion flow around the black holes must be transonic in order to satisfy the inner boundary conditions .",
    "inflowing matter experiences a virtual barrier in the vicinity of the black hole due to centrifugal repulsion against gravity . according to the second law of thermodynamics , such a virtual barrier triggers the discontinuous transition of the flow variables in the form of shock wave in order to prefer the high entropy solution when possible @xcite . due to compression",
    ", the shock induced accretion flow produces hot and dense post - shock corona ( psc ) surrounding the black holes which essentially acts as the effective boundary layer of the black holes . during accretion ,",
    "a part of the inflowing matter is deflected by psc which is further driven out in the vertical direction by the excess thermal gradient force across the shock , producing bipolar outflows .",
    "such an appealing mechanism to launch outflow from the vicinity of the black hole has been confirmed through numerical simulations @xcite . in addition , numerous attempts have been made theoretically to calculate the mass outflow rate around black holes .",
    "@xcite calculated the mass outflow rate considering isothermal flow . using both keplerian and sub - keplerian components , @xcite self - consistently estimated mass loss from the disc and found that outflow rate strongly depends on both components . @xcite implemented the energy dissipation across the shock while obtaining the outflow rate and found that possibility of mass loss anti - correlates with the dissipation rate . following the work of @xcite",
    ", several authors @xcite studied the properties of mass outflow rate in terms of inflow parameters considering dissipative accretion flow .",
    "however , all these works were carried out with limitation as spin of the black hole was not considered .",
    "motivating with this , we model the inflow - outflow activity around a rotating black hole . since the psc is induced by the shock transition itself , we self - consistently calculate the properties of shock driven outflows in terms of the inflow parameters and investigate the effect of the black hole spin on it . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the pseudo - kerr potential proposed by @xcite to describe the space time geometry around the black hole .",
    "this potential accurately reproduces the particle trajectories around rotating black holes having spin @xmath8 .",
    "we calculate the global accretion solutions in presence of thermally driven outflows and obtain the parameter spaces spanned by energy and angular momentum of the inflowing matter in terms of the black hole spin .",
    "we observe that the shock induced global inflow - outflow solutions exist for wide range of inflow parameters .",
    "varying the inflow parameters , we estimate the _ maximum mass outflow rate _ ( @xmath9 ) as function of black hole spin ( @xmath2 ) and find that @xmath9 weakly depends on @xmath2 having highest value @xmath10 of the inflow rate for @xmath11 .",
    "further , we calculate the _ unabsorbed _ x - ray flux of several black hole objects using the _ rxte@xmath12 _ satellite archival data and obtain their accretion rates considering the accretion efficiency @xmath13 @xcite , which perhaps reasonable for rotating black holes . with this , using our theoretical estimate of maximum mass outflow rate ,",
    "we then compute the maximum jet kinetic power ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these results are further compared with those available from observations and close agreements are seen . following this",
    ", our theoretical prediction essentially provides an estimate of @xmath14 for those sources for which observed jet power is uncertain .    in the next section",
    ", we describe the basic assumptions and the governing equations for our model . in  3 , we discuss the methodology to calculate the mass outflow rates self - consistently . in  4 , we present the results which is followed by discussions . in  5 , we apply our formalism to calculate the jet kinetic power for several astrophysical objects ( gbhs and agns ) .",
    "finally in  6 , we draw the concluding remarks .",
    "we consider an axisymmetric disc - jet system around a rotating black hole in the steady state . here",
    ", the accretion disc lies along the black hole equatorial plane while the jet geometry is described about the black hole rotation axis . in this work",
    ", we mainly focus on the inner region of the accretion disc , where the viscous time scale is larger than the in - fall time scale and therefore , the angular momentum transport due to the differential motion is weakly significant leaving the flow to be inviscid there @xcite .",
    "further , in our model , jets are originated from the inner part of the accretion disc ( psc ) with the same angular momentum of the disc as we neglect the effect of resulting torque in the disc - jet system .",
    "next , we present the governing equations that describe the fluid properties of the accretion disc and the jets .",
    "all the equations are written in geometric unit system as @xmath15 , where , @xmath16 is the gravitational constant , @xmath17 is the black hole mass and @xmath18 is the speed of light , respectively . in this system ,",
    "the unit of length , mass and time are expressed as @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "we consider a geometrically thin , axisymmetric , low angular momentum , advective accretion flow around a rotating black hole . for simplicity , we adopt the pseudo - kerr effective potential introduced by @xcite to represent the space - time geometry around the black hole instead of using full general relativistic prescription .",
    "this enables us to solve the problem following the newtonian approach and keeping all the salient features of space - time geometry around it .",
    "the equation of motion describing the accreting matter is given by ,    \\(i ) the energy conservation equation :    @xmath21 where , @xmath22 represent the specific energy of the flow , @xmath23 is the radial velocity and @xmath24 is the adiabatic sound speed defined as @xmath25 . here",
    ", @xmath26 is the isotropic pressure , @xmath27 is the gas density , @xmath28 is the adiabatic index , respectively .",
    "the accreting gas is described by the adiabatic equation of state as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the measure of specific entropy , which is constant except at the shock transition .",

    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the redshift factor and @xmath2 represents the black hole rotation parameter defined as the specific spin angular momentum of the black hole . according to @xcite , the above potential mimic the kerr geometry quite satisfactorily for a wide range of @xmath42 .",
    "\\(ii ) the mass conservation equation :    @xmath43 where , @xmath44 denotes the mass accretion rate which is constant everywhere except the region of mass loss and @xmath45 is the half - thickness of the disk obtained from thin disk approximation @xcite as ,    @xmath46 where , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the vertical height in the cylindrical coordinate system and @xmath49 .    combining the expression of sound speed and the adiabatic equation of the state of the gas",
    ", we calculate the entropy accretion rate as @xcite ,    @xmath50 where , @xmath51 = @xmath52 . in an accretion disk ,",
    "@xmath53 remain constant all throughout except at the shock transition where local turbulence generates entropy .",
    "therefore , the entropy accretion rate in the post - shock region is higher than that in the pre - shock region .    by definition , the accretion flow around the black holes must be transonic in nature .",
    "this is due to the fact that the velocity of the accreting matter at large distances from the black hole is negligibly small and therefore , the flow is subsonic .",
    "however , flow crosses the event horizon with velocity equivalent to the speed of light implying that the flow is supersonic close to the black hole .",
    "this clearly indicates that the accretion flow necessarily changes its sonic state during its journey from the outer edge of the disc to the horizon . in order to calculate the location where the state of this sonic transition occurs",
    ", we derive the sonic point conditions using eqs .",

    "since the accretion flow is smooth everywhere , the radial velocity gradient must be finite everywhere too . according to eq .",
    "( 6 ) , if the denominator @xmath57 vanishes at any radial distance , the numerator @xmath58 also vanishes there .",

    ", flow must contain at least one saddle type sonic point ( @xcite and references therein ) . depending on the values of @xmath22 and @xmath1",

    ", we consider the outflow to be emerged out from the accretion disc along the rotation axis of the black hole with the same energy and angular momentum as the accretion flow since we neglect the dissipative processes ( i.e. , viscosity , cooling etc . ) .",
    "similar to accretion flow , we consider the outflow to obey the polytropic equation of state as @xmath65 , where , the suffix ` @xmath66 ' denotes the outflow variables",
    ". the equations of motion that describe the outflow dynamics are given by ,    \\(i ) _ the energy conservation equation of outflow _ :    @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) represent the specific energy of the outflow , @xmath70 is the outflow velocity and @xmath71 is the sound speed of the outflow , respectively .",

    ", we consider the outflow geometry as described in @xcite where the outflowing matter tends to come out through the two surfaces , namely the centrifugal barrier ( cb ) and the funnel wall ( fw ) .",
    "we calculate the centrifugal barrier by identifying the pressure maxima surface as @xmath74 and the funnel wall by defining the null effective potential as @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "as the effective potential of our interest is complex in nature , it is unattainable to prevail an analytical expression of the cb surface and the fw and therefore , we compute them numerically . in figure 1 , we illustrate the outflow geometry around the rotating black holes for a wide range of @xmath2 marked in the figure and compare them with the same obtained using the pseudo - newtonian potential introduced by @xcite appropriate for a stationary black hole .",
    "the regions bounded by the dashed and dotted curves are for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively and the solid curves depict the result of stationary black hole . note that the outflow geometry for stationary as well as for rotating black holes is indistinguishable outside the range of few tens of schwarzschild radius .",
    "this is possibly due to the fact that the effect of black hole spin on the space - time geometry cursorily diminishes with the increasing distances . keeping this in mind",
    ", we therefore adopt the outflow geometry of the stationary black hole for our present study in order to avoid the rigorous numerical calculations .",
    "this enables us to obtain an analytical expression of area function @xmath73 and its higher order derivatives , which is required in the sonic point analysis of outflowing matter @xcite .",

    "when outflow is emerged out from the inner part of the disk ( psc ) , post - shock pressure is decreased that essentially compels the shock front to move forward towards the horizon in order to maintain the pressure balance across the shock . therefore , a flow originally containing shock wave close to its minimum location ( @xmath351 ) for @xmath131 , will not provide any outflow as r - h shock conditions are not favorable there ( see fig .",
    "this certainly tells us that the outflow solutions would be restricted compared to the global shocked accretion solutions in absence of mass loss .",
    "however , we show that the shock induced global inflow - outflow solutions are not isolated solutions , but exist for a wide range of inflow parameters , namely , @xmath128 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , numerical simulations also indicate the similar findings as reported by @xcite .",
    "we examine the existence of such solutions with and without outflow and obtain the parameter space spanned by the @xmath128 and @xmath1 as function of black hole rotation parameter @xmath2 . as anticipated above , the parameter space that provides mass outflow",
    "is shrunk compared to the case of no outflow ( see fig . 7 ) . in other words , a significant region of the parameter space that exhibits stationary shock for",
    "@xmath131 does not provide steady shock solutions in presence of outflow .",
    "this possibly infer that the accreting matter having @xmath128 and @xmath1 from this region of the parameter space may demonstrate the non - steady behavior @xcite which is triggered simply due to the presence of mass loss .",
    "investigation of such scenario requires time - dependent calculations which is beyond the scope of the present work and we wish to report this elsewhere .    in this work",
    ", we mainly focused on thermally ultra - relativistic flows with adiabatic index @xmath157 .",
    "however , when the cooling effects are negligible , the purely non - relativistic flow behaves like gas - pressure dominated with @xmath352 . in reality",
    ", the value of @xmath28 would be an intermediate value depending on the dissipation processes active in the flow . keeping this in mind",
    ", we calculate the parameter space for different values of @xmath28 and find that shock forms in all the cases even in presence of outflow .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the effective region of the parameter space is reduced with the increase of @xmath28 indicating the limited possibility of shock transition when the flow changes its character towards the non - relativistic regime .    we have estimated the mass outflow rate using the inflow parameters , such as , @xmath128 and @xmath1 .",
    "we show that @xmath3 increases with @xmath2 for a fixed @xmath128 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "this is possibly due to the fact that as @xmath2 is increased shock forms away from the black hole . therefore , the effective area of the post - shock flow ( psc ) , where the inflowing matter deflects to generate outflow , becomes large and results enhanced outflow rate .",
    "further , we attempt to find the maximum mass loss ( @xmath9 ) from the disc and quantify it in terms of the inflow parameters . for this",
    ", we fix the value of @xmath28 and explore all possible combinations of energy and angular momentum to obtain @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "9 , we show the variation of @xmath9 with @xmath2 and observe that flow with @xmath11 exhibits the highest outflow rate @xmath9 that lies in the range around @xmath10 .",
    "also , very weak correlation is seen between @xmath9 and @xmath2 in all the cases .",
    "moreover , we have shown in fig .",
    "10 that for various sets of ( @xmath353 ) , @xmath3 increases with the decrease of @xmath110 ( equivalently jet power increases as the size of the psc is reduced ) based on the realistic scenario ( i.e. , spectral states transit from _ lhs _ to _ hims _ ) which seems to be a common characteristic observed in gbh sources .",
    "we employ our formalism in order to estimate the jet kinetic power ( @xmath179 ) of several black hole sources ( gbhs and agns ) . to begin with ,",
    "we consider outbursting sources to calculate @xmath179 based on the accretion states .",
    "for these sources , we compute their _ unabsorbed _ x - ray fluxes in _ lhs _ and _ hims _ using the data of _ rxte _ observation and obtain their disc rate considering the accretion efficiency @xmath242 which seems to be relevant for rotating black holes .",
    "then , we calculate the outflow rate using our formalism and employ it in eq .",
    "( 15 ) along with the disc rate to obtain @xmath179 . while estimating the jet kinetic power , we consider maximum outflow rate @xmath9 for _ hims _ ( see fig .",
    "9 ) and @xmath354 for _ lhs _ , as discussed in section 5 . in table 1",
    ", we summarize the physical parameters of five black hole sources along with the computed jet kinetic power . in the process of estimating @xmath14 , two quantities",
    "play major role .",
    "first one is the unabsorbed x - ray flux computed from _ rxte _",
    "archival data and the other is the maximum outflow rate obtained from our model calculation .",
    "we find that the estimated @xmath14 for various sources are in close agreement with the observed values @xcite .",
    "we further extend our study for other black hole sources where the fast accretion state transitions ( @xmath347 day scale ) are not seen ( except xte j1550 - 564 ) .",
    "for these sources , the disc rate is obtained from the existing literature ( see table 2 ) and @xmath9 is computed from our theoretical calculation which finally provides the @xmath14 .",
    "we present these results in table 2 .",
    "we notice that estimated @xmath14 for cyg x-1 , xte j1550 - 564 , m87 and sgr a * are also in close agreement with the observed values @xcite . following this findings",
    ", we argue that @xmath14 for rest of the sources would also in turn render the representative values which are expected to be consistent with their actual estimates .",
    "the present work has limitations as it is developed based on some approximations .",
    "we use pseudo - kerr gravitational potential to mimic the general relativistic effect around rotating black hole that allows us to examine the properties of non - linear shock solutions in presence of mass loss in a simpler way .",
    "we ignore the effect of viscosity and radiative processes .",
    "we consider constant adiabatic index instead of calculating it self - consistently based on its thermal properties .",
    "needless to mention that we have not address the issue of transient relativistic ejections and its collimation mechanism as we consider the jet geometry only up to its sonic point .",
    "although the implementation of all such issues are beyond the scope of this paper , however , we believe that the above approximations will not alter our basic conclusions qualitatively .",
