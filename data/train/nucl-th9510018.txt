    "models have been widely used to study the properties of the hadron spectrum due to the impossibility to solve quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at the current moment . in particular , the quark potential models incorporate the perturbative one - gluon exchange quark - quark ( @xmath1 ) potential ( @xmath2 ) derived from qcd as well as a parametrization of some nonperturbative effects through a @xmath1 confining potential ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . such an _ effective theory _",
    "[ the quark - gluon coupling constant is taken as an effective one and the constituent quark masses ( @xmath4 ) are parameters fitted from the baryon magnetic moments ] provides a reasonable understanding of the baryon spectrum and the hadron static properties @xcite .    the idea of an interquark potential has been also used to study baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "more explicitly , the repulsive core of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force has been shown to arise from the color - spin structure of the @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the same scheme has been proven incapable of describing the long range part of the nn interaction unless pion exchange between quarks is introduced . from the basic theory ,",
    "the origin of the one - pion exchange potential ( @xmath5 ) is associated with the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd . moreover",
    ", the inclusion of the @xmath1 sigma potential ( @xmath6 ) consistently with its chiral partner ( the pion ) allows to reproduce the intermediate range @xmath7 interaction as well as the deuteron properties @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the consistency of the two scenarios .",
    "we determine a @xmath1 interaction by studying two nucleon properties and charge exchange reactions and proceed to analyze the baryon spectrum for this interaction .",
    "as we shall discuss the predictions for the baryon masses and the baryon wave functions , it is not only a stringent test of the potential but also a consistency test of the formalism used to generate the nn interaction [ resonating group method ( rgm ) ] .",
    "the starting point of our description is a quark - quark interaction of the following form :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the interquark distance .",
    "the confinement is chosen to be linear as suggested by the meson spectrum and lattice calculations :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the su(3 ) color matrices .",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 have been derived in detail elsewhere @xcite and we shall limit here to write the final expressions :    @xmath12 \\,\\ , { { e^{-r_{ij}/r_0 } } \\over { r_0 ^ 2 \\,\\,r_{ij } } } - { 1 \\over { 4 m^2_q \\ , r^3_{ij } } } \\ , s_{ij } \\biggr \\rbrace \\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the effective quark - quark - gluon coupling constant , @xmath14 is the range of a smeared @xmath15 function in order to avoid and unbound spectrum @xcite , the @xmath16 stand for the spin pauli matrices and @xmath17 is the quark tensor operator @xmath18 .",

    "to study the baryonic spectrum with the potential just described ( parameters as in table [ param ] ) we solve the schrdinger equation in the hyperspherical harmonic approach @xcite .",
    "the low energy @xmath30 and @xmath0 spectrum obtained , a part of which is shown in fig . [ espe ] , is quite reasonable though some small discrepancy remains concerning the relative energy position of the roper resonance [ @xmath31 and the first negative parity state excitation [ @xmath32 , as it is common in two body potential models .",
    "regarding the wave function and in order to check the internal rgm consistency , it makes sense to compare the @xmath7 potential one obtains from the wave function solution of the schrdinger equation , with the potential obtained from the ansatz rgm wave function for different values of the parameter @xmath29 . for the sake of technical simplicity",
    "we do this in the born - oppeheimer approximation .",
