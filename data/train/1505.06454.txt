    "the beauty coefficient value @xmath3 for a given paper is based on the comparison between its citation history and a reference line that is determined only by its publication year , the maximum number of citations received in a year ( within a multi - year observation period ) , and the year when such maximum is achieved .",
    "given a paper , let us define @xmath4 as the number of citations received in the @xmath5-th year after its publication ; @xmath5 indicates the age of the paper .",

    "we now give a plausible definition of awakening time  the year when the abrupt change in the accumulation of citations of sbs occurs .",
    "being able to pinpoint the awakening time may help identifying possible general trigger mechanisms behind said change .",

    "we define the awakening time @xmath26 as the time @xmath5 at which the distance @xmath29 between the point @xmath30 and the reference line @xmath9 reaches its maximum : @xmath31 where @xmath29 is given by @xmath32    as we shall show , the above definition works well for limit cases where there are no citations until the spike , and seems to well capture the qualitative notion of awakening time when a strong sb - like behavior is present .",
    "we use two datasets in the following empirical analysis , the american physical society ( aps ) and the web of science ( wos ) dataset ( si appendix , section  s1 ) .",
    "the aps journals are the major publication outlets in physics .",
    "wos includes papers in both sciences and social sciences .",
    "we focus on the @xmath33 papers in the aps and @xmath34 papers in the wos that received at least one citation .",
    "those papers span more than a century , and thus allow us to investigate the sb phenomenon for a long observation period .",
    "whereas the aps dataset can be viewed as a perfect proxy to characterize citation dynamics within the monodisciplinary research field of physics and is used to compare our analysis with a previous study  @xcite , the wos dataset allows us to underpin multidisciplinary features of the sb phenomenon .",
    "first , we qualitatively demonstrate the resolution power of @xmath3 for four papers with radically different citation trajectories . fig .",
    "[ fig : beauty - diff]_a _ shows a paper with a very high @xmath3 value . published in 1951 ,",

    "our results are in excellent agreement with redner s analysis  @xcite : 6 out 12 of the revived classics detected by redner are in our top 10 list ; the other 6 have also very high @xmath3 values , although they occupy less important positions in the ranking according to @xmath3 ( si appendix , table  s1 ) .",
    "differences are due to the principles underlying the two approaches , with ours not relying on threshold parameters for the sleeping time and the number of citations . to better clarify the diversity of the two approaches , si appendix , figs .",
    "s2 and  s3 report the citation history of the @xmath43 papers with highest @xmath3 values in the aps dataset .",
    "we see that our measure identifies papers with a long hibernation period followed by a sudden burst in yearly citations , without the need to reach extremely high values of citations .",
    "as already pointed out by redner  @xcite , the list of top sbs in the aps reveals a natural grouping into a relatively small number of coarse topics , with papers belonging to the same topic exhibiting remarkably similar citation histories ( si appendix , fig .",
    "this suggests that a `` premature '' topic may fail to attract the community attention even when it is introduced by authors who have already established a strong scientific reputation . a corroborating evidence is provided by the famous epr paradox paper by einstein , podolsky , and rosen that is among the top sbs we found in this dataset ( si appendix , fig .",
    "s2__b _ _ ) .",
    "in contrast with previous sb definitions  @xcite , ours does not rely on the arbitrary choice of age or citation thresholds .",
    "this fact puts us in the unique position of investigating the sb phenomenon at the systemic level and asking fundamental questions from the macroscopic point of view : are papers with extreme values of @xmath3 exceptional occurrences ?",
    "do the majority of papers behave in a qualitatively different way from the extreme cases discussed above , when their sleeping period and bursty awakening are considered ?    to this end , we provide a statistical description of the distribution of beauty coefficients across all papers in each of the two datasets .",
    "[ fig : beauty - ccdf ] shows the survival distribution functions of @xmath3 for all papers in the aps and wos datasets .",
    "we observe a heterogeneous but continuous distribution of @xmath3 , spanning several orders of magnitude . except for the cutoff  which is much larger for the wos dataset  aps and wos exhibit remarkably similar distributions .",
    "although the vast majority of papers exhibit low values of @xmath3 , there is a consistent number of papers with high @xmath3 .",
    "the distributions also show no typical value or mode ; there are no clear demarcation values that allow us to separate sbs from `` normal '' papers : delayed recognition occurs on a wide and continuous range , in sharp contrast with previous results claiming that sbs are extraordinary cases  @xcite .",
    "survival distribution functions of beauty coefficients . on the horizontal axis ,",
    "we shift the values by @xmath44 ( i.e. , the minimal value of @xmath3 is @xmath45 ) to make all points visible in the logarithmic scale .",
    "the blue and cyan curves represent the empirical results obtained on the aps and wos datasets , respectively .",
    "results obtained with the nr and pa model are plotted as green and magenta lines , respectively .",
    "the red dashed line stands for the best estimate of a power - law fit of the aps curve : exponent @xmath46 and the minimum value of the range of the fit @xmath47 are estimated using the statistical methods developed by clauset et  al .",
    "@xcite . in the aps and wos , @xmath48 and @xmath49 of papers ,",
    "respectively , have negative @xmath3 values . ]",
    "it may appear as not entirely fair to compare beauty coefficients for papers of different ages  @xcite : later papers have by definition less chance to develop a long sleeping period and to exhibit a sudden awakening .",
    "this may , to some extent , dictate the shapes of observed distributions . on the other hand , the vast majority of papers tend to have a single and well - defined peak in their yearly citations early during their lifetime , implying that their @xmath3 values do not change with moving the observation time @xmath50 far into the future .",
    "in particular , our estimations indicate that nearly @xmath51 of the papers have already experienced a drastic decrement after their maximum number of yearly citations , irrespective of their @xmath3 value ( si appendix , section  s3 ) .",
    "the shapes of the empirical distributions remain essentially unchanged if we consider only the papers that have experienced the typical sharp decline of the post - maximum yearly citation rate .",
    "the result of the previous section implicitly suggests that the sb phenomenon could be in principle described via a simple mechanism that works essentially at all scales .",
    "this leads naturally to the question whether the observed distributions of @xmath3 can be accounted for by idealized network evolution models . to address this question ,",
    "we first consider a citation network randomization ( nr ) process where citations are randomly reshuffled , preserving time order ( si appendix , section  s4 ) .",
    "si appendix , fig .",
    "s2 compares the citation history of the top nine sbs in the aps dataset and the corresponding ones obtained through the nr process .",
    "they typically show opposite trends , with nr histories exhibiting a rapid decline .",
    "this is not surprising : as later papers are considered , the probability for an existing paper to receive a citation from one of such late papers decreases simply because there is a larger number of papers that could potentially receive the citation .",
    "this leads to typically smaller beauty coefficients , as evident in the sharp decrease of the nr distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : beauty - ccdf ] , and the associated small maximum value @xmath52 .",
    "next , we consider the preferential attachment ( pa ) mechanism as another baseline model , as it is one of the most fundamental ingredients used in most modeling efforts aimed at describing citation histories of papers . in the pa baseline , references of",
    "progressively added citing papers are reassigned according to the pa mechanism ( si appendix , section  s4 ) .",
    "si appendix , fig .",
    "s2 also shows slowly increasing yearly citations by the pa model , explained by the positive feedback effect generated via the pa mechanism . the overall number of citations according to pa baseline for the nine papers in si appendix , fig .",
    "s2 remains small .",
    "those are relatively young papers in the dataset and their probability to receive citations , according to pa , is reduced by that of older papers .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : beauty - ccdf ] shows a much smaller range and a well - defined cutoff .",
    "it remains to be seen to what extent a recently proposed model for citation histories  @xcite are compatible with the sb phenomenon .",
    "the occurrence of extreme cases of sbs is not limited to physics .",
    "table  [ tab : beauty - wos ] lists basic information about the @xmath53 papers with the highest @xmath3 values in the wos dataset ( see si appendix , fig .",
    "s4 for their citation histories ) .",
    "this list contains four sbs that were published in the 1900s .",
    "consistent with previous studies , we find that many sbs are in the field of physics and chemistry  @xcite .",
    "two papers are , however , in the field of statistics , which fails to be noted before as a top discipline producing sbs .",
    "one of them slept for more than one century : the paper by the influential statistician karl pearson , published in @xmath54 in the journal _ philosophical magazine _ , shows the relation between principal component analysis and the minimization chi - distance .",

    "<S> a sleeping beauty ( sb ) in science refers to a paper whose importance is not recognized for several years after publication . </S>",
    "<S> its citation history exhibits a long hibernation period followed by a sudden spike of popularity . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies suggest a relative scarcity of sbs . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of this conclusion is , however , heavily dependent on identification methods based on arbitrary threshold parameters for sleeping time and number of citations , applied to small or monodisciplinary bibliographic datasets . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a systematic , large - scale , and multidisciplinary analysis of the sb phenomenon in science . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a parameter - free measure that quantifies the extent to which a specific paper can be considered an sb . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our method to 22 million scientific papers published in all disciplines of natural and social sciences over a time span longer than a century . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that the sb phenomenon is not exceptional . </S>",
    "<S> there is a continuous spectrum of delayed recognition where both the hibernation period and the awakening intensity are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> although many cases of sbs can be identified by looking at monodisciplinary bibliographic data , the sb phenomenon becomes much more apparent with the analysis of multidisciplinary datasets , where we can observe many examples of papers achieving delayed yet exceptional importance in disciplines different from those where they were originally published . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis emphasizes a complex feature of citation dynamics that so far has received little attention , and also provides empirical evidence against the use of short - term citation metrics in the quantification of scientific impact .    </S>",
    "<S> * significance*scientific papers have typically a finite lifetime : their rate to attract citations achieves its maximum a few years after publication , and then steadily declines . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies pointed out the existence of a few blatant exceptions : papers whose relevance has not been recognized for decades , but then suddenly become highly influential and cited . </S>",
    "<S> the einstein , podolsky , and rosen `` paradox '' paper is an exemplar sleeping beauty . </S>",
    "<S> we study how common sleeping beauties are in science . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a quantity that captures both the recognition intensity and the duration of the `` sleeping '' period , and show that sleeping beauties are far from exceptional . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of such quantity is continuous and has power - law behavior , suggesting a common mechanism behind delayed but intense recognition at all scales .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an increasing interest in understanding the dynamics underlying scientific production and the evolution of science  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> seminal studies focused on scientific collaboration networks  @xcite , evolution of disciplines  @xcite , team science  @xcite , and citation - based scientific impact  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important issue at the core of many research efforts in science of science is characterizing how papers attract citations during their lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> citations can be regarded as the credit units that the scientific community attributes to its research products . as such , they are at the basis of several quantitative measures aimed at evaluating career trajectories of scholars  @xcite and research performance of institutions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are also increasingly used as evaluation criteria in very important contexts , such as hiring , promotion , and tenure , funding decisions , or department and university rankings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several factors can potentially affect the amount of citations accumulated by a paper over time , including its quality , timeliness , and potential to trigger further inquiries  @xcite , the reputation of its authors  @xcite , as well as its topic and age  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> studies about fundamental mechanisms that drive citation dynamics started already in the 1960s , when de  solla  price introduced the cumulative advantage ( ca ) model to explain the emergence of power - law citation distributions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ca essentially provisions that the probability of a publication to attract a new citation is proportional to the number of citations it already has . the criterion , </S>",
    "<S> now widely referred to as preferential attachment , was recently popularized by barabsi and albert  @xcite , who proposed it as a general mechanism that yields heterogeneous connectivity patterns in networks describing systems in various domains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other processes that effectively incorporate the ca mechanism have been proposed to explain power - law citation distributions . </S>",
    "<S> krapivsky and redner , for example , considered a redirection mechanism , where new papers copy with a certain probability the citations of other papers  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important effect not included in the ca mechanism is the fact that the probability of receiving citations is time dependent . in the ca model , papers continue to acquire citations independently of their age so that , on average , older papers accumulate higher number of citations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been empirically observed that the rate at which a paper accumulates citations decreases after an initial growth period  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies about growing network models include the aging of nodes as a key feature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , wang et  al . developed a model that includes , in addition to the ca and aging , an intuitive yet fundamental ingredient : a fitness or quality parameter that accounts for the perceived novelty and importance of individual papers  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we focus on the citation history of papers receiving an intense but late recognition . </S>",
    "<S> note that delayed recognition can not be predicted by current models for citation dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> all models , regardless of the number of ingredients used , naturally lead to the so - called first - mover advantage , according to which either papers start to accumulate citations in the early stages of their lifetime or they will never be able to accumulate a significant number of citations  @xcite . back in the 1980s , </S>",
    "<S> garfield provided examples of articles with delayed recognition and suggested to use citation data to identify them  @xcite . through a broad literature search , </S>",
    "<S> glnzel et al . gave an estimate for the occurrence of delayed recognition , and highlighted a few shared features among lately recognized papers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coinage of the term  sleeping beauty \" ( sb ) in reference to papers with delayed recognition is due to van  raan  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he proposed three dimensions along which delayed recognition can be measured : ( _ i _ ) length of sleep , i.e. , the duration of the `` sleeping period ; '' ( _ ii _ ) depth of sleep , i.e. , the average number of citations during the sleeping period ; and ( _ iii _ ) awake intensity , i.e. , the number of citations accumulated during 4 years after the sleeping period . by combining these measures , he identified a few sb examples occurred between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these seminal studies suffer from two main limitations : ( _ i _ ) the analyzed datasets are very small , especially if compared to the size of the bibliographic databases currently available ; and ( _ ii _ ) the definition and the consequent identification of sbs are to the same extent arbitrary , and strongly depend on the rules adopted . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , redner analyzed a very large dataset covering @xmath2 years of publications in physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> redner proposed a definition of revived classic ( or sb ) for articles satisfying the three following criteria : ( _ i _ ) publication date antecedent 1961 ; ( _ ii _ ) number of citations larger than 250 ; and ( _ iii _ ) ratio of the average citation age to publication age greater than 0.7 . whereas redner was able to overcome the first limitation mentioned above , his study is still affected by an arbitrary selection choice of top sbs , justified by the principle that sbs represent exceptional events in science . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , redner s analysis has the limitation to be field specific , covering only publications and citations within the realm of physics .    </S>",
    "<S> here we perform an analysis on the sb phenomenon in science . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a parameter - free approach to quantify how much a given paper can be considered as an sb . </S>",
    "<S> we call this index  beauty coefficient , \" denoted as @xmath3 . by measuring @xmath3 for tens of millions of publications in multiple scientific disciplines over an observation window longer than a century , </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath3 is characterized by a heterogeneous but continuous distribution , with no natural separation between papers with low , high , or even extreme values of @xmath3 . also , we demonstrate that the empirical distributions of @xmath3 can not be easily reconciled with obvious baseline models for citation accumulation that are based solely on ca or the reshuffling of citations . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a simple method to identify the awakening time of sbs , i.e. , the year when their citations burst . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that many sbs become highly influential more than 50 years after their publication , far longer than typical time windows for measuring citation impact , corroborating recent studies on understanding the use of short time windows to approximate long - term citations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the majority of papers exhibit a sudden decay of popularity after reaching the maximum number of yearly citations , independently of their @xmath3 values . </S>",
    "<S> our study points out that the sb phenomenon has two important multidisciplinary components . </S>",
    "<S> first , particular disciplines , such as physics , chemistry , and mathematics , are able to produce top sbs at higher rates than other scientific fields . </S>",
    "<S> second , top sbs achieve delayed exceptional importance in disciplines different from those where they were originally published . based on these results </S>",
    "<S> , we believe that our study may pave the way to the identification of the complex dynamics that trigger the awakening mechanisms , shedding light on highly cited papers that follow nontraditional popularity trajectories . </S>"
