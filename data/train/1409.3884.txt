    "the quantum stochastic calculus was introduced by hudson and parthasarathy @xcite in 1984 as a framework to construct explicit dilations of quantum dynamical evolutions ( semigroups of completely positive norm - continuous identity preserving maps ) generalizing the usual it theory . here",
    "the system hilbert space is tensored with a fock space over @xmath0 where @xmath1 enumerates the number of input noise channels . in particular",
    ", they showed that the most general form of a quantum unitary stationary evolution was obtained as the solution to an it quantum stochastic differential equation of the form @xmath2 ( implied sum of repeated indices over the range @xmath3 ) with @xmath4 $ ] unitary on @xmath5 , @xmath6 $ ] arbitrary , and @xmath7 self - adjoint .",
    "these type of models are commonly referred to as following the @xmath8 formalism , see section [ sec : qsde ] for details .",
    "it was quickly realized @xcite that the quantum evolutions could in fact be interpreted as a singular perturbation of the free dynamics corresponding to the second quantization of the shift along @xmath0 . in particular",
    ", one could take the line @xmath9 to physically be an infinite transmission line along which bose quanta are propagating at constant speed , and interacting with the system ( located at the origin ) instantaneously as they pass through .",
    "it was a long standing program to find the form of the associated hamiltonian , which when viewed in the interaction picture with respect to the free shift dynamics , gave the general quantum open dynamics , as well as a large class of classical stochastic models .",
    "this was first done by chebotarev @xcite for the case of commuting coupling coefficients , and by gregoratti @xcite for the general bounded operator case .",
    "the requirement of boundedness was later dropped @xcite .",
    "the domain of the hamiltonian is determined through a boundary condition at the origin on the vectors .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian , @xmath10 , obtained in @xcite and @xcite is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian corresponding to free propagation of the external noise field ( basically its the generator of translation , that is , the second quantisation of the momentum operator with the origin removed ) , and @xmath13 is taken to belong to a domain of suitable functions satisfying the boundary condition @xmath14 with the suitable functions in question being those on the joint system and fock space that are in the domain of the free translation along the positive and negative axis ( excluding the vertex at the origin ) , and in the domain of the one - sided annihilators @xmath15 .",
    "the expression for the associated hamiltonian looks strange because it is asymmetric in the formal creation and annihilation operator densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and this makes the interpretation non - obvious for physicists .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to show that there is a symmetric form of the hamiltonian which is explicitly symmetric , and which is equivalent to the form ( [ eq : greg_ham ] ) once the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc ] ) is taken into account .",
    "we remark that a similar approach has been pioneered by von waldenfels @xcite which also exploits a quantum white noise formulation , the corresponding kernel calculus ( that is , a bose version of the berezin calculus due to maassen ) , and an explicit construction of deficiency spaces needed to then construct the self - adjoint hamiltonian .",
    "in particular he succeeds in calculating the resolvent of the hamiltonian .",
    "the approach outlined in this note is however more concise",
    ".    we shall refer to this situation of a single system interacting in a singular ( = markov ) fashion with a quantum field moving along a transmission line as a _ local _",
    "hamiltonian model .",
    "more generally we can consider several systems at various points on the transmission line , or more generally a network of transmission lines with systems at the vertices .",
    "the theory of quantum feedback networks has been developed recently to study such quantum mechanical systems connected by various arrangements of quantum field inputs @xcite . here",
    "the notion of a _",
    "hamiltonian was introduced in @xcite in order to construct tractable models of a quantum feedback network .",
    "for a single component , this reduces to the hamiltonian obtained by chebotarev @xcite and gregoratti @xcite , and we present a simple derivation of this object in section [ sec : singpert ] below .",
    "the network theory has been applied to quantum optics with a view to developing closed - loop quantum control systems @xcite- @xcite .",
    "the separate components are modeled as quantum open systems @xcite , see also @xcite , or equivalently as quantum input - output systems @xcite . in a network , connections are made by feeding the output of one system in as input to another , or even to the same component again . in a physically realistic model , this will involve time - lags , however it often useful to take the limit of instantaneous connections .",
    "moreover the components themselves are assumed to be capable of scattering inputs , in particular acting as beam - splitters .    the has been interest amongst theoreticians in recent years in using solid - state devices as in place of optical fields @xcite-@xcite . in suitable regimes",
    "the models resemble the optical case with the obvious exception that the fields are now fermionic rather than bosonic . in section [ sec : fermi ]",
    ", we give the fermi analogue and show that the global hamiltonian method applies equally well to this situation .",
    "indeed , provided the various coupling terms meet the physical conditions regarding fermionic parity , the essential rules governing the construction of networks ( the series product @xcite , the concatenation rule and feedback reduction rule @xcite ) are identical to the bose input case .",
    "the outline of this paper is that we first review the background theory of open quantum systems adopting a quantum white noise convention .",
    "we make some tentative links with the theory of singular perturbations of unbounded below hamiltonians ( which is of relevance to the free hamiltonian generating the shift ) . in section [ sec : singpert ] we give an alternative rationale behind the form of the associated local hamiltonian , and outline how this may be generalized to the case of a global hamiltonian for a quantum feedback network . in section [ sec",
    ": fermi ] , we treat the extension to fermi noise models , and indicate that the formal expressions should be the same as the bose case provided that the coefficients have specific parity with respect to the @xmath18-grading of fermi fock space .",
    "finally in section [ sec : network ] we indicate how , in the limit of zero time delay in a network edge , we obtain a modular reduction in the models .",

    "@xmath43 is not densely defined , however , we will have a singular perturbation .",
    "in this case , @xmath37 will always be strongly continuous , but not generally strongly differentiable .      to understand better ,",
    "let us consider some examples of a quantum system with a fixed hilbert space @xmath44 of states , driven by classical noise .",
    "for instance , let @xmath37 be given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a wiener process and @xmath47 is a self - adjoint operator .",
    "we have the it rule that @xmath48 , so that the stochastic differential equation satisfied by @xmath22 is @xmath49 it is clear from the fact that @xmath37 solves a stochastic differential equation and as such will not be strongly differentiable .    to see how this fits in to our discussions on perturbations ,",
    "let us recall that the wiener process is correctly defined on the sample space @xmath50 of continuous paths parameterised by a continuous variable @xmath51 starting at the origin at time @xmath52 .",
    "the set of measurable subsets of paths are the cylinder sets , and a probability measure on these subsets of paths is given by wiener measure @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be a wiener path , then @xmath55 is the evaluation @xmath56 - the coordinate of the path at time @xmath57 ! we then set @xmath58 as the evaluation of the random variable @xmath37 when the outcome is a particular path @xmath59 .",
    "we may now view the model as being on the total hilbert space @xmath60 where the system is now coupled to an environment whose hilbert space is @xmath61 as is well - known @xmath62 is isomorphic to bose fock space over @xmath63 : in other words , the hilbert space on which we define a single quantum input process . in effect , we may think of @xmath46 as the quadrature of a quantum field in the quantum input theory .",
    "we now introduce the time - shift @xmath64 on the classical wiener probability space as @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",

    ". the corresponding master equation may be obtained by averaging over all poisson paths and this corresponds to @xmath79      to see why this result is astonishing , let us consider a purely classical problem of a particle with position @xmath80 moving in a deterministic vector field @xmath81 , but subject to classical wiener noise .",

    "the somewhat surprising conclusion is that every classical diffusion process ( or jump process , and by extension any process driven by independent increment processes ) can be obtained as the interaction picture evolution of a commuting set of position observables arising as a singular perturbation .",
    "as we have mentioned , quantum stochastic evolutions were introduced in @xcite , and physical models describing quantum optics systems driven by quantum input processes @xmath93 were independently given by @xcite .",
