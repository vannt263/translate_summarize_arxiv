    "in earlier work , we showed that pn molecules can adopt various structures on cu(111 ) depending on their molecular density on the surface  @xcite .",
    "the pn molecules in these structures adsorb with the central benzene ring atop hcp hollow sites in the cu(111 ) surface @xcite and oriented in a planar fashion along a cu close - packed direction .",
    "the two structures of particular interest here are the highly - ordered and dense herringbone ( @xmath7 ) pn ( 0.048 pn molecules per surface cu atom ) and the lower - density random - tiling ( @xmath1 ) pn ( 0.034 pn molecules per surface cu atom ) .",
    "c@xmath0 adsorption on @xmath7-phase pn results in a two - layered mostly disordered heterostructure ( shown in supplemental information ) , with small domains of at most 10 fullerene molecules occupying sites consistent with the underlying cu(111)(6 3 , 0 7)2pn structure .",
    "when the bimolecular film was provided more space to reorganize by depositing c@xmath0 atop the slightly lower - density @xmath1-phase pn , a very different set of structures emerges .",
    "an stm topograph of this film is reproduced in [ sparser ] ( a ) .",
    "a hexagonal domain is clearly visible in which c@xmath0 molecules are separated by @xmath83  nm and spaced by repeating patterns of pn molecules .",
    "the sparser @xmath1-phase pn layer has been observed to permit tip - induced motion for molecules located in sites with adjacent vacancies @xcite .",
    "the greater interaction strength between cu and c@xmath0 appears to drive a reorganization of the heterolayer resulting in the formation of these c@xmath0 - 6pn heptamer ` pinwheels ' .",
    "while the c@xmath0 molecules in [ sparser ] ( a ) appear @xmath82  nm across and thus occlude much of the pn between them , the raised ends of the visible pn molecules are arranged in a chiral fashion as indicated in the inset of [ sparser ] ( a ) , suggesting that the structure itself is chiral .",
    "the images have been combined with previous observations of the various packings of pn molecules @xcite on the cu(111 ) surface to determine a unique structure , which is shown schematically with the underlying cu(111 ) in [ sparser ] ( b ) .",
    "we arrive at this structure by allowing each molecule to adopt a previously observed preferred nucleation site , which for pn has the molecule oriented with the long axis along a close - packed cu @xmath9 $ ] direction and for both molecules has the molecule center above an hcp hollow site with a @xmath10-plane atom beneath @xcite .",
    "each pinwheel consists of a central c@xmath0 molecule surrounded by six pn molecules .",
    "this structure naturally results in reasonable separations for pn molecules , with the overall pn distribution separable into few - molecule domains of the @xmath7-phase structure in 3 orientations . in [ sparser ] ( c ) , we compare the experimental data with a version of the model plotted with representations of the molecules as they appear under stm , i.e. a large sphere for fullerene and a dumb - bell shape for pentacene .",
    "this simple model shows a good agreement with the detail from the experimental data , plotted alongside .",
    "each individual pinwheel heptamer in [ sparser ] ( b ) is _ chiral _ ; blue circles indicate right - handed ( rh ) pinwheels where the pns are canted in the counter - clockwise direction , and green circles indicate left - handed ( lh ) pinwheels where the pns are canted in the clockwise direction .",
    "the unit cell of this superstructure consists of 1 right - handed ( rh ) pinwheel and 2 left - handed ( lh ) pinwheels , leading to an overall rh chirality in this kind of structure .",
    "the matrix notation for the structure in [ sparser ] ( c ) is cu(111)(16 -7 , 23 16)18pn+3c@xmath0 .",
    "the notation for the opposite chirality ( a structure with twice the number of rh pinwheels as lh ) is cu(111)(-7 16 , 16 23)18pn+3c@xmath0 . based on the lattice parameter for cu ( 0.3615 nm ) and",
    "thus the nearest neighbor distance for cu(111 ) ( cu@xmath11 nm ) , expected lattice parameters for these structures are calculated and compared with measured lattice parameters in [ table ] .",
    "the density of pn molecules in this structure is 0.043 per surface cu atom , which is significantly higher than that observed in @xmath1-phase pn despite the additional c@xmath0 molecules and approaches the density of @xmath7-phase pn , which is 0.047 .",
    "the total molecular density is 0.050 molecules per surface cu atom .",
    "if opposite ends of pn molecules can be on separate pinwheels , it should be possible to form domains with a smaller unit cell based on a pinwheels of a _ single _ chirality .",
    "indeed , single chirality domains were formed and identified on the cu(111 ) surface as shown by the images in [ sqfigchi ] .",
    "the two columns of the figure each depict domains comprising a single pinwheel chirality in which pn molecules are shared between adjacent c@xmath0 molecules ; [ sqfigchi ] ( a ) and ( c ) show the image and structure of the lh domains ( unit cell cu(111)(6 -4 , 4 10)3pn+c@xmath0 ) , where the pns are canted in the clockwise direction , while [ sqfigchi ] ( b ) and ( d ) show the image and structure of the rh domains ( unit cell cu(111)(4 -6 , 10 4)3pn+c@xmath0 ) , where the pns are canted in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "our measurements show that these single chirality domains may grow to a much larger size and contain 100s of chiral heterostructures ; 50  nm domains were observed in our data , as shown in [ angles ] .",
    "[ table ] shows the predicted and measured lattice parameters and relative orientations of different chiral domains ; the agreement is extremely good .",
    "the predicted lattice parameters for these structures were calculated , as before , by reference to the cu surface nearest neighbor distance .",
    "the density of pn molecules in this structure is 0.0415 per surface cu atom , and the total molecular density is 0.055 per surface cu atom .",
    "the orientation of individual c@xmath0 molecules at the centers of the pinwheels is determined by mapping their molecular orbitals through differential conductance measurements@xcite , as shown in [ sqfigchi ] ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "these images were recorded with a bias voltage of 1.2  v ( and tunneling current of 0.5  na ) , and are thus sensitive to the lumo+1 molecular orbital .",
    "the maps show the unique orientation of the c@xmath0 molecules on the cu(111 ) surface , by showing the pronounced three - fold character of the lumo+1 orbital , where each lobe is associated with a pentagonal facet surrounding the upmost hexagonal facet @xcite .",
    "we therefore determine that the pentagonal face of the c@xmath0 is oriented along a close - packed direction on the fcc surface , independent of the pinwheel chirality .",
    "100 nm stm topograph ( @xmath12 v , @xmath13 na ) of c@xmath0/pn / cu(111 ) , showing some hexagonal domains of both chiralities .",
    "one domain is colored green and one red to correspond to the components of the fourier transform in * ( b ) * ; fourier transforms of the domains indicated in _ ( a ) _ , showing the angle between equivalent axes of the different domains to be @xmath14 ; * ( c ) * ; models of the two opposite chiralities ( cu omitted for clarity ) , indicating the observed angle matches within experimental error the geometric value of @xmath15.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the clear difference in the angle each uniquely chiral structure makes with high - symmetry directions on the cu(111 ) surface allows the chirality to be easily identifiable in larger - scale topography .",
    "[ angles ] ( a ) shows three larger domains of c@xmath06pn pinwheels .",
    "this image is almost completely drift free , as can be observed from the fourier transforms shown in [ angles ] ( b ) .",
    "this allows us to extract an accurate relative orientation of the two adjacent domains of opposite chirality , which can be seen to agree well with the proposed model structures in [ angles ] ( c ) .",
    "the simplest way to extract the angles is by inspection of [ sqfigchi ] ( c ) and ( d ) ; the periodicity of the pinwheels in the horizontal direction * i * is @xmath16 cu@xmath17 and in the vertical direction * j * is 1  cu@xmath17 , which gives the cartesian vector for the @xmath18 component of the unit cell of @xmath19 for the rh domain , and @xmath20 for the lh domain .",
    "this leads to an angle difference between the domains of 13.17 degrees , as shown in [ angles](c ) , and agrees well with the measured value in [ angles ] ( a ) of 13.5 degrees .",
    "this agreement between model and observation is striking given the complexity of the structure and their origins in very simple considerations : the known nucleation sites and orientations of the molecules on cu(111 ) and the preferred configurations and spacing between pn molecules on a cu(111 ) surface .",
    "the measurement of the angle between chiral domains can be considered a ` checksum ' of the veracity of the entire set of structure solutions .",

    "the capacity of pn molecules to rearrange themselves to form pinwheels around c@xmath0 molecules and the resultant sparse hexagonal chiral domains of c@xmath06pn heptamers are reminiscent of the case for c@xmath0/aca / ag(111 ) @xcite .",
    "for the c@xmath0/aca / ag(111 ) system , the route to the formation of extended coherent hexagonal domains is the hydrogen bonding of adjacent aca molecules , which provides a local ` matching rule ' that dictates the ultimate ( chiral ) film structure .",
    "although , due to the delocalization of a proton between the two o atoms on an aca molecule , it is considered to have the symmetry of a water molecule and is thus achiral on a surface , the formation of hydrogen bonds must necessarily associate the proton with a particular o and in doing so impose chirality upon each individual molecule . for the system under discussion ,",
    "in which there is no opportunity for hydrogen bonding , it turns out that no such molecular interaction is needed and the analogous characteristic is the sharing of pn molecules between adjacent pinwheels .",
    "once a c@xmath0 molecule has induced the formation of the first chiral pinwheel , further growth is constrained by the pn - sharing matching rule to produce an enantiopure domain . throughout this process",
    ", each individual molecule remains achiral and with an unchanged degree of symmetry .",
    "the electronic characteristic that defines a heterojunction is charge transfer between the donor and acceptor molecules . in order to quantify the degree of charge transfer ,",
    "we have calculated the electronic charge density in the proposed geometric unit cell of cu(111)(6 -4 , 4 10)3pn+c@xmath0 and compared it to the electronic charge density of the constituents alone ; this charge density difference ( cdd ) reflects the interactions between the acceptor and donor molecules .",
    "below , we begin by examining the cdd _ without surface cu atoms _ to examine the symmetric structure and then compare these results with the charge transfer calculated for pinwheels adsorbed onto cu in a relaxed morphology .",
    "as we are primarily interested in electronic and structural behavior , we only examine a single chirality below ( lh ) .        for the unsupported model ,",
    "the geometric structure of the pinwheel constituents was held fixed in its high - symmetry configuration .",
    "the computed cdd of the assembled pinwheel compared to its constituents alone ( in fixed geometry ) is shown in [ rees1 ] .",
    "a slice plane of the cdd through the pinwheel is shown which is taken at the average height of c atoms in pn molecules . using bader charge analysis",
    ", we find that each c@xmath0 experiences a charge transfer of -0.08@xmath27 relative to the nominal valence .",
    "the average charge transfer for a pn molecule is + 0.03@xmath27 relative to the nominal valence . from the results of both the cdd analysis and the bader charge partitioning ,",
    "it is clear that there is a small but existent charge transfer for the c@xmath0-pn pinwheel heterojunction in the absence of a cu support which can be seen in the blue halo around the c@xmath0 molecule in [ rees1 ] .    for our dft calculations of the cu - supported pinwheels ,",
    "we seek to first duplicate some features of experimental observations of pn monolayers on cu(111 ) .",
    "we begin with a low - coverage structure ( shown in supplemental information figure s1 ) to establish the binding energy and charge transfer for isolated pn / cu(111 ) .",
    "stm and afm measurements  @xcite have revealed some bowing of the pn molecule on the cu surface , where the ends of the molecule appear higher than the center .",
    "while bowing of pn / cu(110 ) @xcite has been reproduced with dft calculations , previous dft calculations for pn / cu(111 )  @xcite specifically excluded this from the calculation .",
    "we observe a bowing of the molecule with the ends approximately 0.15    higher than the central atoms in the pn molecule .",
    "we note that this bowing is less significant than observed on pn / cu(110 ) ( 0.4  ) , and also that the bowing was only observed when vdw - corrected dft calculations were employed .",
    "we find a binding energy for the isolated pn molecule on cu(111 ) of 1.4 ev .",
    "relaxation of the high density @xmath7-phase pn structure results in bowing of all of the pn molecules , as we previously observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the herringbone packing offers an additional @xmath280.2 ev stabilization to each pn through attractive surface - mediated nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "additionally , we have supplemented our electronic structure calculations with an analysis of charge transfer by using the bader charge analysis tools as implemented in vasp by the henkelman group@xcite .",
    "the charge transfer was determined to be @xmath29/pn in the isolated pn configuration and a slightly smaller @xmath30/pn in the @xmath7-phase ( interacting ) configuration .",
    "we next perform calculations to characterize the properties of the pn / c@xmath0 pinwheels on cu(111 ) . in [ rees3]a",
    ", the computed low energy geometry of the pinwheel is shown in a top - down view on the cu(111 ) surface itself . in the pinwheel",
    ", we observe some torsion of the pn molecules around their long axes in addition to the bowing observed at the ends relative to the middle , as described for the isolated and @xmath7-phase pn .",
    "also , the c@xmath0 rotates and shifts slightly off its originally constructed high symmetry axes relative to the surface and close - packed rows . in [ rees3]b , a comparative structural diagram of the symmetric unsupported pinwheel geometry ( red ) is overlaid on the computed low - energy geometry of the pinwheel adlayer on cu(111 ) ( green ) in a top - down view to highlight the shift from the high - symmetry site to one of the sixfold degenerate low - symmetry sites .    to understand the scale of the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of the chiral pinwheel network of cu(111)(6 -4 , 4 10)3pn+c@xmath0 , we calculate the relative energetics of this structure and compare it to those of low - coverage isolated pn molecules and to c@xmath0 molecules on cu(111 ) . as mentioned previously",
    ", there is an appreciable interaction of approximately -0.2 ev per pn to assemble @xmath7-phase pn as compared to low coverage pn on cu(111 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a approximately + 0.1 ev penalty per pn to distort the @xmath7-phase structure into the arrangement that pn occupies in the chiral pinwheels .",
    "finally , the net thermodynamic gain to assemble chiral pinwheels of 3pn+c@xmath0 as compared to a stoichiometric equivalent of @xmath7-phase pn and low coverage c@xmath0 on cu(111 ) is determined to be @xmath28 - 0.35 ev per pinwheel .",

    "the pinwheel structure can be seen to behave like a heterojunction ; the acceptor c@xmath0 becomes more negatively charged compared to the isolated c@xmath0 , while the pn becomes more positively charged compared to the isolated pn .",
    "the calculations show that the cu support helps enhance the charge transfer between pn and c@xmath0 as compared to the unsupported pinwheels , increasing its potential as a heterojunction .",
    ".computed bader charge ( @xmath27 ) for pn and c@xmath0 on the cu(111 ) surface in different structures . in this table ,",
    "electron accumulation relative to nominal valence is denoted as negative .",
    "the value given is the average per pn molecule . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabler ]    to further clarify the charge transfer in the dense chiral pn / c@xmath0 pinwheel on cu(111 ) , we have performed additional cdd analysis as shown in [ rees3 ] ; the slice plane is taken at the average @xmath31-height of the c - atoms in the pn molecules ( same as in [ rees1 ] ) . beyond the scale of the cdd ( enhanced by increased charge transfer due to the cu(111 ) surface as discussed above ) , a fundamental difference is the fact that the computed cdd for the pinwheel adlayer structure on cu(111 ) shows a net dipole rather than the six - fold symmetric cdd seen in [ rees1 ] .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the computed low - energy geometry acquires a minor asymmetry / tilt relative to the symmetric structure computed in the gas phase ; indeed , the dipole is oriented along the tilt direction of the c@xmath0 . as the pn molecules in the pinwheel additionally move with the asymmetric placing of the c@xmath0 molecule",
    ", this displacement may propagate throughout a pinwheel domain , which in turn may lock each domain into one of the 6 degenerate possibilities .",
    "however , as the additional movement of the pn molecules is very small , it is also possible that each c@xmath0 molecule may behave nearly independently of the others .",
    "we were unable to address this issue with our already computationally expensive single pinwheel basis set , and the effect is too subtle to prove or disprove with our experimental data .",
    "also , if pinwheels can all shift independently , the thermal barrier to motion may be low enough that the pinwheel averages out _ via _ rotation between the 6 possibilities .",
    "recent work has highlighted the switching behavior of c@xmath0 molecules adsorbed on clean metallic surfaces and also on predeposited molecular networks @xcite .",
    "c@xmath0 molecules switch between several stable orientations relative to the substrate when current is passed through them at a particular sample bias , leading to different molecular conductances .",
    "such switching behavior would seem to be compatible with the six degenerate possibilities for the c@xmath0 positions , though as the molecular orientation is equivalent in each case it is unlikely that there would be an appreciable effect on overall conductance of the c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the structures formed when pn and c@xmath0 are sequentially deposited on cu(111 ) . when c@xmath0 is deposited on @xmath7-phase pn , a mostly disordered layer is observed with little rearrangement of the close - packed pn layer beneath .",
    "however , when c@xmath0 is deposited on random - tiling pn , rearrangement of the more loosely - packed layer proceeds with the formation of locally chiral domains .",
    "two different unit cell structures are identified , the smaller of which is observed in single chirality domains extending up to 50 nm in largest dimension for the coverages studied .",
    "the variability of lattice parameters based on the relative arrangement of chiral pinwheels has not previously been observed , and it is possible that other structures may exist with larger lattice parameters and different populations of lh and rh pinwheels .",
    "van der waals corrected dft calculations were performed to help quantify energetic , geometric and charge - transfer properties of the experimentally observed systems .",
    "the calculations confirm there is a very appreciable net thermodynamic driving force to assemble the dense chiral pinwheel of 3pn+c@xmath0 on the cu(111 ) surface .",
    "further , the calculations show that the 3pn / c@xmath0 adlayer indeed shows charge transfer between pn and c@xmath0 , and this effect is enhanced when the molecules are assembled in the pinwheel geometry on the cu(111 ) surface .    as mentioned above ,",
    "switching behavior has been observed for c@xmath0 adsorption atop clean metallic surfaces and also atop a sam .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how such switching behavior , if present , is modified by the additional interaction of the pn molecules in this intermediate planar heterostructure system .",
    "as pn and c@xmath0 are archetypal donor and acceptor molecules , the electronic properties of the chiral heterostructures which are observed are critically important and demand further investigation . whether these structures on cu(111 ) are coupled strongly enough to provide a functional acceptor - donor heterojunction remains to be seen , but the self - assembly of these highly - symmetric molecules into chiral heterostructures suggests a template for realizing electronically active junctions with a handedness which should expand their potential technological impact .",
    "all measurements were carried out in a commercial omicron uhv vt - afm / stm operating with the sample maintained at 55 k. the cu(111 ) crystal was cleaned by simultaneously sputtering with ar@xmath32 ions at 1 kev and annealing to 900 k , with a final sputtering cycle at room temperature followed by an anneal at 900 k. pentacene and c@xmath0 were deposited from a dodecon 4-cell organic mbe source .",
    "pentacene was evaporated at 510 k , with a deposition rate on clean copper of approximately 0.2 ml per minute .",
    "pentacene films were annealed post deposition as described below , therefore the deposition rate is approximate and does not necessarily bear a relation to the ultimate coverage .",
    "carbon-60 was evaporated at 730 k , with a deposition rate on a pn film of approximately 0.07 ml per minute .",
    "deposition rates for each molecule were determined from subsequent stm topographs , by counting the number of molecules in a given area , comparing this to the number of molecules in a complete layer to find the coverage in ml .",
    "all gap voltages are quoted as sample bias .",
    "differential conductance ( di / dv ) maps , collected with the standard lock - in technique ( @xmath33 khz ) , are prepared by averaging forward scan and backward scan data to cancel the scan - induced artefacts from topography .",
    "tungsten tips were etched in 2 mol naoh solution in a two stage process involving a coarse etch at 10 v followed by a fine etch under an optical microscope at 2 v. when the tip picked up molecules during scanning  which resulted in the appearance of multiple tips in the images  it was @xmath27-beam heated at 2 w for 10 seconds ; this process usually restored the imaging quality .",
    "the @xmath7-phase ( @xmath1-phase ) was prepared by annealing a multilayer of pn to 400 k ( 420 k ) for 10 minutes . following this preparation and subsequent measurement of the pn films at 55 k ,",
    "the sample was warmed to ambient temperature and c@xmath0 was deposited to approximately 0.1 ml coverage .      in order to facilitate understanding of the molecular - level structure of the chiral pinwheels on cu(111 ) , as well as their energetic stability and capability to serve as charge - transfer heterojunctions , we have employed plane - wave density functional theory ( dft ) calculations as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite . the calculations used the paw@xcite treatment of core electrons , together with the revpbe@xcite density functional .",
    "van der waals corrections to the functional were implemented in the method of langreth and lundqvist@xcite .",
    "the prec = high accuracy extension in vasp was employed with a cutoff energy of @xmath8520 ev , fft mesh - grids large enough to avoid wrap around errors , and a default methfessel - paxton@xcite fermi - smearing of 0.2 ev .",

    "<S> we demonstrate the self - assembly of c@xmath0 and pentacene ( pn ) molecules into acceptor - donor heterostructures which are well - ordered and  despite the high degree of symmetry of the constituent molecules  _ </S>",
    "<S> chiral_. pn was deposited on cu(111 ) to monolayer coverage , producing the random - tiling ( @xmath1 ) phase as previously described . atop @xmath1-phase </S>",
    "<S> pn , post - deposited c@xmath0 molecules cause rearrangement of the pn molecules into domains based on chiral supramolecular ` pinwheels ' . </S>",
    "<S> these two molecules are the highest - symmetry achiral molecules so far observed to coalesce into chiral heterostructures . also , the chiral pinwheels ( composed of 1 c@xmath0 and 6 pn each ) may share pn molecules in different ways to produce structures with different lattice parameters and degree of chirality . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) results and knowledge of adsorption sites allow the determination of these structures to a high degree of confidence . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of chiral angles identical to those predicted is a further demonstration of the accuracy of the models . </S>",
    "<S> van der waals density functional theory calculations reveal that the pn molecules around each c@xmath0 are torsionally flexed around their long molecular axes and that there is charge transfer from c@xmath0 to pn in each pinwheel .    </S>",
    "<S> * keywords : pentacene , carbon-60 , scanning tunneling microscopy , chirality , pinwheel *    chiral surfaces and chiral surface structures have received a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite , both as powerful platforms for investigating the importance of symmetries in self - organization and chemical reactivity and for the potential technological dividends that they may pay . life on earth is enantiospecific ; not only is the origin of this handedness a persistent mystery , the chiral nature of many biomolecules is the reason that the physiological reaction to different enantiomeric forms of the same molecule can range from beneficial to inactive or even toxic . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the importance of developing systems which can perform enantio - selective catalysis or differentiate and/or separate enantiomers from one another . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , chiral molecules or structures can manifest their handedness in optical interactions , leading to circular dichroism , polarization - sensitive photoemission  @xcite , and allowed second - order nonlinear optical response  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two dimensional systems , _ i.e. _ surfaces , offer an important route to develop and explore these systems ; structural freedom dwindles from 230 space groups in 3d to 5 chiral groups in 2d @xcite . the introduction of chirality into the structure of self - assembled molecular systems provides a means of introducing a handedness to their functioning .    </S>",
    "<S> chirality at surfaces is common , as intrinsically chiral materials such as quartz have chiral surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these examples , any atomic epitaxial system in which the overlayer breaks the symmetry of the substrate is chiral , such as the commonly observed @xmath2 superstructure on an fcc(100 ) surface @xcite and @xmath3 superstructure on an fcc(111 ) surface @xcite . the pattern of kinks in the step edges of high - index crystal surfaces @xcite can be used to seed chiral surfaces , but these systems are often difficult to prepare due to the general degree of disorder of such surfaces borne from the low coordination of surface atoms compared to alternative low - index terminations . </S>",
    "<S> a much easier solution is to use molecular adsorbates to ` nanopattern ' a simple surface @xcite to add chiral selectivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to use chiral molecules to form chiral surfaces ; a racemic mixture of enantiomers may undergo separation upon adsorption to form enantiopure domains . _ </S>",
    "<S> prochiral _ molecules , which are achiral in the gas phase , develop surface - confined chirality upon adsorption on a 2d surface  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> homochiral 2d chirality can involve unit cells from one up to many molecules including ordering in which chiral arrangements of single molecules hierarchically self assemble to produce large - scale ordered chiral structures @xcite . when adsorbed on bi(111 ) , arrays of around 45 achiral pentacene ( pn ) molecules form homomolecular chiral pinwheels comprising six vanes of @xmath4-stacked sideways - laying molecules@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> polymers composed of achiral modules were also recently demonstrated to be capable of adopting chiral structures based on the flexibility of the molecules combined with the module conformation with the surface @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> pentacene and carbon-60 ( c@xmath0 ) are two archetypal molecules for the development of organic electronics and opto - electronics , boasting extremely high electron and hole mobilities , strong light absorption , and electron affinities which make them well - suited as donor and acceptor components of organic heterojunctions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when deposited on low - index metal faces , they are also archetypal systems for the study of self - assembly and generally form long - range achiral ordered networks . </S>",
    "<S> this is in large part due to their high degree of symmetry ; c@xmath0 is a spherical achiral molecule with @xmath5 ( icosahedral ) symmetry , and pn is a planar achiral aromatic molecule comprising five acene rings linearly fused along c - c bonds with @xmath6 symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> when adsorbed to single - layer coverage on single - crystal metal surfaces such as ag(111 ) , au(111 ) and cu(111 ) , pn forms well - ordered monolayers with the molecular plane parallel to the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> heterostructures involving pn and c@xmath0 on ag(111 ) have been reported , with the c@xmath0 molecules forming ` nanochains ' between rows of pn molecules in a pn bilayer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , chiral heterostructures including pn on ag(111 ) have been reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been recently shown that in - plane heterolayers with highly tunable structural parameters may be formed by varying the proportions of molecules sequentially deposited on an inert hopg surface @xcite . often , segregated domains of acceptor and donor molecules are formed following codeposition , as is observed for ex - ttf ( donor ) and pcbm ( acceptor ) molecules on au(111 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the use of precursor molecular layers to pattern co - adsorbed c@xmath0 is described in various reports @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated that when a molecule with a lower degree of symmetry than pn ( acridine-9-carboxylic acid ( aca ) ) is adsorbed on ag(111 ) prior to c@xmath0 , domains of chiral heterostructures can be formed @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the self - assembly of these highly symmetric and achiral acceptor and donor molecules into two different types of _ chiral _ heterojunctions , in which the degree of chirality and the lattice parameters of the resulting structures may be varied . to our knowledge , this is the most extreme example of symmetry - breaking observed on surfaces to date , where both molecules remain achiral if they are isolated on a surface  </S>",
    "<S> remaining achiral to monolayer coverage  but surrender this symmetry in these chiral structures . </S>",
    "<S> we present structure solutions for these phases that fit the data extremely well . </S>",
    "<S> we also present density functional theory ( dft ) calculations that quantify the stability and electronic behavior of these heterolayers and precursors and confirm that these chiral networks are low - energy states of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the constituent donor and acceptor molecules undergo charge transfer . </S>"
