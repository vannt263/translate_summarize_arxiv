    "the physical properties of asteroids provide us with important clues to clarify the compositions , strengths , and impact history of planetesimals that were formed in the early solar system .",
    "one representative methods for investigating the physical properties of asteroids is their lightcurve observations .",
    "lightcurve observations are able to deduce the rotational status and shapes of asteroids .",
    "past observations found that diameters of most asteroids rotating shorter than 2.2  h were smaller than 200  m @xcite .",
    "the fast - rotating asteroids have structurally significant tensile strength ( so - called monolithic asteroids ) because such asteroids need to overcome their own centrifugal force .",
    "on the other hand , the slow rotating asteroids larger than 200  m in diameter maintain themselves by their gravity or the cohesive force of bonded aggregates @xcite",
    ". some such asteroids are structurally rubble pile @xcite .",
    "the near - earth object ( neo ) , 2001  oe@xmath2 , has the largest diameter among fast - rotating asteroids whose rotational periods are reasonably determined in the asteroid lightcurve database ( lcdb ) with quality code u@xmath32 @xcite . when the geometric albedo @xmath4 is 0.18 , its diameter and rotational period are @xmath5  m and 29.1909  min , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xcite has reported that the diameter and rotational period of the neo 2001  fe@xmath6 are 200  m and 28.66  min , assuming the geometric albedo @xmath4 of 0.25 .",
    "the diameter and rotational period of 2001  vf@xmath7 are 1.39  h and 145665  m @xcite . despite searches having been devoted to their detection , few fast - rotating asteroids clearly larger than 200 m",
    "have been found @xcite .",
    "a numerical simulation indicates that fast - rotating asteroids are provided by the collisional disruption of parent bodies @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the diameter and rotational period of ejecta in a laboratory impact experiment is similar to that of monolithic asteroids @xcite .",
    "moreover , explorations by near and hayabusa spacecrafts have discovered that the shapes of boulders on neos ( 433 ) eros ( mean diameter of 16.84  km ) and ( 25143 ) itokawa ( mean diameter of 0.33  km ) resembled those of monolithic asteroids @xcite .",
    "therefore , monolithic asteroids are thought to be generated by impact craterings or catastrophic disruptions on the parent bodies .",
    "the rosetta and the near spacecraft have determined the size frequency distributions of boulders on the main belt asteroid ( mba ) ( 21 ) lutetia ( mean diameter of 95.76  km ) and eros @xcite . in the case of lutetia , the largest boulder is @xmath8  m in diameter .",
    "the power law index @xmath9 of the cumulative size - frequency distribution , @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12@xmath13 , is about -5 and becomes shallower in regions smaller than 150  m , where @xmath14 is the number of boulders and @xmath12 is the diameter of boulders .",
    "a similar trend in slope is also shown for eros .",
    "when we hypothesize that the size frequency distributions of the boulders on lutetia and eros are recognized as the typical size frequency distribution of impact ejecta , some ejecta smaller than 150  m can escape from the parent object that are likely to become small and fast - rotating asteroids .",
    "to confirm such a hypothesis , we need to show clearly how the fast - rotating asteroids inhabit from 150 m or less to subkilometer size by examining gradual but steady observational data accumulations .",
    "+ the purpose of our study is to obtain the rotational period , the taxonomic class for neo 2011  @xmath0 . since apparent",
    "brightness increases when neos closely encounter the earth , the observations of neos are suitable for the elucidation of physical properties of subkilometer - sized asteroids .",
    "revealing the taxonomic class confines the albedo , and increases the estimate accuracy for the diameter .",
    "2011  @xmath0 was discovered by pan - starrs ( the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ) on december 15 , 2011 .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath15 = 20.402 @xmath1 0.399 ( jpl small - body database ) indicates that the object is a subkilometer - sized asteroid .",
    "based on more than 100 astrometric observations for this asteroid , the orbital parameters are reduced to @xmath16 = 1.48 au , @xmath17 = 0.93 , @xmath18 = @xmath19 , @xmath20 = @xmath21 and @xmath22 = @xmath23 .",
    "its orbit is apparently similar to those of neo ( 3200 ) phaethon , @xmath16 = 1.27 au , @xmath17 = 0.89 , @xmath18 = @xmath24 , @xmath20 = @xmath25 and @xmath22 = @xmath26 , though the semi - major axis has a difference .",
    "phaethon is the parent body of the geminids , one of the most intense meteor showers throughout the year .",
    "moreover , the phaethon geminid complex ( hearafter , pgc ) like 2005 ud and 1999 yc , which are objects dynamically linked with phaethon and the geminids , are proposed @xcite . in fact",
    ", b / f / c taxonomy of 2005 ud and 1999 yc is shared by phaethon @xcite .",
    "we also investigate whether 2011  @xmath0 is a member of pgc by the multiband photometry and by calculating the orbital motion of both 2011  @xmath0 and phaethon . in this paper , we deal with the following : in section 2 , we describe the observations and their data reduction .",
    "in section 3 , we mention the results of rotational period , taxonomic class , and the orbital simulation . in section 4 , we discuss the relationship between 2011  @xmath0 and phaethon .",
    "moreover , we focus on the heating effect due to the close perihelion distance of 2011  @xmath0 . finally , we summarize the physical properties of 2011  @xmath0 and mention the observation efficiency of subkilometer - sized neo using small- and medium - aperture telescopes .",
    "we conducted the photometric observation of 2011  @xmath0 using the 1.0  m f/3 telescope and the 0.5  m f/2 telescope at the bisei spaceguard center ( bsgc ) .",
    "the observational circumstances and the states of 2011  @xmath0 are listed in table 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "both telescopes were operated with the non - sidereal tracking mode .",
    "the detector of 1.0  m telescope consisted of four ccd chips with 4096 @xmath27 2048 pixels .",
    "we used one ccd chip to obtain as many images as possible by shortening the processing time .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) for one ccd chip is @xmath28 @xmath27 @xmath29 with a pixel resolution of @xmath30 .",
    "the observations on december 16 , 2011 focused on the astrometry using the 1.0  m telescope with the exposure time of 150 s in 2 @xmath27 2 binning .",
    "individual images were taken with a commercially available short - pass ( long - wavecut ) filter indicating @xmath31 in table 1 whose effective wavelength ranged from 490  nm to 910  nm . though the observation was short term of about 45 min , we also used the data for the period analysis of the lightcurve observations .",
    "the lightcurve observations were mainly carried out on december 19 , 2011 using the 0.5  m telescope .",
    "the detector of the 0.5  m telescope is apogee u42 ccd with 2048 @xmath27 2048 pixels .",
    "the fov is @xmath32 @xmath27 @xmath32 with a pixel resolution of @xmath33 .",
    "the images were obtained with the exposure time of 120  s using @xmath34 filter @xcite . at the same time , multiband photometry was conducted using the 1.0  m telescope with sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 filters .",
    "we also measured the flux of 83 standard stars from sdss data release 8 @xcite , whose stars were imaged around the same airmass with 2011  @xmath0 .",
    "these objects have the @xmath36-band magnitudes of about 14 mag to 16 mag and classification code 1 (= primary ) , quality flag 3 (= good ) , and object class 6 (= star ) .",
    "one set of observations was made using three consecutive images for each filter .",
    "the filters were changed in the following sequence : three @xmath35 images ( 2011  @xmath0 ) @xmath39 three @xmath35 images ( standard stars ) @xmath39 three @xmath36 images ( 2011  @xmath0 ) @xmath39 three @xmath36 images ( standard stars ) @xmath39 three @xmath37 images ( 2011  @xmath0 ) @xmath39 three @xmath37 images ( standard stars ) @xmath39 three @xmath38 images ( 2011  @xmath0 ) @xmath39 three @xmath38 images ( standard stars ) .",
    "we repeated this sequence five times .",
    "part of the data could not be obtain due to unfavorable observing conditions between 17 h and 19 h in ut on december 19 .",
    "all images were obtained with exposure time of 120  s for each filter in no binning mode .",
    "all images were debiased and flat - fielded .",
    "all observation time data were corrected using a light - traveled time from 2011  @xmath0 to the earth . to obtain the lightcurve of 2011  @xmath0 , we measured the raw magnitude of 2011  @xmath0 and four reference stars that were imaged simultaneously on the same field using the iraf / apphot package .",
    "we set the radius of aperture photometry to @xmath40 @xmath27 fwhm for both 2011  @xmath0 and reference stars images , respectively .",
    "since the reference star images are slightly elongated due to the non - sidereal tracking , the aperture radius is larger than that of 2011  @xmath0 .",
    "we calibrated the magnitude fluctuations due to the change of atmospheric conditions using the procedures of @xcite .",
    "next , we performed the data reduction for multiband photometry .",
    "we evaluated the atmospheric extinction coefficients and conversion factors to standardize the sdss system for each filter , in which each atmospheric extinction coefficient was calculated by the magnitude variations of the standard stars for the change in airmass .",
    "extra - atmospheric instrumental magnitudes of both 2011  @xmath0 and the standard stars were derived using the obtained atmospheric extinction coefficient .",
    "the conversion factors were estimated by comparing the extra - atmospheric instrumental magnitudes with the cataloged magnitudes of standard stars .",
    "the brightness of 2011  @xmath0 in rotation inevitably changes during switching of the filter .",
    "we defined the time of recording the first @xmath41 image as the standard time , and then we calibrated an amount of brightness change for the standard time , which was estimated by the fitting curve of the lightcurve .",
    "assuming a double - peaked lightcurve , we carry out a periodicity analysis based on the lomb  scargle periodgram ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the power spectrum from the periodgram shows a period of 0.0304 @xmath1 0.0003 day (= 43.8 @xmath1 0.4 min ) .",
    "the folded lightcurve is shown in figure 1 .",
    "though the total observation duration was @xmath42 min over two nights , we were able to detect a number of same - shaped lightcurves because of a short rotational period .",
    "therefore , the period is sufficiently reliable to study .",
    "we also obtain the maximum amplitude of 0.68 mag by the fourth - order fourier series fitting curve .",
    "the lightcurve has a two - humped shape at the phase of @xmath43 .",
    "the two - humped shape could result from the obscuration of surface regions by local topography , because the solar phase angle was @xmath44@xmath45 during our observation .",
    "the taxonomic class and rotational color variation for 2011  @xmath0 are investigated by two color  color diagrams ( figure 2 ) . in order to determine the taxonomic class of 2011  @xmath0 , we should avoid the surface color variability due to surface heterogeneity of the rotating asteroid .",
    "however , the fast rotation of 2011  @xmath0 makes us difficult to obtain the roughly simultaneous four - color ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) data .",
    "we found all the color - indexes only between the phase 0.6 and 0.8 in the lightcurve .",
    "the graph legend of  phase 0.6 - 0.8 \" in figure 2 indicates the color index of 2011  @xmath0 between the phase 0.6 and 0.8 , and the graph legend of  other \" indicates the color - index , which is calculated from the averaged @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 magnitude except between the phases 0.6 and 0.8 , even if four - color data were not obtained in the same phase . in other words , the graph legend of  other \" shows the color - indexes obtained by assuming that there is no surface color heterogeneity . though the color - indexes in figure 2 show the taxonomy of 2011  @xmath0 is plausibly to be v - type , the photometric precision is insufficient to deny the possibility of s - type .",
    "we note that the classification of taxonomy , such as q , r , or , o - type , is difficult using this multiband photometry .",
    "therefore we conclude that 2011  @xmath0 is v - type or s - complex ( s- , q- , r- , o- , etc . ) . since there is no clear difference between the color - index of  phase 0.6 - 0.8 \" and  other \" in figure 2 , the surface color of 2011  @xmath0 is macroscopically homogeneous .",
    "we estimated the absolute magnitude @xmath46 and the effective diameter for 2011  @xmath0 .",
    "we deduced the apparent @xmath36 magnitude of 2011  @xmath0 on 19 december , 2011 was 16.35 @xmath1 0.05 mag at the phase where the relative magnitude was zero in figure 1 .",
    "the apparent @xmath47 magnitude is described in the following form @xcite , @xmath48 here , for our photometric precision requirements , the difference between ab magnitude and vega magnitude in the v - band is negligible . the reduced magnitude at the phase angle @xmath9 is expressed as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the heliocentric and geocentric distance in au .",
    "the absolute magnitude is expressed as a so - called @xmath15-@xmath52 function @xcite , @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the slope parameter depending on the asteroid s taxonomy .",
    "when we apply @xmath52 = 0.24 @xmath1 0.11 for s - complex and @xmath52 = 0.43 @xmath1 0.08 for v - type @xcite , @xmath46 becomes 20.56 @xmath1 0.43 mag ( s - complex ) and 20.84 @xmath1 0.25 mag ( v - type ) , respectively .",
    "an effective diameter of asteroids @xmath12 ( in kilometer ) is described as @xmath54 where @xmath4 is geometric albedo . assuming the albedo of 0.209 @xmath1 0.008 for s - complex @xcite and 0.297 @xmath1 0.131 for v - type @xcite",
    ", we found the diameter of 225 @xmath1 97  m ( s - complex ) and 166 @xmath1 63  m ( v - type ) , respectively .",
    "next , we estimate the axial ratio of 2011  @xmath0 . there is a relation between the lightcurve amplitude and the phase angle as follows : @xmath55 here",
    ", @xmath56 is the lightcurve amplitude at @xmath57 phase angle and @xmath58 is the slope coefficients . in the case of an s - type asteroid ,",
    "the @xmath58 value is 0.03 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath58 value depends on the surface roughness @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58 value is @xmath59 0.02 when we adopt the surface roughness 18@xmath45 of vesta as the representative for v - type @xcite . assuming the axial ratio of 2011  @xmath0 is projected on the plane of the sky , the lightcurve amplitude is described through the lower limit to the true axial ratio of the body as @xmath60 where @xmath16 and @xmath61 are respectively normalized long and short axis length .",
    "the amplitude of 2011  @xmath0 is 0.68 mag and the lightcurve data are obtained at the phase angle of @xmath59 40@xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the long axis length to the short axis length is larger than 1.3 ( s - complex ) and 1.4 ( v - type ) .",
    "the obtained physical properties of 2011  @xmath0 are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the construction of fast - rotating asteroids is thought to be a monolith .",
    "we confirm the validity for 2011  @xmath0 .",
    "if 2011  @xmath0 is preserved itself only by the self - gravity , the critical bulk density @xmath62 ( in g  @xmath63 ) for a rubble pile asteroid can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the rotational period in hours @xcite . substituting the rotational period and",
    "the lightcurve amplitude of 2011  @xmath0 into the equation ( 6 ) , the bulk density @xmath62 becomes 26.3  g  @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to it , a more precise calculation using a theory for cohesionless elastic - plastic solid bodies @xcite gives a lower limit on the bulk density of 20.5  g  @xmath63 ( p. pravec , personal communication ) .",
    "these are an incredible values as material of asteroids .",
    "therefore , 2011  @xmath0 is not a rubble pile but evidently a monolithic asteroid .",
    "+ we show the rotational period and the effective diameter on figure 3 for registered asteroids in the lcdb and 2011  @xmath0 .",
    "the effective diameter of 2011  @xmath0 on figure 3 corresponds to the mean value between the diameter of the assumed s - complex asteroids and the diameter of the assumed v - type asteroids .",
    "the range of errors designates the upper limit diameter of the assumed s - complex asteroids and the lower limit diameter of the assumed v - type asteroids .",
    "moreover , the rotational periods and effective diameters of 2001  oe@xmath2 , 2001  fe@xmath6 , 2001  vf@xmath7 and neo 2004  vd@xmath66 that have the possibility of being more than 200  m in diameter are plotted separately from the other asteroids in the lcdb .",
    "the nominal albedo in the lcdb for neos is 0.2 .",
    "the absolute magnitude is deduced by assuming @xmath52 of 0.15 .",
    "the typical uncertainty of the absolute magnitude in the lcdb is around 0.4  mag @xcite .",
    "we estimated that the diameter for 2001  oe@xmath2 in figure 3 based on the nominal value of the lcdb . for comparison ,",
    "when we adopt the nominal albedo and @xmath52 for 2011  @xmath0 , the effective diameter becomes @xmath59 250  m. indeed , the diameter includes the significant uncertainty due to the adopted albedo and absolute magnitude .",
    "we added the error bar for 2001  @xmath67 and 2001  @xmath68 that are monolithic asteroids and have roughly the same diameter as 2011  @xmath0 .",
    "the diameter and the error range for 2001  @xmath67 are adopted from the values of @xcite . the diameter and the error range for 2001  @xmath68 are estimated from @xmath15 = 20.1 and the a - type asteroids albedo , @xmath4 = 0.282 @xmath1 0.101 @xcite .",
    "the rotational period and diameter for 2004 vd @xmath66 are well determined as @xmath59 320  m and 1.99  h by the visible - near infrared spectroscopy and the polarimetry .",
    "though the rotational period indicates that the construction of 2004 vd@xmath66 is categorized as a monolith , the slightly short rotation for the spin limit of 2.2  h is not deny to be partially fractured @xcite . therefore , 2011  @xmath0 is a candidate of the second - largest fast - rotating monolithic asteroid behind 2001  oe@xmath2 .",
    "we computed the orbital motions of 2011  @xmath0 and phaethon , to compare their evolutional behavior and trace their genetic relationship if possible .",
    "indeed , the orbital similarity criterion , @xmath69 @xcite between 2011  @xmath0 and phaethon is 0.196 , suggesting that 2011  @xmath0 has a possible association range for the orbit of geminids , because @xmath69 of less than 0.2 indicates the typical associating range . here",
    "we performed the backward and forward numerical integration of the post - newtonian equation of motion over @xmath70  yr from initial epoch , applying the  solex \" , ver .",
    "11.01 package , developed by @xcite based on the bulirsh - stoer ( bs ) integrator .",
    "then we also computed other possible motions of each asteroid , generating multiple  clones \" at the initial epoch , and integrating them .",
    "as well as the nominal osculating orbit , other clones had slightly different orbital elements , with the @xmath71 error based on observational uncertainties .",
    "we generated the clones on the basis of three possible values ( nominal and @xmath72 ) for five orbital elements [ @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ; @xmath73 ; @xmath22 ] , thus yielding a total of 243 @xmath75 clones , including the nominal one .",
    "coordinates and velocities of the planets , moon , and four quasi - planets , ceres , pallas , vesta , and pluto , regarded as point masses , were based on jpl s de / le406-based ephemerides .",
    "we confirmed that the results of our numerical integrations did not significantly change when we used other integration methods that we have often applied in our studies , e.g. , the adams method .",
    "our integrator can accurately process very close encounters by means of a routine that makes automatic time - step adjustments , and truncation and round - off errors are almost negligible for our investigation here .",
    "although the error of the orbital energy in the computation , using the bs method , shows a linear increase with time @xcite , it has an insignificant effect on our integration of @xmath70  yr .",
    "hence , the solex is rather reliable for dealing with our issue . as initial parameters , up to date",
    "osculating orbital elements were taken from nakano s data ( personal communication ) for 2011  @xmath0 and the jpl small - body database for phaethon , as listed in table  [ tbl : xporbit ] .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath70  yr orbital evolutions of 2011  @xmath0 and phaethon . over @xmath76",
    "yr , we found both the asteroids to behave with a high degree of stability with long - period secular changes according to the @xmath22-cycle , i.e. , kozai circulation @xcite .",
    "the corresponding large - amplitude oscillations in @xmath77-@xmath18 and antiphase with @xmath17 occur , thus the period of their cycles @xmath78 , which is half that of the @xmath22-cycle , @xmath79 @xcite , suggesting a typical example of the kozai circulation .",
    "it is interesting that a spread of the 2011  @xmath0 clones looks rather more compact than expected , in spite of preliminary orbital solution of 2011  @xmath0 , probably due to all the clones being in the stable region of the kozai mechanism . the @xmath22-cycle of @xmath80  yr for 2011  @xmath0 is shorter than that of @xmath81  yr for phaethon .",
    "the time - lag of the orbital evolutions or @xmath22-cycles between 2011  @xmath0phaethon seems to be near 0 yr , since @xmath22 values of both objects are almost consistent , therefore not so clear as an example of 2005 ud  phaethon @xcite . @xmath69 between 2011  @xmath0phaethon is presently at around the minimum , in the past @xmath82  yr , however somewhat large when we consider their genetic relation .",
    "also semi major axis of 2011  @xmath0 is larger than those of any other pgcs .",
    "in addition , our s - complex or v - type taxonomic classification for 2011  @xmath0 does not harmonize with the b / f - type taxonomy of phaethon @xcite .",
    "therefore , 2011  @xmath0 is not a pgc member .",
    "as we mentioned in the section above , 2011  @xmath0 is not a pgc member based on the taxonomic analysis and the orbital calculation .",
    "nevertheless , phaethon with nominal orbital elements has more opportunities for close encounters with 2011  @xmath0 than with either the earth or the moon : 59 times within @xmath83 au in the past @xmath82 years with 2011  @xmath0 , in comparison with 23 times with the earth and moon .",
    "this reminds us of the possibility of a collisional event . in recent years ,",
    "an unexpected brightening and a comet - like dust tail were detected on phaethon around the perihelion @xcite .",
    "this was because thermal fractures and decomposition cracking of hydrated minerals produced the dust ejections , whether the amount of dust production was enough to supply the geminids in steady state or not was not concluded .",
    "the sublimation of ice inside the pgc precursor object due to the thermal evolution has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the breakup of pgc precursor object @xcite .",
    "alternatively , impacts event can not be denied as a possible breakup mechanism .",
    "in addition , it is interesting that there exists a rotationally s - type - like color region on phaethon s surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , we infer a @xmath84 that 2011  @xmath0 might be a remnant candidate impacted with a potential pgc precursor .",
    "intense solar radiation heating by the perihelion distance of 0.11 au elevates temperature of the surface material of 2011  @xmath0 . assuming 2011  @xmath0 as s - type asteroid @xmath4 = 0.209 and @xmath52 = 0.24",
    ", we can estimate the frm ( fast rotating model ) surface temperature @xcite heating up to 900  k. 2011 @xmath0 is heated repeatedly when it comes close to the sun and the duration at 900  k reaches at least 3,000  yrs ( figure 4 ) , which could result in unique mineralogy of the surface material of 2011  @xmath0 . a recent sample return mission from s - type asteroid itokawa revealed that continuous reduction reaction from feo to metallic fe due to solar proton implantation to silicates is a main mechanism for developing reduction rims of the silicate crystals on the regolith surface @xcite .",
    "the reduction rims are responsible for space weathering of s - type asteroids .",
    "the same reactions are expected to occur on the surface of 2011  @xmath0 at a much higher weathering rate , because the asteroid is much closer to the sun and the reaction takes place at an elevated temperature . at a low - temperature surface of silicates ,",
    "the space weathering process makes the reduction rims , consisting of amorphous silicates and metallic iron , from feo - bearing crystalline silicates @xcite . on the other hand , at a high - temperature surface of silicates on the asteroid 2011 @xmath0 , it is expected that the reduction rims thicken , the amorphous silicates crystallize , and the small fe particles integrate .",
    "our results show that 2011  @xmath0 shows a reflectance spectrum feature intermediate between s- and v - type ( figure 2 ) .",
    "a meteoritic analog for the surface composition of s - type corresponds to ordinary chondrites that consist mainly of olivine , pyroxene , and plagioclase .",
    "the following reaction would take place if olivine were present on the surface :    @xmath85    since the reaction proceeds at high temperature , h@xmath7o evaporates away from the surface and mgsio@xmath86 crystallizes to pyroxene for a short time .",
    "therefore , pyroxene / olivine ratio and fe metal abundance are expected to increase on the surface of 2011  @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the increase of pyroxene / olivine ratio is an opposite trend induced by early thermal metamorphism that occurred in the interior of an s - type asteroid 4.6 billion years ago @xcite . as for other components of s - type asteroids ,",
    "pyroxene is more difficult to be reduced than olivine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and plagioclase does not contain feo to be reduced .",
    "therefore a major change in mineralogy of the surface of  s - type \" 2011 @xmath0 is an increase in the pyroxene / olivine ratio and fe - metal abundance .",
    "if 2011  @xmath0 is a v - type asteroid whose meteorite analog is he d ( howardrites , eucrites , and diogenites ) meteorites , consisting mainly of pyroxene and plagioclase , in this case the mineralogical change is limited to further crystallization of individual minerals .",
    "the increase in the pyroxene / olivine ratio during high - temperature space weathering of s - type asteroids makes the mineral assemblage similar to v - type asteroids , which are rich in pyroxene .",
    "2011  @xmath0 may be an s - type asteroid with a high pyroxene / olivine or a v - type asteroid . in either case , the reflectance spectrum is similar and difficult to distinguish as we observed in the color - color diagram ( figure 2 ) .",
    "last , we mention the possibility of q - type because the color - color diagram of 2011  @xmath0 indicates the intermediate between s- and v - type , and the population ration of q - type asteroids is dominant in the neo region than r- and o - type .",
    "the cause of 2011  @xmath0 being a monolith is thought to the rotational fission of a rubble pile object due to the yorp effect , and the ejector by impact craterings or catastrophic disruption on the parent bodies . as we describe above",
    ", the heating to 900  k promotes the space weathering .",
    "however , if the rotational fission and the ejection by impacts took place recently , the surface of 2011  @xmath0 has not been long exposed to the solar radiation . in that case",
    ", the surface color of 2011  @xmath0 might indicate q - type .",
    "this study revealed the physical properties of 2011  @xmath0 by the photometric observation .",
    "we detected the lightcurve periodicity to be 0.0304 @xmath1 0.0003 day (= 43.8 @xmath1 0.4 min ) .",
    "the lightcurve amplitude and rotational period clearly deduced 2011  @xmath0 to be a monolithic asteroid .",
    "the multiband photometric analysis indicated that the taxonomic class of 2011  @xmath0 was s - complex , or v - type . assuming the typical albedo data for s- and v - type",
    ", we found the diameter of 2011  @xmath0 ranging between 103323  m , implying the second - largest asteroid among fast - rotating asteroids .",
    "we also performed a dynamical simulation for both 2011  @xmath0 and phaethon to be not of common origin . +",
    "this study ensures the existence of subkilometer - sized fast - rotating monolithic asteroids , of which only a few have been discovered , 2001 oe@xmath2 , 2001 fe@xmath6 and 2001 vf@xmath7 .",
    "however , the cumulative size - frequency distribution and the other physical properties for subkilometer - sized fast - rotating monolithic asteroids have not been well explained due to the shortage of physical observations of subkilometer - sized asteroids . to detect the fast - rotating monolithic asteroids and deduce the physical properties ,",
    "the photometric , multiband , and spectroscopic observations should be conducted immediately following the discovery of neos , which are listed on the neo confirmation page of minor planet center .",
    "continuous observations of this kind lead us to clarify the population and size - distribution of subkilometer - sized fast - rotating monolithic asteroids .",
    "we acknowledges to s. nakano for his orbital solution of 2011  @xmath0 .",
    "we also thank n. takahashi , m. yoshikawa , and the staff members of bisei spaceguard center for their support for our observation .",
    "s. hasegawa provided us with valuable advice regarding v - type asteroids .",
    "we also acknowledge the japan space forum .",
