    "linear confining potentials in the relativistic regime are important quantum mechanical models to examine the phenomenology of quarkonium and their confinement properties .",
    "it was well studied that when the linear potential is introduced as a lorentz scalar in the relativistic wave equation ( rwe ) such as klein - gordon ( kg ) or dirac equation , quantum confinement is possible @xcite .",
    "this is because a scalar potential in rwe is equivalent to a position dependent of the rest mass similar to the mit bag model of quark confinement @xcite .",
    "if the potential is introduced as a lorentz vector , no bound state solutions are possible due to the existence of the klein paradox @xcite . in this case only tunneling solutions are possible .",
    "for the mixtual of both scalar - like and vector - like potential , bound states can only exist if the strength of scalar - like potential is stronger than the vector - like potential @xcite .",
    "for the critical case when the strength of the both potentials are exactly equal , confinement is impossible and only scattering solution arises @xcite .",
    "dirac oscillator is the dirac equation in which the momentum is replaced by the non - minimal coupling @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the position operator , @xmath2 is the particle mass , @xmath3 is the usual dirac matrix and @xmath4 is the frequency of the oscillator .",
    "it has been used to model quark confinement in strong force .",
    "the non - relativistic limit reproduces the usual harmonic oscillator with very strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "these properties are valid under usual heisenberg commutation relation .    modified commutation relations ( mcr s ) have been extensively studied as an effective means of encoding potential gravitational or stringy effects @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the consequent deformations of quantum mechanical spectra might be detectable in future low - energy experiments @xcite .",
    "while most of the studied mcr s incorporate a minimum position uncertainty and usually leads to the concept of minimal length @xcite which generally known as the main prediction by generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) , there are others that exhibit a maximum momentum cutoff @xcite as in doubly special relativity ( dsr ) .",
    "we have investigated large classes of deformed quantum mechanics of the latter type and used it to study several quantum mechanical systems such as deformed harmonic oscillator ( dho ) @xcite , a particle in potential well / barrier and their bound / scattering states @xcite as well as generalized coherent states with maximum momentum @xcite .    in one - dimension ,",

    "intrinsic maximum momentum arises when @xmath7 has a singularity @xcite or a zero at some @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "one effect of maximum momentum is that the spectrum of bound states terminates at finite energy even for potentials like the harmonic oscillator @xcite ; this is in contrast to mcr s which exhibit instead a minimum position uncertainty @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we focussed on the class of mcr s defined by characteristic function @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real parameters .",
    "indeed , @xmath12 is the deformed parameter with dimension of inverse momentum , @xmath13 such that @xmath14 is the planck mass and @xmath15 is the planck length .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath16 is usually assumed to be of order unity , which implies the @xmath12-dependent terms are only important in the planck regime , i.e. when energy and momentum are comparable to planck energy ( momentum ) and the size is of order planck length .",
    "this form of mcr leads to dsr - inspired modified uncertainty principle ( mup ) which is consistent with string - theory gup and results from black hole physics .",
    "for @xmath17 , eq . has a zero and hence ( in momentum space ) eq . implies an intrinsic maximum momentum . for @xmath18",
    "there is no intrinsic maximum momentum but rather a minimum position uncertainty . for simplicity , we consider only the case @xmath19 and the generic result should be similar for all @xmath20 .    in sect.(2 )",
    "we review the main relations of quantum mechanics based on mcr s and discuss the ideas of minimal length and intrinsic maximum momentum cutoff . in sect.(3 ) , modified dispersion relation is considered up to leading order correction .",
    "superluminal propagation of photons is possible by mcr in the planck regime which consistents with the varying speed of light phenomena . in sect.(4 ) we study the one - dimensional free ( and with both scalar / vector - like potential ) kg equation .",
    "using momentum and position representation interchangeably , we solve the bound state energy spectrum and corresponded wavefunctions .",
    "we show that , for spinless particle satisfies kg wave equation , the energy spectrum is bounded from above and hence the number of the bound state solutions is finite .",
    "this is the generic result of mcr s with intrinsic maximum momentum cutoff as in their non - relativistic counterpart @xcite . in sect.(5 ) and ( 6 ) , with the same token we consider the dirac equation with scalar / vector linear potential and dirac oscillator respectively .",
    "the bound state energy spectrum , wavefunctionas and number of state are determined .",
    "also , we compute the mup for dirac oscillator and show that the non - relativistic limit reproduces same feature as dho . finally we conclude in sect.(7 ) .",

    ", an intrinsic maximum momentum of @xmath40 which is favoured by deformed special relativity @xcite can be realised with mcr s in ( [ class ] ) with certain range of @xmath11 values .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the mcr - inspired mup also exhibits a peculiar form of the uv / ir mixing that may allow short distance physics to be probed by large scale physics and vice versa . from , when @xmath36 is large ( uv ) , @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath36 ( for @xmath41 ) .",
    "thus @xmath37 is also large ( ir ) .",
    "this scenario is expected from most of the quantum gravity phenomenology such as ads / cft correspondence and noncommutative field theory .",
