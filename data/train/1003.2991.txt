    "one of the unsolved mysteries in modern condensed matter physics is the mechanism of the high temperature superconducting ( htsc ) cuprates lee:2006 .",
    "these materials are layered compounds with copper - oxygen planes and are doped mott insulators with strong electronic correlations .",
    "the pairing symmetry is unconventional and there is a strong experimental evidence showing that it is d - wave@xcite .",
    "it is speculated that the pairing between electrons is mediated via strong anti - ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the system .",
    "a prominent strong coupling theory is proposed by anderson , called the resonant valence bond ( rvb ) theory , which describes liquid state with spin - singlets . upon hole doping ,",
    "the nel order is destroyed and give rise to superconductivity@xcite .",
    "several gauge theories have been proposed to formulate the rvb physics , by enforcing the double occupation constraint in the strong coupling limit@xcite .",
    "the problem is difficult due to the strong - coupling nature of the theory .",
    "although significant progress has been made in the past few years , alternative approaches may be valuable to tackle the problem .",
    "one alternative approach is the holographic correspondence between a gravitational theory and a quantum field theory , which first emerged under ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "this method has provided a useful and complimentary framework to describe strong interaction systems without a sign problem ( see e.g. policastro:2001yc , herzog:2006gh , liu:2006ug , gubser:2006bz , herzog:2007ij , hartnoll:2007ih , hartnoll:2007ip , hartnoll:2008hs ) . in the original top - down approach , both the gravity side and the field theory side of the theories are precisely known .",
    "later applications assume that the correspondence exists among different pair of theories and try to make predictions from one side of the correspondence .",
    "more specifically , in this bottom - up approach , usually the gravity side of the theory is explicitly constructed with the desired symmetries , then physical observables ( matrix elements ) of the field theory side are predicted through the above mentioned correspondence .",
    "recently , a gravitational model of hairy black holes gubser:2005ih , gubser:2008px have been used to model s - wave htsc hartnoll:2008vx , hartnoll:2008kx , horowitz:2009ij , gubser:2008zu . in those class of models the abelian symmetry of a complex scalar field is spontaneously broken ( i.e. the higgs mechanism ) below some critical temperature .",
    "the meissner effect was soon observed by including magnetic field in the background@xcite .",
    "the effect of superconducting condensate on the holographic fermi surface has been studied by calculating fermionic spectral function chen:2009pt , faulkner:2009am , gubser:2009dt .",
    "interestingly , the properties of spectral function appeared to have similar behaviour to that found in the angle resolved photo - emission experiment .",
    "motivated by all of these s - wave studies , holographic dual to p - wave superconductor has been proposed by coupling a @xmath3 yang - mills field to the black hole , where a vector hair develops in the superconducting phasegubser:2008wv , roberts:2008ns , martin:2009plb , pallab .",
    "behaviour of fermionic spectral function has also been studied in those p - wave superconducting background @xcite .",
    "so far , the bottom - up construction of holographic superconductor assuming the existence of gauge / gravity duality has been discussed .",
    "however , in the string theory framework people also have studied top - down approach considering various d - brane configurations in the ads black hole background @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we try to construct a minimal gravitational model that models d - wave htsc .",
    "we replace the complex scalar field in @xcite by a tensor field whose condensate breaks the symmetry spontaneously below @xmath0 and the condensate becomes zero and the symmetry is restored above @xmath0 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath4 gives the mean field value @xmath5 .",
    "the real part of the conductivity computed from linear response has a delta function at zero frequency which corresponds to static superconductivity below @xmath0 . above @xmath0 ,",
    "the delta function disappears as expected and the conductivity becomes constant in frequency . * *  * * it is expected that there is no hard gap  in the real part of the conductivity and the conductivity should be isotropic even though the condensate is not ( for a model calculation , see @xcite ) .",
    "both features are seen in our results .",
    "our goal is to consider a minimal ( 3 + 1 dimensional ) holographic model that gives rise to ( 2 + 1 dimensional ) d - wave superconductivity .",
    "the construction will be similar to that of the s - wave case @xcite with a spontaneous local @xmath1 symmetry breaking in the bulk leading to a spontaneous breaking of global @xmath1 symmetry at the boundary .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the boundary theory is a super - fluid .",
    "one can still study the current - current correlator which could be interpreted as the conductivity .    to have a d - wave condensate at the boundary , we introduce a charged tensor field in our dual gravity theory . assuming the d - wave condensate originating from electron - electron pairing , the d - wave nature gives a symmetric wave function for the pair .",
    "so , wave function for this electron pair has to be a spin singlet such that its total wave function is anti - symmetric .",
    "a @xmath6 symmetric traceless tensor has @xmath7 components which can be used to describe a d - wave state",
    ". we will promote this symmetric traceless tensor field to include time components and denote the field as @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , it is important to note that the interacting higher spin fields , in general , require to satisfy additional constraints in addition to the equations of motion to remove the unphysical degrees of freedom , see the discussion in @xcite for example .",
    "observing that there is no available consistent model for our purpose , we would like to propose a truncated model which has sufficient ingredients to catch some features of d - wave superconductor .",
    "it would be an important but difficult task to construct a complete theory which we would like to postpone for the future in order to attain our simple goal through the present exercise .    * *  * * the desired complete action including gravity , @xmath1 gauge field , tensor field and other auxiliary fields , may take the following form@xcite : @xmath12 ,   \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath13 is the ricci scalar , the @xmath14 term gives a negative cosmological constant and @xmath15 is the ads radius which will be set to unity in the units that we use .",
    "@xmath16 is the gravitational coupling .",
    "@xmath17 is the covariant derivative in the black hole background ( @xmath18 in flat space ) , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the charge and mass squared of @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the terms associated with auxiliary fields are included in @xmath21 .",
    "this lagrangian is the same as that appears in @xcite in the flat space limit .",
    "however in the subsequent studies after @xcite it appeared that construction of higher spin field lagrangian coupled to gravity or @xmath1 gauge in a gauge invariant way is non - trivial even in minkowski space @xcite . but later on in the context of gravitational interaction @xcite it has been shown that this task may have a solution in ads space .",
    "also there exists a recent attempt to construct gauge invariant @xmath1 charged massive spin 2 particles in ads space at linear approximation @xcite . in spite of all these studies",
    "fully consistent formulation of interacting higher spin gauge fields is still lacking . keeping this in mind that the action in ( [ lagrangian ] ) without @xmath21 contains spurious degrees of freedom that may cause the instability .",
    "we will proceed by assuming that the constrains can eliminate the instabilities but still allow the d - wave condensation .",
    "@xmath22 might look more familiar with the rescaling @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "here we also concentrate on the probe limit  @xcite where the back - reaction to the background can be ignored .",
    "this limit is exact when @xmath25 . in the probe limit",
    ", @xmath22 can be treated as a perturbation on top of the 3 + 1 dimensional ads black hole background:@xmath26where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the horizon size . the hawking temperature for this black hole @xmath29 .    as in s - wave case",
    "@xcite , electric field can exist in the bulk by the appropriate choice of boundary conditions .",
    "the charged tensor field , which can be considered as charged particles , experiences a force under the electric field , with positive(negative ) charges repelled(attracted ) away from(toward ) the black hole .",
    "one the other hand , the black hole tries to pull all the charged particles in it . at lower @xmath30 ,",
    "the black hole is smaller and the gravitational pull is weaker .",
    "thus , the positively charged particles have a bigger chance to stay outside the horizon and form the condensate . at very large @xmath30 ,",
    "the gravitational force from the large black hole is strong enough to pull all the charged particles into the horizon such that there is no condensate .",
    "thus , we have a phase transition .",
    "we are interested in describing the d - wave sc in the continuum such that there is a condensate on the @xmath31-@xmath32 plane on the boundary with translational invariance .",
    "rotational symmetry is broken down to @xmath33 with the condensate changing its sign under a @xmath34 rotation on the @xmath31-@xmath32 plane . to incorporate these features",
    ", we use an ansatz for the @xmath8 and the gauge field @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36    after plugging in this ansatz , we have the equation of motion for @xmath37 @xmath38 f^{\\prime } ( r)+\\left\\ { \\frac{r^{2}\\phi ^{2}(r)}{g(r)^{2}}-\\frac{\\left [ m^{2}r+2g^{\\prime } ( r)\\right ] r}{g(r)}\\right\\ } f(r)=0 ,   \\label{eom1}\\]]and the corresponding maxwell s equation is @xmath39where the @xmath40 is the derivative with respect to @xmath41 .    we would like to choose the solution such that @xmath42 has the asymptotic form @xmath43near the boundary @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is interpreted as the chemical potential and @xmath46 as the charge density in the boundary theory . here , we will first assume this and then show that indeed this can be satisfied later .",
    "now , the asymptotic of eq.[eom1 ] ) has the asymptotic form    @xmath47    near the boundary , which yields @xmath48if we interpret @xmath49 as the source and @xmath50 as the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the operator that couples to @xmath37 at boundary theory , we need @xmath51 ( and @xmath52 ) such that the @xmath50 term is constant or vanishing at the boundary . after setting the source @xmath53 and using @xmath52 , eq.([max ] ) indeed gives the asymptotic solution of eq.([phi ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath54 term does not impose a constraint on @xmath20 by requiring that the third term on the lhs of eq.([max ] ) to be smaller than the other two terms since we have imposed @xmath53 .",
    "one way to see this is to do the integration of the differential equations from the boundary , then @xmath55 , @xmath56 satisfy the asymptotic behaviors of eqs.([eom1 ] ) and ( [ max ] ) .",
    "the order parameter of the boundary theory can be read off from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath37 , @xmath57where @xmath58 are the indexes in the boundary coordinates @xmath59 .    it is useful to note that the action and the equations of motion are invariant under the scaling@xmath60thus , we can always scale @xmath61 .",
    "this also helps to keep track of the scaling dimension for observables , e.g. , the scaling dimensions for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath50 are 1 , 2 , and @xmath62 , respectively .     shown as a function of @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "the condensate goes to zero at @xmath65 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath66 for @xmath67 is of the mean field value @xmath68 . ]    in fig . 1",
    ", we show the numerical result between the dimensionless quantities @xmath69 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "it is a second order phase transition .",
    "numerically , the critical exponent @xmath4 defined as @xmath70 for @xmath67 is very close to the mean field value @xmath2 .",
    "below we show that only the values @xmath71 satisfy the equations of motion .",
    "thus , without fine tuning , one would get the mean field value @xmath2 .",
    "now we present the derivation .",
    "the metric @xmath72 is a smooth function of @xmath73 , while @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be expanded as    @xmath76    since , eq.([eom1 ] ) is a linear equation in @xmath75 and the pre - factors of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are polynomials of @xmath79 , the pre - factor of @xmath80 has to be a polynomial of @xmath79 as well in order the satisfy the equation .",
    "this implies @xmath81 is an integer . at @xmath0 and at the boundary",
    ", @xmath74 gives the value of chemical potential which is finite .",
    "this yields @xmath82 .",
    "analogously , the maxwell equation , eq.([max ] ) , is linear in @xmath74 .",
    "the pre - factors of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are polynomials of @xmath79 and thus the pre - factor of @xmath42 is required to be a polynomial of @xmath79 .",
    "this yields @xmath85 to be an integer .",
    "we also know that @xmath86 for a second order phase transition , and hence only @xmath87are allowed .",
    "in this section , we compute the conductivity of this d - wave htsc by linear response .",
    "the conductivity tensor @xmath88 can be defined through the linear response relation @xmath89where @xmath90 . @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the electric current and electric field , respectively . following the approach of @xcite , we perturb the gauge field by @xmath93 . to get a consistent set of equations",
    ", we also need to perturbe @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are    @xmath96    @xmath97 b_{rx }   \\notag \\\\ & = & -\\frac{2f}{r^{3}}a_{x}-\\frac{(\\omega -\\phi ) g^{\\prime } } { g^{2}}b\\text{$_{tx},$ }   \\label{b1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath98 b\\text{$_{tx}$}=(\\omega -\\phi ) g^{\\prime } b\\text{$_{rx}.$ } \\label{b1x}\\ ] ]    in principle , we can also add other @xmath99  components in the perturbation .",
    "however , those components do not couple to @xmath100 to the quadratic order in the action .",
    "so , if we set the initial condition of our system to be in the ground state before @xmath100 perturbation being turned on then those extra @xmath37 field perturbations will not be produced .",
    "however , in the full stability analysis , those @xmath100 independent perturbations are important .",
    "we will defer this stability analysis to future study .",
    "eq.([ax ] ) is very similar to the s - wave case and is decoupled from @xmath99 .",
    "near the boundary , we have@xmath101which yields the asymptotic form@xmath102where @xmath103 is the @xmath31-component gauge field at the boundary whose time derivative gives @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the expectation value of the current operator @xmath106 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath106 and @xmath104 is the frequency dependent conductivity @xmath107    the fact that eq.([ax ] ) depends only on @xmath108 implies@xmath109this is dictated by the reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath110 plane .",
    "we are now focusing on the case @xmath111 , where the asymptotic forms of eqs.([b1 ] ) and ( [ b1x ] ) are particularly simple:@xmath112these two equations can be solved with @xmath113where @xmath114 and @xmath115 is defined in eq.([10 ] ) . here",
    ", we also identify @xmath116 and @xmath117 as the source terms and @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the normalizable fluctuations . near the horizon , @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the equations of motion become@xmath123    @xmath124    @xmath125    the solutions near the horizon are@xmath126    the ingoing wave boundary condition @xcite , which sets the wave falling into the horizon , demands @xmath127 .",
    "we further set the divergent term @xmath128 to keep the action finite .",
    "now , @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the eq.([a3 ] ) are linear combinations of @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "so we have both normalizable and non - normalizable solutions for @xmath133 and @xmath134 perturbations .",
    "the divergent source terms @xmath135 and @xmath117 near the boundary can be cancelled by counter terms @xcite .     for different temperatures . above @xmath0 ,",

    "2 , we plot the real and imaginary part of @xmath141 for different @xmath30 .",
    "the behaviours are similar to that of s - wave htsc .",

    "on the othe hand for @xmath145 , the delta function and @xmath146 $ ]  disappear and @xmath142 $ ] becomes @xmath147 independent .",
    "there is no hard gap  in our dual boundary superconducting system because @xmath142 $ ] does not vanish even for arbitrary small @xmath147 .",
    "one can also read off this soft gap from the plot , i.e. @xmath148 .",
    "it is larger than the one obtained in the construction for s - wave@xcite , where @xmath149 .",
    "this may imply our d - wave pairing requires higher energy than the s - wave one .",
    "unlike the case for s - wave superconductor , the vanishing of the gap is actually expected in the d - wave case . in the bcs - type theory ( see , e.g. dwave bcs ) , the lowest dimensional d - wave operator for two fermion pairing is @xmath150 , where @xmath151  is the relative momentum between the two fermion which is invariant under galilean transformation .",
    "the leading order lagrangian in a weakly interaction theory is @xmath152where @xmath153  is the free lagrangian , @xmath154  is the coupling and @xmath155  is an external source . under a hubbard stratanovich transformation ,",
    "the lagrangian can be rewritten as @xmath156 + \\frac{b_{ij}^{\\dagger } b_{ij}}{c}+cj_{ij}^{2},\\]]where @xmath37  and @xmath157  are auxiliary fields . after integrating over the auxiliary fields , @xmath158",
    "is recovered from @xmath159 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath160  in @xmath158  is @xmath161  in @xmath159 .",
    "the gap equation of @xmath159  gives the dispersion relation @xmath162the gap @xmath163  vanishes at four nodes @xmath164 .",
    "so , naturally gapless excitations can contribute to conductivity .",
    "this makes the conductivity for a d - wave superconductor gapless . in the s - wave case , however , the gap is isotropic and does not vanish in any direction leading to a hard gap in conductivity .",
    "if we change the gauge field perturbation to @xmath165 , then there will be response from @xmath166,@xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "@xmath169 satisfies the same differential equation as eq.([ax ] ) : @xmath170this shows that the conductivity is isotropic:@xmath171this might seem surprising at the first sight because the condensate is not isotropic .",
    "however , this is a consequence of the symmetries that @xmath172  has in the d - wave case . in the linear response theory ,",
    "@xmath88  is a current - current correlator which can be schematically denoted as @xmath173 \\right\\vert \\omega \\right\\rangle $ ] , where the matrix element denotes an ensemble average . under a @xmath34  rotation along the @xmath174-axis ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath175 , where @xmath176  is an anti - symmetric tensor , and assuming the ensemble average is governed by properties of the ground state which has the condensate structure of eq.(vev ) , so @xmath177",

    "this implies @xmath180  and @xmath181 . a similar analysis with parity operator with respect to the @xmath31-axis gives @xmath182 .",
