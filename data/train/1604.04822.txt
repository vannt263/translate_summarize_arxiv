    "the first results of the lhc run at 13 tev has shown surprising hints of a new resonance in the diphoton channel with invariant mass of 750 gev @xcite , which clearly represents a signal of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the atlas collaboration collected 3.2 fb@xmath3 of data and reports a signal with significance of 3.6 @xmath4 ( local ) , which becomes 2.3 @xmath4 ( after lee ) @xcite , while the cms collaboration collected an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb@xmath3 and reports a significance 2.6 @xmath4 ( local ) that became 2.0 @xmath4 ( after lee ) @xcite .",
    "as tentative as the signal could be , it has motivated a large number of studies that attempt to reproduce its profile ( for some works see for instance @xcite ) .",

    ", the yukawa matrices can arise through non - renormalizable operators .",
    "the higgs spectrum of these models could include light higgs - flavons , which could mix with the scalar bosons . in these models ,",
    "the diagonal flavor conserving ( fc ) couplings of the sm - like higgs boson could deviate from the sm , while fv couplings could be induced at small rates too , but still produce detectable signals . on the other hand , extending the higgs sector of the sm opens up the possibility of including a scalar dark matter ( dm ) candidate , such as occurs with the well studied inert doublet model ( idm ) .",
    "there are important motivations to supplement this model with a complex singlet , for instance to have extra sources of cp violation , as in the idm with a complex singlet ( idms ) recently studied @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility that the 750 gev diphoton resonance @xcite , could be identified with a low - scale higgs - flavon field @xmath0 .",
    "we work within a sm extension of the idms - type that contains two higgs doublets and one complex fn singlet .",
    "the mixing of the doublet and the singlet induces fv in the higgs sector at the tree - level , which can accommodate the lfv higgs decay @xmath7 searched for at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we consider a multi - higgs model including one sm - like higgs doublet @xmath8 , an inert - type doublet @xmath9 , and one fn scalar field ( sm singlet @xmath10 ) . the possibility of having light higgs - flavon fields was studied in ref .",

    "an extensive analysis of the cp - violating version of this potential was presented in ref .",
    "for the cp conserving case , imposing the minimization conditions for @xmath26 results in the following relations :    @xmath27    since we are considering a cp - invariant potential , the cp - even ( real ) and cp - odd ( imaginary ) components of the mass matrix do not mix .",
    "thus , the mass matrix for the real components in the basis @xmath28 is given by :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 .",

    "the higgs - flavon field @xmath12 is assumed to have flavor charge equal to -1 , such that @xmath52 is @xmath53-invariant .",
    "then , the yukawa couplings arise after the spontaneous breaking of the flavor symmetry , i.e. @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the higgs - flavon vacuum expectation value , while @xmath56 denotes the heavy mass scale , which represents the mass of heavy fields that transmit such symmetry breaking to the quarks and leptons . for specific structures of yukawa matrices for each fermion type ,",
    "see @xcite .    in the mass eigenstate basis",
    "we have the following lagrangian for the higgs - fermion couplings    @xmath57 ( c_{\\alpha } h + s_{\\alpha } h_f ) \\nonumber \\\\              & & +   \\frac{v } { \\sqrt{2 } u }   [ \\bar{u}_i \\tilde{z}^u u_j   +   \\bar{d}_i \\tilde{z}^d d_j                  +   \\bar{l}_i\\tilde{z}^l   l_j ]   ( -s_{\\alpha } h + c_{\\alpha } h_f + i a_f)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , the information about the size of fv higgs couplings is contained in the @xmath58 matrices .",

    "moreover , since the higgs couplings to first generation fermions are highly suppressed , in order to study the fv higgs coupling , which depends on the @xmath58 matrices , we will consider a 2nd-3rd family sub - system .",
    "namely , for up quarks the @xmath66 matrix ( in mass eigenstate basis ) , is given by :    @xmath67    and similarly for down quarks and leptons .",

    "the parameter space of the model must be tightly constrained , though a tiny area consistent with the experimental data still would survive . furthermore , in this scenario the total decay width of the higgs - flavon would be of the order of a few gevs , as preferred by the cms data , and decays channels such as @xmath105 and @xmath106 would be highly suppressed , with branching ratios below the @xmath136 level .",
    "another possibility is that a pseudoscalar higgs - flavon @xmath45 predicted by the model could be identified with the 750 gev resonance , but the analysis and conclusions would be rather similar .",
    "a definitive conclusion could be drawn once more data are available .",
    "we also examined other scenario in which the higgs - flavon is not identified with the 750 gev resonance . in this case",
    "there is an area of the parameter space in which it is feasible that the decay @xmath105 could have a significant branching ratio , which would open up the possibility for its study at the lhc .",

    "<S> higgs - flavon fields appear as a part of the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism , which attempts to explain the hierarchy of yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility that the 750 gev diphoton resonance recently reported at the lhc13 , could be identified with a low - scale higgs - flavon field @xmath0 and find the region of the parameter space consistent with cms and atlas data . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the extra vector - like fermions of the ultraviolet completion of the fn mechanism are necessary in order to reproduce the observed signal . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a standard model ( sm ) extension that contains two higgs doublets ( a standard one and an inert one ) and one complex fn singlet . </S>",
    "<S> the inert doublet includes a stable neutral boson , which provides a viable dark matter candidate , while the mixing of the standard doublet and the fn singlet induces flavor violation in the higgs sector at the tree - level . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the parameters of the model are derived from the lhc higgs data , which include the search for the lepton flavor violating decay of the sm higgs boson @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that in some region of the parameter space the model may give rise to a large branching ratio for the @xmath2 decay , of the order of 0.1 , which could be searched for at the lhc . </S>"
