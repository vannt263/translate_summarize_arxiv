    ", the possibility of performing analog simulations of model hamiltonians , using cold atoms in optical lattices@xcite , has raised great hopes .",
    "the remarkable controllability of cold atom systems , allowing , for example , the application of a specific time - dependent perturbation , has also opened the possibility of studying strongly correlated systems in regimes inaccessible to solid state materials , especially away from equilibrium . among",
    "all model hamiltonians relevant to the physics of strong correlations , the hubbard model has attracted the greatest attention . on one hand , this model is the simplest to have important competition between kinetic and potential energies .",
    "it also plays in the field of strong correlations a somewhat analogous role to the one played by the ising model in classical statistical mechanics . on the other hand ,",
    "its physics is of direct relevance to high - temperature superconductivity , a phenomenon still veiled in mystery .",
    "in fact , this new field often dubbed ` condensed matter of light and atoms ' was pioneered by the theoretical prediction@xcite and experimental observation of an incompressible regime , characteristic of a mott insulator , and of the transition between this phase and itinerant ones , first for bosons@xcite and recently also for fermions@xcite . for recent reviews ,",
    "see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "in order to make progress towards the ultimate goal of performing analog simulations of model hamiltonians , a good synergy between experimental efforts and theoretical investigations is crucial .",
    "for example , theoretical inputs are useful in establishing maps , in parameter space , of the location of the different phases present in a realistic setup which takes into account the trap confining potential .",
    "moreover , experiments are currently confronted with the great difficulty of cooling fermions in optical lattices to sufficiently low temperatures to reach many interesting strongly correlated phases .",
    "this relevant temperature range is significantly lower than the one corresponding to mere quantum degeneracy .",
    "theoretical control over these issues is greatly needed and requires a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of the hubbard model , both for the homogeneous system and in the presence of a trap .    in this article",
    ", we perform a comprehensive study of the thermodynamic properties of the homogeneous three - dimensional fermionic hubbard model , and of cold fermionic atoms in a three - dimensional optical lattice subjected to a trapping potential .",
    "we focus on the range of temperature which is of direct interest for current experiments as well as for the next generation of experiments .",
    "particular emphasis is put on aspects related to cooling of the system .",
    "the main theoretical technique used in the present study is dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "this approach ( reviewed , e.g. , in ref .  ) is a controlled approximation which is able to capture the competition between the kinetic energy , that tends to delocalize atoms over the whole lattice , and the repulsive potential energy that prevents atoms from occupying the same site , hence promoting localization .",
    "we also use another theoretical approach , namely high order high - temperature series expansions@xcite .",

    "this is the temperature regime of interest in current ultracold quantum gases experiments@xcite .",
    "also one should note that we often use @xmath16 .    at moderate temperature and commensurate filling ( one atom per site ) the homogeneous model displays a crossover between a liquid phase at weak interaction and an incompressible regime at larger interaction .",
    "the latter is characterized by suppressed density fluctuations and is a mott insulator .",

    "below this temperature , short - range magnetic correlations set in , which require the use of cluster extensions of dmft .",
    "hence , our study validates the use of single - site dmft for understanding experimental results on cold fermionic atoms in a 3d lattice in the currently accessible temperature range , while future experiments at lower temperature will require extensions of the method .",
    "we considered the implications of the thermodynamic properties of the homogeneous system for fermionic atoms in an optical lattice confined in a parabolic potential , within the local density approximation .",
    "a state diagram was established , with different regimes for the density profile in the trap .",
    "special emphasis was devoted to the distribution function of site occupancies in the trap , a quantity which can be experimentally measured by imaging techniques with single lattice - site resolution .",
    "such techniques have recently become available for two - dimensional systems .",
    "this distribution function proved to be of particular use when discussing how a given observable ( e.g. , temperature ) changes in the trap as the system evolves in an adiabatic manner when a parameter is varied .",
    "indeed , it allows for a clear separation of two contributions , one corresponding to the redistribution of atoms in the trap during the evolution , and another from the intrinsic change of the observable .",
    "we applied these considerations to the temperature change in the trap under an adiabatic variation of the coupling , and identified the regimes where a significant cooling can be expected .",
    "however , we would like to point out that for these results to be completely applicable to trapped cold atoms confined to optical lattices , one would need to take into account several processes that could prevent a fully adiabatic evolution .",
    "considering the effects of processes such as lattice heating will be the subject of future works .    finally , we elaborated on a previously proposed cooling mechanism , based on the separation of regions of small and large entropy .",
    "this procedure is promising for cooling further cold fermionic systems by approximately one order of magnitude , a necessary step and major future challenge for accessing and studying experimentally strongly correlated phases in those systems .",
    "_ note added : _ when the present work was near completion we became aware that another study , conducted by fuchs _ et al .",
    "_ , on the thermodynamics of the 3d hubbard model was also in its final stage .",
    "the focus of ref .",
    "is on the characterization of the low temperature region near the antiferromagnetic transition . in the temperature range where our two works overlap ,",
    "the results are in agreement .",
    "we are grateful to m.  ferrero and o.  parcollet for discussions and for sharing with us their ct - qmc code .",
    "we thank s.  wessel for providing us with the entropy data of the heisenberg model from ref .  .",

    "in this appendix , we present a very simple approximation that allows us to obtain the state diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : state_diagram ] and ref .  ) of trapped fermionic atoms in an optical lattice with very little computational effort .",
    "it also allows us to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the crossover lines in this state diagram , hence providing qualitative understanding into the numerical results presented above in this article .",
    "this approximation is based on the following approximate form of the one - particle spectral function of the homogeneous system : @xmath218 in this expression , @xmath219 is the half - bandwidth and @xmath220 is a parameter that plays the role of the mott gap ( see below ) .",
    "the rationale behind this expression is the following .",
    "when @xmath221 , ( weakly interacting regime ) it describes a density of states broadened by interaction effects . when @xmath222 , it describes two hubbard bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : analytic_dos ] ) separated by a mott gap .",
    "the contribution of quasiparticle states appearing in between the two hubbard bands are neglected , because the temperatures considered in this article are typically larger than the quasiparticle coherence scale .",
    "compared to the atomic limit , this approximation has a better behavior in the low temperature limit while still retaining a simplicity that allows for a completely analytic solution .",
    "the disadvantage of the atomic limit is that it models the zero temperature spectral function as an unrealistic pair of delta functions located at @xmath223 and @xmath11 .",
    "the atomic limit is indeed the first term of the expansion in @xmath18 and as such is valid at high temperature .",
    "our approximation instead takes into account the fact that the hubbard bands are broadened by the kinetic term .",
    "the result is in better agreement with the dmft data at temperatures lower than the limit of validity of the atomic limit .",
    "our approximation eventually breaks down due to the fact that at low temperature the details of the shape of the hubbard bands become more relevant and the box - like model of the bands shows its limits . in this sense",
    ", our approximation should only be regarded as acceptable at high temperature .",
    "this form of the spectral function leads to the following expression of the dependence of the particle number on chemical potential : @xmath224 in the zero - temperature limit , this expression reduces to : @xmath225 i.e. a function with steps at @xmath31 , @xmath42 and @xmath33 ( zero compressibility ) , while @xmath30 in between the steps ( liquid regions ) is approximated by a linear dependence on @xmath12 ( constant compressibility approximation ) .",
    "we regard the parameter @xmath220 as a fitting parameter , function of coupling and temperature , and perform a least square minimization of eq .",
    "[ eq : n_analytic_model ] to the dmft data to determine its value .",
    "the result of this procedure is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_vs_t ] .",
    "the fit looses in quality as we reduce the temperature and the value of @xmath11 . restricting to the high temperature and large @xmath11 region ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath220 on @xmath11 and @xmath75 can be separated to a good approximation and @xmath227 can be fit remarkably well by the law : @xmath228 where the parameter with the largest deviation is @xmath229 which shows a slight increase as a function of @xmath11 .        using the approximate expression ( [ eq : n_analytic_model ] ) of @xmath230 for the homogeneous system , it is straightforward to obtain the state diagram of the trapped system by using the relation between the scaled density @xmath133 and the chemical potential @xmath103 at the center of the trap , which reads , in the lda approximation : @xmath231 the calculations can be performed analytically in the @xmath80 limit ( we warn the reader that @xmath80 is considered here only as a formal limit in order to make an analytical calculation possible , since the approximations made in this paper are no longer valid physically in this limit ) .",
    "let us for example focus on the crossover lines which delimit the ` mc ' region in fig .",
    "[ fig : state_diagram ] ) within which the central occupancy is @xmath42 . in view of our approximate form of @xmath30 , the lower boundary of this regime",
    "will correspond to @xmath232 and the upper boundary to @xmath233 .",
    "inserting these values into ( [ eq : lda_bis ] ) and performing the integrations at @xmath80 yields the following expressions for the lower and upper boundaries of the mc region : @xmath234 @xmath235 using the above determination of @xmath220 , this provides an explicit form of the boundaries .",
    "analytical expressions can be similarly obtained for all crossover lines in the state diagram . in fig .",
    "[ fig : state_diagram_app ] we compare these approximate analytical expressions to the actual lines obtained for a dmft calculation at a low enough temperature @xmath236 and find very satisfactory agreement .",
    "finally , we note that thermodynamic quantities such as the double occupancy and the entropy can in principle be reconstructed from a given approximate expression for @xmath237 thanks to the thermodynamic ( maxwell ) relations relating their derivatives : @xmath238"
