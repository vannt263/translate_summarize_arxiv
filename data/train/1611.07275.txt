    "letting @xmath0 be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables each of which is uniformly distributed over @xmath1 , and @xmath2 be the corresponding ranks , it is well - known that the distribution of @xmath3 is the same as the distribution of a uniformly distributed random permutation in @xmath4 , the symmetric group on @xmath5 distinct letters .",
    "this result , often attributed to rnyi , of course remains true if we replace the uniform distribution with any other continuous distribution .",
    "the purpose of this note is to study two related random permutation models ; unfair permutations and their inverses .",
    "former of these models was first introduced in @xcite by following the ensuing game description.there are @xmath5 players labeled @xmath6 through @xmath5 , and @xmath7 player chooses @xmath8 independent random numbers each of which is uniformly distributed over @xmath1 , and picks the maximum , say @xmath9 , as her score .",
    "then , the resulting unfair permutation is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the player whose rank is @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is unfair in the sense that when @xmath8 is large , @xmath11 favors to have larger values , and vice versa .",
    "the motivation of @xcite for introducing unfair permutations is related to the theory of partitions , see the cited work for a relevant discussion .    for an example , let us assume that there are 4 players , and player @xmath8 , @xmath13 , picks @xmath8 random numbers @xmath14 independently each of which is uniform over @xmath1 , and that the resulting random numbers turn out to be @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "then , recalling that @xmath19 , @xmath20 and so the corresponding rank sequence is @xmath21 yielding an unfair permutation @xmath22 ( here , and below , the permutations refer to to cauchy s two - line notation .",
    "for example , @xmath23 ) in particular , let us note one more time that @xmath24 gives the player who has rank @xmath8 .    in next section we will start the discussion by introducing the inverse of an unfair permutation .",
    "then , our first main purpose is to compare inverse - unfair / unfair permutations to uniform permutations in various ways . in general , we show that statistics of these two random permutation models can behave quite differently when the underlying dependence is global , but that this is not the case when underlying dependence is only local .",
    "also , we will focus on several specific examples of both locally and globally dependent statistics .",
    "letting @xmath25 be a permutation in @xmath4 , regarding local dependence , we will analyze the number of @xmath26-descents , @xmath27 the length of the longest alternating subsequence of @xmath28 @xmath29 and the number of rising sequences of length @xmath26 , @xmath30 regarding globally dependent statistics we will focus on the two classical permutations statistics , the number of inversions and the number of fixed points , which are respectively defined by @xmath31 and @xmath32    before moving to the main discussion , let us fix some notation .",
    "first , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are used for equality in distribution , convergence in distribution and convergence in probability , respectively .",
    "@xmath36 denotes a standard normal random variable , and @xmath37 is used for constants ( which may differ in each line ) that do not depend on any of the parameters .",
    "the notations @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are reserved for the kolmogorov , wasserstein and total variation distances between probability measures , respectively . finally , for two sequences @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we write @xmath43 if @xmath44 .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : basics ] contains some basic probability computations that will be required in following sections .",
    "results of section [ sec : comparison ] compare uniformly random permutations to unfair permutations , and provides a general connection between two for locally dependent random variables .",
    "section [ sec : twoexamples ] contains a central limit theorem for three locally dependent statistics .",
    "later , in section [ sec : inversions ] , we also consider a globally dependent statistic , the number of inversions , and prove a central limit theorem . section [ sec : fixed ] is devoted to a preliminary analysis on the number of fixed points in unfair permutations .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec : conclusion ] with a discussion of two generalizations of unfair permutations .",
    "we start with a different way of interpreting an unfair permutation . as in introduction , consider @xmath5 players where player @xmath8 picks @xmath8 independent random numbers @xmath14 each of which is uniform over @xmath1 .",
    "set @xmath45 , for maximum of @xmath8 i.i.d .",
    "random numbers without further mention whenever it is clear from the context . ] and @xmath2 be the ranks of @xmath46 , respectively . define a random permutation @xmath47 by setting @xmath48 .    to see this construction on an example , let us continue with the numbers given in introduction , namely , @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then the corresponding rank sequence is @xmath49 , and so @xmath50 . noting that the corresponding unfair permutation is @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 for each @xmath53 .    more generally , denoting the corresponding unfair permutation in @xmath4 by @xmath12 , we have @xmath54 in other words , @xmath55 , and therefore we call the resulting distribution of @xmath47 to be the inverse - unfair distribution . _ from here on ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath47 denote an unfair and an inverse - unfair permutation , respectively .",
    "_    some immediate comments about relations between statistics of @xmath12 and @xmath47 are    * there are certain statistics in @xmath4 , say @xmath56 is one such example , so that @xmath57 a.s . thanks to some sort of symmetry within @xmath56 .",
    "for instance , recalling that @xmath58 is the number of inversions in a permutation @xmath25 , and noting that @xmath59 for any @xmath25 , we have @xmath60 * a generalization to the discussion in previous item can be given by the number of increasing subsequences of a permutation @xmath25 of a given length @xmath26 , denoted by @xmath61 .",
    "again , due to the underlying symmetry , we have @xmath62 * for various other statistics , though , @xmath63 . as an example , let us consider the case @xmath64 , the number of descents",
    ". taking @xmath65 , and assuming that @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 .",
    "as is easily checked , we have @xmath68 whereas @xmath69 , and so @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , we can easily go further , and even conclude that @xmath71 . * letting @xmath72 be a uniformly random permutation in @xmath4 , we have @xmath73 , and clearly there is no other distribution over @xmath4 with the same property .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 , but as we shall see in the following sections one can show that these two different distributions behave very much alike when @xmath5 is large , and when we are interested in a ` locally dependent ' statistic .    moving on to probabilistic considerations , we will now do some elementary observations that will be used repeatedly throughout the paper .",
    "first , letting @xmath47 be an inverse - unfair permutation in @xmath4 , what is the probability that @xmath75 for some given @xmath76 ?",
    "clearly , this probability would be merely @xmath77 if @xmath47 were a uniformly random permutation .",
    "in our case , letting @xmath78 be i.i.d .",
    "uniform random variables over @xmath1 ,    @xmath79    here , @xmath80 since @xmath78 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables . following the reasoning in derivation of , for @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84",
    ", one can also easily show that @xmath85 in particular , yields @xmath86 and @xmath87 also , since the inverse of @xmath88 is the same permutation , we have @xmath89 the following list provides the probability mass function of an inverse - unfair permutation in @xmath90 .",
    "1.4 in    .exact probabilities of all inverse - unfair permutations in @xmath90 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]    * another statistic of interest is @xmath91 , the maximum index that is a fixed point , defined by @xmath92 the following graph shows the behavior we obtained via the monte carlo experiment conducted for various values of @xmath5 . here , the x - axis denotes the length @xmath5 of inverse - unfair permutations and y - axis denotes corresponding @xmath93 +    + for the inverse - unfair case , we conjecture that @xmath94}{n}=\\frac{1}{2}.\\ ] ] in uniform permutation setting , we expect to have @xmath95}{n}\\leq\\limsup\\frac{\\mathbb{e}[bf_n]}{n}<1\\ ] ] * what is the asymptotic distribution of the minimum index of fixed points ?",
    "we were not able to handle this problem even in the uniformly permutation setting , and we will try to obtain precise asymptotics for this statistics along with the maximum index of fixed points in both uniform and unfair permutation statistics .",
    "in standard inverse - unfair permutation framework , @xmath7 player chooses @xmath8 many i.i.d .",
    "uniform numbers over @xmath1 and picks the maximum . what if the @xmath7 player chooses @xmath96 random numbers for some function @xmath97 ?",
    "namely , we consider @xmath5 players where player @xmath8 picks @xmath96 many independent random numbers @xmath98 each of which is uniform over @xmath1 .",
    "setting @xmath99 , and @xmath2 be the corresponding ranks of @xmath46 , respectively , we define a @xmath97-inverse - unfair permutation @xmath100 to be @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , when @xmath97 is identically equal to @xmath6 and @xmath97 is the identity function , this setting recovers the uniformly random and the inverse - unfair permutation cases , respectively .",
    "let us now provide a brief discussion on how permutation statistics may behave significantly different based on the choice of @xmath97 .",
    "let @xmath100 be a @xmath97-inverse - unfair permutation in @xmath4 , and consider @xmath102 , the number of ascents in @xmath100 .",
    "observe that we have @xmath103 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\phi(i+1)}{\\phi(i ) + \\phi(i+1)}.\\ ] ] in particular , if @xmath104 or if @xmath105 , then the asymptotic behavior of @xmath106 $ ] is different than the uniform permutation case . in this setting",
    ", there are several regimes one would like to investigate some of which are @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .    in particular , there are two extreme cases which we should mention .",
    "first , if @xmath110 then this means that the we have ascents at almost all coordinates , and so the resulting permutation is ` very close ' to the identity permutation in a certain sense .",
    "an example satisfying this occurs when @xmath108 .",
    "second extreme case is where we have @xmath111 and so this time we have descents at most places .",
    "providing an explicit example for this case is a little more tricky , and this will be revisited in @xcite .",
    "inverse - unfair permutations admit a second generalization by making use of markov chains .",
    "let @xmath112 be a markov chain starting at time @xmath113 , with state space @xmath114 , and transition matrix @xmath115 .",
    "also assume that @xmath116 .",
    "then we can define a variation of inverse - unfair permutations by saying that the @xmath7 player draws @xmath96 numbers and chooses the maximum of these .",
    "clearly , if the state space is @xmath117 , and the transition probability matrix is @xmath118 then we recover the standard unfair permutation model .",
    "however , the model is far more general thanks to the flexibility in choice of @xmath115 . in particular , depending on properties of @xmath115 such as transience , recurrence , etc .",
    ", statistics of the resulting model will differ from the corresponding unfair permutation statistics significantly .",
    "we believe that this markovian setting can be interpreted in various interesting ways , and we pursue it along with the other generalization mentioned above in @xcite .",
