    "in terms of fock basis , the state ( [ out1 ] ) reads @xmath99 where we introduced the symbols @xmath100 .",
    "we proceed now in order to find the structure of the partial transposition of the density matrix @xmath16 , which is obtained performing the operation of transposition in only one of the subsystems . from expression ( [ out1 ] ) and using permutation invariance , @xmath101 hence the partial transposed matrix of the second mode in fock basis is given by @xmath102 an arbitrary element of this matrix is @xmath103 and we have then @xmath104 unless @xmath105 , or , equivalently , @xmath106 . taking this rule into account",
    ", we choose a special ordering of the basis of the hilbert space @xmath107 so that the matrix @xmath78 has a special block structure in this ordering .",
    "let us first define the following sets : @xmath108 the notation should be clear : the elements in the set @xmath109 are vectors @xmath110 which fulfill @xmath111 , while elements in set @xmath112 are those which respect @xmath113 .",
    "the union of these sets is precisely the basis of the total hilbert space @xmath114 , but now in a different ordering , i.e. , we are ordering vectors @xmath110 according to their difference @xmath115 .",
    "if we take as our ordered basis @xmath116 , the partially transposed matrix will show the block structure @xmath117 and we write @xmath118 with each block @xmath119 having the matricial representation @xmath120 where the notation @xmath121 means the matricial representation of @xmath122 in the basis @xmath123 .",
    "thus , the state @xmath16 will be ppt iff all the blocks @xmath119 are positive semidefinite for all values @xmath124 .    to show the direct - sum decomposition in another way",
    ", we define @xmath125 ( @xmath126 amounts to the linear span of @xmath127 ) and we have the direct - sum decomposition of the total hilbert space as @xmath128 the subspaces @xmath129 are invariant under the action of the operator @xmath78 , i.e. , this operator does not send vectors from @xmath129 to a different @xmath130 .",
    "so , the operator @xmath78 should decompose as a direct - sum@xcite .",
    "as shown in appendix a , the partially transposed matrix of ( [ out1 ] ) assumes a block - diagonal structure , @xmath131 each block can be decomposed as a hadamard product of two matrices @xmath75 , with @xmath76 @xmath132 we will need the following theorem , known as the _ schur product theorem _",
    "@xcite :    the hadamard product of two positive semidefinite matrices is a positive semidefinite matrix .    to prove proposition 1 , we prove first a lemma :    the matrices @xmath133 are positive definite , for all @xmath134",
    ".    * proof . * first , starting from the definition @xmath135 , we express an arbitrary @xmath133 as a hadamard product of six matrices : @xmath136 with @xmath137 the matrices @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are rank-@xmath94 matrices , so are obviously positive .",
    "the hankel matrix @xmath138 is positive definite , since its leading principal minors of order @xmath139 have determinant @xmath140 .",
    "a similar argument holds for an arbitrary @xmath141 and thus they are all positive definite . another way to prove this is observing that the following sequence satisfies the stieltjes moment problem @xcite : @xmath142",
    "so , @xmath138 is positive definite .",
    "now , we see that @xmath143 defines a sequence that also satisfies the stieltjes moment problem . from theorem 1",
    ", the hadamard product of positive - semidefinite matrices is a positive - semidefinite matrix . also , the hadamard product of a positive - definite matrix - @xmath141 in our case - with rank-@xmath94 matrices - @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 - is positive - definite @xcite .",
    "so @xmath133 is a positive - definite matrix , qed .",
    "the proof of proposition 1 is now straightforward .",
    "since all @xmath77 are positive definite , to have all @xmath119 positive semidefinite we must have all @xmath79 positive semidefinite . but @xmath80 positive semidefinite implies , by sylvester s criterion , that all other @xmath79 are positive semidefinite , since they are principal submatrices of @xmath80 .",
    "so , all @xmath75 are positive semidefinite if @xmath80 is positive semidefinite and by the block structure of @xmath16 the state is ppt if @xmath80 is positive semidefinite , qed .",
    "for simplicity , we will construct a example of a ppt ( [ gclass ] ) with @xmath144 and @xmath16 being the output of ( [ input1 ] ) with @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the state we are considering is @xmath145 with @xmath146 we first observe that any shifted thermal state @xmath16 generated by ( [ input1 ] ) is locally equivalent to ( [ exemplo ] ) above .",
    "define the following invertible operation : @xmath147 then we have that @xmath148 is equal to the matrix ( [ exemplo ] ) .",
    "local invertible operations do not affect positivity of the partial transposed matrix , thus this special case is broad in this sense ( for the case of @xmath86 ) .    we know",
    "that ( [ exemplo ] ) is npt , since @xmath82 , implying that @xmath2 is nonclassical and thus npt , by the criterion of @xcite . also , from appendix b , we know that @xmath149 where @xmath75 . for @xmath150 , the blocks , @xmath119 are all positive definite , since the corresponding matrices @xmath79 are positive definite .",
    "when we consider the new partially transposed matrix for ( [ mix ] ) , we have @xmath151 we will now consider that @xmath90 is sufficiently small that we can neglect terms @xmath152 ; we will discuss more on this point further in this appendix .",
    "thus , in this approximation we can say that effectively we have @xmath153 .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eqt ] ) as @xmath154,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 , for @xmath150 and @xmath156 , while @xmath157 represents a perturbation with magnitude totally dependent on the value of @xmath90 .",
    "* remark : * _ since the eigenvalues of a matrix are continuous functions of its elements , we could already stop the demonstration at this point : slight variations of @xmath83 would not affect the eigenvalues of the positive blocks @xmath162 significantly and consequently its positivity . however , the constructive demonstration given here has the advantage of giving an estimate on the order of magnitude of the value @xmath83 , which is relevant experimentally_.      given a @xmath164 square matrix @xmath165 $ ] , let @xmath166 denote the deleted absolute row sums of @xmath167 . then all the eigenvalues of @xmath167 are located in the union of @xmath168 discs @xmath169 furthermore , if a union of @xmath139 of these @xmath168 discs form a connected region that is disjoint from all the remaining @xmath170 discs , then there are precisely @xmath139 eigenvalues of @xmath167 in this region .    the region @xmath171 is called the gerschgorin region of @xmath167 and the individual discs in @xmath171 are called gerschgorin discs ; the boundaries of these discs are called the gerschgorin circles .",
    "a similar result holds for the collum - sums ( corollary @xmath172 from @xcite ) , but since we are dealing with hermitean matrices it will not affect the results .",
    "we need also the following refinement ( corollary @xmath173 from @xcite ) :      since the blocks @xmath162 are all positive - definite , there exists a set of @xmath175s above which will bring all gerschgorin disks to the positive segment of the real line .",
    "also , there is a continuous of such @xmath175 s and we conclude then that a slight change in the row sums @xmath179 - which are constituted by the off - diagonal elements of the matrix - will not change the eigenvalues of a matrix , since this would correspond to a negligible deformation of the corresponding gerschgorin region .",
    "let us see how this applies to example ( [ mix ] ) .",
    "the perturbation matrix @xmath180 affects only the first row and collum of each @xmath160 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 . for the first lines of these blocks we have @xmath183 by putting the sole value @xmath83 , instead of the actual terms @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , we are doing an overstimation of the perturbation . by the equations above ,",
    "if @xmath187 , we will have that @xmath161 will remain positive , since the associated gerschgorin regions will be effectivelly unaffected .",
    "the value @xmath188 has a order of magnitude of @xmath189 ; thus we will impose for @xmath90 a conservative upeer bound of @xmath190 .",
    "we can now justify the neglecting of terms @xmath191 : their rate of decrease is much faster than the rate of decrease of diagonal elements ; also , we have not considered terms @xmath192 , which would make this rate even faster ."

    "<S> state ( [ gclass ] ) is entangled for any @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> * proof : * we use the following theorem , known as the range criterion @xcite :    for every separable state , there exists a set of product vectors @xmath43 which spans the range of its density matrix , such that @xmath44 spans its partial transposition .    a violation of at least one of the conditions of this criterion implies entanglement , thus we prove that the range of @xmath45 in ( [ gclass ] ) does not contain a single product vector . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath45 is spanned by @xmath17 - with @xmath18 - and @xmath46 as given in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqpsin ] ) and ( [ squeezed ] ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show now that assuming a product vector in the range of @xmath45 leads to a contradiction .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , let us assume that there exist complex numbers @xmath47 , @xmath48 such that @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> let us write explicitly some important terms in left - hand side of ( [ assumption ] ) : @xmath52 we disregard normalization factors , since one can always incorporate these factors in the values @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the first terms in the right - hand side of ( [ assumption ] ) are @xmath54 let us first assume @xmath55 , this implies @xmath56 , by the linear independence of the set @xmath57 - with @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> hence either @xmath59 or @xmath60 ; it is straightforward that either case would imply @xmath61 for all @xmath62 , clearly being a contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> let us then consider the case @xmath63 . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath64 ; from expression ( [ assumption ] ) , one gets @xmath65 and since @xmath17 is permutationally invariant , for all @xmath18 , we have for the first odd terms @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have for the corresponding terms @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . since @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that @xmath71 , a contradiction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is no product vector in the range of @xmath45 , implying observation 1 is true , qed . as pointed out in @xcite , it is possible to construct entanglement witnesses for these states by applying the optimization methods of references @xcite to projectors over the range of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> let us now check the conditions to obtain a ppt state . </S>",
    "<S> the following proposition relates the photocounting distribution of the input state @xmath2 to the ppt property of the output state ( [ out1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> state ( [ out1 ] ) is ppt if the following infinite - dimensional hankel matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 is positive semidefinite .    </S>",
    "<S> details of the proof are left for the appendices a and b. a crucial point is that under a special ordering of the basis of the total hilbert space @xmath73 , the partially transposed matrix of ( [ out1 ] ) assumes a block - diagonal structure , @xmath74 where each block can be decomposed as a hadamard product of two matrices @xmath75 , being both @xmath76 and @xmath77 positive matrices described in appendix b. since the hadamard product preserves positivity and @xmath77 is positive , @xmath78 will be positive semidefinite if @xmath79 is positive semidefinite . </S>",
    "<S> but through sylvester s criterion @xcite one sees that this condition can be reduced to positive semidefiniteness of @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the positivity under partial transposition can be checked by a hierarchical sequence of photocounting probabilities matrices . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a similar connection is already present in reference @xcite with regard to the stieltjes moment problem , in terms of nonclassicality exhibited by states negative under partial transposition ( npt ) . </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of our approach is the direct - sum structure in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ structure ] ) , which allows us to handle the construction of ppt states in a simple way . </S>",
    "<S> similar direct - sum decompositions of the partially transposed density matrix can be found in @xcite and bring a great deal of simplification when dealing with ppt bound entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea to obtain a ppt ( [ gclass ] ) is that the only block ( [ structure1 ] ) for the shifted - thermal state that is negative under partial transposition is the block @xmath81 , due to @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , with a suitable small squeezing parameter @xmath83 , the vacuum amplitude of the squeezed state , i.e @xmath84 will be suitably big in such a way to replace the null vacuum amplitude of @xmath16 , making the mixture @xmath45 positive under partial transposition . </S>",
    "<S> the other terms are @xmath85 , being as small as one desires , representing a small perturbation under control . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain thus :    there exists states ( [ gclass ] ) which are ppt . by observation 1 these states </S>",
    "<S> are bound entangled .    </S>",
    "<S> it is intuitive that observation 2 is true given that the eigenvalues of a matrix are continuous functions of its entries and thus a small perturbation of these values will not change the eigenvalues significantly . a constructive proof of observation 2 is left for the appendix c , where we consider the example of such states with a balanced mixture @xmath86 and a shifted - thermal state @xmath87 , that is @xmath88 with @xmath89 although in practice , for continuous variable s regime it is analytically and numerically hard to determine exactly @xcite the spectrum of @xmath45 , it is possible to obtain upper bounds for the values of @xmath90 , which guarantee a positive partial transposition . for the example considered </S>",
    "<S> , a conservative upper bound of @xmath91 has proved to be sufficient , allowing the generation of a bound entangled state in continuous variables . </S>",
    "<S> it will remain an open question whether we have found or not a _ generic _ continuous variable bipartite bound entangled state , i.e. , a bound entangled state with infinite schmidt rank @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a procedure to unconditionally prepare bipartite bound entangled states in continuous variable s regime . </S>",
    "<S> the approach assumed was to degaussify a thermal field by a photon addition process and to mix it with a squeezed vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> several minor results were developed in order to achieve this goal . particularly the links with hankel operator theory and the direct - sum structure of the partially transposed state allowed us to give bounds on the parameters that enable ppt bound entangled states to be produced . </S>",
    "<S> there are few examples of such states in continuous variables and thus the novel class ( [ gclass ] ) is interesting in its own , even if it were impossible to envisage a scheme to generate it experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> our work shows that this is not the case and that the preparation in practice is feasible , opening new possibilities in quantum information processing protocols , as well as in the theory of quantum entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we focused on thermal fields , due to their implementation simplicity in the laboratory and also due to their use in fundamental experiments as @xcite , but we stress that similar results could in principle be achieved with different classical photocounting distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our approach was to `` kill '' the vaccum contribution of the thermal state by performing a photo - addition and then replacing it with the vaccum term of the squeezed state , which is superposed with other terms . </S>",
    "<S> if one is able to produce a one - mode state satisfying proposition 1 and then could entangle its vaccum term with other convenient state , we believe it is possible to construct similar states to ( [ gclass ] ) ; this point is currently being investigated . </S>"
