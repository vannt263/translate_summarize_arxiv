    "cp - violating phases induce rather large contributions , compared to current experimental sensitivity , to the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron and of atoms @xcite .",
    "a large cp - violating phase could also have an effect on many cp - conserving observables such as the mass spectrum , the production rate and decay branching ratios of susy particles , especially the lightest neutralino as a dark matter particle ( including direct and indirect detection rates , and the relic density ) @xcite and supersymmetric higgs scalars@xcite .",
    "all these potentially interesting observable signatures are however highly constrained by the fact that no permanent edm has ever been experimentally observed .",
    "the current most stringent bounds are on the edms of the neutron @xcite , and on that of thallium @xcite and mercury @xcite atoms .",
    "specifically , the current experimental constraints on the aforementioned quantities read : @xmath0    signatures of cp - violation compatible with the bounds described above have so far been discussed in the context of scenarios where one avoids edm bounds and keeps relatively large phases with light super - particle masses via one or more cancelations among the various terms contributing to the edms @xcite .",
    "this `` cancellation '' scenario occurs typically in some very fine - tuned region is needed .",
    "] of the mssm parameter space .",
    "the goal of the present analysis is instead to examine in detail , beyond the possibility of cancelations between different cp - violating sources , how each individual phase is constrained by current edm bounds and to study under which conditions large phases are phenomenologically allowed while also keeping the relevant mass scales relatively light and thus phenomenologically interesting . instead of imposing any universality condition as in the supergravity ( sugra ) model ,",
    "we entertain here the possibility of general non - universal soft terms ( as is the case in many string - inspired models , see e.g. @xcite ) , and thus keep all the soft terms in mssm as independent variables . for concreteness , we focus on flavor diagonal phases .",
    "we defer a study of edm bounds on flavor non - diagonal phases to future work .",
    "one of our main results is that among all mssm cp - violating phases , only four are in fact strongly constrained by current edm bounds , and we study the correlations among them .",
    "we comment on the possible phenomenological implications of those phases that are not strongly constrained .",
    "part of our numerical study is based on the cpsuperh2.0 package @xcite , which includes the complete contributions from one - loop supersymmetric contributions to the edms of the electron and of quarks , one - loop and two - loop chromo - edms of quarks @xcite , 6-dimensional 3-gluon weinberg operator @xcite , and dominant contributions to 4-fermion cp - odd operators @xcite , but only a subset of the contributions of two - loop edms of electron and quarks @xcite .",
    "there exist additional higgs exchange - mediated chargino - neutralino 2-loop contributions to electron and quark edms that can become dominant in the limit of heavy sfermions @xcite and that are not included in cpsuperh2.0 package .",
    "we here take into account these contributions as well , therefore featuring the dominant 1-loop and 2-loop contributions to all the 6-dimensional cp - odd operators that generate edms of the neutron and of thallium and mercury atoms .",
    "the numerical code where all these new contributions are collected is called 2ledm , and is currently available from the authors upon request .",
    "the 2ledm code currently includes an interface to the feynhiggs package ( version 2.6.5 ) @xcite .",
    "we plan in the near future to set up a webpage for easier download of 2ledm and of related tutorials and to include an interface to the cpsuperh2.0 package .",
    "there remains an order one theoretical uncertainty with neutron and mercury edms .",
    "for the neutron edm , the uncertainty arises from hadronic physics , while for the mercury edm the source of uncertainty is associated with ( i ) atomic physics in extracting the nuclear schiff moment from @xmath1 , ( ii ) the nuclear physics going into extracting t- and p - odd pion - nucleon couplings @xmath2 from the schiff moment , and ( iii ) the hadronic physics in computing the @xmath2 in terms of quark chromo - edm operator , weinberg three - gluon operator , and cp - violating four fermion operators . ] . in utilizing the cpsuperh2.0 package to estimate the relevant edms from the edms of quarks and leptons we are relying on qcd sum rule computations @xcite of strong interaction matrix elements . for a discussion of the systematic uncertainties in our results for these quantities",
    "when different hadronic model approximations are employed we refere the reader to e.g. ref .",
    "we note also that the cpsuperh2.0 code relies on the computations of the nuclear schiff moment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and does not take into account the recent computations of refs .  @xcite .",
    "the latter two computations give an enhanced sensitivity of the nuclear schiff moment of @xmath3hg to the isoscalar , t- and p - odd pion - nucleon coupling , @xmath4 as compared to ref .",
    "moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite finds that the sensitivity to @xmath5 may be reduced by a factor of three to ten , depending on the type of interaction used .    in general , @xmath6 are dominated by quark chromo - edms rather than the weinberg three gluon operator ( the contribution is suppressed by @xmath7 ) , while in the mssm with large @xmath8 , contributions from the four fermion operators may be important@xcite .",
    "the qcd sum rule analysis implies that @xmath4 is five times less sensitive to the sum of up and down quark chromo - edms than @xmath5 is to their difference .",
    "thus , we would only expect the stronger sensitivity of the mercury schiff moment to @xmath4 to be important in small corners of the mssm parameter space where the difference of quark chromo - edms is highly suppressed compared to their average value .",
    "the possible suppression in sensitivity to @xmath5 is a potentially more serious issue .",
    "thus , one may need to relax the constraints we obtain on cp - violating phases that are driven by the @xmath3hg results in light of on - going theoretical nuclear structure developments .    with these caveats in mind , we summarize our main findings here :    * a primary impact of the new @xmath3hg result is to impose significantly more stringent constraints on the relative phase @xmath9 between the gluino soft supersymmetric - breaking mass and the @xmath10 parameter ( see below ) , while generating a strong correlation between this phase and the phase of the soft - breaking triscalar couplings involving first generation sfermions . * the neutron and thallium edm limits have a stronger impact on the relative phase @xmath11 between the wino soft mass parameter and @xmath10 than does the @xmath3hg bound , but at present there does not exist any strong correlation between @xmath11 and other phases . * a future neutron edm limit that is roughly 100 times stronger than present",
    "would both tighten the present correlations between @xmath9 and the triscalar phases while inducing strong correlations between @xmath11 and other phases .",
    "* in the limit of heavy first and second generation sfermions , the bino \" phase @xmath12 is essentially unconstrained by present edm bounds . a future neutron or electron edm measurement with @xmath13 times better sensitivity would probe the impact of this phase at a level of interest for cosmology .    in the remainder of the paper ,",
    "we organize the discussion of our analysis leading to the findings above as follows : in section [ sec : general ] , we give a general discussion about the cp - violating phase structure of the mssm , we address how each phase impacts the various edms , and we outline the eneral setup of our analysis . in section",
    "[ sec : detail ] , we investigate in detail how each phase is constrained by current edm bounds , we study the correlations between the various edm bounds on the most strongly constrained phases , namely @xmath11 , @xmath9 , and @xmath14 , and we discuss the phenomenology implications of the other loosely constrained phases .",
    "finally , we devote section [ sec : conclusions ] to our summary and conclusions .",
    "[ tab : phase2operator ]    .summary of how the cp - violating sources in mssm generate various cp - odd operators at one - loop and two - loop level .

    "the bounds on phases ( @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath14 ) from the combined 3-phase @xmath16 analysis , as shown in table [ tab : current ] , are in fact rather close to the bounds from the combined 2-phase @xmath16 analysis , for @xmath11 shown in the upper and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : phi23 ] , and for @xmath9 and @xmath14 shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phi23 ] , simply because a strong correlation only exists between @xmath9 and @xmath14 , and because the inclusion of @xmath11 does not substantially alter this correlation .",
    "comparing table [ tab : current ] and [ tab : oldmercury ] , we observe that the most significant impact of the recent update on mercury edm bound is on @xmath9 , while there is no impact on @xmath11 and only small impact on @xmath14 . this can be understood by looking at fig .",

    ", one might expect that the impact of future neutron edm experiments would be apparent when comparing table [ tab : current ] and [ tab : futureneutron ] .",
    "assuming the neutron edm limit becomes 100 times tighter than current one , the limits on all phases @xmath11 , @xmath9 , and @xmath14 , however , would only change to be , at most , a few times smaller .",
    "this is because as the neutron edm bound becomes the most stringent one for @xmath11 , @xmath9 , and @xmath14 , strong correlations among all of these three phases emerge , making the limits on all of them much larger than when the we consider limits on individual phases .",
    "this correlation arises from the presence of cancellations between various contributions associated with the different phases , a situation that has been noted previously in the literature ( see , _",

    "[ fig : phi23 ] since for the neutron , the constraints arise from the effects of _ both _ the quark edms and chromo - edms , in contrast to the situation for mercury where the chromo - edms dominate .",

    "as the edm sensitivities improve , the impact of the most strongly constrained phases on other observables will be reduced . on the other hand , the effects of the more loosely constrained phases may still be apparent . in the higgsino - gaugino sector , for example , the only loosely constrained phase is @xmath12 ( for relatively heavy first generation sfermions and small to moderate @xmath8 ) .",
    "this has important consequences in a rather wide range of phenomenological contexts , the most significant one being electroweak baryogenesis .",

    "in the present study , we analyzed the constraints from electric dipole moments on the size of cp - violating phases in the mssm , utilizing the dominant one- and two - loop contributions .",
    "we introduced the 2ledm numerical code , interfaced to cpsuperh2.0 , that encompasses all these contributions .",
    "we pointed out that not all cp violating phases in the mssm are constrained to be small by null results from edm searches .",
    "our results are summarized for the ease of the reader in table [ tab : phase2edm ] .",
    "we differentiate there between a case where the first generation sfermions are light , and one - loop contributions to edms are significant , and one where they are heavy and one - loop contributions to edms are consequently suppressed .",
    "we find that in the gaugino sector , the `` wino '' phase @xmath11 is fairly strongly constrained in both cases of light and heavy first generation sfermion masses @xmath54 , the `` gluino '' phase @xmath9 is only strongly constrained in the case with light @xmath54 , and the `` bino '' phase @xmath12 can be arbitrarily large in the case with heavy @xmath54 , and can be sizable with light @xmath54 and small @xmath55 .",
    "we note that in earlier studies that employed a universality assumption ( @xmath56 ) this difference in edm sensitivities to the different cpv phases in the gauge - higgs sector of the mssm was not apparent .",
    "turning to sfermion cp violating phases , only the stop cp violating phase @xmath44 ( and only more weakly @xmath52 ) is marginally constrained in the limits of heavy first generation squarks and sleptons . for light first generation sfermions ,",
    "rather stringent constraints arise for @xmath17 and for @xmath57 from the neutron and mercury edm bounds , and weak constraint for @xmath58 arises from the thallium edm limit .",
    "virtually no constraint exists from edms on the cp violating phases for second and third generation leptons and for second generation squarks .    in summary",
    ", we showed in this paper that even in the absence of cancellations between contributions from different cp violating phases , null results on searches for the permanent edm of the neutron and of atoms put constraints only on selected cp violating phases , leaving ample room for a rich phenomenology related to cp violation at colliders , b factories and dark matter searches .",

    "<S> we analyze the constraints placed on individual , flavor diagonal cp - violating phases in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) by current experimental bounds on the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the neutron , thallium , and mercury atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the four cp - violating phases that are individually highly constrained by current edm bounds , and we explore how these phases and correlations among them are constrained by current edm limits . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the prospective implications of the next generation of edm experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that all other cp - violating phases in the mssm are not nearly as tightly constrained by limits on the size of edms . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that a rich set of phenomenological consequences is potentially associated with these generically large edm - allowed phases , ranging from b physics , electroweak baryogenesis , and signals of cp - violation at the cern large hadron collider and at future linear colliders . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical study takes into account the complete set of contributions from one- and two - loop edms of the electron and quarks , one- and two - loop chromo - edms of quarks , the weinberg 3-gluon operator , and dominant 4-fermion cp - odd operator contributions , including contributions which are both included and not included yet in the cpsuperh2.0 package . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce an open - source numerical package , 2ledm , which provides the complete set of two - loop electroweak diagrams contributing to the electric dipole moments of leptons and quarks . </S>"
