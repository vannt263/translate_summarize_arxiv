    "completing our understanding of the electro - weak symmetry - breaking mechanism is one of the main tasks for present and future particle colliders . in the standard model ( sm ) , this is accomplished by introducing a complex @xmath0 doublet , the higgs field , which obtains a vacuum expectation value ( vev )  @xcite .",
    "three of the four degrees of freedom form the longitudinal modes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons , while the remaining one becomes a physical particle , the higgs boson .",
    "interactions between these gauge bosons and the higgs field are introduced automatically via the latter s kinetic term , while interactions with fermions are added via yukawa - type couplings . replacing the higgs field by its vev",
    "then yields mass terms for the gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "therefore , the couplings of the higgs boson to the other particles are fixed and proportional to the measured masses and the vev .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is the only remaining unknown parameter in the sm .",
    "direct searches by lep  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite and in particular the lhc experiments atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite have excluded large parts of the parameter space , leaving only a small window around 125 gev .",
    "high - mass values , where the experimental sensitivity drops again , are strongly disfavoured by indirect constraints from electro - weak precision data  @xcite . as mentioned before , the higgs couplings in the sm are completely determined by the known particle masses .",
    "therefore , we can use these theoretically predicted values and compare them to future measurements of higgs boson channels  @xcite .",
    "thereby , we assume that the discrete quantum numbers , like its cp property or spin  @xcite , are identical to the sm expectation",
    ". many models of new physics predict deviations in the higgs couplings , which can then be measured .",
    "examples include models with an extended higgs sector , like the two - higgs doublet structure e.g.  in supersymmetry  @xcite , or also higgs portal models  @xcite , but modifications can also be more elementary as in composite models  @xcite , where the higgs boson emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson of a new strongly - interacting sector .",
    "a correct treatment of all errors is important to obtain correct results . as in the higgs boson channels rates",
    "are measured , these statistical errors are of the poisson type . additionally , there are systematic errors , which are correlated , and we implement the full correlation matrix between different measurements .",
    "theory errors are best described as box - shaped  @xcite , using the prescription of the rfit scheme  @xcite . in the sfitter tool  @xcite these different types of errors",
    "are fully implemented .",
    "as output we obtain a fully - dimensional log - likelihood map , which we can then reduce to plotable one- or two - dimensional distributions via both bayesian ( marginalisation ) and frequentist ( profile likelihood ) techniques . furthermore , a list of best - fitting points is obtained .",
    "as the underlying model of our study we assume the standard model with a generalised higgs sector , where the higgs couplings can take arbitrary values .",
    "these are parametrised in the following way : couplings to particles @xmath3 , which are present at tree - level in the sm , are modified according to @xmath4 as a global sign flip of all couplings is not observable , we always take @xmath5 to be positive , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath6 . additionally , there are two important loop - induced couplings present , namely those to gluons and photons .",
    "they are altered in the following way : @xmath7 these can receive two types of contributions .",
    "first , there are contributions from changing the tree - level couplings , @xmath8 .",
    "second , there can be additional dimension - five contributions @xmath9 .",
    "they originate from new particles running in the loop , e.g.  the supersymmetric partners in susy models .",
    "the numerical values of the couplings are obtained from a modified version of hdecay  @xcite .",
    "also the masses of the higgs boson and the top and bottom quark are added as free parameters and corresponding measurements constrain them to their experimentally measured value .",
    "additionally , we define @xmath10 as a single free parameter that changes all ( tree - level ) couplings simultaneously .",
    "the total width of the higgs boson is too small to be measured directly at the lhc .",
    "therefore we have to make one single model assumption about how to treat the total width , which we take as @xmath11 this means that there are no further contributions from higgs decays into invisible particles .",
    "the assumption about generation universality is important as the higgs has a significant branching ratio of several percent into unobservable particles ( e.g.  charm quarks ) for which at the lhc there is no possibility to measure them , and neglecting them would introduce a bias .",
    "further details of the setup have been described in refs .",
    "we will not consider any couplings that can only be measured with very high luminosity or not at all .",
    "this includes the only second - generation yukawa coupling that might be measurable at the lhc , namely those to muons  @xcite , as well as the higgs self - couplings  @xcite .",
    "the measurements that enter our analysis are derived from an atlas monte carlo study performed for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath12 and assuming a centre - of - mass energy of 14 tev  @xcite .",
    "we perform a simulation with typically 5000 toy monte carlos , where we smear the signal and background expectations according to their corresponding errors , and fit the resulting higgs couplings .    .",

    "yukawa couplings to bottom quarks and @xmath13 leptons can only be determined with good accuracy for higgs masses below 140 to 150 gev , as for larger masses the corresponding branching ratios become too small .",
    "the top quark is strongly affected by the dimension - five operators without these operators the gluon - fusion production processes contribute to the precision of this coupling . including them , the top - quark coupling needs to be determined by the badly measurable top - quark - associated production modes , and gluon - fusion production then pins down the size of the additional operators relative to the top quark coupling .      to get an estimate of what to expect from the lhc in the near future",

    "<S> after the discovery of a higgs boson , the next step is to measure its properties and test their accordance with the predictions of the standard model , in particular the couplings of the higgs boson . in this talk we discuss what information the lhc will be able to give us over the coming years , and what remains as a task for a future linear collider .    </S>",
    "<S> using the well - established sfitter framework , we map measurements onto a weak - scale effective theory with general higgs boson couplings . our sophisticated error treatment allows us to take all theory and experimental errors , including arbitrary correlations , fully into account . </S>"
